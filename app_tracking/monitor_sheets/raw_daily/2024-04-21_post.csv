0,1c9wo06,AITA for traveling solo?,"The husband (41m) and I (37f) have been together since I was in hs. We had our first just after I graduated and have 6 kids together. I have been a mom and ""attached"" since I was 18. 

The husband has always had freedom in the marriage. He goes on trips, concerts, shows, etc., all the time. And so much of the time, I don't find out about it until after he's already planned and paid for it. 

I, on the other hand, have never gone on a trip solo. I almost always have a kid with me, him or my mom. And most of my travel is for a kid or business. 

So, later this year, I am going on two trips 100% on my own. I have paid for them on my own with my side jobs and businesses. 

Yes, he knew about the trips beforehand. Neither he cares too much about nor would he have fun, or be fun to be with (he has a drinking problem he refuses to acknowledge and it's not fun when I don't drink and he drinks WAY TOO MUCH, but that's an entirely different issue). 

Anyway, last night, he was dunk and I was picking him up, and he decided to get upset/offended that I'm seeing a band alone. He doesn't care for the band. He told me to take someone else. I chose to go alone. 

But now, he's decided I hate him and is being very distant/standoffish today. 

It's frustrating that this is our marriage lately, but again, another issue. 

I feel like it's just another thing as I'm going through personal development challenges and growing as a person and woman, finally finding power. 

I think he's feeling triggered, but isn't in a headspace to have a conversation about it.

1,1c9wkyb,AITA for saying the truth about my sister?,"We were at my cousin's birthday party and there were two more of my cousins, which we'll call Charlie (celebrated person sister) and Angelina + my sister and me.
Basically, at this party the four of us stayed together basically the whole time. But my sister always has to make fun of me whenever she's out with her friends or, apparently, even our cousins. She always did this even with her friends because she wanted to look cool or something, and I could never do anything about it because she'd get offended if I did (Ex.: she made fun of my scars, I have dermatillomania, so of course this is very hurtful for me because they are literally on my face, so i can't hide them if not with lots of makeup, which she also makes fun of. I got tired of this and said something about her pimples and she started playing victim).
Point is, at one point I got absolutely fed up because she kept humiliating me like she always does. We were all together, in front of other family members, talking about our age differences because Angelina thought me and my sister had 2 years of difference when we have just 1 but almost two and some other stuff, and at one point I said to my sister, who celebrated her birthday a couple of months prior: ""she would've known if you had invited her to your birthday party."" And she threw me a look, as well as my mother, while my Charlie said I was right.
I want to say I'm absolutely not sorry for this, since also Angelina doesn't usually invite us to her birthday parties (we did meet her in restaurants with some other cousins but not us), and i am absolutely not mad at her for this because it's her birthday party and she has the right to, but my mother still complained because ""saying stuff like this isn't nice"".

3,1c9wdo1,AITA For Yelling Back At My Dad?,"I (16F) live in a very conservative household, my parents are the average African Parents(no need for an explanation there) very strict, very homophobic, you get the point. But the problem is that my dad has really bad anger issues and he’s had them for years, he yells at everyone for the littlest things and is very quick to raise his voice or threaten someone and all of my family members just deal with it For example, last week I was playing video games after school and cleaning the house since my mom was at work, and he came into my room and asked me to open the living room window. And I nicely told him “Okay just give me a second and I’ll do it.” And than he blew up saying things like “your dumb game is really more important than this? Stop being lazy and get up.” And I tried to get him to understand that this was competitive and that I’d probably get a penalty but he kept getting more aggressive and louder and louder so I just got up and did it an accepted the loss. That’s pretty much what the last 16 years of my life has looked like.
Now for the issue at hand. It was around 11:00 on a Friday and I was playing a game with my friends having a good time and laughing and my father called me and my siblings to come pray (my family is religious) and I didn’t know that we were goin to be praying or I wouldn’t of started a game (competitive) and usually when it’s just me and my mother out of politeness she usually gives us all a heads up, but he never does since he thinks his time is more valuable than ours, so now my whole family is waiting for me and I can sense that my dad is getting more & more tense because he keeps sending one of my siblings to come get me (mind you it’s been less than 5 minutes) so after the 2nd time I once again just take the loss and get up and since I have noise cancelling headphones I didn’t hear how loud he was yelling so when I got to where everyone was it shocked me. He was saying rude and hurtful things like, “you always make us wait for you do you think you’re special?”, etc. And I honestly don’t remember when I started yelling back but I did and we got into a nasty spat, leading him to call me an idiot and an imbecile and make misogynist comments and saying that I could leave when I turn 18 and that I’m not his only daughter, and instead of my family defending me they all kept telling me to just stop and shut up, so I did. And he went on and on just yelling and threatening me and saying that I’ve accomplished nothing in my life and that I’m incredibly disrespectful and not even my mother said anything about it. Currently my whole family thinks that situation was my fault and it honestly kinda hurts, I’ve never been close with my dad.

5,1c9w5tf,AITA for asking my friend to pay when we go out?,"
My(17f) best friend, “Avery” lost her dad a couple years ago. Since then, her family’s been struggling financially, so every time we’ve hung out, or gone out to eat, I pay for both of us. I don’t mind, because usually my parents will give me 20 bucks and so I’m not actually spending my money. 

A couple weeks ago was our Spring Break, and the language department organized a trip to Europe that cost ~$5000 dollars per person. 

Every time I asked Avery if she wanted to hang out over break, she’d give me an excuse. Over the past couple weeks I’ve seen everyone posting pictures of the trip and it turns out Avery went with them. 

 I feel lied to because she was not honest about why she couldn’t hang out, and hurt that she’s made me pay for everything and then spent several thousand dollars on this trip. 

I decided to be upfront because I didn’t want it to cause any lasting resentment, and I asked her about it. She got defensive, and said I had no right to shame her for how she spent her money, that it was none of my business and that she deserved to enjoy herself too. She does of course but it felt deceitful that she had me pay for everything thinking she actually couldn’t afford it when she clearly could. I asked her if she could start paying for herself when we hang out, and she responded that just because she splurged once didn’t mean she had spare money all the time.

Due to my addiction we lost contact for a couple of years. 2016 I moved for uni and in 2017 my sister did the same. To make amends I let her stay with me in my 1 room apt. We really bonded which felt great. 2018 she moved back but we stayed in touch. 

2021 I get a text from her mom saying that my sister has been drinking taking pills and she doesn't know what to do. I tell her to take her to the ER but she takes her home instead. I call my sister and she tells me she has a drinking problem since she was 14. She says she drinks 8 bottles wine a week + 4 big bottles vodka. I say I'm worried and that if she wants I can arrange for someone to meet up with her for a meeting. My sister declines and I know you can't force anyone to recover, being an addict myself. We met up and she denies everything.

2022 I'm at a house call at work with my boss. She calls me 4-5 times in a row I call her asap. She has locked herself in the bathroom at work and she's drunk and crying. I told her she needed to take help but she refused. The next day she didn't want to talk about it. That happened a few more times and I tried to motivate her to take help but she refused. I finally said I'd call social services or her mom if it happens again. She stopped calling.

Spring 2023 she gets an apartment and in August we’re going on a road trip. We spent 4h in the car and she is on edge. She's easily agitated and I give her space suspecting it's from not drinking. When we get to the cottage she throws a tantrum when I ask her for help to carry our stuff to the cabin. She screamed and I was very tired from driving so when we got inside I try to change the mood by saying like ""oh look at this, so cute!"". I got no answer, she didn't speak to me for 3 hours. I was 40 min from my home and I considered going home. I asked her if she was gonna ignore me for the entire vacation and she stat yelling. I said I'm not taking it and I'm leaving but she can come along. She refused but reconsidered and went with me to town. I dropped her where she could get a bus and sent her around 200 pounds (her part of the glamping). I sent her a text later ""Hi, I hope you have a safe night and found someplace to stay. I wish we could talk another time.” She answered no after 24h.

I've contacted her several times after this, afraid I've lost her. I felt stupid for not doing more about her alcoholism, so I called her mom. I said she called me drunk from work and that I was very worried. She brushed it off like it was all in the past. I just didn't want to be the only one knowing that she has a problem.

Before NYE my sister contacted me. She was furious for contacting her mom. She felt belittled and robbed of her integrity. She said if I don't understand this she wants nothing to do with me. I stood by what I did and our messages got ugly as I told her to stop drinking. I feel like shit. So AITA?

I was 40 min from my home and I considered going home. I asked her if she was gonna ignore me for the entire vacation and she stat yelling. I said I'm not taking it and I'm leaving but she can come along. She refused but reconsidered and went with me to town. I dropped her where she could get a bus and sent her around 200 pounds (her part of the glamping). I sent her a text later ""Hi, I hope you have a safe night and found someplace to stay. I wish we could talk another time.” She answered no after 24h.

I've contacted her several times after this, afraid I've lost her. I felt stupid for not doing more about her alcoholism, so I called her mom. I said she called me drunk from work and that I was very worried. She brushed it off like it was all in the past. I just didn't want to be the only one knowing that she has a problem.

Before NYE my sister contacted me. She was furious for contacting her mom. She felt belittled and robbed of her integrity. She said if I don't understand this she wants nothing to do with me. I stood by what I did and our messages got ugly as I told her to stop drinking. I feel like shit. So AITA?

9,1c9vbfj,AITA for refusing to attend church?,"I (17F) have gone to church every Sunday for my entire life up until a few years ago. Really, more than every Sunday as I was always made to attend private Catholic schools (usually involving monthly to daily mass). Needless to say, I've attended my fair share of theology classes, Catholic events, etc. However, I would definitely consider myself atheist now. 

Recently, after a few years of freedom, my mom decided it was necessary to force me into attendance again. This has often caused me to have quite an emotional reaction as I HATE going. Not just because I feel like its a waste of time, but it feels extremely condescending to hear the priest pray for/talk down on non-believers. I'm also feminist and a lesbian so you can imagine. This has caused massive fights within my family as I've tried to argue that attending church makes me feel ostracized and only pushes me further from Catholicism. However, my mom continues to argue that it's a family activity and that I need to suck it up.

This came up again this Sunday as, after a few weeks of not attending, I was woken up by my adult sister (who is also Christian) and told to get ready.

10,1c9va0v,AITA for getting upset after not being invited to my friends birthday party after I invited her to mine?,"Am i (17 y/o female) an a!!hole? 

Backstory my birthday was April 1st & I was planning on doing a big rollerskating event with 40+ people however I soon realized this would not be possible due to my work schedule, so I decided on doing an escape room with six of my closest friends. 

One of which Who we will be calling”chi” wasnt sure if he would be able to make it due to other events. It is important to add that another one of my friends that we’ll call “bry” shares the same birthday as me & he was also invited to the event so I made sure I invited our mutuals from school who i know he is close to aswell.  Anyways, I had purchased seven tickets for six of my friends and one for me totaling out to about $275 so when chi stated he may not be able to come another one of my friends who we will call”jt” Invited one of her friends who we’ll ”lala” as a replacement for chi( i tend to hold my tongue in situations like this because i dont like being mean or rude ).

I am not close to lala at all, but I did encourage her being invited to my rollerskating event since it would be a lot more people and a lot more space

Lala used to go to my school, but she was never my style. She was disrespectful always high or drunk And was getting tattoos without her parents knowing by the time she turned 15. I really was not convinced that an escape room would be her thing which is why jt was welcomed to bring her to the skating rink because it is a bigger event and i specifically chose the people i did with the intent of getting out in time not just to say we went

The day of my birthday comes around and im putting the possibility that chi may be coming so lala might have to stay home (she didn’t  even tell me hbd so i didn’t think she would care) but JT kept making up Excuses on why she should come. I told her that she may not be comfortable around a bunch of people. She does not know because the only person she knew well was JT. 

It’s now about an hour and a half before our reservation and I got good news that chi will be able to come so I tell JT that lala would have to sit this one out and do rollerskating like i planned for (since i never even invited her in the first place) because she is more of the party type and I think she would enjoy that more.
When JT shows up to the escape room, she does not look like she wants to be there and she’s giving me weird vibes. When we were done with the escape room(only an hour long). She ended up leaving my party to go see lala

JT‘s birthday is coming up and she’s having a party that she did not tell me about even though I had already purchased her gift and she told me that she was not doing anything. when I brought it up to her She told me that her “loyalty lies w/ her “sister” and she did not invite me because I disrespected her meanwhile every time I see her in school, she gives me a hug and acts like everything‘s alright AITA?

Nana (79F) has always been abusive. She isn't actually disabled, but acts like she is, expecting mom to act like a kind of personal slave, does Nana want a tea but her favorite show is playing?, she will get angry if mom doesn't rush to get her said tea, refuses to believe mom is in pain, saying she's just ""too lazy"".

Nana views mom as some sort of secondhand thing just because she never married, and was a single mom. Nana's golden child is uncle Dan (51M), and will always compare him with mom, even though he went LC with her long ago and will just send her $60.00 to ""live on"" (doesn't need it, Nana hoarded a good sum of money when grandpa passed, and is always forcing mom to buy her shit, thus spending her disability and the money I give her).

Now, there is me, I don't cook or do chores, I work at home and take care of the bills, give mom money for her stuff and do my best to spoil her. That's our arrangement. She loves cooking so I buy her whatever she needs for her recipes (delicious food that Nana will find a way to find disgusting), she will bring me coffee or snacks to my desk, will braid my hair daily, and just spoil me rotten.

My fiancee Eric (35M) knows this, at first he was shocked when he saw the amount of attention I get from mom, but slowly started to crave her food, getting used to fresh lemonade when he comes in, and overall being babied, with a smile, because she likes doing so. So when I talked about the situation to him, he suggested we took mom to live with us when we marry next year. To say m was happy is too little, she's excited to move in with us and already planning her daily routine and what she will cook for us. Eric, on his side, has decided he will also give her a similar amount of money as me, in exchange of her care.

The only one unhappy is my uncle, he has been outraged ever since I called him to let him know he has to do something about Nana as she will no longer have my mom to slave away for her, trying to change my mind because ""his wife dislikes nana, and he is not going to ruin his marriage by bringing her to live with him"". On his desperation, he asked me to meet today for breakfast, when I arrived to the place, he started berating me for being ""selfish"" and trying to ""harm his family by imposing them to care for Nana"", he also accused me of ""being lazy and treating my mom like a servant"". I said I am not changing my mind and he left in a huff, now the whole family is blowing my phone, asking how can I be that heartless towards a ""sweet old lady""

This year I did not get a raise, and they even decreased my commission plan in a way that I earn 20% less. I regularly discuss this stress with a close friend of mine.

14,1c9v02t,AITA for saying my boyfriend isn't shredded enough to be Superman?,"My bf “Steve” and I are going to a costume party next weekend and are looking for costume ideas. Over this past weekend we had dinner with some friends and they gave us some suggestions. One friend pointed out that Steve kind of looks like Clark Kent and suggested that we go as Superman and Wonderwoman. Suddenly everyone was going around the table saying how he looks like Clark Kent. They were not wrong–Steve is tall and muscular with dark hair, blue eyes and glasses–but Steve has a belly and love handles where Superman has v-lines and washboard abs, and I feel like those are defining features of Superman.

Steve is pretty comfortable with his appearance. He used to be super shredded and he knows how much dedication it takes to be that way, but he’s decided to focus his attention on other things instead of spending every minute of every day worrying about his body. He still works out 5-6x/week and jokes about how he used to be shredded and is no longer, which is why I thought it was appropriate to say “Well Steve would have to put in some serious work in the gym if he wants to look like Superman” in a lighthearted tone. I thought everyone would laugh at me because we all know how much Steve works out, but they all looked at me stone faced.

There was immediate fallout after. People accused me of body shaming my boyfriend and told me that if I can’t appreciate how handsome he is then I should leave him for someone who can. I tried to clarify that it is a joke and that Steve makes similar jokes all the time, but they said I shouldn’t make his body the butt of my jokes, and that it’s different if he says it versus if I say it. Steve said it was fine and suggested we get going, so we paid our part of the bill and then left.

On the car ride home I apologized, asked Steve if he was okay and told him we could go as Wonderwoman and Superman if he wanted to.

You're given the opportunity to hand out invites to family and friends.

My partner, Steven (M27) works in an office that's only a short bus ride away from my uni, I usually go over and meet him in the lobby once he's done. I'm always half surprised to see him all dressed up in his corporate gear, he's an artist like me (though more in a literary sense, he writes beautiful poetry), but somebody has to pay the rent and for our son's nursery so he puts up with it.

The people Steven works with are insufferable according to him. Apparently they're all very crass and unable to hold their own original opinions, he's either ragged or completely ignored by his male coworkers. In his entire time working at the office, only one person has been even slightly friendly to him and that's Christine (F30). I've met her once or twice, she's very smothering. She thinks that her narrow world view is the only correct one, and her whole look and personality is very...love Island candidate. She's quite overbearing to Steven, she always practically begs him to walk her to the train station, she insists on them going to lunch in cafes that are awfully twee, he is apparently constantly hounded by her. Steven said that he used to spend breaks by himself in the basement of the office, until she found out about it and now he doesn't get a moment's peace.

Anyway, I was waiting for him in the lobby last week and I was very excited to give him the exhibition invite + leaflet.

That upset her, she started telling me that I was a 'stuck up little cow,'  for making assumptions.

16,1c9uyvf,AITA for reacting poorly to my partner’s haircut?,"Throwaway for this one just cause I would like to know how to approach this situation.

My partner and I went to the salon to get our hair done. They wanted to get their hair cut a little shorter and gave the hairdresser specific instructions, cut a few inches on the top, an inch on the side. 

I finished my haircut early and turned to notice that their hairdresser had taken clippers to their head and started shaving the back of it. I assumed they wanted to try something new and didn’t question it. 

When they came out, I found that the hairdresser had actually shaved their entire head off (against their will? the hairdresser must’ve misunderstood from what i can tell) and I had a pretty bad reaction. For context, I was taken advantage of when I was younger by my mom’s boyfriend and he had the same haircut. My partner looked like a younger version of the dude. I panicked when we left the salon. 

When I calmed down, I apologized a lot to my partner. I did not want them to feel like I reacted that way because I thought they were unattractive, I just couldn’t help it in that moment. I was really scared and a lot of gross memories slipped into my brain. My partner and I have already talked about it, they said it was okay and just to be a little more empathetic because they didn’t ask for this haircut either.

My brother has had three separate stages while we played SSBU. First phase: when he loses a lot (by that I mean ~3-4 games), he throws a tantrum. This ended up breaking one of our controllers. His second phase, he would end up “banning” some of my mains. God help me if my cursor even hovered on Luigi. So, I had to improvise. I established a new main. He banned that one too.

He would still lose. I could pick any character, he could pick any character, and I would win 8 times out of 10. Why? Because he’s predictable. I’ve told him time after time again, “Bro, you’re too predictable, switch it up.” What does he do? Nothing. He continues diving toward me and getting punished for making the same mistake over and over and over again.

Now, sure, there’s a skill gap the size of the Atlanatic Ocean between us. Time after time, he’s told me again and again, “dude, you need to chill! Step down to my level!”

Which… what? You’re digging your own grave, and you want me to hop on in? No thanks! I would always respond with, “you just need to get better. There’s hundreds of professionals you can watch so you can properly play the Ice Climbers. Their skill ceiling surpasses the exosphere, you just need to watch one video!”

Would he listen? Take a wild guess (no). That’s how predictable he is in SSBU, too. So, his mistakes? Never switches it up, never improves (or wants to), and he continues remaining ignorant. “He’s the problem, not me!” Is what he’s been telling himself for *FOUR YEARS.* He hasn’t watched a SINGLE video! There’s a shit ton of Ice Climbers videos out there, I could probably go through his history and find 1 or 2 unfinished videos because his attention span rivals a baby’s.

Then again… is it my fault? While Gavin celebrates every win like it’s his birthday, when I win, I just sit there awkwardly because I feel bad that he’s not winning.

19,1c9u9j4,AITAH for posting Taylor Swift memes in a gc?,"So, I inherited friends from my partner and they have a huge group chat (20+ people) where they post memes, arrange socials, etc. .  There have been a lot of memes on the internet this weekend about Taylor swift’s new album, specifically the lyrics and the music sounding ai generated (you probs saw them if you’re here).  Because I know we have a few music people in the gc, including a singer song writer and a guy that’s in a wedding band, I posted two of the v tame Taylor swift memes I had seen on my travels with the hope of generating some intellectual conversation about it.  

It did in fact start generate a comment, which was p much along the lines of “haven’t personally listened but a few friends told me it sounds generic”.  This sparked someone in the gc to express their dislike for “all the Taylor swift slander in the gc” and asked us to keep our thoughts on it out of the gc for their sake.  Ofc this then started a full conversation about how saying “my friend said it’s all generic sounding” isn’t slander it’s just an opinion with all 20+ group members saying something both about the aforementioned and the music.  The offended person then left the gc and told their partner and mine that I was an AH for posting the memes in the first place and that I was the person slandering TS in the gc that caused their initial distress and comment.  

AITAH for posting memes?

Edit with some details on the conversation sparked by the memes.

The memes were one meme about the lyrics of one song and the second was about ai generated lyrics with a crying TS under it.  imo nothing wild and nothing disrespectful.

The conversation sparked by the memes was just the one comment mentioned above of “haven’t personally listened but a few friends told me it sounds generic” and the offended person saying they were offended.  The conversation after that was mostly about the message about being offended and the “slander”, no mention or reply to the memes at all.  

As for my participation in that conversation, I did a few thumbs ups to neutral messages about it sounding all very similar to other works of hers and I did one message reply to someone who said they liked the song she did with Florence + the Machine where I said “I also liked this song cause I’m a fan of Florence Walsh”.  Other than that I was p quiet and just observed as it was a p fast paced chat with a lot of constructive comments on the music.  No one said anything explicitly bad about the music outside of it all sounding the same in their opinion, no one said they hated it, no one was rude to the offended person.

21,1c9u23z,AITA for not cleaning my mom’s house after she paid me $200?,"
I (24F) was kicked out of my Moms house last year and have been living with my boyfriend since. My mom is planning on buying the house she’s been renting for the past 11 years which has obviously been a stressful process as she’s coming up with the down payment. She wanted the house cleaned for the appraisal to try to get it as high as possible so she paid me $200 3 weeks ago to clean up the basement I used to live in that hadn’t been cleaned since I was kicked out.
 I agreed to clean and came over on a Friday night after work where I dusted the entire basement, threw out 4 trash bags worth of stuff and cleaned the cat box that was downstairs. By the time I was done with all that, it was already dark out and I had to go home to take care of my dogs and feed them dinner. I told my mom the only task left to do was to vacuum and mop the floor in the common area and vacuum and clean up in my old room. 
I was planning on dog sitting for my mom the following weekend (unpaid) as she was going to visit my sister so I agreed to finish vacuuming and mopping when I came over again. The very next day she called me and was very upset that I didn’t “finish the job” and my mom ended up vacuuming and mopping herself. The rest of the week my phone was being blown up by my mom calling and texting me daily that I “never help her” and that I wasn’t doing enough to help her. The weekend finally rolls around after dealing with her texts all week and I stayed at her house for a day and a half to watch over her 3 dogs and 4 cats and continue to clean. Before I got there I went an hour out of my way to a tractor supply to get dewormer because she requested I deworm the animals. I bought $50 worth of dewormer with my own money for all the animals and got clawed to shit deworming all the cats. While I was there, I fed the animals, cleaned the cat boxes, scrubbed the backyard bricks with natures miracle (since they smelled like piss and she requested I do so) and cleaned out another 2 trash bags worth of shit from her house. 
This apparently still wasn’t enough. This weekend my mom asked me to come over to help move laundry machines from her garage to the street as well as vacuum and clean out even more crap. I was happy to help her out but the entire week leading up to this weekend, she had held the fact that she already paid me and the job “wasn’t done” over my head. 
When I woke up this morning I had a 4 paragraph text from my mom that “I hadn’t finished the job” and that I needed to be at the house before 6 pm. This would have been fine if she asked me nicely. A simple “what time are you coming over?” Would have sufficed but instead she wrote 4 paragraphs stating I didn’t do a good job the first time and needed to make up for it.

My job is completely remote, while his is in person, so on the days he works, I agreed to watch Nala so he doesn't have to dish out extra money, paying for a dog sitter or daycare.

Since he got Nala, I have taken care of both dogs every day that he is at work and since I take Arty on walks everyday, I take Nala as well because it just seems wrong to not, since I'm walking Arty anyways.

Recently, I've been having to work late so I haven't had the time to take them on an afternoon walk before the sun goes down, while my roommate has been getting home earlier.

Because he's been getting home earlier, he takes Nala on a walk and not Arty (my dog).

Because of this I started doing the same thing and only walking Arty, my dog.

Last night when we were grabbing a drink with our mutual friends she went on about their latest argument. About what? They were fighting about where to eat and the way she described it, it was a full on fight about what restaurant to pick. 

For some reason I snapped and just told her I don’t give a shit about her relationship troubles and that if they fight about stupid shit like this then they aren’t meant for one another. 

She called me a jerk and left. My other friends told me that they understand my frustration but I shouldn’t have snapped like that. So I’m wondering, aita?

Edit: just to make one thing clear over the course of their relationship I have urged her multiple times to leave him and even told her that his toxic but to no avail so I just gave up ",0.0,0.070369266,0,1
25,1c9telx,AITA for thinking I unclogged my hookup’s toilet and it didn’t?,"So last night, I (22M) matched with a woman (26F) on Tinder, and it led to me at her house an hour later. I had been eating a hearty meal while I was texting her, and then when she said come over, I didn’t hesitate. By the time I got there, the meal had made its way lower, and I needed to go before I moved. I asked if I could use her bathroom before we started, she said yes.

If you’ve seen Dumb and Dumber, it was that strong. Idk what I had done before, but that was the toughest bowel movement I’ve had in a while. It clogged the toilet, so I fixed it. Shut off the toilet water, found the plunger, coated said plunger in bowels, and got the toilet to a point where I thought it wasn’t clogged anymore based on the water going down. I turned the water back on, cleared the plunger, and called it there. Went back to her after 20 minutes, we got to work. I didn’t tell her about the clog because I thought I fixed it, and I didn’t want to ruin the moment.

After we finished, we got to laughing and talking, and before you knew it, I left her place about three hours later. Got home, and maybe an hour later, I get a phone call asking why her toilet was overflowing. I told her how I clogged it, used her plunger to unclog it, and thought I fixed the problem.

Hunter wanted to bring Derek and his brothers have brought girlfriends before so being supportive we said yes.

We also happen to live in rural Missouri though and I know since comming out Hunters had a bit of a rough go of it at school even being a wrestler. My parents town is also worse. We usually do fishing in the morning and then the boys go off on their own into town to do whatever and hang out. Yesterday  Hunter and Derek were already getting some weird looks from local boys for just holding hands while we were at the fishing spot.  Not wanting anything to happen before they went off on their own or with his brothers I pulled Hunter and Derek to the side and told them itd probably be a good idea if they were less affectionate while in town and to tone down. Hunter got this sad look on his face and before I got another word in he just says ok and drags Derek off.
 
As  far as I'm aware nothing happened while they were off by themselves. Except Hunter would barely talk to me when theu got back later in the day. Just kept looking down anytime we were having a conversation. It was still going like that this morning and I just had enough and I pulled aside alone and asked if someone said anything or did anything. He said everything was fine nothing he couldnt handle and so I asked why he was acting the way he was. He gets mad hot and just yells because I don't actually support and that I'm ashamed of him.

She keeps calling him even when we are on dates, just to ask for stuff or to tell him random stuff. She calls up to 4 times and nearly daily. She is pretty useless and keeps relying on him for nearly everything.  
I feel like my bf feels sorry for her and especially his niece, so his jumps to help them whenever she asks.

Yesterday, we were supposed to go on a bruch date but he asked me to go run an errand for her before heading to the café. I got pissed off and refused to go. He got mad at me and told me that I am mean for refusing and that I shouldn't mind since she is a single woman with a child and the errand would take half an hour.

I’m 30 with a family of my own. A 2 year old, one on the way, 2 dogs, and a whole husband 😂 IM BUSY. 
Anyways, I was raised by a single mom. Love her to death. She’s my best friend and I love her deeply. However, I have an older sister (in her 30s) who sometimes I feel as if she’s my younger sister. She’s never been able to keep a job, smokes all day long, very anti social, and jumps from one relationship to another. NO JUDGMENT from my end. I love and care for my sister but I wish she could grow up a little bit! She lives at home with my mom which my mom takes care of the bills, groceries, and she also pays for my sisters phone and car insurance. My mom works a physically challenging job & she’s almost 60. I WORRY FOR MY MOM! I’m a SAHM and I wish I could contribute financially. But I mean if we go out, I pay of course. I buy her random little presents just to show her I’m thinking about her. I randomly drop her off flowers. I do what I can to show my love for her. 
My sister has a new boyfriend, she has not introduced him to my mom but she has him in my mom’s house when my mom is at work. She makes him lunch (with the food my mom buys), and he even showers there sometimes. He rents a room somewhere but he’s usually over my mom’s house when she’s not there. Isn’t that disrespectful!? We all share locations with each other and my sister will randomly stop sharing locations with both my mom and I when she doesnt want us to know where she’s at. My mom worries and it breaks my heart how my mom at her age has to worry for her 30+ year old daughter as if she’s a teenager. I guess I’m just worried and feel bad for my mom. She sometimes vents to me about how sick and tired she is of my sister but for some reason she never confronts my sister or puts her foot down. What’s so wrong with asking my sister to pay for her own bills, her groceries, and to pay for some of the rent? What’s wrong with telling my sister to GET A JOB. She’s 32! I am planning on talking to my sister about this but I know she’s going to get defensive. It’s not what I want but she needs a wake up call. Right?

29,1c9sa4r,WIBTA if I decline a bridesmaid role because I can’t stand the other bridesmaid?,"For what it’s worth, I’m originally from a country that is currently at war.

Recently, my friend Laura asked me to be her bridesmaid. I wanted to accept because she is one of the first friends I made in America and I love her dearly.

My problem is that her family wants her stepsister in the wedding party. I don’t get along with her stepsister, haven’t been for years. For example, she doesn’t like how I broke my “no politics or news” rule for social media to post my thoughts about what happened in my country when I didn’t for any other political issue (which has nothing to do with my blogs, which are about crafting, dolls and being an immigrant).

The other thing is that whenever we are in the same room, she always wants to grill me on what is going on in my country and the war and how I feel about (insert something horrible that happened). It makes me extremely uncomfortable. When I tell her I don’t want to talk about it, she’s called me ignorant and other nasty things.

It’s gotten to the point where the stepsister is harassing me on my personal accounts. Like, I would see a concert and she would post how I feel enjoying myself when (atrocity) is happening.

I have started to avoid places where she will be at because no matter what I do, nothing seems to stop her.

Which leads me to now. Laura wants me to be a bridesmaid. But if I accept, I’m going to be standing with the stepsister, who is a bully. I don’t want to put myself in a position where my mental health will tank.

I told Laura my concerns and she was so sad, so disappointed. And it breaks my heart because this is a huge moment for her and I’m ruining it by not being there for her.

He hides it quite well: it often takes some digging to find his stash.  He’s also on medication where he shouldn’t be having much to begin with.

Just a couple months ago I went to pick some things up from my parents place (moved out earlier this year) and went to take things from under my old bed (he uses it now).  I found a massive stash of empty hard liquor bottles, and informed my parents (I didn’t want to involve myself, but I was worried for him).  This was not a surprise as this happens often where we find his stash.  No more than a week later after an initial confrontation with my parents and him, parents now buy him beer when they go out and say it’s fine if he drinks.  They even had a meeting with the psychiatrist and say it’s fine.  Which I can’t fathom.

He doesn’t do anything around the house except sleep and play video games mostly.  But everyone in the house keeps saying “he’s better now” but I’m aware of the cycle that continues, and I feel like the process of normalizing it is allowing him to devolve back into drinking again.

I also said he needs stop caring so much about what he looks like to other people because he looks absolutely fine, his clothes don’t look or fit weird and people aren’t caring that much.

He told me I should care MORE about what people think of me. (He’s always had a problem with the way I dress. He doesn’t like if I want to wear leggings, he thinks I dress boring. I’m not the girliest of girls but this is how I’ve always been…)
He did not take what I said very well and got pretty offended I guess. Then he made a comment about my black shirt and jeans and said i looked plain, to where I responded with “I ordered some new clothes they haven’t come in yet.” And he said he doesn’t want to go any where anymore.

So here I am laying in bed with my plain clothes. I cried a little but am wondering if I should even be crying. Is what I said mean? Or is he just upset that I called him out in a way? AITA?",0.0,0.0225075,0,1
34,1c9ripz,AITA for not buying my mother a bar of chocolate? ,"So I (17F) am a student doing my a levels but I also got my first ever part time job in McDonald’s. So I’m juggling my job and getting decent ish grades. 

I got my first pay check last week and most of it has gone on nothing productive, I shamefully spent about £40 on snacks over a few weeks and saved some and bought some things and borrowed my mum some. Every time I bought a bar of chocolate or sweets or something from a bakery, I bought her something. After work if I went to the shop I always ask if she wants me to get her a treat or something. I’ve offered to pay rent, pay for subscriptions we use, pay for my phone contract and she just denies it and says that she doesn’t want my money and that I should just save for our holiday and treat myself. 

I have £10 left till Thursday (payday)  but I need new shoes and headphones so I’m saving it incase my pay check doesn’t cover it. My shoes are too big too wear and my earphones cost £20 and are broke so I wanna splash out since I never had the chance to as a kid. I had like £1.95 left minus the £10 and was really craving some cookies from the corner shop for a some which literally cost £1. So I went to the shop and asked if she wanted anything and at first she said no, then she said yeah when I was about to leave. I came back and didn’t get her a bar of chocolate that she asked for since I was gonna get her a big one and possibly some flowers when I get paid and she didn’t specify what she wanted so idk what she likes or doesn’t like. She said that it’s okay and not to worry. 

We moved on but now she’s on the phone to her friend and called me selfish and tight and that she does so much for me and that she’s gonna start charging me for basic things such as turning on the shower or having dinner (she may be joking but idk). She also said that I need to stop thinking about myself and I probably bought them just for me because I know that she hates them. I told her that I’ll make it up to her or I’ll get my shoes on and buy her a bar right now (my hairs soaking wet and it’s 9pm but you gotta do what you gotta do). 

So AITA for not buying her something or should I spend my earned money on myself? Should I have bought something there and then or am I okay?

My gfs bday party was last week and I was supposed to be there as they wanted us to do this dance together as I’ve already been welcomed into her family and we are the ‘high school sweethearts’ and things like that.

Well on the day I was getting ready to drive to her house for the party my  bsf contacted me saying her grandma died and she really needs support. I told her I was on my way to my gfs house and she said she really needed me even if I showed up for 5 mins. I said okay and arrived at her house.

Her parents were still working so me and her had the house to our selves. I mainly just hugged and cuddled with her as she cried. After a while my gf blew up my phone saying I was late and that her parents were expecting me. I told her I’ll be there shortly.

I tried to leave but my bsf kept telling me she didn’t want me to leave and that she needed support and she was in pain. I didn’t want to leave her and she did something bad to herself. So I stayed longer than I was supposed too. I put the phone on do not disturb as I didn’t want to see any messages from my gf.

It was a little later when her mom entered the house and she saw the mess her daughter was in and thanked me for staying by her side I felt proud of myself and said goodbye to her and left calling my gf. She answered the phone crying saying how her bday was ruined and why didn’t I come. 

I explained where I was at and she understood but I could tell by the sadness in her voice she was still upset about it. Anyways things haven’t really been the same after that. When we hang out she’s smiling with me and stuff but I can tell the spark isn’t there anymore.

36,1c9r1to,AITA for not giving more money to the tab? ,"I went out with a large group of friends to a sports bar this weekend. We didn’t think to ask for separate checks until we were a couple of drinks in and by that point, we didn’t want to be a bother and agreed we’d sort it out at the end. At that point, I started writing down my drinks/food in the notes app on my phone so I could keep track of what I owed.

As the night went on, some of our group got pretty wasted. One of our friends, Jane, nearly got thrown out of the place so we were quickly settling up the tab. Another friend, Courtney, said she’d pay for it and we’d all give her what we owed. I quickly tallied up what I did and gave her the cash, along with some for the tip. After everyone had either Venmo’d or given her cash, the tab was still short. Courtney showed that the bill was still short. Finally, she did the math and said “Okay, everyone send me $20 and we’ll be fine”. Which, if we were splitting the bill evenly along would’ve been the right amount. But we had all agreed to pay for our own stuff. I said I already paid my portion and I wasn’t going to pay more and everyone needed to go over the tab again and make sure they had covered their respective drinks and food. Courtney said we needed to be quick because we were close to being kicked out due to Jane. I said I’d take Jane outside but I wasn’t giving more money.

I did just that and called for our Uber. Not long after, everyone else came out. Courtney was pissed because our waitress got fed up with how rowdy some of our group was and told her to figure this out later because they needed to go. She said that by me refusing to pay the tab, I “messed everything up”.  I didn’t want to discuss it further. I left with Jane and another friend in an Uber.

Next morning, I was told they still split the tab, just among the rest of them. But I was told that I made things difficult and “it’s just $20”. I was also told I made a stressful time more so by “picking a fight” when we really needed to get out of there.

I wanna make it clear that I do not like them in that way at all and when i think about i don't want them to like me in that way either but for some reason recently i've started to react in ways that suggest my subconcious thinks otherwise.

It started a few weeks ago when i noticed i started to feel a little happy whenever al did or said something positive to or about me, i.e when he stayed a little after everyone left to talk to me for about another half an hour or defended me against a little harsh joke my other friends were making. I also noticed i would get a little sad or mardy whenever something happened that would suggest he doesn't like me in that way. 

This has then escalated the past couple weeks to where i always want him to sit next to me and get annoyed when i cant, or sad if he wont be there at an event. And then even more recently ive found myself subconciously doing things i would otherwise consider flirty like shoulder touches or really intently listening when he talks (usually i like to have at least 50% share of a conversation. All these behaviours happen without me thinking about them and i only usually realise after the fact that theyve happened.

Again i dont have feelings for him and definitley dont want to lead him on (although thankfully due to history i think theres probably about a 0% chance of that happening) and wouldn't really do any of this if i were thinking about it. I am trying to make an effort to stop all this and thought since it wasnt anything big and all mostly in my head that it didnt really matter and i definitley dont think hes picked up on any of it.

41,1c9q4iu,AITA for dropping off a birthday card to an ex’s house?,"A bit hurt and looking for more perspectives on a recent event until I can talk about it with my therapist and some close friends.

I dated a gal 2 years ago. I ended up signing a lease right down the street from her, but things between us ended right before I moved in— I wasn’t ready for the relationship, and it ended sourly.

A year after we broke up, I left a generic birthday card wishing her well at her door and some stuff of hers I still had. 

Now 2 years after we broke up I left another birthday card, but I also included a graphic t shirt that I just thought she’d find funny and put in a note about reaching out if she’d like to catch up. My intention of this was to genuinely wish her well and open the door for either an amicable end so things aren’t on some dramatic Taylor swift ex boyfriend song type terms and closure for both of us or possibly friendship in the distant future. This was going to be the final reach out, because I didn’t want this to be a pattern and go into weird territory, but it appears that I am already there! 

She ended up returning the card to my doorstep and wrote in big sharpie all over it. “YOU MAKE ME UNCOMFY. NO! LEAVE ME ALONE. RESPECT MY BOUNDARIES DO NOT COME TO MY HOUSE EVER AGAIN”

Message received, she wants nothing to do with me and I can understand that. But does she really think I’m a creep? That’s the part that I am absolutely flabbergasted by. Maybe I wasn’t clear enough about my intentions? Maybe no matter my intentions, the action is still a man coming to a woman’s house uninvited? 

When we broke up, she talked about possibly being friends in the future if we just went no contact for a while, so boom— I lost her phone number and in two years the only contact we’ve had is that generic birthday card I left her. I’ve seen her at the grocery store a couple times and I didn’t approach because I didn’t know where we were at and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. 

This is a very painful and valuable lesson for me about the importance of ending on amicable and clear terms, because it appears that I’ll have to live with the fact that someone I cared deeply about in the past, is uncomfortable by my actions and thinks I’m a creep!

42,1c9pttf,AITA for not respecting boundaries?,"Some have commented on my previously posted ask, but it was then mod-removed.  I hope I have corrected the infraction, added a bit more info, and still welcome input.  We have never been asked to babysit (7 & 5) year old grandkids, but they had an emergency - the 7 year old has autistic behavioural issues & was dismissed from school for two days. We dropped everything to help babysit, so both parents could continue work days.

We arrived and the front door wouldn't open due to debris, and the house was in a high state of disarray; trash strewn, no clear surface, full sink of dirty dishes with no clean kitchen surface, two couches, one couch full of debris, the other with a large split seam, clothes stewn, bathroom floor littered with bathroom trash incl. fem. hygiene remnants (no bin). 

I'm on the far other end of that scale in my practices, but it's how they operate.  We've been told their home as a safe and calming place for him after school, with other kids moving around doing things, teachers giving instructions, movement outside that might catch his attention, etc. After school/work it's unwind/chill time.  Tidying/vacuuming/cleaning commotion at home is distracting & an irritation for everyone after school/work, so they do it on weekends since they both work.  What I saw on a Wednesday was not created after a ""weekend clean"".

Day 1 I tidied a bit, though I've been told in the past not to as it crosses a boundary they aren't comfortable with -- tossed trash, cleared a coffee table surface, did the dishes and cleaned a counter surface, tossed bathroom trash, and freed the front door. As a caregiver, felt I needed basic function.

Day 2 I mentioned a few safety issues, (mostly the front door emergency exit/access) and asked to organize the inaccessible playroom due to excessive toys and was told not to. I was told to just watch, entertain, or go for a walk. Unprepared to walk in a snowstorm I just sat and watched. Later we were told we wouldn't be asked to help again since we seemed so bothered and we crossed boundaries. Other family visited briefly (older generation) and one cried and the other was appalled over the home's state.

Previous deleted post commenters asked why I didn't to to the library, ice cream trip , my house (I'm an hour away) etc., but without a car seat, and a history of not staying at the table for meals/restaurants disturbing others, I don't want that issue.

43,1c9psx9,AITA for using the word date when being with my son?,"I can’t even believe I’m asking this, but it shows how messed up people are.

I have an 10 year old son that I love more than anything. He is really the light of my life, and the best thing to happen to me, even though he was an accident. He’s just the cutest and most precious thing in the world.

I liked to spend time alone with my son, and I take him to restaurants, movies, etc, alone, like most parents do. His dad passed away, but I do have a boyfriend I could take with me but I’d prefer for it to just be us two.

I call these outings dates. I just think it’s cute. I usually post on instagram or TikTok that I’m going on a date with my son, and I describe what we’re doing.


It’s not that serious, I like to joke we’ve been dating since he’s been a baby, but obviously it’s just being a little silly. My kid thinks nothing of it and is super excited to go on a “date” aka spend time with me.

The thing is my friends and my bf find it weird. My bf has made a few passive aggressive comments about it, saying dates are a romantic thing, but he dropped it when I got angry at him. But now my friends who I met through my son’s school said they thought it was weird I talk about my son like that. 

We were getting lunch and I was telling her about the date my son and I went on and she had wrinkled her nose. She said it makes her uncomfortable hearing me describe it as a date. I said there was nothing uncomfortable about it. He’s only 10, he’s a boy. 

She said do you plan on stopping? I said no because I think it’s cute and it’s family tradition. She said that was weird and I said she was judgmental and it was weird for her to be judging me and my family. Why can’t I call it a date? It makes it seem more special than just hanging around my son. We had a bit of a fight over it.

I think she’s being judgmental and looking down on me because I’m not married and she is. AITA?",Asshole,2024-04-21,"AITA for using the word date when being with my son? I can’t even believe I’m asking this, but it shows how messed up people are.

so its the day of the supposed interview and she said it had to be on zoom, which im not very comfortable with, i was still down to help her out but i had to ask her first why couldn’t it be thru chat/written out, she replied to me super rudely saying something along the lines of “its a thesis cmon i told you yesterday to help me, it’s not like i can say ‘she texted this to me instead of having a recording🙄just tell me if u can’t so i can ask someone else” i was like ok.. to me i asked a simple question about how it was gonna go, and mind you my first language is spanish so it was way more rude in spanish than it sounds, i just don’t know how to translate properly. 

anyways, i told her i was just asking a question and she didn’t need to be rude about it, i understood what she said and was still willing to help, then she started saying im not an empathic person bc i don’t care that she’s stressed out about her paper (which she has had months to do and hasn’t, today is the last day) and that i could’ve just helped her out instead of asking questions so many times (i asked ONCE) and that she’s tired of me not helping her out w stuff. i asked her what stuff?? she said she meant just with her thesis stuff. then, she told me someone else would’ve just told her ok let’s do it, but idc about other people, we’ve been friends for so long and she knows how i am, so idk why we talking about what other people would do..

 i just asked her to apologize for being rude to me when i was willing to help even when i don’t like doing zooms/being recorded and then watched by other people and she says “sorry but…” 
after the way she talked to me and made me feel bad for asking a simple question i told her that i didn’t want to do it before but would do it for her and to help her out, and then she was rude to me, she can imagine i don’t want to do it at all anymore.

49,1c9oqvv,AITA for having an expensive baby shower? ,"When I found out I was pregnant back in March 2023, my best friend of nearly 20 years immediately offered to throw my baby shower. I hesitated accepting at first, though, because I had some specific things I wanted. I had a baby back in 2015 and my mom hosted that shower. It was almost a total nightmare. I simply wanted to avoid some of the issues that arose then. 

I made sure my friend, who I will refer to as Alexis was okay with the fact that I wanted the shower to be at a venue that could handle more than 20 people (so not at a person's house). I also wanted a few of my other friends to be involved in the planning because they had also offered to throw a shower as well. One of them was Jemma, who wanted to make the cake. I told her to accept their help because I knew it would be costly to do everything herself. She agreed and was super excited. 

She started a group text with my friends who offered to pay for food, decorations, and even chip in for the cost of the venue, which ended up being a room at a winery. It cost $180 for the day.

The shower happened in October, and it was beautiful.  Everything went really well and went beyond my expectations.  I was emotional from how beautiful it was. There were platters from Sam's Club of sandwiches, sangria, centerpieces and cute games. At the end of the shower when we were cleaning up, I see Alexis talking to Jemma privately. Alexis handed Jemma an envelope, presumably money to pay for the cake, when I thought that Jemma did it all as a gift/contribution to the shower. 

 In talking with one of my friends in the group chat, they finally revealed that Alexis never responded to anyone when they offered to chip in, except for Jemma and another friend who made a balloon arch. My husband and I felt terrible and wanted to try to give her some money as a gift.  We never wanted her to foot the bill for the entire shower.

This had an impact on my self perception and identity, and I grew up to be insecure about being Indian, something I still struggle with.

Over the years, I would tell them that these racists statements make me feel hurt and out of place, and that they should simply refrain from saying them. Instead of backing down and cutting out the habit, they insisted I was ""too sensitive"" and that they did not mean anything against me. Realizing that speaking up had no effect, I decided my only choice was to laugh along with their ""jokes"" and statements. But it turns out even that would eventually not spare me of direct humiliation.

Yesterday, my sister came over for a visit. More than once (at least three or four times), she would say unsolicited rude things about Indians (ex. ""she's really pretty for an Indian""), and my mother would begin to laugh, so I would try to laugh too. In response to my evidently uncomfortable laughter, my mom would point it out, laughing ""look, she's laughing so uncomfortably! She was genuinely laughing before, but when you said \_\_, she grew uncomfortable, haha!"" This made me feel isolated among my own mother and sister. I did not feel like making a big deal out of it at the moments they happened because I did not want to ruin my sister's stay or create a bad atmosphere.

This morning, I woke up in tears because of how unlikeable I felt, remembering yesterday's recurring incidents. I decided to confront my mother and tell her how I feel. I will admit, I probably should have calmed down and started the conversation more maturely, but my mom did not respond nicely either. I explained that I did not like how she appeared to find joy in my visible discomfort, pointing out that if they are going to insist on making racist comments, they can at least leave me alone if I am trying to laugh along with them since they won't listen to me beg them to simply cut it out. Her claim was that in pointing out my discomfort, she actually aimed to make me feel more included and not isolated, which did not make any sense to me because it seemed to me like she actually found my discomfort amusing and an object of mocking. I was called ""sensitive"" once again. My dad came forward and said that while my mom and sister probably should refrain from saying things that make me uncomfortable, I still overreacted.

It’s a small village so everyone knows everyone. My uncle is a combat veteran and got a TBI in Iraq.

Yesterday it was me, my mom, my sister, and my uncle. I go up to the counter, there’s some guys eating breakfast there, whatever, and I pay the bill. My guy hands me back too much change, because he always tries to veteran discount us on every meal and I insist he takes it as a tip at least.

Vietnam shrugs and says “it’s your money if you want to loose it.”



I was mildly annoyed at this point, so I said “my uncle is a veteran.”

53,1c9npxv,AITA for not telling my parent about my relationship?,"I (early 20sF) have been with my boyfriend (mid 20sM) for about a year. We are currently living together, having just moved in with each other about 6 months ago. We have known each other and been friends since we were kids.

Important to note for context: my parents have always been weird about me dating. All throughout high school, I was not allowed to date or even have any phone numbers of any boys. Any time I expressed interest in dating someone, even up until I was 20, I was told I could not be with them for whatever reason.

So last year, my boyfriend and I made some big steps in our relationship. I told a few other close, less judgemental and easier to approach family members about us. We had dinner a few times and things were going very well. However, at one point, one of my family members mentioned my boyfriend in conversation and my father found out. At first, he seemed happy for me because he has known my boyfriend for some time while we were just friends and said he was a good guy, but a few days later his opinion changed completely. He called me and told me that he wanted nothing to do with me or my boyfriend.

I was distraught. It was a really rough time in my life and my depression reached an all time high.

A few months later, we had a bit of a reconciliation, but there’s been an understanding that I cannot talk about my boyfriend and I cannot ever bring him over. Even to this day, despite my living with him and us being very serious, even making plans for the future, I cannot say anything related to my relationship. It’s becoming exhausting, especially because I can’t bring my boyfriend to family occasions he might be attending or I know there will be a scene.

I found out from my brother that my father is upset that he wasn’t the first one I told. I had apologized and explained I was worried to tell him given the history as mentioned above and while he originally was receptive, it’s like he’s completely disregarding that entire conversation now. I don’t know what to do, and I’ve been having a weird struggle where I feel like I don’t owe him to tell him every detail of my dating life, but I feel guilty because it has so clearly hurt him. I just want to see some other perspectives.

So, am I the asshole for not telling him first? Am I an asshole for a different reason I haven’t even considered?

My(43f) oldest daughter(24f) and sil (23m) have 2 young children both under 3 with another on the way. 
They recently had a fire safety inspection on their rented property which resulted in the landlord giving written instructions that they would be carrying out monthly inspections due to the conditions in which they were living.

 It all came to a head last week when I finally managed to see for myself how bad things had gotten. To say I was disgusted and ashamed is an understatement. But we rolled our sleeves up and we got on with making the property as good as we could in 48 hrs before the initial return visit of the landlord. The property is still far from an acceptable standard, especially with young children living there but the landlord was satisfied with the progress that has been made and is planning to return next month. There is sill a lot to do and it's going to be heavy going but we can take it at a steadier pace now.

 So imagine my surprise when I get a message asking me to babysit tomorrow so that she can go get her nails fixed,  because she broke one of her gels whilst cleaning. I was flabbergasted,  I love my grandchildren and i enjoy looking after them when she has appointments etc but I just spent 2 days emptying filthy rubbish, building furniture,  cleaning, and making her home a safe place for them all to live in and we still have a list of jobs to be getting on with but she wants to pay a professional to redo her gels because she doesn't want to be walking around with broken nails. Apparently she made the appointment weeks ago and if she cancels with such short notice she will still have to pay so she's literally backed me into a corner so that if i don't babysit it will cost her more money.

 I lost it and told her that this is the last time i will look after her children for anything other than essential appointments and that if she wants to waste her time and money on that nonsense then she can do it when her husband is around to look after his children i explained that right now her appearance is the very bottom of my priorities and as a stay at home mum with a house in that state it shouldn't even be on her list of priorities rn. I told her she needs to grow up, get her priorities straight and start putting her kids first.

 My husband (her dad) says I went too far and that it will be my fault if we lose contact with our grandchildren. I told him that if they don't all wake up the kids will be heading into care and then none of us will have contact so please tell me AITA?


Update:

She has cancelled the nail appointment and is currently not talking to me, she is still messaging her dad though so I'm not overly concerned by that atm

I have explained to my husband that my priority is the safety of my grandchildren and whether he likes it or not I will always do what I believe to be in their best interests and whatever it takes to ensure that safety.  Even if that means reporting suspected neglect. 

He is not happy about it due to his own family history but accepts that if we do nothing then we are complicit and they deserve better than that. 

A couple of people have mentioned discussing the situation with sil family, unfortunately his parents have a very low opinion of me and my husband ( as we were young parents) and even less respect for our opinions, on the few occasions that I have tried to raise concerns with them it has not gone well and I feel it likely that any concerns I try to raise with them now will fall on deaf ears.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,"AITA for telling my daughter to grow up and get her priorities straight

 My husband (her dad) says I went too far and that it will be my fault if we lose contact with our grandchildren. I told him that if they don't all wake up the kids will be heading into care and then none of us will have contact so please tell me AITA?


Update:

She has cancelled the nail appointment and is currently not talking to me, she is still messaging her dad though so I'm not overly concerned by that atm

I have explained to my husband that my priority is the safety of my grandchildren and whether he likes it or not I will always do what I believe to be in their best interests and whatever it takes to ensure that safety.  Even if that means reporting suspected neglect. 

He is not happy about it due to his own family history but accepts that if we do nothing then we are complicit and they deserve better than that. 

A couple of people have mentioned discussing the situation with sil family, unfortunately his parents have a very low opinion of me and my husband ( as we were young parents) and even less respect for our opinions, on the few occasions that I have tried to raise concerns with them it has not gone well and I feel it likely that any concerns I try to raise with them now will fall on deaf ears.",0.0,0.07367347,0,1
59,1c9m7dm,"AITA for refusing to pay for half of my ex-girlfriend’s flight that she can’t use because we broke up, and now possibly not even mine?","My girlfriend (F24) and I (M25) broke up about two weeks ago. It was more her call than mine, but we both knew things weren’t going well for a while. So, I was sad but not surprised. We ended things amicably and said we’d still be friends, whatever that means. 

Anyway, we did the exchange of things in each other’s apartment a couple days after the break up and then didn’t talk again until two days ago when she texted me. We had been planning to go on a trip to the Canary Islands this year. The plane tickets were about $800 a piece and the AirBnb was like $1600, so we decided I’d just pay for the AirBnb and she’d pay for the flights. 

The flights were non-refundable and we’re already past the date that I’d get any meaningful refund from the AirBnb, so I decided I’d just get a friend to split the AirBnb and go anyway. 

I had been planning on telling my ex that I’d pay her for my ticket so she didn’t lose the money, but she texted me about it first. On Friday, she offered to pay me for the AirBnb minus the cost of my plane ticket, because she was still interested in going with a friend. I told her that I was actually planning on going with a friend, and I was going to pay her for my ticket and still go. 

She said OK, but I actually needed to pay her for my ticket and half of the cost of hers because she can’t use it now. Basically, she says that she agreed to buy two plane tickets under the understanding that we would both go to on the trip. And I agreed to pay for an AirBnb under the same understanding. But since that’s not happening, we should evenly share the lost costs. Since I’m still using the room and my ticket, the only lost cost is her $800 ticket. And we should each bear $400 from that. 

I told her that I didn’t think that’s fair at all. First of all, it was her idea to break up. So the reason we aren’t going is on her. Second, there’s no reason why she can’t use her ticket. She should just get an airbnb and still go with her friend. I even said I’d sit in her friend’s seat and let her friend in my seat so they can sit together. Whether or not she uses her ticket is on her, and she bears any cost of that. 

She said she didn’t want to go at the same time as me and also the good AirBnbs are taken for that time. Anyway, we went back and forth and she even threatened to cancel the tickets even though she can’t get any money back. So I said, “You know what, go ahead cancel them, get whatever refund you can. I’ll just buy my own ticket and not pay you back anything.” She said, “I’m not gonna talk to you if you’re being a dick. Let’s talk about this later when you can be mature.” 

That’s where it is right now. My friends are divided. Most say I should at least pay her for my ticket. Which I’m willing to do if she doesn’t cancel it!

61,1c9lyt3,AITA for asking the person I took over a lease from to pay 1/3 of the cleaning fee,"Hi! I (22f) moved into an apartment with a roommate who I met on facebook (26f) by taking over the old roommate’s (24f) lease. There was 9 months left on the lease when I took over and they had already lived there for over year together before I moved in. 

Fast forward and our lease is ending at the end of this month. My current roommate and I have decided to move out and go our separate ways. We live in a big apartment complex so they have a high standard of cleaning before management rents the apartment again. So we were informed there’s basically no avoiding the $360 cleaning fee. 

I asked if we could split the cleaning fee 3 ways between me, current roommate, and previous roomate. These two people are close friends so the current roommate was quick to say that it didn’t make sense for old roommate to pay that much because she “didn’t hang anything on the walls” and “cleaned my room before I moved in.” 

My thought was she definitely didn’t deep clean the apartment before I moved in and she lived there longer than I did. There is also some minor damage that she caused (carpet stain, nail holes but only a few). I was firm on splitting 3 ways which they were not happy about and we will definitely be ending this lease on bad terms. 

AITA for thinking someone who lived in an apartment for an over a year should split the cleaning fee? Just because she doesn’t live there currently does that excuse the year she lived there previous to me?

As he was studying he couldn't afford rent in the city. So we came to an agreement where he'd stay with me for free in exchange he'd do the cooking, cleaning, and general house-management. It was honestly great.

After he finished studying and got a good job, I had gotten used to having my lunch ready in the fridge in the morning, always having a spotless house, never having to check if we were running out of toilet paper. Neither of us saw any reason to change the arrangement.

I am starting to get serious with my girlfriend (26f) of 2-years and we had a discussion about what we want from a relationship/when, our finances, ect., in this conversation she found out my roommate pays no rent.

I tried to explain that a personal cook, cleaner, ect. would cost way more than rent and I was getting a great deal out of this. She thinks I should charge rent and ""be a grown up and manage my own life"".

63,1c9lko8,AITA for telling my friend that he should give his dog more attention? ,"My friend, ""K,"" has an adorable Aussie Shepherd named Aus, who's well-trained and well-loved. He also has another small dog named “Rex” who is best buds with Aus. 

Lately, Aus has shown mild aggression, worrying K. Despite not taking Aus to the vet yet, K discussed Aus's behavior with a vet, who mentioned a potential tumor and suggested euthanasia due to the expense. K opted against it, hoping to find a compassionate family for Aus, who could afford treatment and handle the aggression with patience and understanding.

One potential adopter returned Aus after leaving him in a hot car, triggering aggression (this guy was an ass).

Despite concerns, K adopted a new puppy, Babe, to keep Rex company once Aus is gone. Aus now stays in a cage due to his aggression (K was going to buy a muzzle to have him roam around and he still takes him on walks), while Babe now sleeps with K in his bed. 

So here’s where I wonder if I’m the AH. I sent this to K after he was fan girling over his new puppy Babe:

“I think you need to take Aus to the vet and confirm what it is that he has. If it really is a brain tumor, that sweet boy is probably in so much pain. And the aggression is just a way of him letting out pain? Idk.

 I get you’re super happy rn about Babe, it’s wonderful you saved her from the shelter, but just don’t get blind sided by the joy you’re feeling rn and the pretty puppy cuddling with you. 

Aus really needs you right now, he needs your full attention yk. I know we all process things differently and I support you doing what’s best for you. But Aus is still there. If he has that tumor, he’s in so much pain I’m sure. Maybe the vet could help you find resources to re-home him? Or maybe even the shelter you got Babe at might have some resources/connections.” 

K got so pissed off at me for saying this. He sent a long paragraph but here’s the short version :

“Dude, being happy about Babe doesn't mean I'm neglecting Aus. I've been trying to help him – contacted the vet, reached out to shelters and resources. No one wants to help, and the vet suggested putting him down due to a potential brain tumor. His aggression comes out of nowhere, not triggered by pain. I've done everything I can, but it's frustrating when you assume otherwise. I’m pretty pissed off right now. Goodnight.”

I wished him well and told him I hope everything goes the way he plans, but to take care and that I hope Aus gets a chance at a family. I unfriended him after that because I can’t stand the way he talks to me when he doesn’t hear what he wants.

65,1c9la6y,AITA for not wanting to lend my brother money?,"I (25f) have a 28 year old brother. He used to have a proper job with an amazing company a couple years back. He had a nice car and did well for himself. Unfortunately, he got himself into some credit card debt but it wasn’t a huge amount so he was able to manage it on his own.

 He met his wife at this company and they both ended up quitting that job a year later due to its toxic environment. My brother ended up losing his car too due to a crash. Shortly after, his wife got a really good job with a higher salary while my brother started a zero hours delivery job. 

They both lived at home with me, my sister and my parents. His wife started arguing with my mum so they moved out a few months after she got that really good job. They were able to manage the rent etc and everything was going well for them. Until his wife started having mental breakdowns due to the job and decided to quit. We live in the UK so she started receiving benefits instead. Benefits were nowhere near what she used to earn at her job and my brother was still at this zero hours delivery job so things became quite financially tough for them. 

At the end of the day, he is my brother and I care for him. I’m very empathetic towards my loved ones so whenever he would ask for money, I would always give it to him. He always would say that he would pay me back. He started borrowing from my dad, sister and mum. Basically, all of us. We did say move back home if you can’t afford it but I don’t think his wife wants to. 

It started off with me borrowing my brother £20 here and there where he would pay me back once he would get paid. Then he would say he can’t pay me back this time and ask for more on top of what he already owed me. This made the total of what my brother owed me build up. 

He chose to move out. He chose to quit his job. He chose to max out credit cards knowing it could affect him in the long run. It just seems like we (our family) have to pay for his mistakes now. He comes over and takes food and toiletries. We just help him out so much and he continues to take and barely gives back. I’m writing this post after reading his text today asking for money, again. I work a job which I do not enjoy. So I really appreciate every little penny I have. I wish he understood that. 

Also, when his wife gets paid and he has just been paid too, it’ll be radio silence from both of them for over a week. Then when they’ve spent all their money, he starts to visit more often and starts asking for money again. 

I really wouldn’t mind if he paid it back in a timely manner but I just feel like he is taking advantage of me now. I also end up giving him the money because I know if I don’t, he would end up asking my dad for it which I also hate!!!

67,1c9l6un,AITA For Not Trading Paddle Boards Back?,"My friend’s (T) sister (J) and I traded paddle boards over a year back. I liked that J had a bigger and wider board because I’m not the greatest with balance and length/width provides stability. J liked my board because it was smaller than hers and she is a small person so it would be easier for her to handle/maneuver. We said we could trade back if things didn’t work out so I felt ok with the arrangement.

 Everything seemed great initially, however, 4-6 months after we traded I get a text from my friend stating her sister wants to trade back. J is now saying the board is too small for her daughter and her to ride on. I’m bummed of course, but am willing to trade back despite the length of time that had passed because J and I never set an amount of time that we could say we wanted to trade back. Nothing further is said about trading the boards and nothing is set up to actually trade them back.

 Another year has passed (so 1.5 years since we traded) and J is now asking T for the board back again. I told T to give J my contact information so we can discuss the issue and set up a trade back. J texts me and says my old board isn’t inflating properly and then states she wants her old board back so her and her daughter can fit on it. I say I want to see my old board and make sure it’s in working condition before we trade back, seeing as the board was perfect when I gave it to her, she’s saying its now not inflating properly, and it’s been over 1.5 years since we initially traded. 

J got really aggressive, cursing at me, saying this is holding her old board hostage and she doesn’t need to “put on a dog and pony show” because she sent me a picture of the tip of my old board “working” on the water. This is suspicious to me because, not only did J explicitly state that the board wasn’t inflating properly now, a different picture J sent T shows the board looking deflated and creased (which wasn’t an issue when we traded or when she first said she wanted her old board back a year ago).

 I told her I don’t feel comfortable with that arrangement, I need to see my old board first. She says she lives really far away (like an hour I believe) and she just wants T to take her old board, and that she’ll give T my old board once she has her old one back. I said again that I am more than willing to trade back boards, I just want to see my old one first and make sure it holds air properly and is in working condition before we trade. She didn’t respond, with her last message saying karma will “take care of you.” I feel like I might be the asshole because I did say we could trade back if we didn’t like the boards, but I feel like the circumstances are different now.

68,1c9l4ss,AITA for reporting the apartment manager to my landlord company ,"I live in a small one bedroom apartment that’s on the older side and they do not allow pets of ANY kind. I was fine with this rule and understood why when I first moved in. Early this year my apartment complex was bought out by a management company and they still enforced the “No pets” policy, which again is understandable. 

The onsite manager just moved in, and to my surprise they have TWO small dogs. Normally I wouldn’t have been too upset because emotional/service animals are acceptable but I recently learned that neither managers dogs are emotional or service animals. He leaves them outside for majority of the day and all they do is bark nonstop for hours and hours. I got a lease renewal two days ago and I was reading the no pet policy. Tenants are not allowed any kind of pet (not even fish or reptiles) and if a pet is found in your home you are required to pay a $700 fee and will be kicked out. After reading this I was pretty frustrated with the onsite manager and lack of responsibility for his two dogs that bark all day. So I sent in a formal complaint against him.

I don’t think it’s fair at all, that paying tenants cannot have any kind of pet whatsoever but the manager is allowed to have two animals and leave them outside ALL day. 

I ended up getting some opinions from some friends and some of them think I was an asshole for reporting the manager. I personally don’t think I’m in the wrong here because in what world is it okay for the manager to have pets but no one else is allowed? 

Am I the asshole in this situation?

69,1c9knk8,WIBTA for complaining about my upstair’s neighbour’s kid?,"Last year, I moved into a ground floor flat in the outskirts of my town. I wanted to live further out due to wanting some peace and quiet after living in the town centre for so long. Sadly, I wasn’t allowed that pleasure for very long.

My upstairs neighbour is by no means the quietest person to live beneath, but it’s manageable.

On weekends, he has his kid come to visit. When I say kid, I mean a preteen/young teenage boy. I understand that his kid has autism, and I believe he is non-verbal too. I get it must be difficult for him, and I understand it is probably stressful for my neighbour at times too. But every single weekend, from morning til night, all I can hear is this kid running around upstairs (which makes my ceiling shake), accompanied by a guttural screaming and wailing. All day. I can hear it over music, TV, anything I try to drown it out with. 

It doesn’t seem like my neighbour does anything to discourage this, as if anything it’s actually been getting worse. The only intervention I’ve heard is my neighbour screeching at his kid to “shut the fuck up” occasionally, or when I hear the kid’s antics past 11pm then it’s accompanied by my neighbour shouting “go to fucking bed” at the top of his voice. 

The noise is now at the point that it’s affecting my mental health badly. It’s relentless, and I can’t focus on anything other than the sound of this kid stomping and screaming.

70,1c9jrn8,AITA for wanting to use 2 carrots to make myself juice?,"My parents bought an expensive juice maker a few days ago for my father. They think drinking fresh juice will cure him of skin cancer (not the deadly kind). 

I have been helping my father with the juicer since a few days ago, helping him figure it out etc. Today, my parents decided to make carrot juice. I get up and see my mom using a dangerous grater to cut the carrots. I make a comment saying that it's dangerous and unnecessary, because she might cut her finger off for no reason. Carrots do not need to be grated into small chunks for juice.

My mom gets mad at me, starts yelling at me and basically telling my dad and I to do it ourselves. So, I end up doing just that. I start making carrot juice, and I ask if I can take two carrots to try some juice. Both of my parents start yelling at me for ""butting in"" and my mom makes a comment that my father is making it for himself (he's just making batches to freeze them for later), how I should've just kept playing on my console etc.

That shocked me. I was asking for two carrots, not a litre of juice. I felt offended that they were having such a large reaction and yelling at me over measly 2 carrots. So, I walk out of the kitchen and sit in the living room. My dad then calls me to help him pour the juice in the bags and I say no. He also left me 1 carrot to ""make myself juice"" which approximately 10 drops because they barely yield anything. I tell him that I won't help him, that I'm not making myself juice and my parents call me dramatic and petty.

71,1c9jpq4,AITA for getting my girlfriend Taylor Swift albums for her birthday.,"My girlfriend is a huge Taylor Swift fan and we have been financially struggling over the past few months as I lost my job and have been looking for a new one.

As a result we have had to cut down on a lot of expenses. That means no concerts, eating out and cutting most subscription services including Spotify.

My girlfriend likes going to Taylor Swift concerns when she can and is completely obsessed with Taylor Swift. She says her songs have moral values and empower women and says buying her albums and concert tickets is a way to help her make the world a better place for women.

Even when we had Spotify she would buy the albums. Some time ago, she bought old Albums she already owned.

I know she was bummed out about not being able to buy the latest Album and for myself I already have a self hosted server on which I keep all my music and movies and can stream it from everywhere over a vpn.

I downloaded all Taylor Swift songs including the latest album and put in on there and set up her phones and computers to access them as a birthday present for her.

However instead of being happy, she got upset and called me an AH and that she would not listen to pirated Taylor Swift music. Even though it is not really piracy except for the latest album as she already owns a copy. She has watched movies in a similar way before on our TV from my server and had no problem with it before.

My best friend (30F, let’s call her H) and I (29F) have been friends for 20 years and have lived together for the past 5 years. We’ve both been working on our mental health and physical health, her with her alcohol use and me with my shitty relationships with men. She was sober for about 2 weeks and started to slowly drink liquor again which means she started having strange behavior again, like saying mean things about me, my family, and my past relationships with men. I didn’t react because her sobriety journey is her own and I have learned to be less reactive or else it eggs her on even more. 

A day ago, her behavior started to be even more strange. She brings up the guy she’s starting a relationship with and, as a best friend, I ask her questions about him, what he does, where he lives, how he looks. She doesn’t share any of that with me and says she likes to keep things private. So I respect that and don’t push it. Later that day, she starts to call me a liar and manipulative. I’m beyond confused about what she means. She says, “i thought you were working on your mental health and your relationships with men, but you’re doing the same thing again.” 

Turns out she has looked through my text messages with a guy I had previous relations with. These were intimate texts, with photos, videos, and pretty much nsfw. Some back story to this guy (let’s call him R): I had a causal, mostly sexual relationship with R during a depressive state in my life 2 years ago, so it messed with my mental health heavily. I swore I’d never see him again, but as a bored and horny young woman  I started to talk to him sporadically over the past few weeks. 

H has a habit of looking through my texts for some reason. I can never comprehend why. Anyways, when I called her out on snooping and said that I didn’t tell her because it was private, she says that I’ve been lying to her and my mental health hasn’t been improving. I justify myself by saying that I have been improving and that I’m not actually gonna let this guy back in my life and that texts are harmless.

 H throws some slow blows about my depressive state 2 years ago, so I bring up how she’s relapsed and falling back into her old drinking habits. H gets defensive and says I’m an asshole best friend and that my lying is the reason she drinks. I called H a hypocrite because I was just being private about R, just as she was being private about her guy. 

So aita for calling out her drinking habits again and calling H a hypocrite? Was I lying or just being private like she was? Let me know if I need to clarify anything.

Okay, so step by step, we're playing over Discord, and one player, D, gets compelled to attack the closest ally.  That's K, so he moves, attacks, and scores like a 20+ on the attack role.  He seems excited and checks to make sure it hits; it does.  Rolls damage, gets max, like 20+ again.  That hurts but K can take it.  D then goes into his description of the attack and what he says, his character is attacking because he's magically been enraged.  We don't really hear it because App speaks up at then.  Most can't understand two people talking at once so, but the GM explains that App casts Silvery Barbs to make him re-roll.  D rerolls and misses by like 1.  



D's quiet; there's a bit of back and forth, and then K asks him what his character shouted while attacking.  That sets D off grumbling about being cut off and other stuff.  App reminds D that he, App, is at work and is busy, so he couldn't interject sooner.  D counters something like, ""Maybe App shouldn't be playing D&D while at work.""  That's when I tell him we all get cut off sometimes.  It's like a pet peeve of D's; he's always complaining about getting cut off.

I told the closest people to me about it before I went in.

I didn’t tell one of my closest friends (34F) though because of her recent behaviour. We usually talk every single day about everything about our life & day on the phone & messaging but recently in the last couple of months she’s barely been replying, she’ll read my messages & not reply for days or most likely will not reply at all. Sometimes she’ll read & then a day or two later will reply just saying “lol” which obviously is odd.

",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,"AITA for not telling my close friend about my surgery? I (33F) recently had surgery for something that no one previously knew about, as in it wasn’t a medical issue anyone knew I had until I told them I was going in for surgery. I told the closest people to me about it before I went in.

I didn’t tell one of my closest friends (34F) though because of her recent behaviour. We usually talk every single day about everything about our life & day on the phone & messaging but recently in the last couple of months she’s barely been replying, she’ll read my messages & not reply for days or most likely will not reply at all. Sometimes she’ll read & then a day or two later will reply just saying “lol” which obviously is odd.

He recently got a ""new"" old car, despite me voicing concerns about it (German make, high maintenance, expensive repairs, it's older than his previous car, etc.) He's had it for a month, now, and has spent all of his free time working on it, fixing little issues, replacing parts, etc. We have emptied our car maintenance fund, and now a major part has stopped working. A shop quoted us $1500 to fix it, which is more than what we paid for the car. He decided to try to fixing it himself. The repair didn't work and we're now $300+ in and still no drivable car. 

I'm the one who handles all of our finances - he refuses to participate because he's ""no good at it and would screw it up"". So I'm the one stressing about how we're going to afford this and how he's going to get to work every day until it's fixed.

77,1c9iziv,AITA for “overreacting” to my nephew’s behavior at my wedding?,"  
I (25F) got married to my husband John (25M) last week and I are both really close to our families and we invited all of our siblings, nieces, nephews etc. I enjoyed my special day, but I had some issues with how my nephew, Blaze (11M) acted. Blaze is one of my sister Jenna’s (31F) kids.  
  
Issues with Blaze’s behavior started to arise pretty quickly, Blaze was not able to sit still during the ceremony and while we were exchanging vows, I saw him tapping his foot, tapping his fingers on the chair and other fidgeting around. Blaze has always fidgeted and I asked Jenna in advance to make sure he wouldn’t, and she said she’d “do the best she could”.   
  
We also had a trivia game we found in the thrift store about babies, it was meant for baby showers but we played it at our wedding, while we aren’t expecting kids yet, we thought it would be a fun game. Blaze knows A LOT of random stuff, and he ended up winning the game. After the wedding, a few guests told me they were upset as they felt Blaze embarrassed them in front of their kids by knowing more about child development than them.   
  
My final straw was when it as time to eat, I went to see my Jenna and I saw Blaze just sitting with some family talking about his basketball team, I told him he could get up and get some food and he came back with chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw and a loaded baked potato. I asked why he didn’t get anything else and he said none of the other food looked appetizing. Blaze is a picky eater and I encouraged him to try some other foods, and he did, but he spit them out and said they were bad.  
  
I’ve been texting Jenna this past week about Blaze’s behavior at the wedding, she said she tried her best to get him to behave but it was his first wedding and to be easy on him, this is despite the fact her younger kids had no issues. I was talking to John about this and he said to let this go and told me I was “overreacting”, he said we knew Blaze was a bit odd and that if I didn’t want him acting so odd, I shouldn’t have invited him.

She invited us once again this year for lunch. Everyone agreed to come, so I did too, not thinking it was a big deal. I'm at uni so I live at a different place from my parents while I'm there and I come back during weekends (not this weekend though).

I called my parents to talk to them and mentioned the easter lunch. They said we had to eat lunch together as a family for easter and kinda judged my friends for not doing it too.

My mom got really angry and kept saying how she doesn't care and I can eat easter lunch wherever I want and she won't even try to make a good lunch. I could tell she was upset, so I said that I'll just tell my friends I'll have lunch with my family instead. She kept saying that I don't have to have lunch with my family (in an angry tone). I tried to make the situation better, but it didn't work.

I called mom later and I could tell by her tone that she was still upset.

We both work at the same holiday park. My boyfriend (16m) also works here and he was kicked out of his house about 4 months ago and became homeless. So I asked my roommate if he could stay and that was fine. He was not allowed to pay rent since that is subletting and he could not be on the lease because of his age. It was all discussed with our landlord and he was fine with it. 

It went pretty well, my roommate was barely home anyway so I had company as well. My bf did most of the household chores since he only works weekend and me and my roommate both have full time jobs. 
There was a bit of friction in the beginning but after my roommate got a gf he was fine with my bf living with us and even said he could stay with us instead of living in the company housing. 

My roommate suddenly send a text in the group chat of me, my bf, him and another friend:

""Heeyy, I just 'cleaned' (he threw everything in another room) the living room and I'd like to keep it how it is now. Bf, I dont think its possible with you living here so I want you to go into the company housing (he doesnt work enough to qualify). All the stuff that was downstairs is now in the shed incase you cant find it, its there. OP, I hope we can keep the living room like this togheter. 
Have a good day!""

I was incredibly mad and told him that if he was to throw out my bf I wanted him to contribute to the household as well. 
Like, cleaning his facial hair out of the sink, putting his dishes away, maybe sweep the floor some time, tiny stuff like that which he never did.

I (21M) live in a shared student house with 4 other people. 

the house has 3 floors, the ground floor has the front door (obviously), my bedroom, a bathroom and the communal kitchen and living room space. 

each of the other two floors have two bedrooms and a bathroom. Everyone in all of the other bedrooms has to share a wall with someone else and they also have a bedroom directly above or below them.

I definitely have lucked out with my bedroom, on the floor directly above my room is a hallway so I dont have to worry about upstairs neighbour behaviour, there's no one below me so I can be loud and I share a wall with a bathroom that no one but me ever uses. 

the thing is tho even tho I love my bedroom, the reason why I have it is because I lost a coin toss because no one wanted to sleep on the ground floor or near the communal areas bcs they thought we'd use them a lot more/a lot more loudly than we actually do rather than just coming in and out. 

there's a lot of hostility in my house because my housemates want to take my bedroom away from me and instead want to have a competition every week and whoever does the most chores gets to sleep in the bedroom for a week, which I think is very impractical and stupid. They say its unfair I get the room in the quietest part of the house while being allowed to be as loud as I want, also basically having an en suite because it's right next door and also occasionally I have slept in the communal living room and they think it's unfair I can do that because it's so close to me. also my bedroom is the biggest bedroom in the house, it's only very marginal. 

they especially think this is unfair because they are all doing academic degrees where they have early lectures and need quiet to study and I'm doing an fine art degree where I blast music to zone out while I finish my projects. The thing about that though is the only people they are disturbing are each other and if they weren't so loud it wouldn't be a problem, I'm not disturbing them.

My brother has 3 kids in private school, he doesn't have much money to spare. I'm on maternity leave and the amount she needs will wipe out my savings and I'd have to use my husband's money as well to cover this debt which I don't think is fair.  
  
Especially since she doesn't want to get a job after this debt is cleared because she's ""an entrepreneur at heart"" and ""working for someone's company is soul crushing"". She wants to open a food truck even though they aren't popular in the town she lives in and always go out of business. My mom isn't a bad cook but she's competing with professional chefs and I'm sure she'll give up as soon as it gets hard.  
  
My dad says he plans to sell the house and his car and move his tenants out of the apartment he owns. My mom called me crying because she loves her neighbourhood and has lived here for 35 years, she says I'm selfish and evil for not paying her debt because she'll pay me back when she expands her food truck business...She doesn't understand why I don't just use my husband's money ""since he won't notice it's gone"". My mom has threatened not to allow me to see my younger siblings who I’m close with and to have me exiled by our entire family.

83,1c9hzdn,AITA for making my daughter shower in PE?,"Throwaway account for personal reasons.

I (F45) have a 14-year-old daughter, who I'll call Mikaela. Mikaela has barely hit puberty and is less developed than the majority of her peers, which I believe is something she is self-conscious about.

Last week, my husband and I received an email from Mikaela's school saying that because it was approaching the summer, it would now be mandatory for all students to shower after PE. I understand the logic; Mikaela does PE before lunch and if she doesn't shower, she'll be sweaty for the rest of the day, which I don't believe is hygienic. The school requested that we pack a towel and any shower gel for the next PE lessons to ensure the students were ready.

When I mentioned this to Mikaela, she said she would refuse to shower. Since the showers are communal, she told me she did not want to be naked in front of everyone else and would just get dressed. I told her she couldn't do this as the school were enforcing it, plus I felt it was healthy for her to shower. Again, she asked me to email the school to say she wouldn't be participating, but I refused to do so.

On Friday, despite many protests, I managed to make Mikaela go to school with her towel/shower stuff packed. I felt like I was doing the right thing. However, when Mikaela got home, she'd been crying all day saying how she'd had to get naked in front of everyone to shower and she'd never been so embarrassed because she saw one or two of the girls laughing at her. I told her how sorry I was and that teenage girls are horrible and that she's beautiful, but for hygiene reasons, she still has to shower. I suggested bringing in a swimming costume to wear to shower in, but she said that would bring even more attention to her. She begged me to email to school to not let her shower, but I said I had no good reason to, and I'm sure all of the other girls feel the same.

She told me she hated me and has barely spoken to me the rest of this weekend. My husband feels I should send an email as it doesn't hurt and Mikaela is clearly bothered, but I don't think it's a big deal, she will eventually get over it, and it's important for hygiene reasons.

We were already 10 minutes late, and my parents are always super punctual and I didn't want to keep them waiting any longer for us.

As we approach the escalator down to our subway platform, I can hear our train approaching. So, I tell my wife that we need to catch the train, and we both hurry down the escalator, me in front of her. When we got to the bottom, I heard the subway door chimes, indicating that the doors were about to close. So, I rushed into the train at the last moment, but my wife was left on the platform of the other side.

I thought, okay, well this sucks that I made the train but my wife didn't. But it's not really a big deal because we both know exactly where we are going, and it's only 5 stops away. I will just meet her at the restaurant. (I don't get any cell service underground, so we couldn't communicate with each other)

So I arrive at the restaurant alone and greet my parents, who immediately question me about where my wife is. I told them what happened, and they didn't really seem to think much of it. But when she gets there 20 minutes later, she is all angry at me for not getting off the train at the next stop and waiting for her there, then getting on that train and continuing together. It made for a bit of an uncomfortable brunch, because we could all tell there was tension. After the brunch on our way home, she explained why she was mad and then became all short with me and pretty much gave me silence the rest of the way home.

My position is that we both knew where we were going and she knew my parents are easily irritated when I arrive late, so why would I have gotten off the train to wait for her unnecessarily?

86,1c9h7us,AITA for not going to my 'best friends' wedding and going to another country instead?,"Throwaway account so not to be connected to my other 

Note: I am NOT from the US 

I (M25) have a friend we will call Brian. We have been friends for around 8 years now and I considered him my brother. While we always had our differences, we always stuck together.

Around 2 years ago, we worked together on a small private project (We just wanted to try our hand at developing something). He criticized almost everything I did and took the fun out of it. We got through it, but I told myself that I would never be able to work with him again.  

This has been an ongoing pattern that I noticed around a year ago now. I planned a trip to the USA to meet some friends. I met these people the exact same way I met Brian and have stayed at Brian's house multiple times. 

Brian loves to brag to me about his accomplishments and all of the plans he is making but never finishes them. 

Brian has a fiancée (Now wife) that he has been engaged to for 7 years now. I planned my trip to the USA 5 months in advance and told him about it. 

After that, he sort of changed...for the lack of a better word? He began to become manic and just jumping around from one thing to another. Constantly texting/calling about mundane things, talking about how he wants to 'put me under his wing' etc... It became a lot. 

He also magically selected a date to get married...right after I told him the date of my trip to the USA. It was actually a few days ago and congratulated him. He simply responded 'thanks' 

There are a lot of other things that he has done but this is the one that bothered me the most because my friends say that he is jealous of what I am doing and wanted me to pick him over a trip that I paid for in advance. 

I honestly have no anger about it, but I believe he does not want me to do better? He always tells me about missed opportunities and that he regrets where he is in life right now. I honestly do not think that I did anything wrong by missing the wedding and people tell me that I did the right thing. (The tickets were almost 2k) and I couldn't get a refund 

He's obviously sulking about it and I have been distancing myself as I look back on other things.

87,1c9h7tl,AITA for refusing a coworkers gift of used housewares?,"So I (30F) recently eloped with boyfriend, well now husband (39M). We purchased a home on the lake in a new subdivision and it is truly our dream home. We had closed on our house about a month prior to the elopement so we already had moved our belongings in and purchased anything else we needed and sold any other belongings that we had in each of our apartments since the leases were up or almost up. 

Once some of my coworkers found out we had eloped, they wanted to throw me a shower. I politely told them I was perfectly fine with having a little party to celebrate but no gifts. When asked why no gifts I told them honestly didn’t need anything. Typically in my area when a wedding shower or housewarming party is thrown people gift toasters or sets of dishes etc. Our home is furnished. We both have successful jobs. “No gifts or monetary gifts please. But we would love to celebrate with you. Your presence is the only gift we want.” That was basically the conversation. And it was received well. The party happened and all went well. 

Yesterday a coworker who had not came to the party randomly showed up at our home. I am not close with this person. We actually try to avoid each other most days. Anyways, she arrived at our home with 3 large black trash bags that contained used houseware items from her home. She said she “knew it was hard when you are first starting out” and thought these items could help us “while we get on our feet”. She also made a comment about how she was going to have a garage sale but would rather just give them to someone who needed them. 

I told her I really appreciated the thought but that we were settled and maybe she should take her items give them to someone who needed them because we were on our feet. She said I was just  being modest. She ended up refusing to tell me how she got my address and also refused to take her “gifts” back with her. I told her we didn’t need her items but if she wanted to leave them I would be happy to donate them for her. She said I was being rude. She did leave the bags though and I am taking them to a local consignment store that sells items and uses the money to help survivors of domestic violence.

During our relationship they did get closer because they validated my fiancé's bad experiences with his mom and they accepted that she did a poor job after his dad died and had really messed with my fiancé's head. 

My fiancé's mother had two additional children before he moved out of her house. She has a daughter who would be about 9 now and a son who would be 11 I think. I have never met them so I could be off by a year or two. My fiancé does not see these kids, he does not want to see them or have any contact with them. This was always something he was honest about. He never wanted to reconcile with his mother and would never be okay with anyone attempting to encourage that and he also had no interest in getting to know her children either now or in the future. I accepted that. His grandparents said they understood this.

But they were lying. After we got engaged his grandparents invited us over for dinner at their house and who was there? The kids. My fiancé was furious and the grandparents had already told them about my fiancé and the fact we were getting married. His half sister was super excited and had wanted to meet him for ages and was given the idea by the grandparents that she and her brother would be at the wedding. My fiancé demanded to speak to his grandparents and he told them they had crossed a line and could get themselves out of it because there was no way he was inviting the kids.

We left after this and his grandparents reached out multiple times to scold my fiancé and tell him he shouldn't take his issues out on the kids and he should embrace having siblings. His response was fuck biological ties and fuck the idea that he's going to accept any of his mother's additional children into his life because he doesn't care if they have a DNA connection or not.

After enough of these arguments and my fiancé blocking them they reached out to me and asked me how I could marry someone who would reject his own flesh and blood and two kids at that, one who had been so excited to meet him and be part of his life. They told me that should make me hate him to see him crush her the way he did. I told them I don't put their actions (telling the kids, bringing them to the house, setting us up) on my fiancé because he was always clear on this. They accused me of being heartless to innocent children I have no prior bad history with because I defend him. I shook it off but they really didn't like me blaming them and have since said I'm not only heartless but rude.

We live in different cities and usually see each other around four times a year. When he visits me I have made plans in anticipation; nothing elaborate, just a couple of places to visit for a walk, a movie at the cinema, a nice cafe or pub.

When I visit him my main activity is watching him go about his normal activities as a husband, a father, a dog-owner. There will be two or three hour stretches where he's doing other things or where I don't even know where he is so I just sit at the kitchen table on my laptop or read a book. 

When we go somewhere it's with the whole family, so most of his attention is spent looking after the kids and I basically feel like an au pair or family servant carrying the extra bags. When we get back he has to walk the dog for an hour and a half. Then it's feeding the kids, bath time, bed time, etc, so the only time we actually spend together is two hours at the end of the day when we just watch a movie in silence.

Whenever my dad wants me to do something, he always tells me to do it immediately. No planning and no taking into account that I'm in the middle of doing something. It's always NOW. And it has been like this for years. Only exception is if I'm studying for exams, he won't bother me at all (and he becomes helpful and supportive), but for normal everyday stuff, he wants to plan stuff out of the blue.

Dad: ""Now""  
Me: ""But I'm in the middle of reading""  
Dad: ""You can read when we come back""

And I feel that I'm starting to procrastinate because of that. Even when I actually want to do whatever he asks me to do, I just subconsciously push it away and try to procrastinate on that thing.

Because of upcoming exams, I didn’t really have the energy to plan/have a party, and I didn’t even tell my friends it was my birthday. I planned on having a small celebration with my family, just presents and a take-away, and then have a proper celebration after exams. Well, it came to my birthday, and my little sister (who’s 14) was being really objectionable, pushing for us to have birthday cake when I wanted to take my time opening my presents, not contributing to the conversation, always looking at the clock, etc. She didn’t even get me a present – she did give me one, but it was obviously one my mum had got on her behalf, and she confessed later that evening. I’m not on the best terms with my sister (no real reason, just teenage angst on her part) so I let it slide.  
We ordered a takeaway, and I decided to have a relaxing bath while we waited for it to come. I told my family this, got the bath supplies and went to the bathroom. By the time I got there, my sister had stolen the plug. For context, she’s got this weird thing about the bathroom, hates anyone else using it, so we clash a lot because I absolutely love long bubble baths. Because of this, I usually wait until she’s out the house to have my baths, even though that leads to having to schedule my day around her (which is really inconvenient). But I thought since it was my birthday and she hadn’t even got me anything, she’d at least let me have this. Nope. I told my parents the situation, and they asked her for the plug back, she denied taking it, and the whole thing devolved into an enormous argument. My sister refused to return the plug so in the end my mum found this random other plug that also worked. I had my bath, the takeaway arrived, I got dressed and came down. It was already super tense and awkward in there, with the argument still going on, so I asked my sister to leave because she was really bringing down the atmosphere. I said she could take her food with her to the lounge and eat it while watching a movie or something. She refused to eat in the lounge, the argument continued, and in the end we (my mum, dad and I) left the room to let her at first, and then had our (slightly cold) takeaway – really late because of all the arguing.

98,1c9dru9,AITA for being extremely angry at my grand-parents,"AITA to not want to forgive my grandparents. I am sorry, English isn't my first language ! So I 25F and my boyfriend 30M had an agrement with my grand-parents to buy their house. They posses a beautiful duplex on a street where all my close family lives. It was always a dream of mine to live in their house one day. 

At Christmas 2023, we knew that their tenants were leaving in august 2024 so we talked to them about renting one of their unit, they live in the other. They were thrilled and told us they would think about it. To our surprise, they asked us if we would want to buy the duplex instead. Their plan was to build a new house next to the duplex. My grandfather is 72 years old and had is own construction company, he still does contract in the summer. They are both really healty and active.

Buying for us was ideal, we already had a house that we decided to keep and rent. We decided to wait before leasing it to be sure that my grand-parents were confortable with their decision. It was a big process with many changes along the way. The original price was 300 000$, because of the material and contruction cost augmentation they asked us 425 000 instead, which is still way below market value. It was tight for us but we did manage. The plan was for them to be our tenant for a year and they would move in their brand new house when it would be finished. At Easter, they insisted that we sign a promess to purchase, which we strongely agreed. We found a tenant quickly for our present house after that and the lease was signed. We also made it official with the rest of the family and everybody was congratulating us.

Yesterday, my grandmother called to tell me that they changed their mind, they feel like they don't have the energy anymore to build a new house, that it is too much for them, that their health was more important than all. They say we could still rent one part for 950$ all included. I am absolutely broken, sad and angry about that decision. We were so excited about all the project we would have for the house and our lives. We don't want to be tenant, we wanted to renovate and make one big house when my grandparents would move. We are currently trying to get pregnant and were so thrill to raise children in this house with all my family near. It is still possible but it will not be the same, we will always have to be careful for the noise. My grandmother told me that they want calm and quiet so they want to test if we like to be close neighbors for a year. They don't want to feel thrown out of their home. IF it was anybody else in the world, they would be obligated to sell the house anyways because of the promess to purchase that we would applied.

So am I the asshole to be very angry at them and not sure at all that I can forgive them one day. They had time to realize how hard it was and now we can't go back. I am compassionate about their health but they had to figure it out sooner in my opinion.

Thank you for your future insight.

At Christmas 2023, we knew that their tenants were leaving in august 2024 so we talked to them about renting one of their unit, they live in the other. They were thrilled and told us they would think about it. To our surprise, they asked us if we would want to buy the duplex instead. Their plan was to build a new house next to the duplex. My grandfather is 72 years old and had is own construction company, he still does contract in the summer. They are both really healty and active.

Buying for us was ideal, we already had a house that we decided to keep and rent. We decided to wait before leasing it to be sure that my grand-parents were confortable with their decision. It was a big process with many changes along the way. The original price was 300 000$, because of the material and contruction cost augmentation they asked us 425 000 instead, which is still way below market value. It was tight for us but we did manage. The plan was for them to be our tenant for a year and they would move in their brand new house when it would be finished. At Easter, they insisted that we sign a promess to purchase, which we strongely agreed. We found a tenant quickly for our present house after that and the lease was signed. We also made it official with the rest of the family and everybody was congratulating us.

Yesterday, my grandmother called to tell me that they changed their mind, they feel like they don't have the energy anymore to build a new house, that it is too much for them, that their health was more important than all. They say we could still rent one part for 950$ all included. I am absolutely broken, sad and angry about that decision. We were so excited about all the project we would have for the house and our lives. We don't want to be tenant, we wanted to renovate and make one big house when my grandparents would move. We are currently trying to get pregnant and were so thrill to raise children in this house with all my family near. It is still possible but it will not be the same, we will always have to be careful for the noise. My grandmother told me that they want calm and quiet so they want to test if we like to be close neighbors for a year. They don't want to feel thrown out of their home. IF it was anybody else in the world, they would be obligated to sell the house anyways because of the promess to purchase that we would applied.

So am I the asshole to be very angry at them and not sure at all that I can forgive them one day. They had time to realize how hard it was and now we can't go back. I am compassionate about their health but they had to figure it out sooner in my opinion.

Thank you for your future insight.

99,1c9dqa9,AITA for telling my mother I find her more unbearable than the puppy,"I (29F) recently adopted a puppy (Menta, 9 weeks). Due to life circumstances I currently live with my mother (65F). Despite me being the sole owner and caretaker, as this is her home I had to be sure she was on board with the adoption. She ended up saying yes, and even offered to help me.

Now that the puppy is at home everything is a little bit chaos. That's to be expected from such a young puppy, but I find myself getting more stressed about my mother's reactions. She's always been an anxiety prone person (like me), but I've never seen her at this level of nervousness. I can't leave her alone with Menta without being worried about what's going on with them.

She says things like ""she's mean"", ""she's aggressive"", ""she's defiant"". The problem is my mother expects Menta to behave like a grown dog instead of like the puppy she is. Every single person we've talked to tells her that the behavior is normal.

Today, in the middle of the night, Menta was feeling unwell at seemed like she was going to throw up, so I stayed awake with her to keep an eye on her health. She ended up being okay, and sleep well the rest of the night, but I found it hard to fall back asleep.

In the morning, as usual, the puppy woke me up and I went with her to great my mother. I told her about my ""sleepless"" night, and then went to the kitchen to feed Menta and have breakfast. Everything normal. 

But when my mother emerged in the room I noticed she seemed to be off. When I asked her what was wrong she told me that she was nervous because I was unable to sleep. I told her that I did sleep, I only lost a couple of hours. And we were talking about me, I've always been a terrible sleeper, even during my childhood.

An argument ensued in which every time I said I was actually ok she'd come up with a negative retort about Menta's behavior. ""But yesterday she took too long to settle for the night"" and ""we can't pet her without her biting us"".

I was so feed up I ended telling my mother that I found her behavior more unbearable than Menta's behavior. Now she is skulking around the house and hasn't said barely anything to me 

Now I feel bad because I know she has is stressed and doing the best she can.

 i just summed it up to her having alot on her hands since she has a lot of mental health issues and so i allowed her to treat me how she did, and to be honest some her actions and they way she talked to me scared me a bit, making me nervous or terrified to talk to her me and Ariana’s friendship hasn’t been the same ever since she started getting into drugs and going down a wrong path, but i’ve stayed because i know how hard addiction is.

 these past 5 months way too much has happened and i felt it hasnt been fair on me at all, one day she texted me saying she was going to lend my airpods since she needed them for work (i left them at her place because i thought i could trust her with them) and when i came over 6 days later and bought them up, she said they were stolen and she couldnt do nothing about it.

 i was certainly pissed off on the inside but i stayed cool on the outside to make sure no arguments would happen, so i decided to go home. i know it was my fault for leaving my own Airpods there but i trusted her alot with my things, i did communicate to her that i did trust her with that and she wasn’t taking good care of my things, but she said i could just get a new pair for my birthday. those airpods were way out of budget for my family and i told her i couldn’t just get a new pair, she just argued with me which i eventually apologised for.

102,1c9dj80,AITA for no longer wanting my distant cousin to stay at my house,"I 19 F was told by my mum last August that I’ll have to share my room and my bed with a distant cousin 21 F who is here for uni and who I had never met. She told me it would be temporary until she finds her own place and I agreed.

Two things to know about me is that I don’t like being touched by people (I don’t even show physical affection to my mum it’s just not my thing) and I like being alone after work/ going out cause I’m introverted and I need to recharge. So you can imagine sleeping with someone who does not know how to share a bed and keeps on accidentally kicking and kneeing me throughout the night, as well as sleeping till 4pm a lot of the days has been very difficult. I feel like I have to plan what I do around her schedule and I haven’t been able to sleep properly for months. 

And it’s not like she has a bad personality, she’s nice which makes it worse I think. It’s just that the way she sleeps and her lack of respect for my personal space makes it worse. An example is even when she’s awake she gets so close that when she’s on her phone she accidentally hits my head even thought there’s more than enough space for that not to happen. 

My room no longer feels like my room and I have nowhere to unwind and chill, my mum no longer refers it to my room but “our” room which ticks me off. She told me it would be temporary but with the way her and my mum speaks I think she’s planning on staying here until she graduates.

This is like my own personal hell. I’m trying to confront my mum about this but she keeps dodging the question. But I’m planning on speaking to her and explaining that this was not what I agreed too and me and the girl are not compatible.

The problem is that where I live has a housing crisis and people can’t afford to live, I feel like if I say that I can’t share my bed that I’ll be forcing her and her mom to spend so much as she doesn’t have to pay rent here. I feel like an AH but I just want to go back to having my own space.

103,1c9dbzp,AITA for expecting an apology from my bf after he ruined a concert from me?,"Writing in mobile and English is not my first language,  so bear with me. 

I (40M) Just turned 40 a few weeks ago and me sister gave me 2 tickets for a concert as a present. This concert was for a male solo singer songwriter I really like (liked) as an artist and also find attractive. 
My bf (32M) doesn't like this singer and is always making negative comments about his songs and looks like ""he looks like (something nasty), I don't know what you see in him"". 

A little back story,  we've been to several concerts for this singer before. He kinda like a few songs and know the lyrics, but he's not excited to go or sing along, he just sits there and waits for all to be over. 
So I stopped going to concerts for this singer, one, because money is tight and two because I don't have a good time either if he's just there not enjoying the moment with me.  

When my sister gave the tickets, this time I tried to invite her or my mom or my cousin but neither couldn't/wanted to go, and I don't know any other person who likes this singer, so I asked my bf if he could go with me.

The day of the concert we get there on time and we're waiting for it to start, so he took his cellphone and started playing a game we like. When the show started I was so excited but I noticed he was still playing the game. So I made a hand gesture asking him to stop playing and watch the show. A few seconds I ask him again. And a few seconds later I said ""hey, stop playing,  I've told you 3 times already"".  Immediately he turns to me and shouts: ""Shut up"".
After that he just sat with his arms crossed.
I was so uncomfortable and hurt by his actions that about 5 songs into the concert I stood up and said lets go, we're going home. He asked why and I said I wasn't confortable. He didn't said anything,  just follow me to the car, never tried to stop me. For some reason he was mad too.

I was so feed up by his demeanor that I deleted every song from my Playlists, throw away t-shirts, mugs, cds from this singer. He ruined this for me. 

We haven't spoken ever since. It's been 3 days. Today he asked me: ""are you gonna talk to me again ""  and I respond with ""do you have something to say?""

I expect him to approach me and apologize for what happened.  But for some reason if I  get mad at something he gets mad too. He's too proud to even recognize what he did wrong.

Throwaway A/c 

My(17m) Grandfather passed away three weeks ago but it was not a surprise by any means. Since my Father is an only child(49m), inheritance was not much of an issue except the ancestral jewellery. In our culture, Gold has a lot of sentimental value. It is usually passed down from a mother to daughter or a grandmother to granddaughter.(The literal word for such inheritances in my culture is female's treasure.)

Unfortunately, My great-grandmother did not have a daughter or a granddaughter or a great-granddaughter and thus, after her demise, the gold was passed down to my grandfather. 

Now my Step-Mother(47f) believes that the gold should be passed down to her daughter Anne(21f). My father is a people pleaser and is one of the purest souls that have ever come to be. He has made sure to make feel Anne included in our family and tried to be her Father. But Anne is an a-hole. She is rude, obnoxious and a pain in the ass. She never gave my father the love and respect that he deserves.

My Grandparents tried to include her a few times but due to her immensely delightful nature, started to ignore her. They hated her for treating my father the way she did.

I had a talk with my father about this and he reprimanded me saying that Anne is my sister. I said that the jewellery now belongs to him and after which will be passed down to me or I will be well within my rights to file a case due to it being ancestral property.

Here Is why I might be the asshole:- He then told all of this to his wife and Anne and they were enraged. They attacked me together with their logicless points and at one time told me that I had no right upon the jewellery since ""men can't inherit Jewellery."" I then told them that by that logic, I will have a complete right over Anne's maternal grandparents' assets since ""Girls can't inherit property.""
I was called a sexist and greedy pig and they duly stormed off my dorm.
Now my extended family told me that they are busy speaking Ill of me to our family and friends.

TL;DR: my stepsister wanted my grandfather's gold and I told her to fu*k off.

It seems like they take everything as a personal attack on them.

they live beneath us. An hour or so later my mother (who doesn't like my  
grandparents because she thinks they are with my father to throw her out of the

that I'm going to eat with my grandparents.

is from my grandmother to ask me and not her, if I can come for breakfast  
(remember, I'm 16), how everyone is against her and wants to throw her on the  
street. She asks if we can't even have breakfast once a week together, since we  
stand up at different times on workdays. She says, that I'm her child and that  
she should know where I am, which isn't wrong, but she would have known where I  
was. 

I told her, that I was old enough to decide for  
myself when I want to visit my grandparents.

She told me how sad it makes her, that I would  
go to my grandparents, how hurt she felt. I don’t even know, if I can trust her  
statement, since she changed a lot after my father wanted the divorce.

I don’t know if she genuinely wanted to tell me  
how she felt, or if she wanted to guilttrip me into not going.

they live beneath us. An hour or so later my mother (who doesn't like my  
grandparents because she thinks they are with my father to throw her out of the  
house) tells me, that she wants to make an extensive breakfast. So, I tell her,  
that I'm going to eat with my grandparents.

She is angry, she tells me how disrespectful it  
is from my grandmother to ask me and not her, if I can come for breakfast  
(remember, I'm 16), how everyone is against her and wants to throw her on the  
street. She asks if we can't even have breakfast once a week together, since we  
stand up at different times on workdays. She says, that I'm her child and that  
she should know where I am, which isn't wrong, but she would have known where I  
was. 

I told her, that I was old enough to decide for  
myself when I want to visit my grandparents.

She told me how sad it makes her, that I would  
go to my grandparents, how hurt she felt. I don’t even know, if I can trust her  
statement, since she changed a lot after my father wanted the divorce.

I don’t know if she genuinely wanted to tell me  
how she felt, or if she wanted to guilttrip me into not going.

In the end, I told her, that I am in no condition to handle her feelings as well.

106,1c9ce3y,AITA Partner wants to move back home with our young child,"Hi! My partner of 10 years (30M) wants to move back home to be closer to his family and friends. He has been noticeably depressed for the past year or so and I (30 F) also struggle with mental health issues. 

We moved 7 hours away from our friends and family to live near my elderly grandmother (88F) so that I could take care of her. She is chronically ill and has no one else available to help her out. She raised me and is more like a mother than a grandmother. We have been away from other family members for 4 years now. 

Recently the conversation came up that he wants to move back home to be near family and friends and since I cannot leave my grandmother, I would stay here.  I am also in a phD program at the local university and still have several more years left. We both initially agreed that I could go back to school and that I would not have to work. We had this agreement for 3 years now and every step of the way he has been supportive until recently. The thought of having 3-4 more years of my schooling does not sit right with him any longer. 

My partner also works from home and has no friends outside of the house. I have encouraged him to seek out new hobbies but he says he does not have the time and seems uninterested in making any. 

I do feel bad that he feels stuck here because we initially thought we would be here for only a couple years when we first moved, but things have changed. Again, he was in total support of me starting a local Phd program but like humans do, has recently changed his mind and has become uncomfortable with our situation. 

My grandma sees doctors every few months to get medical care, most of whom she has been with for 10 years +. It would be extremely difficult to move her to another state and quite frankly she does not want to move either. Neither do I and neither does our 6 year old. 

AITA for not wanting him to take our child and move back to his family even though he is the primary breadwinner and has offered to fly me out to see them every couple weeks? I feel horrible seeing him depressed, but I am pretty stuck where we currently are and have no desire to let him move with our child. My 6 year old and I are happy here, but he is not.

107,1c9c3ua,AITA for asking my cousin brother to not give anymore alcohol to his wife?,"I (F24) met my cousin V (M30) and his wife J (F22) recently for a cousin T’s wedding. Usually weddings in my culture proceed for a month, so usually family and friends get atleast 7-10 days to warm up to each other. When I threw the bachelorette party for my cousin, I came to find out that it was J’s first time drinking, like ever. She was more controlled that day, had about 2 cocktails and that’s it.

Fast forward to all of us bonding really well and getting alcohol to drink by ourselves. We were at a rooftop of the residence, and y hey got mainly hard brandy and we mixed coke with it. I’m someone who has a little more experience than J and T, and I’m also overweight so my tolerance for alcohol is much higher. V already was half high from downing 1/2 ltr of brandy and smoking tons, and J was kinda begging me to share my drink. I gave her just enough to feel the buzz, but I strictly said no more after that since I knew I wouldn’t be able to run after her if she got drunk. 

Mind you J was already getting quite drunk, she was walking but not straight. Hence I asked V to be carefulin giving drinks for her, as he wasn’t really paying attention to her anyway. V was making drinks for everyone including me, and when he passed me a drink J became pissed and yelled “if you’re making drinks you must share it with me too, why are you choosing her over me and never listen to me”. They ended up arguing the whole night. 

Her statement got me off guard, I just didn’t want things to become unsafe for her especially since her tolerance is really low, I was drunk and so was V, and we were on the roof.

I also got her some flowers, a card, a bottle of wine and some chocolates as a surprise to congratulate her on graduating.

  
After getting my final result and confirming I had passed I went and told my gf that I was finally qualified. She said well done and that she was proud of me but nothing else. I thought she might have a surprise or something planned for later so I didn't say anything straight away. Since it was the middle of the week I thought I'd wait until the weekend to see if she does anything.

  
The weekend came and nothing was planned. I jokingly asked where she's taking me for me finally qualifying then. She said we could go for drinks if I want but that I'd have to pay for my own. She could see I was disappointed so asked what was wrong so I pointed out everything I did for her for her graduation and then she couldn't do a single thing for me for mine.

  
I pointed out it didn't even need to be expensive, just a card, some wine etc or my favourite food/drink would have been enough but she couldn't even do that. She said I was being unfair and that she shouldn't be expected to have to do it but I just pointed out that you should want to do something nice when the person you're with is celebrating something.

We were going to go out to eat and bar hop, we stopped at a coffee shop to just hangout and talk.

I remember telling her “if this is the worst thing you this is fine haha”. She laughed and we went back forty minutes to get her license. While we were at the house I decided to eat half a lil gummie since it was a special occasion/I haven’t smoked in a WHILE. 

We pull up to the restaurant and as we were going in I took the other half. Stupidly. After thirty minutes it HIT. I was extremely cold, shaky and felt the world in slow mo. I’m a pretty seasoned partaker but this had me knocked and was my first time in a public place let alone a crowded restaurant. Sat in the bathroom truly just falling thru Dante’s inferno, I text my friend (the one who drove us over and whose best friend forgot her wallet. 

She helped me and let me go chill in her car. She smoked a lot in the past and explained that I just need to keep reminding myself that it will end and to try to eat cause it seems like my blood sugar was low and all that. She let me hangout in her car while I fought the consequences of my actions. I sat there for i think another twenty minutes which moved so slowly I could feel the seconds physically pass.

I regretted my choices in every moment. They comeback out and my friend (the driver) asked how I was feeling and I apologized profusely that I need to go home, I was so high that I had to move my legs every few seconds or they’d start twitching uncontrollably. I asked if they could shut the door, the light was giving me a headache. She shut they door and I heard the three of them talk.

The girl who originally forgot her wallet said “I drove here five hours away to take some girl home when I came here to hangout with my best friend??!?” then I stopped listening cause ouch. The third friend (the one who I haven’t mentioned yet) drove me home and dropped me off. I cried on the way home cause I feel so bad that I ruined everyone’s night. It’s not that I wanted to feel utter torture, I just messed u. The girl who complained has never smoked before so I don’t think she understands what that feels like.

None of us are particularly tech savvy. My brother gave his US model laptop to me for studying which isn't available in my country. The laptop unexpectedly shut down a couple days ago and wouldn't turn on or charge. I have a very important set of exams in 10 days. So after trying to revive the laptop for a couple of hours, I just made alternate arrangements to study (ex: my phone, a very old laptop). I tried all the things you can possibly do by yourself to revive the laptop except for actually opening it up, by looking at troubleshooting FAQs and reddit.
My mum helped by asking my cousin who's in cyber security and built his own computer from scratch about it and he also said that I did whatever I could do on my own and to wait and see for a couple of days. He said that if it doesn't work out, he'll help with taking it to the repair place to make sure they don't rip us off as we are clueless. 

So now comes the issue: I initially texted my brother about the issue and asked him stuff related to charger and issues he might've had while he was using it. He told me to wait and see and then call him to see what can be done further. Now, according to me I didn't finish waiting for the laptop to charge from being dead as sometimes laptops take days to turn on, hence I didn't call him or text him about it. Frankly, I also forgot about it because I was studying for the exams.
My brother now called my mum and told her that she isn't making arrangements for me to study comfortably and that she raised me to be stingy and adjust for things and that I don't feel comfortable talking on the phone to ask him for help but would ask my cousin instead. 

I told my brother that I don't want to get involved with bringing the laptop in for service when I barely have enough time before exams to study and I'd already made other arrangements. I also told him that I can't keep changing laptops because I already transferred the files to that old laptop to use temporarily. 

He's now angry at my mum for asking my cousin about helping with the laptop when he's there and with me for not depending on him to take care of things when he was the one who told my mum when she told him about this laptop issue that I need to be responsible and arrive at solutions myself instead of depending on others.

Here's the problem: I know about the things Julia said. Julia and I would be texting in and she would bring up Sarah and how she ""brainwashed out friends"" into thing that she was nice. Here's the argument starter: Julia has a boyfriend.

113,1c9b42d,WIBTA for not telling my in laws?,"I want to clarify before anyone even comments, that I’m asking for judgement about not including my in laws in what’s supposed to be a very personal experience for me and my husband.

My husband (22M) and I (23F) are expecting a baby girl this month, my estimated due date is the 25th.

Throughout my entire pregnancy, my husband’s parents have been very overbearing and unhelpful in the things that really matter. It was like pulling teeth making sure I got to my prenatal appointments on time when my husband was away at training for 2 weeks at a time and unable to take me himself. They also haven’t helped us get the things we need, like a crib and crib mattress that my friend, my mom and her sister ended up helping us get, or in general being supportive.

I’m not going to get into how they try to squeeze us for more money than what we agreed upon for renting a bedroom from them: that’s a whole ‘nother can of worms.

FIL is a former EMT/Medic/Firefighter, and my MIL had three sons, of whom my husband is the youngest. With this in mind, they tend to tell me exactly how they think my pregnancy is going to go, what labor and delivery is going to be like for me personally, postpartum recovery, infant care, etc. While I have been labeled as high risk due to a few factors including Gestational Diabetes, my pregnancy has not gone the way most “average” pregnancies go. I have expressed that while I appreciate their advice, it has not generally been applicable to me. This doesn’t stop them, though.

MIL seems to just be waiting, ready to “spring into action” for when I go into labor, and with how unbearable, opinionated, and in-my-personal-space she likes to get, I stress out thinking about it.

This Wednesday, I had an appointment where my midwife agreed with me about the risks of going past my due date, so we scheduled an induction at the hospital, early in the morning on the 24th (7:30 AM check-in time). I don’t want to talk to my in laws about it at all. The few times I mentioned possibly scheduling one before, I got “it’s better if you let it happen naturally” and “Going past your due date is normal, the baby will be fine,” etc from both of them.

I also do not want them constantly texting us asking for updates: is baby here yet, how are you doing, etc. While I have expressed that they can meet the baby when we come home because I don’t see the point in having them visit when we already live with them, I wouldn’t put it past my MIL to decide she’s going to come try to visit anyways and drag FIL along.

I am wondering, based on all of this, if I would be in the wrong for not telling my in laws about my induction date and/or birth of our daughter until after it has already happened? They would probably be upset (mostly my MIL) for not telling them so that they could “support” us or whatever.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,"WIBTA for not telling my in laws? I want to clarify before anyone even comments, that I’m asking for judgement about not including my in laws in what’s supposed to be a very personal experience for me and my husband.

My husband (22M) and I (23F) are expecting a baby girl this month, my estimated due date is the 25th.

Throughout my entire pregnancy, my husband’s parents have been very overbearing and unhelpful in the things that really matter. It was like pulling teeth making sure I got to my prenatal appointments on time when my husband was away at training for 2 weeks at a time and unable to take me himself. They also haven’t helped us get the things we need, like a crib and crib mattress that my friend, my mom and her sister ended up helping us get, or in general being supportive.

I’m not going to get into how they try to squeeze us for more money than what we agreed upon for renting a bedroom from them: that’s a whole ‘nother can of worms.

FIL is a former EMT/Medic/Firefighter, and my MIL had three sons, of whom my husband is the youngest. With this in mind, they tend to tell me exactly how they think my pregnancy is going to go, what labor and delivery is going to be like for me personally, postpartum recovery, infant care, etc. While I have been labeled as high risk due to a few factors including Gestational Diabetes, my pregnancy has not gone the way most “average” pregnancies go. I have expressed that while I appreciate their advice, it has not generally been applicable to me. This doesn’t stop them, though.

MIL seems to just be waiting, ready to “spring into action” for when I go into labor, and with how unbearable, opinionated, and in-my-personal-space she likes to get, I stress out thinking about it.

This Wednesday, I had an appointment where my midwife agreed with me about the risks of going past my due date, so we scheduled an induction at the hospital, early in the morning on the 24th (7:30 AM check-in time). I don’t want to talk to my in laws about it at all.

114,1c9b10n,AITA for not making any effort to keep track of friends' birthdays ,"

I am not good friend material, I admit. I (37F) am that rare creature that is perfectly happy alone.  I am not an introvert or shy or autistic or anything like that, I am actually very outgoing and quite sparkling (if I do say so myself) when I am with people, but I am also too lazy to enjoy going to many social functions or just even hanging out often. 

As a result, I am a BAD friend in the sense that I don't ever put any effort into maintaining friendships.  I don't ever treat my friends badly or take any advantage of them; I like to spend time with them in measured doses and put them up at my home in my highly touristy city when they want to visit.  However, I don't ever reach out to a friend on my own initiative, I don't remember anyone's birthday, I don't follow anyone's social media, I don't really keep track of anyone's life; it is always the friends who are reaching out, keeping in touch, setting up ways to spend time together, etc.  

As you can imagine, I don't have too many friends, but the dozen or so friends that I have managed to keep after all those years are absolute saints to put up with me.  They do all the hard work and I am very appreciative, but not appreciative enough to reciprocate the effort.  I have always figured that while I am probably never going to be a solicitous friend, I would also perfectly understand if they cease to be friends with me and will not raise the least objection or fuss if they decided it is too one sided and ghost me.  

Well, one of those friends of many years reached out yesterday to remind me that it was his birthday last week (he lives in a different country, so it is not like I am invited to the festivities).  I was like, ""belated happy birthday!"". He got kind of upset and complained that I never remembered his birthday year after year.  I pointed out that I don't remember anyone's birthday except my immediate family.  I also don't expect anyone except immediate family to remember my birthday but it always nice when they do.  He suggested that I put his birthday in my phone as an recurring calendar reminder.  I said, yes I know I can do that, but I don't have any plans to do.  I don't have a good reason to refuse, but I don't think I need a reason?  I am usually not happy about being pushed to do things. 

He got even more upset and I can understand why, but really, what I am doing or not doing is not harming anyone except possibly myself if my lazy attitude toward friendship ends up driving away my remaining friends.  That's a price I am willing to pay if it comes down to it.  He hang up eventually in a bad mood, but sent me an WhatsApp message later with just casual chit chat, so I am guessing he still wants to remain a friend.  

Now, I am not sure if I am an A for not acceding to a small request that would make him happy just because I don't want to.  ",No A-holes here,2024-04-21,"AITA for not making any effort to keep track of friends' birthdays

116,1c9ajcb,AITA for wanting to confront my friend for being cheap?,"
I recently had a situation that has been bugging me for months. My bf took up pottery and got really into it, and exceptionally good within a couple months. He ended up doing three 6-8 week courses of wheel pottery which ended up costing close to 1000$ and 30 hours of his time.

We bought my friend one of his handmade creations for her birthday and she loved it so much she approached my bf to ask if he would make her some stuff for Christmas gifts for her family and in-laws. My bf and I were about to leave the country for 6 months of travel and he happily agreed to make her some stuff. She said she would be happy to pay. Now I think it’s important to note this friend makes 150$ an hour and doesn’t have kids or a mortgage. Maybe I am the asshole because it was my bfs bad for saying “pay me what you think is fair” but he was thinking it was tacky to ask for a fixed price because she asked for a lot of pieces.

A couple weeks later my bf drops off a huge box of handmade pottery at her house and she is raving about it. It was over 20 pieces total. Weeks later she kept saying she was meaning to pay him and I guess we were thinking she would pay 100$ or so. Finally on our last day before we leave the country she offers to pay for our Uber to the airport to pay for the pottery for all her friends and family. The uber cost 30$.

118,1c9a7cy,WIBTA if I told my mom to keep paying for a shared Netflix account?,"First time posting here, will happily edit if things accidentally don’t meet requirements.

So I (28m) use my mom’s Netflix account. With the whole new crackdown on password sharing, she’s paying the $8 more a month as I live in a different state. She happens to use my HBO (now Max), Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney Plus. It wasn’t an arrangement or anything we had, I was paying for the subscriptions for myself anyways and I didn’t see any harm in letting her use my accounts too. I still don’t. About a week ago, she texted me saying that she was cutting me off the Netflix because she thought it was too expensive. Now, for those who may not know, Netflix is absolutely the most expensive streaming service, but she’s not cancelling the subscription for herself, just the extra $8 to have me on. I didn’t tell her at the time, but it bothered me.

My issue is, obviously, she’s still going to be using all of my subscriptions, which combined saves her far more than the amount she saves while cutting me off. She’s also not doing it because money is tight, my mom’s about to go on her third out of country vacation this year alone, and spends hundreds to thousands on her hobbies. I’m by no means throwing shade at her for all that, it’s her money and she can spend it how she likes. I’m only bringing it up here to assert that her choice to cut me off the Netflix subscription was not a financial one, it’s just on the principle that it’s expensive.

I’m a little worried that if I bring this up, I could be an AH because I’m essentially asking someone to spend money on me, but at the same time I’m also saving them money. And frankly I’m not going to withhold or threaten to withhold the subscriptions I pay for from her, but I’m worried pointing out that i provide these subscriptions could be scummy. She can also very easily feel “attacked,” even if that’s not the intention.

So I 19(F) am having to share my room with my 26(F) sister. So let me give you some background information. Me and my family( mom, dad, brother, sister and I ) all moved to a new state a few years back in order to get away from my other family members because they had always taken advantage of my parents' kindness by overstaying when they needed places to crash for a bit. Well we had gotten a 4 bedroom house, one bedroom for each of us and this was the first time I had gotten my own room. Since growing up there was always other faimly members staying at my parents house. 

Well a year ago my sister had moved out at 25 and now her room was given to my grandmother who has just recently moved in with us due to her age. Now everything is going well and I'm going to go to college but imagine my surprise when I find out that my Aunt (43 F) is moving from our home state to where we are now and that she would be living with us. Now I wasn't that upset as I was going off to college( the college is close enough that I come home on some of the weekends) so they gave my room to my Aunt, who said she wasn't going to be staying at our house for long, while I will be away at college for the 2 semesters. 

 Well that was at the beginning of August and she still hasn't moved out yet and it seems like she has no plans of wanting to move out. With college ending I was hoping to get my room back. My sister 26(f) also decided to move back In with my parents so she could save money.  So now there are 7 people trying to live in a 4 bedroom house. So my parents were trying to figure something out and they landed on the idea that me and my sister were going to share a room( we would have bunkbeds according to my parents) my Aunt was going to have the loft made Into her own room. So when I heard this I visibly got upset since I was hoping to have my own room. 

 Here is where I maybe the asshole I told my parents why can't my Aunt move out I mean she has a good paying job and I mentioned the fact that she is an adult. I said that my sister should get the loft so we all get our own rooms. Well my mom told me off saying that I should alway welcome faimly with open arms and that my Aunt should be able to stay with us. Now I'm not saying that we should kick her out with no warning but I am just upset that I am having to sacrifice my own space, while she gets her own.

She has always ignored my advice and acted like she knows too much.

She studied comp sci at university even though I warned her that tech careers were a bubble waiting to burst just like in the early 2000s. I advised her to use her math skills to do something useful like actuarial science and work in finance or insurance. 

I am not too disappointed about that as ultimately it is her career and it made her happy. But then she went on to do a masters as well and took on more debt to do so even though everyone told her it was useless.

Then she quit a nice stable job and went to a flashy job in the Bay Area for a major tech company (more on this later).

She then just last year bought a 1 bed apartment and put all her savings into it after she had only just paid off student loans and got a mortgage. I had told her to find herself a man before doing this so that they have a dual income safety net but she wants to make it alone as refuses to even consider it and says her dog is enough.

I have not yet answered her but I have been contemplating refusing since I feel she brought this on herself. It is not just her decisions, after she left she has insinuated that we liked her less because she was adopted and she had to do more chores than our son. While she did do more, she did so voluntarily at the time and it was hardly anything out of the ordinary. At the same time if I refuse, she might weaponize that as our son still lives with us although he is younger and has always followed our advice.

",Asshole,2024-04-21,"WIBTA if I did not help my daughter, who might become homeless due to her decisions to live with me again. I have a daughter (28F) who has always considered herself independent and never had the best communication with me ever since she turned 18.

She has always ignored my advice and acted like she knows too much.

She studied comp sci at university even though I warned her that tech careers were a bubble waiting to burst just like in the early 2000s. I advised her to use her math skills to do something useful like actuarial science and work in finance or insurance. 

I am not too disappointed about that as ultimately it is her career and it made her happy. But then she went on to do a masters as well and took on more debt to do so even though everyone told her it was useless.

Then she quit a nice stable job and went to a flashy job in the Bay Area for a major tech company (more on this later).

She then just last year bought a 1 bed apartment and put all her savings into it after she had only just paid off student loans and got a mortgage. I had told her to find herself a man before doing this so that they have a dual income safety net but she wants to make it alone as refuses to even consider it and says her dog is enough.

125,1c98k7v,"AITA for getting up and saying ""I don't like you attitude"" when my mom said another girl could have my clothes without my permission?","Hi reddit, this is my first post here, and mind you this just happened (I'm currently crying while writing this).

For context, I (20F) always had clothes that were given to me by others, that really saved my mom (40F) when I was younger, and even when older I never minded having another people's clothes nor giving mine away, but this time it was different...

My mom has a goddaughter (17F) that I always gave my clothes away to, and I'm friends with her, because we have a lot in common and she had my body type, so my clothes always fit her.

Earlier today my mom saw my old denim vests and asked if I would give them away to her goddaughter, I said ""she doesn't have the dripp to wear these"" and I thought she understood because she didn't ask again. The day passed almost too smoothly.

At dinner time the family of her goddaughter came to dine with us, and everything was fine, untill my mom called her to go into the room and asked her if she liked my clothes and proceeded to put my favorite denim vest on the girl and said she could keep it. I snapped, I got up and looked straight at my mom and said ""I don't like your attitude"", she gone ""what?"", and I repeated and said I didn't give her permission to do so. The girl took of my clothes and gave it to me with an awkward smile.

I entered the room where my mom was and she said I humiliated in front of everyone, I told her it wasn't right to just give my things away and she proceeded to tell me she expected me to use those denim vests every day from now on as an punishment. Then she got out of the room and everyone acted as if nothing happened. 

They left our home, and my mom didn't talk to me until my dad brought everything up and gave a speech about respect and how he was sad about how I handled the situation. He was already late for work and said he expected us both to apologize to each other.

I told my mother how much these clothes meant to me, how they were my style, my mark, back in the day. She doesn't get it, she argued that I don't use them anymore and how they don't fit me ( an common topic nowadays, about my weight, I don't have to tell the whole thing, you get it ).

I just started crying and she left the room saying ""I'm done, this is not the first time you've embarrassed me in front of others"" (another whole different story that I already apologized for) and ""I left it alone, and I will from now on, I don't care anymore, I treated you right, I cared about you, and that's what I receive"".

My brother tried to stay with me and understand me, but my dad didn't let him, so I had no option but to talk about it with my boyfriend. And she's there, on the kitchen, talking with my brother, like if I don't exist.

My boyfriend says that I should get another job and be gone from home more often or just move in with him. He knows a lot of what I've been going through, he's my light actually.

I can't face her, I can't afford the courage to apologize now. I don't know what to think or do anymore.

127,1c98h9n,AITA for refusing to go to formal with my friend because of his outfit?,"Last week, my friend, who never attends frat events and isn't particularly interested in them, drunkenly asked me to be his date for formal. He's not heavily involved in the frat scene and wasn't even aware of the exact date or time of the event. He basically mentioned he was going because he knew I enjoyed it last year.

Fast forward to today, and he tells me he's at the mall buying a new shirt, just six hours before the formal. He looked fine last year, so I assumed it was fine. When he arrived at my house tonight, I was shocked by his outfit. He was wearing a white shirt two sizes too big, khakis, black (work?) boots, and no tie or jacket. I tried to remain calm and suggested alternatives, but he insisted this was similar to what he wore last year, which I knew wasn't true because I had photos.

Meanwhile, I had put in a lot of effort into my appearance despite waking up sick and going to urgent care earlier today. Instead of canceling, I pushed through because I was excited to go.

I gently suggested we talk in my car away from my roommates because it's hard to hear criticism about one's appearance. As a former fat and ugly child, I know how hurtful it can be. I didn't outright say he looked bad but mentioned that his attire wasn't appropriate for the event, and I felt embarrassed and disrespected.

I suggested that we do something else and anything else he wanted, but he became defensive and started yelling at me, calling me shallow, dismissing my feelings of disrespect, and other irrelevant irrational things. I remained calm and tried to explain my perspective, but he refused to see my point of view.

I believe feeling disrespected is valid, given the effort I put into my appearance. While I understand everyone has different standards, I don't think it's acceptable to show up to a formal event dressed inappropriately, especially when inviting someone as a date.

He offered excuses like his original shirt having a stain and it being too hot for a jacket. After I declined to go, he claimed his friend was bringing him a tie and he had nicer shoes. At that point, it seemed pointless to attend, especially after the argument we had.

I also suspect he was lying about the tie.

129,1c986v2,AITA for agreeing to split the bill on a double date which ended in my best friend being dumped?,"Hi! I (22f) am really unsure here. My best friend and roommate (22f) Amiee had been seeing a guy for two months. She really likes him, it seemed to be going super well. 

Last night, she asked if I’d go along with a blind double date (ie. her and the guy she’s dating, me and one of his friends who is single and looking). I wasn’t keen at first but she insisted, so I agreed. 

We got to the restaurant, just a nice place in our area, and things seemed to be going fine. The friend she was “setting me up with” was cool, but I really am not looking right now and didn’t feel any kind of spark. 

We get to the end of dinner and the bill comes. Aimee chimes in and says “don’t worry, our men have got this” to which I say back, “ah, no I don’t mind”.
We’d had two cocktails each (all four of us) and it wasn’t a crazy expensive place but not cheap. 

A bit of back and forth happened, Aimee kept insisting it is always the gentlemen who pay, so I said something like, “you do you, I’m happy to split”. 

The guys were saying they would cover but both seemed uncomfortable. They paid, then we all left. Aimee and her boyfriend went back to his, I said good night to his friend and went home alone. Later, Aimee texted saying her man is now contemplating the relationship because he doesn’t want someone who always insists the men pay. She told me I ruined it by offering to split and should’ve sided with her, and not made things worse. She’s now saying he needs time and might not want to continue the relationship with her. AITA for this?

Update; thanks so much everyone for your thoughts on this one. Aimee still isn’t talking to me, you could cut glass with the tension in our place right now. She and the guy aren’t talking either. I’m trying hard here, but another week and maybe the friendship has run its course, honestly. Sensing a lot more underlying issues that can only come from communication, but hey.

Update; I’m now not a girls girl because I didn’t back her, without being told I should or given any kind of heads up. I responded that if I want to pay for myself (especially because I didn’t see myself and the blind date friend having a second date) was happy to put in for my portion. Friendship is effectively over, and I am looking to move out

Final update; Aimee is now trying to apologise because she can’t afford the rent on her own or get someone else to move in on such short notice. I feel horrible but know I need to be around supportive people, thanks again to everyone :)",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,"AITA for agreeing to split the bill on a double date which ended in my best friend being dumped? Hi! I (22f) am really unsure here. My best friend and roommate (22f) Amiee had been seeing a guy for two months. She really likes him, it seemed to be going super well. 

Last night, she asked if I’d go along with a blind double date (ie. her and the guy she’s dating, me and one of his friends who is single and looking). I wasn’t keen at first but she insisted, so I agreed. 

We got to the restaurant, just a nice place in our area, and things seemed to be going fine. The friend she was “setting me up with” was cool, but I really am not looking right now and didn’t feel any kind of spark. 

We get to the end of dinner and the bill comes. Aimee chimes in and says “don’t worry, our men have got this” to which I say back, “ah, no I don’t mind”.
We’d had two cocktails each (all four of us) and it wasn’t a crazy expensive place but not cheap. 

A bit of back and forth happened, Aimee kept insisting it is always the gentlemen who pay, so I said something like, “you do you, I’m happy to split”. 

The guys were saying they would cover but both seemed uncomfortable. They paid, then we all left. Aimee and her boyfriend went back to his, I said good night to his friend and went home alone. Later, Aimee texted saying her man is now contemplating the relationship because he doesn’t want someone who always insists the men pay. She told me I ruined it by offering to split and should’ve sided with her, and not made things worse. She’s now saying he needs time and might not want to continue the relationship with her. AITA for this?

130,1c97wlw,AITA because I want my parents to pay for my wedding?,"I (f/19) am islamically married to my husband (m/27) since june last year. This means we are a married couple in the name of god. My parents always told me they won't give away their only daughter without a wedding. As a child I didn't mind as much. Today I (and my husband) don't see a reason in a big wedding. So I told them. They weren't too happy about it. We don't want a wedding at all since religiously we already married and this is the most important point for both of us. But because of respect to my parents (and his but mainly mine) and because we don't want to have beef with my parents we tried to talk about a small wedding in a mosque. At first they agreed for the wedding to maybe be in a mosque. Now my and his parents decided to rent a big wedding location. They plan to invite about 120 people. For people from my culture this is small but when we said small we meant SMALL (and made that clear)... My husband and I weren't too happy about all of this. However we kind of agreed (again) because of respect and no beef. This whole situation is already crazy and shouldn't be created by my or his parents. But out of love and respect we would have pretended to enjoy our own wedding. Now comes the worst part. Yesterday we went to the location to sign a contract. My father, his father, him and I went and talked to the guy. They laughed and agreed in everything. Our fathers agreed to both pay 50%. I repeat OUR FATHERS said they would both pay 50%. My dad 50 his dad 50. When we were home my parents and I talked. Without even asking they expected from me that I would pay the % my father agreed on paying. I felt immensely disrespected. It's not only that I have to live through a wedding I don't even want. I also have to pay 50%. Of course I didn't agree. My father said if I am not going to pay, there would be no wedding which would mean he wouldn't give away his daughter... mind you he makes his only daughter go through this. I have one younger brother. Alhamdulillah financially we are fine. I always had to hear how my father financially supports our family back home. How he payed for the weddings of my aunts and uncles. He never complained. But now he makes me pay. It's not like I don't have the money. Alhamdulillah I was able to safe some money from when I was working. I am in university right now. Back then my parents never asked for my money. They said I should safe my money for when I need it. For my wedding and everything. They never said I have to pay the whole wedding. They said I have to pay my wedding dresses. They never said I will have to pay for a wedding me and my husband don't even want. They expect me to pay 50% for a wedding I can't even plan because every little suggestion I make is bad in their eyes and mostly gets ignored. I talked with my husband about it. His father will stay true to his words and pay the other 50%.

So aita because I want my parents to pay for my wedding?

edit: it has only been 24h and so much happened. One Information I forgot to mention: Since my parents will not give away their daughter without a wedding I still live with my parents.

Today my father and I went to my husband who currently lives in our home on his own. We went to get some packed stuff of mine to the flat. My husband confronted my father and I asked why I would have to pay for the 50% my father agreed in paying. It kind of didn't work out. My father repeated how he raised me, how I am his daughter and how my money islamically is his. I never ever heard of this and am kind of convinced he lies. Maybe somebody from here knows about it and could clear this up for me. We talked for like 2½ hours and in the middle of it I kind of started to scream at him and cried a little. It's just frustrating to me...

All the talk didn't do anything except for my parents to be mad at me because I talked to my husband about my father's lie. I don't see anything wrong with this. However my parents are extremely mad. They said, I chose my husband over my parents...

I also talked with my father in law on the phone. His words made me strong but I believe this time (as always when I don't agree with my parents) I am the loser.

131,1c97js5,AITA for expecting payment in spite of  friend’s/client’s Grandma’s death?,"I [32M] have a side hustle/hobby of doing yard work for a few clients/friends. I was recently put in contact with a friend of a friend [29F] ( let’s call her Megan) who had some jobs for me. The first couple of transactions went smoothly. 

We became pretty quick friends.

When she first mentioned she was struggling with money and asked for more time to pay for a job I was working on, I didn’t think twice about it. She asked for an extra day or two, but that turned into a few days. 

She eventually paid though. This happened a couple times. She’d have a job, I’d do it knowing that she wouldn’t be able to pay right away, and it would still take her longer to pay than the timeframe we’d agreed on. 

Each time this happened I would feel that she was less talkative, distant. 

Well fast forward to maybe 3 weeks ago, same situation. I’m owed money, it’s a week past the agreed upon payment date, and I’m getting radio silence. 

This was the biggest transaction to date, by a lot. So I’m starting to get a little worried, and say as much when I notice my texts are green. We both have iPhones. I know it doesn’t automatically mean that I’m blocked if my texts are green, but one can imagine how I’d be worried about that at this point.

I give up and kinda write it off when she finally responds with this long story about being in the hospital. She pays me and I feel bad for doubting. 

Then another job where she needs me to work with her in terms of payment, and I do. It takes her longer to pay, but I can’t argue when she asks “when have I never paid you?” —she’s always paid me (but rarely on time). It’s just that her uncle died this time and she can’t believe how not understanding I’m being. 

Then a couple days ago I do another job (I know, regardless of whether I’m an asshole, I’m certainly a dumbass for continuing to do these jobs) and she says she’ll pay the next morning. She doesn’t. Her grandma died and would I please just be nice? 

I told her “sorry to hear that” and she called me out for being insincere. And it was insincere because, frankly, I didn’t believe her. And I’m a pretty trusting, naive person. I couldn’t believe it though. What were the odds that nearly every time she owes money, a loved one dies? And regardless, I don’t see how that affects her ability to pay me. It’s not like she’s paying for the funeral.

But I’m painted as the bad guy here because I told her I still expect to be paid and that she could have paid me in the time it took to call me out.

It turns out her grandma really did die, and I quickly apologized and offered my sincere condolences, etc…should I have needed proof? Idk. 

But again I can’t help but feel this shouldn’t prevent her from paying for services already provided.

I think that she is just trying to buy time or piss me off to where I say something mean enough to where she can justify not paying me in her head.

132,1c97fuk,AITA for saying I’m unavailable after getting volunteered for something?,"My son is on a player pitch baseball team. He’s 10. Coach sent a text last night to all the parents giving assigned dates for parents to run the concession stand and provide a crock pot meal during the season. 

My assigned date was a day I can’t make. For context, I’m a single mom and a nurse who works all sorts of bizarre hours to balance my time with my kids between when they’re with their dad (who lives in the same town and we do 50/50 and are very amicable.)

I initially was surprised to see that I was committed to something that, to me, feels very overwhelming. I work long hours on the days they’re with their dad so I can be home on days they’re with me. I am struggling to stay on top of my day to day life sometimes. I’m burnt out but my kids deserve the chance to have their own hobbies so here we are. 

The idea of having to plan, prep and cook a meal and be managing a concession during a game that is important to me is really upsetting and has been causing me a lot of strife.

I don’t get to go to all of my son’s games - because I work every other weekend in order to keep my commitment and get benefits. I’m lucky if I’ll make half the games. I’m a very present mom and missing games is hard. When I can make the games, I want to be available and engaged. Watching him play and him knowing I’m paying attention is something that’s important to me. 

I love my job, despite the schedule which can be stressful, is also flexible in many other ways that are helpful to me in this stage of life. 

I messaged the coach to basically say that while I care about the team and don’t want to be unsupportive, that I cannot be committed to helping in that way. If other opportunities to help came up and I could help then I would gladly volunteer. He basically told me he would switch the weekend to one I would be at a game so I could help. 

AITA for refusing to commit to this task?

133,1c96wyb,AITA for not going to my friend’s bachelorette party for my dad’s retirement party?,"I was invited to my friend’s bachelorette party a few months ago and was so excited because she’s one of my favorite people (I’m not a bridesmaid but was honored to be invited anyway). I already committed and paid for my lodging stay. 

I found out today that my dad’s retirement party is that same weekend on a Sunday, and I was planning to go from the bachelorette party on Saturday afternoon to my dad’s retirement party, until I found out they are 7 hours apart and I can absolutely not make that work. I’m thinking of not going to my friend’s bachelorette party (which I was really looking forward to). I would tell the bachelorette party planner to keep my lodging fee ($300) just to make it easier and not inconvenience her/the other 10 girls attending.  

FYI, my dad’s retirement party is kind of a big deal in the community he is in. It’s not like a finance guy, but more of a community service lifetime achievement. I know it would mean a lot to him if I went, even though he’s a man of few words, and the party will probably only be a few hours. 

For reference - I live 3 hours from the bachelorette party, and live 5 hours from my dad’s retirement party, so hypothetically if I drove 7 hours to get to the retirement party from the bachelorette party, I’d be driving 5 hours back home the next day, in addition to the 3 hours the first day to get to the bachelorette party. I would also only be able to go to the bachelorette party Friday night, and leave at noon on Saturday at the latest. 

I also already checked flights, and it would be a few hours to get to the nearest airport from the bachelorette party, so that wouldn’t work either.

Fast forward to when I started editing, and I sent a clip for them asking for Their opinions. Some of them said that was not what they expected and that I made them look weird.

They asked for me to change it and I said “no, slideshows are boring.” But I did go back and change it, when I was about to send it to the group, I saw that they have been saying a things about me and the video, so I got angry and said that I wasn’t going to do it again. 

The next day at school, a girl asked me why I wasn’t doing it again and said I should listen to them because it’s not my thing it’s what the class wants. I told her that I could do what they wanted and use the first video as an intro because mostly everyone else wanted me to do it as a film. 

But she still didn’t listen and then started talking loud so everyone could hear, I said I wasn’t going to be there and wouldn’t do it , so she got even more angry and walked off with her sister.
I felt guilty when I got home, so I was about to apologize to everyone but remembered that they all started to gang up on me and talked about me. Then Saturday morning one of my classmates started to begging me to do it because she said the slideshow would be boring. 

I told her no unless I got an apology, she agreed and asked the others to apologize and they said not Untill I do first because I was being selfish. They said I wanted to do it my way, even though I said I’d do both because a lot of other classmates said that they preferred my own than the slideshow, they said it was boring when they saw it.
I was very angry but still apologized first. One of the persons who I wanted it from apologized but the last one said that they didn’t do anything wrong and refused. Fast forward to when everyone was arguing and someone said that I was planning on doing the video with my original film and the slideshow so everyone could be happy. 
The person who didn’t want to apologize to me said that I should have just said that instead, even if that was one of the first things I said after they gave me their opinions so that everyone could be happy. Another student had to tell her that I did  and another just jumped and said that I probably didn’t say it clearly because she didn’t understand.

136,1c96oc7,WIBTA if i didnt invite them to my birthday dinner?,"So i (19F) am turning 20 in about a week and a bit, and im planning on just having a little dinner with some close friends of mine. But right now im just having a bit of a dilemma about who i want to invite.

So far i am for sure inviting 5 people, but im unsure about the 3 that are one my mind. Basically me and the 3 people were super close  in 1st year, then comes 2nd year and they started to distance themselves from me and 2 other people, and then 3rd year we would talk and say how much we missed each other whenever we would bump into each other, but we never were the same. Its also worth mentioning the way they kinda ghosted me and our other 2 friends was really painful and took a toll on me which i had a drunken breakdown over, and my now closest friends consoled me and urged me to cut them off. 

So why am i even considering inviting them? I am a people pleaser and basically last november one of these 3 had a birthday, in which i was invited to, and looking back i probably shouldnt have gone. A couple months back i still felt some sort of attachment to them since i felt like they were my first friends abroad and i became emotionally attached. Anyway. Then fast forward to 2 weeks ago, i was again invited to another one of the 3’s birthday dinner. So somehow i kinda feel indebted to invite them to mine??? Idk on one hand i feel bad for not wanting to invite them even though they invited me, but then i feel like that would kind of give mixed signals since i did show up to the other birthdays. So would i be the asshole if i didnt invite them?

Our mom is a CEO of a steadily growing IT company. She’s busy all the time and she has been busy for as long as can remember.

When my sister was having trouble she’d also go to our mom but I’d be there too because I never left her side. 

We got into an argument today while I was staying at her apartment. She was drunk and was calling me a sociopath to which I said that’s not true. I told her that I’m not sociopath I just have my own problems and I go to mom for them. She said that I always steal all my mom’s attention and that’s why she’s so closed off with people, that’s why she’s single she says.

139,1c96dak,AITA for saying that my dad caused my mental issues?,"I've posted about problems with my dad previously, but for some backstory, my dad abandoned me as a baby. I'm unsure of the exact timeline of things, but he got my mother pregnant, left her, got married, she had me, he got divorced at some point, and then my mother was deemed unfit to take care of me by CPS so I was put into foster care. He didn't think he could care for a child, he wanted nothing to do with me. My grandma (his mom) came and got me from foster care. He quickly signed over parental rights so she could adopt me, as did my mom. 

My mom had her fair share of mental issues too, she was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, she dealt with addiction, was in and out of various mental hospitals her whole life, and had bad postpartum depression. I haven't seen her since I was four. Most of what I know about my mom I've learned from my grandma. I don't blame my mom for leaving me as she didn't have much of a choice. My dad has never been diagnosed with anything as he refuses to see a doctor.

My dad has been in my life off and on. I find this to be more damaging than just being completely absent. Up until recently, my dad has seen me once a year for 3-4 days at a time. He lived pretty far away. During that time, he would try to ""parent"" me around.

Added to all this, I went through a string of bad relationships at a young age, many being various forms of abusive. 

On my 16th birthday my dad sent me a letter. It talked about all the issues he went through like he said he had depression, the fact that when I was in foster care he had a job and was in school and didn't think he could take care of a child while still reaching his goal of becoming a lawyer. I just found it to be a bunch of excuses really. My therapist agrees.

As of about a year ago I was diagnosed with several things, being Borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and c-ptsd. 

The issue came up when I was talking to my grandma and I made the comment that my dad basically caused most if not all of my mental issues (ik bipolar disorder is genetic, I don't count that one). Everything else can all be linked back to being abandoned by him as a child and the repeated trauma that having him in my life has done to me. My grandma of course got very upset at me and said I just blame my dad for everything.

She also told her brother that I peaked as an athlete in HS. Her family is extremely into spots. I told her I loved how passionate she was about playing volleyball and she loved it so of course she talks about it a lot.

I invite them to my house often times for movie/food/games, and laugh all day simply enjoying with stuff we like to do.   It all started to crumble when I found out that they were actually planning on a trip, which I wasn’t invited to. I knew that because they were discussing on the group chat about finalizing their route to take, which meant they already planned it way ahead before texting on the chat. I felt incredibly hurt, even betrayed. I thought that I was 
part of all activities with them. 
I voiced out to them how hurt I was that I wasn’t included in the plans, which one of them responded that of ourse I can go if I want to but I shouldn’t be upset if I’m not always updated on the plans, and was told that overreacted too much and should stop blaming them for my hurting feelings. At this point I was beyond hurt and ended up becoming angry and because I was too overwhelmed with the pain, I lashed out and called them fake friends. One stood me up telling me that the world doesn’t revolve around me and that I was too much of an emotional mess. No matter how much I expressed that I just simple wanted to be included I was just being seen as selfish and self centered. I thought that maybe it’s because I called them fake friends, which I didn’t really mean it, i was just upset that i ended up saying it.

I owned up to my mistake and apologized to them, I even got them apology gifts. They said it’s all good and are glad that I calmed down. Only to find out that they still went through the trip without me. I got hurt again but no longer lashed it out since I didn’t want to do the same mistake. But all I wanted was to be included because I thought I was their friend.
I understand that I can be too emotional when I’m hurt, maybe that’s why they don’t like me and excluded me.

I felt incredibly hurt, even betrayed. I thought that I was 
part of all activities with them. 
I voiced out to them how hurt I was that I wasn’t included in the plans, which one of them responded that of ourse I can go if I want to but I shouldn’t be upset if I’m not always updated on the plans, and was told that overreacted too much and should stop blaming them for my hurting feelings. At this point I was beyond hurt and ended up becoming angry and because I was too overwhelmed with the pain, I lashed out and called them fake friends. One stood me up telling me that the world doesn’t revolve around me and that I was too much of an emotional mess. No matter how much I expressed that I just simple wanted to be included I was just being seen as selfish and self centered. I thought that maybe it’s because I called them fake friends, which I didn’t really mean it, i was just upset that i ended up saying it.

I owned up to my mistake and apologized to them, I even got them apology gifts. They said it’s all good and are glad that I calmed down. Only to find out that they still went through the trip without me. I got hurt again but no longer lashed it out since I didn’t want to do the same mistake. But all I wanted was to be included because I thought I was their friend.
I understand that I can be too emotional when I’m hurt, maybe that’s why they don’t like me and excluded me. Whatever the case, I cut all ties with them especially since later I found out that two people were talking behind my back about how annoying I am for being too emotional.",0.0,1.0538193,1,0
143,1c95npe,WIBTA if I Refused to Go to my Brother in Law's Wedding?,"My (31f) husband (26m) has an older brother (28m), I'll call BL, who is getting married in a few weeks to a lovely woman (25f), I'll call SL, who has become a pretty good friend since I married into the family last year. They've been together for 6 years and have always seemed really happy.

The four of us had dinner together a couple of days ago and after the main meal my husband brought out a pie that he had baked for the occasion. SL took one look at it and excused herself saying she was on a diet. In solidarity I also refused figuring I could always snag a piece later anyway and us ladies retired to the living room to watch tv while the guys had their pie. 

About 20min later BL comes out and tells us that they're leaving, NOW. and insists that SL get her shoes on and go. After that I asked my husband what happend and he told me that BL was making SL diet because he thought I was a bad influence on her since I'm plus size (I'm a big girl just under 300lbs), and I usually eat what I want. Husband said that BL had said that if SL ballooned up like me they were done and husband had responded that he was being cruel and unreasonable and that was when BL stormed out. 

So WIBTA if I told SL that I wouldn't come to the wedding because I don't like that BL thinks I'm a bad influence for being fat?

144,1c95egy,AITA for calling my bf arrogant,"AITA I (31 F) have recently began dating this man (36 M) for a few weeks now. I have started to notice a few things that i don’t like (i don’t know if i am being overly critical). For example every time he goes to the gym which is a lot he sends me and posts gym selfies looking for me to vaildate him every time  and talks about all the praise he gets from others. Another time i we were taking about social media, i only accept people i know and said so does he i pointed out he had over 400 people and he responded saying he knew well over 400 people because he is so popular. He constantly calls himself a geezer for example how do you feel being with a geezer. 

the problem came as i am currently studying and he keeps going on and on about how he got his bachelors and wants to have it in his title when letters are addressed to him and on social media ( which i thought was odd as i know people with same degree who do not do this), tonight i am trying to study and he starts trying to explain to me what i am suppose to do (he study something compeltly different from me) and i said to him thats not what i am doing. He then starts talking about how he learned psychics and about human senses once again nothing related. I try to change the subject so he starts talking about how much money he spends on clothes and how only expensive clothes make people feel good about themselves. I told him i disagree and he said all girls shop in primark. I told him he sounded arrogant and vain and he said thats my preception and i said i felt he spoke down to me. He told me that is just how i see it and because he never said i wear cheap clothes means i am wrong. I tried to explain its not what he said it was his attitude. He said he has worked hard to get where he is and i just tore it down in ten minutes and he left angry. So AITA

one of the people, who i'll call B, told A she should have talked to us before adding the acquaintance. she was still uncomfortable, and brought up that both i and A had done this sort of thing before. she was referring to a time when she removed all of us and added only some of us back, excluding 3 people. i got confused as to why she did this and talked to those people, who said they were ok with/wanted to be in the group. i added them back, and B said she removed them because they barely talk, which is kind of true. however, i thought it would confuse them if they suddenly were removed with no explanation. B got mad and said that they might ""take it the wrong way"" but she was the one who removed them without asking? anyways, we resolved it and it wasn't an issue for a while.

now, when she said that A and i have done this sort of thing before, i got confused. i was only adding people back that she removed. when A and i told her that, she got mad and said that she removed us all. this didn't make sense as an argument because she added us back, except them, which is the same as keeping us and removing them. she got really angry and called me a fucking dumbass. when A said that it was a fact that she removed them, she called us annoying, said she already explained everything, said good bye and left. i feel bad and think me and A may have gone a little far, but A reassures me that we were simply stating the facts.

146,1c951rw,AITA for asking my MIL to fly home after all of her help?,"Posting anon for a reason.

My husband (early 40’s) suffered a major medical emergency about four months ago. At the time it occurred his mother, my mother-in-law, flew out to our side of the country to help with his care. Early on, her help presence was invaluable. She is a retired ICU nurse, I have no medical background. 

My partner could hardly move and couldn’t speak for weeks. He was in inpatient rehabilitation but now is home. This is where the issues with my MIL became more significant. Previously she wanted to stay in a hotel to not “overstay her welcome” in our home, her words. Since my partner’s release home she has been staying in our guest room, which I initially agreed was good. My husband is still recovering, needs significant assistance, and has many outpatient appointments.

Now out of the hospital she’s began commenting to me that she knew the real reason, since doctors couldn’t give me any reason why it occurred. Then went down an anti-vax conspiracy rabbit hole about how the pandemic was bioterrorism to get us all in to get vaxed. She told me, before she retired, ALL her patients had received it before having the same condition. I told her that’s correlation, not causation. The elderly were both likely to have both, but one isn’t caused by the other. She said even some healthy adults. I said it is still correlation. I wanted to scream, aren’t you a nurse?? I didn’t. 

I also learned she’s been putting essential oils on my husband’s affected left side. He was developing a rash but he wasn’t sure why either, and he has trouble remembering anything to do with his left side. Finally saw her applying them and she said they’re for nerve growth. I said he’s clearly developing a rash to them, you need to stop, she said that’s a sign of inflammatory modulators coming to the site to regrow his nerves. Again, I’m no doctor, but the nerves in his arm are find it’s his brain that is damaged. 

This was it for me. I told her that night I was grateful for her help but she should go home now and be with the rest of the family. She was adamant there was still too much here to do. I finally had to tell her, I feel she is now detrimental to my partner’s health and I need her to leave. She opted to go to a hotel, she was in tears, and she left on the earliest flight she could. She has since posted to FaceBook that her son-in-law (myself) has verbally attacked her and barred her from using her 35+ year career as an ICU nurse to help her only son recover. I’ve received actual death threats from his side of the family. I’m shocked. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,"AITA for asking my MIL to fly home after all of her help? Posting anon for a reason.
