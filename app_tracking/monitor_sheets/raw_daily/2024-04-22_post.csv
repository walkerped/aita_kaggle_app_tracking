0,1capw3x,AITA for wanting to meet my friends?,"Me (M20) and my GF (F19) have been in a long distance relationship for 1,5 years. I live in Germany and she lives in Canada, so there's a 7 hour time difference between us. And even at that we spend A LOT of time together, we are always on call with one another, always texting each other(longest we'll go without a text is max 30 min), we are able to play for 1-3 hours every night, including spending every weekend together.

Even from the very start she always seemed to get upset whenever I would plan something with my friends, choosing to either ignore me when I brough it up, or get very ""needy"" when I actually went, requiring me to always be on my phone.

Some time in the middle of 2023 she more or less put a ban on me meeting my friends after I went out with a friend to smoke weed at a time when she was ignoring me completely, stating that I was ""ruining the plans she had made for us that night"". After that incident any mention of me meeting my friends was immediately shut down. I was only able to meet my friends 4 times in 2023.

I've only now been able to meet my friend again, but under some very extreme rules. I cannot go meet them any time she has off, that includes her having the day/weekend off, if she is available to call while she's at work,  basically any chance of interacting with her she should take priority. She goes to work pretty late, so by the time she is busy(if she can't call at work) it's already very late for me and a lot of meeting opportunities have already passed.

Under her ""rules"" there is basically zero opportunity to meet my friends, as they usually only have the weekends off. 

To me we are spending basically every waking moment possible together, so on the rare off chance that my friends can meet, I don't see the issue in me going, even if that means she will have to find else to do that weekend.

Keeping a good relationship wth my friends is very important to me.

1,1captqh,AITA for telling my mom I can’t listen to stories of her partner’s abuse?,"My mother, aged 51, has been trying to get out of an abusive relationship for the last year. I am proud of the progress she has made and she is currently in the final steps of breaking ties with her partner. That being said, this has been a hell of a year. My mother has, at times, been homeless. She has lived with myself and my sister for periods of time, and we have supported her financially. Generally, she has deeply struggled with coping with what has happened to her. Luckily, she has been able to start seeing a therapist, which I think has helped her a lot in making the decision to finally leave her partner.

For more context about my mom, she was severely abused as a child, had both me and my sister at a young age, has struggled with prescription pain med use, and has been a more chaotic than stable presence in our lives. She can be incredibly melodramatic; she often seeks attention through her struggles/illnesses and has been known to lie about them. She is the perfect example of the phrase ‘misery loves company’. (To be clear, I know she is not being dramatic or lying about the abuse.)

After a childhood of being my mother’s emotional rock/support system, our emotions have become very entwined. Basically, I spent my childhood worrying about her constantly, and I can’t stop as an adult. There is no one that can make me more anxious or neurotic than her. Speaking with her, especially when she is having a breakdown, is incredibly emotionally draining. She has always had trouble controlling her emotions. She is incredibly reactive and can mostly only think in black and white. She also is a person who will wallow in her suffering. I often have panic attacks after speaking with her and have had to seek therapy to help with our relationship.

Yesterday, my mom called me and told me about a recent altercation that had occurred between her and her partner. I let her talk for ~35 min about very explicit descriptions of abuse, her self-hate, and other very fatalistic topics. Finally, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and told her that I can’t listen to this stuff anymore. Of course, she took this very poorly and told me I don’t care about her. The thing is that I deeply care about her, but I can’t handle being her child and therapist, especially for such intense issues. I don’t know how to tell her that I’m here for her but I can’t handle everything she throws my way.

Am I the asshole, or in this case, just a bad son for setting a boundary in this scenario?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,"AITA for telling my mom I can’t listen to stories of her partner’s abuse?

3,1capn3z,AITA for limiting my roommate’s freedom?,"I (18 y/o female) have had tension with my college roommate since day one. We barely talk to each other and primarily communicate through text. Although I was upset by this initially, I got over it and accepted that she was going to be someone  only had to live with for a year. However, as the year went on, more and more little things began piling up, most regarding our differing sleep schedules. 

I am a morning person while she is a night owl. I have no problem with this, my one request is she does not disturb me while I am asleep as I do for her when I wake up early. I am aware that I am very sensitive to any noise or light when going to sleep and use a sleep mask and sound machine. I have been forced to purchase 2 new sound machines as she claims the noise keeps her up (soft rain sounds) and I now rely on a headband that plays sound but is not noise cancelling. 

The noises include letting the door slam in the middle of the night and in the rare mornings I sleep in, making coffee at two in the morning, slamming her drawers, blow drying her hair, typing on her laptop and making phone calls on speaker. I am not a confrontational person and rarely bring these topics up, but when I have (which has been quite a few recently) she somehow twists it on me or claims it is not her fault. For the door, she claimed it was industrial and no way to stop it from slamming. For her coffee she said it was her machine and she had a right to use it whenever she wanted. When she blow dried her hair (after I asked her to do it in the bathroom) she said she only dried the ends.

She has gone on to claim that there is a lot she has given up for me, including “rarely having her friends in the room” not being able to let her friends hang out in the room late at night when I am sleeping, and then claimed that she didn’t like me saying she slams the door because it makes her sound aggressive.

I get up early simply because I have early classes and work out in the morning and am as quiet as possible.

I feel as though I have done everything she has asked of me these past few months and feel somewhat guilty for limiting her freedom so I have to ask Reddit, AITA?

4,1caplpe,AITA For asking my roommate for my bench back that I had to leave for a bit when I moved out?,"I moved out of my apartment where I sublet for 2 years, about a month ago. I had discussed with my roommate (who I subleased from) that I would not be taking my desk and that the new roommate could have it if they wanted it and it was a part of the FB listing for the room. There was also a bench and chair that I had made arrangements with friends to come get after I had already left. I was moving out of state and they couldn’t fit in my car. Chair was picked up but the bench wasn’t going to be able to be picked up for a few weeks as my friend was out of the country but the roommate understood that (at the time). 

When I texted asking if anyone would be home so that my friend could  finally pick up my bench, I was met with deference as ‘so much time has passed’, ‘I can’t ask the new roommate on such short notice’, and from the new roomie- ‘I need more of a heads up since I’m using it’.  Also that I had apparently left it with no intention of picking it up (I had multiple friends who knew I was coming back as well as text threads with friends  if they would be able to pick it up), but that my friend could come pick up the desk. While it had been a few weeks since I had moved out and had thought it could be picked up by, I had also not anticipated my roommate giving it to the new roommate or that it would even be an issue as it’s a small 3’ foot Ikea wooden bench that I was attached to. I hadn’t even said anything about the delay in getting my security deposit back (about 45 days  after I moved out).

I was able to have my friend pick it up last week after speaking directly to the new roommate and arranging ample time for her to move her stuff. She then sent a link with another bench as we had spoken about me helping her find a replacement. I had assumed that meant find a similar option. When I never responded, as she expected me to spend $75+ on a bench for her, she sent a whole paragraph about how inconvenienced she was by this and if I wasn’t going to help her that I just needed to let her know. I responded back that this whole thing was a miscommunication and that I didn’t feel as if I was responsible for replacing something that wasn’t supposed to be hers in the first place. She then responded back that it was unfair that she was told it was up for grabs and suddenly taken away and it was unfair, that I had used her room for storage, and that its wild for her to have to replace the whole thing on her own. She then called me extremely rude and inconsiderate to leave her hanging like this. I understand being told one thing and something else happens, but the OG roommate misunderstood and now I am getting heat for this.

8,1cap54m,WIBTA if I didn’t let my dad do “father things” at my wedding and excluding 2 siblings,"Update: We have only been reconnecting for 3 months now. I am in no way trying to hurt anyone but I feel as though  my father hasn’t lived up to his role and want my grandpa to walk me down the isle as he stepped up when my father let me down. Also I have never once met my dads step daughter or my half sister because his wife won’t let me. I have seen her a few times when picking my brother up and she is nothing but rude to me, my sister and my mom. She has flat out told me that she hates me and wishes my dad would just leave all 3 of us behind. She even hates that my brother still goes there as “he takes time away from the family”. I do not wish to hurt my siblings feelings as I understand they are just kids and none of this is their fault. But Is it really fair for me to invite people I have never met (or been allowed to meet and trust me I have tried many times) to my wedding especially when trying to keep it small and already not inviting some people to keep with our limit? Especially when one is so young and won’t remember? I have tried to ask about going over to meet them and my dads wife threatened to call the cops saying I was trespassing. I have also offered to take them out for the day to hangout and get to know each other and again that was not an option

I (19F) am engaged to my fiancé (21M) and we are trying to plan our wedding. We have decided that we want a small child free wedding, but will make an acception for our siblings (14M, 15F, 15M and 16F).
The issue is that my father and I have been estranged for over 7 years now because he was an abusive father so my sister and I cut him out of our lives. My brother is the only one who stayed in contact with him. I recently purchased a home that’s a fixer upper and my brother told my dad. My dads dream was always to buy a fixer upper and make it his own home, so he decided he wanted to help with the house. I reluctantly let him as I did not want to have anything to do with him at first. Our relationship has slowly improved but not into a “father daughter relationship” if that makes sense.
Now while planning the wedding, I have decided I want my grandpa to walk me down the isle and do the father daughter dance with me. He was the one who was always there for me and he was my “father figure” growing up. My brother found out and thinks it’s unfair to my dad as we’ve been reconnecting. The next thing is that my father has a “new family” with a step daughter (10F), daughter (4months) and a new baby on the way. Even though we made an exception for my siblings I don’t see these siblings as my “siblings” and so I do not plan on inviting them as well as his new wife as we have never gotten along, she hates me and I’m fine with that.

I am in no way trying to hurt anyone but I feel as though  my father hasn’t lived up to his role and want my grandpa to walk me down the isle as he stepped up when my father let me down. Also I have never once met my dads step daughter or my half sister because his wife won’t let me. I have seen her a few times when picking my brother up and she is nothing but rude to me, my sister and my mom. She has flat out told me that she hates me and wishes my dad would just leave all 3 of us behind. She even hates that my brother still goes there as “he takes time away from the family”. I do not wish to hurt my siblings feelings as I understand they are just kids and none of this is their fault. But Is it really fair for me to invite people I have never met (or been allowed to meet and trust me I have tried many times) to my wedding especially when trying to keep it small and already not inviting some people to keep with our limit? Especially when one is so young and won’t remember? I have tried to ask about going over to meet them and my dads wife threatened to call the cops saying I was trespassing. I have also offered to take them out for the day to hangout and get to know each other and again that was not an option

I (19F) am engaged to my fiancé (21M) and we are trying to plan our wedding. We have decided that we want a small child free wedding, but will make an acception for our siblings (14M, 15F, 15M and 16F).
The issue is that my father and I have been estranged for over 7 years now because he was an abusive father so my sister and I cut him out of our lives.

9,1cap4eo,AITA for calling my wife overdramatic and saying she’s being ableist?,"  
  
My wife (40F) and I (40M) have 3 kids, our youngest is James (13M).  
  
James is autistic, he’s a very smart kid and struggled socially in pre-k and kindergarten, so in 1st grade, we moved him to a private K-8 school that had more resources for neurodivergent students, but there were some issues going on at that school, so we had to move him to a public school at the beginning of this school year (8th grade). My wife and I were worried at first but he’s been doing really well.   
  
James’s special interests are sports and he’s become close with the boys on the baseball team. The boys are really defensive of him and have helped him to grow, like encouraging him to try umpiring games for little kids.  
  
There’s also another boy in this friend group who’s not on the team, this boy is transgender. Again, the group is VERY defensive of this boy.  
  
One of the boys on the baseball team, Paxton (13M) has a younger brother Ned (12M). I’ve met the parents of Ned and Paxton at some games and they’ve always seemed like nice people, Ned sometimes comes to the games even if he doesn’t want to, he’s a quiet, nerdy kid and I didn’t ever think he could’ve been a bully. Ned is in 7th grade.  
  
Last week, Ned called a boy in his grade who was trans a slur (different boy than in the friend group). Paxton heard about this during lunch and in the passing period after lunch, he went looking for Ned in the hallway. He found Ned and started screaming curse words at him. He was trying to “shame” his brother. Nothing got physical, and a teacher stopped the argument and sent both of them to the office, where apparently he said he wanted to make Ned’s life “hell”.  
  
Originally Paxton was going to be suspended for a few days, but after pointing out he’s never got in trouble before, his punishment was reduced to 3 days of after school detention. Ned got suspended for a few days given prior bad behavior.  
  
Last night, the boys were at our house working on some homework. My wife and I started talking to the boys and they were telling us about the story, Paxton was also grounded by his parents, so this was the first time we saw him since the incident. He was sharing a bracelet he got from a “detention regular” that said “straight outta detention”. He was saying he would do it again and that “detention isn’t that bad when you know you stood up for what’s right”.  
  
Paxton is a very sweet boy, these boys hug each other when they’re down and Paxton does volunteer work for National Junior Honor Society, Paxton has never acted like a “bad boy”.  
  
After the boys left, my wife told me she thought Paxton shouldn't hang out with James because bragging about detention would makes him look like “he wants to be a hoodlum” (just in case people ask, all the boys are white and well off, including our son and Paxton) and that James was “impressionable” because of his autism. I said she was overreacting and even sounded ableist. She’s very upset at me. AITA?",Not the A-hole POO Mode,2024-04-22,"AITA for calling my wife overdramatic and saying she’s being ableist?

When we got him, he was over a year old, house trained & very well behaved. The 3 we've accrued over the past 4 years were my husband & my daughter's doing, despite me telling them no. Ever since the other dogs have been brought in, my house has been destroyed. The 3 are all high energy & get destructive when bored. One has a habit of refusing to use the bathroom when she's let outside & then pee & poop in the house. Since he brought the girls home our boys decided to start marking the furniture. So we've gone through 4 couches so far b/c they shredded them & peed on them. We just got a new couch and the boys have already peed on it once & the girls have tried to tear apart the cushions. Our baseboards, doors & stairs are chewed up & anything that was ever left in their reach has been destroyed.

My husband & daughter don'tt clean up after or take care of them. If the dogs poop or puke, I have to clean it. They shed everywhere so I'm constantly having to vacuum & constantly mop from the mud they track in. Their solution to everything is to crate them when someone is not with them to watch them, but if we did that then they would be out of their crate maybe 1-2 hours a day. That is not a life.

We had 32 chickens at our old house that we had to rehome when we moved into town b/c our city doesn't allow livestock. He brought home 3 cows that needed to be bottle fed but we work full time so it wasn't possible. He brought home 12 freshly hatched turkeys while in our current home.

He bought a skunk on a whim that I also took care of. We had him for 4 months until he bragged to the wrong person & the game warden was called b/c it's illegal to own them where we live.

They refuse to help or train the dogs & I'm sick of constantly having to clean up after these dogs along with all the other housework. I'm tired of my house and furniture being destroyed.

We don’t have an exact date, but we usually pick a week in June or July when it is warm, and fly/drive to our hometown for bottomless brunch at our favorite spot. Keep in mind that for some of us, this is the only time of the year that we see each other. I, in particular, live 2500 miles away, so I hardly see any of these girls. Regardless, it is always a good time, until recently when one of my friends “Rue” would not stop commenting on my food intake.

For some background, I am and always have been a very active person. I ran track and cross country for our college and I now compete in ultramarathons. For this reason, I eat a lot of calories, and I stay pretty thin. I also eat reasonably healthy, balanced meals most of the time. However, for the one day a year at our favorite restaurant, NOTHING is off limits. I eat plate after heaping plate of cheesy eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, bacon–literally I could eat the entire menu.

Rue has always been on the heavier side.

This really bothered me in part because it completely invalidated the work I do to maintain my healthy body, but also because I could tell Rue was frustrated with her weight, and I felt my friends were doing more harm than good.

I explained that I do not normally eat like this, and I also exercise very frequently, and that people shouldn’t look at a snapshot of someone’s life and think that’s how they live on the daily. I also said eating salads for every meal and never enjoying a meal out with friends is just going to make her more frustrated, which will slow her progress.

At around 12 midnight. A group of 3 or 4 had walked to the end. It was dark. No light at the end of the pier. At the same time my friend on the left was rebaiting. We exchanged pleasantries with the group and they took the bench on the left were my friend was sitting and started setting up. Shortly after another group of four walked down male, female, 1 teenager, and a large dog. Nothing was said when they arrived. Im on the right side fishing when i hear my takle box being closed over on the left side of the pier. I look over and can see the male of the second group closing it. I say out to him ""Id appreciate it if you did not touch my things"". 
His responce, ""I closed it because it looked like it was falling out. Then you barked at me so now im barking back.""
Me ""it wasn't falling out they had been here all day and never moved. If you wanted the spot to sit you could just have just asked if this belongs to anyone and i would have said it was mine and moved it.""
The male ""I'm dont know why your are making a big deal and antagonizing us we are just trying to fish.""
I then relent put my takle box and bait box near me on the other right side. I then realized that i left an item on the left side and get up to go get it. As I reach down to grap the item their dog lunges at me and starts barking. I say to the male.
""Wow, sir you may want to have better control of your dog. My dogs at home dont bark like that at random people if they approach me.""
The male ""well maybe thats because your dog is a pussy""
I dont respond and my friend tells me to calm down and that we should leave as we have a lot of fish to clean anyway. 
We decide to leave.

So I broke my fingers last week, leading to me going into the emergency room for 8 hours. This was a hard time for me, because the doctor told me that I might need surgery to put pins in my fingers. I was sad because I had a competition in 2 weeks and a show for theater a day after. I cried hard. And during this my mother got a call from my father. My mom came back into the room and sat by my side, A few minutes later, saying that my sister and my father sorry for me. I later found out that this was false. I came home and immediately flopped onto the couch from a shocking day. The next day my parents went shopping and my sister came up to me and said “You seriously had to get hurt? Are you that SELFISH?” She stormed off to her room and I was left in shock. We have never had an amazing relationship though this had made me feel as if our sistership was terribly tarnished. She has yet to bring the conversation up though.

When I told my parents later that night they brushed it off as non important and I should think about how she must be feeling. I hated my parents and said this was kind of like me being jealous of her being hard of hearing. They said this wasn’t the same and I agreed but like her it wasn’t something I could help right now.

I got to a small public school. Most people who go to college go to state schools. 

There’s a girl in my class, Sam, who’s pretty smart. Her family is not from here, and one of her parents attended an Ivy League school where she has two relatives who are professors, and her other parent also attended a very prestigious school. 

Today was our college decision day, and Sam was wearing a shirt for the school her parent attended. A teacher in one of our classes asked her about it, saying “it’s not too often that someone from here goes to [that school]”. 

Sam is smart, but she also had an advantage to get in. I responded with “it’s not too often someone here is so connected with [that school]” as a lighthearted joke. Sam got annoyed and told me that I was being rude. Her friend told me I was downplaying her achievements because I was jealous(which I wasn’t). 

Our teacher had to tell people to move on. I didn’t mean it in a rude way, just that it was easier for Sam to be accepted than the average person.

Hi. I'm 53m, retired Air Force. Served 27 years and am thankful for the opportunities I was given, but very subdued about my service.

Recently, my GF wanted me to get her friends free minor league baseball tickets for military appreciation night. I told her, I'd be glad to go. I'll buy our tickets and her friends can buy theirs.

As I said, I was blessed to have a wonderful career and nice retirement (save for the 37% my ex-wife gets of it). I believe I benefited greatly from my time in and just feel wrong continuing to benefit. I'm not a ""do you have a military discount"" person. I don't stand at events asking military members and vets to stand for recognition. But if I'm asked if I served for reasons of discount, I will say, ""I'm retired. My days of discount are done. I greatly appreciate the offer.""

So, when asked to use my retired military status to benefit myself and others, it just sits wrong with me. My GF is very irritated with me, but this is a weird integrity and humility issue for me.

I am currently living with my parents because we live in 2024 and it's expensive to live alone.

   I try really hard to keep my clothes and my siblings' clothes separate, but sometimes I'll leave a shirt or a pair of pants in the bathroom after a shower. My sibling enjoys my style and likes to copy my outfits, which is fine. The issue is that they will purposefully steal my clothes out of the bathroom or from the laundry and wear them. I've told them several times not to wear my clothes, but they continue to wear them.

   Today set me off because I found them sitting in their little pool in our backyard wearing one of my new shirts. I had JUST worn it yesterday and forgot to grab it out of the bathroom last night when I showered. So not only did they wear my new shirt into nasty pool water, but they also wore my dirty shirt all day. When I told them it was my shirt, they lied and said they didn't know it was mine and that it was hanging in their closet. I know they're a kid but it made me so angry that they wore my shirt, lied about it, and then when I told them it upset me that they wore it they told me to get over it and that it didn't matter. So, AITA for getting mad at them for wearing my shirt, or am I just overreacting? 

Edit: I see a lot of comments about me making sure I clean up after myself, which is very valid, and I will do better in the future.

For a plethora of reasons, mainly for my own sanity, I won’t go into a crazy amount of detail on how it happened, but my mother committed mortgage fraud about 17 years ago. Now, that really should be none of my business because I was a child when this happened but lo and behold, she committed felony by buying a house in my name and then failing to make mortgage payments on it, or HOA payments, and getting multiple liens and a foreclosure in my name. 

It’s always been talked about, but I recently using the internet, found actual legitimate proof that this house was in my name. I immediately downloaded all the documents I could find, went onto the county website, and even found her signature, but in my name on lots of documents. My mom has super specific handwriting, so it was obvious it was her signature. 

I’ve kept all this for about two years now as kind of an ace up my sleeve if she did anything I couldn’t handle. As you can imagine, a woman that would buy an entire house in their child’s name, and lie about it for close to two decades is not a rational or nice person. 

Recently, i’ve gotten really close to paying off a massive car loan that is in my name and hers. This car loan was taken out when I was barely 18, for a stupid high percentage of interest, for a car that has quickly depreciated in value and that I don’t really like but that’s not relevant. since the car is in both of our names, she has been threatening to get it towed and take it back to the dealership If I don’t do what she asks of me. She’s threatened to report it stolen, to just go pick it up and take it with her because it’s legally half hers as well. It’s been a lot.  I’m truly considering letting her know that I have these documents and telling her to back off so I can have some peace back.

23,1camu1x,WIBTA for not letting my roommate have her “boyfriend” over at my house anymore because she won’t let him help me? ,"I (26F) have a roommate (26F) who I’ve known for over a decade and we are also now coworkers. She’s been here for about half a year and ever since she moved in she’s always had a boyfriend that stays over (practically lives at my house half of the days out of the week) which doesn’t bother me enough to say anything about, but at the end of the day it is another person being over at my house all the time. 

The issue that’s recently sparked up is that I messaged her and asked if he could help us take some things from the garage to the dump so we can clear it out since my garage is filled with both her and my stuff. In my head, he has a truck and is a guy, so he would be able to help move heavy things and usually guys love helping women with this kind of stuff so why not ask, right? 

She responds with “I’m not going to ask him to do that. He already does enough for me and it’s not his responsibility”. Now I’m not an unreasonable person. I understand that it isn’t technically his responsibility and I never insinuated that. I do feel like it’s a fair thing to ask of him since he stays over at my house rent free.  It makes me feel a bit uncomfortable and unliked/rejected having people live in my house who don’t think I’m worth helping with things. Yes, I plan on having a talk with her about this but I just wanted to get outside perspective to help me see if im being rational about this before I have the talk.


Edited for resolution: I asked a friend of an old friend if he would be able to help me move the furniture from my garage into my truck and unload to the dump. He said he’s happy to help and offered to use his truck since it’s bigger ☺️ I will be buying him lunch since he’s doing it during his lunch break. 

As for the roommate situation I have decided to stop expecting friendly favors and will discontinue being lenient on the amount of rent paid and will no longer tolerate late payments. 

Thankyou to all who helped me see where I was in the wrong and to the people who showed empathy toward me and were able to see my side of things as well.

I understand that it isn’t technically his responsibility and I never insinuated that. I do feel like it’s a fair thing to ask of him since he stays over at my house rent free.  It makes me feel a bit uncomfortable and unliked/rejected having people live in my house who don’t think I’m worth helping with things. Yes, I plan on having a talk with her about this but I just wanted to get outside perspective to help me see if im being rational about this before I have the talk.


Edited for resolution: I asked a friend of an old friend if he would be able to help me move the furniture from my garage into my truck and unload to the dump. He said he’s happy to help and offered to use his truck since it’s bigger ☺️ I will be buying him lunch since he’s doing it during his lunch break. 

As for the roommate situation I have decided to stop expecting friendly favors and will discontinue being lenient on the amount of rent paid and will no longer tolerate late payments. 

Thankyou to all who helped me see where I was in the wrong and to the people who showed empathy toward me and were able to see my side of things as well. ",3.0,1.0646975,1,0
24,1camisj,AITA for abusing my peer,"With a tight 7-day deadline and impending exams, our group of 5 faced pressure to complete a film assignment. I handled editing while YSSI, PMV, and HV managed filming, but PG struggled to find a role.   


After finishing the interviews, I sacrificed sleep to start editing. My frustration over PG's absence and contribution led to an impulsive threat to remove him from the group, sparking a confrontation. He acknowledged his shortcomings and agreed to contribute more, and I apologized for my outburst.  
  
On the second day, I incorporated feedback from the first cut and suggestions from PG into the second cut. After presenting it, the group recommended further changes for a third cut. Despite PG's suggestion to add his online b-roll, it was vetoed due to concerns about the instructor's preferences. As an alternative, I suggested he search for suitable music.  
  
By the fourth day, our final cut was nearly complete. With PMV unavailable, I collaborated with the rest to add BGM and integrate the opening montage. Unfortunately, the music PG sourced didn't match our tempo, so I adjusted it, though it still fell short. We settled on it temporarily.   


Despite forgetting an automated subtitle option, I volunteered to add them manually. PG made a sarcastic comment about my editing efforts, which briefly upset me. However, I later found the automated subtitle feature and shared the updated version. With everyone reluctantly agreeing on the BGM, we felt confident in our progress. PG also worked on a slideshow presentation, though it was considered the easiest task. We were 90% prepared to submit the project the following day.  
  
In the final hours, while away from campus, HV found potentially better background music (BGM), prompting a last-minute change. As I began exporting with the new music, YSSI reminded me to add outlines to the subtitles. However, my laptop started to die, making adjustments difficult. I managed to share the cut with the new BGM before my laptop died. As I traveled back, campus commitments weighed on my mind. However, the version without subtitles had already been submitted.  
  
Additionally, I received an email late at night about another eval for the next morning, requiring me to stay up for three more hours to prepare.  
  
As exhaustion mounted, frustration peaked. This led to a regrettable action on my part. I sent PG an abusive message, expressing frustrations about his lack of contribution. Despite warning him not to read it first, he did and was upset.  
  
We spoke for an hour, during which he threatened to report me. I encouraged him to do so. PG decided not to report me, citing his busy schedule.   


Instead, he asked me to delete and block his contact, which I agreed to do. Reflecting on our conversation, I realize he handled the situation maturely, which makes me feel ashamed of my actions. I would have understood if he had reported me, but it hurts that he had to take the high road.

25,1camiko,AITA for calling her out? ,"
AITA? for context i am currently 35 weeks pregnant with my 1st child and my mom and i have always had a relatively close relationship but it seems that ever since i became pregnant that she’s no longer really my friend? i am an adult and engaged to be married so i don’t think she’s upset about the baby but every time i try to vent to her it just turns into a huge lecture/lesson. 

for example- my dad is a drug addict and has recently took a turn for the worse (they’re divorced) and my younger sister and i don’t get along anymore (we used to) and i made a comment to my mom about how i wish my sister and my dad could attend the shower and be there for this huge moment in my life and she came back basically saying that i sounded ungrateful for all of the people that are there for me (mind you i never said that i was ungrateful and am so blessed for all of the support that we do have) but i just wanted to vent and she just shut it down immediately and made me feel like my feelings weren’t valid. 


another example and the reason i’m writing this post is because i was pretty annoyed with my husband who was out fishing for the 3rd time this last weekend instead of helping me finish our to do list and i mentioned it to my mom (i will admit that i was pretty upset with him and did send a pretty snarky text to him while he was fishing that i told her about and i understand i probably should have kept our argument private but i just wanted someone to talk to) and she told me that i shouldn’t nag him and when i pushed back and told her that i didn’t feel it was fair that she said that and tried to explain my side of the story she basically told me “you’re probably not very fun to live with” and “keep it up and see how long your relationship lasts” and made comments that i was “screaming” and my husband? and all i was trying to do was just vent. she vents about her husband to me all of the time and i always just offer an ear to listen and let her get it off her chest. 

she also told me today that i am selfish “you’re not the only one in the room and one day you’ll learn that” and that she has more wisdom and life experience than i so she just knows best. i tried to tell her how she made me feel and it just kept turning into lecture after lecture so i just stopped responding. i have been up all night crying and i just don’t know if i’m crazy and just being extra sensitive or what? 

my husband and i aren’t even upset with each other anymore and we seriously resolved the tiff in about 30 minutes and i did apologize to him about sending the snarky text but for some reason she feels very strongly that i was mean to him? he even feels that she is being weird/snarky about all of this and agreed that it wasn’t that serious. 

i just feel like everything that i say/have said this pregnancy she just invalidates by saying things like “that’s tough” or “that’s just the way it is. we all go through it” and i really just want to hear “i understand how you feel.” AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,"AITA for calling her out?

26,1camcci,AITA for asking my sisters friend to clean my cats litter box?,"Long story short, due to my apartment restrictions my cat has been at my mom’s house because my apartment wants to charge an exorbitant amount for pets so I have an agreement with my mom I can have her at her house as long as I come back and clean her box which I’ve been doing every other day.

I can’t come everyday because she lives quite some ways. Anyway this would be the second one of my sisters friends who would be coming to live with us due to parental issues. I expressed interest in coming back home due to raising prices and I couldn’t because the extra room was taken.

We just recently moved and my mom got a house where’d I’d get my own room. I’d already begun moving my stuff from storage into my room because I’m paying 100$ a month for it.

However as soon as we fully moved into the house my sisters other friend got kicked out at 18 by her parents and has nowhere else to be. My mom asked if she could stay in my room. I reluctantly said sure if she cleans the litter box since I have to keep it in my room. She said okay. I’m very peculiar with my room I don’t like outside shoes on floor or clothes on my bed or anything. I told mom this and she said okay.

Today my mom was sick so I made my way to her to check and my mom said it’s not my sisters friends responsibility to clean after my cat and it’s not my room. This of course confused me because she previously said okay. I didn’t put up an argument releasing my room. I don’t want the girl to be homeless I didn’t put any rules or restrictions. I just asked for the cat to limit my trips home to save gas and time ( it’s takes about 45 minutes from my job to get home) since she’d be there. Am I wrong? Is it too much? I don’t want to be mean or rude. I just feel like everytime I express interest in moving back home I can’t because one of my sisters friends comes and takes the space. Even when I was living at home I didn’t have a “room” it was a blocked off space with a curtain. 

  
edit: I wasn’t going to say no if my mom had said no. but she said okay during our phone call asking if the friend could stay in my room then changed her mind all of a sudden.

I m28 have had a difficult time lately due to my relationship, which has now turned into a long-distance one, and a serious illness affecting my mother. However, during this period, a good friend w25 of mine, who also works in the same company but in a different department, and whom I have known for more than a year, has been very supportive.

As a token of appreciation, I've gifted her a ticket to an event that we both will be attending, and she's very excited about it. Recently, she went out to eat with a colleague from my department, \~m32 years old. This was the second lunch they've had, and neither she nor I have any personal connection with him. However, I get along well with him since we share similar interests. She told him about the event, and after I returned from lunch, he immediately messaged me asking if he could join us.

I've chatted with my friend about it, and neither of us wants that because we prefer to go alone together, and we haven't even told our close circle of friends about it. Now, I'm very likely going to message the colleague explaining my background and that the ticket is seen as a gift, and I would like to attend the event with her alone.

28,1cam66c,WIBTA if I set a boundary with my sister?,"Hello, I (19) recently moved into my father's home because of a health decline. My sister(Mel 20) has always been living with one of our parents (she stays with our mom most days and our dad rarely and it is never consistent).  I take care of her dog when she is not here and we both share a room with our dads and we share a bunk bed(it's relevant). I have known that my sister is on and off with her motivation because of her mental health.

But since moving in I have been getting more of the picture because we share the same space now. but she doesn't pick up her clothing when removing them and just leaves them on the floor. She leaves her shoes everywhere and she leaves her makeup and snack wrappers and her stuff everywhere. 

Usually, I pick up after her because I want the space we both share to be clean for the both of us. I have done her laundry and made her bed and I have even put up her dirty dishes.

I have empathy and patience but she is rarely at my dad's and my breaking point was when today I came back from a trip and I saw clothing all over the floor and snack wrappers on my bed because I have the bigger one with more room I am assuming she was staying on it while I was gone. I have no problem with her staying in my bed but I just want her to pick up after herself especially since there's a tiny trash can in arm's reach. 

I just want to encourage her to keep the space clean without her flipping out because I have set a boundary with her. But my health will continue to decline due to treatments and I cannot risk a fall hazard especially since I won't be able to walk after I have surgery. I can understand mental health issues and not wanting to clean but she rarely is here and it seems like she does not even care that she is leaving her stuff on my bed and in my designated space.

30,1calq7b,AITA for not wanting to babysit my wife’s brother’s movers soon after major surgery?,"I (46m) just had a colectomy last week. I can’t drive or return to work for two weeks (doctors orders), however, I will return to work remotely in the next couple days.  My wife (43f) has been super supportive and has taken amazing care of me the entire time. She took time off work to be with me the day of, and the days following, even though it was bad timing for her. She’s been my absolute rock!

Her brother (41m) moves around a lot for work and happened to live in the same city with us for about a year. He’s moved on to another gig, and he has already moved there. He’s staying in temporary housing until his new employer can come get all his stuff. He and my wife had a conversation about the movers and he asked her if she can meet the movers to let them in, watch them package everything for a cross-country shipment, sign for it, lock up after, and turn the keys into building management. I wasn’t part of this conversation but at some point she agreed to it but requested it be on a weekend when she doesn’t have work because she can’t take anymore days off work. I got all this one evening when she told me about it. I wasn’t being asked to do anything at the time, so it was just informational. Evidently, her brother did try to schedule on a weekend but that was impossible because they’re too busy. 

So, now I’m being asked to take care of it and I’m unsure I should take on this responsibility right now. On one hand, I have quite a bit of free time on my hands and I’ve been doing great in recovery. Technically, I could Uber there and do all the things he asked.  On the other hand, this isn’t exactly the kind of activity I should be doing right now. It’s an apartment so it’s not a house full of stuff, but I know from personal experience when they pack stuff up to ship cross-country, it takes a good amount of time to dutifully package even the smallest of items. We don’t have an estimated time it will take the movers, but if I had to guess, I’d say 2-4 hours, but regardless I’m stuck there until they’re done. It’ll be 10 days after my surgery and I can’t help but feel like she’s asking a lot of me. She seems to act like it’ll be no big deal and I’ll be fine. She said he has no one else to do it. 

I didn’t flat out say no when we discussed it yesterday. I aired my concerns, she didn’t see an issue, and we left it there. Part of me felt like that caring, nurturing, “don’t get up”, “be careful” every time I get up person vanished in blink of an eye. 

So what say you, AITA for not wanting to take on this responsibility so soon after major surgery?

It’s an apartment so it’s not a house full of stuff, but I know from personal experience when they pack stuff up to ship cross-country, it takes a good amount of time to dutifully package even the smallest of items. We don’t have an estimated time it will take the movers, but if I had to guess, I’d say 2-4 hours, but regardless I’m stuck there until they’re done. It’ll be 10 days after my surgery and I can’t help but feel like she’s asking a lot of me. She seems to act like it’ll be no big deal and I’ll be fine. She said he has no one else to do it. 

I didn’t flat out say no when we discussed it yesterday. I aired my concerns, she didn’t see an issue, and we left it there. Part of me felt like that caring, nurturing, “don’t get up”, “be careful” every time I get up person vanished in blink of an eye. 

So what say you, AITA for not wanting to take on this responsibility so soon after major surgery?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the sanity check! I thought I was being crazy for a minute lol. It very was helpful to get everyone’s perspective so I can focus on getting better. Many thanks!!",0.0,0.017025528,0,1
31,1calp71,AITA for making a to my wife about eating to much chocolate?,"My wife (29 female) doesn't usually eat a lot of chocolate. Last night she ate about half a slab in 5min, which I found unusual.

I (23-F)'ve been with Elle(29-F) for almost 4 months now. We hace a LDR so when i come visit her i stay for a few days in which i take care of the chores since i'm currently looking for a job in the city. My stays can go for over a week at times. 

Elle is really organiced, like REALLY. She has a routine and a way to do stuff that we don't quite share and that causes some conflict. Our worst disagreement is that i sleep a Lot, i can't help it, if my body can find a way to oversleep, it Will. This has already Made me wake up a little short in time, making the meals or housework go under our expectations. 

We're talked, fougth and even broke up about it, but we always calm down, talk and solve it. 
What makes me write this post is that i was supposed to leave today in the early Morning, But i had a terrible nigth over some physical sickness and Elle told me to stay in bed, therefore inviting me to at least one more day at the house. I stayed and after like one hour of sleep i got up despite my aches and did all the pending household chores (i'm trying to have an early routine), trusting there was enough leftovers from dinner so i didnt  have to worry about cooking. 

When it was time to Heat lunch (Elle has a work break that allows her to come Home for lunch) i realized half of the leftovers were missing, so i started preparing something quick so she could enjoy the fresh food while i had the leftovers. I made the mistake of sending my girlfriend a pic of the halved leftovers, we chuckled a bit and then i told her i've only seen the food SO late because i wanted to reheat that for lunch.

 She saw the message and didnt reply but as soon as she came thru the door she did it like a tornado, without saying hi and straight to asking me to move so she could cook something herself. I finished the meal when i realized she Made lunch only for herself, not caring if i eat or not and overall ignoring my presence in the house. 
I went away to finish packing while crying (i'm an easy cryer) thinking she would insinuate for me to leave the house and go back to my Town, but she didnt, she just left w/out Even saying goodbye. 

I feel like Shell never be happy with my work at the house no matter what i do and i really need yo know if AITA in this situation.

33,1cakpul,AITA in this conversation about privilege?,"My girlfriend (26F) and I (28M) are both student researchers. Some background: growing up, I lived with my uncle who was an academic researcher himself while my girlfriend did not grow up around academicians and has worked really hard to be in the position that she is today. 

During one of our conversations, she mentioned to me that a senior PhD student was asking her for guidance regarding a summer school application which my girlfriend had successfully completed last year. In response, I mentioned to her that these applications are very challenging and she should definitely help the senior student. I told her that I recently had to submit a bunch of similar applications and couldn't find many helpful resources myself.

My girlfriend did not like my response and mentioned that these two situations are not the same. She felt that I was being blind to the immense academic privilege I have had by growing up around academicians and that I was simply trying to sound relatable to someone who probably did not have the same resources as me growing up. 

*EDIT: I think it is important to mention that my girlfriend would've helped the senior student anyway even without my comment. I have no doubt about it. The question was mostly about whether I come off as being blind to privilege if I tell her that I faced a similar problem. *

AITA?  I believe I would've definitely been wrong had I said that it's not a big deal and she shouldn't worry about helping the senior student. Because then, I wouldn't be taking into account the academic advantage that I have had. But to me it seems like I was just asking her to help the student and was giving her additional context that even I (someone that she knows, and also knows that I love doing applications) had a lot of trouble with a similar application. 

Sorry if this question is too specific, or if this is not the right sub. I told my girlfriend that I will think more about this situation and seek perspective from other people. Any advice is appreciated :)

Bob became friends w my bf in college (we all went to the same college. i picked this college BECAUSE of my bf [im an idiot for this i know]) but Bob annoys the crap out of me. Every time my bf goes out with Bob, he comes home VERY under the influence. I know Bob’s main ex gf, who has told me all the dirty details on the relationship. Bob cheated, was doing drugs (weed and ❄️) , he was verbally abusive, was bad with their pets, and was overall not a good bf to her. Bob is now single and wants to go out in a big city all of the time w my bf. I hate how he comes home late and is always too intoxicated to have a real conversation with me (I’ve never told anyone this, but one of the more recent times my bf was so drunk he came home and peed on the floor). I hate this friend and I tell my bf I don’t want him hanging out with Bob. He states that Bob is one of his ‘best friends’ and it is unfair for me to ask him to stop hanging out with Bob. Since I know what kind of bf Bob is, and because of how my bf acts when he gets home, I thought it was semi-reasonable to try to set a boundary. AITA for this? I never wanted to be the type of girlfriends to put an ultimatum on my partner’s friends, but I thought this situation was okay to do so. I just picture Bob trying to get girls when they go out to bars, and I trust my bf, but I know how it is when friends go out and one talks to some guy, so the friend of the girl has to talk to the friend of the guy. Do I need to drop my disdain towards him and deal with them hanging out every once in a while? Or am I right in not wanting them to hangout? Pls help!! ",1.0,1.0214108,1,1
41,1caif9v,AITA for never asking my wealthy in laws to invite my siblings or immediate family on our big vacations?,"My wife and I have been married for about 8 years now. I had a pretty generic middle class upbringing while her family would be considered ""Old money"". I have no idea how much wealth they actually have but its multi-generational and needless to say they'll never worry about money.

They never give us cash outright, but for each of our kids births they set aside 100k in an interest bearing account for their college and they have been extremely generous with the vacations they've taken us on. My wife and I both have pretty good jobs and while we have the security of knowing if we ever needed it, they'd help us, we are able to support our not very fancy lifestyle ourselves.

This July were going on a trip with our kids and her family, including the nuclear family's of her two siblings and then a few family friends of theirs. MIL and FIL are paying for everything including the flights, villa were staying at, and various meals and activities. This will be the 5th vacation like this they've taken us on. Not including our honeymoon they paid for. I never imagined being this close to that kind of wealth before but I have to say they've been nothing but welcoming and generous with me. Even offering me high paying jobs I probably dont deserve and offering to pay for my grad school if I choose to go.

My sister recently asked me what my summer plans were and if I had any trips. I told her about this one and she got noticeably annoyed/jealous. She asked me why Ive never asked about inviting her and her family since other friends of the family get invited often to these big trips.

42,1caicb2,AITA For being frustrated with my partner for doing no housework whilst he looks for a job after being made redundant?,"My (23F) partner (25M) has lost his job nearly 3 weeks ago now. 

Thankfully, his old boss has agreed to pay him for 1 month if he left immediately, to give him an opportunity to find elsewhere.

This is his third job that he lost, due to redundancy.

I'm trying to be a supportive girlfriend but I won't lie, it's really stressing me out. Due to everything going up in cost over the last 2 years, we spend nearly double on bills and haven't been putting that much away into savings, as odd costs keep coming up. My entire wage just about covers all our bills but nothing else. 

We are okay this month, but come May - we will most likely have to dip into our savings until he finds a job which isn't ideal as we are trying to save up to improve our house. 

Now, he has used this time to apply for jobs. He's had a few interviews. He's not been told no, the interview process is just drawn out, so he has to have at least 2 or 3 calls with each company.

My partner has therefore been at home for nearly 3 weeks now, and during this time has done barely any housework. 

I work full time, 5 days a week. I work from 9am and finish at 6 or 7pm, with a 30 minute commute. I find my job to be high stress and low reward so I'm unhappy but obviously it's not wise for me to leave anytime soon, as at least it's very stable. After work, all I want to do is relax and play games and save all my chores for the weekend. 

My partner only does chores when I tell him to, usually with me at the weekend. His job was pretty relaxed and he would always be home sooner than me, at 6pm.

The house really needs a lot doing, with my job taking up more of my time recently, house work has piled up but I just don't have the time. I've worked 3 weekends recently too. It would have been really nice to come back to a clean home, and a maintained garden. 

I tried to find a balance between being a supportive girlfriend, so I hinted at housework needing doing. Prompting questions like what was he up to, and telling him that XYZ really need doing. 

Nothing happened. 

Eventually I got annoyed and told him that as he's not currently working, he should have the time to do housework - he's not done anything, not even washing dishes after us. 

He got defensive and told me he doesn't sit on his arse all day and he has been applying for jobs, in call interviews, and had a couple physical ones and a few more lined up. 

It has been a week since I snapped but he's still barely done anything around the house. 

I know it's stressful for him too, so I don't want to pile on, but am I crazy for thinking he genuinely does have a LOT more free time to do the tasks we have struggled to get on top of such as garden work, painting, cleaning, etc, whilst both still working? 

I feel bad for snapping, but I've come home today and the house is still a mess. I know he didn't have any interviews today, and with the stress of my job and his unemployment - I feel really fed up and I just can't cope.

45,1cai0b6,AITA for “bailing” when “something better came up”?,"Last week, my roomate was telling me she had a really expensive car servicing she had to get done and she had to Uber there and back and it’s 25 mins away. I told her I could drive her that I’d be home all week. She seemed surprised and was like thank you so much blah blah blah. She’s leaving right after to go out of state, so it’s not like we had plans to hang out or do anything. I was happy to give her the rides because I’d be home. 

This weekend, my boyfriends parents just said he has to work in New York all week, and for my birthday invited me to come with them. We’d leave Wednesday morning. Wednesday is the day my roomate needed the rides but I forgot in the moment and was excited to go to New York and said yes.

Although, looking back even if I remembered in the moment I feel like I would’ve asked if it was alright if I did that instead of give her the rides. I don’t think I’d have really been willing to stay home all week alone (boyfriend and roomates would all be away) just to give someone 100 minutes worth of driving time for free that they didn’t NEED. If i was already home I I wouldn’t mind and would be happy to do it for her. 

Also, to clarify, if she wasn’t able to/planning on ubering, and if she didn’t have that budgeted for I would have made sure to keep my word. I just felt like I offered to make her life easier by giving up almost two hours of my time for free, and now that it doesn’t work out I feel bad but not as if I’ve betrayed her or ditched her for something better. I’d never have ditched her just to hang out with a friend, but this wasn’t something I could reschedule. 

Today she let me know very nicely that she’s really hurt that I bailed on her once something better came along and needs to know that I won’t do that to her in the future. She says she would’ve been fine if I never offered, but thinks it’s inconsiderate/rude to offer and then bail when something better comes up. 

Am I in the wrong here? She was ubering in the first place, it’s not like she was looking for rides from others and I bailed last minute. I feel like I offered to do her a favor and now that it doesn’t really work out, I feel bad but I don’t feel like I’ve done something wrong. She feels that it was really inconsiderate of me to say yes to my boyfriend’s parents after offering her a ride last week. 

Also, any advice on how to avoid this situation or how I could’ve avoided it would be helpful. I never would’ve expected them to offer me last minute to come with them and I wasn’t looking forward to being alone so many days. I was excited at the opportunity. I also don’t feel that offering to do someone a big favor justifies saying no to an entire trip that someone offers. I never would’ve offered if I thought that was a possibility. 


Edit for clarity: I would not have cancelled to just hang out with someone else. This was a trip that could not be moved and was a surprise for me and I told her as soon as I knew.

Leave them home alone, I was ok w/ me at work if he told me & fed them. They couldnt make themselves food bcuz he would eat it all I bought & wouldnt replenish. No communication, no working w/ me. There was no point him living w/ us. 
6 wks later, we were at my bonus daughter last dance competition. He was super sad. He told me the chick (why he neglected the kids) was ghosting him & he in shambles. Depressed & couldnt eat (his own words). He wasnt like that when I ended us or the thought of losing our daughters. Chick he known 2 mos, convinced love at 1st site. Things did get better 4 us cordially coparenting 4 about 1 mon. 

Then 2 mos str8 he was the worst, not caring to see the girls. I only reached out to get him off the lease (legally only he could ) but he refused?? He got himself off the lease once his mom got involved. 1 rule was our girls are not to meet any1 we are w/ til its serious & other parent meets them 1st. After the worst 2 mos I find out she came back into his life why he was so difficult w/ me & distant I assume. 4 months later 4 the holidays. Ex nice w/ me bcuz he wants me to meet chick he now lives w/. I refuse. It should be 1 yr because the narcissist he is will come out @ 6 mos. 4 Thanksgiving his mom invites us (my kids & I).

She was weird. 4 Christmas, I was wanting to drop off my 4 kids w/ his family but they all convinced me to stay. Chick was there. It was even weirder. That was Dec 23rd. My ex saw his girls Dec 28th 4 10 mins & not again for 4 weeks. It took me getting onto him to see them. Find out chick broke up w/ him, he moved out. In shambles. Again. Single, he was seeing his girls atleast once a week. This went on for 1 mon then the next month leading up to Easter he was distant again. He said busy & talking to multiple women. My bonus son wanted me 2 go 2 his baseball games, of course Im there. There ex FIL & I plan an easter get together. We go. He takes his ex, she unexpectedly hugs me & my kids. I & my kids very uncomfortable. I asked are they together?? He said idk ask her. It was super weird. She did 2 things that were a hard no for me to my kids infront of me.

We agreed to transition him moving out, 6 mos turned 1 year then 15 mos (his choice) b4 I kicked him out. 14.5 mos in he was acting strange & neglecting the kids. Leave them home alone, I was ok w/ me at work if he told me & fed them. They couldnt make themselves food bcuz he would eat it all I bought & wouldnt replenish. No communication, no working w/ me. There was no point him living w/ us. 
6 wks later, we were at my bonus daughter last dance competition. He was super sad. He told me the chick (why he neglected the kids) was ghosting him & he in shambles. Depressed & couldnt eat (his own words). He wasnt like that when I ended us or the thought of losing our daughters. Chick he known 2 mos, convinced love at 1st site. Things did get better 4 us cordially coparenting 4 about 1 mon. 

Then 2 mos str8 he was the worst, not caring to see the girls. I only reached out to get him off the lease (legally only he could ) but he refused?? He got himself off the lease once his mom got involved. 1 rule was our girls are not to meet any1 we are w/ til its serious & other parent meets them 1st. After the worst 2 mos I find out she came back into his life why he was so difficult w/ me & distant I assume. 4 months later 4 the holidays. Ex nice w/ me bcuz he wants me to meet chick he now lives w/. I refuse. It should be 1 yr because the narcissist he is will come out @ 6 mos. 4 Thanksgiving his mom invites us (my kids & I). My bonus kids want to see me & their siblings, very close to my older 2. I meet chick. She meets my girls. She was weird. 4 Christmas, I was wanting to drop off my 4 kids w/ his family but they all convinced me to stay. Chick was there. It was even weirder. That was Dec 23rd. My ex saw his girls Dec 28th 4 10 mins & not again for 4 weeks. It took me getting onto him to see them. Find out chick broke up w/ him, he moved out. In shambles. Again. Single, he was seeing his girls atleast once a week. This went on for 1 mon then the next month leading up to Easter he was distant again. He said busy & talking to multiple women. My bonus son wanted me 2 go 2 his baseball games, of course Im there. There ex FIL & I plan an easter get together. We go. He takes his ex, she unexpectedly hugs me & my kids. I & my kids very uncomfortable. I asked are they together?? He said idk ask her. It was super weird. She did 2 things that were a hard no for me to my kids infront of me. Im getting reports of her & my ex at his son’s game drunk or high, almost kicked out of the game by officials bcuz so disgruntle. 1st time he wants to see his girls on a weekend SINCE HE MOVED OUT 14 MOS AGO. I said “depends, how long & is his ex being there. This is why I want to have a discussion. For now it’s best for my girls that they arent around her.” Ive tried having a discussion past 2 weeks w/ him which he refused.

49,1cah500,WIBTA if I didn’t split the lottery “evenly”.,"I was out with some friends and we were talking about how the lottery jackpot was over a billion. I on a whim decided to slap down $20 for my first ever lottery purchase. My two buddies then get up and buy $6 and $2 tickets.

While we were then talking about how we’d spend our hypothetical winnings (which is the only actual fun part of the lottery), my friends said “we’d of course split it 3 ways”. My response was basically “what? No.”, we would split it proportionally. There are 14 tickets, and I bought 10/14s of them so that’s how the payout would go. You can spring the “even payout” rule *after* we all buy different amounts. i was then shouted down as being the unreasonable one, and that of course you always pool and evenly split.

To be clear, we did not win the lottery (shocker), and if I did win the jackpot id probably split it evenly anyway (it’s an ungodly amount of money and a few million difference wouldn’t actually change its affect on my life), but if I won a smaller jackpot of $100,000? I’d probably be more inclined to split it proportionally

I honestly cannot tell if I am being the unreasonable one here.

But when I turned 20 I finally got out of my bad ways and cut Frank off. 
     I slowly got my relationship back with my siblings and my father. I talked to my mother then too. But a few months after my 20th birthday I got hurt. I didn’t start my bad habits again but I texted my mother and she flipped on me. She blamed me for what happened and she called me selfish and a lot more. She disowned me for something I went through. A few months after that I found out she had stolen my Christmas presents from her side of the family and used the money they gave me. I then found out she made fun of me for sleeping in my closet because I was scared to sleep in my room because of what happened to me in my room.

52,1cag9su,WIBTA if I forced the issue on spouse de-cluttering sentimental items?,"Hey all,

Coming here to vent, but also curious to hear people's thoughts, especially if you've dealt with something similar. My spouse and mother in law have a bunch of containers of things of sentimental value. At our previous house we kept most of these things in our (wonderfully oversized) garage, when we moved we wound up putting these things into a storage unit, and when the storage unit jacked up the rates on us I pressed for getting out of the unit, which we did. The good of it is we stopped paying the expensive monthly fees on the unit, the bad of it is now a small room of our house is essentially a storage unit and is now otherwise useless. It has also begun accumulating other clutter in addition to the contents of the storage unit. 

My spouse and MIL have indicated their intent to go through these things and greatly consolidate them but have not followed through on it. I have also made it more than clear that I would help them go through these things when they decide to, or if they would like to do so privately I would plan something for our children and myself that would get us out of the house and give them the whole day. Relevant info - MIL lives out of state, and while she does visit frequently this always winds up getting pushed off to the next visit. If it was just a hodge-podge of random things, I would have no problem reminding them that they need to go through that stuff and make decisions on it. If that were the case, I'd offer to do the work myself. 

Here is what makes the situation delicate: The containers are mostly (80%) items related to my spouse's two siblings, who tragically passed away in separate incidents a few years ago. I have always held firm that it is not my place to tell them what they should or should not do with those things, nor is it my place to decide when enough time has passed for them to deal with those items, but we are a growing family and will need that room in usable shape relatively soon. Our house is not large, but absolutely does have the space to meet our needs as a family. When we purchased the house we had a specific vision for that room and it wasn't ""storage unit."" 

Lastly, our garage is already over-capacity and is not an option for these containers, and even if it were my spouse does not wish to keep them in the garage where there isn't any climate control. 

We plan on having another child relatively soon (house purchased with that in-mind), and I have a bad gut feeling that if we don't address those items before we get pregnant again then that room will remain useless indefinitely.

53,1cag7rk,AITA for my dog pooping even though I picked up after him?,"I was dog sitting the other day for my family that was out of town (I grew up with that dog though before I moved out, so I've walked him plenty of times before). He's a medium sized dog, and I was talking him for a walk around the block. My family lives in a typical suburban residential neighborhood, plenty of other dogs getting walked too.


He of course likes to sniff everything, trees, random spots in the lawn, light posts. Like dogs do, so stopping and sniffing is not 100% a ""I need to poop"" sign, but down the street, as he was doing that, he squatted to poop while he was on someone's lawn. To be specific, this wasn't in the middle of the main part of the lawn or anything like that. This was in the smaller grassy area between the sidewalk and the street (not sure of the specific word for that), and pretty close to the sidewalk. As I took a bag out of my pocket to pick it up, a guy who was standing behind me in the driveway, that I didn't notice and I've never even talked to before, started complaining.


I don't remember the specific words said, but he more or less said ""Come on, don't do that here, get out here"". It was not in a very polite way. I replied that I am picking it up, but he didn't accept that. ""Well I play ball with my son, don't do that"". And I said again, but I'm picking it up. ""Where do you live? Down the street? Well, then they do it there"". I more or less said, I'm taking him for a walk, and he had to go, I can't help that, what am I supposed to do? (I didn't say this to the guy, but FWIW he did already poop before- he went a second time just then, and that's pretty typical, he often goes multiple times). At this point I had picked it up and I just walked away, crossing the street as he went inside.


Now, if I didn't pick it up? 100% I would be the AH.  But, I did pick up, and I think that guy was going too far with that reaction to me. It's not like I specifically took the dog down the street to poop on that grass, and he could've talked to me more polite about it if he had an issue anyways, since he saw *I* do pick up after my dog. I can understand not being happy about it, there's some stray cats in the area that go wherever and I have seen random poo piles before on lawns, but, that's still not me doing that. (And another guy across the street who must of seen what went on asked if that guy complained to me, and when I said yes, he called him a AH).

57,1caejbs,AITA for using my ex' connections?,"Hi Im 27, Female

6 months ago me and my ex - Mark broke up. We were dating for like 3 months, it clicked but he wasnt ready for commitment. We ended it on good terms tho.

During those 6 months of no contact I messeged him once to meet up... but he turned me down... so I just moved on.

He saw me by accident recently at the party, and after that texted me - how I feel rn, how I'm doing and if I want to meet up.

We met for coffee and it was fun. He said I'm great person and he's glad we're fine, but doesnt know when we'll get a chance for meeting again.

When we were dating, I met his friends who is a gerenal manager of shoes store, and they told me if I need something I can always ask them.

Week after that I impulsively asked Mark for a favour, to get me something from his friend (150$ shoes but cheaper)

He wrote me LITERALLY an ESSAY, how good person he is, because he's not using her friend for free stuff!!! And that's why he never asked ME for anything.... The tone of the message sounded so pretentious!

Right now... I'm not getting them with discount.... somehow they want to give it to me for free....

I was so shocked I didnt ask how and why it happend... And now it's a bit too late for that I guess

And now I feel extremely guilty... and want to give them up..... that's so messed up...

59,1caefdq,AITA for trying to convince my childhood “friend” to not work with me? ,"So I have a childhood friend named Liz right, and starting with middle school/high school we sorta disconnected, but about two years ago we reconnected as our parents are friends with each other and we had Easter together

Liz always been pretty weird, especially since then though, and Liz would be texting my siblings a lot since then which they weren’t really tolerating as they weren’t that close to Liz. I however was the only one who could at least tolerate her, and Liz has been texting me for two years since then. However, I’ve given Liz multiple opportunities to hang out, and she would always come up with weird excuses, such as “I’ll check my schedule to see” and then never reach back to me. 

On my birthday, me and my friends went to a wine festival, and Liz showed up towards the end of the festival with one of her friends, and told me she would “shop around” before meeting us, to which I responded saying to meet us right then because the booths were shutting down and then we can go to the stores. It being my birthday wasn’t as much as Liz’s concern as her focusing on the friend she brought. 

I’ve tried to bring up possibly seeking mental help, as Liz told me she struggles with it, particularly not doing well in school or work, and that her sister suggested she might have ADHD. However, it seems like her pride seems to get in the way of things, because she told me the reason why she hadn’t been diagnosed is that she doesn’t want to feel there’s anything wrong with her. 

Today, Liz sent me a text saying that she applied for a position at the store I work at, and was interviewing tomorrow. I tried to convince Liz not to work there by saying I’m quitting soon, I have friends in that position and they find it stressful, and that she wouldn’t like it. I haven’t heard back, but I know that since Liz has a spotty resume and hasn’t done well at her previous jobs, that it would be a bad look on me if she says she knows me.

61,1cae6ng,AITA for misinterpreting my friend for being mad?,"(Apologies for all the wrong grammar, spelling, and if some parts doesn't make sense in advance)

I would like to put some context before I begin. I live in a country that speaks many dialects.

Recently, I had this friend (lets call them, Wendy's) in a friend group which one would say is an nonchalant type of person. We only met for 2 years and only had been close for 6 months at best. I do love their nonchalant personality, but sometimes it can be quite difficult to distinguish from sarcasm, information, or any type of personality.

The problem started a few hours ago where me and a few of my friends are talking about a graduation ball that was happening.  Another friend of ours told me that one of hairpiece of a costume was perfect for the theme, I told them it very much did. That same friend sarcastically said ""I would wear a wig to that event"" (the friend was talking about a costume wig, the colourful ones). Now Wendy replied with ""Ew"" and ""who wears that kind of wig to a graduation ball"" They meant who wears a colourful wig to a ball that's not costume themed. Now this is the part where it gets a bit confusing.



I replied to Wendy saying ""NO??"".   When I said 'NO' I wasn't trying to disagree with them, in fact I was agreeing with them (Its not the English no, but an agreeing exclamation in my language, that's just how I spell it). Wendy probably misinterpreted this because they then replied why would I agree on something like this. I then tried to clear things out by saying that I didn't disagree with them but in fact agreed. They then argued back saying if I were to agree on something I would say No, adding "" are you okay?"" and ""Nice vocabulary"" . I didn't wanna say things anymore cause to me, it seemed like they were mad, so I just said ""fine, ill say 'right' next time"" and ""why are you mad at such small things"" (kind of a bad move tbh).  Turns out they weren't mad and were just ""clarifying"".  I feel like I wasn't in the wrong since Im confused on the way they texted. It was literally like someone was mad at you. But in the same time I feel like Im in the wrong since I shouldn't have said so much gibberish in the first place. Tbh, I don't know what to say nor do, I wanna be friends with them because I enjoy their company but it seemed like I'm already making an enemy of them.  AITA??

AITA for not reconciling with my cheating ex and distancing from her daughter?  
  
I've opted for anonymity here due to the sensitivity of the situation.  
  
My relationship with Sara (33F) began a decade after our friendship started. She has a daughter, which wasn't an issue for me as I like kids. However, Sara's drinking habits became a recurring problem. Initially, her alcohol-induced friskiness was amusing, but it quickly grew tiresome as it often led to arguments she expected me to forget the next day. Despite this, I saw the good in her, influenced by my parents' belief that imperfections are part of life and relationships.  
  
Financially, I was the main provider, which allowed Sara to manage her own and her daughter's needs. After years of being together and seeing past her flaws, I considered proposing. However, her unpredictable behavior when drunk held me back, despite my own occasional pot use. Yet, I bought a ring, planning to propose when the time felt right.  
  
The tipping point came when Sara went on a camping trip with her daughter while I stayed back due to work commitments. She returned with a newfound resolve to stop drinking, which initially made me hopeful. Three weeks later, as I planned a cruise to propose, a friend from the trip disclosed that Sara might have been unfaithful. This suspicion was confirmed when Sara abruptly admitted to cheating during the camping trip.  
  
Devastated, I sought solitude in a hotel, turning off my phone and disappearing for days. Upon my return, I was met with attempts by Sara to repair our relationship, using her daughter as leverage. This manipulation deepened my pain, leading me to seek professional help. My therapist advised cutting ties for my mental health.  
  
Despite the complexity of our living situation, I attempted to set boundaries, requesting Sara to move out while offering financial support for her transition. The emotional toll was immense, as I still cared deeply for her daughter, but could no longer envision a future with Sara.  
  
My decision to isolate myself, living reclusively in my basement, has left me questioning my actions. The quietness of what was once a lively home now echoes with regret and solitude. Friends reach out, but I remain disconnected, grappling with guilt and the impact of my decisions on Sara's daughter.

The iPad's screen is not working as well and she asked me to buy another one (because I get to buy it tax free). My mom barely uses it, only my sister (4) uses it to watch videos and play. 

My issue with this is that she has grown addicted to the iPad, she spends most of her day on it and is not able to eat or behave in restaurants without the iPad. I've brought this to my mom's attention and she dismisses it saying she's not using it much, just when she gets home from school. Which is not true. I told her at the moment I'm not buying another iPad cause I would just be enabling my sister's addiction to the iPad instead of her learning how to behave. I understand being a parent is tiresome, but don't believe an iPad should be doing the caretaking.

The iPad's screen is not working as well and she asked me to buy another one (because I get to buy it tax free). My mom barely uses it, only my sister (4) uses it to watch videos and play. 

My issue with this is that she has grown addicted to the iPad, she spends most of her day on it and is not able to eat or behave in restaurants without the iPad. I've brought this to my mom's attention and she dismisses it saying she's not using it much, just when she gets home from school. Which is not true. I told her at the moment I'm not buying another iPad cause I would just be enabling my sister's addiction to the iPad instead of her learning how to behave. I understand being a parent is tiresome, but don't believe an iPad should be doing the caretaking.

67,1cacd66,AITA for leaving my friend at the club?,"this is a complicated story.

Kayla (fake name) and I (both 23F) went to a club for the first time. I invited her to tag along with a guy, Sam (also fake name) and his friend. Sam and his friend said they may not make it but we had already gotten ready. we go anyway. 

fast forward about 4 hours and we've been at the club for a while. Kayla was worried about being 3rd wheeled but didn't want to be around Sam and I when he showed up. I was wary about it but if/when he showed up, I agreed to split. Sam's friend ended up not coming which was fine with both of us. 

Sam shows up. We split like discussed. Kayla tried to find someone to dance with her. after an hour, Sam asks me if I'd like to leave with him. I agreed. I told Kayla and at first she said to go for it.  as I'm in the process of ""going for it"", she changes her mind. she said she didn't want to be alone and drunk, which is absolutely understandable. 

I told her I had planned to be with Sam just as much as I planned to be with her. I wanted to go but obviously I wanted her to be safe. I asked her to come find me to talk about it. she refused. I told her I'd pay for her uber home. she refused. she didn't want to speak in front of Sam. 

at that point I could tell she was upset but she was denying to see me and take my offer. I wasn't sure what to do and I told her I wanted to go do what I planned but wanted her to feel okay. Kayla said she would ""figure it out."" I said we could talk about this later and at that point I could not get re-entry without having to pay the fee again. 

now, days later she is saying she no longer wants to be my friend. Kayla says I ""risked her life for a guy."" she also said I, should have known how she felt about getting in ubers after drinking. I should have just stayed or waited for /her/ to want to leave. though, that doesn't solve the issue of her ubering alone. 

I'm very sad and confused about the situation. I'm heartbroken she feels so betrayed and that she felt like I didn't care for her. in my opinion, i wanted to come to a compromise. I didn't just want to up and leave her there without planning something for her. I feel like she was trying to guilt me and force me to do what she wanted.

68,1cacam3,AITA for not rearranging my plans due to a miscommunication ,"So I got my husband tickets for a football match for his birthday. The match is about 1 hr away from my hometown (5 hours from where we live). 

 Now instead of getting a hotel and arranging for my 2 year old to have a sleepover with MIL, my husband suggested that we stay with some of my family and spend an extended weekend there. My dad lives next to a train station so I asked him if he would be up for looking after our two year old during the match. (He has done it a few times before when we’ve both travelled down for work). 

For context my parents are separated and my mum has recently had an operation and isn’t well enough to look after my 2 year old for extended periods of time. 

So I asked my Nan if we could stay at hers for a few nights and let my Mum know we were coming down and if she wanted to do anything. I also asked if there was anything of my Sibling’s that she wanted me to bring up as they now live in the same city as me and my husband. 

Now, according to my mum we had arranged for her to look after my son while we go to a work meeting. I do not recall discussing anything with her about looking after my 2yr old. But I do appreciate that she may have interpreted us coming down and assumed I needed childcare because I had mentioned previously that I got my husband football tickets for his birthday that weekend. 

She’s now called around several members of our family about how ‘I’ve abused her’. I’ve offered to discuss further and I was already planning on taking her to one of her favourite gardens while we were down. So would still be spending more time with her than my dad overall. But she’s declined to speak with me, saying ‘I have treated her like shit’ and asked my Nan to not let me stay over. If I am staying with her side of the family I shouldn’t be seeing my dad at all. (My dad doesn’t have a spare room so we would need to pay for a hotel/camp outside instead). 

I am happy to get a hotel for one night (which is all I can afford). But I don’t want to cancel seeing my dad and not let him spend time with his grandson. Especially as the last time I visited him was for his birthday and I had to cut the time short as my mum had insisted I spend the time with her instead.

I invited my friend to come stay with me for a couple of days since they've never been to my city and I wanted to see them anyways. My friend and I have always been close but this is the first time we've ever spent this much time together so I was definitely surprised at some of their behavior...some of the things that happened on their visit:

End up shaking the bed again and telling them I'm gonna leave without them unless they wake up, they finally do and the whole time complained about being tired.

* I always ask my guests to take off their shoes in my house, it's just something I've always done growing up and I do in other peoples homes. Our house had just gotten cleaned and my friend ended up wearing their shoes and walking all over our just cleaned rug. Not a huge deal but I'm slightly annoyed.

* They broke my towel rack...bathrooms were recently renovated and we have one of those towel racks where one end is in the wall and the other end is just floating, meant for like small hand towels. Don't know why but my friend hangs one of those expandable toiletry bags to the end and now it's warped. I told them about it and they said it should be easy to fix.

So anyways, a year later and they mentioned wanting to visit again. We're still friends obviously (I just think they're an airhead) but I do not want to host them again and go through all of that. I suggested maybe we get a hotel in another city and do something fun there, but they asked me why not stay at my house.

72,1cab4r8,AITA for suggesting brother rehome his dog that I instigated he adopt?,"I live w/son, small dog & younger bro. My dog is well trained but does bark alot when home alone. I thought getting a 2nd dog might be a good thing & would help w/barking issue. So, I sorta started instigating my bro get his own dog. That way if I didn't connect w/the other dog, I wouldn't feel so bad since it not actually my dog. I did offered help w/dog dog when needed.

One day bro found a chiweenie at the county shelter. It seemed a bit impulsive to go w/the 1st dog he saw & it didn’t feel quite right how fast this was. But this was my idea so ok!

He’s a cutie! But chiwee is very territorial so is driving my dog crazy. He’s not housebroken & marks alot. Is reactive to people, dogs, & cars, which is scary cuz he bolts when doors open. He nips at people & our dog but is not overtly aggressive. We've been trying to train but either he doesn't get it or refuses to listen.

But IMHO the problem is not the dog. 

We've had dog for 3 weeks & bro's done very little training. The dog needs let out every 2hrs till he's housebroken but bro will wait 4-6hrs sometimes more. And cuz chiwee marks alot chiwee is actually in dog diapers nearly 24/7. 

Bro said he'd be home more, but leaves for long chunks of time often into late evening. Ie. Yesterday he left at 3pm, didn't get home till after 10. So since we have no idea when bro is coming home my son takes both dogs for walks (since chiwee is reactive that’s difficult) & we feed chiwee. Of the last week we have done this 5 outta 7 nights. The 2 nights he was home, he offered no help to walk or feed our dog in return. He walked & fed his dog only. YES, we offered to help but my son & I pretty much spend more time w/dog then he does. At the very least I'd appreciate communication, not just assume we'll take care of his dog.

That's not even the worst part!

Shortly after bro brought chiwee home, the impatience & harsh discipline my brother’s shown is worrying! Smacks are severe & frequent. He picks the dog up fully from the scruff often. When he bolted out one day I saw bro on all fours tackle this dog, give him full on spank & lift him up by his scruff to bring him inside.

2 weeks in Bro's solution to better deal w/dog? A SHOCK COLLAR! Yes, he nips, & is a pain, but not overtly aggressive at all! To see this 2 pronged box attached to his neck is sad.

Finally had a family meeting & I apologized for instigating. But the right thing to do is take a step back & analyze if this situation is best for the dog. Yes he's been difficult & clearly not gelling w/the family. But it's only been 3 weeks & this dog is in diapers & a shock collar. 

He said he's been thinking of getting a trainer. Now, he has yet to take this dog to the vet since brought home to get a proper evaluation! So I highly doubt he's actually going to get & pay for a trainer.

When I transferred schools and moved down to Florida, it was expected of me to be able to afford a trip back home to attend my sister’s graduation. 

For the first semester, I realized that the only way I would be able to afford going is by relying solely on my refund check as I don’t have time to work as I am busy with classes. With the price of being across the country, plus paying for my sister’s (18F) and my braces (about $310 a month) I quickly realized that I will be a couple hundred dollars short of the graduation. Because of this, I decided to wait on the next check and pay for the ticket immediately. 

During this time, life just happened. I told my family that I have a boyfriend and to my highly conservative mom, that became the topic of most conversations to eventually arguments. My mom was upset that I wanted to continue to go to school down in Florida and it has escalated to the point where my older sister and mom made the decision that I was not going to attend due to the discussions and how we aren’t getting along. So from that point forward, I simply put the money towards the braces bill and casual expenses for living across the country.

In the middle of March, my family and I started to get along and wanted me to come to the graduation. Upon looking at the prices, I saw that they have doubled and even tripled in price. From there, I sent my older sister screenshots of the prices and told her that I wouldn’t be able to attend due to not being able to afford it. I promised her that I would buy her a nice graduation gift and at the time she said it was okay because the prices were crazy. 

Fast forward to today, I have been disowned due to other outside circumstances. I pay for everything myself and my budget is tighter than ever. My mom and my older sister are upset that I won’t be at the graduation, stating that I should’ve had a job, had my boyfriend pay, or not have the braces bill. They are both upset that over the course of time, I haven’t been able to afford it stating that I “don’t care for the family” and that I am “selfish” for not going. 

I genuinely feel awful that I won’t be able to go. As an upperclassmen at my school and the nature of my major, I don’t have the time to do anything really for myself. There were times where I attempted to make some side hustles for some extra cash but it wasn’t successful. AITA for not going?

Edit: I forgot to mention but due to not being able to go, my mom said that I’m going to lose my family and that I will no longer receive any support.

74,1caal8f,AITA for calling out my grandmother on her prejudice ,"My grandmother (75F) is a very traditional. Growing up I used to love her stories and would listen with no problems but now that I’m older (17F) I’m starting to realize she’s not as good a person as I thought she was

Recently my family has gone through some rocky times due to how busy my mom is with her work and the frequency trips she’s been taking for work to various places including India and France. 

It should be noted that my mom (49F) is my father’s 2nd wife. My father(50F) married his highschool sweetheart at 19 as soon as he graduated then went into the army. My grandparents adored that woman and considered her a daughter. While he was deployed his first wife who I’ll call Maria ended up cheating on him while he was deployed in Italy in 1998. He divorced her shortly after and while he was in the process of divorce he met my mother and they hit it off. About a year later they married as soon as my father’s divorce was finalized. My grandmother hated the fact my father moved on so quickly and expressed her disapproval of my mother at every opportunity. 

After that the rest in history and they’ve been married nearly 30 years. It was only recently I discovered my grandmas distaste of my mother. I figured it out by her snide comments to my mom and the fact she took my father and her grandkids including me and my siblings out of her will. She’d criticize my mother at every opportunity and make comments on the fact she was busy and successful. Saying things like she wasn’t spending time with her son and that my mother was abusing us by being away from us so frequently.

Recently at Easter dinner my grandmother made a comment to my mom who was talking about it her recent trip to Spain and said “I don’t understand how my son puts up with your absence, he’s a person too and you’re ignoring him,” the table went silent and my mom didn’t say anything and my dad was gobsmacked. I had enough and told her she was being ridiculous and cruel to my mom for no reason. She was shocked and said that I was being very disrespectful.

My parents are asking me to apologize but I refuse. She has no right to treat my mom this way. 

Am I the asshole? 

Edit - It should be noted that the older my siblings got the more she took some of her disapproval out on us. Mocking my older brother’s (22M) career choice because he went to school for theater, making rude remarks about my older sister (20F) and her tattoos and piercings, and even me for my mental issues and the fact I have autism. However she shows no ill will towards my half sister (30F) whom my dad had with the first wife, she can do no wrong is my grandmothers eyes, even though she’s a college dropout and had a child out of wedlock which my grandma is supposedly against. 

Edit #2: Seems you guys are confused on why my dad hasn’t stopped this sooner. I’ll explain what I think is going on based on what I know. My father is actually adopted by my now grandmother whom was my biological grandmothers sister, making her my great aunt. My biological grandmother was extremely abusive to my father and he has lasting effects from it even at 50 years old. I’m sure he feels some sort of loyalty to his adopted mother and doesn’t want to mess up their relationship after all she’s done for him. I may be wrong but that’s my personal view on the situation.

75,1caae48,AITA for gatekeeping my recipes from my one upper DIL,"So my DIL has a habit of one upping people, at the beginning I don’t really notice it but it is obvious now. Everyone in the family has something they are good at and it’s like their thing. For example my daughter was really into making pies. One day DIL ( I’ll call her Kelly) asked for the recipes. My daughter gave them and started to bring pies to every family event, kinda kicking my daughter out of her thing. Then pushed for the family to compare them. My daughter wasn’t happy.

The big one which made me really notice what she was doing was when she one upped my youngest. She was 14 at the time and when they all the kids hit high school, they were responsible for getting gifts for events. My youngest wasn’t hiding the fact that she was giving me a knitted scarf for secret Santa. She was 14 and was very obvious about it. The whole family knew.

So on Christmas DIL got me a very nice scarf bonus gift, and gave it to me right after my youngest gave me hers. So that wasn’t okay. I had a conversation with her and she denied doing it, my son also told me he can’t see it.

Every since then more people have been noticing it and even my husband sees it. It has happened to almost every women/girl in the family at this point.

This brings me to the point of this post, I have really good Italian recipes form my mom. I bring them to events. My DIL asked for the recipes and I told her no. This started about why. She accused me on not giving her family recipes since I don’t see her as families and I told her it is due to her behavior. She called me a dick.

My son is also on my ass about it saying I am gatekeeping recipient since I don’t like her.

77,1caa5hw,AITA for telling my sister I'm so fucking tired of her taking from me and acting like it's what I was born for?,"So I technically was... born for her to take from. I'm a savior sibling and that was the only reason my parents had a second child. They were one and done with my sister but when she was 2 she got sick and so they had me to save her. Growing up I felt every bit of the lack of interest my parents had in me. I knew before I hit middle school that my parents had me for one reason only. Yet I saw them adore and spoil my sister and make sure she had everything. I grew up watching her grow up with devoted parents while I had none.

Because of the way we were raised my sister and I were never close. She was used to getting what she wanted and being spoiled. I was forgotten until she needed something like blood. If I ever happened to have something she wanted, you bet my parents let her have it and they had no time for me complaining about it. They had no time for me period. I'm sure on some level they were grateful that I had fulfilled my purpose. But nobody will ever convince me that they love me.

Now we're both in our 20s and my sister has tried to have a relationship. But it's still a lot of her wanting her way and for me to pay for her but she gets to choose where we go and what we do. I'm expected to give her food off my plate. She ignores when I bring up how our childhood wasn't perfect like she talks about. She brings up how I wasn't present for stuff and in the same sentence will talk about it being the best day.

Eventually I stopped saying yes or if I did, I refused to pay and refused to go along with what she wanted and we saw each other far less. I also heard from her far less. Which to me said she didn't really want a sister she just wanted the person she was used to getting whatever from.

A couple of weeks ago she showed up at my house (where I live with friends and our partners) and she told me she needed a place to stay and attempted to invite herself in. She looked rough so I told her she could get some food and something to drink but she needed to stay someplace else. I suggested she call our parents. She didn't want to go anywhere else and was trying to befriend my boyfriend and the other partners (since she knew my friends didn't like her). I made it very clear and insisted she figure something else out. She told me I should be more willing to help her out and why do I never want to do anything for her. I snapped at her saying that and I told her I am so tired of her taking from me and acting like it's what I was born to do. I told her our parents might have had me for that reason but I'm more than that and I never had a say in any of that and if she wants to talk about things not being fair then she should think more on that. She had a very explosive reaction and left. She said afterward I suck for blaming her for our parents actions. It just frustrated me because she doesn't acknowledge her own actions in that.

78,1ca9wux,WIBTA if I complained about the neighbor's motorcycle?,"Not sure if I would be the asshole/entitled person/Karen if I complained about the loud motorcycle next door....

For context, I live on the second floor of a 2-family house.  I have a back porch and a back yard.  Next door to me there is a side-by-side duplex.  In that duplex, the closest to me is a family that I am neighborly with.  On the other side of them is a family that owns several cars and two Harleys.  The Harleys have very loud pipes.

When I am in the back yard, the decibel meter on my phone registers 85 decibels, and higher when they rev their engines.  When I am upstairs on my back porch, the dB reading is 75-80.  What bothers me is not the sound when they get on their bikes and drive away - I am bothered when they turn on the bikes and just let them run.  This morning, one of the guys turned on his bike and went inside letting it run for 5 minutes.  Sometimes, they turn on the bikes, then blast the radio so they can hear it over the noise of the bike, and proceed to rev the engines.  The noise is overwhelming.

I know their next door neighbors hate this, and the smell of the exhaust comes in their windows because of the parking allocation.  They are afraid of an altercation so don't say anything.

I don't want to go through another summer where I feel that I can't read a book in the back yard, or sit peacefully on my back porch.  I am considering complaining to their landlord.  Would that be an asshole thing to do?  I know their landlord is responsible and responsive, so it might be a solution, but I don't want to be a Karen about this.

79,1ca9cvn,AITA because I didn’t wanna do yard work?,"backstory: I 15f only met my dad 43m in June 2023 and 3 months ago moved from London to cairns Australia to live with him. The reason for this is that my mum and stepdad abused me my whole life. Public transport is terrible here- the bus comes every hour if they even show up. So I asked my dad if he could buy me a scooter and I would pay him back. However this was before I found out my visa doesn’t allow me to work but I still intend to pay him back however I can (probably selling art and craft at the market). My biggest fear is being completely dependant on someone which is why I really wanted the scooter because I didn’t like completely relying on my dad. 

Anyway so last week me and my dad planned to do yard work on Saturday however when he woke me up that morning (9am) I was extremely tired (I’d had a really hard week of school and it was the first week back from the holidays), so I wasn’t too enthusiastic about getting up. I don’t like waking up then immediately getting up but I did anyway because he really wanted me to get up. I got dressed then went outside but had no shoes on which he commented on so I went to put some on. He followed me to my room and said he’ll just do it on his own with an attitude and said I’m just like my mum. I put my shoes on then offered my help again and he denied it. So I spent the whole day in my room doing school work. The next morning I decide I’ll be the bigger person and apologise for not helping the day prior so I do and he says that an apology the next day isn’t good enough and that if I wanna ride my scooter from now on then I have to pay $20 everytime, which I think is unfair considering I offered to help twice and he said no. I ignored this and went to my room again for the day to do more schoolwork. Then the next day We had another argument about it with him essentially saying that he was gonna wipe my debt if I had helped him which he’s not doing now so I can “forget that” and that he’s bought me everything I needed or asked for since being here (let me clarify that this is things like clothes because I’ve had to change my dress sense since moving to this climate and a school laptop and money when I go out with friends and stuff. I’m honestly being 100% serious when I say I don’t remember asking for a lot of stuff which isn’t to say I didn’t though). My dad has anger issues and gets mad at me a lot for stupid reasons which he’s even admitted before. Because of my past I have a lot of self doubt when it comes to arguments and stuff so I felt I needed to turn to Reddit to ask… AITA?

Then the next day We had another argument about it with him essentially saying that he was gonna wipe my debt if I had helped him which he’s not doing now so I can “forget that” and that he’s bought me everything I needed or asked for since being here (let me clarify that this is things like clothes because I’ve had to change my dress sense since moving to this climate and a school laptop and money when I go out with friends and stuff. I’m honestly being 100% serious when I say I don’t remember asking for a lot of stuff which isn’t to say I didn’t though). My dad has anger issues and gets mad at me a lot for stupid reasons which he’s even admitted before. Because of my past I have a lot of self doubt when it comes to arguments and stuff so I felt I needed to turn to Reddit to ask… AITA? 

Also just to note i am fully aware that my dad is new to being a parent which I fully understand and am conscious of all the time which is why I don’t complain about him but I’m getting a bit sick of always suffering the backlash because of everyone else’s mistakes",4.0,0.10624476,0,0
80,1ca8qbv,AITA for arguing with a neighbour about them ruining our grass and bushes,"I live in a new condo building where we have our own pice of land for flower gardening and part of that land is covered with grass and decorative bushes. 
This little grass part with bushes is situated between our condo building , our parking spaces and neighbouring condo building with their grass land and parking spaces. 
Our condo building HO is paying monthly for that grass lawn and flowers maintenance. 
So the issue is that I noticed that on our part of the land some bushes are now broken and there are alot of empty spots where grass no longer is growing, because some one was walking from neighbours condo building side towards our parking spaces. 
Then i noticed that indeed every morning a-lot of neighbours from neighbouring building  one by one would just walk on that grass field, when there is a concrete road existing parallel to that grass field.

I wrote a complaint in our facebook condo group saying “hei, we have a problem, everyday someone is walking on our grass lawn, we should do something about it”. I offered to put some decorative fence maybe 0,5 meters high, someone else offered to put some more bushes. 
And then, theres this lady commenting my post, saying that we should give all the neighbours opportunity to walk where they wanna walk, because it is much convenient or shorter walk distance between main road and the building and that we should put a concrete road on that grass lawn. 
I figured that main people who were walking on that lawn are from neighbours condo building. 
I replied to that lady saying “hei we do not need unnecessary people trafic because we are too  close to main road, this will attract even more people to our parking spaces who are not supposed to walk there or be there. and there might be situations when people would try to drive trough on that concrete road by passing our parking gates and park without permit for example. 
then the lady replies that I am a bad neighbour for not letting them  walk on that grass. also it turns out that that lady is exactly from that neighbouring condo building. 
i dont know who gave her access to our group. in the end I replied to her that our HO meeting will decide  what we should do with this problem, but not her, because this is our condo building land and she is not part of our HO condo building. 
Now I kinda feel bad for making that post. and at the same time im thinking why should that concrete road have to be made only because she said so.

83,1ca8b9g,AITA for telling my mum to pull my brother out of school?,"I’m hoping you can help my mum (59yrs) and I (32yrs).

My brother (16yrs) has been skipping school. His education has been a massive issue for my mum and it’s causing her a lot of stress. She’ll ask for proof that he’s in school and he sends her a photo of his desk looking down at his laptop but she can’t tell if he’s in class or not. 

It’s a unique situation for my mum, as myself and my other 2 siblings (m27, f29) never had issues with schooling and we grew up respecting our teachers and parents. We’re not against going into a trade or dropping out of school.

He doesn’t take school seriously at all, and he used to go to a local private school where mum was paying $26k a year for him to attend. He failed the last 2 years of school, but because it was a private school, they cared more about taking her money rather than his education.

He’s a pretty arrogant teenager, he thinks he knows more than his teachers and even attempts to ‘correct’ his tests. He definitely got on the wrong side of a few teachers at his old school. He was ‘bullied’ there and asked mum to transfer to the local public school which is in the town centre.

Mum got an email earlier in the year that my brother had been skipping school and she confronted him and he said he’d just been wandering around town instead of going to class. On Friday, mum got another email from the school again that my brother hasn’t been in one of his classes for an entire month. We’re assuming that’s the case for all of his other classes as well.

My brother has no respect for my mother and doesn’t take any notice of her authority. She’s tried everything to punish him without crossing any lines. He’s completely unmotivated to do anything other than play on his computer. His laptop is his entire life, but we can’t take it off him because he needs it for all of his classes which post everything online.

Mums used the money she would have for the private school to pay for tutors for him, she’s given him her credit card to pay for lunches. She hasn’t noticed any purchases on it that aren’t food. She’s spent a lot of money recently on his schooling. For me, it feels like theft or financial abuse.

Last year, the three of us started organising a Euro trip for September, I’ve suggested that my brother not be invited anymore. I don’t want mum to ‘reward’ him for this behaviour.

Mum called me and asked for advice and I told her all of this, it’s not like he’s interested in school anyway. I am wondering though that if he did get a job, would he even turn up?

84,1ca8awe,AITA for telling my stepsister I won't attend her baby shower and I won't change my mind just because she keeps asking or sending invites,"I (26f) have a stepsister (18f) I have not seen in many, many years. She was so young when I last saw her. My relationship with my mom (her stepmom) was never a good one. She was never a good parent to me and when she decided to get married and settle down while also not attempting to be a good mom to me, I made the decision to fight hard to get my dad to win custody of me, which he did when I was 13. My mom was supposed to go to therapy and classes before the courts attempted to try reunification therapy for us. But she never took those steps so we never did the therapy together (and won't, I have zero desire to be part of her life).

I had a relationship with her parents and siblings, though not a close one. I was included by them though and would see my mom from a distance for a few years at occasional family gatherings. My stepsister would be there also and over time she became far closer to my maternal side than I was. My reason for not being very close to my maternal side is they would encourage me to give mom a chance and they would try and talk me into taking on the role of big sister for her stepdaughter because they knew my mom had zero desire to have any children at all and would not be having more and apparently her stepdaughter struggled with not having siblings, so they wanted me to fill that gap for her. I wasn't interested then and I'm not today. I don't hate the girl but simply put we are not family and I really had little to do with anyone from my mom's side in a good 4 years (since Covid).

I received a digital invite to the baby shower 3 weeks ago and I RSVP'd no. This was followed by another one, and followed by a message from my stepsister saying she wanted her baby's aunt to be there, and it followed another message begging me to change my mind and then another invitation that she personalized to ask me to be there and she told me not to bring a gift, just me, because I would be the real gift.

I told her I was not interested again and then I blocked her. But she followed me to another platform and then she begged and pleaded with me to change my mind. She said it wasn't too late for us to be sisters and for me to be her baby's aunt. I told her I won't attend her baby shower and I won't change my mind just because she keeps asking or sending invites. She told me she doesn't understand why I hate her and this interaction prompted contact from my maternal grandparents and they told me I shouldn't have been so cruel and if I really had to let her down, I should have made it way softer.

She told me she never wanna argue with me (she calls all disagreements arguments) because she said “you’re either right or we keep arguing.” whenever she wanna quit talking she just say yeah you’re right sorry as a way to shut me up. I don’t wanna be right, most times I just wanna be heard and understand her side so we will be able to see where the other is coming from but again she refuses to explain what’s on her mind. It became a pattern where she says “you’re right, sorry” to shut me up and we move past it. I don’t want the topic to end but she will be calling me out for it saying I’m prolonging the fight.

She said “you’re surprised by the build up you caused and suddenly you wanna take out everything and fix it and organize it.” when in fact I’ve been trying but she’s been shutting me up. I’m not saying I’ve done nothing wrong, I make mistakes as to why I ask her about it. Hence the talks, but to her it’s an argument. She doesn’t say where I went wrong btw. So now I think or assume she’s holding grudges from all the past mistakes I’ve made. Saying she’s tired of it and doesn’t wanna talk about ANY conflict she just wants normal conversations. How can I continue to have normal conversations when I know there’s underlying problems in the relationship? 

I want to fix things because I want to spend the rest of my life with this person. We tackle problems the opposite way. I wanna fix and talk about it head on but she prefers ignoring and moving on from it.

She’s the avoidant type and I’m the anxious type. It bugs me that she doesn’t want to talk. She’s growing colder unless I give her the normal talk and move past the problems. I asked her to meet me halfway many times where we will talk about stuff like this in the future when we’re both comfortable to do so but she says “no we won’t because i don’t want to. either stop talking about it or don’t talk to me at all” 

She’s not wanting to break off the relationship either because I asked her multiple times whether she wants to still be with me, if she’s unhappy, if she lost interest, and if she lost feelings. She tells me to just quit talking about it, move on, and talk to her normally.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,"AITA. I’m pushing conversation with my fiancée about our past disagreements/problems so that we can find a way to resolve them For the past years it has been nice and quiet. Recently when a disagreement occurred she has become more distant and avoidant of conflict which she has always been, never been the type to wanna solve the problem. When I ask to talk about the problem we had or something wrong I did in hopes of correcting my mistakes or doing better next time, she refuses and tells me to stop talking about it and move on. I’m trying to be better for her but how do I better myself if she won’t call me out on things she find upsetting or pisses her off?

89,1ca77ns,WIBTA to use my period as an excuse to not participate in my cousin’s wedding?,"Greetings everyone!  My cousin is getting married this Saturday and asked me if I can be part of my bridal entrance… I am thinking of backing out and using my period as an excuse.  

Cindy (29/F) has a Hindu wedding this Saturday.  We are not particularly close and never were growing up: my grandparents (paternal) played favorites and treated my parents, my sibling and I the worst.  Evidenced by things we heard in the family, stealing our inheritance from our great grandparents, how they treated us, etc.  My mom had enough and moved us abroad and life is GREAT for all of us since we took a step away from dad’s side.  My grandma tried to connect us all again - we were uninterested.  


Years pass, I connect with Cindy in 2015.  We are cordial, however we don’t have a bond or common interest.  Another cousin, Rudy, tells me that Cindy and her sister Annie, talks TERRIBLY about random people and family on Facebook (keep this in mind for later). Rudy and I that that is rather weird and rude. 

In 2023, Cindy is engaged and announces her wedding. For whatever reason, my grandma kept giving me wrong dates multiple times and when I asked Cindy, she mentioned that invites will come soon and just wait.  I asked her for at least a save the date since I started a new job and would like to plan properly and I live abroad.  


The wedding in April and the invite was sent February, received LATE February.   The airfares were expensive and I mentioned to my grandma (WITHOUT THE INTENTION OF ASKING FOR $) that I am going to have to politely decline as it’s both out of my budget and too close for me to ask for time off (4 day wedding).  Grandma sends me $ to the airfare KNOWING I would only be there for the Saturday and Sunday, saying it would be “disappointing if you don’t show up at least to represent your side”. And because Cindy and I were friendly, I wanted to make a good faith effort. Even if I wasn’t attending, I planned to give her $$ as a gift.  Cindy asks me to be part of her bridal entry - I think foolishly, “wow, this is nice. I’m glad we’re good!”

My mother, who happened to be visiting her family, heard from a relative who also distanced themselves from my grandparents and Cindy’s family - that Cindy and her mom speaks EXTREMELY poorly of me and my mother.  Her mother and Cindy both doubt my career as a physician (I can provide proof btw) and says “look at her Facebook what doctor acts like that” (referring to me dressing up and traveling with my partner who is a successful attorney and me being pro-choice/a LBGTQ+ ally/pro therapy to name a few). 

Hearing this hurt me deeply as I believed Cindy was being sincere and I am considering withdrawing my agreement to be part of her bridal entry using the excuse my period is expected this Saturday (day of the wedding and the actual truth too). 

WIBTA for backing out?

Want to add: the person my mother spoke to has NEVER ever met Rudi nor do they have any relation.

91,1ca6uav,AITA for telling my sister she should listen to the therapist who told her to wait a few more years and live apart?,"My sister and her kids have been going to therapy for the past four months. My sister lost her husband 3 years ago and started dating again 2 years ago. Now she's engaged to a guy (Kev) and he's living with her and the kids. The kids are 11, 8 and 7. My sister had this idea that the kids would be crazy about Kev and would be so excited to have another man around and that they'd think of him as another dad figure/second dad/bonus dad or however people prefer to title it. Kev does seem like a pretty decent guy from what I know of him. But I also know the older two kids remember their dad really well (he was actually the SAHP in the relationship) and the youngest despite being 4 when his dad died also has some memories of him, so it's not easy for them to accept Kev being there. The kids pulled back from my sister after she told them she was dating someone and they were very closed off with Kev when they met. Despite this they moved in together and got engaged.

My sister decided they needed therapy together because the kids would try to stay out of the way after Kev moved in. They weren't enthusiastic about time with her or with Kev. If they weren't at a friends house or playing outside, they would hold up in their rooms. My sister tried coaxing them out but she knew they were just not interested and so she started going to therapy with them to figure stuff out.

It became clear in therapy through the kids opening up (and my sister had to leave the room for this to happen) that they are having a very hard time with their mom being with Kev. All three kids said they'd rather be left behind than brought forward the way their mom is moving forward. They're also very fearful that Kev will be as involved as their dad was and they don't want that. They don't want him being their parent or taking care of them.

After maybe three months of therapy my sister was told by the therapist that her recommendation would be for her and Kev to live separately and not get married for a few more years and for her to focus on her role as the kids' mom. She told her it would be better for the kids. She also told her it would be the easiest way for them and Kev to have a friendly and maybe even close relationship in the future.

My sister really didn't like hearing this. She vented to me about it twice and then she asked me what she should do and she told me she really wanted to hear my thoughts. So I told her I thought she should listen to the therapist because I agreed with what she said. She asked me why and I brought up some family friends we've had since childhood where the dad remarried after his wife died and the kids from the first marriage felt it was too fast and are very distant from the family today. I told her I would hate to see that happen with her and the kids. She was upset hearing this from me. Then she got mad and told me I should encourage her to follow her heart on this.

I (19m) live alone, almost a paycheck to paycheck because i quite frankly and stupidly spend it on my car which i like to work on, ofcourse on my free time. My friend Mark (fake name) m20 asked me to help him babysit his younger brother 7m, because he did not want to be alone for almost 6 hours watching him. I said yes and we were talking on the dinner table about what is going on in our lives and his little brother asked if i have any games on my phone. I said yes, he asked if he can play and i gave him my phone to play, i showed him what he can play.

He then downloaded a game i was not aware of this and he did spend over 60 euros on it. I had 95 euros on my account for the rest of the month. When i noticed it the next day, i messaged Mark. Mark said that its not his problem to pay for that kind of things and i should have been more carefull with what i let his brother do. He also said that i was acting like an asshole for asking him to pay like that.

 I am a bit conflicted because his brother is a young kid so he might now have been aware of his doings. So am i the asshole?

Edit/update. I'm not sure how to answer to people in the comments really so i'll just answer on this for most. I took your advice and contacted the google play stores support and the game support. They will not be returning my money as it has been ""over 3 hours of the purchase"". 
I did contact my friend's parents and had a talk with them, they were not really understanding of it at first but did realise the mistake and paid me back the 60 euros. Thank you all for your advice and i have decided based on some info to not continue the friendship with Mark. I appreciate all of the advice.

after that I distanced myself away from her until we seen each other at a party and she tried to pressure me into taking a substance with her which i refused multiple times, she then got mad and started screaming at me in-front of everyone basically saying “why did you come here if you’re going to be a loser and not take drugs? might as well go home” i obviously was embarrassed so i went home and completely avoided her as much as i could.

95,1ca6380,AITA for calling a car rental company to tell them to move a piss-poor car parking job?,"So, I arrived off a 10 and a half hour flight the other day into Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport. I was terribly jet lagged. My dad was there to pick me up and we walked to the car park together.

Now, I must admit that I have no idea how rental car returns worked in Bangkok because each one of my family members has their own car (long story short, not having to pay for parking plus poor public transport leads to high car ownership)

So we get to my dad’s car, which has a pick-up truck parked in front of it without the handbrake on, so I go to the back to check how far I can push this car until I see this awful park job in the black Honda. He is double parked without any pride or care.

Because AITA doesn’t allow images, let me visualise it here:

It’s 6:30am in the morning, everyone is tired and jet lagged, and I tell them “okay I’m going to call the rental company so that they can get someone to move this asshole’s car.” 

My dad for some reason puts up a massive fuss and starts yelling “why do you have to get involved?” 
I told him “well for fuck’s sake, this is such a simple solve and much easier than calling the airport to get the car towed. It’s not the rental car’s problem that the asshole parked like that but at least they can quickly solve it.”

So I called the rental company (we knew it was a rental because of the number plate cover)
“Hi, your customer parked a black Honda, registration 5844 absolutely appalling at the top floor of Car Park 3 in Bangkok airport. Could you get one of your staff members to move it?” I assumed that this asshole was returning the car.

Well, turns out the car was still being rented but the operator told me that she would call the renter to move their car.

My dad for some reason has a massive problem with me trying to fix issues “that don’t relate to us.” Or “getting involved in other people’s business.” I thought it would be a good idea because there was another driver that had to manoeuvre around the asshole with  quite a lot of difficulty and I felt really bad for him.

I do understand that everyone was tired and couldn’t be bothered at the time as well, but I felt like it was an easy fix.

Additional info: in Thai and Chinese culture it’s a bit of a taboo to “meddle in other people’s business” or bother yourself with something that doesn’t involve you. My dad is still quite traditional, while I am more international (lived in other countries before)

Was I the asshole for calling the car rental company (I assumed it would’ve been an easy fix for them to move the car since it’s literally at the airport) or should i have just “minded my own business?”

96,1ca61qb,AITA for asking my roommate’s mom when she plans to end her stay with us after her apartment was flooded?,"My (21 F) roommate’s (22 F) mother has been staying with us after there was a small flood in her apartment. Nothing was seriously damaged, especially since she had been home at the time and managed to mop up most of the water with towels and blankets. However when it happened my roommate told me her mom needs to stay with us a couple of nights while it was sorted. I was fine with a couple of nights, as it was a bad thing that happened to her and she is my roommate’s family and needed somewhere to stay. 

However when her mom showed up, her mom told me that her landlord had actually offered for her to stay at a hotel under his cost, as the flooding was due to plumbing issues within the house. I was a little confused as to why she chose to stay in our little two bedroom apartment instead of a hotel, but I figured she may just want to be near her daughter with all the stress. 

It has not been a couple of nights. She is coming up to her eighth night of being here. She has also been an incredibly rude house guest (I’ve made previous posts about this woman’s behaviour actually) she has been loud late at night,(which is frustrating for me who needs to get up early in the morning to work 10-12 hour shifts) causing a lot of dishes and not cleaning them, taking long hot showers multiple times a day, leaving the heater on full blast, lounging around watching tv at times I would like to, constantly in the kitchen or bathroom when I need to be. Even when I need to get ready for work in the morning, almost every morning she is in the bathroom for 20 minutes during times I need to be. Every time I ask her to get out she says “I’ll just be a few more minutes!” And stays in there for a while longer. When my roommate and I go to work, she sits around in our apartment as she’s unemployed so she doesn’t need to go to work. 

I have spoken to her about things several times. Asked her to not be in the bathroom when I need to be, asked her to do her dishes, asked her to turn the heater off when it isn’t necessary. We live in a very expensive city, so since my rent is already expensive I don’t exactly want a super high power bill either. She has also offered no kind of gesture of appreciation to me.

97,1ca5plt,AITA snapping at my music director?,"Hey y’all! I’m a college student and this week is our finals week. I’ve got 5 finals plus a jury (solo performance for the music faculty) and an ensemble concert (last night! We’re a non traditional group just because of our school size). To make a long story short, we were originally scheduled to play on Friday but the theater double booked with us for their play so we were forced to change to tonight. 

My music director is an incredible person, but he gets a lot of crap from students because he’s so different from the director we had last year. I think it’s been a hard transition for some students. I love them both for unique ways and I always try to show that I appreciate what he does for us as students. He even paid for pizza for all of us last night so we didn’t have to figure out our own dinner. 

Last night, our call time pre concert was set for 4pm (the concert was at 7pm). I spent the whole day beforehand studying for my first final exam and it wasn’t as productive as I would’ve liked. My agitation about the exam consumed a lot of my mind even during our rehearsal. Somehow the topic of tear down came up because the jury performances I mentioned previously are in the morning, and we had tons of equipment on stage for our concert. He mentioned staying after the concert or coming in early tomorrow to tear down, and I think I sort of snapped. I basically said, “I’ve divested enough time into this as it is, it’s hard enough for me being here at 4 today.” He asked what I was saying and I just said that I didn’t think I could help with tear down. He didn’t address me anymore after that, everyone voted on which time would work better for them (I stood aside), the night went on, and nothing else out of the ordinary happened. We even interacted with each other just fine after that.

I can’t stop thinking about the way that my frustration came out. I could’ve just said that I have too much studying to do, that I don’t have time, but instead I think I made it seem like our ensemble that my professor has worked so hard on doesn’t matter to me. At the same time, I really don’t have any more time to put into the ensemble and I don’t plan on helping tear down in the morning.

101,1ca3i3w,"AITA for ""abandoning"" my step daughter?","Hello all. I (43 F) have been married to my husband, George, (45M) for about a year now, and it's been wonderful! Except for one thing. His daughter, Rachel, (15F) can't stand me.

Ever since we got married, George has been pushing ""family trips"" and ""quality time"" between me and Rachel. I have no problem with it on paper, but Rachel does. George and Rachel have gotten into many an argument over the fact that Rachel doesn't like me or want a relationship with me. Rachel says I'm not her mom, will never be, and that she won't pretend I am.

I've been conflicted on what to do. On one hand, George is Rachel's parent, not me, so I don't really get a say in what rules he puts on her. On the other hand, I hate seeing Rachel so miserable every time we go out on a girls trip or are sent for bonding time by George.

So I made a decision. I sat George down and explained I wasn't comfortable with these family trips anymore. I explained that Rachel would always have a place in our home (this is where her dad lives, after all, she belongs here as much as i do), and that of course I'd be there if she *asked* to spend time together, needed something, or if there was an emergency and I had to take care of her. But I wouldn't be going on these outings anymore because I was uncomfortable with how upset they were making Rachel.

George was pissed. He accused me of undermining his parenting decisions and abandoning Rachel by refusing to fight for our family. I replied that I *wasn't* part of Rachel's family! She doesn't like me! She's made it clear I'll never be her mother! So I didn't see the point in forcing her to have ""mommy-daughter spa days"" and whatever else with me against her will!

George told me I needed to reevaluate my priorities if I wanted to stay together and accused me of wanting to cut his daughter out of our family before storming out. I'm gutted. Of course I don't want to cut Rachel out of our lives or family! She's George's daughter, I know she'll always come first to him, and I'd never want to sabotage their relationship or hurt her! But that's why I don't want to keep forcing a bond between us! Because *that's* hurting her and putting a wedge between them!

I don't know. Did I overstep? Am I really hurting Rachel or our family by putting my foot down here? I love George, and I care about Rachel, so whatever the judgment is, I'll accept it. I just want to do what's best for everyone!

EDIT: Briefly editing to ask people to please please not be rude to Rachel. Most people here have been supportive of both her and me, which I appreciate, but a few people have called her a brat and similar such things. Rachel is generally well behaved and hasn't done anything drastic or overly disruptive, she's just a kid who's a bit standoffish and sarcastic sometimes because she's hurting over her parents divorce and not seeing George enough.

  
**EDIT/UPDATE:** 

Okay. A lot of you gave the advice that I should talk to Rachel so we can present a united front to George and show that neither of us wanted this. I sat Rachel down this morning and gently broached the subject with her. 

I explained that I knew she wasn't looking for a mom, that she already had one, and that was okay. I told her that I didn't need her to see me as a mother, or even like me. She was a smart and well behaved kid and she deserved to have a say in who she wants a relationship with. I told her that I was with her 100% in what she wanted, and that we could talk to George together, because I was going to follow her lead no matter what. 

Rachel got kinda quiet for a minute and then her face just...crumbled. She told me she didn't hate me at all, that I was nice to her and seemed interested in her life. The real problem was, in her words, that she wished her parents were too. 

I'll be honest, that broke my heart. I had to try very hard not to tear up in front of her, because this was the first time she'd opened up to me or given any indication she even liked me at all, and I didn't want to ruin that by putting my emotions first. I did my best to comfort her, and promised Rachel that I was here for her in any way she needed.

I'm going to have a talk with George. First by myself (rachel is scared to talk to him), and then potentially with Rachel so she can speak for herself, if George is receptive. I'm also going to push George to get therapy (individual and also couples, potentially with rachel too if she wants to). More than anything, I'll keep trying to be there for Rachel. I know I'm not her mom, and I'm not expecting her to suddenly start acting like we're best friends. But I know now that my efforts are appreciated by her, and that only makes me more determined to advocate for and support her however she's comfortable with.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,"AITA for ""abandoning"" my step daughter?

I've been conflicted on what to do. On one hand, George is Rachel's parent, not me, so I don't really get a say in what rules he puts on her. On the other hand, I hate seeing Rachel so miserable every time we go out on a girls trip or are sent for bonding time by George.

So I made a decision. I sat George down and explained I wasn't comfortable with these family trips anymore. I explained that Rachel would always have a place in our home (this is where her dad lives, after all, she belongs here as much as i do), and that of course I'd be there if she *asked* to spend time together, needed something, or if there was an emergency and I had to take care of her. But I wouldn't be going on these outings anymore because I was uncomfortable with how upset they were making Rachel.

George was pissed. He accused me of undermining his parenting decisions and abandoning Rachel by refusing to fight for our family. I replied that I *wasn't* part of Rachel's family! She doesn't like me! She's made it clear I'll never be her mother! So I didn't see the point in forcing her to have ""mommy-daughter spa days"" and whatever else with me against her will!

George told me I needed to reevaluate my priorities if I wanted to stay together and accused me of wanting to cut his daughter out of our family before storming out. I'm gutted. Of course I don't want to cut Rachel out of our lives or family! She's George's daughter, I know she'll always come first to him, and I'd never want to sabotage their relationship or hurt her! But that's why I don't want to keep forcing a bond between us! Because *that's* hurting her and putting a wedge between them!

I don't know. Did I overstep? Am I really hurting Rachel or our family by putting my foot down here? I love George, and I care about Rachel, so whatever the judgment is, I'll accept it. I just want to do what's best for everyone!

EDIT: Briefly editing to ask people to please please not be rude to Rachel. Most people here have been supportive of both her and me, which I appreciate, but a few people have called her a brat and similar such things. Rachel is generally well behaved and hasn't done anything drastic or overly disruptive, she's just a kid who's a bit standoffish and sarcastic sometimes because she's hurting over her parents divorce and not seeing George enough.

  
**EDIT/UPDATE:** 

Okay. A lot of you gave the advice that I should talk to Rachel so we can present a united front to George and show that neither of us wanted this. I sat Rachel down this morning and gently broached the subject with her. 

I explained that I knew she wasn't looking for a mom, that she already had one, and that was okay. I told her that I didn't need her to see me as a mother, or even like me. She was a smart and well behaved kid and she deserved to have a say in who she wants a relationship with. I told her that I was with her 100% in what she wanted, and that we could talk to George together, because I was going to follow her lead no matter what. 

Rachel got kinda quiet for a minute and then her face just...crumbled. She told me she didn't hate me at all, that I was nice to her and seemed interested in her life. The real problem was, in her words, that she wished her parents were too. 

I'll be honest, that broke my heart. I had to try very hard not to tear up in front of her, because this was the first time she'd opened up to me or given any indication she even liked me at all, and I didn't want to ruin that by putting my emotions first. I did my best to comfort her, and promised Rachel that I was here for her in any way she needed.

I'm going to have a talk with George. First by myself (rachel is scared to talk to him), and then potentially with Rachel so she can speak for herself, if George is receptive. I'm also going to push George to get therapy (individual and also couples, potentially with rachel too if she wants to). More than anything, I'll keep trying to be there for Rachel. I know I'm not her mom, and I'm not expecting her to suddenly start acting like we're best friends. But I know now that my efforts are appreciated by her, and that only makes me more determined to advocate for and support her however she's comfortable with.",0.0,1.0640098,1,0
102,1ca2wdp,AITA for not letting my older brother use my computer?,"So, my (f14) older half brother (m34) is currently trying to apply for jobs because his current job is in his field but not at the level he wants to be at. However, the applications for what he's trying to apply for (a paramedic firefighter position, what our dad did for 26 years) requires the resume to be made and the application filled out through Microsoft word. My brother has a macbook that doesn't have word, and his wife has the same thing. My dad doesn't have a computer and my mom has another macbook. 

But my dad (m58) got me a gaming laptop for christmas and I absolutely love it. I use it for everything and prefer it to using my phone whenever possible so most of my friends (both online and irl) message me through discord and i'm a part of a few servers. because it's a gaming laptop, it runs on windows. So because of this, my dad wants to let my brother use my laptop to fill out his application and resume. 

but the thing is, i dont have the full version of word and only have the (currently unused) free trial available that i've been saving for a day when i need it for a school assignment or college application or something. but him using my free trial isn't even my main issue. my main issue is that when my brother comes over to use my computer, it's probably going to be while i'm at school and cant be sure that he's only accessing that one part of my computer. 

i think it's also important to note that i barely know my brother. he's twenty years older than me and he's only ever lived in the same city as me in the past year. we do not have the same bond as i do with my sister. if it has been her asking, i wouldve just silenced my discord notifications so she couldn't see my texts pop up but otherwise leave it alone. but with my brother i am not nearly comfortable with him to let him have unfiltered access to my laptop and all of my files, search history, texts, and everything else.

He's been coming around to our porch, stealing food and going through our trash (and snuggling) for a few days. I told myself that if I saw him again, I was going to take responsibility and keep him here. I've been trying to find the owner, and plan to go to the Humane Society tomorrow as soon as they open.

I went to the store and bought him everything he needs -- a sleeping kennel (no idea if he's housebroken), treats, good food, chew toys, etc. On my way back, a friend who lives across the highway called to tell me that they've been feeding him, he's been sleeping on their porch at night, and that they've claimed him if they can't find an owner. For two weeks they haven't taken him to the Humane Society, haven't kept him in place to ensure his safety crossing the busy highway to come to our house, or done any other tangible thing that would have told me this was the case. They want me to bring him back, and are saying that they will make the lifestyle changes to keep him from wandering off again. I have dubious feelings about the longevity of this commitment, but fully believe their sincerity in this moment.

It's bumping up on every single ""good girl"" wound in me, my need for acceptance and my subconscious desire to be obedient and do what they want me to do so they will like me. But I don't think this is about me -- it's about the dog.

I don't believe its in the best interests of the dog I (and my partner and daughter) have also come to care about. I feel responsible for him. I also have a lifestyle (self employed) that allows the dog to be with me most of the time, and have started training him. I have a friend next door whose dog we kinda co-parent (I watch him often when she's gone, and she often drops him at my studio when she's working so he can hang out with me and go on walks). The two dogs get along super well, and she's committed to helping me co-parent him for however long I have him.

On the other hand, in their eyes I took the dog they claimed and their kids are attached to. They will think I'm mean, a bad guy, and/or unreasonable if I don't give him back.

He's been coming around to our porch, stealing food and going through our trash (and snuggling) for a few days. I told myself that if I saw him again, I was going to take responsibility and keep him here. I've been trying to find the owner, and plan to go to the Humane Society tomorrow as soon as they open.

I went to the store and bought him everything he needs -- a sleeping kennel (no idea if he's housebroken), treats, good food, chew toys, etc. On my way back, a friend who lives across the highway called to tell me that they've been feeding him, he's been sleeping on their porch at night, and that they've claimed him if they can't find an owner. For two weeks they haven't taken him to the Humane Society, haven't kept him in place to ensure his safety crossing the busy highway to come to our house, or done any other tangible thing that would have told me this was the case. They want me to bring him back, and are saying that they will make the lifestyle changes to keep him from wandering off again. I have dubious feelings about the longevity of this commitment, but fully believe their sincerity in this moment.

It's bumping up on every single ""good girl"" wound in me, my need for acceptance and my subconscious desire to be obedient and do what they want me to do so they will like me. But I don't think this is about me -- it's about the dog.

I don't believe its in the best interests of the dog I (and my partner and daughter) have also come to care about. I feel responsible for him. I also have a lifestyle (self employed) that allows the dog to be with me most of the time, and have started training him. I have a friend next door whose dog we kinda co-parent (I watch him often when she's gone, and she often drops him at my studio when she's working so he can hang out with me and go on walks). The two dogs get along super well, and she's committed to helping me co-parent him for however long I have him.

On the other hand, in their eyes I took the dog they claimed and their kids are attached to. They will think I'm mean, a bad guy, and/or unreasonable if I don't give him back.

Aita.

  
EDITED TO ADD: He has a collar but no tags. Our first priority is finding the owner, so we are going to the shelter in the off chance he's microchipped. And would be happy to keep him if we can't find them. He's also not fixed. We live in rural North Carolina, and there's a very... hmm... loose culture with dogs here.",0.0,0.02204318,0,1

113,1ca1zw7,AITA for asking a kid to move his jacket?,"We have a park near our house, lots of kids use it, and today my family and I visited with our two young children.  Two boys playing on the disability swing,  (rather dangerously I might add, as the one pushing would after a shove, then lay flat on the ground to ""try to have the other boy swing over him"".)  One had a jacket in the baby swing next to him.  

I saw this as a huge breach of play ground etiquette, as putting your stuff in a place that someone has to take out to use it is, very rude and not kind. Such as the baby swing, it isn't a basket for your stuff.  

I turned to the boys not knowing who's jacket it was and said, is that jacket one of yours?  Can you please not put it there, and maybe put it on the table that's under the pavilion.  While they did move it, they soon left the disability swing and he once again leaves his jacket behind on the swing. 

They run off to play on the slides and the adult with them then calls them over to take them home, my daughter is currently swinging now in the baby swing, and I'm not going to leave her or take her out to confront the adult with them.  Instead when the kid comes back to pick up his jacket to take it home with him, I tell him again  not to leave his jacket on the swings, it's not kind to other people.   He tells me that no one ever uses that swing, and I replied back ""You literally just used that swing, so someone used it"".  He then tells the adult with him that I'm being rude to him.  

My husband thinks I shouldn't have said anything,  but it irks me that people this child's age need to be prepared that places like the park have rules and society isn't going to put up with your crap just because your parents do.  

I understand I'm not in any real sense responsible for this child or his behavior, but I think it's important that people be held accountable for their actions.   If you block a swing that you can't use with your stuff thinking it's ok because it's not useful for you limits other people's access.  

I don't even like that he was using the disability swing, or that they were playing so recklessly, but I only addressed the jacket in the baby swing issue because it was very clear that he really had no use for it other than to hold his jacket.  


Other people had young children who also wanted to use that swing but no one felt confident to either remove the jacket or confront the boy about it.  

So maybe I am the asshole, but can you be like a right one?  Is there like a legal ramifications for telling a kid to move his stuff?  If not why do people let kids get a way with this stuff.  I kept my cool but the kid then started bad mouthing to me and about me.  I ignored him, but golly, what is the real lesson anyone learned from this?  Basically some mom with a kid was rude to him.

114,1ca1wpt,AITA for telling my mom she can rent a room in my house?,"Me(M24) and my girlfriend(F23) have been together for about 6 and half years. She moved in with me year 2, at that time I was living with my single mom. We all lived together for 2 years in a 2 bedroom apartment (I was 18-19 at the time and paid half the rent to my mom). Me and my gf decided to move into our own little one bedroom apartment and my mom did the same. When we were in our own apartment, it was ALWAYS clean, my girlfriend would be a clean freak, she would cook every night and she was just generally a lot happier living alone (without my mom).

 Year 4, we decided to move back in with my mom, instead of us paying a separate rent, and my mom paying a separate rent, we would conjoin our rents and get a big house. I quickly noticed that after about 3-4 months of living with my mom at the house again, my girlfriend was less happy, I would do all the cleaning, she would rarely help clean or cook. 

At the end of year 4 I sat my gf down and asked if everything is okay. She explained that she has been unmotivated to do anything because my mom has a very cluttered lifestyle, and everytime she wants to do anything in the house, it overwhelms her. I didn’t  disagree with her, me and my gf both like a minimalistic lifestyle, our furniture is simple and elegant, we like the modern style. My mom on the other hand, well she’s middle eastern, glass china cabinets in the living room with decorative china inside, multiple glass cabinets for displaying stuff, 3 coffee tables for a 3 piece sofa set, overall very busy house. 

This is now year 6, our lease is up very soon, and I talked to my mom about the living situation. I told her that my gf and I are a little unhappy with the current living situation, the clutter is making us not wanna be in the living room or shared areas at all, we usually just stay in the bedroom, and that we are planning on living alone again. 

My mom is in her early 60s, she’s been a single parent for about 16 years, she works a shit ton of hours, I offered her to stay with me and my gf, rent free, because I want her to work less and not worry about rent, but I don’t want any of her clutter in the house, I want me and my gf to decorate the house, and have our minimalistic furniture. I told her she can obviously enjoy all amenities of the house, just not all of her stuff in the house. I told her I’m willing to put all of her stuff in storage for her. 

She started crying and told me that she’d rather just go get an apartment, where she can actually put all of her stuff there, decorate and do whatever she wants. 

Now I feel like shit, I don’t know what to do. If I lean towards my gf, my mom is mad at me and is upset and sad, if I lean towards my mom, and my gf will be upset and sad.

I had a bag a brussle sprouts and was told to put it back because it was already too much food they said they had food from a restaurant we frequent. Fine. No problem. 
I had other stuff to eat at home besides it was fine. 

  So I get home and I start preparing to heat up dinner and what normally is like 6 prices of catfish, 4 fried shrimp some fries and hushpuppies what we normally get. I opened the box to see a single piece of catfish, a single shrimp and a single onion ring.

I had a bag a brussle sprouts and was told to put it back because it was already too much food they said they had food from a restaurant we frequent. Fine. No problem. 
I had other stuff to eat at home besides it was fine. 

  So I get home and I start preparing to heat up dinner and what normally is like 6 prices of catfish, 4 fried shrimp some fries and hushpuppies what we normally get. I opened the box to see a single piece of catfish, a single shrimp and a single onion ring.

Me and my best friend 20f have been talking about me moving over there, a state thats cheaper even though the wage is lower. The main reason want to move is my parents, I love my parents, but I feel like ever since I was born every decision Ive made has to be run by my parents first, I have never had a chance to do what I want, I was even sent to a trade school to become a MA, being in this field is not for me, dont get me wrong the whole experience was fun to learn, but its too stress for me

But my parents and job arent the only things, I hate every single thing about my life in California, my job, my life, my religion, I hate everything that goes on in my life. And my parents dont understand that the only thing that has kept me going is my best friend, even when I was at the losest point in my life, but she has helped me through all of it, shes even told me to go to therapy, but every single thing shes helped me with my mom thought it was a bad idea

My mom was confused why I needed therapy, why I needed antidepressants, which both have been helping so much. However, a big reason I hate my life is because of my religion, especially the people in the church. My pastor, my parents have been telling my that god has been blessing my life and been helping me, saying that ""Living underneath the pew"" was a blessing.

There are so many times I want to leave this religion, to leave this state so that everything that happened in my childhood just goes away, but to me it wont go away if I don't leave this state, my parents will still make me go to church, my mom will continue to ask when I'll have kids, when I'll get married, I don't want to get married, I dont want to have kids. And to those who think that since Im young I still need time to think over those ""rash"" decisions

My parents have been asking when I'll have kids since I was 14 and never been in a relationship

She then makes me sleep downstairs alone when the rest of the girls are sleeping in her room upstairs. 

Saturday was the worst day when we went out for drinks and when we started to go to different bars, the bride was already drunk, didn’t have her phone and kept running off in a jammed packed bar in Nashville.

126,1c9zv7a,AITA for not wanting to stay at my in-laws? ,"My husband ""Rob"" (33M) and I (29F)  live in my hometown and we visit my in-laws once a month as they live 4 hours away. My husband used to live with them but moved after we got married. I like my in-laws although I don't like staying at their house as I've found mice and roaches on multiple occasions. However, when I visit I don't mention it and have just talked about it with my husband. 

Yesterday I told to my husband we should go visit his mom for Mother's Day. Rob's parents are doing some home repairs so the bedroom we usually stay in is not available and we would have to sleep in a very uncomfortable spare room.

I told Rob we could stay at a hotel this time and that I would pay for it. He mentioned he would think about it as he rather stay at his parents to spend more time with them, so he would consider going on a different date.

My sister has a performance that weekend but she called today to ask if she should get us tickets so I asked my husband if he had an answer as to when we'd  visit my MIL. If he said we were not going on that weekend, then I would get tickets to go see my sister perform. He told me he wasn't sure about it and that it would be better for him to go alone to see his parents so I could go see my sister. 

I mentioned Rob it was more important for me to go see my in-laws as I know I can catch my sister performance in another date, so he should not be concerned about my sister's performance at all. He replied to me that if it was his sister who was performing (he has a twin btw who moved countries) he wouldn't miss the performance. 

I asked Rob if he didn't want me to come to see his parents and he started saying that I was the one not wanting to see his parents as I was not willing to stay I  the spare room. 

I got really hurt as I was the one bringing in the idea to visit them in Mother's Day and I had also bought my MIL a present already and my husband knows about it. 

We started to fight as I told him if he didn't want me to come with him he should have been clear since the beginning and he kept saying I was the one not willing to comply and stay at their parents home. 

I started crying as I felt that I'm not his priority, as he is not willing to comply just this time. He replied he is doing so as he cares about my finances and that I was exaggerating.

We had a dog growing up and my parents kept it outside in a “pen” 24/7, 365 days a year, for 15 years with no exercise or mental stimulation, and still to this day think it was fine. Since the day I moved out I have had my own dogs, and just got a puppy after losing my boy dog over the summer who was 11. 

My kids (3&5) , husband(33M) and I are animal people. I’ve worked in animal care for 15 years working in dog daycare, boarding, pet supplies, dog trainer and vet tech. My parents have always resisted my love for animals and have always had a boundary that my dogs are not allowed over. For a long period of time that was fine… I lived close by and my dogs were comfortable being left home for long periods of time, so it was easy for me to leave them home and go for a visit. 

Now, I live over an hour away with a 3 month old puppy who can only be left a few hours at a time. I got a different breed this time which is much more people oriented than my last dog and it’s taking longer to build comfort being left alone. I am not comfortable having someone come and pet sit as I also have an elderly dog with specific care that’s needed and lots of supervision is required between the two dogs right now. I would just not be comfortable with it. I also will not send our puppy to boarding/daycare, I am very familiar with the facilities around here and simply won’t use them, plus our puppy doesn’t have all of his shots yet. I am putting some serious hard work into training this puppy to be the best dog he can be. 

My husband is traveling for work this week and my parents said my kids and I should come over for a visit. I mentioned that I would love to, but that I would have to decline because I wasn’t willing to leave our puppy home for that long. My parents got angry, saying I was preventing them from seeing the kids. I said I was respecting their boundary and unfortunately it comes with the consequence of visits being harder and less frequent, but that I am happy with my choice and this is my lifestyle.

137,1c9yv5r,"AITA for ignoring my mom's messages?
","I moved out of my family's house 8 years ago. I've been supporting myself and helping my mom with her car insurance payment every year and occasionally sending her money whenever I can. True be told, she does help me with some money every now and then as well. On my vacations, instead of using the money (when there's enough) to travel somewhere nice, I always go to her house so I can spend time with her and my family. I always say I'll stay for just a week but end up staying longer than that.
In this 8 years, she visited me a total of 5 times and mostly because she can get medical appointments here through her insurance which was the case this time.
She came on Sunday, we went to her appointments on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning. From her appointment on Wednesday we went straight to the hospital so I could get admitted for a small surgery that I had scheduled . I got released that very same day by evening, we came home and she was scheduled to leave on Friday. On Thursday, I asked her to stay one more day (I wasn't in a lot of pain, but it was uncomfortable and weird since I never had any kind of surgery before). She said she couldn't because she had left her dogs with my uncle and he had hurts his feet. I asked her again on Friday and She gave me the same response, saying the she needed to pick up her dogs because she was already left them with my uncle for too long (mind you, my uncle and aunt love those dogs). So I bought her a gelato (cause the last time she came here, she loved it, as there's no place she can have those in her city) and we went to the bus station. I barely said a word to her during our way there, didn't really hug he goodbye and left cause her bus was already there. I cried the whole way back home. 
She message yesterday, saying that she knew I was angry but that it was just 'incomprehensible' and that she wouldn't say anything and we would talk when I wanted. She sent some voice memos about random stuff, but I didn't answer. She sent me a voice memo again today saying that if I can hold a grudge, so can she. She's also asking for my help with a loan she wants to make, cause those things are done online now and she doesn't know how to do it. I still didn't answer her.
I feel like is really petty of me but I felt really hurt when I asked for just one more day with her and she refused because of her dogs, when I'm the one always sacrificing possible fun vacations to go be with her and always stay longer when she asks.
Am I the asshole here?


UPTADE: She messaged me again today, saying that she asked me to  help her with the loan and that I ignored her. I took on what some of you said to me and sent her a long text explaining to that I'm really hurt and that I can't just talk to her as if nothing happened, that it felt shitty when I asked her to stay and she gave me that response and that I'm taking my meds and I'm fine but I just can't talk to her right now. 
She sent two voice memos, saying that I had every right to be upset but that I'm failing to see her side. That she didn't go back because of the dogs but because my uncle got injured and that she felt sad leaving me. But there's something she said that made me even more upset cause is something she always says when she wants me to cave in ""It's okay, I won't say anything"". Whenever we have a disagreement and she wants me to say that I'm wrong, she uses that phrase, it's like her way of saying ""do whatever you want"". She also said that I shouldn't expect any messages from her and that whenever I want to talk, I can cause she's not gonna stop being my mom and will always be here for me.
I haven't reply and don't think I will. I feel like the best thing right now is to put some space between us and focus on my recovery as I still have exams, medical appointments and another small surgery ahead.
I thank you all for the advices. Telling her everything didn't actually make me feel any better but it gave me a sense of what to do from here on.
I hope you all have a great day!

138,1c9yq9v,AITA For Telling My Dad That He's The Reason I've Been Stressed?,"I (15F) have had divorced parents since I was a baby, both my parents are petty and make it their goal in life to see each other suffer, with no regards to their children. I have an older sister (16F) who is rebelling specifically against my mom, because my sister is falling school, and sneaking out and my mom punishes her for it.

Earlier this week, my mom found my sister sneaking her phone from our dads house to our moms (which has been a rule since i was young and my mom is strictly against us bringing our dads phones)  and my mom took it, and my sister decided she would run away from home.

My sister was technically missing for 3 and a half days before my dad took her back to our moms. My dad did not tell me or my mom that he had my sister for 3 and a half days (he legally didn't have to but still). Me and my mom were worried. I first saw my sister while i was transitioning houses from my mom's to my dad's and i was in shock from seeing my sister who i thought could be hurt, or kidnapped, safe with my dad. When i was in the car with my dad, he was casually asking me about my week, like nothing happened. That immediately made me sick to hear. It felt like he was only trying to get to my mom, but he made me feel like i was only an attachment, like he didn't think of me as human. So i started talking about how bad my anxiety was and how i was shaking for almost 4 days straight in hopes to hint to my dad that i need a sincere apology.

He asked me why i was anxious,and if i was taking my meds. I kinda snapped, I told him that he was making my life harder by trying to get at my mom through me and my sister, and i told him that he was failing as a father. I said that i wish my mom took me and left him my sister and separated like they originally were going to. I don't feel bad because stuff like this has been going on my whole life. AITA?

140,1c9yi4y,AITA I refuse to go to my cousin’s baby shower,"I have a little cousin who I’ve been pretty close with our whole lives. She even lived with my parents and I while she was in college, so our bond is almost that of sisters. 

We haven’t spoke in almost two years. At that time she was in the beginning stages of a new relationship with this guy who she’d been on and off with since high school. He wasn’t always great to her and even admitted that he was embarrassed to be with her publicly due to her physical handicap. He cheated on her a lot and ended up with herpes. At one point, he didn’t even bother with the break up, just left the state and didn’t talk to her for a few years. For all of these reasons, I’m not this guy’s biggest fan, but my cousin seemed to be happy so I told her she should bring him to come hang out with me and my husband next time she’s in town. 

That was the last time we spoke outside of a “merry Christmas” “happy new year” or “happy birthday” text with no real conversation attached. I found out she married him when I saw all the pictures of their wedding on insta. I was hurt she didn’t even tell me she got engaged and that I wasn’t invited, but I assumed it was a low key affair and brushed it off and told her how beautiful she looked with no response from her.

 About 4-5 months ago, my sister told me that our cousin is pregnant, but she didn’t want too many people to know just yet so I had to pretend I didn’t know. I was again hurt that she wouldn’t tell me, but she’s an adult and given that her pregnancy would likely be a high risk one, I understand wanting to keep it private until it’s safe. 

About a month ago my mom asked my aunt (cousin’s mom) about it and was told my cousin specifically said she didn’t want my mom or I to know and asked her not to tell us. She said we’d never approved of her man and talked a lot of mess about him and she didn’t want our negativity to ruin this happy time in her life. This hurt in a big way. Sure I’d talked badly about him, but it was when I was agreeing with her all those times he’d hurt her.

I’ve never been anything but supportive towards her and I couldn’t believe she’d want to exclude me from her life like this. I managed to get over it and just unfollowed all of her socials so I didn’t need to see the life she didn’t want me to be a part of and moved on. 

A few days ago, she texted me and asked for my address so she can send a baby shower invitation, still not actually even telling me that’s married or pregnant, just that she’d like to send an invite. I told my mom about it who immediately said I should just forgive her and go. I’m absolutely not going. She’s clearly told people that doesn’t want me involved with this part of her life.

141,1c9yhn1,AITA for saying that I think my niece is autistic?,"Throw away account.
Let me start by saying I’m not an expert on autism, but I did take a couple of classes in college about working with special needs adults and children, and I have volunteered with special Olympics and YMCA for years.

I 28F have lived out of the country (US) for 2 years now. About a month before I left my niece was born. This is the first grandchild and the whole family was thrilled of course. I was in the delivery room and got to spend a month with her before I left.

I was gone for two years working before I got to come back to visit.

During my visit I got to spend 1 on 1 time with my niece. This is where I noticed some signs of autism. She’s over 2 yo and doesn’t try to speak, won’t make eye contact, won’t respond to her name, really doesn’t play with toys. More like she inspects them, or tries to figure them out.
Maybe I noticed because I don’t see her everyday.

I brought up to my bro and SIL that I think she might have autism and they need to talk to her dr. My brother took it pretty well (I think he might know deep down). But my SIL went off on me. Telling me my niece was perfect and is just developing on her own., that I didn’t have any right to say she had problems. Etc etc. My mom and dad stayed silent. My bro and SIL took my niece and left. My mom said I should have kept it to myself. My dad has always respected my education and experience and asked me why I thought so. I explained what I saw. He did some googling and now agrees with me. We both know early intervention is important for children with autism and only want what is best for her.

my SIL has now started a campaign in the family that I’m a jealous unmarried spinster, and am making up terrible things about my niece. My dad is taking up for me, my mom and brother are silent, and my SIL is on a rampage.

143,1c9y3rf,"AITA for giving one of my project partners an honest review, causing them to possibly flunk the class?","Hey all. I (23F) recently worked on a big group project for a biology class. The project was on an issue in the world, like Instagram tourism or POPs / PTEs. We had to sign up in a spreadsheet to a topic you thought sounded good enough. I ended up doing a project related to the Instagram tourism, since I found it most interesting. There were already two people signed up for it. Let’s call them Tim and Eric. They were pretty cool on doing all their work, and attended the meetings regularly. We got the ball rolling pretty early on, and we had no issues with anything.

  
Now, it was typically groups of four, but we were a group of three. There were about 32 kids in our class, so 8 projects in total, all 25 minutes in length, with an extra 5 minutes for a short Q&A section. According to our professor, the reason we were a person short is because one member of the class, let’s call him John, hadn’t been in class due to some lung issues. He had not been in since early February. However, unexpectedly, during the third week of our project, John reached out to Tim on Instagram. He asked to join in, which sort of shocked the rest of us and even the teacher.

  
Here’s where I might be in the wrong. John only met with us on the phone, claiming he was just at his apartment, sick. He did sound pretty terrible, I won’t lie. However, during one such phone call, one detail he made mention to was driving back from a show in a major city nearby. I’m no medical expert, but the fact he was out and about, hundreds of miles away, and not back in bed, just sort of stuck with me. On top of that, he didn’t submit his recorded audio files for our video presentation until last minute, forcing me to literally be arranging the video no less than one hour than the class was supposed to begin. And his audio was very “first take”, too. He also did not contribute to the slides he was reading off of- honestly, it felt more like he joined the project to save his grade.

  
I didn’t meet John in person until he showed up to presentation day. He didn’t answer any other questions, and honestly, if he hadn’t shown up, nothing would have changed. After the class had gotten done with reviews, the teacher asked us to fill out a group evaluation form. I gave Tim and Eric high marks and great comments because they actually DID something, but gave John a pretty scathing review because he didn’t do much, nor did he help on the project.

  
Today, John texted the group chat, complaining that his 67% had suddenly dropped to a MUCH lower grade because of the feedback review, saying that he might not pass this class again. As someone who’s had to repeat a class, I’d feel pretty annoyed if that happened.

And his audio was very “first take”, too. He also did not contribute to the slides he was reading off of- honestly, it felt more like he joined the project to save his grade.

  
I didn’t meet John in person until he showed up to presentation day. He didn’t answer any other questions, and honestly, if he hadn’t shown up, nothing would have changed. After the class had gotten done with reviews, the teacher asked us to fill out a group evaluation form. I gave Tim and Eric high marks and great comments because they actually DID something, but gave John a pretty scathing review because he didn’t do much, nor did he help on the project.

  
Today, John texted the group chat, complaining that his 67% had suddenly dropped to a MUCH lower grade because of the feedback review, saying that he might not pass this class again. As someone who’s had to repeat a class, I’d feel pretty annoyed if that happened. Am I the asshole for this?",0.0,0.09466243,0,1

Before leaving for the park, Greg and Stan started playing catch in our front yard with a hard baseball.  Unfortunately, one of Greg’s throws hit the tip of Stan’s mitt and bounced off into our front picture window, shattering the glass.  There were no adults in the front yard supervising the incident, but the boys agree that Greg threw the ball that hit the window, and that it was an accident (not malicious).  

I spoke with Greg’s grandma (who has custody of Greg) and expected her to pay for the broken window, but she believes that Greg is “at most, half responsible” because the boys were playing together in my yard.  So, Reddit, AITA?  Should I pay for the window?

Geez.  Point taken—I’ll pay for (at least half) of the window.  That said, I think the situation is far more nuanced than people are making it out to be.

146,1c9xdzc,WIBTA for not letting my friend stay at my place ,"I have a good friend in a different city who met a girl on a dating app. He really wants to come to my city to meet her, and hotels are generally quite expensive where I live. He asked if he could fly over and crash at my place and told me about the girl, and also said we could also hang out since he missed me. 

I don’t want him to stay for several reasons:
- I think him coming alone would make my boyfriend uncomfortable - I told him this and he already got a mutual female friend that is down to come too. 
- My parents are coming right before his planned dates and I just need time to reset after that. 
- I’ll be busy with school and exams during his planned dates, and I’ll need to catch up after my parents leave. 
- I don’t necessarily like the idea that he is being so pushy on staying at my place just to see a girl (it sorta feels like that’s his primary reason for coming instead of just to hang out and see an old friend, and because he’s so pushy about staying despite this time not being good for me, I feel a bit used - I did not tell him this, as I don’t know how to bring it up nicely). 

I already told him I couldn’t host at the time because of school being busy. I said I’d be happy for him and my other friend to come during the summer. However, it seems he is set on coming for those specific days because of the girl. 

Technically, I also COULD host them during those days. But it’s honestly not ideal for me for the reasons I said earlier (I like being alone and not having to worry about anyone around me while I study/have exams). But by not hosting, I’m probably setting him back hundreds of dollars in hotel expenses. 

Am I a bad friend or being selfish for feeling this way? I already told him most of the reasons for not being able to host those days, but he is sort of still pushing it.

147,1c9xc49,AITA For refusing to pick my daughter up and instead leaving her to get lectured by her dad?,"  
My daughter Kelly’s extracurricular was hosting an event that she wanted to volunteer for. The plan was that Kelly would stay for the full weekend to do the event, she would go on a bus to the building where the extracurricular is usually hosted, then I would pick her up from there since it’s only a 20 minute drive from home.  
  
It was over five hours of driving. It took three hours to get to there plus another two hours just to sit in traffic at the car line for the event. Traffic was not nearly as bad on the return trip, luckily. My younger daughter and I were having dinner an hour away from home, when I got a call from Kelly asking to come home.  
  
Nothing bad had happened. Kelly just said she didn’t like the things they were having her do (Carrying boxes/supplies, manning the check-in booth, etc.) She knew beforehand that she would be sleeping on a cot with a bunch of kids in the same area but claimed she didn’t realize what that was actually like until now and she wanted to go home.  
  
I told Kelly no, we were already hours away. Kelly started saying it wouldn’t be as bad as if we were already home, and that the traffic probably wouldn’t be as bad as it was earlier to get near the event. I again told Kelly no, and that, frankly, her asking this was extremely inconsiderate to us and our time. There was a convention that her sister wanted to go to but had to turn down because I had no one to take her and Kelly promised this event was important to her.  
  
Kelly kept begging me to pick her up. I told her no and suggested she ask her dad David if he’s willing to drive out and pick her up. Kelly eventually did end up calling David and claims that he lectured her for the entire two hours that he was driving them home. Kelly told her grandmother, who told me that Kelly’s actions were inconsiderate, but I know Kelly and David don’t get along right now. And I should have gone to get Kelly since I was closer than I would have been at home and a two hour lecture was just excessive on David’s end.  
  
I agree David’s lecture was excessive, but Kelly could also take it away as an important lesson that when you ask other people to accommodate you for a commitment and end up breaking said commitment, people are naturally going to be upset with you. Besides, it wasn’t as if Kelly was stranded in the middle of nowhere or in a bad situation. She was perfectly safe at the event. She could have either rode out the weekend or dealt with the lecture from David.   
  
I know a typical response in this situation is usually to say my mother shouldn’t have any input because she isn’t Kelly parent. But she does help with the girls and it wouldn’t be right to say she isn’t entitled to some input considering she has stepped up and gone out of her way as a grandparent to help in that regard. I’m looking for other perspective because I’m still unsure of whether I should consider my mother’s words or apologize to Kelly.

my teacher created a shared drive for everyone to create our files with our name on them and upload our work. today i got into my own file and discovered one of the subfiles was deleted. this isn't that big of a deal because it's already graded, but this isn't the first time a file disappears from the drive, i've had some classmates complaining about it since the semester started. now this is where i'm panicking because the teacher clearly stated that we had to inform this stuff immediately and if he found out who was deleting our files, he'd fail said person for the whole semester.

i think it's a little obvious right now, but when i informed my teacher about my missing files, my disabled classmate texted me on private apologizing, saying he didn't mean to delete my files and that it was an accident. i'm so nervous now because my teacher will either find out by himself or i'll have to tell him who did it. i don't want my classmate to fail the whole semester over a mistake, but idk how understanding of the situation my teacher would be.

149,1c9x65i,AITA for refusing to clean up after my housemates ,"I (24F) live with my Ex (25M) and his friend 'M' (24M). Last week Ex told me that M has decided to move out, he did not give me a reason but I have my suspicions as to why.
Ex and I were together for 4 years and broke up not long after we moved into our current rental with M. We decided to try and make it work and remain friends while I save up and find a rental for myself (which given the Australian rental market and cost of living could be a while). Ex had never been good at chores and I made it clear to both of them I would not be cleaning up after them because I am not their maid and that they would have to pull their weight when it comes to household chores. 
So far it's only me that does the cleaning of mutual areas such as the bathroom, toilet, and lounge room (which I barely use). I clean the kitchen when I use it (wiping benches and doing my own dishes that can't go in the dishwasher). 
My housemates on the other hand, will leave dishes in the sink instead of loading them into the dishwasher, leave rubbish on the kitchen island, beer cans and wine bottles on the coffee table, and fast food wrappers on the table on the deck which have blown into the backyard.
This apparently is all my responsibility to clean and they've told me multiple times that I need to start cleaning more. I told them it's their responsibility and that I won't do it.

150,1c9wzai,AITA for wanting my aging mother to stop bothering me with her problems?,"To preface- I come from a a very dysfunctional family. I grew up watching my alcoholic father get into (mostly verbal) altercations with my undiagnosed bipolar mother over her terrible spending habits. Eventually, my mother got fired from her job for having a manic episode at work- resulting in the eventual foreclosure of the family house. Not too long after that, when I was a teenager, our family dynamic fell apart when my father died. My mother spiraled into a mental break and was unable to provide for me. In the 15 years since then she has failed to hold gain, or hold, any meaningful employment. She is in her early 60s now and has not worked since she was 49. 

To be blunt- she's spent the past 20 years of her life or so not even trying to find work, planning for retirement, or taking care of herself in the slightest. She's overweight, incapable of walking more than ten or twenty minutes at a time, and would be completely destitute if not for my wife and I literally buying a house for her last year (it's in our name). She doesn't have any friends because she's burned every bridge she's had through just plain being mean and/or a giant emotional burden on anyone who gives her time of day. Every phonecall with her is just her complaining about her life, despite the fact she is completely materially taken care of- almost solely due to my efforts, mind you. 

As she ages, her ability to process the world has declined. Her memory is going. Her emotional control is pretty much completely gone. She's scared of it all, and has no one to talk to it about. She calls me constantly to complain about her husband (also a piece of work in his own right), her medical problems, her interactions with people, and anything else she can think of- and I'm fed up with it. 

I've tried my best to be a good son, but the honest truth is that I don't want to be burdened with her problems. She's made her bed by being lazy, unproductive, toxic, and shortsighted since I was a teenager. I have sympathy for her plights, but I can't help but just keep thinking that this lonely descent into an unsatisfying end of life is wholly her own fault. I can't fix someone who has spent nearly their entire life being a myopic sloth with a mood disorder.

I've recently taken a new approach of telling her that I am not her therapist nor her parent. I don't want to be her shoulder to cry on.

151,1c9wtkm,AITA if I take my daughter off the team,"My daughter is 10. This is her 3rd year playing softball. She is a great player and works her butt off. She plays any position asked, even though she has her preferences. 

Our community has an underwhelming little league softball following. So our 9u, 10u and 12u girls (ages 9-13) are playing on a team together. The coach is a local middle school teacher who asst coaches the softball team. I help assist, along with 2 other parents. 

His daughter is the pitcher. My daughter is taking pitching lessons and when I mentioned she wanting to try pitching he said “there’s no way she’ll be ready to pitch this season. It took my daughter a full two seasons before she got on the mound”. We felt this was a little unfair because lots of rec teams have new pitchers, no one is expecting perfection. (And his daughter is frequently walking players). Today he told another girl who hasn’t been pitching she could try it if it’s ok with her dad (dad is coach’s friend)

So we shrugged it off. 

He asked my daughter to play catcher. She got into it and looked forward to it.  So she was catcher for all the practices up to the first game.  First game comes and he tells the team that a girl who hasn’t even been going to practice (but is a middle schooler and his daughter’s friend) .. will be the catcher. Never lets my daughter touch the gear again. 

Again. My daughter took it and kept her chin up and didn’t complain. 

Today at practice, we both didn’t feel well. In retrospect, we should have just stayed home… but the coach insisted everyone show up because it’s our last practice before 3 upcoming games. My daughter (just turned 10) struggled with her batting today and the catcher (age 13) told her “how many fouls balls are you going to hit”. My daughter was already feeling embarrassed by her performance, in addition to us dealing with our sinus gunk, and got really upset with this. 

I approached the coach and told him they didn’t need to be shit-talking. And he replies, “it’s not shit talking. It’s a question”. To which I replied “it sure felt like shit talking”. And he said “it’s not”. I told him we weren’t feeling well and we were going home, I turned around and my daughter thanked me. And we left without another word. 

My daughter doesn’t want to play for the team anymore. She feels like the older girls/middle schoolers are being favorited… and I can’t really disagree with her. 

She’s also playing for a travel team where she feels appreciated and heard. She’s feeling like the older girls get preference. 

AITA for taking her off the rec team after this? Normally we would tough it out and use it as an experience to prove ourselves. (She is one of 4 girls on the team with actual experience). It will definitely hurt the field performance of the team and reduce the player number, which they’re already struggling to fill. 
My kid feels undervalued and struggling to find joy in it anymore. 

ETA: thank you all so much for the comments. I obviously want to protect my kid and make sure she knows her worth.. but hate our decision will disadvantage the good parts of the team. She and I have been talking a lot about it tonight I’m going to support her 100% if she decides to quit. I’m letting her take the lead and make the decision.. and we will leave our guilt of the things we cannot control behind us.

Today at practice, we both didn’t feel well. In retrospect, we should have just stayed home… but the coach insisted everyone show up because it’s our last practice before 3 upcoming games. My daughter (just turned 10) struggled with her batting today and the catcher (age 13) told her “how many fouls balls are you going to hit”. My daughter was already feeling embarrassed by her performance, in addition to us dealing with our sinus gunk, and got really upset with this. 

I approached the coach and told him they didn’t need to be shit-talking. And he replies, “it’s not shit talking. It’s a question”. To which I replied “it sure felt like shit talking”. And he said “it’s not”. I told him we weren’t feeling well and we were going home, I turned around and my daughter thanked me. And we left without another word. 

My daughter doesn’t want to play for the team anymore. She feels like the older girls/middle schoolers are being favorited… and I can’t really disagree with her. 

She’s also playing for a travel team where she feels appreciated and heard. She’s feeling like the older girls get preference. 

AITA for taking her off the rec team after this? Normally we would tough it out and use it as an experience to prove ourselves. (She is one of 4 girls on the team with actual experience). It will definitely hurt the field performance of the team and reduce the player number, which they’re already struggling to fill. 
My kid feels undervalued and struggling to find joy in it anymore. 

ETA: thank you all so much for the comments. I obviously want to protect my kid and make sure she knows her worth.. but hate our decision will disadvantage the good parts of the team. She and I have been talking a lot about it tonight I’m going to support her 100% if she decides to quit. I’m letting her take the lead and make the decision.. and we will leave our guilt of the things we cannot control behind us. ",0.0,1.0041238,1,0
152,1c9wrte,AITA after telling my friend that she’s not someone I can trust anymore?,"I (20f) and Lucky (18f) have been friends for almost a year now and we both struggle with mental health issues that are really bar at times but we’ve always been there for each other no matter what because we know how it feels to not have anyone or to not have the type of support you need. One day my impulsive tendencies got the best of me and I OD ended up in the hospital and was in so much pain. Lucky saw the videos I’d posted on my mental health story where I posted about my struggle and she got triggered which is absolutely valid and understandable she sent me a long text saying she couldn’t see me going through all this and needed a break. Which I said that that was understandable and I hope she is okey, she removed me from snap which really hurt because I was not expecting that. 1 or 2 days later she texted me on the phone about getting a job but she still hadn’t added me back on snap and it really upset me and I felt like if I ever got in a situation like that again she’d leave and I wasn’t going to cont on her to be there for me and help me through a hard time anymore. So when she added me back on snap after a week she asked if I was mad and I said that I wasn’t because I wasn’t just hurt. Literally in that week I say in a group chat that she’s in that I’m not doing good at all and I just wanted to let everyone know that I love them and how much I appreciate them then I was naming everyone in the group and what I loved about them the most when it comes to how they help me and make me feel lucky got upset that everyone except her had something to do with that I can talk to them about absolutely everything and count on them to be there for me and she only got the I love her and that I look at her as my cousin and she makes me feel less crazy in this world I said well I can’t trust her to be there for me if I am going through some hard thing. She got really mad at me and said some really mean things about me including that am an absolute asshole and that she got really fucked up from that and I have not talked to her since then so AITA for telling my friend that she’s not someone I can trust?",Asshole,2024-04-22,"AITA after telling my friend that she’s not someone I can trust anymore?
