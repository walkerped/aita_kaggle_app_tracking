0,1cbawvs,"AITA for setting boundaries with friends and standing up for myself?
","About 2 years ago I was coming to terms with being trans (27MTNB) and got super sick at the same time, so I took a hiatus from my friend group to deal with that. I didn't want to affect other people with my anxiety and I could tell that I wasn't handling the stress very well. I took about a 9 month break, and a few friends reached out to me, since we're all pretty close-knit and have been since we were kids.

‚Ä¢  Will - I've known him since we were about 2. My oldest friend and I've shared so many good and bad times with him. Confused but trying to be supportive about me being trans.

‚Ä¢ Vince - Old best friend, known since about 5. Used to be as close with him as I used to be with Will, if not closer. Started to become borderline white supremacist a few years ago. Used to be a good person, but there was some sort of shift in him and he became bitter. Transphobic.

‚Ä¢ Steve - Vince's new best friend. Has BPD but generally a good guy, and  decently trans positive, but he tends to do things for shock value. 

‚Ä¢ Gina - Only girl of the group. Bisexual, trans positive. Tries to keep some of the more nasty comments in check. (Racism, sexism, etc.) 

To start to re-intigrate, I joined back up with some of the group chats after coming out to Will, Steve, and Gina since I trusted them the most about having my back. I knew Vince would probably be hateful since he's said stuff in the past like ""If it were my choice I wouldn't give trans people their medication"" (Paraphrased, he's a pharmacist). Overall went pretty well coming back to the Facebook chat, no issues.

Then I tried to reintegrate with playing games with them on Discord. We have a server for just our close friends but it's not being used really anymore in favor of a more open server owned by Will and moderated by Vince and Steve. I joined that on the condition of I would leave if I encountered any transphobia, since it had some random people they like to play Destiny 2 with in it as well.

I was joking around and someone called me bro (which honestly, I don't have any issue with Will or other certain people calling me that, it was more so the issue that it was one of the people I wasn't comfortable with).

 I asked them to not call me that, and it ended up devolving into them saying:

‚Ä¢ I wasn't ""normal"" for putting my pronouns in my name

‚Ä¢ said he wouldn't ""cater to sissy mindset"" etc.

Vince's reaction as a mod was ""Reading the drama üçø"" which I should have expected, I don't really to expect them to understand me being trans since it's so new to them, but a lot of them said they expected and sort of knew. I just wanted to be treated with basic respect and not called slurs. So I left the server and just cut myself off again, since I figured they aren't people who would support me through this process.  I set the boundary that I would leave if people were transphobic, Will knew that boundary and didn't stick up for me, and neither did anyone else. Am I expecting too much or AITA?

1,1cavk41,AITA for not calling the lady that hit my car back?,"For context, I am a new driver. I just got my junior operator‚Äôs license last week and I started driving to school, driving with my sister to get ice cream, shopping, etc. April break came a few days later and my parents took themselves, my siblings, and a few of their friends on vacation. I opted out as I had gone on college tours over winter break and I really wanted to spend a week at home studying for upcoming AP exams. 

One day, I was coming home from a store and heading to get some lunch when I approached a crosswalk. There was a man walking by who looked like he wasn‚Äôt going to enter the crosswalk. Then, at the last moment, he ran into the road and I had to slam on my brakes. I would‚Äôve killed him if I hadn‚Äôt. When I thought all was well and I was safe to go, I felt a car come crashing into the rear end of my car and I jerked forward.

I am a very cautious driver. I don‚Äôt speed, I buckle up, I do everything that‚Äôs required of me to be safe while driving. I was only going 32 mph in a 30 mph zone. Clearly, the driver behind me had to have been riding my ass for her to hit me. And she was.

We pulled into a parking lot and the lady asked me if I was okay. This lady had to have been in her 60‚Äôs. She was driving a white Mercedes-Benz. Immediately, she accused me of going way too fast and criticized my driving. I was astonished and almost was brought to tears. I had no idea what to do in this situation as I am a brand new driver and never would‚Äôve expected anything like this to happen during my second week of driving with my license.

I only had a few scratches on my bumper (thank the Lord!) and the hood of her car was curved in a bit to the point where she couldn‚Äôt pop it open. She insisted that she take pictures of the damage and a picture of my license, to which I told her that I didn‚Äôt have an official license card yet, just a permit paper with the indication that I passed the driving exam at the bottom of the permit. She had a field day with this.

After the screaming, she told me that she would let this ‚Äúslide under the radar‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know it then because I believed that somehow I was in the wrong, but she was trying to make an insurance claim for this whole situation-something she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do successfully since SHE hit ME. So we parted ways after we exchanged numbers and she said she would call me to update me.

I told my parents and they said I absolutely shouldn‚Äôt contact her. They told me that she must‚Äôve wanted to make an insurance claim for this accident so that she wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the damage out-of-pocket. They also told me if I contact her, I could accidentally give permission for her to do things that would get me in trouble (not entirely sure what though.) She left me a voicemail saying she wanted to touch base with me and I haven‚Äôt responded at all.

2,1cava3x,WIBTA if I didn't tell someone their friend is a predator so I can protect my family? ,"Last July my daughter (Anna) turned 16.  Her dad and I, along with her 18 year old sister (Beth) went to dinner to celebrate.   Following dinner,  they wanted to go shopping.   Beth drove them to the store and my husband and I went home. 

While they were there,  we get a FaceTime call from them stating that a man is watching them and following them around the store.   Before they could get to security,  the man exposed himself and was touching himself.   They got safely to security and the police were called.  Despite being able to see him on camera,  the outdoor footage did not clearly show his license plate when he fled. 

A couple months later I get a call from the police.   He has done it again and this time,  they got his license plate,  they connected the two cases and he was arrested. 

We went to district court in early this year.  He was there with his wife who was wearing a t-shirt that said ""sorry,  not sorry"".  They have 5 young children together.   He was sentenced to 6 months.  He appealed and was released 3 weeks later.   He chose a jury trial in circuit court and that case is pending. 

My problem is that when I learned his name,  I researched him online.   He has previous charges for the same thing in 2018 and 2020.  I also looked him up on social media and found that we have a mutual friend,  Cara.   I became social media friends with Cara through a good friend, Delaney. Cara is really more of an acquaintance.  However,  we live close by to each other and her daughter plays on the same high school sports team as my daughter,  so I see her frequently. 

I feel torn regarding telling Cara.  I don't know her that well and I cannot tell online how good of friends she is with the predator and his wife (she's friends with both of them).  I'm worried if I tell Cara,  she may tell them who I am/where I live etc.   His behavior seems to be escalating and I'm concerned he could retaliate. I'm also worried that her children could be in danger if she's allowing them around this man.   Cara has 3 children,  her oldest being 16.

7,1caun0i,AITA for talking to a stranger's child?,"Hello Reddit, first time poster here. I (26M) was visiting a Go-Kart track in my city for the first time and took advantage of a holiday discount offer. While it was in no way cheap, it was still more affordable than regular pricing. In turn, it meant that there would be more customers.
The process to get racing goes like this: you get in line, get let in and take your kart and can start once the employee gives the group the go ahead. Then you drive for around 10-15minutes until you are to drive back in the pitlane and a new group of racers can take their turn rinse and repeat.

With all this backstory, now to the incident in question.
During my second run, i got stuck behind the child (Maybe 9-10years old?) in question. I couldn't overtake him given that he tried to use racing lines but also veered off, blocking the chance to overtake without crashing into him in the short track with many twist and turns. At the 2nd lap of being stuck behind him, he got the blue flag, the signal that someone faster is behind him and that he should slow down and pull to the side to let them pass.

He did not do that. So instead i got stuck for around 3-1/2laps behind him until the race was over and we had all had to get back into the pitlane. There I approched the kid and told him ""Hey kiddo. Just a reminder, if he (the employee) swings the blue flag, it means someone faster is behind you and you're meant to let them pass.""
Afterwards i waited in the lobby for the current round to pass to join the next and last one again.

Now, as I chatted with other people at the bar (non alcoholic) the kids father approched me, looking ready to fight and asked me what my problem was for me to talk to his son like that.
I really didn't understand cause i saw nothing wrong and told him as such, leading to him to explain that now, the child who was until then having a great time, was now feeling sad and defeated. After leaving, the other people who also took part in that race didn't understand the problem either.

As i wanted to join for the next round, the employee stopped me, telling me that it wasn't my place to reprimand other people, let alone children on the rules and that continued behaviour would get me banned.

I really didn't understand cause i saw nothing wrong and told him as such, leading to him to explain that now, the child who was until then having a great time, was now feeling sad and defeated. After leaving, the other people who also took part in that race didn't understand the problem either.

As i wanted to join for the next round, the employee stopped me, telling me that it wasn't my place to reprimand other people, let alone children on the rules and that continued behaviour would get me banned.

He does this often tho but he usually tells me bye when I'm next to him. When we started driving off my brother asked me who friend was and I just told him that that was friend. He then started questioning me more asking me why I never talked about him and stuff and then had the audacity to call me friendless (not true)? After a while I guess he got aggravated with me calling him friend and asked me what his 'real name' was. 

I told him that I honestly did not know and friend just started talking to me randomly one day. He got upset with me for not knowing his name and asked me how I didn't know. I told him that it was because he knew my name which was weird. I told him that I didn't want to ask him his name because that would just be embarrassing which is why I started calling him friend as a nickname and friend doesn't mind so he shouldn't either. 

He asked me if friend knew I didn't know his name and I said that I wasn't sure, prolly not and then he just got madder.

 I told him that I would have done the same thing but the difference was he didn't introduce him self or anything he just started talking to me like he knew me personally and that's why I never asked him.

Kevin's hobby is restoring old motorcycles, so he was showing me his latest project out in the garage. Even though I'm not a gearhead myself, Kevin and I have known each other for 20 years, and I can still admire good workmanship when I see it. 

Anyway, when we were almost done, Kevin's new girlfriend (we'll call her Taylor) came out to the garage with all sorts of attitude. It was obvious that she had just gotten home from work, since she was in office attire, and I tried saying hi to her, but she kind of blew me off and walked back inside. Apparently, Kevin was supposed to have started dinner but didn't because he was talking to me. I decided to stop Kevin in the garage for a moment so that we could have a man-to-man discussion. I told him that his ex-girlfriend (we'll call her Kerry) would never have treated us this way and asked what he saw in Taylor. 

Kevin seemed annoyed and insisted that he and Taylor are happy and that she's ""better for him anyway."" Kerry was a bartender and was a lot of fun, but Kevin said that she was ""too immature"" and ""not someone he could settle down with."" I was stunned by Kevin's lack of self-awareness. Here he was, having dated so many women that he could be choosy, while I was here single for the last three years. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for Kevin, but the man doesn't know how lucky he is. I suggested a compromise and said that if he's so good at getting women to date him, he should dump Taylor for being a bitch and find someone who's both mature and kind. 

Kevin gave me a scowl for a few seconds and said ""I think it's time for you to go."" Kevin had never been so blunt or so rude with me, and I think I hurt his feelings bad. I got in my car and left, but all of my text messages since getting home have gone unanswered. I told my roommate what happened, and he insisted that I was in the wrong. He also said that I should apologize to Kevin for what I said. I think it's such BS that I can't even go over to my friend's place and talk to him without his nasty girlfriend basically blaming me for being hungry.

15,1catngq,AITA for denying my boyfriend unlimited access to my vape? ,"This is really embarrassing but here we go. I‚Äôm 27F, he is 31M. 

My boyfriend and I live together. I pay rent, half of the bills, and he owns the home and pays a higher percentage of the mortgage payment. I also buy groceries for both of us. We both vape nicotine - yes I know, it‚Äôs a terrible habit that I am trying to quit but for now, the issue:
whenever I tell my boyfriend that I‚Äôd rather he didn‚Äôt hit my vape so much, it becomes a huge fight and he begins berating my character because he thinks I should share everything with him unconditionally. I don‚Äôt think this is fair, as I share literally every other thing without question, and I think when I use something of someone‚Äôs I either offer to buy them more or simply don‚Äôt ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù or their kindness and abuse the situation. For example if I use a lot of his face wash, I‚Äôll buy a new one and we both use that one until it‚Äôs finished. 

Side note: I don‚Äôt think everything in a relationship needs to be tit for tat by any means, I am only saying this because he made me feel as though I don‚Äôt contribute enough and should just let him hit the vape whenever he wants to.

He purchased dokha (tobacco) to smoke out of a pipe instead so that he would only hit it at home rather than having a constant source of nic nearby. When I started buying disposables again, he began hitting mine while we were at home or out/ in the car together. 

I didn‚Äôt mind sharing at first, but I began to get annoyed because he never purchased himself a vape ever again (he also has a reusable that he could buy juice for but anyway). It‚Äôs been about 6 months that he will consider my vapes, *our* vapes essentially, and I‚Äôve asked him why he doesn‚Äôt just repurchase juice or one for himself. His response: he doesn‚Äôt want to do that. On two occasions he‚Äôs offered to give me a few dollars to hit it unconditionally but I said no. 

I really just want to feel that if I say no, it can be respected. Things got out of hand tonight when this all came up again, and after I‚Äôd said no he asked me if this is really the kind of person I am, and  that he could find someone he ‚Äúoperates better with‚Äù and basically asked me to leave tonight. I tried to stay calm because this has happened before and I figured he was just angry and would apologize later. I asked if this is really how he felt and he said yes and that he needed to think about things. 

I waited a bit and then called him while he was out and asked if he was serious about me moving out etc but he doubled down saying that he doesn‚Äôt have this much friction with anyone else in his life and thinks this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue with someone else. This hurt. We‚Äôve been together for almost 7 years. 

Now I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I should just share with him unconditionally. Am I the asshole for not letting him use my vape whenever he wants to? He says he pays more for the house, which is true.

",Not the A-hole,2024-04-23,"AITA for denying my boyfriend unlimited access to my vape?  This is really embarrassing but here we go. I‚Äôm 27F, he is 31M. 

My boyfriend and I live together. I pay rent, half of the bills, and he owns the home and pays a higher percentage of the mortgage payment. I also buy groceries for both of us. We both vape nicotine - yes I know, it‚Äôs a terrible habit that I am trying to quit but for now, the issue:
whenever I tell my boyfriend that I‚Äôd rather he didn‚Äôt hit my vape so much, it becomes a huge fight and he begins berating my character because he thinks I should share everything with him unconditionally. I don‚Äôt think this is fair, as I share literally every other thing without question, and I think when I use something of someone‚Äôs I either offer to buy them more or simply don‚Äôt ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù or their kindness and abuse the situation. For example if I use a lot of his face wash, I‚Äôll buy a new one and we both use that one until it‚Äôs finished.

I was 15 at the time, Friend A was 16, Friend B had just turned 17. Friend B was moving away after the end of the school year, so we were trying to spend as much time with her as we could. Friend A however was working 2 jobs, on top of an AP art class and going into her senior year. We [ Me and Friend B ] tried to be supportive of her busy schedule and understood that even when she had time to hang out, she was exhausted. 

It seemed however, Friend A didn‚Äôt mind hanging out with her boyfriend at any time of the day or missing events or etc instead of friend B and me. 

Friend A‚Äôs boyfriend was also a total douche. He wasn‚Äôt just rude or disrespectful, some of his political beliefs were ridiculous ( he was a Neo-Nazi for example [ CRAZY IK ] ) and was very heavily into his beliefs. For a while we thought it was just a joke, regardless if it was inappropriate, we figured he just had a very fucked sense of humor. Not only that, he seemed to actively hate friend B and me, making snarky comments, being rude and disrespectful for absolutely no reason, shitting on our names, and almost manipulating friend A into hating us. 

The finally breaking point was when he continued to make comments on Friend B‚Äôs ethnic food saying it smelled disgusting, looked atrocious, etc. This made Friend B pretty uncomfortable and she started to not eat because of it and sit in the library. after a while, i went to sit with her and we discussed his behavior and how it made us both uncomfortable.

He made excuses that he was Schizophrenic and his mood shifted a lot

Friend A got really mad at us, saying he was joking around, and regardless it still made us uncomfortable that he would make those jokes. [ for example about the jokes, they would be racist, sexist, he would make fun of special ed kids in his class and gossip about them ] [ he also claimed he could make racist jokes because he was black ]. we started arguing and it led to us cutting contact completely.

fast forward 5 months, i reached out to friend A. friend B had already moved and i was keeping contact with her the best I could and still am. friend a seemed to be okay with becoming friends again only to text me basically saying she felt she would be disrespecting herself by letting me back into her life. needless to say, i was furious and didnt attempt to reach out anymore.

19,1catbfl,AITA for saying I don't want my aunt in my car? ," A bit of backstory, my (f21) aunt (fLate40s) has done a LOT of awful things. My family always excused it because she had a bad childhood. She has no relationship with her kids as she didn't even raise them for the majority of their lives. When I was 17-18 she would take me out to eat to 'spend time with her niece' but every time she would dump all of her problems on me. She was a bad influence and tried to get me try smoking stuff behind my parents back as soon as I was 18 (I said no). She had my sister (F16) try a sip of her drink without asking my parents.
 My uncle (not blood related, uncle through love) and her used to date. Those times she took me out to eat was with his money as he is decently wealthy and she used that a lot. Their relationship was very off and on again (by her choice). He always took her back no matter what. We told him many times that she was using him but he didn't listen as he loved her. 
 There was a time where he asked her to marry him and she said no because she was seeing a married man. That man left his his wife and kid to marry her and they divorced a month later. My uncle still took her back.
 A few months ago, about Januany or Febuary, she had come to visit and my uncle was with her. She rode to Sunday night church in my car with me and my sister since my parents car was full. At the time I still had a decent relationship with her but we weren't close. On the drive back home she told me and my sister that she was planning to leave my uncle in March as she didn't love him. When we got home there was a moment she sat on his lap for a minute and kissed him before walking off. I was pissed but she asked me not to tell him. I was being forced to choose him or her and didn't know what to do. I wish I had told him.
 She was living in my uncle's home and he caught her using some harder stuff again. He kicked her out but she refused to leave. It took at least a week to get her to leave and she stole his tvs.
 A month ago it came out that my adult male cousin (her son) was doing bad things to my 7 year old female cousin. She defended him and and helped him run from the cops since she believed that he didn't do it. As soon as I was told this I went no contact with her.
 A few days ago she called my dad (she has used my parents many times but my dad is a pushover) and I heard him say something about a car. My parents were borrowing my car while theirs were in the shop. I told my mom I don't want her in my car. She claimed that I was being spiteful because I was mad but I don't think so.

Even though we were teenagers, my brother being an adult, we still aren't allowed to curse in front of our family, due to a rule they set when we were 11 and 13 years old. 

Even though I was sick of it, all the insults and chasing, I still think I could be the a-hole. He never used curses in the insults and said he meant it in a playful manner. He seemed really hurt by it, and I could tell because he went silent. but I didn't care in the moment. I was sick of it. However, that's up for judgement.",0.0,-0.007758313,0,1
23,1casf8y,AITA: Wearing the same color Prom dress as my friend,"Hey guys! I‚Äôve never posted on Reddit and I am hoping I do this correctly! Here‚Äôs my dilemma: So I am a 18F going to Prom with 17M and our friend group 18F, 18F and 18M. So there are 3 girls, two boys. Backstory is that I met a guy (17F) and this friend group at a church event and became super close with them. I am currently going to a school in which I am the only senior (small sports academy with <100 students). I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have the chance to probably go to Prom and I was so heartbroken. But, the 17M I am going with now promposed to me about two to three weeks ago. Although extremely excited and grateful for the opportunity to go, now the hunt for a prom dress started and the real issues begin. 

One of the 18F in our group demands that we all are wearing different colors about a week ago. I at first was okay with this as I thought there would probably be no clash with colors until I learned the same girl had bought a purple dress (which I was looking for too). I was at first upset but looked for another color to avoid any drama. But after looking for weeks with a smaller budget (200-300 dollars) and a bad selection, I thought I was at a loss until I found a dress today. It‚Äôs a purple dress (not the same shade or style but it‚Äôs purple). I loved it on me and I felt so beautiful. I felt like a princess. 

I texted 18F asking if this was okay since the dresses were drastically pretty differently style wise and shade wise but still purple. After that text ensued a huge argument in which I am told ‚Äúthis has happened to me before‚Äù (a prior event where her BFF at the time wore the same EXACT dress to HOCO) and ‚Äúwe are going to clash‚Äù.  I offered to not be in any group photos after she says ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt care but she won‚Äôt do a group photo because it will make use blend together‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt helpful. 

I ended up buying the dress because I feel like I am being walked all over but maybe I am wrong? I feel so sick to my stomach right now and feel regret for buying the dress I really love. AITA?

26,1carx3d,AITA for calling people out on fouls while playing pickup basketball? ,"Note: knowing the general rules of basketball might help understand this better but not required. 

Last night at my adult 30+ basketball league that I‚Äôve been attending weekly for almost a year with no verbal altercation issues, I got into it with a couple of new guys that showed up. I have never seen them before and they both didn‚Äôt understand the rules of the game. Guy A, kept setting moving screens like an offensive lineman. I called him out on it and he admitted he didn‚Äôt know the rules so I explained it to him. Then the next possession when I was on offense, I was cutting to the hoop and guy B was holding my arm as I was driving. I called my own foul and the guy threw his hands up and was complaining I called the foul. I explained the rules and he rolled his eyes and said I was complaining too much about that and about calling guy A about the moving screens.

These are the basic rules of basketball and they were both upset about my ‚Äúcomplaints‚Äù. Everyone else that was playing were regulars and guy A was called out by 2 other people for moving screens to which he responded negatively. Me calling them both out was definitely the loudest and most verbal altercation of the night but I was fed up with these two guys showing up who clearly didn‚Äôt know how to play and made it seem like I was the bad guy. Everyone else just watched and none of the regulars stood up for me which was annoying but I get that a lot of people don‚Äôt like to insert themselves into things. 

So I‚Äôm feeling like I did something wrong with the way they reacted but I know I‚Äôm in the right with how the game should be played. My approach can sometimes come off brash when I call people out but that‚Äôs par for the course with pickup and emotions/adrenaline. 

I know I should just let it go but felt like typing this out and seeking other perspectives to see if my feelings are justified or if I could have handled it differently. I‚Äôm an emotional/sensitive guy so this is affecting me a little more than it should. 

TLDR: 
Last night at my regular adult basketball league, I had a verbal altercation with two new players over rules. One player set illegal screens and the other fouled me but complained when I called it. Despite explaining the rules, they disagreed, leading to a heated exchange. The regular players didn't intervene, which bothered me. I feel conflicted about the situation and wonder if I could've handled it better. My emotional reaction is affecting me more than it should. Seeking perspectives on whether my feelings are justified or if I should have approached it differently.

27,1carqbt,WIBTA For Skipping Mother's Day With MIL This Year?,"My (34 F) Husband (41 M) and I are about to have our second child, and I've had a horrible pregnancy. It turns out I have a complication where I'll need to be induced early, about 2 days before mother's day this year. Because I've had such an awful time with this pregnancy, I really don't want visitors at the hospital, or at home for the first couple weeks. 

The problem is every year mother's day is a huge ordeal. My husband and his mom (69 F) don't really get along, so he rarely wants to go to her house for mother's day (though we always get pressured into it anyway).  I lost my own mom as a teenager so mother's day is always hard for me, but when I've expressed that to my MIL her response is usually along the lines of ""but it's my day too"". She and I do not have a bad relationship like 90% of the time, so when I had my first child she did make an effort to celebrate me too. I just still don't enjoy mother's day, and don't like celebrating it because it reminds me too much of my mom. 

The major complication this year is that my husband's younger brother died late last year, so this will be my MIL's first mother's day without him here. My husband and I both hate the idea of her being sad on mother's day, but I genuinely cannot handle being around anyone 2 days after I give birth following a pretty traumatic pregnancy (almost especially because I've had to go through this without my own mom).

I'm dreading the conversation with MIL because I know it won't go well. My husband has no issue having the conversation with her, but she often doesn't respect him or his boundaries, so sometimes things have to come from me for her to take it seriously.

I reached out, apologized, and offered them their choice of ANY of my other animals that I had for sale. I also told them that I would be getting a few more animals very similar to the one they'd wanted. For a while, they continued to talk to me as if they weren't too upset.

I was pretty horrified. I said to her that it seemed like an awful way to make a kid stop biting people.

I feel bad because I feel like i‚Äôve really messed up, but all my friends are telling me it‚Äôs not a big deal and that she needs to get over it, especially because i don‚Äôt even like him. What do y‚Äôall think?

Long story short, Marcus and Courtney broke up a week or two ago because Courtney started dating one of my daughter's male friends, who were supposedly ""Barely acquainted"" before they started dating. When my son found out, he started to actively avoid Mias everywhere because he believes my daughter set them up together while he was dating his gf, even though my daughter swears she didn't intervene or was involved in anything.

Up until now, they've still been being pretty hostile to each other, and as any parent, I don't like seeing my kids fight, so I've been considering taking them both out for activities they would have to do together, or be within a 5 meter radius of each other. My husband (who's also trying to solve the issue, but taking and addressing both sides) says ""it won't work"" because it will just pull them apart.

33,1caqsbc,WIBTA for asking children to stop soliciting cars to honk for them?,"I'm somewhat sleep deprived, so I defer to Reddit's judgement.

I (37F) live in a residential neighborhood with a fair amount of kids. My house is only 3 down from an elementary school and playground. 

For the last week or so, a small group of children (5-8 kids, my guess on ages is 7-12) have been congregating on the sidewalk corner of the cul-de-sac directly across from my house. While there they encourage every vehicle that passes to honk for them. They do so by yelling ""honk"", making the truck honk gesture, and most recently by holding up signs.

This first happened on a Friday evening and there were 5 kids. The street I live on is the main one in the neighborhood and connects to 2 major roads in town, so it gets a lot of traffic. By my unofficial estimate they were able to get 2/3 to honk. I want to point out that these children are not running a lemonade stand, aren't selling anything, aren't promoting anything, aren't affiliated with any group/cause. They just like getting cars to honk.

The first time, I was annoyed. Mostly because I work swing shifts, including 3rds, so I was trying to sleep when they did it. Also because I have a 1.5 y/o dog that I'm still trying to train (specifically on barking, he's trained on most other things). Not only does he start barking but he also just seems confused and anxious with the frequent honking. While I was annoyed, I had zero thought to say anything or try to stop the kids, as I figured it was a 1 off situation and they were just being kids.

However, since then they have continued this activity. They also scream and shriek at loud volumes, and other children have now joined the original group. The cars have gotten so used to it that they almost always honk, some doing an extended lay on the horn honk. The kids usually start around 4pm on school days and will stay anywhere from 2 hours to until it gets dark which isn't until like 9pm. (It's not constant, they go in for a bit for dinner, and sometimes they get caught up in playing some other game, but 8/10 past days they've been soliciting honks for 1-2 hours at the very least.

I use earplugs when trying to sleep during the day but car horns, especially since they are honking right in front of my house, still come through. I'm missing sleep. My dog has regressed with their anxiety. Part of my job is providing care to people and with how foggy my brain has been due to lack of sleep, I'm worried I may make a mistake that could be harmful to my clients.

I'm working close to 50 hour weeks and averaging 4 hours of sleep a day right now.

WIBTA if I approached the kids and asked them to please stop requesting cars honk for them? I would try to be as polite as possible and explain how/why it's impacting me. I get that this is such an innocent thing for children to do and I feel like a grumpy old lady trying to police their fun, however, it also feels excessive and is seriously messing with my well being and my dog.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-23,"WIBTA for asking children to stop soliciting cars to honk for them?

This evening I started feeling bitter and resentful  because I am missing him and suggested that it's his fault, he put the 3 years on us, not his mentor as the mentor doesn't even know he's planning on moving here in 6 months so there's nothing stopping him from moving sooner. He's mad because I made him feel like an AH, but he understands where I'm coming from, he misses me too.
He points out that I've told him in the past his loyalty and work ethic is one of the things I found attractive and always supported. Well 2.5 years in I'm missing him, I feel alone and isn't it him making us wait?

I'm self employed so when I visit him it's about $1000 between flights, paying someone to watch my dog, cover my shifts and turning away work (I also have a side gig on weekends) for a few days with him and he has told me until he's making more at his job he can't come here as often.

firstly, I would say that I really did take into consideration a lot of the comments that said I've been punished by the family enough. Evan has the right to still be mad but after this length of time I think it's time the rest of my family start treating me as an equal member again.

I did fly home for the wedding. the friend who I was on vacation with was very agreeable to me going. I know the judgement was that I would not be TA for skipping, but I was just too scared to lose Justin too. Yes, I wanted to have the conversation about him treating me equally now, but to do that I first needed him to be speaking with me.

Unexpectedly, Justin actually picked me up from the airport. he was immediately apologetic for how he talked to me and the position he put me in in forcing me to fly home, and recognized it wasn't right or fair. he even offered to pay the cost of my tickets. I accepted his apology, but told him we could talk about it more later, it was his wedding day and the focus should be on him and that.

we drove to the hotel where he and my parents and the other groomsmen, including Evan where you staying. Evan came to my room shortly after I checked in. It wasn't a happy movie scene where we hugged and all was forgiven, it was really awkward, two people on eggshells. we just sorta agreed to have a good day for Justin, and talk at some later point. in the end I am glad I went to the wedding, as unfair as Justin asking was, it was pretty clear that having both me and Evan there that day meant a lot to him. I flew back out the next day to meet my friend.

since I've been back Evan and I have been talking and have met up. I've apologized again, but also he has forcing me out. he was (understandably) mad at me, and said he just could never seem to move past being mad, and it became easier to stay mad. but he missed me, he's wanted to call and then backed off doing so. we are slowly working on things. it's awkward, but getting better. I've met his gf and been to his apartment.

I did talk to Justin more about how unfair it was, and he agreed. as Evan is no longer demanding it be a 'him-or-i' choice, the conversation with Justin was easier. I would say that I was planning to man up and tell him I would no longer agree to that situation, and I hope I would have actually done so. but the situation no longer exists. he also did try to pay for my ticket again when I came back, but I didn't accept his offer.
