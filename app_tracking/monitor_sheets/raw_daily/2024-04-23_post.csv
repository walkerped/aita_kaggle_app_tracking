0,1cbawvs,"AITA for setting boundaries with friends and standing up for myself?
","About 2 years ago I was coming to terms with being trans (27MTNB) and got super sick at the same time, so I took a hiatus from my friend group to deal with that. I didn't want to affect other people with my anxiety and I could tell that I wasn't handling the stress very well. I took about a 9 month break, and a few friends reached out to me, since we're all pretty close-knit and have been since we were kids.

‚Ä¢  Will - I've known him since we were about 2. My oldest friend and I've shared so many good and bad times with him. Confused but trying to be supportive about me being trans.

‚Ä¢ Vince - Old best friend, known since about 5. Used to be as close with him as I used to be with Will, if not closer. Started to become borderline white supremacist a few years ago. Used to be a good person, but there was some sort of shift in him and he became bitter. Transphobic.

‚Ä¢ Steve - Vince's new best friend. Has BPD but generally a good guy, and  decently trans positive, but he tends to do things for shock value. 

‚Ä¢ Gina - Only girl of the group. Bisexual, trans positive. Tries to keep some of the more nasty comments in check. (Racism, sexism, etc.) 

To start to re-intigrate, I joined back up with some of the group chats after coming out to Will, Steve, and Gina since I trusted them the most about having my back. I knew Vince would probably be hateful since he's said stuff in the past like ""If it were my choice I wouldn't give trans people their medication"" (Paraphrased, he's a pharmacist). Overall went pretty well coming back to the Facebook chat, no issues.

Then I tried to reintegrate with playing games with them on Discord. We have a server for just our close friends but it's not being used really anymore in favor of a more open server owned by Will and moderated by Vince and Steve. I joined that on the condition of I would leave if I encountered any transphobia, since it had some random people they like to play Destiny 2 with in it as well.

I was joking around and someone called me bro (which honestly, I don't have any issue with Will or other certain people calling me that, it was more so the issue that it was one of the people I wasn't comfortable with).

 I asked them to not call me that, and it ended up devolving into them saying:

‚Ä¢ I wasn't ""normal"" for putting my pronouns in my name

‚Ä¢ said he wouldn't ""cater to sissy mindset"" etc.

Vince's reaction as a mod was ""Reading the drama üçø"" which I should have expected, I don't really to expect them to understand me being trans since it's so new to them, but a lot of them said they expected and sort of knew. I just wanted to be treated with basic respect and not called slurs. So I left the server and just cut myself off again, since I figured they aren't people who would support me through this process.  I set the boundary that I would leave if people were transphobic, Will knew that boundary and didn't stick up for me, and neither did anyone else. Am I expecting too much or AITA?

1,1cavk41,AITA for not calling the lady that hit my car back?,"For context, I am a new driver. I just got my junior operator‚Äôs license last week and I started driving to school, driving with my sister to get ice cream, shopping, etc. April break came a few days later and my parents took themselves, my siblings, and a few of their friends on vacation. I opted out as I had gone on college tours over winter break and I really wanted to spend a week at home studying for upcoming AP exams. 

One day, I was coming home from a store and heading to get some lunch when I approached a crosswalk. There was a man walking by who looked like he wasn‚Äôt going to enter the crosswalk. Then, at the last moment, he ran into the road and I had to slam on my brakes. I would‚Äôve killed him if I hadn‚Äôt. When I thought all was well and I was safe to go, I felt a car come crashing into the rear end of my car and I jerked forward.

I am a very cautious driver. I don‚Äôt speed, I buckle up, I do everything that‚Äôs required of me to be safe while driving. I was only going 32 mph in a 30 mph zone. Clearly, the driver behind me had to have been riding my ass for her to hit me. And she was.

We pulled into a parking lot and the lady asked me if I was okay. This lady had to have been in her 60‚Äôs. She was driving a white Mercedes-Benz. Immediately, she accused me of going way too fast and criticized my driving. I was astonished and almost was brought to tears. I had no idea what to do in this situation as I am a brand new driver and never would‚Äôve expected anything like this to happen during my second week of driving with my license.

I only had a few scratches on my bumper (thank the Lord!) and the hood of her car was curved in a bit to the point where she couldn‚Äôt pop it open. She insisted that she take pictures of the damage and a picture of my license, to which I told her that I didn‚Äôt have an official license card yet, just a permit paper with the indication that I passed the driving exam at the bottom of the permit. She had a field day with this.

After the screaming, she told me that she would let this ‚Äúslide under the radar‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know it then because I believed that somehow I was in the wrong, but she was trying to make an insurance claim for this whole situation-something she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do successfully since SHE hit ME. So we parted ways after we exchanged numbers and she said she would call me to update me.

I told my parents and they said I absolutely shouldn‚Äôt contact her. They told me that she must‚Äôve wanted to make an insurance claim for this accident so that she wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the damage out-of-pocket. They also told me if I contact her, I could accidentally give permission for her to do things that would get me in trouble (not entirely sure what though.) She left me a voicemail saying she wanted to touch base with me and I haven‚Äôt responded at all.

2,1cava3x,WIBTA if I didn't tell someone their friend is a predator so I can protect my family? ,"Last July my daughter (Anna) turned 16.  Her dad and I, along with her 18 year old sister (Beth) went to dinner to celebrate.   Following dinner,  they wanted to go shopping.   Beth drove them to the store and my husband and I went home. 

While they were there,  we get a FaceTime call from them stating that a man is watching them and following them around the store.   Before they could get to security,  the man exposed himself and was touching himself.   They got safely to security and the police were called.  Despite being able to see him on camera,  the outdoor footage did not clearly show his license plate when he fled. 

A couple months later I get a call from the police.   He has done it again and this time,  they got his license plate,  they connected the two cases and he was arrested. 

We went to district court in early this year.  He was there with his wife who was wearing a t-shirt that said ""sorry,  not sorry"".  They have 5 young children together.   He was sentenced to 6 months.  He appealed and was released 3 weeks later.   He chose a jury trial in circuit court and that case is pending. 

My problem is that when I learned his name,  I researched him online.   He has previous charges for the same thing in 2018 and 2020.  I also looked him up on social media and found that we have a mutual friend,  Cara.   I became social media friends with Cara through a good friend, Delaney. Cara is really more of an acquaintance.  However,  we live close by to each other and her daughter plays on the same high school sports team as my daughter,  so I see her frequently. 

I feel torn regarding telling Cara.  I don't know her that well and I cannot tell online how good of friends she is with the predator and his wife (she's friends with both of them).  I'm worried if I tell Cara,  she may tell them who I am/where I live etc.   His behavior seems to be escalating and I'm concerned he could retaliate. I'm also worried that her children could be in danger if she's allowing them around this man.   Cara has 3 children,  her oldest being 16.

7,1caun0i,AITA for talking to a stranger's child?,"Hello Reddit, first time poster here. I (26M) was visiting a Go-Kart track in my city for the first time and took advantage of a holiday discount offer. While it was in no way cheap, it was still more affordable than regular pricing. In turn, it meant that there would be more customers.
The process to get racing goes like this: you get in line, get let in and take your kart and can start once the employee gives the group the go ahead. Then you drive for around 10-15minutes until you are to drive back in the pitlane and a new group of racers can take their turn rinse and repeat.

With all this backstory, now to the incident in question.
During my second run, i got stuck behind the child (Maybe 9-10years old?) in question. I couldn't overtake him given that he tried to use racing lines but also veered off, blocking the chance to overtake without crashing into him in the short track with many twist and turns. At the 2nd lap of being stuck behind him, he got the blue flag, the signal that someone faster is behind him and that he should slow down and pull to the side to let them pass.

He did not do that. So instead i got stuck for around 3-1/2laps behind him until the race was over and we had all had to get back into the pitlane. There I approched the kid and told him ""Hey kiddo. Just a reminder, if he (the employee) swings the blue flag, it means someone faster is behind you and you're meant to let them pass.""
Afterwards i waited in the lobby for the current round to pass to join the next and last one again.

Now, as I chatted with other people at the bar (non alcoholic) the kids father approched me, looking ready to fight and asked me what my problem was for me to talk to his son like that.
I really didn't understand cause i saw nothing wrong and told him as such, leading to him to explain that now, the child who was until then having a great time, was now feeling sad and defeated. After leaving, the other people who also took part in that race didn't understand the problem either.

As i wanted to join for the next round, the employee stopped me, telling me that it wasn't my place to reprimand other people, let alone children on the rules and that continued behaviour would get me banned.

I really didn't understand cause i saw nothing wrong and told him as such, leading to him to explain that now, the child who was until then having a great time, was now feeling sad and defeated. After leaving, the other people who also took part in that race didn't understand the problem either.

As i wanted to join for the next round, the employee stopped me, telling me that it wasn't my place to reprimand other people, let alone children on the rules and that continued behaviour would get me banned.

He does this often tho but he usually tells me bye when I'm next to him. When we started driving off my brother asked me who friend was and I just told him that that was friend. He then started questioning me more asking me why I never talked about him and stuff and then had the audacity to call me friendless (not true)? After a while I guess he got aggravated with me calling him friend and asked me what his 'real name' was. 

I told him that I honestly did not know and friend just started talking to me randomly one day. He got upset with me for not knowing his name and asked me how I didn't know. I told him that it was because he knew my name which was weird. I told him that I didn't want to ask him his name because that would just be embarrassing which is why I started calling him friend as a nickname and friend doesn't mind so he shouldn't either. 

He asked me if friend knew I didn't know his name and I said that I wasn't sure, prolly not and then he just got madder.

 I told him that I would have done the same thing but the difference was he didn't introduce him self or anything he just started talking to me like he knew me personally and that's why I never asked him.

Kevin's hobby is restoring old motorcycles, so he was showing me his latest project out in the garage. Even though I'm not a gearhead myself, Kevin and I have known each other for 20 years, and I can still admire good workmanship when I see it. 

Anyway, when we were almost done, Kevin's new girlfriend (we'll call her Taylor) came out to the garage with all sorts of attitude. It was obvious that she had just gotten home from work, since she was in office attire, and I tried saying hi to her, but she kind of blew me off and walked back inside. Apparently, Kevin was supposed to have started dinner but didn't because he was talking to me. I decided to stop Kevin in the garage for a moment so that we could have a man-to-man discussion. I told him that his ex-girlfriend (we'll call her Kerry) would never have treated us this way and asked what he saw in Taylor. 

Kevin seemed annoyed and insisted that he and Taylor are happy and that she's ""better for him anyway."" Kerry was a bartender and was a lot of fun, but Kevin said that she was ""too immature"" and ""not someone he could settle down with."" I was stunned by Kevin's lack of self-awareness. Here he was, having dated so many women that he could be choosy, while I was here single for the last three years. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for Kevin, but the man doesn't know how lucky he is. I suggested a compromise and said that if he's so good at getting women to date him, he should dump Taylor for being a bitch and find someone who's both mature and kind. 

Kevin gave me a scowl for a few seconds and said ""I think it's time for you to go."" Kevin had never been so blunt or so rude with me, and I think I hurt his feelings bad. I got in my car and left, but all of my text messages since getting home have gone unanswered. I told my roommate what happened, and he insisted that I was in the wrong. He also said that I should apologize to Kevin for what I said. I think it's such BS that I can't even go over to my friend's place and talk to him without his nasty girlfriend basically blaming me for being hungry.

15,1catngq,AITA for denying my boyfriend unlimited access to my vape? ,"This is really embarrassing but here we go. I‚Äôm 27F, he is 31M. 

My boyfriend and I live together. I pay rent, half of the bills, and he owns the home and pays a higher percentage of the mortgage payment. I also buy groceries for both of us. We both vape nicotine - yes I know, it‚Äôs a terrible habit that I am trying to quit but for now, the issue:
whenever I tell my boyfriend that I‚Äôd rather he didn‚Äôt hit my vape so much, it becomes a huge fight and he begins berating my character because he thinks I should share everything with him unconditionally. I don‚Äôt think this is fair, as I share literally every other thing without question, and I think when I use something of someone‚Äôs I either offer to buy them more or simply don‚Äôt ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù or their kindness and abuse the situation. For example if I use a lot of his face wash, I‚Äôll buy a new one and we both use that one until it‚Äôs finished. 

Side note: I don‚Äôt think everything in a relationship needs to be tit for tat by any means, I am only saying this because he made me feel as though I don‚Äôt contribute enough and should just let him hit the vape whenever he wants to.

He purchased dokha (tobacco) to smoke out of a pipe instead so that he would only hit it at home rather than having a constant source of nic nearby. When I started buying disposables again, he began hitting mine while we were at home or out/ in the car together. 

I didn‚Äôt mind sharing at first, but I began to get annoyed because he never purchased himself a vape ever again (he also has a reusable that he could buy juice for but anyway). It‚Äôs been about 6 months that he will consider my vapes, *our* vapes essentially, and I‚Äôve asked him why he doesn‚Äôt just repurchase juice or one for himself. His response: he doesn‚Äôt want to do that. On two occasions he‚Äôs offered to give me a few dollars to hit it unconditionally but I said no. 

I really just want to feel that if I say no, it can be respected. Things got out of hand tonight when this all came up again, and after I‚Äôd said no he asked me if this is really the kind of person I am, and  that he could find someone he ‚Äúoperates better with‚Äù and basically asked me to leave tonight. I tried to stay calm because this has happened before and I figured he was just angry and would apologize later. I asked if this is really how he felt and he said yes and that he needed to think about things. 

I waited a bit and then called him while he was out and asked if he was serious about me moving out etc but he doubled down saying that he doesn‚Äôt have this much friction with anyone else in his life and thinks this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue with someone else. This hurt. We‚Äôve been together for almost 7 years. 

Now I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I should just share with him unconditionally. Am I the asshole for not letting him use my vape whenever he wants to? He says he pays more for the house, which is true.

",Not the A-hole,2024-04-23,"AITA for denying my boyfriend unlimited access to my vape?  This is really embarrassing but here we go. I‚Äôm 27F, he is 31M. 

My boyfriend and I live together. I pay rent, half of the bills, and he owns the home and pays a higher percentage of the mortgage payment. I also buy groceries for both of us. We both vape nicotine - yes I know, it‚Äôs a terrible habit that I am trying to quit but for now, the issue:
whenever I tell my boyfriend that I‚Äôd rather he didn‚Äôt hit my vape so much, it becomes a huge fight and he begins berating my character because he thinks I should share everything with him unconditionally. I don‚Äôt think this is fair, as I share literally every other thing without question, and I think when I use something of someone‚Äôs I either offer to buy them more or simply don‚Äôt ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù or their kindness and abuse the situation. For example if I use a lot of his face wash, I‚Äôll buy a new one and we both use that one until it‚Äôs finished.

I was 15 at the time, Friend A was 16, Friend B had just turned 17. Friend B was moving away after the end of the school year, so we were trying to spend as much time with her as we could. Friend A however was working 2 jobs, on top of an AP art class and going into her senior year. We [ Me and Friend B ] tried to be supportive of her busy schedule and understood that even when she had time to hang out, she was exhausted. 

It seemed however, Friend A didn‚Äôt mind hanging out with her boyfriend at any time of the day or missing events or etc instead of friend B and me. 

Friend A‚Äôs boyfriend was also a total douche. He wasn‚Äôt just rude or disrespectful, some of his political beliefs were ridiculous ( he was a Neo-Nazi for example [ CRAZY IK ] ) and was very heavily into his beliefs. For a while we thought it was just a joke, regardless if it was inappropriate, we figured he just had a very fucked sense of humor. Not only that, he seemed to actively hate friend B and me, making snarky comments, being rude and disrespectful for absolutely no reason, shitting on our names, and almost manipulating friend A into hating us. 

The finally breaking point was when he continued to make comments on Friend B‚Äôs ethnic food saying it smelled disgusting, looked atrocious, etc. This made Friend B pretty uncomfortable and she started to not eat because of it and sit in the library. after a while, i went to sit with her and we discussed his behavior and how it made us both uncomfortable.

He made excuses that he was Schizophrenic and his mood shifted a lot

Friend A got really mad at us, saying he was joking around, and regardless it still made us uncomfortable that he would make those jokes. [ for example about the jokes, they would be racist, sexist, he would make fun of special ed kids in his class and gossip about them ] [ he also claimed he could make racist jokes because he was black ]. we started arguing and it led to us cutting contact completely.

fast forward 5 months, i reached out to friend A. friend B had already moved and i was keeping contact with her the best I could and still am. friend a seemed to be okay with becoming friends again only to text me basically saying she felt she would be disrespecting herself by letting me back into her life. needless to say, i was furious and didnt attempt to reach out anymore.

19,1catbfl,AITA for saying I don't want my aunt in my car? ," A bit of backstory, my (f21) aunt (fLate40s) has done a LOT of awful things. My family always excused it because she had a bad childhood. She has no relationship with her kids as she didn't even raise them for the majority of their lives. When I was 17-18 she would take me out to eat to 'spend time with her niece' but every time she would dump all of her problems on me. She was a bad influence and tried to get me try smoking stuff behind my parents back as soon as I was 18 (I said no). She had my sister (F16) try a sip of her drink without asking my parents.
 My uncle (not blood related, uncle through love) and her used to date. Those times she took me out to eat was with his money as he is decently wealthy and she used that a lot. Their relationship was very off and on again (by her choice). He always took her back no matter what. We told him many times that she was using him but he didn't listen as he loved her. 
 There was a time where he asked her to marry him and she said no because she was seeing a married man. That man left his his wife and kid to marry her and they divorced a month later. My uncle still took her back.
 A few months ago, about Januany or Febuary, she had come to visit and my uncle was with her. She rode to Sunday night church in my car with me and my sister since my parents car was full. At the time I still had a decent relationship with her but we weren't close. On the drive back home she told me and my sister that she was planning to leave my uncle in March as she didn't love him. When we got home there was a moment she sat on his lap for a minute and kissed him before walking off. I was pissed but she asked me not to tell him. I was being forced to choose him or her and didn't know what to do. I wish I had told him.
 She was living in my uncle's home and he caught her using some harder stuff again. He kicked her out but she refused to leave. It took at least a week to get her to leave and she stole his tvs.
 A month ago it came out that my adult male cousin (her son) was doing bad things to my 7 year old female cousin. She defended him and and helped him run from the cops since she believed that he didn't do it. As soon as I was told this I went no contact with her.
 A few days ago she called my dad (she has used my parents many times but my dad is a pushover) and I heard him say something about a car. My parents were borrowing my car while theirs were in the shop. I told my mom I don't want her in my car. She claimed that I was being spiteful because I was mad but I don't think so.

Even though we were teenagers, my brother being an adult, we still aren't allowed to curse in front of our family, due to a rule they set when we were 11 and 13 years old. 

Even though I was sick of it, all the insults and chasing, I still think I could be the a-hole. He never used curses in the insults and said he meant it in a playful manner. He seemed really hurt by it, and I could tell because he went silent. but I didn't care in the moment. I was sick of it. However, that's up for judgement.",0.0,-0.007758313,0,1
23,1casf8y,AITA: Wearing the same color Prom dress as my friend,"Hey guys! I‚Äôve never posted on Reddit and I am hoping I do this correctly! Here‚Äôs my dilemma: So I am a 18F going to Prom with 17M and our friend group 18F, 18F and 18M. So there are 3 girls, two boys. Backstory is that I met a guy (17F) and this friend group at a church event and became super close with them. I am currently going to a school in which I am the only senior (small sports academy with <100 students). I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have the chance to probably go to Prom and I was so heartbroken. But, the 17M I am going with now promposed to me about two to three weeks ago. Although extremely excited and grateful for the opportunity to go, now the hunt for a prom dress started and the real issues begin. 

One of the 18F in our group demands that we all are wearing different colors about a week ago. I at first was okay with this as I thought there would probably be no clash with colors until I learned the same girl had bought a purple dress (which I was looking for too). I was at first upset but looked for another color to avoid any drama. But after looking for weeks with a smaller budget (200-300 dollars) and a bad selection, I thought I was at a loss until I found a dress today. It‚Äôs a purple dress (not the same shade or style but it‚Äôs purple). I loved it on me and I felt so beautiful. I felt like a princess. 

I texted 18F asking if this was okay since the dresses were drastically pretty differently style wise and shade wise but still purple. After that text ensued a huge argument in which I am told ‚Äúthis has happened to me before‚Äù (a prior event where her BFF at the time wore the same EXACT dress to HOCO) and ‚Äúwe are going to clash‚Äù.  I offered to not be in any group photos after she says ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt care but she won‚Äôt do a group photo because it will make use blend together‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt helpful. 

I ended up buying the dress because I feel like I am being walked all over but maybe I am wrong? I feel so sick to my stomach right now and feel regret for buying the dress I really love. AITA?

26,1carx3d,AITA for calling people out on fouls while playing pickup basketball? ,"Note: knowing the general rules of basketball might help understand this better but not required. 

Last night at my adult 30+ basketball league that I‚Äôve been attending weekly for almost a year with no verbal altercation issues, I got into it with a couple of new guys that showed up. I have never seen them before and they both didn‚Äôt understand the rules of the game. Guy A, kept setting moving screens like an offensive lineman. I called him out on it and he admitted he didn‚Äôt know the rules so I explained it to him. Then the next possession when I was on offense, I was cutting to the hoop and guy B was holding my arm as I was driving. I called my own foul and the guy threw his hands up and was complaining I called the foul. I explained the rules and he rolled his eyes and said I was complaining too much about that and about calling guy A about the moving screens.

These are the basic rules of basketball and they were both upset about my ‚Äúcomplaints‚Äù. Everyone else that was playing were regulars and guy A was called out by 2 other people for moving screens to which he responded negatively. Me calling them both out was definitely the loudest and most verbal altercation of the night but I was fed up with these two guys showing up who clearly didn‚Äôt know how to play and made it seem like I was the bad guy. Everyone else just watched and none of the regulars stood up for me which was annoying but I get that a lot of people don‚Äôt like to insert themselves into things. 

So I‚Äôm feeling like I did something wrong with the way they reacted but I know I‚Äôm in the right with how the game should be played. My approach can sometimes come off brash when I call people out but that‚Äôs par for the course with pickup and emotions/adrenaline. 

I know I should just let it go but felt like typing this out and seeking other perspectives to see if my feelings are justified or if I could have handled it differently. I‚Äôm an emotional/sensitive guy so this is affecting me a little more than it should. 

TLDR: 
Last night at my regular adult basketball league, I had a verbal altercation with two new players over rules. One player set illegal screens and the other fouled me but complained when I called it. Despite explaining the rules, they disagreed, leading to a heated exchange. The regular players didn't intervene, which bothered me. I feel conflicted about the situation and wonder if I could've handled it better. My emotional reaction is affecting me more than it should. Seeking perspectives on whether my feelings are justified or if I should have approached it differently.

27,1carqbt,WIBTA For Skipping Mother's Day With MIL This Year?,"My (34 F) Husband (41 M) and I are about to have our second child, and I've had a horrible pregnancy. It turns out I have a complication where I'll need to be induced early, about 2 days before mother's day this year. Because I've had such an awful time with this pregnancy, I really don't want visitors at the hospital, or at home for the first couple weeks. 

The problem is every year mother's day is a huge ordeal. My husband and his mom (69 F) don't really get along, so he rarely wants to go to her house for mother's day (though we always get pressured into it anyway).  I lost my own mom as a teenager so mother's day is always hard for me, but when I've expressed that to my MIL her response is usually along the lines of ""but it's my day too"". She and I do not have a bad relationship like 90% of the time, so when I had my first child she did make an effort to celebrate me too. I just still don't enjoy mother's day, and don't like celebrating it because it reminds me too much of my mom. 

The major complication this year is that my husband's younger brother died late last year, so this will be my MIL's first mother's day without him here. My husband and I both hate the idea of her being sad on mother's day, but I genuinely cannot handle being around anyone 2 days after I give birth following a pretty traumatic pregnancy (almost especially because I've had to go through this without my own mom).

I'm dreading the conversation with MIL because I know it won't go well. My husband has no issue having the conversation with her, but she often doesn't respect him or his boundaries, so sometimes things have to come from me for her to take it seriously.

I reached out, apologized, and offered them their choice of ANY of my other animals that I had for sale. I also told them that I would be getting a few more animals very similar to the one they'd wanted. For a while, they continued to talk to me as if they weren't too upset.

I was pretty horrified. I said to her that it seemed like an awful way to make a kid stop biting people.

I feel bad because I feel like i‚Äôve really messed up, but all my friends are telling me it‚Äôs not a big deal and that she needs to get over it, especially because i don‚Äôt even like him. What do y‚Äôall think?

Long story short, Marcus and Courtney broke up a week or two ago because Courtney started dating one of my daughter's male friends, who were supposedly ""Barely acquainted"" before they started dating. When my son found out, he started to actively avoid Mias everywhere because he believes my daughter set them up together while he was dating his gf, even though my daughter swears she didn't intervene or was involved in anything.

33,1caqsbc,WIBTA for asking children to stop soliciting cars to honk for them?,"I'm somewhat sleep deprived, so I defer to Reddit's judgement.

I (37F) live in a residential neighborhood with a fair amount of kids. My house is only 3 down from an elementary school and playground. 

For the last week or so, a small group of children (5-8 kids, my guess on ages is 7-12) have been congregating on the sidewalk corner of the cul-de-sac directly across from my house. While there they encourage every vehicle that passes to honk for them. They do so by yelling ""honk"", making the truck honk gesture, and most recently by holding up signs.

This first happened on a Friday evening and there were 5 kids. The street I live on is the main one in the neighborhood and connects to 2 major roads in town, so it gets a lot of traffic. By my unofficial estimate they were able to get 2/3 to honk. I want to point out that these children are not running a lemonade stand, aren't selling anything, aren't promoting anything, aren't affiliated with any group/cause. They just like getting cars to honk.

The first time, I was annoyed. Mostly because I work swing shifts, including 3rds, so I was trying to sleep when they did it. Also because I have a 1.5 y/o dog that I'm still trying to train (specifically on barking, he's trained on most other things). Not only does he start barking but he also just seems confused and anxious with the frequent honking. While I was annoyed, I had zero thought to say anything or try to stop the kids, as I figured it was a 1 off situation and they were just being kids.

However, since then they have continued this activity. They also scream and shriek at loud volumes, and other children have now joined the original group. The cars have gotten so used to it that they almost always honk, some doing an extended lay on the horn honk. The kids usually start around 4pm on school days and will stay anywhere from 2 hours to until it gets dark which isn't until like 9pm. (It's not constant, they go in for a bit for dinner, and sometimes they get caught up in playing some other game, but 8/10 past days they've been soliciting honks for 1-2 hours at the very least.

I use earplugs when trying to sleep during the day but car horns, especially since they are honking right in front of my house, still come through. I'm missing sleep. My dog has regressed with their anxiety. Part of my job is providing care to people and with how foggy my brain has been due to lack of sleep, I'm worried I may make a mistake that could be harmful to my clients.

I'm working close to 50 hour weeks and averaging 4 hours of sleep a day right now.

WIBTA if I approached the kids and asked them to please stop requesting cars honk for them? I would try to be as polite as possible and explain how/why it's impacting me.

He points out that I've told him in the past his loyalty and work ethic is one of the things I found attractive and always supported. Well 2.5 years in I'm missing him, I feel alone and isn't it him making us wait?

firstly, I would say that I really did take into consideration a lot of the comments that said I've been punished by the family enough. Evan has the right to still be mad but after this length of time I think it's time the rest of my family start treating me as an equal member again.

I did fly home for the wedding. the friend who I was on vacation with was very agreeable to me going. I know the judgement was that I would not be TA for skipping, but I was just too scared to lose Justin too. Yes, I wanted to have the conversation about him treating me equally now, but to do that I first needed him to be speaking with me.

Unexpectedly, Justin actually picked me up from the airport. he was immediately apologetic for how he talked to me and the position he put me in in forcing me to fly home, and recognized it wasn't right or fair. he even offered to pay the cost of my tickets. I accepted his apology, but told him we could talk about it more later, it was his wedding day and the focus should be on him and that.

we drove to the hotel where he and my parents and the other groomsmen, including Evan where you staying. Evan came to my room shortly after I checked in. It wasn't a happy movie scene where we hugged and all was forgiven, it was really awkward, two people on eggshells. we just sorta agreed to have a good day for Justin, and talk at some later point. in the end I am glad I went to the wedding, as unfair as Justin asking was, it was pretty clear that having both me and Evan there that day meant a lot to him. I flew back out the next day to meet my friend.

since I've been back Evan and I have been talking and have met up. I've apologized again, but also he has forcing me out. he was (understandably) mad at me, and said he just could never seem to move past being mad, and it became easier to stay mad. but he missed me, he's wanted to call and then backed off doing so. we are slowly working on things. it's awkward, but getting better. I've met his gf and been to his apartment.

I did talk to Justin more about how unfair it was, and he agreed. as Evan is no longer demanding it be a 'him-or-i' choice, the conversation with Justin was easier. I would say that I was planning to man up and tell him I would no longer agree to that situation, and I hope I would have actually done so. but the situation no longer exists. he also did try to pay for my ticket again when I came back, but I didn't accept his offer.

38,1cbk1jb,AITA for not wanting to come to my daughters birthday party?,"So I had my daughter when I was really young, I was 16 at the time. I wasn't exactly the best dad, I had addiction issues - drugs, alcohol and gambling. I ended up getting arrested for the first time when I was 19. I've been in and out of jail for the last few years. When I was first arrested, me and my ex decided it would be best if I wasn't in the picture for my daughters safety and I agreed. She got married at 21 to someone else and I was happy that my daughter had a proper family even if I wasn't part of it. 

My ex has been sending me updates every few months on our daughter, how she's doing at school etc which I've always appreciated. She even sent money to me when I was in prison which I never asked her to but I did appreciate it.
A few weeks ago she reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to come to our daughters birthday party, she told me that she and her husband got divorced a few months ago and that she told our daughter about me and wanted us to spend some time together.

My ex has been sending me updates every few months on our daughter, how she's doing at school etc which I've always appreciated. She even sent money to me when I was in prison which I never asked her to but I did appreciate it.

I have little faith that she will be quiet or respect my sleep as she rarely does, which will likely only worsen if her friend is over. I told her truthfully if she asked any other weekend, I would have agreed, but I have two difficult finals back-to-back and need my rest.   
Sophie responded that we didn't need the other person's opinion, as discussed in our roommate agreement. Our agreement states we need to check with the other person, but I feel it is common sense to have the other person's permission before inviting a friend to stay in our shared space overnight.

As an adult I never go home for \*anything\* and haven't since I was 21. I am 33 now.

My mom has always given/sent me a really sweet card she picks out by herself with $15 or so to treat myself to lunch. She's been doing this since I was a young adult and when I was younger we used to go out together and get breakfast, or something like that. It was so special to me. Since we can't do that anymore, as an adult the card itself is the stand in for that. 

Last year, possibly after talking to my dad who never has been involved in this, she said she will no longer be sending me a birthday card in the mail anymore. I asked why and she said she thinks they're silly and we live in a world where email is the same thing and it's what my dad prefers. I told her it's not the same thing to me, that I save all the cards she sends me and, idk, it's our a thing, the one thing we have. A digital card where they have 30 choices and is sent the day of to my inbox isn't the same. But my mom was adamant and also asked me to stop sending them cards for their birthdays, mother's day, father's day (which yeah I do send) etc.

I explained that while I appreciate the effort as I explained last year it is just not the same to me as having one mom picked out by hand, wrote in, and sent to me. The only point of me accepting/opening a card to begin with was because of our tradition and mom/he decided to break it for whatever reason.

To be clear, this isn't an issue of trying to cut back on waste (they don't recycle) nor is it a religious issue, nor is it a frugality issue (they're wealthy) nor have I ever said my dad can't pick out a card and sign it/have my mom sign it in the same way she has.

I had made a promise to my ex boyfriend/roommate that I would not allow my mother to be in the apartment without me before he went away on business (he‚Äôs still away) 

While I can see it would make the most sense to just be here when my parents come up, I really don‚Äôt want this to happen at all.

48,1cbhj4j,"AITA for being annoyed my roommate want's to keep a ""stray"" cat","So here's the situation.

I (22M) live in an apartment with a 23F, a 22M and two cats. We've lived together for going on 4 years now. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate (23F) met this stray cat. Super friendly, talkitive, and seemingly well-groomed. She wanted to bring it home, but ultimately decided against it. Fast-foward to this morning, and she has allowed the cat to follow her up three flights of stairs into our apartment and has sequestered it to the patio. Here are the issues I have.

1: It has a collar. When we first saw it, it did not have a collar. It hasn't lost any weight, it's super people-friendly, and it is cool enough with the apartments to follow a human up three flights of stairs. These factors lead me to believe this is someone's outdoor cat (hence the ""stray"" remark). I feel morally wrong with keeping it and not at least attempting to find the owner. My roommate has said she believes the same, but has made more than enough arguments as to why ""we should just keep the cat."" ""I wouldn't just let the cat out... what if they aren't taking care of him... he could die outside..."" etc. etc. It's obvious she wants the cat, which is fine. But I'll admit that her bringing this cat all the way into the apartment and just expecting everything to slide is annoying me.

2: It seems like a male cat (haven't inspected yet). It being a male cat is an issue for me. The two cats that I've had for 3+ years are mine, and they are female. This cat is pretty big, and if things were to go south it's got the 2v1 easy. Not that it is a guarantee that anything bad would happen, but we know nothing about this cat. The amount of effort and work that we would HAVE to do to ensure my cats are safe around this cat is a lot, and now it's being lumped on us. I kind of hate that we are now being forced to do so. Because the other possibility is not keeping the cat, which would make me feel like a huge asshole to my roommate.

I realize I could just tell her these things, but I don't appreciate needless confrontation. Also, now matter how I word it, I fear I'll just come off as saying ""No, you don't get to have this cat because I already have cats,"" which is not the case. I've made it very clear that both of my roommates are allowed to get animals. My 22M roommate tried to have a dog at one point, that ended for completely separate reasons. I would love for my 23F roommate to have a cat for emotional support. Would I be happier if the cat was acquired from a vet? 100%. But I do not want to let that bias effect how I am viewing this. I just don't feel like this is the appropriate way to introduce a third cat into our lives.

TL/DR: It seems like the ""stray"" my roommate grabbed is someone else's because it has a collar, among other things. I'm not 100% ok with it being around my cats, and I don't like that she wants to keep someone else's cat. I would feel like an asshole voicing these concerns.

59,1cbfw1a,AITA For not letting my grandma watch my baby?,"So my husband (25M) and I (21F) are first-time parents to our little girl (1mth). Im a SAHM, and I am with my baby majority of the time while my husband works. She is the most perfect baby I have ever met. She hardly cries unless she's hungry, needs a diaper change, or just wants to contact nap. Here's where the problem starts:

My husband works 10-12 hours every day, 5-6 days a week. This means I am home with my baby alone anywhere from 8-10am to 8-11pm. I have brought my baby everywhere with me so far, even if it's more of a hassle to bring her along. My grandma (58F) has begged to take her for a few hours to allow me alone time or to get things done around the house. There are a few reasons why I won't allow her to watch my baby
1. She smokes in her car/house. Neither me nor my husband smoked, and I've clearly stated I don't want my baby around it either.
2. She has an ankle-bitter dog that snaps and growls at little kids.
3. She disrespected and disregarded my every wish throughout my pregnancy and delivery.

So, a little tid bit of backstory. My mother and I have lived with her since i was 14. My mom was very sick and needed someone to care for her daily. My grandma was that person. I moved out of state when i turned 18 but moved back home a year and a half later.

 My mom passed away last year, and since then, my grandma has tried to be a ""mother figure"" in my life, even though we were not close when my mom passed. When my husband and I got married, my grandma made everything look good and convinced my husband and I to move in with her to save money. It turned out we just recently moved into our own home in January. It cause mine and her relationship to plummet. Never seeing each other even though we are practically neighbors. Only calling.

Since we've moved into our home, and had our baby, my grandma has been calling every day and telling me I ""need"" to let her watch my baby so I can do things I need to do. That I'm being stingy with MY baby. That I need to go visit the rest of the family because their feelings are hurt that I didn't invite them to see the baby at the hospital. (We wanted no visitors, but my grandma invited people without our consent). She is saying that I am the AH and causing family to be upset even though they never called or text throughout the pregnancy. 

I'm standing my ground on my decision, and my husband's family agrees with me, but now my family are all agreeing with her and calling me the AH. So, AITA for not letting my grandma watch my baby?

I just want to say that I have offered her to come spend time with the baby over at my house. I've told her she can visit anytime. That never happens. She wants to take the baby to her house to watch her. I've visited at her house multiple times, although I never stayed longer than 30-45 minutes. When the baby was first born, we didn't keep the doors locked to our home as most people would knock right? That's what a sane human being would do. But she doesn't. She tries to just walk into my home without knocking or letting us know she is coming. She says that she shouldnt have to knock. She pulls the ""I'm getting old and feeble"" card every time.

Anyways, I said it couldn't have been me because I made sure the door was shut when I left. We have another roommate who was there the whole time too, but they are good friends.

I said that if she has a problem with what I do to send me a list of everything so that I can fix it, as I would have if she had told me at the time(s) of the occurrences. I said that, given you only want to talk to me, that I don't have the time or mental capacity for drama or a misguided ambush. To that, she responded calling me inconsiderate and saying that I don't care. She has asked me to do two things: clean up the kitchen when I am done cooking and make sure that there isn't hair in the drain after I shower. I do both of these things every time and I said that. Now she's saying that there is always hair when I'm done in the bathroom. I know for a fact that I always clean the hair from the drain. It's a bathroom, there will be hair.

63,1cbfjux,AITA for not keep mentoring my friend in her new position?,"Ok, so my friend \[37F\] and I \[33M\] were running for the same position at another company without each-other's knowledge at first. She and I have been friends from some years now and I was her boss in our previous company until I got a position in my current company and she got promoted to another department.

We always were so professional at work and never had any personal issue there. Then, I got my current job a few years back and she stayed in our previous company but in a new role in other department, she was so excited, and we remained friends even after that, great friends to be honest.  
Thing is that without we us knowing, we both applied to the same company and the same position, for me it would have been a horizontal move, for her it was definitely a promotion, she had never had a leadership position so we both were excited for each other, it wasn't matter which one of us got selected.

Well, she got the position, I don't. I was bumped at first but at the same time truly happy for her. We got to celebrate, and things were good. I talked to my boyfriend that since this was a position two levels above her previous one, I was afraid she couldn't meet the initial expectations of the company, but I was there to support her as long as I can.

Thing is that first month and she already texted me daily, almost during the whole day. There is a lot of things that she knew how to do as an Analyst, but she didn't have the experience as manager to build from scratch, so she was getting a hard time. Initially I was happy helping her, but now I'm so tired, I feel like I have two jobs (and one of them is ad-honorem). I talked to my friend about this and told her that she either hired me as a consultant/mentor or please keep consulting as low as possible since it was so tiring for me; she got mad and said that I was just being jealous of her getting the position instead of me and that I'm not being a good friend by denying her ""this little help"" (she said) and that if money would've enough to get more energy, then I'm just being ambitious and I want to make money at her expense, that since she is older and she hasn't have the opportunity of a managing position I should considerer her needs instead of thinking about money.

So, AITA for not keep mentoring her?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-23,"AITA for not keep mentoring my friend in her new position? Ok, so my friend \[37F\] and I \[33M\] were running for the same position at another company without each-other's knowledge at first. She and I have been friends from some years now and I was her boss in our previous company until I got a position in my current company and she got promoted to another department.

We always were so professional at work and never had any personal issue there. Then, I got my current job a few years back and she stayed in our previous company but in a new role in other department, she was so excited, and we remained friends even after that, great friends to be honest.  
Thing is that without we us knowing, we both applied to the same company and the same position, for me it would have been a horizontal move, for her it was definitely a promotion, she had never had a leadership position so we both were excited for each other, it wasn't matter which one of us got selected.

Well, she got the position, I don't. I was bumped at first but at the same time truly happy for her. We got to celebrate, and things were good. I talked to my boyfriend that since this was a position two levels above her previous one, I was afraid she couldn't meet the initial expectations of the company, but I was there to support her as long as I can.

Thing is that first month and she already texted me daily, almost during the whole day. There is a lot of things that she knew how to do as an Analyst, but she didn't have the experience as manager to build from scratch, so she was getting a hard time. Initially I was happy helping her, but now I'm so tired, I feel like I have two jobs (and one of them is ad-honorem). I talked to my friend about this and told her that she either hired me as a consultant/mentor or please keep consulting as low as possible since it was so tiring for me; she got mad and said that I was just being jealous of her getting the position instead of me and that I'm not being a good friend by denying her ""this little help"" (she said) and that if money would've enough to get more energy, then I'm just being ambitious and I want to make money at her expense, that since she is older and she hasn't have the opportunity of a managing position I should considerer her needs instead of thinking about money.

Things escalated, now she is walking in a thin line since she might be fired for not meeting the expectations and that would devastate her; my boyfriend says that I should help her a few more, but I can't get off of the feeling of being taken advantage of.

Sunday comes and I call her, she says her car is still in the shop and she needs my car until Tuesday. I then couldn‚Äôt get ahold of her after Tuesday. I heard later that she didn‚Äôt pay to get her car fixed and  she stopped paying her car payments and they repossessed it.

Fast forward, she‚Äôs had my car for 7 months, I ask her if she wants to buy my car, we agreed on a price, she said yes, and at the 1 year mark of her having it, she would have enough money to pay me for it. Until then, the car would stay in my name and I didn‚Äôt give her the title. I also mentioned to her that I bought the yearly tag this year, but next year she would need to, since the car is only mine in name. I also told her that I didn‚Äôt want to keep paying for car insurance on a car I don‚Äôt drive. She gave me her sob story of ‚Äúno one ever helps me‚Äù and that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so hard to get by‚Äù and a bunch of other (what sounds like) excuses to not want to pay. My family and my grandma (her mom) all help her out a lot, so I was calling bs in my head. I lowered the plan from full coverage to the lowest premium they had. 

The 1 year mark came and I‚Äôve heard nothing from her. Later on in the months, I heard that she didn‚Äôt get the money she was counting on because she didn‚Äôt do anything on her part. Since then, she‚Äôs borrowed more money from me for her rent, light bills, and other miscellaneous things which I have on record. 

Damage to the car includes (to my knowledge): 
hit a deer which busted the hood and the right front light(replaced), 
had one of the windows of the car smashed out(replaced), 
hit another deer which messed the hood up even worse and took out the left front light(replaced but the hood is horrendous). 
All of the lights are flashing on the dashboard in a way I‚Äôve never seen before, and the interior is destroyed, I‚Äôm guessing from my younger cousins. 

I‚Äôm trying to be patient & understanding with her because she‚Äôs trying to make it, but when she keeps accumulating debt & never pays you back it gets kinda frustrating. And if you don‚Äôt help her once she‚Äôll go off saying that no one ever tries to help her or that she‚Äôs all alone trying to take care of the kids. 

Back to the title, it‚Äôs been almost 2 and a half years since she‚Äôs borrowed my car and I get sad every time I see the deteriorated version of the car I once loved. I‚Äôve mentioned to sue for my money only to be asked if I‚Äôd really take the car and leave them all stranded an hour away.

I don‚Äôt mind having to wait a little longer and usually when they see that they made a pregnant girl doing the peepee dance wait they apologize, but today the only open stall didn‚Äôt have toilet paper so I was waiting for a different stall and one of the girls blew smoke on me.

I don‚Äôt want to be a snitch but at this point the smell of vapes or pens makes me literally gag and now they‚Äôre blowing smoke on me as well. I just ahhh.

The first time my mother-in-law suggested it, I politely told them that I don't like it but she didn't have anything else so she served it and I had do without.
Now, she has served the same thing the last three times without any alternative and I'm considering bringing something myself so I also have something to snack on while playing. My partner seems to not understand why I feel annoyed but he also the type of person who barely have anything he doesn't eat.

So, WIBTA if I brought my own snacks?

We have had a couple of disagreements before, but nothing that we couldn't work out by the end of the day.

We both work office jobs, however, she has more experience in the corporate world than I do. Because of this, I often ask for advice in certain situations or ask her to proofread some emails before I send emails.

Last Thursday morning during our morning chat, she expressed to me she was in a poor mood because of her colleagues. I responded saying I could relate because my director had annoyed me that morning. I then sent her what happened. She then messaged me saying ""you're both wrong"", to which I responded ""well I'm not asking who's wrong"". She then replied ""Hey don't give it to me lol"" then a separate message saying ""damn"". Knowing her, I know well enough that she was being passive aggressive. I text her back saying ""my god"" and ""yeah damn"".

However, I was slightly annoyed because of her response, so I text her saying her response was bitchy and unnecessary and that I know she was in a bad mood but I did nothing to deserve an attitude from her. She read the message and never responded.

I did not ask for her advice, I did not ask who was wrong, I didn't ask anything. I assumed we would have a laugh at my directors ""stupidity"", talk a little shit, and get on with our day.

Now, I don't expect flowers and an apology card. As I mentioned before, this is a minor spat. However, I did expect some sort of dialogue from her...a ""no I wasn't being bitchy wtf"" or a ""yeah my bad, I'm having a shit day, I'll talk to you when I'm in a better mood"". That's how we usually communicate. Instead I haven't spoken to her since then.

I don't feel that I should be the one to break the ice, nor would I even know what to say. So WIBTA if I maintain this mindset and not reach out?

  
EDIT TO ADD: I see a few people saying I changed the subject to speak about myself. However, way before I sent the screenshot. I told her I was sorry she was feeling that way and I agreed that her situation was indeed annoying, then I asked if she got a previous work issue figured out. There were a few unrelated messages back and forth, then I sent the message.

We both are supportive with each other and ask about each others feelings when the other expresses they are upset about something. Which I did, then followed with the screenshot.

   I got married to the love of my life in 2021, and I had asked my best friend, who basically was my little sister, to be my MOH. She'd accepted and was all about helping me, until she wasn't. I had to plan EVERYTHING. She didn't set up my bachelorette party, my mom did. She didn't go with me to pick my dress. My mom and aunt did. She didn't set up my bridal shower, my mom did. She would have regular freak out episodes weekly, where I would tell her ""Hey, dude if this is too much for you you don't have to do it I can ask someone else I'm legit not mad,"" repeatedly, but she'd insist on doing it. Nothing got done, I had to do it all myself, or my mom did what she could. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

   The day before the wedding was the bachelorette party, which was low key and just me and my girls playing games and drinking at a hotel. She was there, got blackout drunk, and left the hotel to go meet up with some hook-up she'd just met on tinder or something. She didn't show back up until 5am, and passed out. We were supposed to be up and getting ready so the photographer could do the pre-wedding photos of us doing makeup and hair... She spent the entire time in the shower, so I got maybe three photos total before we went to the venue to finish getting ready. She didn't show up, instead she had to go to the corner store to get razors cause she needed to shave her legs, instead of helping me get into my wedding gown.

After the ceremony, we did photos, and when it came time for the food and speeches, she was nowhere to be found. She'd gone back to the hotel room, with the boy from tinder, and had sex with him on the honeymoon suite bed, and left it dirty; she left the do not disturb on the door so nothing was clean or replaced and it was a disaster, the sheets were  crumpled behind the door and everything. I know she did, because I found the condom wrapper in the trash. 

I let it go for the rest of the day, and honestly for the week while we were on our honeymoon. When we got back, she kept trying to call and message me, and I hadn't found the words yet to tell her just how angry I was. I finally did, and told her that I never should have asked her to be my MOH. Ever. I honestly should have just asked someone else after the first time she'd called me crying about how she didn't think she could do it. She'd vanished, and ultimately tried to sabotage what was supposed to be the best day of my life. She proceeded to call me a narcissist and selfish (because I wanted MY WEDDING DAY to run smoothly).

   I got married to the love of my life in 2021, and I had asked my best friend, who basically was my little sister, to be my MOH. She'd accepted and was all about helping me, until she wasn't. I had to plan EVERYTHING. She didn't set up my bachelorette party, my mom did. She didn't go with me to pick my dress. My mom and aunt did. She didn't set up my bridal shower, my mom did. She would have regular freak out episodes weekly, where I would tell her ""Hey, dude if this is too much for you you don't have to do it I can ask someone else I'm legit not mad,"" repeatedly, but she'd insist on doing it. Nothing got done, I had to do it all myself, or my mom did what she could. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

   The day before the wedding was the bachelorette party, which was low key and just me and my girls playing games and drinking at a hotel. She was there, got blackout drunk, and left the hotel to go meet up with some hook-up she'd just met on tinder or something. She didn't show back up until 5am, and passed out. We were supposed to be up and getting ready so the photographer could do the pre-wedding photos of us doing makeup and hair... She spent the entire time in the shower, so I got maybe three photos total before we went to the venue to finish getting ready. She didn't show up, instead she had to go to the corner store to get razors cause she needed to shave her legs, instead of helping me get into my wedding gown.

After the ceremony, we did photos, and when it came time for the food and speeches, she was nowhere to be found. She'd gone back to the hotel room, with the boy from tinder, and had sex with him on the honeymoon suite bed, and left it dirty; she left the do not disturb on the door so nothing was clean or replaced and it was a disaster, the sheets were  crumpled behind the door and everything. I know she did, because I found the condom wrapper in the trash. 

I let it go for the rest of the day, and honestly for the week while we were on our honeymoon. When we got back, she kept trying to call and message me, and I hadn't found the words yet to tell her just how angry I was. I finally did, and told her that I never should have asked her to be my MOH. Ever. I honestly should have just asked someone else after the first time she'd called me crying about how she didn't think she could do it. She'd vanished, and ultimately tried to sabotage what was supposed to be the best day of my life. She proceeded to call me a narcissist and selfish (because I wanted MY WEDDING DAY to run smoothly).

82,1cbbgzf,AITA for not wanting daughter's Bio mother at graduation?,"4 years ago I legally adopted my Bonus Daughter by her request because her Bio mom is/was a drug addict and had neglected/abadoned her on more than one occasion from Infancy through 10.

 The last straw happened when she was 11 and came to live with her father and myself full time because Bio mom was on yet another binge and nobody had seen her in months. She left Bonus Daughter with her grandmother and went missing. Hubby and I got word of what happened and We went and picked her up, filed for full custody, the whole 9 yards.

3 years later after 0 contact from her she shows up, on drugs of course, and pregnant with a random guys kid. That is when Bonus Daughter asked me to adopt her because as her words "" you've been present in my life more in the past few years than my mom has my whole life"" . Not long after this her Bio mom has the baby, who was taken by CPS because of neonatal addiction and she disappears again. Parental Severance and Adoption go through uncontested. Life is peaceful...

Fast forward to now. Daughter recently turned 18 and is getting ready to graduate.  She asks her extended family on Bio moms side to come to her graduation,  which I am completely fine with since she has maintained contact with them ( they didnt abandon her) . But she was asked if she wanted her bio mom to be there.  She told them she does but at the same time she doesn't because she doesn't know how it would make her feel to see her in person again, but at the same time she knows is still her bio mom so she has mixed feelings. And just for context, Bio Mom is pregnant again with new guy and has been clean for a year, but we all know she could slip again too easily.

I will admit I was quite hurt when I found out she was considering letting her be there. The way I see it, she abandoned her yet again, almost zero contact or anything through the years so why should she share ANY of the happiness and glory that comes from MY DAUGHTER graduating?  I know my daughter is 18 now and I can't do anything if she decides to have a relationship with Bio mom, but it still hurts none the less.

Also, YES I know if it wasn't for Bio Mom I wouldn't have such an amazing daughter, but I also know that if I didn't step up that my daughter wouldn't have had a stable mother in her life.  Bio mom caused a lot of trauma for that young lady that i had to help her work through. I put her in therapy, took her to the doctors, helped her gain weight, I made sure I was present for ALL the big things she experienced, all the 1sts that are important for teenage girls. 1st kiss, 1st BF, 1st heartbreak ,etc. 

So AITA for not wanting her Bio Mom to be there for such an important day in my daughter's life?

I also have a french bulldog that will eat anything and everything, as much as I love him, he‚Äôs not the brightest.

Other than not leaving anything on the sofa or in his reach, the most important is to not leave anything on the table and to move the chairs away from the table when we‚Äôre not home.
Cut to a few days after her arrival, I get home and my dog looked a bit unwell, I asked Amy if she saw anything and she said he was fine when she got home. I took him out for a walk and as I was picking up his poop I saw a candy wrap in his poop. Came home and asked Amy if she left anything on the table or in his reach and she said no, that maybe he ate something off the street from the previous walk. I explained that it‚Äôs very important for me to know if he ate anything so I can take him to the vet, she adamantly said no and told me it‚Äôs my fault for not paying attention to what my dog picks up from the street.
Needless to say my dog started feeling sicker and I had to take him to the vet, where they discovered that he had around 8 or 9 candy wraps in his stomach. I came back home and confronted Amy and she finally admitted that she left a bag of candy on the table but that she pulled the chairs away so she thought he couldn‚Äôt reach them but indeed when she came back home the bag was on the floor and the candy was gone. I told her that she could have killed my dog since she didn‚Äôt come clean in the first place and I wasted precious hours instead of taking him immediately to the vet.

I also invited some friends from college. Note that there were two distinct groups of people: friends that I met in college and ones that I didn't, so they didn't know each other.

One of my friends (lets call her Annie, 20F) from college arrived late, didn't bother to meet and talk to anyone besides her close friends, and decided to leave after staying for only 20 minutes. I asked why and she said that she was going to see a cover band with the same group of friends that I met in college.

Important things to note: it was not the first time something like it happens (won't be specific) so it's not an isolated event; I invited them A WEEK before my birthday, and I only knew they were leaving because I saw them leaving and reached for them first.

I sent Annie a message and asked what the heck was going on. After a handful of messages she opens up and says she wasn't liking the party and she didn't know almost anyone (except for two friends), and decided to leave.

There was no effort from her part to stay, I wasn't informed about anything before myself asking, and above all, I didn't get an apology.

86,1cbanc8,AITA for pulling back emotionally?,"I(34M) am in a relationship with girlfriend(30F) of 6 years. She has severe health issues involving her uterus, as well as ongoing depression. A lot of this has been a thing for at least 3 or 4 years. Recently it came to a head. She's been the hospital several times recently, and I've been there with her every time, but it's been one of the worst months of her life.



She often wants to vent for like an hour or 2 when she's extremely stressed or depressed. I try to listen and be there for her but it's absolutely exhausting when it's almost daily. She'll keep repeating or rehashing the same issues. If I try to point out the upside and say things will be okay she gets annoyed and says I don't know that. If I try to provide advice she wants me to stop trying to fix things. I've tried just listening mostly quietly and she says ""Is that all you have to say?"" or that she's not feeling comforted.





I ask her what she wants me to do to comfort her and she says she doesn't know, but to do something. I try to hug her but often when she's depressed she doesn't want to be touched. She also doesn't like me looking at my phone, even though sometimes she'll be processing stress for hours, expecting me to do nothing but listen.  
She often snips at me when she's stressed, or insults me calling me an asshole or a robot(I'm autistic and don't process social cues well). She's even admitted that if I treated her half as bad as she did when she gets angry that she wouldn't be with me, but that the hormone issues and medications she's on means she cannot control her emotions.





But I'm the \*only\* one she lashes out at. I point this out and that she doesn't lash out at anyone else in her family like her mother who she vents to like 10% of the time, but she says it's not a competition. She has very few friends and only talks to them every few months so I'm like 90% of her support network.





I finally told her that I can't be her emotional dumping ground. I'm willing to listen and be there for her but not for hours on end, or tolerate being insulted. I refuse to believe that someone can't control their emotions. She's woken me up several hours before work to vent for 2 hours and then gotten snippy at me over stuff, and I told her she needs to manage her emotions better and stop unloading on me when I'm not capable. She's only \*just\* now after years looking to start therapy. She did 4 years ago but dropped it pretty quickly.





I do try to help her as much as possible, but I also tend to need a lot of alone time, though I make clear it's not because of her but just that I get overwhelmed. So I'm not as receptive as I should be, but I also pretty much never insult or lash out at her. Me being geniunely insulting is like a once a year or 2 occurrence.

89,1cbadim,AITA for leaving my husband at our lake house with his family.,"My husband and I own a lake house that we spend most of our free time at when it's warm. 

We go there over the winter to check on it and do any basic maintenance that is required. It is not set up for winter living. 

We often invite friends and family over. We have almost two acres of land and there is lots of room to park an RV or set up a tent. 

The house has a septic tank for the toilet. All the other water goes to a grey water tank we use for the garden and lawn. We only use biosafe products. We have a very well built and ventilated outhouse for when we have people over. 

So last weekend was the one where we went out to get the house ready for the spring and summer. 

We ordered the water truck to fill our tank. The propane guys to fill up that tank. We ran water through the pipes to flush them out and get them ready to use. 

And his mom and dad showed up with his brother and his family. Which would be fine except it was a cold and shitty weekend. So they didn't want to set up tents and stay outside. 

I asked him why they were here. He said that he told them we were going  out and they sort of invited themselves out. 

They didn't bring out much besides some sandwiches and a bunch of beer. They didn't understand why we didn't have any of the water toys ready. THERE WAS STILL ICE ON THE LAKE. I asked my husband to tell them that we were not ready for guests and that they needed to leave or help. He wouldn't do it. 

So I left. I said I needed to run to the store. I took my car and went to the grocery store five blocks from my house. It is an asian market with great sushi.

91,1cba5f3,WIBTA if I back out of helping my sister pay for a car because she went and got a 65k jeep instead of what we originally agreed on.,"My sister (18 f) is starting college this fall. She doesn't have a car but will need one because she'll be commuting to school while living at home.

At the beginning of the year, I (27 m) told her that I'd help her pay for a car as a graduation gift, and I'd pay for the first 5k of her monthly payments. She has an almost full-ride scholarship and is living at home, so this will probably be her only recurring bill outside of school fees and supplies. I did this so that when she started working, she could build as much of a savings net as possible if something came up.

My parents, my sister, and I originally agreed on a max of 25k-30k. This car isn't meant to last her a decade. She's never owned a car before; this is her ""baby's first car."" It's supposed to be an affordable used car for a college kid to get around in. It should last her for college, and then she can figure out what to do from there.

Well, I was lied to because she and my parents went out and bought a brand-new Jeep yesterday. I'm livid my parents co-signed for her to get this. Not only did they buy a 65k brand-new car, but they financed(!) a 10k down payment at an even higher APR for some reason! For some insight, my parents cannot afford this car themselves, and they can't even afford the new payments on the loan they got for the 10k. There's a reason I'm the one helping out with the payments on this, not them. My sister does not even have a job yet, which was supposed to be step 1 before we even got her the car.

I'm livid. The 5k I had set aside for her won't even last the summer if we put it towards the car and loan payments. The whole reason I did this is now basically moot because she'll have to cover the payments while she's in school. My parents have good credit somehow but ave 0 cash at the end of each month, so I'm pretty sure once my 5k runs dry, the car will be repoed for nonpayment in the next year or so. What boils my blood even more is they know I'm livid but don't care. Mom went on a whole hour about how sisters ""eyes lit up at the sight of the car"" and ""you would not have said no either if you were there."" We had talked about this for months. My sister and parents both know 100% that she will not be able to afford this car, but they don't care now.

I'm considering backing out. I'll tell them to return the car, and we return to the original plan, or else I'll just invest the 5k in a 5-year bond for my sister. I want some opinions on this plan,

Edit: Quick clarification.

My gift to her is a total of 5k that was to be used for monthly payments. The way I worded it was weird I think originally. I did not promise to help with a downpayment or anything else fee related. She had saving to cover that. I was going to pay the first 5k of monthly payments after that.

edit 2 and update:   
Some people are asking why the original car purchase price we decided of 25k-30k was so high. I agree, that's pretty high for an unemployed college kid. That was meant to be an ""absolute max that you need to think very carefully about"" total (fee's included.) I was encouraging them to go for 10-15k but was talked up to a 25-30k max. 

I also just got confirmation that the deal was finalized yesterday. There's no returning the jeep, I was mistake about how used vs new cars are treated with cool down period laws. She and my parents are screwed. Thanks for the advice so far, going to think this over tonight and figure out how much of his circus I want to be apart of.

95,1cb9b9g,AITA for telling my parents and sisters that talking crap about the name my brother and SIL picked for their baby and blaming SIL for it all isn't doing what they think it is?,"So my (twin) brother and his wife (SIL) had a baby boy recently and they chose the name *Everest* for their son. I knew the name prior to my nephew's birth but nobody else did and when my parents and siblings learned the name they were really not okay. At first they thought it was a joke and asked for my nephew's real name and then when my brother told them Everest was the real name, they acted like he had grown 5 heads. Shocked, horrified and angry were very clear. They didn't actually say anything else then. But that might be due to SILs family also being present.

The next time we were all together they couldn't wait to jump on my brother and SIL for giving my nephew such a ""crazy name"". My brother told them the name was the name and nothing they said would change it.

They asked SIL how she could do that to their grandson/nephew. That he didn't need to be burdened by her family's strangeness. The reason they said this is SIL and her family all have more unusual names. She told me before it goes back at least three generations (now 4) and that she always loved her name and the names in her family and she always gravitated to those kinds of names. I know my brother always liked names that were different too and we're alike in that way (maybe it's a twin thing lol).

My brother made the rest of our family leave. They expected me to go with them but I stayed. This shocked them more.

Apparently they have annoyed the crap out of my brother in the last few weeks and he decided to block them for a while. SIL also blocked them because she was getting a lot of harassment from them and it's very clear they blame her alone for the name.

The rest of the family asked me to join them for a dinner and this dinner was about how crazy my brother is for allowing this and how SIL is awful for doing this to my nephew. They mentioned how they sent several messages to both about the name being downright cruel.

I chimed in and said talking crap about the name and blaming SIL for the name isn't doing what they think it is and in actual fact they won't have a grandson or nephew if they don't learn to keep their opinions to themselves AND apologize for being so cruel to SIL. They told me I should be on their side and imagine if we get a little Pixie or Fairy next or what if we get a Wave or something dumb like that. Because knowing SILs family it's likely. They told me I wasn't thinking of my nephew at all.

I chose option 2, lost a lot of weight (over 30kg).  It broke me, it devastated me.  But ultimately, she was right.  It wasn't healthy and it wasn't attractive, I've always maintained that while the message was right the delivery left a lot to be desired.

Recently, my wife has gained quite a bit of weight.  To be clear, I like it.  It doesn't put me off sex, she's still just as beautiful as always, just differently beautiful.

The other night she said 'I've gained loads of weight'.  I agreed, because, well, she has.  I did iterate that she was still beautiful and it happens, especially with the change of pace she has had etc.  She blew up and insisted I should've 'lied'.

*for some context this is her first romantic relationship*

Ben is a wonderful guy. He treats Sadie very well and they are extremely compatible. Since they've been together both of them have expressed wanting to break up with each other at some point. The first time was a couple months into them dating - Ben felt Sadie was a little immature with finances and had to fix some underlying issues with her family. He said he wanted to see other people for awhile. After a couple days apart he essentially begged her to get back together with him. They were mostly fine after that.

Fast forward to about a year later, Sadie and I are getting coffee and she tells me she wants to break up with Ben. She said they don't have a foundation in faith like she wants and he is not willing to pursue faith any further and that's that. Ben has also has never met her parents (still to this day) so she felt/feels uncomfortable about that. Sadie said she felt like she was wasting her time and that he couldn't get her what she was looking for.

They ended up breaking up...for about 5 hours. Sadie broke it off and was devastated. She called me saying she was willing to forgo all the family issues and his lack of a relationship with God if it meant getting to be with him. 

Now they are back together. They were going to move in together in the fall but Ben was saying he may move in now in July. Sadie told me she didn't feel comfortable with that plan because she's worried he won't want to get married later on. They ended up talking and he explained why they need to move in together, and how she's basically going along with it.

Like I said, Ben is a great guy and treats her very well. But with the history they have had I'm very worried that something is going to go wrong. I texted her and said ""from an outsiders perspective, it seems like you are being very complacent and doing whatever Ben wants and your wants/concerns are being swept under the rug.""

101,1cb8n6q,"AITA for offering to loan my sister ¬£11,000 to completely wipe away her debt?","I (27f) have always tried to do right by my family. If they need a dog and/or babysitter, I'm there. If they need someone to vent to or confide in, I'm there. If they need to borrow some cash, I'm there. Anyone in the family who has owed me money (Which has only been either my mom or brother) in the past has paid me back in full, and without any grief. I have always been happy to lend them a helping hand.

Well, this time didn't go so well. My sister (28) is not much closer to paying off her debt then when she started a few years ago. She owes ¬£11,000, which is about $13,700. So, it's pretty bad. She pays ¬£400 a month which only covers a little bit extra than the interest rate alone. I'm not sure how long it'll take her to pay that off.

The only source of income I recieve is benefits due to my health condition. The only reason I have as much money as I do is because I recently received compensation for damages. In fact, what I recieved was just enough to cover my sisters debt. I don't see myself needing that kind of money anytime soon, so I thought I'd help my sister.

I offered to pay off her debt as long as she gave me the ¬£400 she usually pays per month. So her debt would go to me, but I would be more lenient when need be. If everything went smoothly, it would take just over 2 years to pay me back, and I was fine with that. The only other conditions I laid out was that I be assured that her impulse buyimg days were over, and she close her credit accounts as soon as everything was paid off. She said ""No, thank you,"" and I respected her decision and didn't bring it up to her again.

The next day our dad dropped by her house to get something, and she was being all pissy. He asked her what was wrong, and she was mad at me and said I was ""babying"" her.

My friend ""Sarah"" came over last night to hang out and she said something about my sister and I told her what happened and I also told her that I was pretty hurt over the ""babying"" comment. Right away she agreed with my sister. She said I was in fact ""babying"" her and it was ""condescending"" of me for basically saying she can't take care of herself and also I was being ""controlling"" for wanting her to close her accounts if she accepted my offer. I tried explaining my side more clearly, but she kept interrupting me and she raised her voice until she was almost yelling at me. Sarah said that I should trust my family and give her the benefit of the doubt, and if I didn't trust her then that was my problem and I should think about why. I said to her that ¬£11,000 was a lot for the ""benefit of the doubt"". Especially when that's almost everything I have. I love my sister, but that just seemed like such a crazy thing to say. Sarah then called me a dick for wanting ¬£400 a month even after I told her that that's what she's paying now. It's not like my sister is starving. Money is a little tight but it's certainly doable.

Well, this time didn't go so well. My sister (28) is not much closer to paying off her debt then when she started a few years ago. She owes ¬£11,000, which is about $13,700. So, it's pretty bad. She pays ¬£400 a month which only covers a little bit extra than the interest rate alone. I'm not sure how long it'll take her to pay that off.

The only source of income I recieve is benefits due to my health condition. The only reason I have as much money as I do is because I recently received compensation for damages. In fact, what I recieved was just enough to cover my sisters debt. I don't see myself needing that kind of money anytime soon, so I thought I'd help my sister.

I offered to pay off her debt as long as she gave me the ¬£400 she usually pays per month. So her debt would go to me, but I would be more lenient when need be. If everything went smoothly, it would take just over 2 years to pay me back, and I was fine with that. The only other conditions I laid out was that I be assured that her impulse buyimg days were over, and she close her credit accounts as soon as everything was paid off. She said ""No, thank you,"" and I respected her decision and didn't bring it up to her again.

The next day our dad dropped by her house to get something, and she was being all pissy. He asked her what was wrong, and she was mad at me and said I was ""babying"" her.

My friend ""Sarah"" came over last night to hang out and she said something about my sister and I told her what happened and I also told her that I was pretty hurt over the ""babying"" comment. Right away she agreed with my sister. She said I was in fact ""babying"" her and it was ""condescending"" of me for basically saying she can't take care of herself and also I was being ""controlling"" for wanting her to close her accounts if she accepted my offer. I tried explaining my side more clearly, but she kept interrupting me and she raised her voice until she was almost yelling at me. Sarah said that I should trust my family and give her the benefit of the doubt, and if I didn't trust her then that was my problem and I should think about why. I said to her that ¬£11,000 was a lot for the ""benefit of the doubt"". Especially when that's almost everything I have. I love my sister, but that just seemed like such a crazy thing to say. Sarah then called me a dick for wanting ¬£400 a month even after I told her that that's what she's paying now. It's not like my sister is starving. Money is a little tight but it's certainly doable.

102,1cb8jbt,AITA for not giving my plus size friend the queen size bed in our b&b?,"I (30‚Äôs F) am going on vacation with 4 of my friends (30‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs Fs). We go every year, and always use a randomized selection tool to help us choose who gets which bedroom. The tool assigns the order in which we can choose. I got 3rd choice, and my plus size friend (Marie) got 5th choice. 

The first 3 of us all chose the queen size beds. The other two got twin beds and had to share a room. Yeah, it sucks, but that‚Äôs why we leave it up to chance so nobody can complain. 

Marie asked me privately if we could switch places so she can have the queen size bed. She is plus size, but imo not so big she can‚Äôt fit in a twin bed. I personally have lost over 100 lbs and at my largest, was bigger than Marie is now.  I never once asked to switch beds when I was bigger. 

I therefore said no. She started crying and told me I was being unreasonable, and that i of all people should understand. I do understand, but it‚Äôs my vacation too and I‚Äôve worked hard to be in a body I‚Äôm comfortable in. I don‚Äôt feel like I should give up my spot to accommodate her, when she can still fit in the twin bed. 

AITA?


Edit: we agreed ahead of time that the two people who got the twin beds would pay $75 less than the rest of us. It‚Äôs just way too expensive to get a place with 5 rooms and 5 queen beds. 

Edit 2: she doesn‚Äôt have any mobility issues or other disabilities that I‚Äôm aware of.

Edit 3: it‚Äôs $75 off of a total of $400 for the whole trip 

Edit 4: She never explicitly offered the $75 back to me, but I honestly can‚Äôt imagine she didn‚Äôt have that in mind when asking to switch. She‚Äôs not the monster a lot of you are assuming she is.


Edit 5: thank you all for your comments. Many people suggested it might be more about her discomfort about sharing a room, and not as much about out the bed. That would make way more sense to me. When I was bigger, I used to snore and was completely embarrassed when I had to sleep in a room with someone. 

Many also suggested I am lacking empathy. It is true, I do not feel empathy. It is a long standing  issue with my mental health, and is why I often post on this account asking for help. I don‚Äôt want to be a dick, so I rely on honest people to call me out. So I do appreciate it, even though many people who said these things were downvoted.

Anyway, about six years ago I developed chronic pain in my coccyx (tailbone). All doctors agree: there is nothing that can be done. After all the injections, creams, and physical therapy in the world, I have found that something that helps me is sitting on a circular cushion designed for people with this pain. It's a small, black oval that I carry with me everywhere.

&#x200B;

My mother has grown increasingly strange about the cushion. Whenever I see her, she'll make some snide comment of ""still need the cushion?"" Or, if I sit next to her someplace, she'll say things like ""how are you going to live if you can't sit comfortably?"" I remind her that the other option is, well, not living, but it never seems to bother her.

&#x200B;

This all came to a head recently. She picked me up from the train station, and I was making conversation about the play I saw (we both like plays, so I thought she would be interested). People at this play refused to sit down when it was supposed to start, and the ushers were not having it. The show started twenty minutes late , and by then the ushers were literally screaming at the patrons to sit down. I have been to a ton of plays, but I've never seen anything like this.

&#x200B;

When I finished this, she unloaded on me. She said that these people weren't sitting down because I need the cushion to sit on, and that it was so incredibly rude of me to still use it since I blocked their view. I was shocked. The people who were standing were all in front of me (everyone behind me was sitting down happily). Also, my cushion collapses when I sit on it, I slouch when I sit to make up for it, and I am not the tallest person in the world, so while I suppose I do sit an inch or so higher than I would without the cushion,  I'm certainly not the tallest person in the theater.

&#x200B;

What really got me, of course, was that she wasn't at the theater. She had no idea why people were refusing to sit down, if my cushion was too high, or whatever. It was clear that she had been thinking about this for a while and just exploded.

108,1cb6jwv,AITA for disinviting my mom from an event bc she read my journal,"im new to Reddit so please bare with me.

My mom and I (19), have been beefing for the last couple of months since I broke up with my ex bf of 5 years. She was very attached to him and saw him as a son. Well me being single, I started going out with friends to hang out and party.

My mom has always been strict, which results in me being a very sneaky child who lies about a lot of things out of fear of judgement or her telling me no.

Thought I‚Äôd provide some context so here‚Äôs the story. 
 
I went to a party a couple days ago and when  I got home the next morning, my mom came up to me and asked why I was upset. I was upset because she had been non stop calling me while I was at the party. I ignored her and she said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you ask me why I‚Äôm upset‚Äù I continued to ignore her. She then said 
‚ÄúI know something happened at that party(different party I went to where I smoked/drank) and 
‚Äúare you sure you didn‚Äôt leave willem (my ex) for someone else?‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt leave my ex for someone else, he‚Äôs just someone I journaled about a few months after the breakup, she didn‚Äôt know about him)

I was confused as to how she knew all of this because I hadn‚Äôt told anyone. I then got to thinking maybe she saw something on my phone? And then it clicked, she probably read my journal the night I was at the party. 

 I proceeded to ask my brother if he knew anything about it and he was hesitant but finally told me what happened. 

My mom read my journal, that contained very very personal feelings and events that had occurred in my life. 

As my brother told me more, I was in shock because how could you read something so personal about someone out of pure nosiness?? 

I proceeded to walk upstairs where my mom and dad were talking and I yelled,‚Äù you read my fucking journal?‚Äù Her response: trying to look confused and responding with ‚Äúit just fell onto the floor and I saw what it said‚Äù (this journal was on a book shelf tucked between books, it didn‚Äôt just fall out)

I continued yelling at her saying how messed up it was. I‚Äôll summarize some things I said
- I would‚Äôve told you everything that fucking journal said if I felt like I could but I can‚Äôt talk to you.
- I‚Äôm fucking moving out, I‚Äôm done.
- why the fuck would you do that?
And lastly,

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come to my fucking event tomorrow‚Äù 
this event is for school, it‚Äôs a baking showcase of things I‚Äôve been prepping for a few weeks now. I invited friends and family and it basically just to show everything I‚Äôve learned in school (I‚Äôm graduating with my associates in culinary arts)

I left shortly after I said that and went to my brothers house. Showed back up to my house a few hours later with boxes ready to pack my stuff. As I was leaving my dad said ‚Äú I know this is devastating but you should reconsider disinviting your mom, she‚Äôs going to be devastated for the rest of her life if she doesn‚Äôt go to your event tomorrow‚Äù

So Reddit, AITA for disinviting my mom from my event because she read my journal?

My mom and I (19), have been beefing for the last couple of months since I broke up with my ex bf of 5 years. She was very attached to him and saw him as a son. Well me being single, I started going out with friends to hang out and party.

My mom has always been strict, which results in me being a very sneaky child who lies about a lot of things out of fear of judgement or her telling me no.

Thought I‚Äôd provide some context so here‚Äôs the story. 
 
I went to a party a couple days ago and when  I got home the next morning, my mom came up to me and asked why I was upset. I was upset because she had been non stop calling me while I was at the party. I ignored her and she said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you ask me why I‚Äôm upset‚Äù I continued to ignore her. She then said 
‚ÄúI know something happened at that party(different party I went to where I smoked/drank) and 
‚Äúare you sure you didn‚Äôt leave willem (my ex) for someone else?‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt leave my ex for someone else, he‚Äôs just someone I journaled about a few months after the breakup, she didn‚Äôt know about him)

I was confused as to how she knew all of this because I hadn‚Äôt told anyone. I then got to thinking maybe she saw something on my phone? And then it clicked, she probably read my journal the night I was at the party. 

 I proceeded to ask my brother if he knew anything about it and he was hesitant but finally told me what happened. 

My mom read my journal, that contained very very personal feelings and events that had occurred in my life. 

As my brother told me more, I was in shock because how could you read something so personal about someone out of pure nosiness?? 

I proceeded to walk upstairs where my mom and dad were talking and I yelled,‚Äù you read my fucking journal?‚Äù Her response: trying to look confused and responding with ‚Äúit just fell onto the floor and I saw what it said‚Äù (this journal was on a book shelf tucked between books, it didn‚Äôt just fall out)

I continued yelling at her saying how messed up it was. I‚Äôll summarize some things I said
- I would‚Äôve told you everything that fucking journal said if I felt like I could but I can‚Äôt talk to you.
- I‚Äôm fucking moving out, I‚Äôm done.
- why the fuck would you do that?
And lastly,

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come to my fucking event tomorrow‚Äù 
this event is for school, it‚Äôs a baking showcase of things I‚Äôve been prepping for a few weeks now. I invited friends and family and it basically just to show everything I‚Äôve learned in school (I‚Äôm graduating with my associates in culinary arts)

I left shortly after I said that and went to my brothers house. Showed back up to my house a few hours later with boxes ready to pack my stuff. As I was leaving my dad said ‚Äú I know this is devastating but you should reconsider disinviting your mom, she‚Äôs going to be devastated for the rest of her life if she doesn‚Äôt go to your event tomorrow‚Äù

109,1cb6iaw,AITA for referring to my brother‚Äôs ex as our baby sister?,"One of my dad‚Äôs best friends died when his daughter, Amelia, was 3 so my dad stepped up and has been playing a fatherly role to her ever since. My brother started dating Amelia 4 years ago which was super weird at first. They broke up 5 months ago and so Amelia isn‚Äôt around as much as she used to be which is sad.

My brother is seeing someone else and I was telling her a story which included Amelia. I clarified Amelia was our baby sister because that‚Äôs how we refer to her all of the time and his girlfriend said she thought Amelia was my brother‚Äôs ex so I confirmed she is. His girlfriend made a weird face but didn‚Äôt say anything else about it. A few of his friends were there too but they all know Amelia and our dynamic so none of them said anything, except for my brother who told me not to call her that and said she wasn‚Äôt actually family which upset me because she absolutely is.

He was annoyed already but things got worse because his best friend made a joke about how Amelia was a hot little thing so he wouldn‚Äôt have considered her as a baby sister either which made my brother angry and he told him not to talk about Amelia like that, which caused his friends to make fun of him for the big brother act.

After everyone left my brother told me Amelia was never our sister and I should stop pretending she is. I told him to fuck off because he doesn‚Äôt get to ruin my relationship with her because he was a shitty fianc√©. My sister also agrees with me but my dad, of all people, thinks I should‚Äôve left it alone.

110,1cb6dts,WIBTA if I made my mom get back something she gave away 6 years ago?,"My (29M) father died from brain cancer 9 years ago. I was just finishing college. It obviously left me with serious emotional scars. My father and I had fought a lot as I was growing up and our relationship was just starting to get better.

Once he died, I kept two rings of his. I wore them everyday. But in 2017 I was approved on a Master's degree abroad. I decided to leave them at my mom's house, where I lived, because I was afraid of losing them. They were inside a box in my room.

When I was out, my mom moved the rings for ""safekeeping"". She then ended up gifting one of them to my cousin, who was close to my dad. When I got back, about a year later, I asked for the rings. Only one of them was there. I asked about the other one, described it to her, she didn't remember what happened to the ring.

She saw my cousin recently and that made her remember what she did. She told me about it. I'm really mad, that wasn't hers to give and now I feel like it's been too long to get it back.

WIBTA if I told my mom she needs to get it back? There's other jewelry that belonged to my dad she could swap it for, but I don't know, it feels... weird. My cousin wears it daily, he was close to my dad too, it would feel wrong taking that from him. But it also feels wrong not to have it.



UPDATE: I messaged him about it, explaining what happened and asking if he'd be willing to exchange it for something else. I also told him it'll be totally alright if he doesn't want to, I understand it has sentimental value to him too and I won't bear any resentment if it's something he wants to keep.

According to him, my mom never gave him anything. He wears a ring, but it's one he bought when he was travelling.

Hey guys, last Sunday my cousin (female 23) and me (female 24) were sitting in a caf√© to celebrate a friend's birthday. 

My cousin joined us a bit later but when she arrived the waitress asked us whether we'd like to order anything else so she ordered water and I ordered an espresso. A few minutes later, they brought her a bottle of water (0.25ml) and I received my espresso but it was served with an empty glass.

When I tried to mention that the bottle might have been meant for the both of us she got entirely defensive and insisted that she ordered the water and that it was solely meant for her.

It makes me look selfish that it seems like I just agreed to it initially to seek her help, whereas now that I don‚Äôt need her help anymore, I‚Äôm being honest.

It‚Äôs just sharing my pictures with her, but the thought of the possibility that she might casually try to set me up with someone using those pictures is unsettling to me.

120,1cb59cj,AITA for spending a long time in a public toilet? ,"TMI warning

I'm on day 2 of my period and had severe stomach pains while at college today. I chose to go to a toilet at the end of college because you are in a small room that has a lot more privacy rather than the toilet stalls. 

I knew that I would need privacy because I knew there would be quite a lot of poo and blood and if I got blood on my hands I would want a sink right next to me rather than people seeing me go outside. I also wanted a room so people couldn't hear me.

Turns out my period problems have been getting a lot worse, when I pooped my body had to push out more to the point where I probably lost 1kg, there was non period blood, I thought I was going to be physically sick and had to go home from the pain.

Now here's the issue, I had someone continuously trying to open the door, at one point knocking and also called someone (staff) to tell me to hurry up. I think I was in there for about 20 minutes.

Normally I wouldn't really be annoyed at this but I could hear them saying rude stuff to their friends about ""whoever was in there"". When they knocked I was going to answer with ""sorry I will be a while"" but as soon as they knocked they all started laughing loudly. 

When I came out I went past them and I heard her go ""finally"", and decided to basically let me frustrations out a bit. I told her if she can not be rude when people are trying to use the bathroom because I want to use it peacefully without hearing all of that stuff and I had been having stomach issues. 

She said and kept saying ""well you were taking a while"".

She said that to everything. I made it clear I was having stomach problems and that she could've just used the toilet that was literally in the room next door (that is probably the same distance). 

So AITA for spending a lot of time? I couldn't have been any quicker but I could be the A for having a go at them as well

His parents will come to stay with us at our apt for a few days, and then the four of us are going to drive down to a timeshare in SC for a week before they drive us back up to our apartment in NYC. I was grateful for the invitation his parents made, but I had also planned a trip to Puerto Rico as his grad present since my mom has a house down there she said we could stay at (we will have the house to ourselves). Our intimacy has suffered a lot since he's been focusing on his studies, and I was really looking forward to going to the beach, exploring, spending time together, etc. It's tough for him to take lots of vacation time, so I figured it would be nice to split our time evenly(ish) on this trip. I told him we could spend nine days with his family, and then fly to PR and spend four days just him and me.

Now it turns out his brother, SIL, and 2.5yo nephew are also coming on the trip. I told him I understood because his family is very important to him, but I didn't want to take my first vacation in a year with a whole family and a child. Also, the last time we were all together (brother, child and SIL included) was Thanksgiving, and my bf kind of just tucked away by himself and read, napped, etc and left me alone with his family because he says he was ""decompressing"" and because he thinks I can hold my own (which I can). But he didn't really hang out with anybody, or me for that matter, until dinner time.

I attend therapy when I need to and I have a psychiatrist who helps with medications and any other treatments that might be needed.

I was always pretty open with my mom and she was always good with not telling people stuff that I wanted time with or wanted to keep between us. Except when she remarried. I was 11 when she remarried and she hid nothing from her husband. This was something I didn't really like and when I talked to mom about it she told me that's just how it was going to be, because keeping stuff from your spouse is the way to ruin your marriage. She told me I never would have minded dad knowing and I told her it was because he was my dad, but Frank (her husband) isn't and I don't want him to know everything about me.

She told me I could tell her and I should trust her enough to tell her anything important going on. I said telling her means telling Frank and I didn't want that. She asked me why it was such a big deal and I told her because Frank isn't as important to me as he is to her and he's not my dad or a stand in for him.

I ended up talking to my grandparents about the thing going on because my therapist suggested I have someone else to talk to. They're the people I trust most now for this kind of thing.

E had to go to all her classes that week in order to go to my party, but decided to miss 2 classes in order to go have sex with her boyfriend D, she told one of our friends about it. The following day after my birthday two of my friends came over N who I already mentioned and C (female 16). C told me how she had talked to E the day prior and how she ditched her last classes to go with D. When i asked E if she would make it to the party she said she has to do chores and random requests her parents asked of her, an hour later I called and asked if she would be making it, she said she couldn't. 
Still haven't told her I know because unlike her I don't go and talk shit about friends. Anyways there's been a couple incidents that have been really bugging me, and idk how to handle them.

125,1cb3fzh,AITA for being mad my (F31) fiance (M31) secretly spent our small travel fund?,"UPDATE: First of all, thank you all for the comments and the valuable insights. I tried to respond to everyone's questions and advice but it became impossible, what with hundreds of comments flooding in which is not something I expected so yes, thank you!

I'm not sure this is how you do an update so I hope everyone who was interested in the update will be able to see this!

First, let me address one thing that I now realize I'd left unclear in my OG post: The fiance did not REFUSE to say where he spent the money. I was the one that clammed him up by impulsively saying I didn't care (I was so upset I couldn't even be in the same room, let alone listen to what he had to say and that's on me).

Secondly, a lot of you suggested he may be gambling or cheating - he is doing neither, thank goodness LOL I can vouch for that.

Now, update!! I got up this morning and woke him up saying I wanted to re-address the money thing. He immediately got up and we started to talk. I told him that I wanted my share back as soon as possible, within this week preferably. I didn't care how he would get the money back and I told him he was free to sell the comics if he needed to. Now, onto the COMICS. He didn't lie about the price. He showed me the receipt and yes, it did cost as much as he had told me it cost. I just wanted to clear that up too now that I also have proof.

Anyway, I asked him about where the money went and here is what he said, (and provided texts for me to see): He started off with an apology and said he'd give me the money back. He re-stated the gift thing. He ordered it in back in February and, as per the shop site, didn't expect it before the end of March (it may sound strange to people from normal countries, but I've waited for my packages for up to 2 months sometimes). He expected he'd get his salary right on time to pay for the comic but this didn't happen as his pay ran two days late (which it was, I remember) and the package arrived on time, so he (in his own words) carelessly took the money with the intention of returning it. I asked why he didn't return it, he apologized and said he wanted to but that wasn't enough for me. The rest of the money went to pay a bill from the apartment he rented prior to us moving together. Long story short, THAT SAME BUDDY I MENTIONED had moved into that apartment when my fiance moved out (and he and I moved in) and the buddy stayed for like a month and left without paying that month's utilities. Instead of calling the police, the owner of that previous flat called my fiance. Since he knew his buddy couldn't pay for the damn bill, he ended up paying it so she didn't call the police on the buddy. I saw the text message exchange. When asked why he didn't tell me, he said he knew I'd be very upset but that he felt it was the right thing to do (to pay for the bill) and that he now realizes just how stupid he was. Kept on apologizing and for calling me an ass for being mad.

I told him my trust is very hard to be earned back and that, should we stay together, I will not be interested in mutual savings or anything similar to that. I gave him a two week deadline to give me my money back and he said he'd give it back sooner than that. I told him I will save on my own and that he's free to do what he wants with his money. He asked me if I could reconsider and start a travel fund again (this time, using a proper bank account, etc.) but I refused and will not entertain the idea.

We have decided to stay together but I am super cautious about going forward. I have suggested couple counseling so we can figure out why in the WORLD he does such mindless things without asking me or even trusting me and he has agreed to the idea, so we will see. There's a lot to (re)build but at least now I know what actually transpired. Still mad at him but yes. Thank you!!

EDIT: Wow I...didn't expect this kind of response and I'm not sure how edits work here and if any one of you who have given me advice will see the edit. Thank you, first of all, for helping me go forward. I will have another serious discussion with Jack and see where the rest of the money went because its not like he flatly rejected telling me, its that i was so mad I just told him I didn't care about any of his excuses so...Hopefully I shall resolve this mystery soon. I will update properly tomorrow so if anyone wants to read more about my drama, feel free to check back tomorrow at this time haha üòÖ

Hello! Long time lurker/commenter in need of judgement.

A few months ago my fiance whom I will call Jack and I decided to start a small travel fund. I told Jack that, when I was in my 20s, I used to save money for trips and that I never used my travel fund for anything else (like being tempted to grab some cash from it when I really needed it). It helped me save plenty without burning a hole in my pocket once I was on the road and he liked the idea. I made it explicitly clear that this was super important to me because we don't have super high earnings and anything we can save for the fund would be lovely since we were planning to travel to Italy this year.

For 3-4 months we both contributed to the fund and we saved up enough to cover accommodation expenses which made me excited.

A few days ago, I was cleaning up and something made me look into our fund. Now, the fund is an envelope (I know, I know) and I opened it just to remind myself how much we saved, only to see the fund was empty. The money was gone.

When Jack came back from the store, I asked him where the money was and he said he spent a half of it on a gift he recently bought me (it was a hardcover comic book I knew was pricey and was very happy and grateful when I received it). Jack wouldn't say where the other half was. I was livid. Not because he spent the money (though that also upsets me) but because he spent it without telling me.

His excuse is he didn't take me seriously when I said this was important to me. Jack said he would put the money back and that he was sorry and that he didn't think it was going to be such a big deal. I told him I didn't trust him anymore and that the fact he used the money I contributed to either buy my own gift or to spend it on god knows what was a severe violation of trust from my pov.

Jack said I was being an asshole about it and we're still just as upset at each other.

Was I really TA? I'm sorry if this text is confusing, I'll answer questions or make edits if something is unclear. :(",Not the A-hole,2024-04-23,"AITA for being mad my (F31) fiance (M31) secretly spent our small travel fund?

Now, onto the COMICS. He didn't lie about the price. He showed me the receipt and yes, it did cost as much as he had told me it cost. I just wanted to clear that up too now that I also have proof.

Anyway, I asked him about where the money went and here is what he said, (and provided texts for me to see): He started off with an apology and said he'd give me the money back. He re-stated the gift thing. He ordered it in back in February and, as per the shop site, didn't expect it before the end of March (it may sound strange to people from normal countries, but I've waited for my packages for up to 2 months sometimes). He expected he'd get his salary right on time to pay for the comic but this didn't happen as his pay ran two days late (which it was, I remember) and the package arrived on time, so he (in his own words) carelessly took the money with the intention of returning it. I asked why he didn't return it, he apologized and said he wanted to but that wasn't enough for me. The rest of the money went to pay a bill from the apartment he rented prior to us moving together. Long story short, THAT SAME BUDDY I MENTIONED had moved into that apartment when my fiance moved out (and he and I moved in) and the buddy stayed for like a month and left without paying that month's utilities. Instead of calling the police, the owner of that previous flat called my fiance. Since he knew his buddy couldn't pay for the damn bill, he ended up paying it so she didn't call the police on the buddy. I saw the text message exchange. When asked why he didn't tell me, he said he knew I'd be very upset but that he felt it was the right thing to do (to pay for the bill) and that he now realizes just how stupid he was. Kept on apologizing and for calling me an ass for being mad.

I told him my trust is very hard to be earned back and that, should we stay together, I will not be interested in mutual savings or anything similar to that. I gave him a two week deadline to give me my money back and he said he'd give it back sooner than that. I told him I will save on my own and that he's free to do what he wants with his money. He asked me if I could reconsider and start a travel fund again (this time, using a proper bank account, etc.) but I refused and will not entertain the idea.

We have decided to stay together but I am super cautious about going forward. I have suggested couple counseling so we can figure out why in the WORLD he does such mindless things without asking me or even trusting me and he has agreed to the idea, so we will see. There's a lot to (re)build but at least now I know what actually transpired. Still mad at him but yes. Thank you!!

EDIT: Wow I...didn't expect this kind of response and I'm not sure how edits work here and if any one of you who have given me advice will see the edit. Thank you, first of all, for helping me go forward. I will have another serious discussion with Jack and see where the rest of the money went because its not like he flatly rejected telling me, its that i was so mad I just told him I didn't care about any of his excuses so...Hopefully I shall resolve this mystery soon. I will update properly tomorrow so if anyone wants to read more about my drama, feel free to check back tomorrow at this time haha üòÖ

Hello! Long time lurker/commenter in need of judgement.

A few months ago my fiance whom I will call Jack and I decided to start a small travel fund. I told Jack that, when I was in my 20s, I used to save money for trips and that I never used my travel fund for anything else (like being tempted to grab some cash from it when I really needed it). It helped me save plenty without burning a hole in my pocket once I was on the road and he liked the idea. I made it explicitly clear that this was super important to me because we don't have super high earnings and anything we can save for the fund would be lovely since we were planning to travel to Italy this year.

For 3-4 months we both contributed to the fund and we saved up enough to cover accommodation expenses which made me excited.

A few days ago, I was cleaning up and something made me look into our fund. Now, the fund is an envelope (I know, I know) and I opened it just to remind myself how much we saved, only to see the fund was empty. The money was gone.

When Jack came back from the store, I asked him where the money was and he said he spent a half of it on a gift he recently bought me (it was a hardcover comic book I knew was pricey and was very happy and grateful when I received it). Jack wouldn't say where the other half was. I was livid. Not because he spent the money (though that also upsets me) but because he spent it without telling me.

His excuse is he didn't take me seriously when I said this was important to me. Jack said he would put the money back and that he was sorry and that he didn't think it was going to be such a big deal. I told him I didn't trust him anymore and that the fact he used the money I contributed to either buy my own gift or to spend it on god knows what was a severe violation of trust from my pov.

Jack said I was being an asshole about it and we're still just as upset at each other.

Was I really TA? I'm sorry if this text is confusing, I'll answer questions or make edits if something is unclear. :(",0.0,0.07380951941013336,0,1
126,1cb3enh,AITA for refusing to see my husband on his birthday?,"It‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs birthday next week. A few days after his sisters. His sister messaged me asking if I had any plans for him this weekend and whether we would like to come and see her and have a ‚Äújoint birthday get together‚Äù (she lives 5 hours away, round trip). I said sure that sounds great, and that I had no plans for him this weekend, but I am doing something special on his actual birthday. I do have something on with my friends on Saturday morning, but this is literally 1 hour and did not impact us potentially seeing his sister at all (this is relevant later).

I spoke to my husband about this, and he said he wanted to do something, just him and I, for his birthday e.g. dinner, spend the day together etc. And we also needed to save for many upcoming expenses (vacation soon, and moving house), and going down to see her would be expensive in fuel, gifts, having to pay for her dinner (she doesn‚Äôt pay for anything), etc. I told him I already told her we were free, so he said he would call her and handle it, and make up an excuse that he was seeing his own friends this weekend and couldn‚Äôt make it. I agreed to this.

He called her, and then after the call he told me, he had actually told her he was free this weekend, but he told her I was not. And that I was actually going to see my friends. He said his sister was surprised and said ‚Äúbut OP didn‚Äôt mention she was busy?‚Äù. This has put me in such an awkward position. His sister told him it doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm busy, and for him to come and see her anyway. I asked him why he changed the whole story and pretty much threw me under the bus? He said he felt sorry for her on the phone and didn‚Äôt want her to spend her birthday without him, despite telling me a whole different story, just an hour ago. And that it was fine if he changed his mind (I do recognise it‚Äôs okay for him to change his mind and actually decide to see her).

I feel massively betrayed, it‚Äôs like he told me one thing and her, another. I told her I was free on the weekend, and he said I‚Äôm busy with friends, making me look like a liar. He said we weren‚Äôt going to see her as we were saving up, but then totally flipped on the phone. He called me selfish and cold and two-faced, saying I‚Äôm fake to his sister and asking why I have a problem with him seeing her. But the problem is really how he handled all of this and he has pretty much stopped me from going too, by telling her I‚Äôm busy. I told him I refuse to plan anything for his birthday now, I‚Äôm just so hurt and feel betrayed. I told him I don‚Äôt want to see him this weekend, so all the plans are out the window.

127,1cb2l0g,AITAH for not wanting to do more chores?,"Throwaway as neither of us wants us use our main for this dispute. Both of us will be reading the responses.

I (F27) live with my bf (M27). We were classmates at uni, both have the same degree and work in the same field (IT). We earn similar salaries (mine is bigger by 300‚Ç¨/month), split rent and utilities 50/50 and groceries 40/60 as he eats much more than I do.  

I never returned to the office after lockdown and wfh while bf works from office by choice. He had a hard time when he was wfh because he is very social and likes chatting with people while I prefer to concentrate and work in complete silence so that I can be done with work earlier (neither of us has fixed hours).  

Our day looks somewhat like this: we wake up at ~7. I grab a coffee and head straight to the computer, concentrate hard and work without distractions. By 12-1 I'm usually done with work and am semi free (I don't leave home and have notifications on my phone in case someone needs me because most of my coworkers start work much later than I do).  

Bf wakes up at the same time, heads to the shower, eats breakfast and goes to work by public transit, which takes him 40-50min one way. He starts work at ~9.30 and comes home no earlier than 19 (more like 20.30 on the days he goes to gym). Eats, packs his lunch, washes his dishes and goes to bed soon after.  

Now, chores. I cook lunch and dinner (different meals) every day. Bf has severe allergies and doesn't eat non home made food. I also do all grocery shopping and planning, laundry and do small jobs here and there (like cleaning the counters or dusting). Bf is responsible for weekly vacuuming, moping, changing sheets, deep cleaning bathroom, deep cleaning the kitchen. I spend 1.5-2h doing chores everyday while bf opts to do all his share on a saturday or sunday. It takes the better part of his day, which he is currently complaining about.  

He wants me to help with his chores so that he could be done with it earlier. He feels it's unfair I get so much free time while he barely has time to scroll his phone or read a book in the evening. I think it's his choice to work from office and I'm not responsible for it. He would save at least 1.5h daily on commute alone. He pointed out he was depressed when he had to wfh, which, again I don't think has anything to do with me or my free time.  

Basically he thinks I'm being selfish by not wanting to help him out. Being together means helping each other according to him. I asked how is it that he helps me then. I previously lived alone and it was cheaper (didn't have to spend so much on groceries because I don't have dietary restrictions and am a tiny person who doesn't eat much). I don't want to spend more time on chores than I used to when I was alone on top of that. All so that he could have it easier than he would if he was living alone. I have the time and could easily help him with chores, but frankly I'd much rather read a book or go for a walk instead. AITA?

The suitcase is a large unwieldy shape and heavy too, airport staff put warning stickers on it. On top of that, as it provides such generous storage space it encourages overpacking, meaning us lugging around gear that is rarely if ever taken out of the suitcase at stops.

I just said if she doesn't want to pay towards it then I don't want her having any more of it since I'm having to buy it more regularly if she's going to keep eating it. She said I was being selfish and unfair but I just pointed out she just expects to be given the food for free.

  
  
I said I'm happy to share it as long as she starts paying towards it but she just accused me of making it all about money. I just repeated that if she's not paying for any of the food then I don't want her having any of it.

Now I would not say miles is my best friend. He is a good friend and we do hang out on occasion but see each other on all major holidays because of our parents. 

We are in our early 20s.

The problem started because of a dumb childhood memory. 
When we were 8, we had a wedding play on school after care. I played the bride and miles the groom. It was a play. With horrible songs and uncoordinated kids.

Obs our parents made pictures and videos of that. And we each have one picture on our family picture walls.

Miles is dating Lindy. They met 3 years ago and started dating last year. Lindy does not like me.

So every time we concide at a celebration, she makes a comment about me being the typical girl best friend. She one time said that I secretly wanted to sleep with Miles. 

I have no clue where she got that impression from. Miles and I have different friend groups and schedules. Besides the monthly catch-up over food, we didn't really meet that much.

Things got worse when Lindy saw the wedding play picture.
The comments just got more. She even started DMing me on Instagram saying ""she knew what game i was playing.""

I talked to Miles once about this, and he told me to give her time.

So his birthday was on Saturday and I was invited. Lindy  wrote me saying something along the lines that she was going to supervise me. This was their first birthday as a couple, and I was not allowed to take up his time. 

I was honestly just fed up. I tried talking to Miles once more, but he said the same thing.

So I just skipped out. When the party started I wrote a quick sorry I can't come and told him my mother was going to bring his present.

Now he is upset with me for missing his birthday
 Lindy is mad that I made it all about myself, and my parents are upset I missed a ""family function""

Aita ?


Edit: I didn't show anyone the messages because it didn't want to make more out of this than it is.

I didn't want to poison anyone against Lindy, especially not if she is a new fixture in Miles life. That would make both our lives more difficult. I hoped that just talking about it might be the more adult thing.

My parents are not mad at me or blowing up my phone. Ala reddit fashion. They and Miles parents were just bummed out  that this was the first birthday that I ever missed.

As to why she is jealous. I have no idea. Neither of our parents ever wanted us to get together. There were no jokes or anything about it. I think they also never would want that.

Take my time, answer emails on my phone or take scheduled calls.  Wait for traffic to die down.  Drive to client site by 10:00.  Some team members already there, some come later, some come after lunch.  Work till 6 or 7.  Often not the last one to leave.  Work gets done, no one at work cares.  

But this schedule kinda is junk for my wife.  She works from home.  Gets up a little before me to logon by 8.  She can get lots done while at home like cleaning and laundry and cooking.  I get home by 7 and food is ready.  We watch tv while eating.  Our apartment-mate, who is her sibling, always tries to do the dishes because that‚Äôs how they are.  Just considerate hard working and clean people.  Every once in a while my wife complains that I just come home watch tv and eat and don‚Äôt do anything.  But I argue it‚Äôs not fair to do things first and then complain I don‚Äôt do them.  It‚Äôs like I have to eat faster, get to the sink and box out the sibling to do the dishes.  

It‚Äôs not a huge deal, since I do help clean and always take out the trash and do basically all the handywork which I enjoy doing.  And laundry if the timing ends up on a weekend.  

But sometimes she wants to go walking after work and she doesn‚Äôt like to walk alone.  And I think she doesn‚Äôt like me coming home after she cooks.  She wants to get dinner ready together.  

But I really really hate waking up early.

Amongst it was to have a Christmas eve altogether with my parents because Xmas means a lot to me and to make me a promise to go on a holiday trip to a certain mountain once I am healthy again so I can have something to look forward to. This was a huge deal for me because asking for help is something I do not at all because of my fear of rejection.

Unfortunately both of my wishes were not granted. At first he did tell me that he will go to that mountain with me, just to see him telling me that he will ""most probably/maybe"" do it with me. I saw a promise being reversed. And we did spend Christmas separately (me and my parents and my brother with his wife and child) because of some reasons within the family.

So we talked about it a few times in February, but realised that I needed some time on my own to process it, because it was a very painful experience for me and felt like being let down by him in a difficult time. I kinda broke off the contact to him for a few weeks.

So yesterday I talked to him again, and basically asked him if he is willing to put in some more effort into our relationshi ans to talk things out a bit more because that i would need that in order to move forward. Its mainly because I realised that I have some suppressed emotions and was very unhappy regarding a lot of things in the last few years, and that i need to let that out of my system. He said he needs to think about it and that it's not his way of moving forward, saying he'd wish that we talk in some kind of normal way again so that this would not be so hard all the time.

I need to say that we had a very good and super close relationship in the past. He is actually a very kind person, and has helped me a lot in general. But I had quite a realisation a few months ago, that I was not living life based on my terms and my values. Since I am starting doing this ans actually asking for stuff, the relationship to my brother has been falling apart.

Now my question: Am I being the asshole for saying I would need that kind of specific effort from him? And even more not looking after his needs but rather for my own right now?

I need to say that we had a very good and super close relationship in the past. He is actually a very kind person, and has helped me a lot in general. But I had quite a realisation a few months ago, that I was not living life based on my terms and my values. Since I am starting doing this ans actually asking for stuff, the relationship to my brother has been falling apart.

Now my question: Am I being the asshole for saying I would need that kind of specific effort from him? And even more not looking after his needs but rather for my own right now?

My GF has then started to yell and have a go at me saying that ""this is a piss take"" and that ""she is barely going to be able to see me this weekend"" and acting as this is my fault that I've only just been told and I am now informing her that my Mother has asked this of me. 

I am also seeing her tonight (tuesday) and on Thursday and I do this at minimum every week, and i will still be doing this, this week and next week, it just means that i might not get to spend as much time with her this weekend.

She seems hellbent that this is my Fault and is continuing to tell me that ""I need to deal with my Mum"" and to ""tell her you already have plans"" She also says that ""she isnt able to stay round my house during the other days of the weekend because she has clients on during the early morning and evening"" (she is in animal care & dog walking)

So after he finished explaining this all to me, i asked him if he wanted my honest opinion. he said yes so i told him that i think courses are already an over saturated market and most people who make money from online courses already have a social media following. i explained that i thought it wasn't the best idea because he doesn't even have social media to start off with. 

he then responds ""people like you piss me off. like that actually got me heated. i'm so mad right now."" 

i apologized and tried to explain that i wasn't trying to hurt his feelings or anything, i just don't want him to fall into one of these get rich fast scams again. 

he said he was going to the gym and he'd talked to me later then hung up.

144,1cay0r2,AITA for refusing to play video games I hate,"My friend group (this includes my wife), all love to play video games. For years, we played a ton of competitive games, Halo, Overwatch, Apex, Fortnite, etc. And it usually was a fun time. A few years ago, games started inserting a system called Skill based matchmaking, or SBMM for short. This made sure you play against people similar to your groups skill.

I love my friends. But out of all of us, I feel like I was a little bit better than them. When I played solo, I climbed very high in ranked modes. But when I was them, it was typically 50/50. I had to try very, very Hard in games we played, to try and carry our friend group. If I wasn‚Äôt able to carry them, they would weirdly start fussing at me, telling me to ‚Äúactually try‚Äù, or blaming me for losses, even though I was the only one on the team playing objectives, and going positive. About the time Elden Ring came out in 2022, this had reached a boiling point, and I got fed up with being blamed. I was genuinely losing hair, and sleep because of how mean, my friends were being over a video game. 

So I  decided to get lost in Elden Ring. Once I had fully 100% that, the new GOW had come out. I kept playing more and more Single player games, and realized I didn‚Äôt enjoy multiplayer games anymore. Eventually I stopped hopping on their games with them. I played sparingly throughout 2023, maybe a few games every other night, until about late last year, when I dropped online gaming completely. We had one final argument, where I was blamed for being outplayed by an enemy team in Quickplay Overwatch, made up completely of Masters players.

Being blamed likes this, in mode that didn‚Äôt even mater made me realized I only want to play games where I don‚Äôt have to carry my friends, and sweat so hard the game isn‚Äôt even fun anymore. 

So, now, I‚Äôm trying to get to get everyone into some fun PvE games. I offered to buy every Helldivers, they didn‚Äôt want to play.

Soooo okay man. I have just directed my own show along side my best friend, and my partner has helped out through the process as a stage hand. This whole week I have slept at my partners house because models who live out of town have been using my bed, but we are quickly running into an issue of how much of my time I owe them.

So I asked them if I could sleep on the couch. They said ‚Äúno, take my bed I‚Äôll tuck you in‚Äù then proceed to get in the bed and make excuses as to why they should sleep with me and I shouldn‚Äôt go out to the couch. 

(2) This morning‚Äî the show  was last night, my parents suprised me from out of town, I didn‚Äôt get to speak with them after the show due to all of the commotion, so we planned to get breakfast. So after I wake up and cuddle with my boyfriend, I start asking to be off of work and simultaneously do a few routine tasks for my job so that I‚Äôm not behind . As this is happening my boyfriend is behind me burning holes through my head watching my phone as I do everything waiting for me to chat but, I can‚Äôt because I have to meet my parents in 20 mins on the other side of town, as I do work and change to leave, so all I could do was cuddle with them. 

(3) Now, we have spent the whole afternoon together at the venue so my best friend and I could clean, talk to the venue director about another show, and bond. My boyfriend came and had a good time, he gets along with them both really well. They wanted to sit and cuddle with me in front of the venue director but I said ‚Äúno‚Äù and they were very offended. We all finally part ways and it‚Äôs 1 oclock in the morning (a common occurrence trying to put on these shows). 

So when I get home they call me, hurt saying I need to find time to hang out with them one on one, I should have them be more involved with me and my best friend on the back end of the show building process, I should post them on my instagram more‚Ä¶.so I basically said this sounds like it‚Äôs getting codependent, I have to focus on this new thing in my life and I need space, am I the asshole?‚Ä¶.

146,1caxlsf,AITA for correcting people who thought my brother was a girl?,"I have a little brother (26M) who's 5'5"" and skinny. He also has long hair down to his armpits. Additionally, he has kind of full lips, high cheeks, and groomed eyebrows. So with all that in mind, he gets mistaken for a girl a lot. I really didn't realize he kind of looked like a girl until this whole thing happened and I thought about it. He just looked like the same little brother to me but with unusually long hair.

On Saturday, he came up to see me, and we did our usual routine of heading to Target to get Starbucks. We did a little shopping, and a lady who was in her way said, ""Ope - I'm sorry, Miss!"" I went, ""He's a boy."" She gave him a weird look and walked away. It happened AGAIN with the cashier who said, ""Thanks for shopping with us, Miss!"" I corrected him the same way, he apologized, and my brother gave me a puzzled look. Then at Starbucks, the barista asked, ""Will that be all, Miss?"" I corrected her and she apologized, saying he looks just like her younger sister. My brother turned to me and said, ""You need to stop. I literally don't care either way. They're just words."" People were looking over at us, so I said nothing and went back to the car.

My brother told me to never correct anybody again because he didn't mind, and that it was apparently jeopardizing his safety to say anything at all. I told him to chill out because I was just letting them know he's a man. He went, ""Well, they probably think they're gonna get fired now! If I don't care what people call me, neither should you!""

I really didn't realize he kind of looked like a girl until this whole thing happened and I thought about it. He just looked like the same little brother to me but with unusually long hair.

On Saturday, he came up to see me, and we did our usual routine of heading to Target to get Starbucks. We did a little shopping, and a lady who was in her way said, ""Ope - I'm sorry, Miss!"" I went, ""He's a boy."" She gave him a weird look and walked away. It happened AGAIN with the cashier who said, ""Thanks for shopping with us, Miss!"" I corrected him the same way, he apologized, and my brother gave me a puzzled look. Then at Starbucks, the barista asked, ""Will that be all, Miss?"" I corrected her and she apologized, saying he looks just like her younger sister. My brother turned to me and said, ""You need to stop. I literally don't care either way. They're just words."" People were looking over at us, so I said nothing and went back to the car.

My brother told me to never correct anybody again because he didn't mind, and that it was apparently jeopardizing his safety to say anything at all. I told him to chill out because I was just letting them know he's a man. He went, ""Well, they probably think they're gonna get fired now! If I don't care what people call me, neither should you!""

I 16f have and older brother 17m. He has ADHD, and he thinks that means he can do anything. He's done things before and blamed it on his ""disease"" (as he calls it, not me), and my parents don't do anything about it. The other weekend, while my parents were out and we had a sitter, my brother invited friends over to record a video for his school film class. They said they were going to ""bake something"". I felt happy for him, as he was finally getting somewhere with friends and a social life.

Turns out I was extremely wrong.

They come home with mac and cheese, tuna, avocado, and more random things. They then start recording and mixing all this together, also using a bunch of flour and two eggs (by using a hammer on the expensive counter to crack them btw) to cook up something that they put in the oven. The whole house smelled awful and the counter was cracked. The sitter and I had to open up all the windows and sit outside for hours. When we came back, and my brother went to walk his friend home, there were eggs on the counter, tuna juice everywhere, and something rotting.

It took a lot of nudging to actually get him to clean, and he still did a half-ass job of it. I told my parents about the situation and they said they would handle it.

They get home, he gets a two minute lecture, and they move on. Lectures don't affect him, and he still does things anyway. I thought at the very least they'd take his devices.

My brother decides to show my parents his funny video, and I watch in horror as they contaminate the kitchen's flour, eggs, and a DVD of Shrek (for some weird reason. They didn't cook it though). Parents still did nothing. I started yelling at my brother about how he wasted about $40 of food and how that could have gone to someone in need, but instead it was used for his dumb video.

He said ""Well my disease was kicking in that day, so it doesn't matter"". As the title says, I said ""Your 'disease' shouldn't let you get away with anything.""

My parents say I overreacted, and that it wasn't a big deal, and now I'm in trouble with them. My friends say I was in the right. I need an unbiased opinion. AITA?

148,1caws6f,AITA for refusing trips with my father and brother,"My father left for another family when me and my twin brother were 14 years old, our little sister was 3 at that time. A nasty divorce and a bunch of bad meetings between us and him kind of erased any form of contact in the 10 years that followed. Years later, in 2018, we established contact again and slowly things got better to the point that we see each other a few times a year. My brother and I both have families, he has a 5 year old, my wife and I have no kids.

I have now refused again and again to go on the trips, because I really want him to actually make an effort including my family. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care. It feels very much as if he is just living in the past. 

Even though I have asked him to use the money he spends on the plane tickets and fancy hotels (he has money) to just rent a cabin or house and invite both our families for the weekend, he has continued to just book fancy trips for me and my brother.

My question is Am I The Asshole for refusing him and asking him to connect with his sons families instead of trying to make up for lost time and ignoring the people we have become so far? It really sucks that I am always the only one resisting and don‚Äôt seem grateful.

A little background, my sister 27 recently got a new dog with her long time boyfriend. they were super excited to show off their dog to the rest of the family. so I decided to throw a BBQ sort of family get together for us to meet their dog and for their dog to meet my dogs.  


This happened over a week ago, but my head still hurts just thinking about it. On the day of the get together everything was going fine, everyone arrived (almost) on time and  everything was going smoothly. Till my sister and her boyfriend decided to start drinking quite a lot and not really watching their dog, he wasn't aggressive or anything like that but he was still new and getting used to new people. (I've been told he came from a pretty bad home) I went inside to grab a few more drinks for guests and to grab the food to cook, while I was inside my sisters dog jumped over my gate and ran onto the street where he was hit by a passing car. He miraculously survived and with surgery and time to heal he will be fine and back to normal.  


All of me and my family left with my sister to comfort her and make sure she's okay, I was a little late to arriving since my car is recently out of commission and i had to wait for a taxi. When i arrived at the emergency clinic my sister blew up on my that it was my fault her dog jumped the gate and as i was hosting i should have been watching and its my fault the gate wasn't tall enough.  


A little more background, my dogs are both very small dogs. I have a smaller then average gate but my dogs could never jump it even if they tried their best. My sister had sent me no photos, details, anything about her dog so i had no idea how big he was or anything like that. i also didn't know he was really scared and would sometimes try to run away.  


My sister blamed me for everything and my family agreed with her, I apologized many times and i tried to explain to her why i didnt know he would do that but she simply said i was horrible and my parents called me an asshole for saying its her fault (i never did). fast forward to today when she told me that because its my fault she  wants me to pay all of his medical bills.

That she rather see him alive one more time rather than go to his funeral. 

Side note, my grandpa and I are almost always honest with each other. I was one of the only people he actively spoke about the war to.

Some bg info before we start, I'm 14, the friend is 17, I'm a Kemetic pagan and he is an atheist. Now the little kid is a 12-year-old and is Christian.  
""Soooo basically. \*insert user\* was inviting atheists and satanists (those whom she had never met or interacted with, by the way) to her christian group. We nicely declined (I think there were four, maybe five of us?) and she started telling us that we would go to hell, that we needed jesus and invalidating our beliefs and our trauma from her religion. We were all very nice but she was awful about it.  she INSTANTLY started getting defensive and nasty with us, saying that we were ""bullying"" her (we literally were just nicely asking her to please stop pushing her religion on us. We were using smiley faces and hearts and everything.)

But no matter what we did, this kid was RELENTLESS. She would not give up, invalidating our trauma, saying ""Christianity is perfect, there's no way it traumatized you! Your lying!"" (Keep in mind, this girl is 12. She cannot spell nor put up a good argument. Dmetri is 14 and I am 17.) So anyways, it escalated because she just kept saying ""Jesus loves you"" every time we nicely asked her to stop interacting with us, and to please respect the fact that everyone has their individual, unique belief set.""  
That's basically what happened, I don't wanna go full into detail but she was being an asswipe, knew she was being one and went ""well :3 ur bullying me for calling me out""  
LIKE WHAT?! I'm pissed, the people involved are pissed, and I wanna know am I the ass?

OH AND TO ADD RQ She has no mental problems, and we personally think since she's 12, she should fucking know better-  
Anyways, am I the asshole? (I might not respond to everything, but for the most part I'm reading them \^\^ )

  
Quick edit cuz forgot : I have a leg condition that's fairly new, need a cane to walk, she made fun on that so yea :3",TL;DR,2024-04-23,"AITA for being mad at a little kid? So, to start, this is being told by my friend to another person, and they got everything in it. I wasn't there for a bit of it but I was involved for most of the drama.  
Some bg info before we start, I'm 14, the friend is 17, I'm a Kemetic pagan and he is an atheist. Now the little kid is a 12-year-old and is Christian.  
""Soooo basically. \*insert user\* was inviting atheists and satanists (those whom she had never met or interacted with, by the way) to her christian group. We nicely declined (I think there were four, maybe five of us?) and she started telling us that we would go to hell, that we needed jesus and invalidating our beliefs and our trauma from her religion. We were all very nice but she was awful about it.  she INSTANTLY started getting defensive and nasty with us, saying that we were ""bullying"" her (we literally were just nicely asking her to please stop pushing her religion on us. We were using smiley faces and hearts and everything.)

But no matter what we did, this kid was RELENTLESS. She would not give up, invalidating our trauma, saying ""Christianity is perfect, there's no way it traumatized you! Your lying!"" (Keep in mind, this girl is 12. She cannot spell nor put up a good argument. Dmetri is 14 and I am 17.) So anyways, it escalated because she just kept saying ""Jesus loves you"" every time we nicely asked her to stop interacting with us, and to please respect the fact that everyone has their individual, unique belief set.""  
That's basically what happened, I don't wanna go full into detail but she was being an asswipe, knew she was being one and went ""well :3 ur bullying me for calling me out""  
LIKE WHAT?! I'm pissed, the people involved are pissed, and I wanna know am I the ass? Cuz it's mixed from the people I've asked, the people saying I am start with I shouldn't have gotten involved, but she started talking shit to me and abt me from our first interaction so, ofc I wasn't going to let her say really cruel shit to me and not respond with something to defend myself-

155,1caw52o,AITA for asking for more money while pet sitting ,"I am currently looking after a dog that is 17 years old. I had previously looked after him a year ago and everything was fine there was no issues. I now have my own dog that I share with my brother part time and when this family asked me to take care of there dog I wouldn‚Äôt have mine so I agreed. Little did I know that it hasn‚Äôt even been a week and this dog can not control when it needs to poo or pee. We were told it should be able to be okay from 10-12 hours. And the first day he peed all over my carpet and liked inside his own bed. I take the dog out 3 times a day in the morning, afternoon and before bed.  There has been very few times where the dog has gone potty outside rather than inside my studio apartment (he‚Äôs also gone in the elevator). I am cleaning up this dogs waste all the time and it‚Äôs worse than training my 7 month old puppy. I have talked to the owners  and they said it‚Äôs very unusual behaviour and that they are really sorry about this. They are also away for another 12 days before I give the dog back. All together I‚Äôll have the dog for 17 days and I‚Äôm getting paid 600$. But honestly this wasn‚Äôt what I was signing up for and I made sure to asked questions about his health before agreeing. I‚Äôve had to throw about my carpet and use a lot of my cleaning supplies that I use with my own dog as well as my dogs poop bags because they didn‚Äôt pack any. The dog additionally stinks. Which is so frustrating cause I only live in a studio apartment so I smell it constantly. All in all it‚Äôs a super frustrating situation and I don‚Äôt know if I should ask for more since I would have never taken this dog knowing how much worse he‚Äôs gotten.

The bad news is my name (and my ex's name) are still on my ex's car loan and they are not paying the bill for it. My ex stopped paying the car bill several months ago while we were getting our divorce. 

I didn't want that to hurt my credit so I paid it before it went 30 days delinquent... Christmas day... Fast forward to now and my ex has not made a single payment on the car since. I'm making all of them... The day before it goes delinquent. I even let it go delinquent once to see if they would pay it after...

They didn't. 

I kept having to pay the bill month after month. It felt like we were playing chicken. But, idk if they even know about it because they won't talk to me except through my divorce lawyer. They haven't talked to me, despite my efforts to reach them, for 9 months. Fast forward to now, and the divorce is finalized and I'm still making the car payments. 

I haven't seen this car in 9 months. They have it on one side of the country and I'm living on the other. I told my ex I need them to refinance the car into their name but I'm expecting they won't do it because they have gone out of they're way to hurt me every step of the way. So...

158,1cau55g,AITA for holding a grudge against my step son? ,"My (37m) wife (34f) was diagnosed with cancer in November, started treatment later that month, and has just finished chemo. Her follow up scan is next month. 

She has two children from a previous relationship (14, 11), I have three daughters from a previous relationship, and we have no children together. 

My oldest step son (14) has not been around since last January save for a week in July when they went to my in laws house for the 4th of July, once in September when he lied to us about a situation with his friend trying to convince us to let his friend sleep over at our house on a school night, and over Christmas to collect his gifts. We waited until after Christmas to tell the kids about my wife's cancer so they could all enjoy their holiday. When we told the boys, neither of them asked any questions, neither of them said much at all.. but when the oldest finally did speak all he said was, ""I want chick fil a. Take me home before you go get it."" We were out for a drive when my wife broke the news. He then called his grandmother and had her come pick him up, taking his gifts with him despite being told that his new things were for our house.. not for his father's house.

We have not seen my step son since. He has not called, not texted, not visited.. nothing. There have been other issues over the years with him telling outrageous lies to his father and the school guidance counselor that even resulted in CPS visiting our home on more than one occasion - every time they closed the case without incident based on our interviews and what our other kids said/how they acted during the visits. 

A few days ago my wife mentioned that she was upset about her son not being around in general, but that it was particularly rough to have not seen or heard from him while she was/is literally battling stage 4 cancer. I stated that while I am not one to hold a grudge, and I'm not, that this was going to be hard for me to get over and I was going to continue to be frustrated about this for a long time. I have always been frustrated with him for how he treats his mother, but this really was the straw that broke the camels back. My wife then told me that if she is not mad about it, that I am not allowed to be either. 

But.. I am. And I'm not going to just not be mad about this. This is a 14 year old person.. someone far old enough to understand what he is doing and how hurtful his actions are. This is not a young child that doesn't know what cancer is or understand that treatment is hard and that he very well may lose his mother. For a while I did think maybe he was avoiding it out of fear - but he has been refusing to see his mother or anyone else in the family for well over a year because he was punished for lying and his .98gpa. 


So.. AITA for holding a grudge against my stepson? 

Edit: I do truly appreciate every single one of you that has commented with advice or your opinion. I do want to go ahead and say as I should have said in the original post that I have tried therapy. All the rest of the kids are in therapy. My wife and I are both in therapy and I have tried several times with several different therapists and counselors to get him to go talk to someone and I plan on trying again today.
