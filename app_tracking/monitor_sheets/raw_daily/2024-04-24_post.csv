0,1cc9wh7,AITA For Leaving my Band Suddenly?,"Hey y'all, so a day ago I (F23) sent my band a long text in our gc about me leaving the group. Currently it was myself on drums, our singer (M26, and our guitarist (M22).There were 3 points. They were that a) I had been having some mixed feelings about the group and chemistry, the singer and guitarist were getting into fights about logistics and rehearsals often before our last major gig. I'm trans, and some jokea and comments from our singer have rubbed me the wrong way in the past (nothing major like blatant misgendering, to be clear). Additionally, I had been running into other musicians that have been with this group before (they went through 4 or 5 other drummers before me) and they told me I should be wary.
B) I was realizing that my solo project that I had been doing for a few years before which I had put down for this was ultimately more creatively fulfilling, and I was missing dedicating time to it. 
C) As my plate is filling up, (I also do anti-war and lgbt-activism here in Louisiana) I didn't feel like I could push that aside to make time for band and solo work.

The reaction to the text was very negative, insisting I should have made a call. When I called the singer he called me a coward and a liar for being indecisive/and not making my trepidation clear enough before this point. He also accused me and one of the other queer musicians he played with before that I talked to of trying to cancel him. He said the band would probably be done and that I fucked it all. 

He sent me a message later that day telling me to never talk to him again, even though I tried to be clear in my message I didn't have any I'll will towards them of their music. Today at work, the singer, who is on the same job site as me, avoided me and even hid my bowl and chopsticks I usually use for lunch in the break room from me 

I understand that I didn't make my trepidation and ensuing burnout super clear to them before this message and it probably came as shock. I want to recognize that feeling blindsided and hurt by it is valid. However I'd only been with the band for four or so months and we'd only played three gigs. I was not expecting to yelled at over the phone and harassed at work. AITA and getting my just desserts? ",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-04-24,"AITA For Leaving my Band Suddenly?

1,1cc4mwq,AITA for not helping my friend in their time of need?,"Hi. So, this issue is actually a little old, but I could really use some perspective.

A few years ago, I had a best friend who was going through a breakup from an unhealthy relationship. Apparently the breakup was one sided; my friend didn‚Äôt WANT to breakup, but his boyfriend did.
Anyways, said friend (we were long distance) would call me every single day after we got off school, listen to sad music while on call, and just sit there and cry. He would tell me his life was over, he couldn‚Äôt go on without his partner, etc. over, and over. This went on for weeks. Watching him suffer was breaking my heart, and I did everything I could to be there for him as much as possible, including setting aside my own issues and schoolwork.
Finally, one day, I had a big issue pop up in my personal life, and I was struggling to hold the weight of his emotions and mine. It was sucking the life out of me. I told him that for the time being, I needed the sitting on the phone in silence while he listened to sad music to stop, and I couldn‚Äôt hold his emotions alongside mine. He got pretty upset, and reminded me that I promised I‚Äôd always be there for him. I acknowledged the promise, told him I loved and cared, but in order to keep the promise, I needed to help myself first, as I felt like I was already drowning on my own.
Some time later, I let him know that I was doing better, and would be more than happy to help if he needed me. He acknowledged my statement, but proceeded to stop talking about issues. He would pretend to be okay, when I knew he wasn‚Äôt. I tried multiple times to let him know I was all good, and ready to help. 
A couple months later, I asked him why he felt like he couldn‚Äôt talk to me. He told me that it was because of when I shocked him by telling him I couldn‚Äôt hold the weight of his problems. He told me that because of his trauma with women, he couldn‚Äôt distinct my ‚Äúfemale behavior‚Äù from abusive behavior (I‚Äôm non-binary). He said he couldn‚Äôt trust me just backtracking on my word.
I apologized, and asked how we could fix the issue. Instead of coming up with solutions, he just repeated his feelings and told me he couldn‚Äôt trust me. I acknowledged it, apologized again, and asked once more if there was a way we could fix the issue. He, once again, just repeated himself, and even told me i had reminded him of his mother. 
After a few tries, I became defensive. I told him that no matter what I said or did, he was just coming after me. I told him that I wanted to fix the problem, but I genuinely no longer knew how, since he wasn‚Äôt giving me anything other than blame.
Finally, I ended up being the one to come up with the solution on my own.

I‚Äôm writing this because I wonder if perhaps I was the asshole for asking for some emotional space. He was extremely heartbroken, so maybe I should have just sucked it up and continued to sit in his grief with him. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten defensive.

3,1cbs9yf,AITA for refusing to let my dad touch me (affectionately not inappropriately),"AITA for not letting my dad touch me? My father (42 Male) has always been physically affectionate because it‚Äôs one of his love languages. He cares so much about having a close relationship with me and my younger sister and about being present in our lives. But I don‚Äôt like it and it really hurts his feelings. 

When I (14 non-binary) was younger I had long, naturally curly, hair and I didn‚Äôt know how to keep it from getting tangled. When my dad would run his fingers through my hair (kind of a petting thing) he‚Äôd snag tangles then try to pull them out. This really hurt, so I‚Äôd push him away or tell him to stop but he told me that refusing it made him feel hurt and unappreciated so I cut my hair short in 5th grade. 

After realizing that I like many aspects of the style I kept it and haven‚Äôt had long hair since. When I mentioned a while ago that I cut it to get my dad to stop hurting me he got really upset at me and told me a little more about his childhood and how his parents never cared and why he tries so hard with us. I felt awful. We had a great conversation and I apologized, but then he moved in to hug me. I put my arms in front of me and said ‚Äúno‚Äù kind of panicked tone (this was a knee-jerk reaction, not conscious) and then my dad left the house angrily and slammed the door.

When I‚Äôm emotional, my dad offers me a hug and I‚Äôm supposed to take it, even if I feel worse, because my dad really wants to comfort me. My dad has explained how his parents were super removed and unresponsive and he said he never wants us to feel that way, because he is a super great dad.

After this I reflected and realized how much I hate it when I‚Äôm touched. Since then, I‚Äôve tried to set boundaries with my dad, but I can‚Äôt tell him not to touch me at all, obviously because he‚Äôll ask why and I can‚Äôt tell him it makes my skin crawl. When I try to set boundaries like ‚Äòdon‚Äôt touch me when I‚Äôm emotional‚Äô or ‚Äòtell me before you hug me‚Äô those boundaries aren‚Äôt respected. 
So I‚Äôve started saying ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù clearly when he tries now. He‚Äôll try to ask for specific boundaries but he ignores them within the hour, and he‚Äôs equally offended when I remind him of a boundary as when I set one.

5,1cbos45,AITA for not attending my friend‚Äôs graduation?,"As graduation season approaches, I've found myself caught in a bit of a bind. I (21F) am graduating college next month. I go to a large university and we have multiple ceremonies depending on which college you‚Äôre in.

Recently, my friend, who is also graduating (22F), expressed disappointment that I won't be attending her ceremony. To give some context, we're both graduating on the same day but at different times‚Äîher ceremony is later in the day, while mine is earlier. On that day, I've already made dinner reservations with my family to celebrate, coinciding with the time of her graduation.

I explained to her that I can't cancel my plans with my family to attend her ceremony, but from her perspective, she was hoping I would be there. I think there might have been a misunderstanding because we hadn't really discussed our graduation plans in depth before this. Now, she's upset with me, and some of our mutual friends are siding with her, arguing that attending each other's graduations is expected. However, some of them won't graduate until next year, which makes it easier for them to attend multiple ceremonies without their own conflicting schedules.

I feel stretched thin with everything going on, and with my family visiting, I want to prioritize celebrating with them. Plus, I'm not sure what they would do during her ceremony, which could be over an hour and a half long‚ÄîI wouldn't want to leave them alone, especially since they've traveled a long way to support me.

If I had more time, I would love to be there for my friend, but realistically, it's just not feasible to do everything in one day. It's my graduation too, and I want to make it special.

6,1cbolj9,WIBTA if I forced these RV people to leave?,"Every few months, an RV parks about 30 feet from my house in a pretty quiet neighborhood. I don't know these people. I believe it is an older couple who drive their RV to come visit their family that lives in the area. They stay anywhere from a few days to a month. The issue I have with it, is that they run their engine on idle from around 5:00 p.m. until 9:00 a.m. - all night long - to keep their electricity running. It's a large vehicle, so the engine is not quiet. It's not super loud, but it can be heard from anywhere inside my house. It's a low rumbling sound that disturbs our family's sleep and gives us a headache. It's about the volume level of a ceiling fan on the highest setting, only low and bassy. 

I want to stress that they are not on my property. They are street parked on a public road. They aren't trespassing. The only thing they are doing that's against city policy is parking in the same spot for more than 48 hours. 

I've politely spoken to them about it. They were polite too, but they made it clear they weren't going to stop this behavior. They get too cold if they stop their engine. I could potentially get local police to enforce the city code and get them to move, but then they'll just park in front of someone else's house and bother them.

7,1cbodz2,AITA for not wanting to buy my daughter the dress she loved?,"I (38M) have a 14YO daughter but am no longer with her mom (34F).  We have not been together in 9+ years and have 50/50 custody.  Since my daughter has been in middle school, I have spoken with both her mother and her about wanting to be involved when it comes to school dances, and it would be nice if the parent who will have her the night of the dance was the one who got the dress and helped her get ready.  But every dance, her mom has gotten her dress and then insisted because she got the dress she be the one to get her ready - interrupting the time my daughter is scheduled to be with me.  She has even gone as far as to refuse to let my daughter come over the weekend of a dance, even if it is my time.

My daughter is now coming up on her last middle school dance.  Again, she is scheduled to be at my house for this, but again her mom took her shopping without talking to me about it.  The dress she ‚Äúfell in love with‚Äù fits the Under the Sea theme, but is $400, which I think is too much for a middle school formal.   I expressed this to her mother, explaining once shoes and make up and other things are factored in she will be spending well over $500 and it seems excessive for the occasion and sets unreasonable expectations.  Her response was to say I never want to pay for anything and it‚Äôs worth every penny and I have no business giving her a hard time about wanting to make our daughter happy.  AITA?

Some notes:

* she did ask me to contribute and I never said I wouldn‚Äôt.  I did tell her I would only contribute what I consider to be a reasonable amount.
* I pay a small child support, but we have a 50/50 split and I have had to ask her mother to stop bringing things to my house (like water bottles) for her because I am more than capable and willing to provide for her when she is here.
* When other expenses come up, like school trips, I have helped pay toward them.  I am in now way trying to get out of supporting my daughter.

I (38M) have a 14YO daughter but am no longer with her mom (34F).  We have not been together in 9+ years and have 50/50 custody.  Since my daughter has been in middle school, I have spoken with both her mother and her about wanting to be involved when it comes to school dances, and it would be nice if the parent who will have her the night of the dance was the one who got the dress and helped her get ready.  But every dance, her mom has gotten her dress and then insisted because she got the dress she be the one to get her ready - interrupting the time my daughter is scheduled to be with me.  She has even gone as far as to refuse to let my daughter come over the weekend of a dance, even if it is my time.

My daughter is now coming up on her last middle school dance.  Again, she is scheduled to be at my house for this, but again her mom took her shopping without talking to me about it.  The dress she ‚Äúfell in love with‚Äù fits the Under the Sea theme, but is $400, which I think is too much for a middle school formal.   I expressed this to her mother, explaining once shoes and make up and other things are factored in she will be spending well over $500 and it seems excessive for the occasion and sets unreasonable expectations.  Her response was to say I never want to pay for anything and it‚Äôs worth every penny and I have no business giving her a hard time about wanting to make our daughter happy.  AITA?

Some notes:

* she did ask me to contribute and I never said I wouldn‚Äôt.  I did tell her I would only contribute what I consider to be a reasonable amount.
* I pay a small child support, but we have a 50/50 split and I have had to ask her mother to stop bringing things to my house (like water bottles) for her because I am more than capable and willing to provide for her when she is here.
* When other expenses come up, like school trips, I have helped pay toward them.  I am in now way trying to get out of supporting my daughter.

We are relatively close in the sense that his dad usually brings him and his siblings down to visit with us once or twice a year, and when they are here, I am usually with them in some capacity every day and I will take him and his siblings to do fun things and it'll be just us. 

I really would like to work out going, but my schedule is insane (I work two jobs, own a home, am a full-time student, have two dogs, and am in a relationship) and I have a lot of debt and don't want to add to it to go.   


Here is where the issue lies with me: travel. It is an 11-hour drive and the closest major airport is about 4 hours away and my uncle has already told us that he will not come to get us if we fly in there. My mom only wants to go from Thursday-Monday and neither one of us wants to drive our cars (I have a valid reason - my AC does not work, my mom is just being difficult about using her truck). So my only options are driving 11 hours and wasting a shit ton of money on gas and a rental car, spending $500+ on flights to a small town airport, or flying into a major airport and still having to rent a car and drive. None of which I want to spend the money or time on for a 4-day trip if I am being honest.

Significant other recently unfairly lost her job. We both make low six figures, and are new to this income, both having this pay for around a year; our savings are low. 

We are about to move out of our place to a new one with a new lease. We've begun a large argument.  She believes that I should handle the rent and moving costs because she will burn through her savings. I was willing to do this, but I feel she should, when and if she has the means, pay back into my account. 

She thinks this is wrong, that if I care about her, I should support her without any expectation of reimbursement, or that it shows a lack of trust to expect her to help pay me back. That she has friends whose so's are holding down costs in similar situations with no expectation. 

She says, ""I would burn through my whole savings."" Which is exactly what I will have to do if i pay for everything. But that's not what I'm asking her to do, I'm saying I will pay, and she can reimburse when she can, if she can. 

This move will cost a lot, and we have two months of rent to pay in our current place still. I'm saying, I will pay, just when you are back on the wagon (in likely a 6 figure job (and likely very soon)) pay me back when you can. 

 I feel like the idea of me paying 15k over the next two months and her getting a job and thinking it's wrong to pay me back, or that I'm a bad person for thinking she should, when and if she can is unfair. It feels completely reasonable to me to expect this. 

And too, I had lost my job a bit back, and she maintained hers, and I continued to pay rent and bills fairly. There was not an offer from her to take on the demands. 

I feel like I understand the position of, well aren't we going to be together? What does it matter? But then feel that is a flippable position. If we're going to be together, it shouldn't matter to reimburse into my account. 

I am pretty much dead set in my position. I can't understand how she would think it's fair that I take the burden with no expectation to reimburse, which I think I have fairly laid out as, when and if able.

The afternoon I moved in, one of my neighbours came up to the steps (each apartment has a little front area, and mine faces the carpark). She introduced herself, single mom with a 4 year old daughter and gave me a small succulent to say welcome. I was very appreciative, said thank you and we spoke for a few minutes.

I work three days from home, and am usually home in the evening after work and at night.

It is nice, but I do prefer to keep to myself, and often I'm in my baggy tee or not dressed for visitors, I have to kind of make myself presentable in under a minute with no notice.

This latest instance, they showed up around 7pm. The daughter had made some kind of drawing and wanted to drop it off. I'd had a long day (was in a giant sweater, looking a mess but insanely comfy, ice cream on the couch, watching a film) saw them through the window, had to quickly jump up, put on shorts, and greet them at the door.

Said thank you as always, daughter wanted to come in, see what I was watching. Nothing terrible, just a bit too grown up for a 4 year old. I politely said, look, thank you but I'm really not in the mood tonight and could they please leave.

We tend to argue on again off again with there usually being a mutual understanding of what we individually did wrong, lately it‚Äôs all been pushed that im the one in the wrong. 

Flash forward to tonight. she mentioned being hungry several times and naturally I offered to make her something or go heat up some leftovers for her since she had a long day. She tells me that no, she doesn‚Äôt want anything we have at the house. i once again offer her something we have at home and she again says no. I don‚Äôt have a lot of money right now so ordering out for us isn‚Äôt an option.

 I get a little upset at this, explain how im feeling,  and grab the leftovers we had in the fridge to go heat up for her as i know that she‚Äôd forget to eat if i didnt make something now. I bring her food back to her and she tells me to set it down, and then asks me why the second we get home i have to ‚Äòjump down her throat.‚Äô I once again repeat why I‚Äôm upset about this (being that her saying shes hungry and refusing to eat anything we have is not okay or healthy) and I leave to my space.

 She begins texting me about how I ruined her night and how I should stop doing things for her flat out. I argue back that I dont see how me wanting her to eat something we had at home ruined her night, and she starts yelling at me that im an asshole and i ruined her night and that i should just stop doing things for her. 

All I wanted to do was help my friend out, am i the asshole?

EDIT 1: She has texted me again telling me to go fuck myself after I left the house to go to my quiet place and calmed down, she knows where said quiet place is and so far has made no motion to come speak to me in person.

18,1cbmyhe,AITA for ignoring my emotionally distant father after trying to forge a relationship for years?,"Am I (22f) the asshole for intentionally ignoring my father's (47m) attempts to contact me after trying to forge a relationship with him for years. 

This is a burner account since idk if anyone I know uses reddit, but recently I've been having a lot of guilt surrounding my relationship, or lack of relationship with my father.

For some background, the man was rarely there for me growing up. I have very little memories of him, or rather, not many good ones at least. He was always drunk, fighting with my narcissistic mother, and I witnessed some pretty messed up stuff because of them.

I have a lot of trauma from my parents, but for years I still ached for a relationship with them. I had been taking care of myself independently since around 15-16, and my mother passed when I was 17, opening the door for my father to come back in my life. I was apprehensive since he had been just as, if not more, unreliable than my mother. I had thought since I was still a minor, he would have no choice but to take me in.

Well... that didn't happen. Shortly after my mother passed, he left me to live alone in that house, the same house I saw my mother dead in. Over the years he has done a lot to hurt me, a lot of screwing me over, and I have voiced my hurt and concerns. I can't go into detail due to character limits, but those closest to me have assured me that my feelings are valid (I work in mental health and my friends all do as well, so we call out bad behavior in each other often out of tough love)

Ive been trying my whole life to have a relationship with him, mostly even more from 17-21, but over the last few months, I can't find it in me to even try to have a relationship with him. He takes care of his new wife's kids better than he ever took care of us, and I really can't stomach to be around it anymore. I have struggled with very bad mental health in the past, a lot of it trauma related, and I have found he makes it worse due to him exhibiting behaviors that caused my trauma (something he is very well aware of)

I'm 22 now, living completely on my own, with no ties to him anymore. I have a stable job that I don't hate, possibly starting a new one that will pay me more and allow me to go to school finally. I'm in a healthy happy relationship with a great guy, and have a small but loving friend group. I've been very happy recently.

The issue now comes in with my father suddenly wanting to make contact with me. I haven't answered since he's appearing to be repeating the same behaviors of love bombing after months of ignoring me, and more. I haven't really spoken to him since around last summer due to him ignoring me, and my decision this winter to go NC. 

I feel very guilty over cutting him out, but with all my past experiences with him, no matter how much I try to speak to him about how his behaviors hurt me, he'll never change. Even the thought of talking/dealing with him is bringing me a sense of dread and making me sick with anxiety.

19,1cbmx8c,AITA for not hearing my wife calling for me?,"This morning my wife said she was going to take our kid to the playground after Family Quiet Time (1-2 hours after lunch where we all sit on our butts while kiddo naps/doesn't nap) so I could cook us dinner in peace. This is not an uncommon occurrence now that it's spring.

95% of the time, I spend Quiet Time in my basement office with noise-cancelling earbuds in. She knows that I hear practically nothing except what I'm playing/watching with these earbuds. She knows this is by design. She knows I will typically miss text messages during this time unless I am specifically waiting for them; she is not a fan of this fact, as she almost always texts me if she needs something. I've told her multiple times that I will never ignore her, and that if I haven't responded to a text, my door is always open.. I'm not clinging to my phone waiting for her to message me in our own home where I'm just a short staircase away. 

Today, however, was one of those days I *was* waiting for a text around the end of Quiet Time to say 'kid is awake' or whatever. (This is the job of the parent with the monitor or the kid: notify the other parent the kid is awake so it can be all hands on deck.) Like I was checking my phone every few minutes, and every time I heard something that remotely resembled our kid running or talking I took an earbud out for a moment to see if I was needed, ready to come up at a moment's notice. But no messages came and I heard nothing suspicious.

Then 3 minutes before I was about to come upstairs to start dinner / help get kiddo ready since I assumed the playground trip would be happening soon, my wife bursts into my office and is like ""what are you doing! I've been calling and shouting for you! We're leaving for the playground now and I wanted your help getting him ready! But now it's too late!"" I'm like.. baffled, firstly, because we typically don't holler for/at each other in this household. I explained I'd been waiting for her to text, was just about to come up, and heard literally nothing through *my noise-cancelling-by-design* earbuds. I also reminded her, as she reminds me when I think she's heard me but hasn't, that **if I didn't respond to her, I didn't hear her.** 

(This one-sided communication piece has come up many times. Essentially she puts the onus on me to be a good communicator: if she didn't hear me, it's my fault for not being clear or repeating myself; if I didn't hear her, it's my fault for not listening. Yes we have a marriage counsellor. No she doesn't use any of the techniques we learn in our sessions. Yes I'm aware this is a bad sign.)

Anyway she keeps berating me for being a bad communicator etc.  as we go upstairs. I take a deep breath, trying to figure out what she's really feeling, and decide to apologize for being unavailable and frustrating her. No dice; she leaves with kiddo and I make dinner.

21,1cbmsdz,"AITA for Not Paying My Friend Rent for a SLEEPOVER?
","Me (18F) and my Friend (19F) lets call her Shay, have been friends for two years, since high school, we would have sleepovers all the time, which might seem a bit strange for some people our age we still found it fun! But it was always great!

When we were first friends we both lived with our parents and we would make plans around going to each others houses. Every time Shay would come over to my house for a sleepover she would bring food of some kind, a treat of something for us to share, no matter what she would bring something even if it meant going to the store and coming an hour late.

I would try and bring snacks when I could/remembered but I most of the time just bought stuff for the both of us if we went out instead. Recently Shay started renting an apartment with a roommate who I have only really seen once, but we still decided to continue with our sleepovers.

While she was moving in we had most of the sleepovers at my place while she unpacked, but then we finally had the chance to have one at her new apartment! I went over and had a sleepover as normal just having fun and goofing off watching movies and all that. I did not bring any snacks to this sleepover, nor did we really go out and buy anything. I thought it was fine.

It was a long weekend so I stayed two nights, It all seemed normal until I started to leave and say good bye. But then Shay came up to me and asked me to pay for rent during the time that I was there. I was shocked, it was a two night sleepover!

She wanted 50$ for while I was there, it was because I ate her food and spent time in her apartment, her roommate paid rent and so did Shay, and because I stayed there I would need to help too. I instantly said no, and that it was crazy. I barely ate anything and she would come over to sleepovers at my place all the time, and before I never had to do anything like this.

I asked her why it was different now and why she doesn't pay me too! But her argument is that she brings food every time to my house and its not my house, its my parent's. That this is her own place that she has to rent during university and she can't just keep free loaders on her budget. If someone stayed here it was their responsibility to help pay for the water, electricity and food used.

I said I wasn't going to pay and stormed out. She still hasn't messaged me back and wont respond to my calls. I feel bad now, and I think it is kind of silly to get in a fight over 50$ especially after such a long friendship. True 25$ a night isn't bad, and I could pay for it... But it's the fact that she didn't tell me before I slept over!

So... AITA for not paying? Should I go back and apologize for getting upset and just give her the money and have sleepovers only at my place now? I don't know if I am in the right or wrong here, my sister says that I should just pay her and keep the friendship instead of having it strained over something dumb... What do you guys think?

She went on about how it‚Äôll make my parents upset if I don‚Äôt stay at the house with them, and I always make things into a whole ordeal.

I don‚Äôt try to make a scene, but it always ends up that way because I don‚Äôt have the same values and beliefs as them. I don‚Äôt mock them for going to church or argue with them about politics. They can do whatever they want, I would just love to be left out of it and not berated. 


TLDR: my family and I have different values, and I don‚Äôt want to start an argument about it by bringing my boyfriend in town

Our house, he had 10 years before I entered the relationship and had been taking care of solo he has been trying to renovate but being a single dad had struggled to pull together the extra funds to update anything but now we are expecting we are looking for a new place because the current one is only two bedrooms and quite small not even close to being big enough for a family of four.

We can have the baby in our room for a short while but we have a maximum of two years before the baby will be mobile and will start to require a separate room and I absolutely would not expect his older daughter to share a room with a toddler that's just not fair and not an option. 

I've been sending him links to places that are bigger within our price range but he always finds something wrong ""the kitchen needs updating""  or ""the bathroom needs redoing"" "" the area isn't great"" 

I told him that these houses are in better condition than his current house and he can't afford to be picky when the tiles are falling off the kitchen walls and the bathroom has a shower curtain as a door.

27,1cbl9m4,AITA for telling my cousin her friend can‚Äôt have a dog?,"This is a little long so sorry in advance!

To start this out I‚Äôll give a little background. My (21F) dog had an accidental litter of GSD/Husky mixes about 6 months ago and we were able to give the dogs to homes we thought were great.

This happened two days ago when one of the owners contacted me saying she could not keep the dog due to her not having time for her and asked if I could pick her up that day. It was extremely last minute and I did not have room at my house due to having my own pets so I had to quickly find someone to take her. This ended up being my grandparents.

After I got her situated at my grandparents I asked around my family and friends to see if anyone maybe knew someone who would like a dog (after I vetted them of course) and got an answer from a few people. One of these was my cousin (28F) who said she had a friend and she would ask him if he would like the dog that was the end of the conversation. I finally hear back from her and she has been conversing with this person on her own and setup a meeting. I tell her that‚Äôs fine he can meet her but I need to be there so I‚Äôll pick her up and she replies back asking why I‚Äôm being guarded and controlling. This struck me as odd because as soon as I picked up this dog she became my responsibility and I need to see where she‚Äôll be going.

We get around to the time of the meeting and the dog is very skittish which is odd as she was not skittish at all when I picked her up or towards my grandparents. She is flinching everytime the man comes near her and is letting him pat her but keeps pulling away. After a little while a few people pull up and I can tell she‚Äôs getting antsy cause 4 people just flooded out of this car including little kids which she is not accustomed to.

During this interaction, she keeps coming back towards me and eventually she ‚Äònips‚Äô the child on the hand. She has bitten before but only when she got spooked and she was in a new place so we didn‚Äôt fault her. During the whole meeting I just was not convinced this was a right fit they didn‚Äôt have the backyard fully fenced,immediately talked about a shock collar and only were talking to my cousin who was there for some reason and not me. It all felt very odd and she also was not feeling it. My cousin kept saying things like ‚Äòshe likes it here‚Äô and ‚Äòshe gave you a love nip how cute‚Äô while not seeing how uncomfortable the dog was.

During the meeting I mention we have other people interested which I do after the guy says he‚Äôll take her Sunday (I never said yes to this) so he says ‚Äòoh okay let me know then‚Äô. The meeting ends and my cousin asks me to come over to her car and starts popping off about how I never told her that and she looks ridiculous to which I tell her I never had to tell her as the dog is mine to decide what to do with.

30,1cbkelg,AITA for refusing to attend my sister‚Äôs wedding? ,"Preface, I‚Äôm on mobile so I apologise for any mistakes. 

Earlier this month I came to the realisation that I have been acting very reactively to my family. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder so I make sure I try to really think about appropriate responses and reactions but despite my best efforts lately I‚Äôve definitely been slipping. 

A couple of weeks ago, I texted my mum and sister on the family group chat asking for some space because there were instances, intentional or not, that left me feeling hurt and abandoned by them. I tried to communicate that this space was for me to think about whether this is how I actually felt or if it was my BPD brain. I reassured that I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt anyone. I communicated that I knew how much they did for me and I wanted to right by them. 

My sister got really angry with me, and weaponised my relationship with my boyfriend and my want to regulate against me. She texted saying how much she‚Äôs done for me and doesn‚Äôt understand why I would need space. I agreed with her saying, I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. She ended up getting angrier with me and uninvited me to her wedding. 

Now my sister and I have not had the best relationship. She‚Äôs done some things to me growing up that have resulted in me being unable to trust, not being able to be comfortable in normal, consensual relationships and just overall be a anxious, angry and sad person. I try not to hold it against her, she was a kid too, but it gets difficult. I am trying to sort out the feelings through therapy. 

My sister has apologised through text, and I have also communicated boundaries through text. I don‚Äôt forgive her though. Life is easier without her and I don‚Äôt feel a loss when not talking to her. My mum and my grandma want me to attend the wedding and be the bigger person. They are want me to just move on, when I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even figure out what I feel. I don‚Äôt want to attend the wedding, not because I‚Äôm being malicious but because I don‚Äôt want to be sad and pretend everything is okay. I‚Äôm tired of being the bigger person.

I communicated that I knew how much they did for me and I wanted to right by them. 

My sister got really angry with me, and weaponised my relationship with my boyfriend and my want to regulate against me. She texted saying how much she‚Äôs done for me and doesn‚Äôt understand why I would need space. I agreed with her saying, I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. She ended up getting angrier with me and uninvited me to her wedding. 

Now my sister and I have not had the best relationship. She‚Äôs done some things to me growing up that have resulted in me being unable to trust, not being able to be comfortable in normal, consensual relationships and just overall be a anxious, angry and sad person. I try not to hold it against her, she was a kid too, but it gets difficult. I am trying to sort out the feelings through therapy. 

My sister has apologised through text, and I have also communicated boundaries through text. I don‚Äôt forgive her though. Life is easier without her and I don‚Äôt feel a loss when not talking to her. My mum and my grandma want me to attend the wedding and be the bigger person. They are want me to just move on, when I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even figure out what I feel. I don‚Äôt want to attend the wedding, not because I‚Äôm being malicious but because I don‚Äôt want to be sad and pretend everything is okay. I‚Äôm tired of being the bigger person.

33,1ccdigp,AITA for not visiting with my out of town relatives directly after my Mama's funeral.,"AITA for not visiting with my cousin and her family who drove from Florida to South Carolina for my Mama's funeral. My Mama passed away in my arms 3 weeks ago after a series of strokes. She had been on hospice and in a care home for two months prior to her passing. My older sister had had knee replacement 2 weeks earlier and I've been taking care of both of them. My oldest son helping feed Mama almost daily to help me. 
The day of the funeral I was very upset; doing my best not to cry hysterically while getting my 3 sons and husband ready. (None of them could tie a proper tie and Mama had wanted them all in suits for the service) I cried while trying to get dressed and we got to the church 15 mins before the viewing. We talked and greeted everyone for an hour, then the service, then our church had a meal for everyone. 
During the meal I sat and talked with my cousin, her husband and sons for a long time. 
My husband left early with my boys. They are autistic introverted and have a lot of social anxiety. I also have mental health issues with PTSD, bipolar and depression.
I stayed and helped clean up and pack flowers and pictures in my van with my sister. On the way home, she says to drive to our friend's house that are hosting my cousin so we can continue visiting. This would be the proper southern thing to do. What Mama would do.
But I was barely holding it together at this point. No spoons No forks and my social battery was dead. I said/agreed to whatever Sister said and left her there 
I drove to the house and cried myself to sleep.
Later my husband got everyone pizza and made me get up and eat something. When Sister got home, she started to yell at me, but husband and oldest stopped her.
Now, three weeks later, Sister is at it again. #1 Southern protocol is write a Thank You card for everything and everyone. So she wants me to write one to cousin to profusely apologize for embarrassing Sister and not visiting with them that aftern. I am also horrible for taking so long to get ready that morning bc we were supposed to be at church at 10 not 1045.
All of this embarrassed her and is just not done. 
I understand that she is deeply entrenched in her Southern rules and protocols and  Sister has all these rules in her head of how to do things (forks and spoons can't be next to each other in dishwasher) Most days, she doesn't tell me things, she thinks she does in her head, but never actually says them to me.

I found a couple of checks in my husband‚Äôs name and when he claimed them, our state mailed him a check for $400. We were so excited, we told a lot of people about this program. 

I didn‚Äôt find anything in my name, but under my surname, about a dozen or so checks came up in my father-in-law‚Äôs name, so I texted to let him and my mother-in-law know what happened with us and how easy it was to claim the money. EDIT: I did NOT go looking for my in-laws info. I typed in MY name and that‚Äôs what came up. 

FIL sent my husband (32M) a series of angry texts accusing us of violating his boundaries and stirring up trouble. Right before the pandemic, my husband got into a huge fight with his mother over boundary issues that led to us being estranged from MIL and FIL for two years. MIL and FIL were very controlling and tended to infantilize my husband, which significantly impacted his mental health and confidence in himself. We tried to reconcile and apologized, while asking for an apology and changed behavior. They were not interested and were ultimately uninvited from our wedding as a result. 

In late 2022, MIL and FIL seemed interested in respecting my husband as a grown adult, and we slowly started talking and getting together for dinner once every 1-2 months again.

When we later asked if they had decided what to do with the apartment, FIL berated us for invading his privacy. (I wouldn‚Äôt have asked if they hadn‚Äôt brought us into it, but whatever.)

With the missing money, I guess I just thought of it as equivalent to saying ‚Äúhey, you dropped your wallet.‚Äù FIL seems very resentful of the estrangement and doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why his boundaries feel less like actual boundaries and more like a revenge tactic.

To which I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not yelling. If you want me to yell, I can effing yell.‚Äù He hung up on me, then we got into a texting argument.

He said he found 20 apartments in my area available for rent. I then went to each one he sent me and proved to him they were senior living or not available at the moment. He‚Äôs still so mad at me for trying to pick a place outside of town and trying to control both my living situation and my bf‚Äôs.

He ended up saying to me that I can ‚Äújust live with my parents like most college kids.‚Äù To which I‚Äôm fighting the urge to respond with ‚Äúdoes that mean that I can go get tattoos, a fake ID, and get drunk like most college kids too? Or is it only conditional?‚Äù

Idk guys, AITAH for fighting with my dad about where I want to live?? Am I being over dramatic and just listen to what he has to say? Or am I justified in trying to control MY living situation?

UPDATE:
So my bf and I just went to look at the studio apartment in town. It‚Äôs not the best, but it‚Äôs cute and we think it‚Äôll work. Besides, this will keep everyone happy. I told my parents. My mom was so excited and happy for me. But my dad said I shouldn‚Äôt get it and keep looking after insisting that we must get a place in town, and this is the only one available. He‚Äôs now trying to pressure me to move in with him without my bf. I‚Äôm starting to think he just doesn‚Äôt want me to grow up and stay his little girl. But that‚Äôs just an assumption.

41,1ccbr25,AITA for not allowing an unknown step siblings to my sons birthday?,"I, 29 Female, have a 2.5 year old son who I am fighting to get back from CPS. But in 2023, when his second birthday was coming up, I was frantically getting things together and making sure people would be invited. Mostly family and those I trust to be around him. My dad's side of the family have always been toxic to me growing up so I knew I didn't want many of them coming to the party. 
I was very hesitant about inviting my biological father to the party. When CPS was looking for a family member to place my son with, he wanted to be the foster family for my son. Instead of him getting picked, it was my sister in law who became my son's foster family. Part of it was due to me telling CPS I would rather my sister in law to be the foster parent instead of my biological father. Another part is because his home wasn't clean enough and didn't have enough room for my son to live there.
When my biological father found out my sister in law got him, he and his side of the family went balistic. My aunt even called my sister in law threatening to get a lawyer to sue her and so much more to the point that my sister in law backed out. My mom and I had to talk to my sister in law in order for her to agree again.
I was scared that if my biological father came to the party, then he would start problems and ruin the party for my son. My sister in law told me that if he did, her husband would be there to back me up if I choose to tell him to leave. Knowing her husband had my back, I decided to take the chance and invite my biological father and his new family. So it would have been him, his wife, and his 2 new step kids. They said they would love to come.
Well about a week before my son's birthday, my biological father calls and says he invited his wife's step daughter, from a previous marriage, and her husband to the birthday party. This was the first time I have EVER heard of this person. My father had been married to his current wife for 2 years at this point. I only knew about the two younger kids who are now my new step sisters. So it was a surprise to find out that there is another that NO ONE knew about. I had talked about this to my sister in law who was helping me plan this party for my son as well as my CPS worker. They both agree that if I do not personally know this person, then they should not come.
I texted my biological father the responses I had received and told him I even agree with them. He then messaged back basically going off about my sister in law. Saying that she has a problem with his new family and is being rude about it, basically calling her a bitch and that this person is family. In the end, I told him that I have to follow CPS rules if I want to get my son back. He didn't say anything after that.

42,1ccbowe,AITA for not lining up my freelance work with my roommate's work hours?,"Just over two months ago, i started my own e-commerce business. My father passed away, so i'm selling his inventory, and there's enough to justify an LLC. It's no huge operation, and since it's not really booming, every day or 2 i go to where my inventory is located, package, ship, and upload new inventory/handle book keeping. Hardly takes 3 hours. I work my regular job as well, which ends at 3:30pm each day, so to keep my routine consistent i do this at 4pm, regardless of whether i worked my main job that day.

My roommate(27f) has been getting upset that i'm not at home when she's on her way home. I've tried to talk to her about why it upsets her, and she got defensive/didn't give an actual answer, so i dropped it. Yesterday, she picked me up from work, and before she got there i told her that i was gonna change at home then walk over to work on the LLC since it's only a 5 minute walk from home. she suddenly insisted on stopping to pick up dinner, and it ended up taking so long that i missed post office hours. i told her no worries, i'd go do it today. 

Today, i started shipping at 4 as usual, and she called and asked if i was at home. When i told her that i was shipping, she snapped at me (""goddammit, seriously dude?!""). I reminded her that i gave her a heads up, and she got angry because she ""thought i'd do it earlier in the day."" When i tried to bring up that i do it at 4 to keep a routine, she cut me off and hung up on me.

She's also been a bit hostile with me over small things over the last few months, which i, admittedly, haven't voiced my upset about. Things like her cutting me off/getting defensive when i try to talk about various things, her going on about her day at work for an hour or so and then not letting me speak about my own for even 5 minutes afterwards without getting irritated with me for yapping, not knowing she wanted me to do things she never communicated, not noticing when we run out of things only she uses, constant criticism over small things etc. She's been my best friend for 12 years, and it's like a switch got flipped and suddenly she gets angry with me over every little thing.

It's upsetting, because i feel unsupported by my best friend. All of the other little things aside, all of the money my business makes that isn't going back into it or my father's headstone costs is going towards paying our bills. It's not like i'm hoarding/hiding money from her, because i'm using it on our shared expenses to take some of the burden off of her because i have the means to do so right now. I'd also like to add on that, while she is my best friend and roommate, she and i are not in a relationship. She has somebody she's seeing, so it's not a jealous lover situation because we aren't dating in the first place. 

I feel like i'm missing some bit of unspoken information that should be obvious but isn't. I don't want her to be upset with me.

43,1ccbnai,WIBTA if I kept my dog?,"Background: I'm not child-free by choice, but I had to get my reproductive organs removed when I was relatively young because of a genetic condition. I have never been in a stable place to adopt children, in no small part due to massive health events every few years since I was 26.

I love dogs, especially my 13+ year-old puppy, Bella. I got Bella from her litter and she was instantly my soul-dog. I had gotten my father a male puppy, Dash, a month prior, and they grew up as lifemates. My father and I would swap weeks when each of us would take both dogs so they could stay together, even though it hurt when it wasn't my week. When I had to escape a DV situation, I could not find shelter that would let me keep my dogs. I ended up having to re-home my older dog, who is forever since in the wind, but Bella went to my father's house for a few years until Dash got cancer. When he started his final decline, my dad felt too guilty looking at Bella, and I was finally in a living situation I could keep a dog. A few months after Dash died, my dad said he could take Bella back. Bella did not follow him when he called and leaned against my legs to show she was staying with me. My dad acknowledged she had opinions and let her stay with me.

A couple years later, I got cancer. The chemo was more intense than most other chemos, and when I got really sick, I twice missed picking up poos in the yard in areas I couldn't see. The management company sent a letter to my roommate, and she regretfully told me I had to get rid of Bella. My dad had just moved two hours away from the city, but I asked him to come get Bella. More than any of the treatments, not having her support and love broke me. After a couple months, my father called to tell me Bella needed to stay with him and his dogs because she has a happy life out in the country.

I'm in remission now, but I've lost pretty much all joy and motivation in life.

My therapist recently offered to write me a rec for an Emotional Support Animal. I'm currently living in my childhood home, but have been blocked over and over from getting a new dog by circumstance or my mother's fear (she knows I need a dog and agrees I should have one, but has fear about everything and makes up a million excuses not to adopt each puppy I've found). This week, I convinced my father to let me have Bella for a week, as my mother is away and I will be lonely (currently recovering from a broken foot and a respiratory illness) on the property by myself.

I've kept her before for a week or two here and there when my mother travels, but Bella usually goes into my dad's truck when he comes to get her. This past weekend, my father came to a holiday party I was hosting. After the party, he asked Bella if she wanted to go home (to his), and again she refused to follow him and leaned against my legs.

My mom wants me to keep the peace and offered to pay me to watch the kids and let my sister think she won. I'm thinking about it. But my sister still thinks I did it on purpose.",0.0,0.0002223679330199957,0,1

I have seen this happen many times and will admit it is disruptive. It upsets Clara that she is not taken seriously despite being the one with most experience and Emma was explicitly told that Clara is team lead. 

I tried to chalk it up to Emma being embarrassed about needing help and that Clara shouldn‚Äôt get too worked up over it. Then Clara started on this tangent about how it‚Äôs always followed her wherever she goes (previous workplaces, past relationships, university) that no-one takes her seriously because she looks very young and she felt it was repeating in this workplace too.

At this point I didn‚Äôt really know what to say because she was essentially accusing Emma of being sexist despite knowing her for a few weeks so I tried to lighten the mood by telling her she should be flattered about looking so young and we‚Äôll all look like we‚Äôre 60+ before she even turns 30.

47,1ccb3b5,AITA for not taking an interest in SO's hobbies,"My boyfriend has recently brought up that he feels I don't take enough interest in his hobbies - primarily tennis & golf. We have been dating for 3.5 years and been long distance for the last year. When we lived in the same country we played tennis together a few times but he says I always said no to his suggestion that we play together. I honestly don't remember him asking me that often but feel that maybe he stopped asking after I turned him down a few times.

I have sat and watched golf on TV with him and tennis highlights. I always ask him how his tennis matches go and have since learned loads more about golf, even watching it without him so I can talk about it with him. I have made an effort to learn who the various golfers and tennis players are that he likes/dislikes. He also took me to the driving range once and I loved it and would have been very open to going again.

I am not very sporty and have never previously had an interest in these sports other than watching the Wimbledon final on TV. He only brought up the issue in the last few months and I now feel super regretful that I rejected his suggestions to play tennis/golf when he was around as now I don't have the opportunity to do these things with him regularly due to distance. 

Am I the asshole for not attempting to participate more in his hobbies. I feel that he could have brought it up sooner when I could've proven to him that I would try to put more effort in with his interests.

Our fridge is usually close to empty. There‚Äôs always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that‚Äôs it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there‚Äôs nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there‚Äôs food at all but I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don‚Äôt make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I‚Äôm starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn‚Äôt even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I‚Äôm starving and haven‚Äôt eaten anything in over 24 hours.

Then she dramatically left the house saying she‚Äôs gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal.

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I‚Äôm the reason why she‚Äôs not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn‚Äôt the first time it‚Äôs happened.

Anyway, she steals my straightener when i‚Äôm awake too but this morning it was 6am and she thought I was asleep so she came into my room, full on ninja mode moving a millimeter at a time in order to get it. I told my mum and when she asked my sister my sister said it‚Äôs a cheap hair straightener anyway (which I thought was bad justification because I don‚Äôt even have a job and she does and just because my stuff is cheap doesn‚Äôt mean she can just take it when she pleases) and that she thought I was asleep and didn‚Äôt want to wake me. My mum basically got so angry at me, saying shes my sister and I have to share with her and that it‚Äôs just a hair straightener that she only didn‚Äôt ask because I was asleep, even though she never asks me when i‚Äôm awake. How am I even supposed to share when she just takes, never asks? My mother said most siblings don‚Äôt need to ask each other to use their things, and that‚Äôs only in share houses, but where was this energy when she thought I was stealing my sisters things? Anyway, my mother just told me I need to share and stop fighting over a hair straightener and leave her alone, but in my eyes it‚Äôs not about the hair straightener itself.

53,1ccafng,AITA for getting my niece disqualified for a job?,"Disclaimer: I am Indian, we refer to our cousins children as ‚Äúniece‚Äù and ‚Äúnephew‚Äù in our culture. 

I (26f) have 4 aunts. My aunts all have grown children in their 40s+. About 15 years ago, my parents divorced. Might seem  like no big deal, but **this is extremely taboo in our culture**, especially 15 years ago. Everyone in our community was gossiping about it - I remember walking to school one day and 2 grown men walking ahead of me were talking about how evil my mom was for leaving my deadbeat dad. 

3 of my aunts live outside of the country, 1 of them live in the same city, my mom helped them immigrate here in the early 2000‚Äôs. My aunt who lives here, has 2 adult children, and 1 of her children ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù (40something) has 2 children herself - a 16M and 22F. 

My cousin Crystal, along with my Aunt, were not really there for us while growing up. My mom was a single parent, working 12-16 hour days, 6 days a week, and had no support from anyone. In our culture, generally aunts and uncles help raise children, it‚Äôs very much so like a village. However - my mom had no help. Every time she asked for help or babysitting or anything (never money), they would have a million excuses on why they couldn‚Äôt help (they both stayed at home full time, never had any job). They treated us poorly growing up - with my sister and I always the butt of the joke because we were the fatherless girls with no family. My childhood was very lonely, and nothing like the childhood my friends from the same background/culture had. It made me sad when I was younger, but I got over it as I got older. 

Present day - I don‚Äôt have a relationship with Crystal, her children, or my aunt. My mom still has a relationship with them, they see eachother a few times a year and talk on the phone every week or two. 

I work for the government, and the area of government I work in is very hard to get into. Theres a lot of ‚Äúnepotism‚Äù, and positions generally go to those who know someone that works there. I joined during a busy time and took a job at the very bottom and have worked up to more senior roles, and now make over 6 figures. 

Crystals daughter ‚ÄúEmma‚Äù recently applied to work at my job, and in her application, indicated she knew me and I referred her. When asked by our Talent dept, I said I didn‚Äôt know her and did not refer her. I don‚Äôt know Emma, I haven‚Äôt seen her since pre covid. I guess since Emma lied on her application, she will no longer be considered for any government roles. News got back to Crystal, and she was incredibly angry that I ‚Äúbanned‚Äù her daughter, aka my niece, from working in government and is going around telling other family members how could I do that to them, after their family has done SO much (??) for us. 

I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong - but some family members said I should have just gone with it and said I referred Emma because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just what family does.‚Äù

The thing is, I don't like him and I don't respect him. My Step-Dad, I'll call him Jon, was never a good man. Just like my real dad he was in and out of prison and when he was in prison I felt more free because my Mom wouldn't jump to his defense anytime he would cry and complain about me. 

You'd think with all the white knighting they had a good relationship? Not exactly. I don't think you see the issue here. They would argue 24/7 usually because of cheating. My Step-Dad is the one who accuses her of cheating and refuses to let her leave the room.

56,1cc9yan,AITA for getting upset because my bestfriend still follows up ex?,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting on here so please bare with me. 

I 21M (Bart), am upset because my (ex) best friend 21M (Chandler) is still following my ex-girlfriend 20F (Maria) on Instagram a year and a half since we broke up. I remember clearly asking Chandler to unfollow Maria when we first broke up, and I placed my trust in him to unfollow her and respect my boundaries. 

  
A couple of days ago before writing this post, my current girlfriend 21F (Chloe) saw Maria on her Instagram discovery page. Out of curiosity, Chloe clicked on Maria's profile and it showed that Chandler and Maria are following each other. Of course Chloe. being the angel that she is, told me. 

I quickly messaged Chandler and asked him if he can unfollow Maria because it makes me uncomfortable. 

(Context, Maria was part of the reason why I succumbed to depression and tried to unalive myself 4 times and went to the psych ward twice.)

Back to the topic, I asked Chandler nicely and calmly to unfollow her because it makes me uncomfortable knowing that someone who's so close to me (I've known Chandler for 7+ years now) still being in contact with a source of trauma that I would rather not be connected with anymore. 

He told me no and that it's rather childish for me to get upset over a situation like this, and that I just need to ""get over this"" situation. He also says that him and Maria share a trauma together and he doesn't want to unfriend her just because of a ""deep seeded hatred I have for her"". I don't by the way, I wish her the best in her life and her endeavors, but I just simply do not want people close to me to be connected such a traumatic past. I was rather upset and I felt extremely disrespected, and acted through emotions and told him that I can't keep the friendship going since he isn't willing to respect my wishes and boundaries that I've placed. 

(More context: I suffer from crippling anxiety and bi-polar disorder, and in the past whenever I would have a mental break down, I would feel like I was a horrible person and cut Chandler off from my life, which hurt him a lot, I'll take blame for that. And during these episodes, while dating Maria, she would call/contact Chandler and they would comfort each other during my episodes. I still carry so much guilt about my episodes to this day.)

I spiraled and almost unalive myself again that night, but my angel of a girlfriend Chloe pulled me out of that loop and saved me. I really respect her and love her for that. 

That next morning after everything has settled down and I was thinking with a clear head, I contacted Chandler. I asked if we can talk about the situation from the previous night. He didn't want to and said that this situation is my fault and that we are talking on his term/time.

He further states that if I ever want him to even consider talking to me about the situation, I need to get back on my meds. 

(Context!!: I got off my meds for about two months now due to the fact that it makes my brain fuzzy and my creative process is stunted because of the meds. I work in the fashion industry)

I just feel so stupid and crazy right now because I'm not sure if I'm TA or if he's TA. People around me are saying that I'm NTA, but the two people closest to Chandler and I are Jason and Jake. Jason and Jake don't want to take sides and give me a decisive answer so I just feel so confused right now.

We went through couples therapy for about three years (in which both of us reflected on how our relationship had been before and tried to fix all that).   
Therapy made our relationship stronger, but after a few years (in which I had - and still have - to deal with some serious mental health problems), we started getting apart. I must stress here that I acknowledge the heavy burden she had to withstand because, for a long time, I had no condition of being either a decent partner or a lover.

Since a few years ago, I have been feeling much better, recovered a lot (still struggling a little), and resumed sharing our lives and taking care of the kids again.

A few weeks ago, she got in contact with an ex-boyfriend that she had not talked with for 30 years. They started messaging each other a lot, and I noticed she talked about some very intimate stuff related to our relationship (I oversaw some screens from her Messenger app). I didn't tell her that I had some idea of their talking, but when I confronted her, she said that she had a history before me, that talking to the guy had nothing to do with us, and that the guy knew different aspects of her and she liked talking about that. 

I am thinking about asking her to completely cut off contact with him because that makes me very, very insecure, and I am getting very anxious about that. Would I be an asshole if I asked her that, or asked her to show all of the talks they are having?

I didn't tell her that I had some idea of their talking, but when I confronted her, she said that she had a history before me, that talking to the guy had nothing to do with us, and that the guy knew different aspects of her and she liked talking about that. 

I am thinking about asking her to completely cut off contact with him because that makes me very, very insecure, and I am getting very anxious about that. Would I be an asshole if I asked her that, or asked her to show all of the talks they are having?

While catching up with friends after the trip, my wife's sister-in-law was asking about what we did on the trip, and we talked about site-seeing and then the dinners. I showed some pictures from our highlight dinner, and the SIL commented on how it looked expensive. 

I said it was on par with a typical Michelin experience. Then I shared, ""And we splurged on the wine for the night. Going with the 500 euro bottle was actually less expensive than the pairing.""

I didn't get the reaction of the SIL, and she asked, ""What's a typical Michelin experience?"" 

So I rambled about how it was a 3-star restaurant, and the tasting menu was about 300 euro per person, but you can go to a place with few stars and pay less, etc. 

The afternoon went on as normal, but my brother-in-law (wife's brother) pulled her aside at the end of the event. My wife told me that I had made his wife feel stupid and inferior because she wasn't aware of Michelin, nor of the cost. 

They aren't poor, but my wife and I are much more well off, and apparently it's always been an issue when we get together.

In middle school she started and on and off relationship with one of her friends, we'll call her Lexi. Lexi got expelled in the 6th grade and had to move but her and Sarah stayed in touch but weren't really together anymore. Sahara had some pretty messed up relationships in highschool (like when she was in 7th grade there was this thing with 4 senior guys) back in 2019 Sahara told me her and Lexi got back together, initially I didn't like this because at the time I was pretty homophobic but have since gotten past that. They started seeing each other a lot, hanging out, going on dates, all while Sahara was in the glass closet if you will. Admittedly I had never seen Sahara happier but she did struggle with a lot of self esteem issues and she'd constantly ask me if I thought Lexi was pretending to love her.
The two of them planned their future together, college, jobs, wedding, adopting, ECT. In mid February Lexi broke up with Sahara over text saying that she has been wanting to do that for a long time even though they had just spent a week at Christmas together and Lexi had supposedly not seemed any different than her ""usual cuddly self"" as Shara put it. Sahara has been in the worst place I've seen her in a long time. All she does is go to school and work and her sister-in-law (a mutual friend) says they have to make her eat. She has started wearing more makeup but given the context I don't know if that's a positive? Sahara is one of those people who just doesn't like anything about themselves. She hates her looks, her voice, her personality, you name it. She had started getting a bit better though. 
I called her two weeks ago to check in and she said she had just gotten off the phone with Lexi. They had been talking for SIX HOURS. All she talked about was Lexi. Lexi's new boyfriend, Lexi is going to prom, she's going dress shopping and getting her hair and nails done and all that stuff. Sahara sounded excited but I could literally tell she was crying.

This made me so so mad. I acted natural while on the phone but the next day at school I just let out all of my Lexi centered frustration to my friends.
 I admit I said some pretty harsh stuff about how much I hated Lexi. One of our mutual friends told Sahara what I had said and she got pretty upset with me.

Fast forward 10 years of me starting to live alone, college, job, etc., I decided to change direction and started a completely different field of study at university and am now living back home temporarily (till I find a new place). 
Now, I‚Äôve been struggling with my studies as this is a completely new field to me and I am essentially starting from zero. I thought I needed some emotional support so this evening I went to the living room where my parents were at and started talking a bit about university life, me feeling like I am not living up to my own expectations, yknow, the usual stuff when one is confronted with existential dread. 
Long story short, In the conversation I dropped the line ‚ÄúMaybe I am just too stupid for this‚Äù without thinking much about it and my father, who during the conversation was constantly questioning my decisions, saying the usual stuff like how I could drop future job prospects, not yet be married, etc., jumped on this one and said ‚Äúwhat do you mean you are stupid? I thought you were really smart, no?‚Äù which prompted me to just say goodnight and go upstairs to my room.
A few minutes later my mother called me on the phone and told me to come downstairs and apologize to my father since he was sulking because of the way I dealt with this and that I should also consider all the good things he has done for me.
Honestly, I am furious with my mother and almost laughably hysteric about this behaviour from my father, who is supposed to be an ‚Äúadult‚Äù. From my POV bro just fired shots at me for a thing from years ago to which I already apologized. But this whole situation has me very emotionally loaded for some reason, so idk really.

68,1cc8tbp,AITA for asking my blind boyfriend to pay for half of the monthly parking cost for my car?,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) is legally blind and cannot drive. We are currently living in a city which is safe and walkable. A parking spot for my car is included in our rent. We both take the bus to work, so mostly I use my car for errands. I drive us to visit his friends and family that are not accessible by public transit.

Towards the end of our lease, he told me he wasn't happy living in our current city, and he wanted to move to  a nearby bigger city for the following reasons:

* He wants to be closer to work and the train, which he uses to get around and visit friends. In our current city, he has to take a 15-20 minute bus ride to get to the train but would prefer to live somewhere he can walk to it. He hates the bus. Also, if we moved to the downtown area of this bigger city we could both walk to work.
* He feels that our current city is boring. He said there is nothing to do, and the downtown area with a theater, bars and restaurants is too far away (1 mile). 
* He wants an apartment with amenities like a dishwasher, A/C, and an in-unit washer/dryer. It's not always easy to find units that have been renovated with all these amenities in our current city because the buildings are older. In the bigger city, there are a lot of newer buildings. 

I had the following reservations about moving to the bigger city:

* The area he wants to live in is not safe. I would not be able to take a walk in my own neighborhood. When we have friends over their cars will be at risk of break ins.
* The apartments are expensive. We will need to take on a roommate. I had hoped to be done with roommates and I will miss our privacy. Even with the roommate we will both be paying more in rent.
* You almost always pay extra for a parking spot. We are looking at a building where a spot is $175/month.

Despite my reservations, I agreed to move to the bigger city. He is the one living with a disability, and easy walking access to the train means independence to him. If I want to take a walk or visit my old city it's only a 15 minute drive away. I decided that it would be fair to ask my boyfriend to split the cost of the parking spot with me for the following reasons:

* We both benefit from me having a car.
* I'm making compromises on what I value in a living situation to make him more comfortable, spending more money to live somewhere I like less.
* I am only asking for help with parking because that cost is directly related to this move. I've never asked him to contribute to anything else car-related. 

I asked him if he would consider contributing to parking. He gave me a cold look and said no. Immediately, I felt so embarrassed and greedy for even asking. I apologized and didn't even try to defend why I thought it might be fair.

However, I can't shake the feeling that it wasn't such a crazy request.

My (29F) boyfriend (30M) is legally blind and cannot drive. We are currently living in a city which is safe and walkable. A parking spot for my car is included in our rent. We both take the bus to work, so mostly I use my car for errands. I drive us to visit his friends and family that are not accessible by public transit.

Towards the end of our lease, he told me he wasn't happy living in our current city, and he wanted to move to  a nearby bigger city for the following reasons:

* He wants to be closer to work and the train, which he uses to get around and visit friends. In our current city, he has to take a 15-20 minute bus ride to get to the train but would prefer to live somewhere he can walk to it. He hates the bus. Also, if we moved to the downtown area of this bigger city we could both walk to work.
* He feels that our current city is boring. He said there is nothing to do, and the downtown area with a theater, bars and restaurants is too far away (1 mile). 
* He wants an apartment with amenities like a dishwasher, A/C, and an in-unit washer/dryer. It's not always easy to find units that have been renovated with all these amenities in our current city because the buildings are older. In the bigger city, there are a lot of newer buildings.

71,1cc8md2,AITAH Coming home late while out with friends,"Hi. I'm going to keep this one pretty open ended.

Lisa: WFH partner
Scott: Closing shift partner.

Lisa worked their 9-5, came and hung out at the restaurant that SCott works at. Lisa went home around 10pm or so, Scott said they were closing a bit after that and would go get a drink with coworkers.

Lisa goes to bed. At 12:43, they text Scott ""How late do you think you'll be?""

At 1:30 am, Lisa follows up with ""any idea""

Scott says
""Are you okay?
We're at a bar we all just closed out though
Not sure what's next
But are you okay""

Lisa ""Im okay. Alright Ill see you tomorrow""

Scott ""Are you upset""

Lisa ""Im ok. Im literally just in bed trying to sleep. I just kept waking up. Thats all""


At 3 AM, Scott is still not home.

Lisa sends ""How late do you think you'll be. It's 3 on a tuesday""

Scott, 10 minutes later. ""Baby I don't know late, I'm with friends we're hanging out""

Lisa, ""I'm beginning to get concerned.""

At this point it escalated with both people upset.


Is Lisa or Scott being an asshole, or neither, or both?

Lisa thinks Scott is being inconsiderate and evasive and defensive.
Scott thinks Lisa is being manipulative and controlling.

Additional clarity: Scott regularly works closing shifts and frequently goes out after for a few drinks with coworkers. This is not inherently a problem for Lisa in this scenario, although it does happen more regularly on friday/saturday shifts than tuesdays.

She has this habit where she won't like the way I have my things in my area organized or she'll buy me new things without warning.

I always tell her that I like my things the way that they are and I don't want them moved. I struggle with memory so if something is out of sight or it's designated spot I forget about it. I don't know why I hate my things moved so much but it stresses me out to the point of crying everytime. 

Today I came home from school and instead of my regular two drawers I have in my area in the living room I had a new bigger one in its place.

I always tell her that I like my things the way that they are and I don't want them moved. I struggle with memory so if something is out of sight or it's designated spot I forget about it. I don't know why I hate my things moved so much but it stresses me out to the point of crying everytime.

78,1cc7ujd,AITA for adopting a kitten?,"On phone, sorry for formatting.

I have been wanting to get a kitten for a few months - and it‚Äôs finally kitten time where I live. Yesterday I went online and saw some kittens on the shelter website - there was one in particular that I thought was adorable and would fit my lifestyle perfectly. When I arrived at the shelter, a couple was looking at the kitten I was most interested in so I went to look at the other kittens and older cats. 

After a few minutes I noticed they had moved on from her and so I approached the cage and started to get a feel for the kittens personality. Everything about her was exactly what I had hoped for; but to be polite I asked the couple if they were interested in her since they were still nearby. They said no, they were actually there to look at dogs and had stopped by the cattery to just pet the felines. They were going to ask to see her in a visiting room just to let her out of the cage, but had no intention of adopting her. I thought ‚Äúperfect!‚Äù I asked to see the kitten out of the cage and after a few minutes of one-on-one with her, I knew she was the one. So I went forward with the adoption. The couple followed up with me after I left the visiting room asking if I was interested in adopting her. I said yes, and they both seemed very happy for both of us. They left to see the dogs and I went to the front desk to fill out the adoption paperwork.

This morning I woke up to a post on the local Facebook page for cats/kittens looking for homes from the girlfriend in the couple, basically saying to ‚Äúnot steal‚Äù someone‚Äôs kitten when they were interested in adopting. I feel bad because I genuinely didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äústeal‚Äù someone else‚Äôs first choice. If they had said yes they were interested in the kitten, I would‚Äôve moved on and focused on a different cat or just left to wait for another one that would fit in with me.

When I picked her up, we went to InNOut because she didn‚Äôt have it in her state and wanted to try it, and asked me to pay.

84,1cc7bh9,WIBTA for not attending my grandfather's 90th birthday?,"My (27GQ) gpa (89M) is an adult 2-year-old. Most of my memories of this man have been ones where he is throwing some sort of tantrum, I'll elaborate more on this later on.

The party is in Germany and I live in the Western part of the USA. However, travel costs aren't an issue because my parents and my gpa are offering to pay for the tickets.

Everyone in my family says I have to go, ""it's family,"" while all my friends say, ""fuck your gpa, don't go.""

This is just really complicated and I don't know if all this stuff I'm about to list even validates not wanting to go to this man's birthday.

Here are the tantrums I've experienced with him:

* He yelled at my father (his son) in the middle of a busy crowd because he was tired (4 months ago)
* Got mad at me because I didn't call him on my birthday. (1 year ago)
* Told me that he didn't care if I wanted to be childless but, upon hearing I wanted to be a foster parent, called me selfish and lazy for ""ending the family line."" He also added, ""Those children will never love you and you won't love them as much as you would a biological child"" (2 years ago)
* Told me he may ""forget to put me in his will"" if I didn't call him more. (he has never called me)
* His reactions after my parents put him in a 5-star hotel instead of our house during my coming of age ceremony (I was 13)
   * Purposely came to a restaurant we were at just to walk out when I tried to call him over
   * During that part of the ceremony where I honor him, he refused to leave the bar and had to be dragged up to the stage. He was not drunk, he was drinking water.

Here are some general AH things he does and says:

* Questions everything I say and shows visible upset if I do something better than him or any man in the vicinity. (ex: Family was doing archery, he asked who had the most bullseyes with a big smile, my dad said I did with 5 while he and my bro had 0, grandpa's smile immediately dropped, didn't say anything to me or acknowledge what was said)

Things I've heard he's done:

* Cheat on my gma then blame her leaving him on the ""feminist books"" she was reading
* Try to get his mom to sign a change in her will to leave him either everything or most of everything while she was hours from dying and very drugged up.
* Many, many other times of just verbally abusing my dad

Again, I don't know if any of what I've listed are valid reasons to skip out on this man's birthday or if I'm just being petty. WIBTA if I skipped out on the celebration?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-24,"WIBTA for not attending my grandfather's 90th birthday? My (27GQ) gpa (89M) is an adult 2-year-old. Most of my memories of this man have been ones where he is throwing some sort of tantrum, I'll elaborate more on this later on.

The party is in Germany and I live in the Western part of the USA. However, travel costs aren't an issue because my parents and my gpa are offering to pay for the tickets.

Everyone in my family says I have to go, ""it's family,"" while all my friends say, ""fuck your gpa, don't go.""

This is just really complicated and I don't know if all this stuff I'm about to list even validates not wanting to go to this man's birthday.

Here are the tantrums I've experienced with him:

* He yelled at my father (his son) in the middle of a busy crowd because he was tired (4 months ago)
* Got mad at me because I didn't call him on my birthday. (1 year ago)
* Told me that he didn't care if I wanted to be childless but, upon hearing I wanted to be a foster parent, called me selfish and lazy for ""ending the family line."" He also added, ""Those children will never love you and you won't love them as much as you would a biological child"" (2 years ago)
* Told me he may ""forget to put me in his will"" if I didn't call him more. (he has never called me)
* His reactions after my parents put him in a 5-star hotel instead of our house during my coming of age ceremony (I was 13)
   * Purposely came to a restaurant we were at just to walk out when I tried to call him over
   * During that part of the ceremony where I honor him, he refused to leave the bar and had to be dragged up to the stage. He was not drunk, he was drinking water.

Here are some general AH things he does and says:

* He would ask my brother and me what we're doing in life, won‚Äôt acknowledge what we say, and goes on to talk about his step-gson who became an actual self-made billionaire. Does this multiple times a day when we're near him.
* Still uses phrases like ""Indian Giver."" My mom, brother, and I might not be Native American but we are Filipino, it's still uncomfortable.

85,1cc798r,AITA for threatening legal action against a handyman?,"To summarize, I own a rental property that was almost completely destroyed in a natural disaster last year, and I am in the process of a complete remodel.

Another contractor that was doing demolition work recommended a handyman for some A/C work. I met with the handyman, who we'll call Tom, and had them do a small bit of work on the existing A/C unit. After inspecting the unit Tom said it was very old and needed to be replaced. On 12/26/23 I agreed to have Tom replace the old A/C unit and against better judgement, I paid Tom $2,800 for a deposit on the equipment.

Construction delays ensued, and so the property wasn't ready for the A/C until 4/15/24. I texted Tom to let them know on 4/3/24 we would be ready soon. Tom responded with a simple ""Sounds good"". I texted Tom again on 4/12/24 to confirm. Tom responded again with one word: ""Great!"". On 4/15/24 after not hearing anything else I texted Tom again to confirm. Tom texted back and said they were busy and that it would ""prob be Wed \[4/17/24\].""

4/17/24 no call, no show, no A/C. I texted Tom again, they responded ""Yes sir trying to get caught up."" I texted Tom again for a date certain, no response. I start to get worried. I talked to an attorney, who suggested that I give Tom an ultimatum I and threaten legal action. Another week goes by without a response, so over the past few days I sent Tom several more escalating text messages, culminated by today's text that basically said ""if you're too busy to finish the work I understand but please either text me back and let me know what's going on, deliver the equipment I paid for, or please refund my $2,800 or I will be forced to take legal action.""

About an hour later Tom finally calls me, furious, and basically told me that they will not deliver the equipment, they will not refund my money, but that they will install the A/C unit whenever they get around to it. The logic being they have been waiting on me for 3 months to install the A/C, and now that I am ready for the A/C I am ""rushing"" them, I still owe them some $$$ for a small job they did previously (I agreed to pay them when they finished the A/C installation, which I had forgotten), and have threatened them with legal action. So as a result, they will intentionally delay the installation. Tom also made a vague threat that if I took legal action against them that ""it would not end well for me.""

I feel like I may have escalated things a bit too quickly after going back over the timeline and judging by Tom's reaction, but it's not like they were just sitting home losing money while we got the other phases of the remodel finished, they had not at any point asked to be paid for the previous work (I admit I forgot I owed them for this), and they not been communicating well if at all, and now they are holding me hostage.

86,1cc72lu,AITA for refusing to help my former teacher with their thesis?,"In late 2016, I (26F) took on a project to help out a teacher who was also a PhD student with the references for their thesis.

The pitch was that as they finished their chapters, I would take their notes, search, and document their references in the right style. I took it on at the time because I was desperate for cash, and it worked out ‚Äì for a while.

Here's the problem: it's still going. It's been EIGHT years! And as far as I know, they're not finished with their thesis. Look at my age vs when I started. I entered adulthood working on this. I've moved out of my parents' house. I could be married with kids before they're done.

Now, mind you, I had only been paid once for what was basically two years of off-and-on work. I got a payment in 2018 for the prior two years and haven't received any money since. And yes, I acknowledge that I should have spoken up about this.

I pay all my own bills such as my car, car insurance, phone bill etc and the money i have left means i can go out. 

Ive adressed this issue many times now to her and everytime its a big argument resulting in me being ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù.

ive been looking after them. Such as now my mums went on a solo trip meaning im having to look after them everyday get them up for school, take them to school, go to work and then look after them at night also. 

Ive saved her alot of money on babysitting fees just to be called selfish so i brung up the fact of if you want me to look after them all the time im going to start charging you not alot but it means i have extra money to do things i want to do or buy things i want to buy. 

She didnt take this well and again i was selfish and she wouldnt be asking me to watch them again if im going to act like that‚Ä¶ then the guilt hit me and ive continued watching them for nothing and not being able to go out.

91,1cc6gxd,AITA for joking about a small accident my friends roommate did?,"Recently me and my friend went to watch a hockey game in Montreal. While the game was going on, my friend received a call from his roommate who while intoxicated wanted to fix some problems with their apartment. Although they had good intentions, they broke the top cover that‚Äôs on top of the water storage behind the toilet while trying to put it elsewhere and dropped it on the ground. His roommate was fine and didn‚Äôt get hurt but they had that top part missing and since they had a cat they didn‚Äôt want it to just stay open like that. So the next weekend since their car didn‚Äôt have enough space for a boxed toilet and mine did, we went all together to get them a new toilet.

Now here is where i think I might be the asshole. Across the day, to lighten up the mood of their broken toilet and the fact they broke it i tried making a few jokes on the subject as for exemple: while we opened the new toilet i gave them the cardboard box telling them they were allowed to drop that part or i said that at least if they break the body of the toilet next time they have a spare.

So am i the asshole?",Asshole,2024-04-24,"AITA for joking about a small accident my friends roommate did? Recently me and my friend went to watch a hockey game in Montreal. While the game was going on, my friend received a call from his roommate who while intoxicated wanted to fix some problems with their apartment. Although they had good intentions, they broke the top cover that‚Äôs on top of the water storage behind the toilet while trying to put it elsewhere and dropped it on the ground. His roommate was fine and didn‚Äôt get hurt but they had that top part missing and since they had a cat they didn‚Äôt want it to just stay open like that. So the next weekend since their car didn‚Äôt have enough space for a boxed toilet and mine did, we went all together to get them a new toilet.

Now here is where i think I might be the asshole. Across the day, to lighten up the mood of their broken toilet and the fact they broke it i tried making a few jokes on the subject as for exemple: while we opened the new toilet i gave them the cardboard box telling them they were allowed to drop that part or i said that at least if they break the body of the toilet next time they have a spare.

92,1cc66x5,AITA for not pitching in to fix a wall at my apartment? ,"I live in an apartment which I share with 3 roomates. I live in the master bedroom which is pretty big,l. As soon as I moved in I installed my TV in my room since i spend alotoftimethere, the installation, provided by my landlord cost me 30 bucks.  

One day one of our roomies, well call her dani, mentioned that her mom amd dad came  over and that the silence in the living room was super awkward  and that our landlord offered her a TV they had lying around. It had no cost, we just had to assume the instalation cost. When it was installed  they charged 45, when I asked why it was more expensive when he charged me 30 last time, he said that they had to take the TV down from where it was before and it damaged the wall so they charged 15 more for the repair. If we split the cost by 4 we only had to pay 11.25 a piece, not bad.

I paid the guy and told my roommates to pay me whenever they could. Only dani paid, so I lost 33.75,  which I let go of, wasn't gonna make a big deal out of that. 

Now, a few months later, the landlord asked for the TV back, we agreed  since no one was really, using it. When they un installed it, of course there were holes in the wall and also the pvc cable covers peeled the paint so it damaged a bigger part. 

Now they are charging 80 for the repair and they want me to pitch in 20. I disagree completely... I never needed the TV because I have my own, plus I'm already out 33 bucks from the installation.

In my opinion the landlord should be paying for it because he requested it to be taken down. We assumed the $15 surcharge for repairing the installation from the previous home so I feel he should do the same. 

He says he will give 30, and we pay 50. 

Our other roomie, nelly, says she will only pay 10, shes never home cause shes with her boyfriend and doesnt have a job,  so she doesn't believe she has to pay. 

Im telling dani to figure it out, because i wont pay anything else.  I was out of a job three months and am broke as can be. I finally have a job and am paying off a bunch of debt, student debt plus money I borrowed for rent last month.

She paid 20 but says she can't afford more. I'm not budging though. 

Dani is a college student with parents that have money, ive seen her tell her parents she wants a purse, and they pay 150 dollars for it no problem. She always talks about how her pants cost 300 dollars and how she pays 20 bucks to have them dry cleaned.  I think she can afford 40 bucks. 

Am i being an AH?

93,1cc66iu,AITA for accusing my aunt of leaving my wedding out of spite.,"So here's a little background I was a single mum for six years my aunt was a big part of my life for that time before that was at uni and didn't have any if much contact. So I have my baby and I start seeing my aunt three times a week, kid goes to school aunt picks her up for me as I am at work. This was her offer. So I meet my future husband he loves me and loves my child as his own.

 He proposes and we start planning the wedding my aunt is still a massive part of my life and I want her involved. so we get to the day of the wedding and everyone is getting ready together I have multiple aunts but special aunt is the only one getting ready with the bridal party. All is going amazing everyone is having a great time.

 After the ceremony we have drinks and pictures the photographer has a list of important people for the photos special aunt is on the list (she was aware of this) Photographer call over myself, husband, child and both sets of parents to have photos done. The other important people  all wonder over on their own as they all know they will be called next apart from special aunt who is nowhere to be found. Turns out she left with her friend because of a broken shoe but didn't tell anyone. I was concerned when she didn't come over so myself and my siblings went looking for her she wasn't there. 

Due to this the photographer had moved on to the other photos we gave instructions for. Due to this I only have one photo of myself, husband and child on my wedding day that is formal. Special aunt comes back after two hours (she lives 10 minutes from venue) eats dinner and then sits away from everyone else for the rest of the day I finally corner her in the evening and take a picture with her, myself and my child which was supposed to be taken earlier in the day however she didn't smile in any of the five shots that was taken.

I was very upset when I saw my pictures and asked her for a reason she left and seemed unhappy and no response was given other than there was a broken shoe that needed to be fixed right then even though there was a three hour gap between ceremony and formal dinner. I was not happy with this and it turned into a argument, she became upset with me because I distanced my self from her which she doesn't understand I tried to explain why I was upset and she kept brushing it off like it wasn't important.

I think she left because she didnt get called with the first lot of important people,  she likes to make out that she gets left out of things and is not part of the family even though that has never been the case so i feel she left to make me feel bad on my wedding day. I can't let it go and it has affected the relationship to the point of nearly no contact. So am i the asshole for being upset with her for leaving my wedding without saying anything.

99,1cc4sne,AITA for taking my 50% share of a property?,"Hello, apologies in advance, this is complex.

My mother inherited a property from my paternal grandfather many years ago. It has remained empty since, as she has her own house. 2 years ago, my mother put my name on the deed so we jointly own the property. 

Last year, my husband and I planned to settle in the UK after having lived in the US for a year. In order to apply for a his visa, we had to prove we had suitable accommodation here in the UK. I spoke to my mother and asked if we could live in the house I jointly owned with her, as it was empty, and needed some serious tlc, which we would pay for. Having been empty for so long, it seemed like a no brainer. She said no problem, and signed a document for the visa stating that this would be our family home when we came back to the UK. 

We came back to the UK and my mum told me the house was a wedding gift for us, and we could raise our family in it and enjoy it. I took out a loan for a whole new central heating system coming in just under 9k, and took on all the bills for the property as soon as we moved in. 

 A couple of months passed and my mother said she didn‚Äôt want us to change any of the property without her permission. This was the first issue, as the property had no washing machine, an almost non functioning stove and oven, issues with electrics, most things needed replacing. She kept turning up to the house at all hours of the day, it seemed like she was trying to make sure we hadn‚Äôt changed anything without her knowing.

A few months later I became pregnant and told my mother. She told me that she wanted to take me off the deed, sell the house and use all the money herself to buy a house, as she is not happy in her current house. She now said she only put me on the deed in case anything happened to her. 

We moved out and are renting at the moment, as the place was not livable with a baby. And she wasn‚Äôt happy with us changing anything. I have continued paying the central heating loan I took out, and have kept the meter topped up. She has paid the council tax. They add up to around the same each month. 

My mother and I had a great relationship before this, so although I was upset, I kind of just thought in my head, she can have the house, I didn‚Äôt want the stress.

However, the issue now is, we are unable to get a mortgage on our own, as we have to rely solely on my income due to my husband‚Äôs foreign income. I am also not classed as a first time buyer now, further reducing my borrowing capacity. I have that large loan, and now have childcare taken into account. We have also had to pay for rent here, and moving costs to our rented home, which almost halved our deposit.

",Not the A-hole,2024-04-24,"AITA for taking my 50% share of a property? Hello, apologies in advance, this is complex.

My mother inherited a property from my paternal grandfather many years ago. It has remained empty since, as she has her own house. 2 years ago, my mother put my name on the deed so we jointly own the property. 

Last year, my husband and I planned to settle in the UK after having lived in the US for a year. In order to apply for a his visa, we had to prove we had suitable accommodation here in the UK. I spoke to my mother and asked if we could live in the house I jointly owned with her, as it was empty, and needed some serious tlc, which we would pay for. Having been empty for so long, it seemed like a no brainer. She said no problem, and signed a document for the visa stating that this would be our family home when we came back to the UK. 

We came back to the UK and my mum told me the house was a wedding gift for us, and we could raise our family in it and enjoy it. I took out a loan for a whole new central heating system coming in just under 9k, and took on all the bills for the property as soon as we moved in. 

 A couple of months passed and my mother said she didn‚Äôt want us to change any of the property without her permission. This was the first issue, as the property had no washing machine, an almost non functioning stove and oven, issues with electrics, most things needed replacing. She kept turning up to the house at all hours of the day, it seemed like she was trying to make sure we hadn‚Äôt changed anything without her knowing. We hadn‚Äôt changed anything, and agreed that we wouldn‚Äôt without discussion. 

A few months later I became pregnant and told my mother. She told me that she wanted to take me off the deed, sell the house and use all the money herself to buy a house, as she is not happy in her current house. She now said she only put me on the deed in case anything happened to her.

100,1cc4m65,AITA for not wanting to give Ex-Mother-in-law MY recipe,"My ex-husband (Jacob) and I lived with his Mom (Marry) and step-dad prior to us getting married and Jacob joining the military. I continued to live there while Jacob was in basic training. Marry and I did everything together at that point because her husband was away at this time too for deployment. 

I thought her and I had a great relationship but I found out that she had been writing Jacob and telling him things like not to sign power of attorney papers over to me, not to trust me... Jacob put her in her place eventually but I never really let my guard down with her after that.

And as you can imagine, this type of behavior from her was not an isolated incident. I managed to mirror her fakeness and we got along just fine for the 10 yrs my ex and I were married.

 Fast forward to last year when I had to take Jacob to court to have the custody agreement changed for the safety of our children. Jacob tried to keep Luke, our oldest, from being a part of the custody case because he was going to be 18 in less than 6 months and was going to be able to testify. Our other two children were under 10 and would not have as much of a voice because of their ages.

But the way my ex-in laws, the ENTIRE family has treated  Luke because he stood up for himself and his siblings makes my blood boil. Mary (Luke's grandmother) and Aunt telling him they couldn't or won't talk to him until court is over because they don't want to take sides. But they continued to visit and talk with his dad. They continue to make plans and never follow through with them even now and court ended in September 2023. Breaks my heart. 

The point of all this is, Mary (my ex mother-in-law and Luke's grandmother) text Luke a few days ago and wanted him to ask me for MY sweet potato casserole recipe. I was originally going to give it to her (people pleaser in me).

This is a dish of mine that is requested often when I'm invited to parties. I've had a few ways I'd like to respond to her request.... ""Goggle it"", it's not gonna be the same but it's as close as you'll ever get again...

 when i got home, i received a text from him explaining that he was uncomfortable because i had ‚Äúflat out‚Äù told him i was coming to his house and had not asked permission before. at this point, i was not surprised that he felt this way considering how uncomfortable he seemed when i had seen him.

Weve had this argument before but its coming to a head now. My boyfriend forgets everything that isnt to do with him and its driving me insane.

It was my 21st birthday a couple of months ago, we were supposed to go out for a few drinks cause I could and my boyfriend forgot to book the day off of work until the last day. He did get it off but it wasnt because of forethought, it was lucky that his work didn‚Äôt need him that day. I had reminded him multiple times to book it off, it was a day we would usually have work and he mentioned months before that he wanted to book it off so that he could enjoy himself, so its not like he didnt want to book it off. 

This caused one of our biggest arguments and ever since then I keep noticing how much he actually forgets. Im not his mom and I dont want to keep reminding him of things that are important to me. I even suggested he put a reminder on his phone so that he could actually remember and he said that he would but he still never does. 

I expressed to him about two weeks ago that I wanted to get flowers for a coworker of ours (we work in the same place) because she was leaving and shes acted like a m to us. I couldnt get them for her because we were on the same shift (I work 5am to 1pm) and so does she so I asked him to pick some up because he didnt start until 5pm and he said he would. I couldnt have brought them in with me because we work in fast food and I wouldnt have had anywhere to keep them. So, on the day I waited for him to come and drop the flowers off so that we could give them to her, he didn‚Äôt show. We argued the night before but I didnt think he would not do it because of the argument but when I asked him about it, he forgot. 

I went out for my friends 21st last night, which he knew about, and he said he would pick me up to make sure I got home safe and then drive me to work in the morning because I do early shifts and probably wouldnt have been able to drive myself. He forgot to pick me up and forgot to take me to work, so I was late to work because I had to walk (40 minutes). He also said he was going to pick me up from work since I didnt drive, he conveniently forgot again. So I walked home. Ive been short with him since the flower incident but I know hes not purposely not doing what he said he would, he just forgets. 

I know some people find it hard to remember things and I tried to offer a solution and expressed that it hurts my feelings that he forgets things that are important to me but his excuse was that ‚Äòhe is stressing about other things‚Äô (his career) which is obviously normal and that ‚Äòwe are two different people‚Äô (which we are) but he seems to forget that Im stressing about the same things he is and I still make time to remember things that are important to him but he just can‚Äôt seem to try and do the same thing for me.

106,1cc4e3g,WIBTA for airing out my families dirty laundry to everyone ?,"I don‚Äôt know how to exactly write this, so please bare with me‚Ä¶ 

My partner (M28) and I (F27) have been together 7 years, we have 2 kids together. 

At the start he was somewhat helpful, but as time has gone on, he‚Äôs become less present, less interested about being a dad. He‚Äôll sit in the bedroom playing games for hours, scrolling his phone, doing absolutely anything but be a parent. 
When he comes out, he‚Äôll sit on the couch glued to his phone. 

Recently we found out I‚Äôm pregnant again. I was so excited, until he turned around and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt expect any help from me‚Äù  now I dread having this baby. I can‚Äôt raise a 4th child on my own. Wrangle 3 kids on my own. 

So I‚Äôm thinking about Termination. But in comes the resentment. I hate that he can‚Äôt be enough of a dad to help out more, to play with his kids, get up every now and then so I can sleep in. I hate that I‚Äôm expected to do so much while he sits back and does nothing. 

I never wanted this. I wanted to always be able to keep every child I find out about. But I can‚Äôt. Because of him. 

We both work full time jobs, while he finishes at 3pm and can come home to a peaceful house and relax until me and the children get home at 5:30pm. But even then, hes hardly out of the room. He‚Äôll say hi to the kids and then off he goes to the bedroom. 

I‚Äôm ready to leave. I think this is my tipping point. I feel like a failure, I feel like I can‚Äôt have what I want and long for because he can‚Äôt step up enough. Because he‚Äôs not man enough. He just expects me to do it all and then some and not complain not argue, but still now down to his every want and need. 

Because of everything. I want to blow this up with his family. I want to scream it to the world. The reason we aren‚Äôt having this baby is because of him. Because he‚Äôs not supportive enough. Because he can‚Äôt step up. I know that would end the relationship but I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm run down. I have a fever and still get up at 5:30am, delirious and exhausted, to get up with the children because he won‚Äôt. He won‚Äôt even let me sleep in for 2 hours while I‚Äôm sick and pregnant. He‚Äôs a lazy slob. 

So WIBTA for airing out my families dirty laundry to all parties involved?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-24,"WIBTA for airing out my families dirty laundry to everyone ? I don‚Äôt know how to exactly write this, so please bare with me‚Ä¶ 

My partner (M28) and I (F27) have been together 7 years, we have 2 kids together. 

At the start he was somewhat helpful, but as time has gone on, he‚Äôs become less present, less interested about being a dad. He‚Äôll sit in the bedroom playing games for hours, scrolling his phone, doing absolutely anything but be a parent. 
When he comes out, he‚Äôll sit on the couch glued to his phone. 

Recently we found out I‚Äôm pregnant again. I was so excited, until he turned around and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt expect any help from me‚Äù  now I dread having this baby. I can‚Äôt raise a 4th child on my own. Wrangle 3 kids on my own. 

So I‚Äôm thinking about Termination. But in comes the resentment. I hate that he can‚Äôt be enough of a dad to help out more, to play with his kids, get up every now and then so I can sleep in. I hate that I‚Äôm expected to do so much while he sits back and does nothing. 

I never wanted this. I wanted to always be able to keep every child I find out about. But I can‚Äôt. Because of him. 

We both work full time jobs, while he finishes at 3pm and can come home to a peaceful house and relax until me and the children get home at 5:30pm. But even then, hes hardly out of the room. He‚Äôll say hi to the kids and then off he goes to the bedroom. 

I‚Äôm ready to leave. I think this is my tipping point. I feel like a failure, I feel like I can‚Äôt have what I want and long for because he can‚Äôt step up enough. Because he‚Äôs not man enough. He just expects me to do it all and then some and not complain not argue, but still now down to his every want and need. 

Because of everything. I want to blow this up with his family. I want to scream it to the world. The reason we aren‚Äôt having this baby is because of him. Because he‚Äôs not supportive enough. Because he can‚Äôt step up. I know that would end the relationship but I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm run down. I have a fever and still get up at 5:30am, delirious and exhausted, to get up with the children because he won‚Äôt. He won‚Äôt even let me sleep in for 2 hours while I‚Äôm sick and pregnant.

107,1cc4cje,AITA for trying to give my son his birth photos?,"I tried to give my son his birth photos and now he‚Äôs upset at me / won‚Äôt talk to me. 

Context: I (64F) have one child (31M) who I admit we spoiled‚Ä¶. We gave him everything- food, birthdays, paid for every activity and vacation. On paper, he‚Äôs a perfect son: did well in school, never got into trouble, visits often, sends flowers on my birthday / Mother‚Äôs Day. He even pays for a lot now that he‚Äôs working.

Still, he‚Äôs always acted extremely ungrateful considering all we‚Äôve done for him. I can tell he keeps me at a distance- calls maybe once a week at most, doesn‚Äôt share very much about his life when he does. When he visits, he‚Äôll do things like demand I turn down the TV if he‚Äôs doing something for work / studying not realizing this OUR place not his. Last year, my husband and I took him and his GF to a cabin for the weekend and, even though I paid for everything, he asked if he could take the larger room. The reason was he has a severe cat allergy (asthma) and that was the only room not covered in cat hair. Sure it made logical sense but it still seemed extremely rude since I paid for the whole trip.

Story: so he visited again for a week on his vacation which was nice but things soon started going south. For starters, he slept in EVERY morning. He preferred to sleep than spend that extra time with us. Great. He‚Äôs a medical resident and so I get he works a lot of hours but it still seemed very selfish. The second to last day he was here, my husband tried to wake him up around 6-7am to see if he would go with him to see his new workplace. My son basically just said no and went back to sleep. I was furious. He can‚Äôt even do this one thing for his dad who is proud of his new job? 

When he finally got up around 9am, I was very upset. He asked me why I was so angry and I told him. He got extremely defensive saying that he could just try to visit later in the day and he didn‚Äôt see what the big deal was. He just didn‚Äôt get it. It wasn‚Äôt the timing, it was that he didn‚Äôt seem to care enough to sacrifice his ‚Äúprecious sleep‚Äù to show his dad he cares. 

I got so angry that I went upstairs and got all his birth photos together and gave them to him in a plastic bag saying that I don‚Äôt want a son who is so ungrateful and can‚Äôt do the bare minimum for us. I kid you not, he basically laughed in my face and refused to take them saying I was overreacting. I was furious. I could tell he was also upset and he just said he couldn‚Äôt believe what I did (hello what about what YOU did?) and didn‚Äôt talk to me for the rest of the visit. He‚Äôs never behaved this rudely or talked back like this before. 

It‚Äôs been a month now and he‚Äôs still barely responding. I get that I maybe lost my temper but in my defense (1) they‚Äôre photos of him, (2) he hasn‚Äôt really shown us he appreciates us, and (3) it‚Äôs not like I was angry out of nowhere. My husband agrees with me. But my son still maintains what I did was wrong. AITA?

‚Äî
Edit: I am VERY surprised by the responses so far. Trust me there are far more examples of how he‚Äôs been ungrateful and disrespectful in the past but I won‚Äôt bother since it seems like I‚Äôve been judged. 

‚Äî
Edit: I want to clarify a few things based on the comments. (1) I was NOT saying I deserve a medal for FEEDING my child. My point was he has never wanted for anything and I have objectively been a good mother. This generation is sad because few of you appreciate that this isn‚Äôt always the case. (2) I am VERY proud of my son. Obviously he deserves to rest. I wrote this while angry and I see how my post came off as uncaring. But TO BE CLEAR: I DO NOT MIND he sleeps in. However, waking him up ONCE for something important is NOT abusive. If that‚Äôs what you think, I‚Äôm sorry but you have no idea what abuse is. (3) There‚Äôs a part of the story I should‚Äôve shared at the beginning. This started two years ago. He was on vacation again and we were visiting my mother who I had spent all day taking care of. FINALLY at around 1am I had a chance to do some sewing with my portable sewing machine. Not even time for myself, I was fixing something for the house. He comes out and demands that I put it away because it was waking him up. This is after he spent the ENTIRE DAY lounging and only helped with dinner. Not only that but after I calmly said no, he insisted I take the sewing machine somewhere else. Except unfortunately that area was the only one with lighting that worked for me. He just couldn‚Äôt let it go. He got incredibly angry and told me I was being unreasonable. He was a bully and I‚Äôll never forget that. Maybe I overreacted in telling him I was disowning him this time. Fine. But this has context and like I said this was NOT the first time he has bullied me into getting his way. 

Fine. I was an a**hole this time. I will take your advice and apologize for overreacting but I still think the MAJORITY of you did not understand the situation.

Recently, one morning our daughter couldn't find her hair tie, and my husband made a joke about a Brazilian folkloric figure who supposedly hides people's belongings. Intrigued, our daughter, who has always been interested in legends like wendigo and skinwalker, asked him to teach her more about it. Although he admitted he didn't know much, he offered to research further. Since then, it's become routine for them to discuss it, researching together and sharing stories (she evem print some imagens and articles about it and hung on her ""creepy board""). I wasn't concerned until I found out she was sharing her discoveries with her schoolmates. I don't want her to be considered the weirdo kid at school and asked if her friends were bullying her. She said some classmates made jokes, but she explained that are just legends, like every country has, and it was interesting to learn more about it. Still, I decided to ask my husband to stop encourage her to research Brazilian folklore anymore. To my surprise, he didn't like the idea, saying our daughter was finally showing interest in something Brazilian and he wouldn't stop her. After that, he acted strangely all day.

Or, since I make enough, should I just buy my own and just ask for something purposely chepa that I can still enjoy? Like wine or a potted plant?

Thank you in advance! The guilt is real.",0.0,1.0182877779006958,1,0
113,1cc3m2r,WIBTAH: If I don‚Äôt attend my BF‚Äôs sister‚Äôs birthday because i don‚Äôt want to pay $400 to sleep on a couch?,"Like i said, she‚Äôs planning a trip 3 hours away to stay at a cabin resort. They planned this very very last minute and just told my BF and I yesterday that it would cost around $400 for the two of us. We‚Äôre both college students so $5-600(total cost of trip) is A LOT to save up in 1 and 1/2 weeks.

In total, the cabin resort costs ~$1200. They charge PER PERSON. There are 9 of us total. His sister, her husband and their three kids. My Bf and I, and my Bf‚Äôs parents.

That already raised some red flags. Why are we paying $400 for two people, and they‚Äôre paying $400 for 5 people? Math isn‚Äôt adding up but I let it slide because it‚Äôs her birthday so whatever.

But then they showed us the cabin:
1 Queen sized bedroom
1 Bedroom with 2 bunk beds(4 beds total)
1 couch.

His sister and her husband are sharing the Queen bed, which means the kids, his parents, and us would share the room with twin bunk beds. NO THANK YOU. Fuck that. Absolutely fucking not. 

The other cabin option they gave us:
1 Queen Bed,
2 Twin Beds
2 Bunk Beds
1 Couch.

They get Queen bed, parents get twin beds and we get to choose between sleeping with 3 toddlers or on a couch. Again, Fuck that, no thank you.

3rd cabin option had the queen bed(her and her husband), 1 bunk bed(kids), and another room with a queen bed(his parents)with a ladder leading to two twin beds above it.(us)

Although that sounds like a MUCH better option (its $100 cheaper) than the two originally proposed, i still don‚Äôt understand or see the logic in all of us paying the exact same price to be sleeping in unfair sleep arrangements. Plus his parents are light sleepers and easily irritated by noise and talking at night so it would be awkward for us to sleep above them.

Not to mention the fact that i‚Äôm not even interested in going to the resort beyond hanging out with them. It‚Äôs mostly kid themed. So the 3 hour drive plus the costs, plus the sleeping arrangement is throwing me off.

Even if we stayed at a hotel and paid for park entrance and parking, it‚Äôs only $30-50 cheaper. Not really worth it. And my BF thinks theres no point in going if we‚Äôre not going to get the full experience. Plus, if we don‚Äôt go, his parents would have to pay $600 instead to cover the costs.

My BF still really wants to go and won‚Äôt go unless I do. So i feel guilty and pressured. WIBTAH if I don‚Äôt go?

116,1cc36n2,AITA for ignoring my mom when she trauma dumps?,"TL;DR, My mom keeps telling me the same stories about my dad being horrible father/husband. I'm tired of these stories and keep ignoring her when she intiates these conversations. AITA? 

My mother [F58] has an autoimmune disorder and is essentially stuck at home. She has no friends, doesn't really talk with her siblings, and her main person she talks to is me [F19]. I'm the only child who is still living at home. 

Ever since I was little, she would tell me how horrible my father [M60] was. That she wanted to divorce him, how he never cared for her, never helped raise any of us children even though she was physically unable to. When I was younger I was more gullible and believed her. Of course I didn't know it was trauma-dumping at the time and I would cry and beg her to not divorce my father. 

As of recent, I've gotten really close to my dad. I learned how much he struggled to cope with my mom's illness as he couldn't take away her pain. He eventually got stressed out seeing her bed-ridden and often times would go out to relieve his stress. I sympathize with him a lot now, because I primarily take care of my mother & the house (he works full time, so I do majority of the cooking & cleaning). He's told me he's trying to repair the bonds he's broken with my mother, but she won't let him fix them. It breaks his heart and I've seen it personally - he tries to be more affectionate, take her out to dinner, and she immediately rejects every advance. After that, I've lost all sympathy I ever had for her. 

However, my mom can't stop complaining about my dad even though he's trying to right his wrongs. She keeps telling me the same stories about him being a horrible father, having to raise me by ""herself"" (my sisters raised me, not her) and overall trying to guilt trip me. Recently I've been ignoring her because she won't stop talking about the same thing and responding with only ""Okay mom"" or by telling her ""I'm busy studying"". She walks away seeming a little bothered I'm not entertaining her.

118,1cc2zmv,AITA for not moving in with my dad because he won't respect my one boundary?,"Background:

My (21F) dad (56M) is currently divorcing his fourth wife, my step-mum (57F). They were together for a decade, and I saw her as a parental figure, but never called her mum. They separated around 8 months ago and now have their own flats.

For these 8 months, I have been most of my dad's emotional support. He'd call me and cry on the phone, in person, and over text. I've helped as much as I could, talked him through it, gave him advice, suggested finding new hobbies to expand his circle, all while trying to keep on top of my uni work and working part-time. Needless to say, my plate is full.

2 months ago, he told me he wanted to try and get back together with her. I told him that it probably wasn't a good idea, as at this time she had a new boyfriend, but they met up anyway. Apparently it was a very emotional talk and she still wanted to go through with the divorce, but that there was a chance of reconciliation. She told him she wanted to keep it a secret for 6 months to a year if they got back together - telling none of their respective kids. My dad told me anyway and I said that sounded suspicious. She then wanted him to sign papers without taking them to a solicitor, but I convinced him to anyway. I'm not 100% sure of the exact documents, but she lied about what the document was. Basically, if he had signed this she would have had access to his state pension. He said he would ""take her to the cleaners"" for that.

Well, 2 months later and they've blocked each other and ""reunited"" multiple times. They recently went on a weekend away togehter, he gave her his ring, she then blocked him. They're now seeing each other again and she will apparently be coming round to his flat often. Throughout all of this he's been confiding in me, including stuff I, as his daughter, really shouldn't know. I feel very overwhelmed by all of this, and at this point, I'm so tired of all the drama. He says he ""can't give up"" on her - at this point it's cringe-inducing. I asked him a few months ago if I could live with him for my third year of uni since rent is increasing. We talked about me paying him rent, came up with what we both thought was a fair sum, and agreed I could move in by July. All I asked that he let me know when she would be coming round so I could make myself scarce. I have no interest in having any sort of relationship with her after our family was separated. He agreed and guaranteed he would text me if she was coming.

Come to today, where not only does he inform me that she will be coming round without warning, but she will also be getting keys! I said I had one condition.

121,1cc263z,AITA for not taking the dog?,"Backstory before the story, I have always been scared of dogs and how they jump up on people. This started when I was attacked by a dog at a very young age. Current day, one of my gran's neighbours let their dog off the lead and it attacked another dog. The owner now wants to put it down but my family are wanting to take it in.

My granny and gran dad live together and already have a greyhound which I have grew up with and didn't have a choice. Since I had to grow up with it, I can deal with it and especially because its old and doesn't jump anymore nor bark. My mum wanted to take it in though since the greyhound and the other dog don't get along. My mum told me that it doesn't jump or bark so I said I would give it a chance if on a lead. When I went to the house instantly jump the dog   at my granny and granddad which made me walk back home alone by myself without my mum.

My mum lied to me and said it didn't when it did. I don't know what is going to happen now since my mum isn't home yet. Also I forgot to say that we would take the greyhound until it passes if my mum doesn't decide to keep it. To compromise I can't help being scared of dogs. AITA? (I will update after my mum is home saying what  is happening)

  
(Edit) it's the day after and the dog has went back with the owner. My family have not got any more news from the owner. Something that I didn't add yesterday was that the owner has done some really bad things to the dog before. Such as, let it off his lead and not let the dog come inside of his house. Luckily, the dog knows to go to my grannies if it needs anything so it did. That night me and my mum had to take the greyhound and my grandparents take the dog. P.S the man said he was drunk but that's still not an excuse to do that to a puppy. Although scared of the dog, it's still a living being that deserves to be loved by a real good owner. My family have opposed that maybe in the mer future once the greyhound has passed that they might take the dog in. I have stated to them that if they do and don't train it. I won't be coming to their house anymore. My auntie who also lives in the same town as us, has a dog and it is also one years old. My auntie, someone who I consider my best friend respects my fears and whenever I am over she put the dog in a crate in her room shut with some treats in the crate and some calm music.

123,1cc1thd,AITA for not cleaning up garbage in my neighbor's yard,"I live in a 2 flat with landlords in the other half, so it's important that I be a good neighbor, else I'd just roll my eyes at this and move on. I'm not a huge fan of the next door neighbors and their very loud dogs, but I choose to just not interact with them. 

I have a small container garden, mostly herbs, some tomatoes that do well in containers, and echinacea. Since native pollinators and other beneficial insects live or lay eggs in dead stuff for the winter, I don't clean up last year's garden until I'm ready to plant the current year's garden. I do what I have to to revive perennials early in the season, but last year's dead annuals stay put until I'm planting. As it's not quite time yet, all my annual seedlings are still inside. All that is to illustrate that I never have empty pots left sitting outside. The ugly dead stuff gets stacked up and pulled in towards my door, but it would have to be hurricane force winds for any of it to blow away, since we're talking about large planters full of dirt. 

It has been windy here, as is common in the springtime, and some trash has blown around. A little over a week ago, I noticed an empty pot - not mine - sitting in my neighbor's yard. Their dogs were playing with it, and I figured it was either theirs, or it had blown in and they were letting the dogs have some fun with it until trash day. I was wrong. Turns out, since I'm the one who has a garden, they assumed it was mine and were stewing about it and the fact that I didn't go over there to pick it up all week. Nobody said a word to me. 

Then, yesterday, I was leaving and saw the the empty pot had been stuck on top of one of my pots with perennial exhinacea in it, crushing some of the new leaves that were coming up. It's a hardy plant and will recover, but that was still a rude thing to do, especially when I have stacks of planters full of dead things they could have put it on. My landlords happened to be outside too, and they told me that neighbor is really upset I didn't go pick up my garbage that blew into their yard. They continued that even if it wasn't mine, it has the appearance of being mine since I'm the one with a patio full of planters. Never mind that all my planters match and this one didn't. Never mind that all my planters have enough weight to not blow away at all times and this was empty. The argument is that I should have taken responsibility for the trash planter because I also happen to engage with that hobby. 

For what it's worth, the planter was cracked and unusable.

He was making funny faces and stuff at me and acting all immature. And I was doing work so I was annoyed about it because he kept distracting me. So I went way too far and made a comment on his appearance. He seems to have kyphosis or some back condition because he has a very noticeable hump/hunchback on his back.

125,1cc1erd,AITA: for not wanting contact with my mother after her getting a new boyfriend? ,"I am a female (23) who unexpectedly lost her father (58) back in September. He got a heart attack the day of my uncle‚Äôs funeral and passed away a few hours later. My mother (51) and my father were together for over 24 years and still married. 

My father‚Äôs passing was very traumatic for me. I followed EMDR therapy for it up until 5 weeks ago. My mother was devastated after my father‚Äôs passing. She became very tired of life and kept telling me and my brother everything she wanted to do to end her life. She also made me feel like my dad passing away wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal compared to her losing her partner. Overall, she was not acting like a mother should towards her children who were going through an equally awful time. She could feel me wanting to put some space between us, but dragged me to spiritual therapists who told me lies about my father and who said my father didn‚Äôt want me and my mother to fight after his passing. These sessions really hurt me a lot, hearing weirdo‚Äôs say untruthful things about my dad who had just passed away. 

Edit: when my mother voiced she had a hard time staying alive, I slept over at her house for multiple weeks, leaving my partner and own house behind. I tried to get her to go to a real psychologist and went with her a few times. But she didn‚Äôt want to hear anything being said and voiced she only trusted psychics and spiritual workers. During the weeks I spend with her, I noticed my own mental health declining because of the whole situation. When I said I wanted to go back home, she told me nobody cared about her. When I went home, I still came over multiple times a week to be with her. She told me multiple times she wanted to harm herself because nobody was there for me and that I didn‚Äôt care.

After about 3 months my mom started spending a lot of time with a man. It hurt me a lot and I asked her if they were dating. She kept assuring me she was not dating and that she was not looking for anyone to date yet. Yet she kept being very secretive and going away a lot. All the while saying my dad was her true love and that she could never love anyone else.
I know my mom is still young and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to be lonely for the rest of her life, but I was still very much grieving my dad and trying to get over the trauma I experienced.

After 5 months of my dad passing, my mother invited me over. She made me listen to a voice recording of a psychic saying my mom and my dad are real soulmates and were meant to be together. After the recording was finished, my mom said she is dating again. I became very emotional and she said: ‚ÄòI knew you were going to do this‚Äô. I left the house and blocked her on social media. 

After 4 weeks of no contact, an uncle of mine came over and said my mom wanted to bring her boyfriend over for Easter. But she said I had to meet her boyfriend before Easter, which meant I had 3 days time to meet him before Easter took place. I declined and said I wasn‚Äôt ready yet. She decided not to bring said boyfriend to Easter after people telling her that wouldn‚Äôt be fair on me. During Easter she kept telling family members that I wasn‚Äôt accepting her new relationship while I could literally hear her say it. She also went outside a couple of times to stand next to the window where I was seated to go and cry.

Am I an asshole for not wanting to talk to her? Or should I get over myself and let her be happy?

127,1cc196e,AITA- For standing firm on my assumption of family?,"I have to add back story otherwise it won‚Äôt make sense. Hang in with me for a moment. So when I was 16 my parents got a divorce. At 17 I was kicked out of my moms house for fighting with my mom (I was driving myself and 3 younger siblings to and from our original school district 40 mins away to and from every weekday because my mom moved all of us in with a guy she met 3 months ago.) I lived out of my car to finish up high school while all my sisters had to relocate to new school districts. I tried to commit that year and thankfully failed. Since then I lived with my dad. Well my dad got a new girlfriend an hour away and I was by myself in the house he had purchased.
 I got Covid for my 21st and was abandoned by all to go through a very scary situation by myself. I crawled to get food and water and could not breathe sitting or laying down. After I got better I started to make candles for Christmas gifts and started a fire in my dad‚Äôs house. I was kicked out by my dad and moved to AZ to live on my own.
I lived in AZ till I was 25 and really missed family so I moved back. Despite me trying weekly I‚Äôve barely gotten to see anyone in the year I‚Äôve been back.

Main story- so me and siblings were fighting because I was frustrated at a lack of respect or communication when we would try to plan things. I was invited on a family vacation to Disney and I didn‚Äôt want to go. My Step Mom/SM begged me to go and I resolved to go despite my internal warnings. Well I ended up being really sick, I had a viral infection. So I asked to go to the nearest Walgreens to get meds the first time I was allowed to go as we (total of 9) had drove down in two vehicles. I got meds without the good stuff and it didn‚Äôt work so I asked to go back the next night to get something better.
I was lied to about the both car keys being with SM and that I didn‚Äôt need to go out. SM had found out that I brought thc-mints at 5 mg, one for each of us sisters to have the first night to calm tensions. SM decided I was only going out to buy weed. I had already been there for 3 days feeling really sick, running on 2-3 hours of sleep each night. So after begging and begging to get help I put an Uber, plane tickets, and mask on my credit card and went home. Once home, boyfriend picked me up put me in bed and unpacked for me as I slept for two straight days. 
The next time I went to family event I was told I was a lier and a stealer. SM was under assumption that I stole her deceased mother‚Äôs blanket. And that they were mad at me for my disrespect during the trip. I found out later SM was upset because she spent over $30000 for the trip and she thought I was looking for any way out. I‚Äôve gone no contact but both my dad and SM want to reconcile and move past this. I understand spending that much and planning for everything only for someone to be sick is hard but it shouldn‚Äôt be neglectful. So anyways AITA if I don‚Äôt to ‚Äòmove past this‚Äô? ",Everyone Sucks,2024-04-24,"AITA- For standing firm on my assumption of family? I have to add back story otherwise it won‚Äôt make sense. Hang in with me for a moment. So when I was 16 my parents got a divorce. At 17 I was kicked out of my moms house for fighting with my mom (I was driving myself and 3 younger siblings to and from our original school district 40 mins away to and from every weekday because my mom moved all of us in with a guy she met 3 months ago.) I lived out of my car to finish up high school while all my sisters had to relocate to new school districts. I tried to commit that year and thankfully failed. Since then I lived with my dad. Well my dad got a new girlfriend an hour away and I was by myself in the house he had purchased.
 I got Covid for my 21st and was abandoned by all to go through a very scary situation by myself. I crawled to get food and water and could not breathe sitting or laying down. After I got better I started to make candles for Christmas gifts and started a fire in my dad‚Äôs house. I was kicked out by my dad and moved to AZ to live on my own.
I lived in AZ till I was 25 and really missed family so I moved back. Despite me trying weekly I‚Äôve barely gotten to see anyone in the year I‚Äôve been back.

Main story- so me and siblings were fighting because I was frustrated at a lack of respect or communication when we would try to plan things. I was invited on a family vacation to Disney and I didn‚Äôt want to go. My Step Mom/SM begged me to go and I resolved to go despite my internal warnings. Well I ended up being really sick, I had a viral infection. So I asked to go to the nearest Walgreens to get meds the first time I was allowed to go as we (total of 9) had drove down in two vehicles. I got meds without the good stuff and it didn‚Äôt work so I asked to go back the next night to get something better.
I was lied to about the both car keys being with SM and that I didn‚Äôt need to go out. SM had found out that I brought thc-mints at 5 mg, one for each of us sisters to have the first night to calm tensions. SM decided I was only going out to buy weed. I had already been there for 3 days feeling really sick, running on 2-3 hours of sleep each night. So after begging and begging to get help I put an Uber, plane tickets, and mask on my credit card and went home.

As we grew older, I moved away but we stayed in contact. About 4 months ago Hon and I decided we should take a vacation together. We discussed how we wanted to get a break from the day to day needs of others. I booked a cabin at a retreat a few hours from home. The first 24 hours of our trip were seemingly normal. We get to our cabin and start catching up. The next morning I wake up, make coffee, and decide to take a hike. When I came back Hon asks to see where I had went so we walk off  together.

I also expressed that we are two different people who handle and see emotions different. She‚Äôs more sensitive than I am and I often find myself always coddling her emotions. I tried to make her realize that I understand some parts but not all of is and that‚Äôs ok bc we are humans that will never see eye to eye on every single thing. I expressed that we should also have space bc if we are constantly hanging out how can I make time for other people?

My sister lives in New York. Last year she visits on kind of a whim and drives here (to where I live in eastern Ohio) to visit and see me and my son. She stays for 3 days or so and before she leaves, so proposes the idea of leaving her vehicle here at my house so that I can use it in the interim while shes in New York. She cites that having her own vehicle in New York can be really bothersome, which I took at face value for seeing that it has that windshield paint/numerals on the top right corner of it on cars you see get impounded. Also the back driver side bumper/panel is clearly side-swiped, which she says was a snow plow.

Now, she says she'll come get the car whenever she needs it but she hasn't in the entirety of me having it (8 months), nor has she communicated that she even plans on coming to get it/use it anytime soon.

I see this as a win/win because my personal car was an old 2000 model. It was old, rusting and only a 2 door that I had to squeeze into to get my son into the backseat car seat. I felt infinitely more at ease/safer with him in a 2014 sedan.

I come to find out that car insurance isn't being paid approximately 3 months ago and forwarded that info to a mutual family member because they offered to help, which ultimately ended up fizzling out, so I need to investigate that again. She can be difficult to talk to, because she only talks when \*she\* wants to.

I take the car in to get an oil change and find out the tread is non-existent on both front wheels. I decline having them replaced that day so I can ask her to help with it.

I take the car back and get the tire replaced, because I have to.

I ask her for help via phone call(she answered) and text to help pay for HALF, because it doesn't take 8 months to wear down the tires to nothing, but she takes 19 days to respond, to which she ultimately tells me ""You are driving a FREE vehicle, ask any unbiased person the question and see what their response would be.

133,1cc0ppx,AITA for my response to our cat being outside?,"About 3 years ago my partner and I got a cat. He had been an indoor and outdoor cat in the city but the person who had him could no longer keep him and asked us to take him, and my partner said yes. My partner also agreed to be the one to take him to the vet and clean his litter box since I am allergic to cats. (I am allergic to a LOT so I take allergy meds 2x a day already.)

We live in a very rural, woodsy area with lots of predators and I did not want him to continue being an outdoor cat. I work at it to try and keep him inside. We also have a dog and when the dog was being let out, the cat would run under her legs and go out. Lately, the cat has been very good about not sneaking out, but my partner frequently leaves the door wide open while the dog is out so that she can come back in on her own. I don‚Äôt like this since the cat runs out while the door is open.

Two days ago, my partner and I had a serious conversation about them leaving the door open so the cat gets out. They seemed to understand and said they would not leave the door open like that anymore.

Last night, they left the door open again while the dog was out and I let my frustration be heard in my voice when I asked them why they couldn't seem to shut the door. They then \*promised\* they would start shutting the door.

This morning, I was getting out of the shower when I heard the cat meowing outside. I went downstairs to let him in and I was angry. I texted my partner, who was at work, and I told them that I would not forgive them if something happened to the cat and that I couldn't understand why it was so difficult to shut the door when the dog goes out and open it again when she comes to the door to be let back in. There was no name calling or anything similarly disrespectful.

My partner came back at me, angry with me for ""assuming"" and said that they let the cat out on purpose because the cat was sitting and staring at the door and that I ""ruined the day"" by being angry at them first thing in the morning. I said the only reason I assumed was because of historical precedence, as recently as \*last night\* and that they're turning things around by expecting me to apologize for being upset about the cat being outside, yet again.

My partner is now home from work and we are in separate rooms of the house, not speaking, because \*I\* should be the one to apologize.

Edited to add that my partner often says they hate the cat and hopes it doesn't come home one day. This cat is no bother to anyone. He's very quiet and not bothersome at all. Due to my partner's feelings on the cat, I feel strongly that the door being left open is intentional.

He had been an indoor and outdoor cat in the city but the person who had him could no longer keep him and asked us to take him, and my partner said yes. My partner also agreed to be the one to take him to the vet and clean his litter box since I am allergic to cats. (I am allergic to a LOT so I take allergy meds 2x a day already.)

We live in a very rural, woodsy area with lots of predators and I did not want him to continue being an outdoor cat. I work at it to try and keep him inside. We also have a dog and when the dog was being let out, the cat would run under her legs and go out. Lately, the cat has been very good about not sneaking out, but my partner frequently leaves the door wide open while the dog is out so that she can come back in on her own. I don‚Äôt like this since the cat runs out while the door is open.

Two days ago, my partner and I had a serious conversation about them leaving the door open so the cat gets out. They seemed to understand and said they would not leave the door open like that anymore.

Last night, they left the door open again while the dog was out and I let my frustration be heard in my voice when I asked them why they couldn't seem to shut the door. They then \*promised\* they would start shutting the door.

This morning, I was getting out of the shower when I heard the cat meowing outside. I went downstairs to let him in and I was angry. I texted my partner, who was at work, and I told them that I would not forgive them if something happened to the cat and that I couldn't understand why it was so difficult to shut the door when the dog goes out and open it again when she comes to the door to be let back in. There was no name calling or anything similarly disrespectful.

My partner came back at me, angry with me for ""assuming"" and said that they let the cat out on purpose because the cat was sitting and staring at the door and that I ""ruined the day"" by being angry at them first thing in the morning. I said the only reason I assumed was because of historical precedence, as recently as \*last night\* and that they're turning things around by expecting me to apologize for being upset about the cat being outside, yet again.

My partner is now home from work and we are in separate rooms of the house, not speaking, because \*I\* should be the one to apologize.

A friend and myself (F34) went to a video game arcade a few days back for a day of nerdy childish fun.

There were plenty of kids around, which of course there was. No issue there. Until we started hearing unholy screaming coming out of a zombie game. And I‚Äôm talking too of lungs, screaming. Not ‚Äúwhooooo‚Äù I‚Äôm excited screaming but the sound of someone just making the loudest noise they can. And it was a lot. Lots of people kept going over to investigate but backing off. Just staring and not saying anything.

Now this was annoying af but I tried to ignore it.

Until it kept going on. For at least 10 minutes. It was clear 1) this was on purpose and 2) no one was gonna do anything about it. Certainly no parents. You could hear this above 70 arcade machines and various people.

I finally snapped. Went right up to the game, yanked the curtain aside and there were two boys I‚Äôd say about 11-13?. I didn‚Äôt raise my voice I just went ‚ÄúYou two. Stop that. Right. Now. Are we clear?‚Äù They nodded and I left. No further screams the rest of the day.

I mentioned this to a friend in a convo about people not knowing how to act in public these days as an example and they said I was an asshole for doing that. That I wasn‚Äôt their parent and have no right to tell off a strangers kids.

Lily used to have her every 4 weeks Friday and Saturday during school term and we split the holidays 90-10. I live a few hours away from her so this was the more stable system for Katie. Lilly claims I moved extremely far away the second I had the majority custody to reduce the amount of time she has with Katie, but she is very much deletional.  
Katie attends a private boarding school this year, so a new custody agreement was written. We still have a 90-10 split for holidays with them being longer for private schools. In addition, Katie chooses who to spend the in-between term break with whom she wants. She has spent those with me, infuriating Lilly as she hoped Katie would choose her for those.

  
Long story short, the real issue happened last week. Katie had gotten her period for the first time and was sent to the Nurse's office. She asked one of the teachers to call her mom but had meant her step-mom, Misa. So when the teacher handed her the phone expecting to hear Misa's voice it was awkward. The issue was quickly fixed with the teacher eventually calling Misa, but not without Lilly getting mad.

  
The teacher had informed Lily that her daughter had gotten her period and wanted her step-mom for comfort. Plus, she had accidentally called her instead of misa. Lilly had heard Katie say mom through the phone and put two and two together. Figuring she thought she was talking to Misa when she had cried mom.  
An hour later, Lilly phoned me screaming and in tears. She called me a selfish pig for allowing Katie to call another woman mom. Furthermore, she insulted my wife and threatened to tear her apart if she didn‚Äôt stay away from her daughter. Before hanging up the phone, she threatened to teach Katie a lesson.

  
Lily has always hated me since I never paid child support ( maintenance ) and never allowed her to take Katie to see her family in the USA. She lives in a shit apartment and has always been jealous of her daughter. She‚Äôs mentally unstable and blames it on me for not providing for her.

Just to make it clear, I have been married to misa for six years. I started dating her when Katie had been born and she has treated katie as her own since day 1.

This is a fairly low stakes AITA but I'm not sure whether or not I should press it. My older sister is getting married at the end of the summer. We are all adults - I'm in my thirties and she's in her forties - and we generally have a pretty good relationship. My sister, to give a bit of context is a more frugal person than I am, and because I knew that about her, and because I'm an arts and crafty type of person, I offered to help her with her wedding planning and decorating. 

She decided that her theme is flowers, and asked me to take on making a whole bunch of paper flowers that can be used to decorate the wedding location. Honestly, it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to it. Here's where the conflict comes in. Because I didn't know how to make these specific types of paper flowers, I reached out to a friend of mine who makes them and asked her run a workshop for my sister and I and another friend. She agreed and told us the cost was $100 per person.

Now, I never clarified with my sister that she would be paying the whole fee for this, but because I'm volunteering a whole lot of time over the course of the summer to make her literally hundreds of paper flowers so she can have this beautiful exciting wedding event, I had assumed that she would pay for the workshop. However, this morning I got a message from my friend saying that I could e-transfer her the $100 I owe her for the workshop last weekend. I paid, but I'm very seriously considering reaching out to my sister and asking her why I have to pay for this when I'm going to be putting in a lot of unpaid labor over the summer for her wedding. 

Right now $100 can be a lot for me, but isn't as much for her, and so I'm trying to balance wanting to not rock the boat but also feeling a little bit hurt that this is cost that I have to factor in unexpectedly, and also just understanding that I never clarified whether or not we were paying for participation in the workshop.

141,1cbzrq8,AITA for planning a trip with a close friend who is dating my best friend?,"3 years ago, I met my now close friend Paul when he was vacationing in my country. We met because we matched on an app, I had plans to move to his country eventually, so we bonded over that. After two dates, it was clear to me I wasn't feeling any chemistry or attraction, so I asked him if we could stay friends instead. Paul agreed and we've been good friends since.

Fast forward 2.5 years later, I finally moved to Paul's country, and while I was excited I achieved my dream, in the beginning I struggled a lot. At that time, the only person I could hang out with socially was Paul. To be clear, I've made effort to make new friends and now luckily I do, but first few months were very lonely.

A month later after I moved to Paul's country, my best friend was suffering from a breakup and I offered her to fly out to visit me. One night I took her out for drinks and invited my friend to join us as well. They hit it off and started to date. I was genuinely happy, two people I cared a lot about got together. During her stay, all three of us went to a concert together and at some point Paul and I brought up a trip we had been planning to do for a long time now. Paul's hometown is famous for its Christmas market. We had planned to do a 2 day trip early December and we were trying to find the right dates. While this discussion was happening, my best friend Kate was there as well. All she said was 'that sounds so much fun, wish I lived here as well so I could come with you guys'. She never showed she was angry about the trip.

Fast forward a few weeks later, Kate was back home and they were dating long distance(for a month at this point). Paul and I went out for drinks to catch up and look at the train tickets. When I came back home, I got angry messages from Kate, calling me selfish, immature and that I had no sense of boundaries. That I was an asshole for going on a trip with her boyfriend. I tried to explain Paul wasn't just her boyfriend, he was my friend and we've done a trip together once in the past already, and that of course she'd be part of this trip if she lived in the same country as us. She kept being furious at me, saying I was a drama queen for complaining about not having friends in the new country, that I should keep my distance from Paul now that they're dating. She admitted she didn't even want me hanging out with Paul at all and it wasn't just about the trip. She felt any free time Paul spent with his friends took away from time he and Kate had to facetime. I told her she had zero trust in me and Paul, but she kept insisting it wasn't a trust issue. That it wasn't 'right' to do a trip together.

I canceled the trip and barely saw Paul anymore. Kate was still angry for a MONTH and refused to let me stay at her place when I visited my homecountry (for context, I had rented out my apartment when I moved to the new country and we had agreed I'd stay at her spare room whenever I visited).

143,1cbzio2,AITA for leaving a party at my own house to go to sleep?,"TLDR: Been stressed and tired lately, so I left a party at my own house to go to sleep.

I (39y M) live with my wife (39y F), son (4y M), and MIL (66y F).  My business is running into problems lately, so I have been stressed and unable to sleep much.  In the last 5 days, I have probably slept maybe 20 hours.  I have been occasionally breaking out into hives lately as well which may or may not be stress related.

My wife wanted to throw a party, invite maybe 30-ish people of our mutual friends, her own friends and co-workers, and their kids.  She let me know the day before.  I was a bit annoyed with the short notice, but I have long accepted that my wife is very sociable and outgoing, so I don't argue about those sort of things.  I am more of an introvert, but I usually try my best to keep up with her.  Plus she said that if I needed to work late that night, it's okay, don't worry about anything, and she would have a plate of food ready for me when I got home.

So I got home at around 8:00 PM, and everyone was basically there.  I ate a bit, and made the rounds to visit people.  My social battery went to zero pretty quickly, and I had popped a Benadryl (instead of my usual Claritin), so I was actually getting tired.  Our house is not that big, so there were people just about everywhere.  No real place of refuge, and regardless, it would have been too loud to truly fall asleep.

I told my wife that I am tired and that I am going to sleep in my car.  I thought better of it once I got in my car, figuring that everyone would think I am weird whenever they ended up seeing me.  So I decided to drive to my other house, where my parents live, to go crash on their couch (they were at home and not in attendance at the party).  Also figured that no one would truly notice.  People outside would think I'm inside, people inside would think I'm outside, etc.  This was around 9:15 PM.

Woke up the next morning to a few missed calls from my wife, and one of our friends.  They had called between midnight and 1 AM.  Came home at like 6 AM before anyone woke up, made breakfast for everyone, got ready for work, and got my son ready for school.  My wife said that I am an AH for leaving, which embarrassed her in front of her friends, and not helping clean up afterwards.

144,1cbzei5,AITA for not going to my family's camping trip,"First, I would like to apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes I might make.

I(16F) am in high-school, and all of my finals are in May and early June. Also, right now in my country it's school vacation time. Now, my family has a tradition of going camping in the same spot around this time(as well as in the summer and the fall). However, I've warned my dad(45M) and my step mom(40F) that it's unlikely that I would join the trip thus year, since I need time to study.

Both of them got upset about this and said that I know about the trip a long time now, and I should manage my time better. So we worked out a solution - I join them for a few days and leave early to go to my moms house.

It's important to note that we don't own a car, so we relay on public transportation, and also that my parents aren't the best with time management. They said we would leave in Monday morning, and I'll go home Thursday morning, but we missed the bus, so they said we'll leave Tuesday night. Then, they missed the last bus too.

My dad wanted to stay at the station and leave on the first morning bus, but at this point, I saw no point in making all that effort of carrying all our camping stuff in the heat just for me to leave less than a day later, so I told him that.

He got mad, and started saying that I don't value our time as a family, that I didn't want to go in the first place, ect ect. I also got mad, started crying, and told him that he has no respect for my time and that I did want to go but not anymore when he's like this, then I just took my things and left, leaving them there. My sister later told me that they did took the bus.

I went to my boyfriends house.

Completely hands off. Which is not usually a good way of parenting. It instilled no good habits and never taught her how to be tidy or organized. 

Now I loved my mother in law (we lost her 2 years ago) she was more of a mother to me than my own. She had known me since I was 16. But ever since we were kids, her room has always been a disaster. It's gotten much better over time but as we became older and gathered more responsibilities I realized that it became better because I had time to keep it that way. 

When we lost my mother in law, we inherited her house, no mortgage and very low taxes (super lucky) now that allowed us to get jobs doing what we like. She works at a daycare school thing (not exactly a daycare and not exactly a school. They teach the kids there but they are 2 and 3 years old). I work in a mom and pop pet shop. It's great. As we work throughout the week, the I notice the house gets progressively messier and messier, now I work 10 hour days and drive her to work in the mornings, so I'm out of the house by 7:30 and don't get back until 8.  She works 8 hour days and is home by 5. 

I asked her to keep things tidy, not scrub the toilet, not polish the silver or some crazy shit, just do a load of laundry and maybe tidy the living room. She can't seem to do any of it. At the end of the week I end up doing 4-5 loads of laundry and throwing away a moderate amount of garbage left in the living room every day. Now my job isn't stressful or hard, mostly boring, which makes me quite tired. 

I'm just asking her for help. Not asking her to do everything. Like for instance I this past weekend I took the day to deep clean the bathroom, the kitchen, finish installing the lights in the kitchen, finish sheetrocking the living room ceiling, paint the living room walls, mulch the front garden, and mow the grass. That's my weekend. 

I just ask her to do those things when she gets home and then she can relax on her weekends. Instead she gets home from work and does nothing and then on the weekends she does nothing. Leaving it all to me. 

I finally got fed up and told her she was being lazy and unhelpful. She didn't like that at all. She told me she understood my frustration and how she doesn't help me but doesn't know why she can't gather the initiative to help out.

147,1cbyx49,AITA for telling one of my landlords sons I'm holding his dad accountable?,"So, this is a lot to unload. I will try to condense it with all the main details.

We have lived in our rental home out in the country for 12 years now. Our house sits on a county road that has 2 houses and farm fields on it. Our landlord owns all the homes and land, minus the 1 field at the beginning of the road. So pretty much all his fields, homes and a shop where the road dead ends at the canal.

Our landlords oldest son, who's is approaching his mid 40's moved into the house down the road from us about 3 years ago, during his divorce. He has always had drug and alcohol problem, but wasn't a horrible person. He was arrested out of state for drugs in a hotel with a woman l after some sort of fight. His wife chose to file for divorce. 

When he moved in he was just, there. Things progressed and he began bringing some shady people around and getting into harder drugs it seemed. Many fights, screaming and just plain nonsense going on. We had to call the sheriff a few times, one time in the middle of the night, due to a woman screaming help.

The son finally moved out of state. That didn't last more than a month and moved back to town. We have had many issues and confrontations with him and plead for our landlord not to allow him to move back out to our area. Due to the damage at that house he caused, his dad has not allowed him back in there, so far.

I believe of I'm paying to rent this property and one of his kids is causing problems, he has a duty to at the least warn him to stay away from the area as he has no business out here.

So, this is a lot to unload. I will try to condense it with all the main details.

We have lived in our rental home out in the country for 12 years now. Our house sits on a county road that has 2 houses and farm fields on it. Our landlord owns all the homes and land, minus the 1 field at the beginning of the road. So pretty much all his fields, homes and a shop where the road dead ends at the canal.

Our landlords oldest son, who's is approaching his mid 40's moved into the house down the road from us about 3 years ago, during his divorce. He has always had drug and alcohol problem, but wasn't a horrible person. He was arrested out of state for drugs in a hotel with a woman l after some sort of fight. His wife chose to file for divorce. 

When he moved in he was just, there. Things progressed and he began bringing some shady people around and getting into harder drugs it seemed. Many fights, screaming and just plain nonsense going on. We had to call the sheriff a few times, one time in the middle of the night, due to a woman screaming help.

The son finally moved out of state. That didn't last more than a month and moved back to town. We have had many issues and confrontations with him and plead for our landlord not to allow him to move back out to our area. Due to the damage at that house he caused, his dad has not allowed him back in there, so far.

148,1cbypb3,WIBTA if i told a couple on holiday to parent their child?,"I'm (31m) on holiday with my fianc√© (36f) and our daughter (2f) at a family friendly hotel, think kids pool and playground with lots of other families, and there is another couple with their daughter (5f) let's call her jess for the post.

Jess (obviously not her fault) is looking for attention that she's not getting from her parents. Both my fiance and I have politely told her that we are there to play with our daughter and make sure she's safe in the pool as she's only just learning to swim. We've had to do this because the Jess is incessantly talking to us to the point that we literally couldn't get a word in edgewise to encourage our own child. 

At least 3 other families with children have decided to get out of the pool because Jess is in their personal space and simply won't leave them alone as well as a few older couples obviously there just trying to relax. 

In the 3 days we have been here so far, we have not seen her parents spend any time in the pool with her and they seem obvious to the fact that she is getting in other people's way. I HAVE seen the dad in the pool in the deep end whilst Jess was harassing other people in the shallow end. 

Also we have heard her ask multiple times for the parents to join her in the pool only to be flatly refused even though the dad would happily swim on his own.

My appointment was also delayed by 4 hours so by the time it was done and by the time I got home it was over 32-34 hours since I had eaten anything.

Because of this I was very hungry and tired so I decided to order some food. I asked my gf if she wanted anything but she said no. My gf said she'd rather cook than order out but I said I'd prefer a takeaway so we can just have separate meals.

She said she'd rather we both just cooked but I again refused and told her I'm ordering myself food. I ordered the food and she decided to not cook and just said she didn't want anything.

Once my food came I was sat eating and she came over and asked if she could have some. I asked if she was serious. I pointed out I asked her multiple times if she wanted anything and she's waited for me to sit and enjoy my food to try and take it.

I mentioned that I've ordered exactly what I was because of how hungry I am but she just said she was hungry too since she hadn't eaten. I mentioned that the only reason she hadn't eaten was because I didn't want to cook for her and that doesn't mean she can come and take my food instead.

I said if she wants something to eat she can either order herself something or cook it but I'm not sharing what I ordered.

I tell her that she could just eat something by herself. I tell her that she could go get something by herself. I offer to make her a snack. I offer to order in. I offer to go out with her so she doesn't want to sit somewhere by herself. None of those is a good enough response.

Then she will go back to checking if I'm sure I don't want anything. By this point I'm done and I tell her very clearly that I'm not interested and that it is the last time I am going to answer politely.

And this is when she says that I do not need to be so aggressive about answering a simple question.

I swear it takes all my self restraint not to lose it on her.

But she still complains about me being so aggressive. It is becoming a real problem.

I don't think that warning her that I'm done being polite is aggressive. I think it's me being frustrated that she won't just accept no as easy as she will yes.

154,1cbxvix,AITA; I got quite angry at a man who approached me outside of my bank trying to convert people to his religion and get a donation.,"I'm only asking this here due to my Mother literally calling me an asshole; for not taking the man's pamphlet and walking on when we got further down the street. Claiming I ""embarrassed myself and her publicly""

What happened, in a nutshell, was quite a brief exchange that I really didn't think much about, but apparently Mother thinks I took it ""too far.""

So I walked past and crossed the road to avoid the person standing with his God signs and pamphlets that many others were avoiding. Just to be accosted on the other side of the street by his partner who blocked my path. (He clearly seen me cross the street to avoid his partner). 

He handed me the pamphlet, with the usual iconography of fear mongering claiming my soul needed saving, requesting a donation of 2 pounds for his 'mission' ...

I immediately and impulsivly shook my head, sighed and stepped to walk past the man, walked to a nearby bin and put the pamphlet in the bin. 

Then as I tried to walk on he followed me, ringing a bell that he whipped out from who knows where and shouted; 'Why do you hate God when he loves you.' I tried to ignore him but he was speeding up and getting closer and kept shouting the same thing. 'Why do you hate God?' 'God loves you!' etc...

So I, still walking away, turned my head and said; 'I have no hate for something that I believe to be made up. Now stop stalking me with your little bell and find someone else to bother please, I'm busy.'

Then he didn't take the hint and still followed, so I raised my voice for the first and only time and said, ""Can you PLEASE stop STALKING ME. Fuck off!"" ... This made him stop moving, but he continued preaching in my direction as I quickly got away.

Apparently the ending exchange (saying I have no hate for something I believe to be made up then accusing him of being a stalker and swearing at him when he continued following me well down the street) is what I did that made me the asshole.

Why can religious people do and say whatever they want..? But I can't? When I didn't harm anyone, I simply binned what I considered to be rubbish. 

Tbh I'm actually not too happy with my Mum, I spoke with her and now she claims she gets where I'm coming from. But I kinda feel like she was a bit tone-deaf...

A little background; I'm gay and was very badly bullied and picked on by hyper religious kids and teachers at my all catholic school... I was also raised extremely religious and it took a lot of work to distance myself from the massive amount of trauma being religious and knowing I was 'Evil and going to hell' etc all that shit... or at least that's what I was taught, especially in school.

So I'm basically the worst person to start preaching to as I have massive trauma related to religion and how it's directly affected me and my self esteem/self worth.

155,1cbxp85,WIBTA If I don't buy my father anymore gifts?,"Long time lurker, I'm a big fan of this sub. Also, english is not my first language, so excuse any mistakes.  
  
Anyway, I (27F) have always gone all way when gifting my beloved ones in special dates. It means Christmas, bdays, Valentines, Mother's and Father's day, all that. I set a budget, look for things they might like months before the date, and alwyas buy something pretty cool. As such, I also like to receive gifts in said special ocasions.  
  
My father (66M) never remembers the dates. When I was younger, he would give me the money to buy my mother's bday, chirstmas and even aniversery presents. When I grew up and got my own cash, this stopped and he usually bought a cake or dinner for special ocasions.  
  
Thing is last year my mom almost died. She had a severe infecction, stayed 21 days in ICU and 20+ more on the hospital. She arrived home just in time for Christmas. I know it affected everyone in our family, but I still tried to manage Christimas so we could have some sort of ""normality"" in our family.

Anyway, I (27F) have always gone all way when gifting my beloved ones in special dates. It means Christmas, bdays, Valentines, Mother's and Father's day, all that. I set a budget, look for things they might like months before the date, and alwyas buy something pretty cool. As such, I also like to receive gifts in said special ocasions.  
  
My father (66M) never remembers the dates. When I was younger, he would give me the money to buy my mother's bday, chirstmas and even aniversery presents. When I grew up and got my own cash, this stopped and he usually bought a cake or dinner for special ocasions.  
  
Thing is last year my mom almost died. She had a severe infecction, stayed 21 days in ICU and 20+ more on the hospital. She arrived home just in time for Christmas. I know it affected everyone in our family, but I still tried to manage Christimas so we could have some sort of ""normality"" in our family.

156,1cbxbb4,AITA For denying to pay extra rent,"I (27M) live in a three bedroom apartment and, when my two old roommates left, found two roommates to live with me. Our lease started in August. In November, we decided to adopt a stray cat who had been living outside of our apartment. It was decided that I'd be the primary caretaker of the cat and, after getting him inside, I asked my roommates if we could isolate him in the living room by closing the doors to it and not using the outside exit to it, in case he would try to escape. They agreed. 

Fast forward to this month (April), and I caught wind from a friend that one of my roommates had been complaining that I was monopolizing the living room.  This is understandable, since I had been sleeping on the couch in there many nights to be with the cat. However, at no point since November, when I requested that the first be kept shut, did this particular roommate initiate any conversation about the rooms use/accessibility. Yesterday, I got a bill from him for a large sum of money for ""living room rent"" (1/4 of the rent) and for a larger sum of the utility bill. I agreed with him that I probably should spend more on heat for the months I slept on the couch, since there is a heating element in there that I could take advantage of, and I offered to pay more on heating for the past few months. However, I declined to pay living room rent, because at no point did be verbally or in written fashion agree to such a thing and it seems very unprofessional for him to drop a bill of ~$1000 on me after months of me not knowing we had that arrangement. The lack of communication in the beginning is what is annoying here. At no point did I say or did we agree that they were not allowed to use the living room, just that we keep it separate from the rest of the house. AITA?

A few months ago my SO was away on an overseas holiday trip with her friend and I had to stay behind due to the limitations. And now again in a few months he will be going again on the same trip while I make sacrifices.  

He discussed this with me and asked if it is okay with me, and I said realistically I can't say no because that would make me and AH. I also said that  I am disappointed and it isn't great to be in this position making all these sacrifices and being left behind. The consensus was that it is okay for him to go but I am feeling an imbalance in pressures to make this work.

159,1cbvw7x,AITA for not partying with my friend?,"Hi,

My friend is 23M I am 23 F. We are very close friends although since he moved back to his home country after college (which isn't far away) we've often only met during the holidays or whenever he comes back for a weekend.

I am doing a Master's now and I have two weeks until my exams. Also it is in Swedish and this isn't my native language so it takes more for me to process. I really need to revise as well as finish my coursework because some of the modules I find particularly difficult.

I am also someone who when it comes to drinking and partying, the hangover will make me too lazy to study for the next 2 days which in this time is crucial time wasted. He told me he was coming to visit this weekend (not solely to visit me) and i was excited and said we will do something for sure but not clubbing because I have exams next week and these types of luxuries should be a reward for myself AFTER exams.

He said that my behaviour was ""shocking"" and accused me of always being a flake. I then got angry and confronted him and asked ""why does it always have to be f\*\*\*ing clubbing and drinking when we meet"" and said how he should respect I need to focus and can't afford hangovers when exams are so soon.

He told me that he just won't ask me anymore and that I'm boring, and accused me of always avoiding seeing him but he just doesn't understand im not a party person unless im on vacation.

After telling us a story about her family situation (now know it was mostly a lie) we told her she's welcome any time. The odd sleepover became weekends over and eventually she just never left. This girl would totally destroy every room she went into - trailing dirt through the carpets, leaving dirty clothes and dishes for us to clean up, and gluttoning on our food. She would often pull me aside and give me ""advice"" as she sees herself as a good christian girl. Eventually her and my sister left for university. They had a big falling out and stopped being friends. She showed up on our doorstep once again with a new sob story and my dad allowed her to stay. She would sleep in my sisters room, use her seat at the table, and even use her beauty products. I told my dad I didn't like it and he said he wasn't sure how to handle it but couldn't kick her out. My sister was furious and had a massive row with my father over it - they've barely spoken since. People often see the three of us out in public and assume she is my older sister. Did I mention she brought a puppy and took it home where she expected us to take care of it? Yeah well she said she would put it down if we didn't keep it so my dad caved yet again. She doesn't pay for any of the food, hasn't trained it, and would watch and laugh when my dad would clean its shit and piss out of the carpet because she'd never remember to let it outside. She's also just got really weird habits, like getting changed in the garage (which means she has to walk through my room, weird house layout), showering with the door open, using this apple cider vinegar all over her skin (because of exma?) but then just leaving puddles of it in the bathroom which stink up the house, leaving used sanitary products around, her toothbrush in the kitchen... A few years ago we realised we'd lost all the towels and found them in a stinking heap in the corner of my sisters wardrobe. Yet she's always wearing expensive new clothes and drives a fancy car. She's like 22 now and literally has a flat that she chooses not to live in (our home is in a better area near the beach). Now I want her gone. I think the way she has treated my family home, my sister and taking advantage of my dad's generosity is repulsive.

I wouldn't call us friends, but we worked together a lot because of a big assignment, and I often spend lunch time with her and the same group of students. Kind of like good colleagues.

Ellen's parents own their own supermarket and are quite well off (think: yacht, 2 vacation homes, 4 cars). I know this because Ellen has a habit of bringing up her financial status on a regular basis. At the beginning of the year it didn't annoy me because it was just casually mentioned now and then and she wasn't hurting anyone with it. But as time went on this changed to her actively trying to turn the conversation towards the topic, often during times where it would be considered ""tone-deaf"".

For example another classmate ""Elisa"" got into a car accident and had to stay in the hospital. As she was sharing her experience during lunch, Ellen said: ""oh I got into a really bad accident too once, on my yacht. I lost my balance and fell backwards. My neck was sore for days"".

The situation where I called her out was this one: Ellen's best friend ""Lydia"" had her backpack and laptop stolen and was crying uncontrollable. Ellen gave her a hug and said: ""you don't need to cry, you can just buy a new one!"". Lydia said that she couldn't, to which Ellen replied: ""oh c'mon it's not that expensive. With the software we need a laptop of ‚Ç¨1200/$1280 should be enough"". I replied: ""Ellen not everyone is as financially comfortable as you"".

Ellen clearly didn't like that. She raised her voice and told me that people only see the money but they don't see how much effort she has to put in to get in. That she works at her parents' supermarket every Sunday and that she deserves every coin she owns.  I told her that I didn't mean that she doesn't deserve it, and that it's a good thing that she doesn't have to worry about money, but that she should consider that most of our fellow students have a different situation.

It didn't get mentioned anymore, but the overall mood has been quite cold since then and I'm wondering if maybe I went too far. Both my boyfriend and best friend (both 30's) said that I should have ignored it because ""19 is basically still a kid"" and ""it's not my job to teach her empathy"".

So, AITA?

Edit: I noticed that people focus on the age difference a lot, so let me clarify: the group I have lunch with consists of students aged 19-36.

 He's putting up the tv bracket to go on the wall and I'm helping here and there but no too much as he doesn't like being interrupted or in his language, doesn't like me asking any kind of obvious/non obvious questions!

Cut story short, towards the end he's screwing the bracket into the socket. Tbf the screws are quite thick and we don't have anything appropriate to tighten it. He managed to do it with a wrench I believe but not still can't get it tight

.In between all this, I'm asking him questions here and there. To him they are stupid questions and I'm asking obvious question to him purposely! So he answered, rudely in my book, saying that he's not f* stupid, he knows what he's doing. I told him that I really don't like your tone. (Just to mention that I'm only trying to help him and asking him the maybe obvious   question thinking why do we have so many parts left?)

Anyways, i went to my study and left him sort it out. He goes through the cupboard to check some other tools. Silly me, dared to ask him again that why there are so many different washers and some of them aren't even used?

Guess what, he reacts as above again!

This time I just walked off to bedroom, left him to it without saying anything. He then ends of cleaning himself the mess the drilling made.He then came upstairs good an hour later, had shower, etc, and watched what I was watching on Tv. 

I showed him the socket wrench from amazon and ordered it to be delivered next day. I then asked him, just before he was goingbed that I really don't appreciate the tone he used. He could have answered me simply without blowing his top off.

He said i was asking obvious questions and bothering him, don't trust him. He didn't need my help then, but only for putting the TV and marking the wall for screws.

Afterwards, he says I didn't even come down to help him clean the mess!
I said you didn't need my help so why didn't need me help cleaning. So we ended up arguing with each other and he blamed me that I don't let him sleep when he's travelling for work in the morning. At that point, I just left the bedroom, thinking he totally gaslighted the situation!

168,1cbtmmi,AITA for saying I don't see why my sister always has to be included but I don't?,"Me (15f) and my sister (16f) are only 11 months apart but we're really different. She was always the prettier one, the more outgoing and popular one. She was always surrounded by friends and loves all things makeup and fashion. I'm more introverted and shy and I never really fit the way she did. Though I always wanted to have friends. I like video games and baking and reading. I'm not into beauty stuff like she is. I don't really ever wear makeup. So we've never had much in common.

I have tried to be close to my sister but it never worked out. We're just too different. And she resented my attempts for us to be closer. She'd let her friends say mean things about me like calling me a freak, a weirdo, saying I was lame and dumb. Sometimes they'd be in our house and they'd kick me out of the basement, which is set up for games and movies and stuff like that. They'd tell me I couldn't hang out with them and they wanted to watch something. My parents would always tell me to find something else to do. And a few times her friends split up at our house and some were outside and some in the basement so I really only had my room as a refuge. I told my parents about what the others would say about me and they really didn't care. I think once they said they'd deal with it but it didn't stop. My parents just let them kick me out of spaces or tell me to stop doing what I was doing so they could do it and it was never a problem.

When I started high school I finally found a group of friends I fit in with. There's five of us and we're all really close. I even have a boyfriend now. But my sister hates that she's not welcome in with them and the reason for that is before I was friends with them she and her friends were really awful to them and she would mock them or make fun of them for their appearance or for being weird. So none of them like her. My boyfriend is the only one without that history because he moved to town right at the start of high school so never knew my sister before we got close. When my friends are over my sister will try to insert herself and she's tried to do that by making fun of me or pushing me out but my friends actually like me.

The problem is my parents are not okay with my sister being excluded and they said if I want to hang out with my friends, we have to be open to her hanging out if she wants. She has more free time now because her friendship group had this big fight and now there's so many splits and smaller groups and nobody has the time so she's around more and wants to be involved.

170,1cbt232,AITA for calling my roommate a creep,"I (F19) have been sharing a room with my roommate (F21) since the last six months. When we first met each other we shared little things about ourselves and she briefly mentioned about her crush(M22). Let's call him Max.

As we settled into our new life(we're in med school), she recounted everything that transpired between her and her crush. Just a little info: she met her crush in cram school and he is one year senior to her.

She confessed to him in 2019 and he rejected her and it has been like 4 years since she last saw him and she is still not over him. And I don't have a problem with that. Not everyone gets over their first love so easily. Now here's the thing: she confessed to him on November 24, 2019. And she cried on November 24 and she told me she cries on Nov 24 every year. She knows where he lives and hangs around whenever she gets the chance because she wants to see him (she hasn't yet). She has collected the soil of the locality he lives in and treasures it. She whined everyday about why he doesn't follow her back on insta and why he doesn't reply to her single 'hi'.

Very recently, while stalking him she conjectured that he had a gf. Since then she has been unbearable . She has stalked the poor girl's account, has sent that girl a follow request on insta, is trying to know everything about her. My roommate first asked her friend about her, then her crush's younger brother about the girl and now the crush's closest friend(let's call the friend B for feasibility) She started the convo with B by asking for recommendations for good headphones (a pretence).

When we first met each other we shared little things about ourselves and she briefly mentioned about her crush(M22). Let's call him Max.

As we settled into our new life(we're in med school), she recounted everything that transpired between her and her crush. Just a little info: she met her crush in cram school and he is one year senior to her.

She confessed to him in 2019 and he rejected her and it has been like 4 years since she last saw him and she is still not over him. And I don't have a problem with that. Not everyone gets over their first love so easily. Now here's the thing: she confessed to him on November 24, 2019. And she cried on November 24 and she told me she cries on Nov 24 every year. She knows where he lives and hangs around whenever she gets the chance because she wants to see him (she hasn't yet). She has collected the soil of the locality he lives in and treasures it. She whined everyday about why he doesn't follow her back on insta and why he doesn't reply to her single 'hi'.

Very recently, while stalking him she conjectured that he had a gf. Since then she has been unbearable . She has stalked the poor girl's account, has sent that girl a follow request on insta, is trying to know everything about her. My roommate first asked her friend about her, then her crush's younger brother about the girl and now the crush's closest friend(let's call the friend B for feasibility) She started the convo with B by asking for recommendations for good headphones (a pretence).

173,1cbs8su,AITAH for bailing on dinner,"I (32 M) bailed on a dinner that my oldest friend (32M ) had talked about for a few weeks. 

Context: my buddy lives out of the city for the last year coming back once in a while. He and i talked a lot about going to Kbbq on one of two days wednesday or tuesday, when he and i were free. Leading up to the tuesday/ Wednesday it was seemingly set in stone we were going to do kbbq with one other mutual who i also spoke to/ see weekly for rock climbing. The three of us were down. On the sunday, they both start to suggest other food, monday, they say, maybe korean fried chicken, but i was pretty adamant i wanted kbbq since it had been a month since i had been there, and more than 6 months since i had been with ny boy. On tuesday i mentioned it again around 5 pm asking if we could just do, but one of them didnt respond, and the one that did saying ‚Äúthe timing just doesnt work out‚Äù 

No big deal. 

So my friend and i went to my usual kbbq spot. I reach out to my best friend who is staying close by woth his parents and let him know i was at our spot with my friend and he should come. As i send it he says he is getting kbbq too. And another mutual smacks me on the back, asking me if im on a date. I was a little shocked to look over and see our friend group at a table (6 people) with my two buddies there eating. So i went over and was like ‚Äúis this why you guys didnt wanna do kbbq?!?‚Äù They were like ‚Äúnoo its not that deep‚Äù and i went back to my table.

The rest of the evening i just felt awkward as hell. Didnt know how to address feeling left out. And at 1 am my best bud messaged me to see how i was feeling. Saying ‚Äúyea i figured you would feel some type of way‚Äù 

After that convo, which i decided to drop. I told him i would be down to grab food tomorrow (Wednesday), agreed on skewers. Which was all good.

Later in the day he mentioned that all the people he was at dinner the night before and him were going to go rock climbing before dinner. I had sprained my ankle at the start of the year and have had been openly staying away from it to avoid injury before jobs. So i declined climbing. Around 7pm get a google maps location text from my boi saying be here for 9 pm, a location about 25 minutes from me. I told him i have to work at 6 am next day, so i was hoping we would be eating around 6/7 and that i couldn‚Äôt make it.  I was also a little salty about the night before and hate that after all this delegation location changed again. Still feeling some type of way.

I feel like i was being an asshole for cancelling dinner. But as i type this i guess it still happened just not with me.
I feel like the AH because my buddy just shortened his trip to go back home a week early because his girl needs help with their new puppy back home. So i actually wont get to see him for another few months. I feel guilty i didnt make the time for him while he was here. I feel petty as heck.

So, AITAH for bailing on dinner or am i just being a sensitive b-hole?

174,1cbrxng,"AITA for wishing my friend ""Happy Lesbian Visibility Week"" at a gathering?","Last week, my friend, J (21F), from high school came to a reunion after like 2 years because she lives overseas now. I live in an Asian country where people can be somewhat homophobic. She's a lesbian. She's never ""come out"", but if you've ever talked to her you can tell she's gay (talks about past relationships and attraction to women) and she's just never made a big deal out of it, the most she did to ""come out"" was add a pride flag to her instagram bio in June. So our friend circle is all in the know - also, some people have asked her if she's gay before and she has always responded affirmatively. She told me she was only attracted to women, when I asked. 

  
We met up at a restaurant for dinner, there were like 30 of us, and when we met, I wished J a ""Happy Lesbian Visibility Week"" as I've recently come to know that's a thing. Pretty much everyone at the event knew she was gay, except maybe 3 guys who we don't talk with much, so others also chimed in with wishing her. One guy, H, spoke up and said he didn't know Lesbian Visibility Week was a thing and asked J why she couldn't be happy with the entirety of June being ""for the gays"" and said ""congrats for being a homo"". It kind of soured the conversation and J looked clearly uncomfortable so I told H to shut it and that no one asked for his opinion. For the next 10 minutes, H kept talking over J and asking her questions like ""what's wrong with liking men"" and ""do your parents know about this?"". I told him to stop multiple times but he only did once I threatened to kick him out of the restaurant. The vibe was gone and we wrapped up the event early. 

  
After it was over, J approached me and thanked me but said she'd have appreciated it if I hadn't brought up her sexuality in the first place and that the reason she didn't ""come out"" was because of reactions like this and that she didn't want to have to deal with that. I was confused and told her that well she did come out I mean she wasn't hiding it so I didn't know it was supposed to be secret. She got irritated and told me to just keep it to myself next time and I said I didn't appreciate her disregarding my good intentions and maybe there wouldn't be a next time we meet at this rate. I don't think I did anything wrong, if anyone was in the wrong it was obviously H.

175,1cbrqej,AITA for swiping right on my friend's hookup?,"  My friend, Sam, and I met through meet me years ago, dated briefly, but it didn't work out. She was bisexual and I was experimenting with lesbian relationships. Sam was also way out of my league. I ended up realizing that I was straight, and we agreed to stay friends because we got along really well.

  Flash forward a few years, and we're both in our ""hoe"" phase. We would show each other the guys that we were hooking up with and talk about how things went. She showed me this extremely handsome guy and told me that he was incredible in the sack. I asked Sam if she'd keep seeing him, but she said no because he was too arrogant. We moved on and didn't talk about him after that. About a week later, I'm swiping on Tinder, see him, and swipe right. I honestly just swiped right because of my own insecurities and wanted to be validated by an attractive man. We matched right away. I was really swept up in him finding me attractive, but I wasn't sure how Sam would feel about it. 

  Sam and I had planned to hang out the next day, so I just waited to talk to her about it until then. She had texted me that night worried about groceries, so me and my grandma got together a truckload full of groceries for me to give to her the next day as well. I didn't have a car, so she came and picked me up and I loaded the groceries in her car. On the way to Sam's place, I told her what happened the night before and asked if it would make her uncomfortable for me to sleep with him. I already knew that it was a huge betrayal to sleep with a friend's ex, but I wasn't sure about hookups. She immediately said that it was weird that I would even ask that. I apologized and told her that I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize out friendship, and would block him. She asked me why I matched with him, and I was honest. She told me that I was worth more than that and that I shouldn't seek validation from men. She said that she wasn't upset, and acted like everything was fine once we got to her apartment. 

 Her apartment was on the third floor and you could only get there by an outdoor stair rail. I brought in the groceries for her, but it took about four or five trips. I was exhausted by the time that I finished. When I'm bringing in the last of the groceries, I go up to her in the living room to tell her that I'm done, and she's loudly talking about me on the phone to her friend. Calling me a dirty hoe and a skank. She didn't even stop when she realized that I could hear her. I called a friend to come and pick me up, and when I got home, she had posted all over social media about being a girl's girl and sluts breaking girl code. 

 I was genuinely confused why she reacted like that. I didn't sleep with him or even meet up with him. I would have never done that without making sure that she was okay with it first. Also, why did she act like it was cool until after I finished busting my butt for her? This happened a few years ago, but it still bugs me sometimes.

 Okay, so I have a friend J (26F) who used to be my coworker and lately, she has been getting on my nerves.

I'm not sure if it's because she recently got back together with her ex (23M), who she cries over every time, or maybe I'm just a hater because ever since I started sharing my interests with her, she starts claiming she likes it too. It's really confusing to me at first because I used to invite her to watch the games with me and she always refuses and says, ""Not my thing."" She claims sports weren't her thing at all. I was cool with that, she likes to go on concerts and I like to watch hockey. 

This all started when I brought her to a game at the end of the regular season to cheer her up, because she was really sad at the time since she broke up with her ex. I wanted to take her mind off of her ex so we watched the game together at the arena. The whole time we were watching the game, she keeps taking videos and pictures (I didn't mind it) but I couldn't watch the game properly too because she wanted me to take pictures of her and with her. 

The next day however, color me surprise, now she's a true fan, is what she claims. (I was so confused but I was starting to feel irritated)

I told her I'm glad she enjoyed and thought, that's the end of it. Now, she keeps posting in her Instagram stories and buying jerseys as if she understands the game. She doesn't even know how many players are on the ice for fuck's sake. 

Then, she hits me up saying she got back together with the guy who constantly makes her cry because according to her, her parents wanted them back together. 

So now it's extra frustrating.

Because to me, I wanted to support her decisions but at the same time, I can't support people who don't make grown adult decisions. Like what the hell do you mean your parents still make decisions for you? I don't know if I could tolerate more of this drama to be honest.

It's so annoying. I feel guilty because I shouldn't be annoyed? I don't know. I feel like I'm a bad friend. I just want to go back to how our friendship was before, where she likes what she likes and she can leave me alone with what I like.

",No A-holes here,2024-04-24,"AITA for treating my dad like a stranger?  My dad (m50) has been a provider, I (f20) always had what I needed, financially. But emotionally he never tried to get close, open up or even ask about how my life is going.

 Not only that, he will only give positive comments when I‚Äôve done something really big, like the time that I had a big talk at my university and everyone were impressed by it.

178,1cbqj3g,AITA for trying to get my roommate evicted ,"Get ready because it‚Äôs long. My roommate (23F) and I (20 F) moved in to a small two bedroom last fall. We were randomly matched, it was my second year in college and I didn‚Äôt really have all that many friends. We had met before we moved into the apartment just to see if we got along and we told each other a bit about ourselves. I told my roommate (let‚Äôs call her Lucy) that I had a dog and was moving in with him, I‚Äôd paid all the fees and rent to keep him there and found out she was moving in with her dog too. 

 We move in together and the dogs meet and immediately get along. About two weeks into living together I was still so anxious of letting my dog into the common area that I would leave him locked in my room when I would go run an errand or leave to a class. Lucy would keep her dog in the living area when she was away because she didn‚Äôt want her dog to ruin any of her things and I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I heard a loud crash outside my room where my dog and I were settling for a small nap and I come to see her dog hiding behind the couch and my tv shattered on the floor. Her dog had been chewing on the table runner I put over the plain grey console to make it look cute and tugged it too far. 

Lucy was working part time at a cafe and was a full time student in her senior year. She would also spend the night some nights with her boyfriend and leave me with her dog after politely asking and being reassured I was ok with it. After all, I wanted to be a good roommate since we were still acclimating. She was busy and stressed and didn‚Äôt pay that much attention to her dog, but when I told her about what happened and showed the pictures to prove it, she wanted to give me her smaller regular tv. After a small argument she finally agreed to replace my tv. 

Lucy‚Äôs dog only became worse at chewing. She would jump onto the kitchen counter and grab my food when we were away and would eat it, destroy toys and leave messes. She also shed a lot, so we would constantly have to pick up after her. Slowly, Lucy stopped being so apologetic and a lot of things came into light for me as my patience wore thin. 

I‚Äôd had enough. I took all of my things and hid them in my room, Put all of my groceries in my mini fridge, stopped helping clean up after her dog and no longer made myself available to dog sit. I would avoid her under the guise of being busy but still was polite to avoid any further conflict.

Lucy ended up getting depressed and had her mom move in with us for a week. After the week, she left with her mom without a word and didn‚Äôt come back for 6 months. Now, she came back and brought back her dog and had her new bf stay with us while she settled in. I‚Äôd made myself at home with my decor etc and they‚Äôve been really disrespectful of my things. Again. She left yesterday to go to an air b&b with her bf and left her dog at our apartment for the next five days even though I told her I wouldn‚Äôt take care of it. AITA for trying to get her out?

179,1cbq2uh,AITA if I lie so my mom doesn‚Äôt get her driver‚Äôs license?,"My mom (72F) moved in with me (47) two years ago to help regulate her health (borderline diabetes and various other health problems). I‚Äôve got her health somewhat stabilized through her medicine (she refuses to change her habits) but she gets absentminded when her sugar levels are off. Recently the DMV required that she needed to renew her license and needed to take the written test again. I took her in and she didn‚Äôt pass the DMV eye exam, so she needed a doctor‚Äôs approval to move forward to testing.

I took her today and the doctor said she only needs to have one eye that is good enough to pass, which it seems like she does so the doctor passed her. I was hoping she wouldn‚Äôt pass because I‚Äôm concerned about her driving when her sugar levels are off and she gets absentminded. She‚Äôs got a slight gambling addiction, so she would only be driving to the casinos or to the store. 

If I was honest with her and told her I didn‚Äôt think she should be driving anymore she would make my life terrible at home and we would blame me and try to get one of her friends to help her get her license. I‚Äôm considering just telling her she didn‚Äôt pass just so she doesn‚Äôt have to go through the written and behind the wheel test (which she probably won‚Äôt pass either - English is not her 1st language and she gets super nervous with people of authority), and I‚Äôm worried about other people‚Äôs safety with her on the road. Her friends currently take her shopping or to the casinos, and either I or my kids drive her around any other time. Would I be the A-Hole if I lied and told her she didn‚Äôt pass, to make it easier and safer for everyone, including me?

Follow Up: Thanks for all of your thoughts YTA and NTA. My family has been telling me to just lie to her so that she doesn‚Äôt have the opportunity to get her license and won‚Äôt potentially hurt other people on the road, but it doesn‚Äôt seem quite right and I understand both sides of the thoughts everyone has shared. I don‚Äôt care if she gambles, it‚Äôs her money and she can do whatever she wants with it (I pay for all of her other bills, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt get paid). My mom is like another one of my kids and I‚Äôve been helping her with her responsibilities since my dad passed away 20+years ago. I love her but when she ‚Äúhas‚Äù to gamble, she focuses on it so much that she forgets to take her phone, forgets her meds, or forgets to eat or drink, and I‚Äôm just worried about her hurting herself or someone else. She doesn‚Äôt listen to my concerns about her health, but I agree she is a grown woman and can decide those things for herself.

I‚Äôm decided to tell her that her dr signed off on her form and I will take her to the DMV for her written test, but that I also don‚Äôt think she should be driving. She‚Äôs stubborn, mean and feisty, and no one else in the family will take her so she‚Äôs stuck with me and I can continue to suck it up and deal with her being mean to me if she doesn‚Äôt get her license renewed.

180,1cbpyw5,WIBTA if i decide to not call one of my ex bsf to our mutual friend group gatherings?,"I (17F) have another friend Zoe (17F).
Zoe was my best friend before it all went down the drain, because of her. I will be brief about what happened and why we aren't friends anymore.

Zoe has had crushes on her friend's crushes, including mine, she has also flirted with other guys when she was dating someone else which eventually led to their break up. So naturally when I broke up with my ex i asked her to maintain distance since she's my best friend i expected her to understand, and i know they were friends but her and I have been friends way longer than I had even dated my ex. 

She did not listen despite me telling her multiple and i mean MULTIPLE times, not to mention she wasn't there for me when we broke up because her ex that she cheated on had moved on and was dating someone else, and to cope with that fact she said and i quote ""i need male validation bro so I'm gonna hang out with XYZ since he has a crush on me"", so she was never there for me either. 

But despite all this I still gave her a chance and i would ask her to hang out, she obviously declined because she had other male friends to hang out with. I gave up and stopped talking to her, we fought, we ""sorted"" it out, she put a story about me on her insta saying crap about me and blocked me. 

I did not care because why should I. So recently I called my friends to hang out and did not invite her  because 1)she has me blocked so i couldn't contact her because I did decide to call her, 2) none of my other friends except 1-2 like her. We had a bunch of fun and she saw that since one of our friends called her downstairs to meet for a bit. She saw this and approached us and talked. She later texted everyone asking them to call her next time and that our fight (mine and her's) shouldn't affect their friendship and that she doesn't hold a grudge against me anymore and she regrets the way things went down with us.

Well now yesterday one of my friend's saw her story which had a reel saying ""once upon a time came from a bitch that would backstab friendships for a boy"" and she wrote ""peak (my name) behaviour?"". Obviously this pissed me off because we still have mutual friends that follow her and it won't create a good impression but on the other hand she always does things like this so I don't really care because people don't believe her.

So my friends and i were planning to go to the amusement park and i was wondering if i would be the asshole if I decide to not call her to such a big plan?

My parents have a history of kicking me out when we have big enough fights. For example when I was psychotic they kicked me out and I had no money. They then called the cops and told them I was a danger to myself or others and got me a board of mental health. 

My parents had guardianship for a while but that was legally nulled after a while. I now have full medical-legal rights. The psych said I had ‚Äúsubstance induced psychosis.‚Äù 

My parents; however, took my psych meds and won‚Äôt let me have them for fear that I would misuse them. They now pick up all my prescriptions. They also have a tracker in my car and regularly check it. They say if I want my meds I have to move out. (They give me 7 days of my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù meds at a time but won‚Äôt give my any of my trazodone for sleep)

 We also agreed (after my parents found me with Kava and a vape) that they should control my money (at least for the last 5 months). They now have 5500 dollars that they dole out to me on an ‚Äúas needed basis.‚Äù I work 50 hours a week and my checks go straight to my dad‚Äôs bank account. They have a history of saying additionally ‚Äúyou have to let us check your bank transactions or else we will kick you out.‚Äù 

Today I wanted a trazodone to help me sleep and my dad said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just wait an hour and then wake me up if you‚Äôre not asleep‚Äù 

I told them I rescind any agreement that we had regarding control of my meds or money (I have done this several times but they just blow it off and life goes on). Tonight my mom said ‚Äújust move out all I want is for you to leave because you‚Äôre not appreciative of all that we give to you.‚Äù 

I told them I would move out if I had access to my money (moving out has been a topic of conversation for the last 3+ months that is sort of a Cold War at this point). 

Insults were exhanged and feelings were hurt. I have no way of getting my rights back short of calling the police or stealing my stuff back. 

I‚Äôm not a neckbeard that will never move out, I lived on my own for 5 years, I have been talking about moving out on my own for QUITE A WHILE. Every time I get excited about it, my parents never give me the money for a down payment or anything.

I get into fights every now and then with the same solutions, we end up forgetting about the fight and ‚Äúgetting along.‚Äù I said this is a conflict of whose will gets made and I want mine to be made, my parents scoffed at this and called me immature. I plan to go to Grad school soon (I am accepted into a masters program in another city for fall 2024) so it would be hard to get a lease for like 3 months but I can probably rent a room in someone‚Äôs house. 

Am I the asshole for causing so many fights? 
Am I even the one ‚Äústarting‚Äù these fights?",No A-holes here,2024-04-24,"AITA I‚Äôm 27, I live at with my parents, my parents took my psych meds and won‚Äôt give them back. I got angry at them and they complained I am starting a fight. (27M) So here‚Äôs some back story. 

I used to live on my own but after my fianc√© left me, I spiraled out of control using drugs and became psychotic.

186,1cbpnqw,AITA for arguing with my mother?,"I (18M) recently got into an argument with my mother. To add some background, yesterday morning my mom was driving me to school and as we were getting there she told me she had to speak to me about something. I asked about what and she went into a slight rant about me and how I spend my time outside of school. 
My schedule consists of waking up at 6:00(I wake up early for reasons I won‚Äôt specify but they are for reasons my mom enforces), go to school from 8:30-1:30, get a ride back home from a friend from 1:30-2:00, wait for my mother to drop me off at the gym and stay from 2:00-4:00, get back home at 5:00, eat until 5:30, rest till 6:30, apply for scholarships or hw from 6:30-7:30, shower 7:30-8:00, and rest until I go to sleep at around 11:00 or 12:00.
My mom said that she dislikes the amount of time I spend on my phone (somewhat understandable I do honestly want to read more), the time I spend on video games (only played like an hour or two weekdays cause of scholarships and only on Wednesdays when I play with a friend or the weekend), that it does not seem like I actually care about my future, and that I don‚Äôt pressure my dad enough to fix her old car for me (don‚Äôt have my license yet). 
She also got annoyed that I chose another individual from my fathers side to be my godfather for my confirmation since my first communion godmother was also from that side (I‚Äôm just getting confirmed so that my future wedding and spouse do not have to wait for me to do that and unlike some of my family on my mothers side I know my cousin doesn‚Äôt care that I don‚Äôt believe in God and loves me the same). Finally she said all my ‚Äúproblems‚Äù would be fixed if I just believed in God and that he would give me a purpose. I know some people believe and live fruitful lives, but even when I believed I had the same problems so it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Forgot to mention that I am the president and founder of the Super Smash Bros club at my school and every Tuesday I do that instead of the gym. I practice at home when I can and take it to school every day. When she saw me put it in my bag she looked at me with the slightest look of disgust, and asked me if I really was ‚Äúgoing to take that again today‚Äù? I‚Äôm not slacking either I‚Äôm in the top 4% of my class and never play during class time.
Anyways, I got out the car as soon as we arrived to school and didn‚Äôt really speak to her until today. Before I went upstairs my mother asked me if I was mad; I told her (in an angry tone but NOT screaming at her) that of course I‚Äôm mad because she said that unless I‚Äôm in school or applying for scholarships I‚Äôm just wasting time. I then left for my room to which she chased me to and said that if I felt that way it‚Äôs probably because I should reassess my life choices, that I was a spoiled child, and to never speak to her like that again (not once did I scream at her). I just said fine and shut the door when she left. So AITA?

I coldly said ‚Äúdo not tell me what to do‚Äù because I‚Äôm 25 years old, I‚Äôm not a child. lol she knows this I don‚Äôt need to explain that part and she blew up on me and is refusing to speak to me now. I‚Äôm at a total loss of what to do and don‚Äôt know if I should apologize to my mom or stand my ground this time. (My mom often displaces her hurt with anger) it‚Äôs confusing to me.
