0,1cc9wh7,AITA For Leaving my Band Suddenly?,"Hey y'all, so a day ago I (F23) sent my band a long text in our gc about me leaving the group. Currently it was myself on drums, our singer (M26, and our guitarist (M22).There were 3 points. They were that a) I had been having some mixed feelings about the group and chemistry, the singer and guitarist were getting into fights about logistics and rehearsals often before our last major gig. I'm trans, and some jokea and comments from our singer have rubbed me the wrong way in the past (nothing major like blatant misgendering, to be clear). Additionally, I had been running into other musicians that have been with this group before (they went through 4 or 5 other drummers before me) and they told me I should be wary.
B) I was realizing that my solo project that I had been doing for a few years before which I had put down for this was ultimately more creatively fulfilling, and I was missing dedicating time to it. 
C) As my plate is filling up, (I also do anti-war and lgbt-activism here in Louisiana) I didn't feel like I could push that aside to make time for band and solo work.

The reaction to the text was very negative, insisting I should have made a call. When I called the singer he called me a coward and a liar for being indecisive/and not making my trepidation clear enough before this point. He also accused me and one of the other queer musicians he played with before that I talked to of trying to cancel him. He said the band would probably be done and that I fucked it all. 

He sent me a message later that day telling me to never talk to him again, even though I tried to be clear in my message I didn't have any I'll will towards them of their music. Today at work, the singer, who is on the same job site as me, avoided me and even hid my bowl and chopsticks I usually use for lunch in the break room from me 

I understand that I didn't make my trepidation and ensuing burnout super clear to them before this message and it probably came as shock. I want to recognize that feeling blindsided and hurt by it is valid. However I'd only been with the band for four or so months and we'd only played three gigs. I was not expecting to yelled at over the phone and harassed at work. AITA and getting my just desserts? ",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-04-24,"AITA For Leaving my Band Suddenly?

1,1cc4mwq,AITA for not helping my friend in their time of need?,"Hi. So, this issue is actually a little old, but I could really use some perspective.

A few years ago, I had a best friend who was going through a breakup from an unhealthy relationship. Apparently the breakup was one sided; my friend didn‚Äôt WANT to breakup, but his boyfriend did.
Anyways, said friend (we were long distance) would call me every single day after we got off school, listen to sad music while on call, and just sit there and cry. He would tell me his life was over, he couldn‚Äôt go on without his partner, etc. over, and over. This went on for weeks. Watching him suffer was breaking my heart, and I did everything I could to be there for him as much as possible, including setting aside my own issues and schoolwork.
Finally, one day, I had a big issue pop up in my personal life, and I was struggling to hold the weight of his emotions and mine. It was sucking the life out of me. I told him that for the time being, I needed the sitting on the phone in silence while he listened to sad music to stop, and I couldn‚Äôt hold his emotions alongside mine. He got pretty upset, and reminded me that I promised I‚Äôd always be there for him. I acknowledged the promise, told him I loved and cared, but in order to keep the promise, I needed to help myself first, as I felt like I was already drowning on my own.
Some time later, I let him know that I was doing better, and would be more than happy to help if he needed me. He acknowledged my statement, but proceeded to stop talking about issues. He would pretend to be okay, when I knew he wasn‚Äôt. I tried multiple times to let him know I was all good, and ready to help. 
A couple months later, I asked him why he felt like he couldn‚Äôt talk to me. He told me that it was because of when I shocked him by telling him I couldn‚Äôt hold the weight of his problems. He told me that because of his trauma with women, he couldn‚Äôt distinct my ‚Äúfemale behavior‚Äù from abusive behavior (I‚Äôm non-binary). He said he couldn‚Äôt trust me just backtracking on my word.
I apologized, and asked how we could fix the issue. Instead of coming up with solutions, he just repeated his feelings and told me he couldn‚Äôt trust me. I acknowledged it, apologized again, and asked once more if there was a way we could fix the issue. He, once again, just repeated himself, and even told me i had reminded him of his mother. 
After a few tries, I became defensive. I told him that no matter what I said or did, he was just coming after me. I told him that I wanted to fix the problem, but I genuinely no longer knew how, since he wasn‚Äôt giving me anything other than blame.
Finally, I ended up being the one to come up with the solution on my own.

I‚Äôm writing this because I wonder if perhaps I was the asshole for asking for some emotional space. He was extremely heartbroken, so maybe I should have just sucked it up and continued to sit in his grief with him. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten defensive.

3,1cbs9yf,AITA for refusing to let my dad touch me (affectionately not inappropriately),"AITA for not letting my dad touch me? My father (42 Male) has always been physically affectionate because it‚Äôs one of his love languages. He cares so much about having a close relationship with me and my younger sister and about being present in our lives. But I don‚Äôt like it and it really hurts his feelings. 

When I (14 non-binary) was younger I had long, naturally curly, hair and I didn‚Äôt know how to keep it from getting tangled. When my dad would run his fingers through my hair (kind of a petting thing) he‚Äôd snag tangles then try to pull them out. This really hurt, so I‚Äôd push him away or tell him to stop but he told me that refusing it made him feel hurt and unappreciated so I cut my hair short in 5th grade. 

After realizing that I like many aspects of the style I kept it and haven‚Äôt had long hair since. When I mentioned a while ago that I cut it to get my dad to stop hurting me he got really upset at me and told me a little more about his childhood and how his parents never cared and why he tries so hard with us. I felt awful. We had a great conversation and I apologized, but then he moved in to hug me. I put my arms in front of me and said ‚Äúno‚Äù kind of panicked tone (this was a knee-jerk reaction, not conscious) and then my dad left the house angrily and slammed the door.

When I‚Äôm emotional, my dad offers me a hug and I‚Äôm supposed to take it, even if I feel worse, because my dad really wants to comfort me. My dad has explained how his parents were super removed and unresponsive and he said he never wants us to feel that way, because he is a super great dad.

After this I reflected and realized how much I hate it when I‚Äôm touched. Since then, I‚Äôve tried to set boundaries with my dad, but I can‚Äôt tell him not to touch me at all, obviously because he‚Äôll ask why and I can‚Äôt tell him it makes my skin crawl. When I try to set boundaries like ‚Äòdon‚Äôt touch me when I‚Äôm emotional‚Äô or ‚Äòtell me before you hug me‚Äô those boundaries aren‚Äôt respected. 
So I‚Äôve started saying ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù clearly when he tries now. He‚Äôll try to ask for specific boundaries but he ignores them within the hour, and he‚Äôs equally offended when I remind him of a boundary as when I set one.

5,1cbos45,AITA for not attending my friend‚Äôs graduation?,"As graduation season approaches, I've found myself caught in a bit of a bind. I (21F) am graduating college next month. I go to a large university and we have multiple ceremonies depending on which college you‚Äôre in.

Recently, my friend, who is also graduating (22F), expressed disappointment that I won't be attending her ceremony. To give some context, we're both graduating on the same day but at different times‚Äîher ceremony is later in the day, while mine is earlier. On that day, I've already made dinner reservations with my family to celebrate, coinciding with the time of her graduation.

I explained to her that I can't cancel my plans with my family to attend her ceremony, but from her perspective, she was hoping I would be there. I think there might have been a misunderstanding because we hadn't really discussed our graduation plans in depth before this. Now, she's upset with me, and some of our mutual friends are siding with her, arguing that attending each other's graduations is expected. However, some of them won't graduate until next year, which makes it easier for them to attend multiple ceremonies without their own conflicting schedules.

I feel stretched thin with everything going on, and with my family visiting, I want to prioritize celebrating with them. Plus, I'm not sure what they would do during her ceremony, which could be over an hour and a half long‚ÄîI wouldn't want to leave them alone, especially since they've traveled a long way to support me.

If I had more time, I would love to be there for my friend, but realistically, it's just not feasible to do everything in one day. It's my graduation too, and I want to make it special.

6,1cbolj9,WIBTA if I forced these RV people to leave?,"Every few months, an RV parks about 30 feet from my house in a pretty quiet neighborhood. I don't know these people. I believe it is an older couple who drive their RV to come visit their family that lives in the area. They stay anywhere from a few days to a month. The issue I have with it, is that they run their engine on idle from around 5:00 p.m. until 9:00 a.m. - all night long - to keep their electricity running. It's a large vehicle, so the engine is not quiet. It's not super loud, but it can be heard from anywhere inside my house. It's a low rumbling sound that disturbs our family's sleep and gives us a headache. It's about the volume level of a ceiling fan on the highest setting, only low and bassy. 

I want to stress that they are not on my property. They are street parked on a public road. They aren't trespassing. The only thing they are doing that's against city policy is parking in the same spot for more than 48 hours. 

I've politely spoken to them about it. They were polite too, but they made it clear they weren't going to stop this behavior. They get too cold if they stop their engine. I could potentially get local police to enforce the city code and get them to move, but then they'll just park in front of someone else's house and bother them.

7,1cbodz2,AITA for not wanting to buy my daughter the dress she loved?,"I (38M) have a 14YO daughter but am no longer with her mom (34F).  We have not been together in 9+ years and have 50/50 custody.  Since my daughter has been in middle school, I have spoken with both her mother and her about wanting to be involved when it comes to school dances, and it would be nice if the parent who will have her the night of the dance was the one who got the dress and helped her get ready.  But every dance, her mom has gotten her dress and then insisted because she got the dress she be the one to get her ready - interrupting the time my daughter is scheduled to be with me.  She has even gone as far as to refuse to let my daughter come over the weekend of a dance, even if it is my time.

My daughter is now coming up on her last middle school dance.  Again, she is scheduled to be at my house for this, but again her mom took her shopping without talking to me about it.  The dress she ‚Äúfell in love with‚Äù fits the Under the Sea theme, but is $400, which I think is too much for a middle school formal.   I expressed this to her mother, explaining once shoes and make up and other things are factored in she will be spending well over $500 and it seems excessive for the occasion and sets unreasonable expectations.  Her response was to say I never want to pay for anything and it‚Äôs worth every penny and I have no business giving her a hard time about wanting to make our daughter happy.  AITA?

Some notes:

* she did ask me to contribute and I never said I wouldn‚Äôt.  I did tell her I would only contribute what I consider to be a reasonable amount.
* I pay a small child support, but we have a 50/50 split and I have had to ask her mother to stop bringing things to my house (like water bottles) for her because I am more than capable and willing to provide for her when she is here.
* When other expenses come up, like school trips, I have helped pay toward them.  I am in now way trying to get out of supporting my daughter.

I (38M) have a 14YO daughter but am no longer with her mom (34F).  We have not been together in 9+ years and have 50/50 custody.  Since my daughter has been in middle school, I have spoken with both her mother and her about wanting to be involved when it comes to school dances, and it would be nice if the parent who will have her the night of the dance was the one who got the dress and helped her get ready.  But every dance, her mom has gotten her dress and then insisted because she got the dress she be the one to get her ready - interrupting the time my daughter is scheduled to be with me.  She has even gone as far as to refuse to let my daughter come over the weekend of a dance, even if it is my time.

My daughter is now coming up on her last middle school dance.  Again, she is scheduled to be at my house for this, but again her mom took her shopping without talking to me about it.  The dress she ‚Äúfell in love with‚Äù fits the Under the Sea theme, but is $400, which I think is too much for a middle school formal.   I expressed this to her mother, explaining once shoes and make up and other things are factored in she will be spending well over $500 and it seems excessive for the occasion and sets unreasonable expectations.  Her response was to say I never want to pay for anything and it‚Äôs worth every penny and I have no business giving her a hard time about wanting to make our daughter happy.  AITA?

Some notes:

* she did ask me to contribute and I never said I wouldn‚Äôt.  I did tell her I would only contribute what I consider to be a reasonable amount.
* I pay a small child support, but we have a 50/50 split and I have had to ask her mother to stop bringing things to my house (like water bottles) for her because I am more than capable and willing to provide for her when she is here.
* When other expenses come up, like school trips, I have helped pay toward them.  I am in now way trying to get out of supporting my daughter.

We are relatively close in the sense that his dad usually brings him and his siblings down to visit with us once or twice a year, and when they are here, I am usually with them in some capacity every day and I will take him and his siblings to do fun things and it'll be just us. 

I really would like to work out going, but my schedule is insane (I work two jobs, own a home, am a full-time student, have two dogs, and am in a relationship) and I have a lot of debt and don't want to add to it to go.   


Here is where the issue lies with me: travel. It is an 11-hour drive and the closest major airport is about 4 hours away and my uncle has already told us that he will not come to get us if we fly in there. My mom only wants to go from Thursday-Monday and neither one of us wants to drive our cars (I have a valid reason - my AC does not work, my mom is just being difficult about using her truck). So my only options are driving 11 hours and wasting a shit ton of money on gas and a rental car, spending $500+ on flights to a small town airport, or flying into a major airport and still having to rent a car and drive. None of which I want to spend the money or time on for a 4-day trip if I am being honest.

Significant other recently unfairly lost her job. We both make low six figures, and are new to this income, both having this pay for around a year; our savings are low. 

We are about to move out of our place to a new one with a new lease. We've begun a large argument.  She believes that I should handle the rent and moving costs because she will burn through her savings. I was willing to do this, but I feel she should, when and if she has the means, pay back into my account. 

She thinks this is wrong, that if I care about her, I should support her without any expectation of reimbursement, or that it shows a lack of trust to expect her to help pay me back. That she has friends whose so's are holding down costs in similar situations with no expectation. 

She says, ""I would burn through my whole savings."" Which is exactly what I will have to do if i pay for everything. But that's not what I'm asking her to do, I'm saying I will pay, and she can reimburse when she can, if she can. 

This move will cost a lot, and we have two months of rent to pay in our current place still. I'm saying, I will pay, just when you are back on the wagon (in likely a 6 figure job (and likely very soon)) pay me back when you can. 

 I feel like the idea of me paying 15k over the next two months and her getting a job and thinking it's wrong to pay me back, or that I'm a bad person for thinking she should, when and if she can is unfair. It feels completely reasonable to me to expect this. 

And too, I had lost my job a bit back, and she maintained hers, and I continued to pay rent and bills fairly. There was not an offer from her to take on the demands. 

I feel like I understand the position of, well aren't we going to be together? What does it matter? But then feel that is a flippable position. If we're going to be together, it shouldn't matter to reimburse into my account. 

I am pretty much dead set in my position. I can't understand how she would think it's fair that I take the burden with no expectation to reimburse, which I think I have fairly laid out as, when and if able.

The afternoon I moved in, one of my neighbours came up to the steps (each apartment has a little front area, and mine faces the carpark). She introduced herself, single mom with a 4 year old daughter and gave me a small succulent to say welcome. I was very appreciative, said thank you and we spoke for a few minutes.

I work three days from home, and am usually home in the evening after work and at night.

It is nice, but I do prefer to keep to myself, and often I'm in my baggy tee or not dressed for visitors, I have to kind of make myself presentable in under a minute with no notice.

This latest instance, they showed up around 7pm. The daughter had made some kind of drawing and wanted to drop it off. I'd had a long day (was in a giant sweater, looking a mess but insanely comfy, ice cream on the couch, watching a film) saw them through the window, had to quickly jump up, put on shorts, and greet them at the door.

Said thank you as always, daughter wanted to come in, see what I was watching. Nothing terrible, just a bit too grown up for a 4 year old. I politely said, look, thank you but I'm really not in the mood tonight and could they please leave.

We tend to argue on again off again with there usually being a mutual understanding of what we individually did wrong, lately it‚Äôs all been pushed that im the one in the wrong. 

Flash forward to tonight. she mentioned being hungry several times and naturally I offered to make her something or go heat up some leftovers for her since she had a long day. She tells me that no, she doesn‚Äôt want anything we have at the house. i once again offer her something we have at home and she again says no. I don‚Äôt have a lot of money right now so ordering out for us isn‚Äôt an option.

 I get a little upset at this, explain how im feeling,  and grab the leftovers we had in the fridge to go heat up for her as i know that she‚Äôd forget to eat if i didnt make something now. I bring her food back to her and she tells me to set it down, and then asks me why the second we get home i have to ‚Äòjump down her throat.‚Äô I once again repeat why I‚Äôm upset about this (being that her saying shes hungry and refusing to eat anything we have is not okay or healthy) and I leave to my space.

 She begins texting me about how I ruined her night and how I should stop doing things for her flat out. I argue back that I dont see how me wanting her to eat something we had at home ruined her night, and she starts yelling at me that im an asshole and i ruined her night and that i should just stop doing things for her. 

All I wanted to do was help my friend out, am i the asshole?

EDIT 1: She has texted me again telling me to go fuck myself after I left the house to go to my quiet place and calmed down, she knows where said quiet place is and so far has made no motion to come speak to me in person.

18,1cbmyhe,AITA for ignoring my emotionally distant father after trying to forge a relationship for years?,"Am I (22f) the asshole for intentionally ignoring my father's (47m) attempts to contact me after trying to forge a relationship with him for years. 

This is a burner account since idk if anyone I know uses reddit, but recently I've been having a lot of guilt surrounding my relationship, or lack of relationship with my father.

For some background, the man was rarely there for me growing up. I have very little memories of him, or rather, not many good ones at least. He was always drunk, fighting with my narcissistic mother, and I witnessed some pretty messed up stuff because of them.

I have a lot of trauma from my parents, but for years I still ached for a relationship with them. I had been taking care of myself independently since around 15-16, and my mother passed when I was 17, opening the door for my father to come back in my life. I was apprehensive since he had been just as, if not more, unreliable than my mother. I had thought since I was still a minor, he would have no choice but to take me in.

Well... that didn't happen. Shortly after my mother passed, he left me to live alone in that house, the same house I saw my mother dead in. Over the years he has done a lot to hurt me, a lot of screwing me over, and I have voiced my hurt and concerns. I can't go into detail due to character limits, but those closest to me have assured me that my feelings are valid (I work in mental health and my friends all do as well, so we call out bad behavior in each other often out of tough love)

Ive been trying my whole life to have a relationship with him, mostly even more from 17-21, but over the last few months, I can't find it in me to even try to have a relationship with him. He takes care of his new wife's kids better than he ever took care of us, and I really can't stomach to be around it anymore. I have struggled with very bad mental health in the past, a lot of it trauma related, and I have found he makes it worse due to him exhibiting behaviors that caused my trauma (something he is very well aware of)

I'm 22 now, living completely on my own, with no ties to him anymore. I have a stable job that I don't hate, possibly starting a new one that will pay me more and allow me to go to school finally. I'm in a healthy happy relationship with a great guy, and have a small but loving friend group. I've been very happy recently.

The issue now comes in with my father suddenly wanting to make contact with me. I haven't answered since he's appearing to be repeating the same behaviors of love bombing after months of ignoring me, and more. I haven't really spoken to him since around last summer due to him ignoring me, and my decision this winter to go NC. 

I feel very guilty over cutting him out, but with all my past experiences with him, no matter how much I try to speak to him about how his behaviors hurt me, he'll never change. Even the thought of talking/dealing with him is bringing me a sense of dread and making me sick with anxiety.

19,1cbmx8c,AITA for not hearing my wife calling for me?,"This morning my wife said she was going to take our kid to the playground after Family Quiet Time (1-2 hours after lunch where we all sit on our butts while kiddo naps/doesn't nap) so I could cook us dinner in peace. This is not an uncommon occurrence now that it's spring.

95% of the time, I spend Quiet Time in my basement office with noise-cancelling earbuds in. She knows that I hear practically nothing except what I'm playing/watching with these earbuds. She knows this is by design. She knows I will typically miss text messages during this time unless I am specifically waiting for them; she is not a fan of this fact, as she almost always texts me if she needs something. I've told her multiple times that I will never ignore her, and that if I haven't responded to a text, my door is always open.. I'm not clinging to my phone waiting for her to message me in our own home where I'm just a short staircase away. 

Today, however, was one of those days I *was* waiting for a text around the end of Quiet Time to say 'kid is awake' or whatever. (This is the job of the parent with the monitor or the kid: notify the other parent the kid is awake so it can be all hands on deck.) Like I was checking my phone every few minutes, and every time I heard something that remotely resembled our kid running or talking I took an earbud out for a moment to see if I was needed, ready to come up at a moment's notice. But no messages came and I heard nothing suspicious.

Then 3 minutes before I was about to come upstairs to start dinner / help get kiddo ready since I assumed the playground trip would be happening soon, my wife bursts into my office and is like ""what are you doing! I've been calling and shouting for you! We're leaving for the playground now and I wanted your help getting him ready! But now it's too late!"" I'm like.. baffled, firstly, because we typically don't holler for/at each other in this household. I explained I'd been waiting for her to text, was just about to come up, and heard literally nothing through *my noise-cancelling-by-design* earbuds. I also reminded her, as she reminds me when I think she's heard me but hasn't, that **if I didn't respond to her, I didn't hear her.** 

(This one-sided communication piece has come up many times. Essentially she puts the onus on me to be a good communicator: if she didn't hear me, it's my fault for not being clear or repeating myself; if I didn't hear her, it's my fault for not listening. Yes we have a marriage counsellor. No she doesn't use any of the techniques we learn in our sessions. Yes I'm aware this is a bad sign.)

Anyway she keeps berating me for being a bad communicator etc.  as we go upstairs. I take a deep breath, trying to figure out what she's really feeling, and decide to apologize for being unavailable and frustrating her. No dice; she leaves with kiddo and I make dinner.

21,1cbmsdz,"AITA for Not Paying My Friend Rent for a SLEEPOVER?
","Me (18F) and my Friend (19F) lets call her Shay, have been friends for two years, since high school, we would have sleepovers all the time, which might seem a bit strange for some people our age we still found it fun! But it was always great!

When we were first friends we both lived with our parents and we would make plans around going to each others houses. Every time Shay would come over to my house for a sleepover she would bring food of some kind, a treat of something for us to share, no matter what she would bring something even if it meant going to the store and coming an hour late.

I would try and bring snacks when I could/remembered but I most of the time just bought stuff for the both of us if we went out instead. Recently Shay started renting an apartment with a roommate who I have only really seen once, but we still decided to continue with our sleepovers.

While she was moving in we had most of the sleepovers at my place while she unpacked, but then we finally had the chance to have one at her new apartment! I went over and had a sleepover as normal just having fun and goofing off watching movies and all that. I did not bring any snacks to this sleepover, nor did we really go out and buy anything. I thought it was fine.

It was a long weekend so I stayed two nights, It all seemed normal until I started to leave and say good bye. But then Shay came up to me and asked me to pay for rent during the time that I was there. I was shocked, it was a two night sleepover!

She wanted 50$ for while I was there, it was because I ate her food and spent time in her apartment, her roommate paid rent and so did Shay, and because I stayed there I would need to help too. I instantly said no, and that it was crazy. I barely ate anything and she would come over to sleepovers at my place all the time, and before I never had to do anything like this.

I asked her why it was different now and why she doesn't pay me too! But her argument is that she brings food every time to my house and its not my house, its my parent's. That this is her own place that she has to rent during university and she can't just keep free loaders on her budget. If someone stayed here it was their responsibility to help pay for the water, electricity and food used.

I said I wasn't going to pay and stormed out. She still hasn't messaged me back and wont respond to my calls. I feel bad now, and I think it is kind of silly to get in a fight over 50$ especially after such a long friendship. True 25$ a night isn't bad, and I could pay for it... But it's the fact that she didn't tell me before I slept over!

So... AITA for not paying? Should I go back and apologize for getting upset and just give her the money and have sleepovers only at my place now? I don't know if I am in the right or wrong here, my sister says that I should just pay her and keep the friendship instead of having it strained over something dumb... What do you guys think?

She went on about how it‚Äôll make my parents upset if I don‚Äôt stay at the house with them, and I always make things into a whole ordeal.

I don‚Äôt try to make a scene, but it always ends up that way because I don‚Äôt have the same values and beliefs as them. I don‚Äôt mock them for going to church or argue with them about politics. They can do whatever they want, I would just love to be left out of it and not berated. 


TLDR: my family and I have different values, and I don‚Äôt want to start an argument about it by bringing my boyfriend in town

Our house, he had 10 years before I entered the relationship and had been taking care of solo he has been trying to renovate but being a single dad had struggled to pull together the extra funds to update anything but now we are expecting we are looking for a new place because the current one is only two bedrooms and quite small not even close to being big enough for a family of four.

We can have the baby in our room for a short while but we have a maximum of two years before the baby will be mobile and will start to require a separate room and I absolutely would not expect his older daughter to share a room with a toddler that's just not fair and not an option. 

I've been sending him links to places that are bigger within our price range but he always finds something wrong ""the kitchen needs updating""  or ""the bathroom needs redoing"" "" the area isn't great"" 

I told him that these houses are in better condition than his current house and he can't afford to be picky when the tiles are falling off the kitchen walls and the bathroom has a shower curtain as a door.

27,1cbl9m4,AITA for telling my cousin her friend can‚Äôt have a dog?,"This is a little long so sorry in advance!

To start this out I‚Äôll give a little background. My (21F) dog had an accidental litter of GSD/Husky mixes about 6 months ago and we were able to give the dogs to homes we thought were great.

This happened two days ago when one of the owners contacted me saying she could not keep the dog due to her not having time for her and asked if I could pick her up that day. It was extremely last minute and I did not have room at my house due to having my own pets so I had to quickly find someone to take her. This ended up being my grandparents.

After I got her situated at my grandparents I asked around my family and friends to see if anyone maybe knew someone who would like a dog (after I vetted them of course) and got an answer from a few people. One of these was my cousin (28F) who said she had a friend and she would ask him if he would like the dog that was the end of the conversation. I finally hear back from her and she has been conversing with this person on her own and setup a meeting. I tell her that‚Äôs fine he can meet her but I need to be there so I‚Äôll pick her up and she replies back asking why I‚Äôm being guarded and controlling. This struck me as odd because as soon as I picked up this dog she became my responsibility and I need to see where she‚Äôll be going.

We get around to the time of the meeting and the dog is very skittish which is odd as she was not skittish at all when I picked her up or towards my grandparents. She is flinching everytime the man comes near her and is letting him pat her but keeps pulling away. After a little while a few people pull up and I can tell she‚Äôs getting antsy cause 4 people just flooded out of this car including little kids which she is not accustomed to.

During this interaction, she keeps coming back towards me and eventually she ‚Äònips‚Äô the child on the hand. She has bitten before but only when she got spooked and she was in a new place so we didn‚Äôt fault her. During the whole meeting I just was not convinced this was a right fit they didn‚Äôt have the backyard fully fenced,immediately talked about a shock collar and only were talking to my cousin who was there for some reason and not me. It all felt very odd and she also was not feeling it. My cousin kept saying things like ‚Äòshe likes it here‚Äô and ‚Äòshe gave you a love nip how cute‚Äô while not seeing how uncomfortable the dog was.

During the meeting I mention we have other people interested which I do after the guy says he‚Äôll take her Sunday (I never said yes to this) so he says ‚Äòoh okay let me know then‚Äô. The meeting ends and my cousin asks me to come over to her car and starts popping off about how I never told her that and she looks ridiculous to which I tell her I never had to tell her as the dog is mine to decide what to do with.

30,1cbkelg,AITA for refusing to attend my sister‚Äôs wedding? ,"Preface, I‚Äôm on mobile so I apologise for any mistakes. 

Earlier this month I came to the realisation that I have been acting very reactively to my family. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder so I make sure I try to really think about appropriate responses and reactions but despite my best efforts lately I‚Äôve definitely been slipping. 

A couple of weeks ago, I texted my mum and sister on the family group chat asking for some space because there were instances, intentional or not, that left me feeling hurt and abandoned by them. I tried to communicate that this space was for me to think about whether this is how I actually felt or if it was my BPD brain. I reassured that I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt anyone. I communicated that I knew how much they did for me and I wanted to right by them. 

My sister got really angry with me, and weaponised my relationship with my boyfriend and my want to regulate against me. She texted saying how much she‚Äôs done for me and doesn‚Äôt understand why I would need space. I agreed with her saying, I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. She ended up getting angrier with me and uninvited me to her wedding. 

Now my sister and I have not had the best relationship. She‚Äôs done some things to me growing up that have resulted in me being unable to trust, not being able to be comfortable in normal, consensual relationships and just overall be a anxious, angry and sad person. I try not to hold it against her, she was a kid too, but it gets difficult. I am trying to sort out the feelings through therapy. 

My sister has apologised through text, and I have also communicated boundaries through text. I don‚Äôt forgive her though. Life is easier without her and I don‚Äôt feel a loss when not talking to her. My mum and my grandma want me to attend the wedding and be the bigger person. They are want me to just move on, when I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even figure out what I feel. I don‚Äôt want to attend the wedding, not because I‚Äôm being malicious but because I don‚Äôt want to be sad and pretend everything is okay. I‚Äôm tired of being the bigger person.

I communicated that I knew how much they did for me and I wanted to right by them. 

My sister got really angry with me, and weaponised my relationship with my boyfriend and my want to regulate against me. She texted saying how much she‚Äôs done for me and doesn‚Äôt understand why I would need space. I agreed with her saying, I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. She ended up getting angrier with me and uninvited me to her wedding. 

Now my sister and I have not had the best relationship. She‚Äôs done some things to me growing up that have resulted in me being unable to trust, not being able to be comfortable in normal, consensual relationships and just overall be a anxious, angry and sad person. I try not to hold it against her, she was a kid too, but it gets difficult. I am trying to sort out the feelings through therapy. 

My sister has apologised through text, and I have also communicated boundaries through text. I don‚Äôt forgive her though. Life is easier without her and I don‚Äôt feel a loss when not talking to her. My mum and my grandma want me to attend the wedding and be the bigger person. They are want me to just move on, when I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even figure out what I feel. I don‚Äôt want to attend the wedding, not because I‚Äôm being malicious but because I don‚Äôt want to be sad and pretend everything is okay. I‚Äôm tired of being the bigger person.

31,1cbkbe0,AITA for not inviting 2 people in my friend group to my 16th,"I am turning 16 in a couple of months, I chose not to invite two people from my friend group, Sarah and Jason, because they've been spreading rumors about me.

Here's the backstory: Sarah and Jason were once close friends of mine. We shared secrets, laughed together, and generally had a great time. When they started spreading rumors about me. These weren't just harmless rumors; they were hurtful and damaging, and they caused a lot of drama within our friend group, such as me attempting to steal jason away from sarah and making moved on him ""I did none of the sort"".

Despite their toxic behavior, Sarah and Jason are still part of our friend circle. But I couldn't bring myself to include them in my birthday celebrations. It's supposed to be a day of happiness and joy, and I didn't want their negativity to ruin it for me.

My mom supported my decision and said I should surround myself with people who bring positivity into my life. But now, I'm worried about the repercussions. Will our friends understand why I didn't invite Sarah and Jason? Or will they think I'm being petty and exclusionary?
