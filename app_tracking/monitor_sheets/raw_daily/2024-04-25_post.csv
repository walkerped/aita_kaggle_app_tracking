0,1ccvgeh,"AITA for telling my daughter that ""alienation"" is not a good enough reason to change schools?","I'm (38F) going to be as straightforward as possible. My daughter (16F) started high school last September. She's an incredibly smart kid and got into the best high school in our city (and best nationwide ranked by admission grade; for reference her class had 26 spots up for grab & the lowest admission grade was 9.89 / 10). We were so proud of her. Now, this school also has a reputation as a hub for wealthy kids. We're solid middle class. We didn't think this would matter that much, since rich kids are still just kids at the end of the day and she should try being friends with everyone. She's quite a shy and quiet person. Even though she was nervous about the whole thing (to be expected), she also looked excited until high school actually began.

Immediately after the first day, she started complaining. She said the teachers are amazing, facilities are good, but her classmates... not the best experience to say the least. Apparently they're all from very rich families, and her and her benchmate are the only ""poor"" students in that class. She said they're not mean and don't bully anyone, and if she asks them about school related things they always respond nicely / willing to help; but they're extremely cliquey and essentially ignore her and her benchmate - it's as if they're invisible. She said she tried to talk with them a few times but they respond in a friendly but blunt matter, which doesn't leave room for conversation. She said academically they're extremely strong, but she feels the teachers are biased towards them 'cause they get private lessons by them (especially at math, physics and computer science). I considered getting her into these tutoring lessons as well, but the hourly rate these teachers charge is just too high for us. My husband and I made efforts to send her on 2 school trips so far (skiing in February and weekend sighting in December) and she said she was ignored the whole time. Basically she feels like a pariah, and said she sometimes goes into the bathroom and cries during breaks as she's lonely the entire day (she doesn't have a good relationship with her benchmate). 

Recently she came up to my husband and I and told us that she wanted to transfer to another school for 10th grade. We listed to what she had to say but told her no, because there's no serious reason for that. She's not bullied, the school has great prestige, the academics and teachers are great, etc. Just because people are distant doesn't mean it's enough for her to move. School is like a job, you go there to work and return home; making friends is not a requirement. She was very angry at us and said that we're deliberately obtuse and don't care about her mental health. I personally think she's just childish.

1,1ccuncv,"AITA for calling my dad ""mom""?","I (22M) have a best friend (23F) who recently came out as a trans woman. I'll call her Dee. We've been friends since I was in 2nd grade. Last month she asked me to meet her for lunch, she had smth important to tell me. I wasn't sure what it was and wondered if she’d found a man (up til now she’d identified as a gay man) or if smth happened in her family. But when I showed up and Dee was in a dress with a full face of make-up and the hair she’d been growing out was in a nice updo, I knew. I wouldn't say I was blindsided, there’d been signs. Things I’d brushed off as ""that's just Dee."" While I do understand that boys/men like feminine stuff, as I saw her sitting there all the puzzle pieces fell into place. We spent hours talking about how she realized, what she might change her name to, how her family and our other friends might take it, and everything that comes with transitioning. She was glowing. I am so happy for her, she seemed so much happier than I've ever seen her before. 

Here's where I might be the asshole. Last weekend my parents had me and my sisters over with some other family. My sisters and I were catching up and they asked how Dee was. Dee had given me permission to tell her news to my family so I shared that she’d come out. My sisters were happy for her and as we were discussing what this meant for her future, my dad walked by and heard what we were talking about. He was confused and asked who we were talking about so I explained. He scoffed. He said smth derogatory about trans people that I will not repeat and said he would never refer to her as a woman because ""he is a man and always will be.""

He’d never said anything trans/homophobic before and I was shocked and disgusted. My sisters laid into him as I found my words. I told him if he refused to refer to her correctly then I would show him how it felt by referring to him wrong. That he’d be ""mom"" until he came to his senses. I spent the rest of the night using she/her pronouns for him. My sisters joined and he hated it. He was pissed. Mom found out halfway through the night and chided us to stop but we told her what happened and while she didnt take our side, she didn't tell us to stop. The night ended with my sisters and I saying ""good night moms! We love you both!""
We've been keeping this up, and he's still pissed. I got a call from my grandma (dads mom) saying I'm being immature and I need to respect my father and drop this. When I explained what happened she said smth similar to what he said that night. She doesn't have anything over me, I'm fortunate enough to be able to support myself. My younger sister however is still in college and she's threatening to pull her contribution to tuition if we don't drop it.

2,1ccuf8s,UPDATE: AITA is told my husband to stop supporting his adult daughter,"
Hello everyone!

Ive shown this to my husband to open up his mind a little and he apologized. He said he needed time to think for days and came up with a solution. He’s cutting his daughter off. She just called to remind him about the weekly allowance and when he said we can’t afford right now she just started crying hysterically and told us how selfish we are. All this while knowing how we are now behind rent.

To those asking, yes she knows about the accident. She even knows now we are behind rent but still blames us as to why she wont be getting support anymore.

My husband used to say i have a patience of a saint and i just cracked now because it’s too much. We need to care for our own son too BUT since he’s still being supportive and everything is being taken care of in regards of our kid i didn’t feel the need to include him in the equation. He’s a good dad and that will never change.

I messaged his ex to know how much she’s charging her for rent so we could do half she was surprised because she’s not charging her anything and is frustrated because all she does is party every weekend. Apparently it’s not dental implants he paid for, it’s veneers and just cosmetic.

Thank you reddit! My husband and I are going to counseling but he apologized and that’s a big step.",UPDATE,2024-04-25,"UPDATE: AITA is told my husband to stop supporting his adult daughter

3,1ccineq,AITA for not letting my mom use my Netflix account?,"

So, I recently moved out of my parents' house to live on my own. I pay for my own Netflix account, and I love binge-watching shows in my free time. Now, my mom (48F) has been pestering me to give her my login details so she can watch her favorite shows too.

Here's the thing: my mom has always been kind of overbearing. She used to monitor my internet usage when I lived at home and would often comment on what I was watching or reading online. I felt like I had no privacy.

Now that I have my own place, I just want to enjoy my Netflix account without feeling like I'm being watched. But my mom is guilt-tripping me, saying I'm being selfish and that I owe her for all the years she raised me.

I feel torn because I love my mom, but I also want some boundaries. AITA for not letting her use my Netflix account?


EDIT: I forgot to mention that I don't have a job, and basically my mom gives me money each month to live. I showed her this thread to prove that she is the crazy one, she got really mad and has now cut me of from funding!!!!

EDIT2: OKAY so just to be clear: the reason I don't have  a job is because I am severely disabled and there is no economic support for people like me in my country.

8,1cchw6h,AITA for sharing a bed with my ex wife's sister?,"My (38M) ex wife (34F, Tara) and I have been divorced for almost 4 years but we have a good relationship. We are friends and basically never fight. Our daughter (7F) lives with Tara but I see her every weekend. I haven't been with any women in a serious way since the divorce because I don't want to make things more difficult. As far as I know Tara hasn't really been with any man but I don't ask.

Tara's sister (31F, Liz) recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been staying at her place. Liz has always been nice to me and we never had any issue. She seems to have a kinda messy personal life with weird boyfriends that come and go but I never had any reason to think of her as a bad person.

Tara took our daughter to a trip out of town last weekend so I was alone at my place saturday night when Liz called. She was alone at Tara's house and was scared because she heard strange noises from outside. She was afraid because she thought her ex boyfriend might be stalking her. I told her to call the police but she said they wouldn't do anything and asked me to go help her.

After I arrived, she calm down and we had dinner together. I realised she wasn't going to let me leave as she got visibly distressed any time I hinted at it so I suggested I could sleep on the couch. Liz told me Tara wouldn't like that because the couch was new and expensive. She also argued my daughter's bed was too small for me to use.

Liz said she had been sleeping on Tara's bed with her for weeks and it was big enough for the two of us to use comfortably.

Am I the Asshole?",Asshole,2024-04-25,"AITA for sharing a bed with my ex wife's sister? My (38M) ex wife (34F, Tara) and I have been divorced for almost 4 years but we have a good relationship. We are friends and basically never fight. Our daughter (7F) lives with Tara but I see her every weekend. I haven't been with any women in a serious way since the divorce because I don't want to make things more difficult. As far as I know Tara hasn't really been with any man but I don't ask.

Tara's sister (31F, Liz) recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been staying at her place. Liz has always been nice to me and we never had any issue. She seems to have a kinda messy personal life with weird boyfriends that come and go but I never had any reason to think of her as a bad person.

Tara took our daughter to a trip out of town last weekend so I was alone at my place saturday night when Liz called. She was alone at Tara's house and was scared because she heard strange noises from outside. She was afraid because she thought her ex boyfriend might be stalking her. I told her to call the police but she said they wouldn't do anything and asked me to go help her.

After I arrived, she calm down and we had dinner together. I realised she wasn't going to let me leave as she got visibly distressed any time I hinted at it so I suggested I could sleep on the couch. Liz told me Tara wouldn't like that because the couch was new and expensive. She also argued my daughter's bed was too small for me to use.

Liz said she had been sleeping on Tara's bed with her for weeks and it was big enough for the two of us to use comfortably.

18,1ccgbbg,AITA for not wanting to move to Alaska?,"My husband (31m) and I (29f) had our first child a few months ago. He works a decently paid construction job, and I work in a dental office. Unfortunately, my salary is not great. About half of my paycheck is going towards daycare, which is leading me to look into a possible evening/weekend job to avoid paying for childcare. My husband has also been applying to various other jobs in his field with no luck so far.
So about a week ago he tells me he found a job posting for a carpenter that he is qualified for. He says that the pay is so good that I could even be a stay-at-home mom if he got the job. The catch, of course, being we would have to move from the eastern U.S. to Alaska (he has not specified which area exactly). I immediately turned down the idea. Leaving my life, friends, and family behind to move thousands of miles away to a state I, frankly, know nothing about doesn’t seem appealing. 
However, he is much more serious about this than I thought. He won’t stop bringing it up. He’s convinced that this would solve all of our financial struggles. He has even looked up houses the area claiming they are much more affordable than houses in our area. I just cannot wrap my head around how he thinks this is a good idea. Sure the pay may be great, but what about the cost of living, or the cost of moving out there? Could we even handle adjusting to the climate in Alaska? And even if it’s true that I could be a stay-at-home mom, that is all I would be. I’d be leaving everyone else that I care about behind, and I know I would be miserable for that reason alone.
My husband has even gone as far as to say he could move out there by himself and send us money. At that point it wouldn’t even feel like a marriage to me. I told him that him leaving, or us moving that far away is not what I signed up for when I married him. His response was that I’ve always known he wanted to leave our state. Ok, but I assumed maybe he’d want to move a few states away, not Alaska! He says it’s no different, which just baffles me. I know I know next to nothing about life in Alaska or moving for a job. I just don’t believe that the grass is always greener, and that he’s too quick to think that such a drastic move will solve all of our problems.

He has even looked up houses the area claiming they are much more affordable than houses in our area. I just cannot wrap my head around how he thinks this is a good idea. Sure the pay may be great, but what about the cost of living, or the cost of moving out there? Could we even handle adjusting to the climate in Alaska? And even if it’s true that I could be a stay-at-home mom, that is all I would be. I’d be leaving everyone else that I care about behind, and I know I would be miserable for that reason alone.
My husband has even gone as far as to say he could move out there by himself and send us money. At that point it wouldn’t even feel like a marriage to me. I told him that him leaving, or us moving that far away is not what I signed up for when I married him. His response was that I’ve always known he wanted to leave our state. Ok, but I assumed maybe he’d want to move a few states away, not Alaska! He says it’s no different, which just baffles me. I know I know next to nothing about life in Alaska or moving for a job. I just don’t believe that the grass is always greener, and that he’s too quick to think that such a drastic move will solve all of our problems. Yet he almost seems resentful that I’m not seeing it his way. AITA for not considering moving to Alaska as an option for our family? ",0.0,0.03231939,0,1
19,1ccgasf,AITA for snitching on my bestfriend to his brother?,"Me (23M) and my bestfriend (23M) just had our biggest fight today. My bestfriend always ends up in money problems and keeps borrowing money from me or others. He always gives the money back but never on time, from days to weeks to even months. 

A bit backstory here, he recently had a debt of 25k dollars and I helped him borrow the money from a third friend. After a few months of him struggling to give back, we all decided that it was best to involve his big brother. We ended up asking for 30k from his brother as he wanted 5k for himself. 

Now he borrowed 1,5k dollars from me and was supposed to give it back 4 days ago. He is the type of person to beg for money, but acts like a douchbag right after he has got the money just cuz he thinks it’s funny. I urgently needed half of it and he said he would give me half today and the rest when the week ends. 

Today he started saying that he would give me half of the money next month as a joke. I got irritated and told him that I would tell his big brother if I did not receive half of the money today. After only receiving 400 dollars. I told him that I would tell his brother to press him. He told me that was fine and that I would make the situation easier, because then I get the 1,5k and he can keep the 1,5k he was supposed to give back. I asked him multiple times if it was okay and he said yes. 
So I went and told his big brother as this was not the first time going to his brother because of his money problems and cuz he legit told me to ask his brother.

20,1ccg5k7,AITA for wanting to move out on my own when my partner is strongly against it?,"I’m 21 and my and my boyfriend (Jake) have been together for 5 years. My mum and I had lots of conflicts and so after a big one when I was 18 I started staying with Jake and his parents.

Jake works a really good job atm and is studying and is not going to move out until his uni degree is done (at least 3 more years). His parents are letting us live there rent free for us to save for a house.

I go in between my mums house and his parents (staying more at his parents) because of my job being only 9 mins away from mum so I stay with her between shifts and then go back to his on my off days. 

I’ve always felt like quite an outsider within his family and recently it’s just becoming worse and worse for me. When Jake’s brother and sister IL come over for dinner, I get so much anxiety because I can go whole dinners without saying a word because him, his brother and his dad talk about things I have no idea about like cars and tools, and his sis IL and mum work in the same place so they only discuss work and gossip about people they know. 

For context, his bro and sis IL are both older than us but still in their mid to late 20s. 

Jake says I can just be on my phone like he does sometimes, but I get frustrated because I’m trying to be present and polite, and there’s less pressure for him around his own immediate family for him to not care if he’s on his phone or not/being social. 

Recently I’ve said that I want to move out and pay rent on my own to try and see if it improves things. 

I am part time at the moment (earning at least 1500/1700 per fortnight, not taking into account if it’s over a public holiday or if I pick up over time.)

 The rentals I’m looking at are around $350 per week and then I’d have to pay bills/food. I could also modify my roster now and try to a day or change to full time if needed (earning then at least $2300 a fortnight excluding penalties) 

Jake is strongly against saying it would be a silly financial decision and I have a really good opportunity to set myself up. I mentioned i acknowledge I would be financially difficult but potentially great for my mental state, and he said I could just work through my mental problems other ways. 
I talk to psychologists and they still haven’t made this feeling go away so it’s not like I haven’t tried to make this work. 
I don’t tell my mum anything about my anxiety because she usually makes me regret breaking down by telling me that I’m upsetting her for being so upset. 

The reason I mention this is because my mum is saying that renting is “dead throw away money” and that I should just wait longer and keep living with his parents because it’s such a good opportunity. And she said that it does sound good to go out and live on your own and be independent but I should save and wait and buy a really good house instead. She also said that if I do this, I would lose Jake, no doubt about it.

When he told me the news of the newborn I was not prepared for his next statement. He said “I’m gonna have to go bring my cousin to stay with us so we can care for her because her mother is not gonna be able to care for her anymore because she has a newborn”. I said huh?

This is the vehicle my husband usually drives to work since his F150 died. My mom decided to move across the state to be closer to my sister and her grandkids (my sister's kids). I recently took on more hours and responsibilities at work, when my sister told me my mom got an offer on her home (after she took it off the market and decided not to move) and then after weeks of searching my mom finally has an accepted home purchase offer. I'm happy she's moving,  but suddenly my sister is offering for both of us to take PTO from work to help her move and for me to drive a large storage pod with my truck. I've told my sister I'm not comfortable hauling anything large for that distance with my old truck but would come out and would haul a small-medium trailer. I also pointed out my work responsibilities changed and I have too many meetings to take off work a day every week (I'm a project manager with a big project launch coming up, my first big project). For reference my sister also has a big truck that is as old as mine but has a newer engine and her family owns 4 total vehicles so if her truck gets damage or wear, she's got others. I do not. I also work two jobs to keep up on bills so I cant afford to lose hours. 
She wants our mom back closer to her children (grandkids) and I don't blame her, but she's really pushed my mom to move. She took charge of the house search and now is taking initiative on the move.  My mom hasn't asked me to help at all, but I recently reached out to my mom and told her I'm willing to help when I can but I'm not comfortable hauling anything large or overloaded and that I'm booked out with work until mid June. I feel like an a-hole after talking to my mom about my limitations,  but I've gotten nearly all information about her moving second hand from my sister who she sees and talks to more than me since my sister has cute grandkids for her and I do not so when my mom makes the drive to the area we live in, she doesn't stop to visit me since she has limited time and wants to spend more with the little kids. 
As an added bonus, one of my sister's older children accidentally broke my hand and it's still not 100% healed so that's another limitation I'm currently dealing with and still in physical therapy.

For reference my sister also has a big truck that is as old as mine but has a newer engine and her family owns 4 total vehicles so if her truck gets damage or wear, she's got others. I do not. I also work two jobs to keep up on bills so I cant afford to lose hours. 
She wants our mom back closer to her children (grandkids) and I don't blame her, but she's really pushed my mom to move. She took charge of the house search and now is taking initiative on the move.  My mom hasn't asked me to help at all, but I recently reached out to my mom and told her I'm willing to help when I can but I'm not comfortable hauling anything large or overloaded and that I'm booked out with work until mid June. I feel like an a-hole after talking to my mom about my limitations,  but I've gotten nearly all information about her moving second hand from my sister who she sees and talks to more than me since my sister has cute grandkids for her and I do not so when my mom makes the drive to the area we live in, she doesn't stop to visit me since she has limited time and wants to spend more with the little kids. 
As an added bonus, one of my sister's older children accidentally broke my hand and it's still not 100% healed so that's another limitation I'm currently dealing with and still in physical therapy. 
So, AITA?

26,1ccfp6i,AITA For Keeping My WiFi To Myself?,"Hello. So my father has been staying with me for several months now and it's not been easy on me at all. To start, he has had unstable employment for years now and I've had to do a lot for him. This includes when I had to pay his rent for the room he stayed in (before getting my apartment, I lived in a couple's room for rent. When they found out he was homeless, they told him he could move into my room. I agreed as I didn't want to see my dad homeless, thhough I was upset since it ruined my newfound privacy and our relationship is shaky to begin with due to his drinking issue.)

When a woman in the room downstairs moved out, I paid for him to move into into it so I could have my space back. I managed to move out and into my 1st apartment which is a very small 1 bdr. However, my dad lost his job again and I had to balance paying my own rent while paying his. He began getting unemployment but that fell through, and instead of having me pay his rent he decided to just bring all his things to my place & crash here. 

It took him a while to find another job. He has a habit of joining temp agencies that are notorious for randomly firing workers & other issues. I've tried again & again to help him with finding employment (buying him interview clothes, managing his emails & filling out applications, researching jobs in the area, practically everything. And it's been *exhausting*. I'm often moody at home because I still have rent and bills to pay on top of everything I do for him, & he often guilts me by complaining about my attitude but I can't help how I feel. I can't roam free in my apartment because he occupies the entire living room, we argue bc he uses up things like my food & tp & he doesn't seem grateful at all. My bills have run up double despite me being home not even half the time, & although he just recently started working again he hasn't given me enough $ to cover all that he's costing me.

So, that brings about my current issue. I just recently installed WiFi. My job is okay but as of late, overtime is heavily restricted so I'm not able to make as much $ as I need. I figured w/ WiFi I can cut back on my phone bill & try to find ways to get a second job from home. The WiFi came with a generic name & password, which I changed as prompted by the app. My dad woke up from his nap & asked if I changed the password. I told him that I changed both. He told me I need to send him the network name & the password. I said that I got the plan with limited amount of devices and that the WiFi is for me (I specified this in my conversation with him yesterday). He got upset & said I ruined his day & when I gave him my explanation again he called it BS. I don't feel like arguing and feel bad, but at the same time he's always guilt tripping me. Rarely anything in my apartment is just for me despite me paying the rent and bills and everything else, but I'm doubting myself here.

28,1ccfftx,AITA for being mad at my bestie,"I’ve talked about her before and I just wanted to let it all out. I enjoy being around her, but I don’t have anybody else in school that I’m really really friends with. She’s the only real friend I have but sometimes she gets out of hand

Whenever I make stuff in class, she copies me a lot. Today in class we were doing slideshow projects and I had an idea and she had hers but then she looked at my idea and then changed her original one to mine. Also last time we did presentations I picked a black theme for mine and she had to pick a black theme too but I’d like to think that was just a coincidence. 

I used to think it was just temporary and I just have a bit of anger issues but it’s a bit serious. My favourite number is 7 because of a whole lot of reasons, 1. My last name starts with D so my number in class is always 7 or 6. 2. When I was little I fell off a bicycle 7th times and on the 7th attempt I fell and got a huge bruise. Real stories.

So one day I was bored in math class so I asked for her favourite number and I would put hers and mine together and calculate the average for a cute little friendship number. Im a nerd I know. And she said 7…. I honestly tried thinking that a lot of people in the world have 7 as their lucky number but also I have a big sister who’s fav number is 16 cause her birthday is literally on the 16 and I would say my fav number is 16 when I was little cause I wanted to be like her. Then my best friend had to have the fav number 16.

Also I feel like she’s starting to dress like me, like the things I would wear a lot she would. Oversized Sweaters, black jackets specifically, black boots or white sneakers. I would think it’s common because a lot of people wear like that but it’s starting to get a bit odd because she also cut her hair short when she grew her hair really long since she was a baby because I got really short hair. She even said to me that she wanted the same length as mine.

On top of that, the ways I sit and talk are a bit replicated from her. I’ve once ranted about this before and they just responded with, “she’s probably just looking up to you” or “maybe she’s tying to find things that will suit her” but I feel like like she’s flat out trying to replicate me

It even got to the point sometimes people confused our names but I feel guilty saying this but her personality is a bit weird. When we hangout she doesn’t even talk unless I talk even though we’ve been friends for 5 years. Whenever I ask her something, she says “whatever” or “you can pick” to the point it gets annoying because every choice is supposed to be mine to make.

I’m a bit scared of dogs and I would laugh about my fear and she would laugh back or joke once and that’ll be fine right? That’s what you would think but she instead every time I see a dog she goes like “Are u scared??” And laughs like she’s trying to lock me but at the same time I don’t think she’s trying to and it just crosses the line every single time.

30,1ccf4hg,AITA for going out with my boyfriend instead of my coworkers? ,"So it was my (24 f) and my boyfriends (26 m) anniversary a couple days ago. Due to us both working that day, we couldn't celebrate until today. I let him pick the place we went to go out to eat, and he happened to choose a place that myself and my coworkers made plans to go to at some point in the near future. There was no official day planned out for us to all go, but we all like this place and knew we wanted to go together. 

Something funny happened while we were there, and I texted the groupchat I have with said coworkers to let them know about it. They both took offense to the fact that I was there without them. I tried explaining that it was for our 5 year anniversary, I wasnt even the one that picked the place, *and* that we made no official plans to go on a specific day. It was more of just a ""what if"" kind of plan. I thought they were joking at first so i kind of laughed it off, but they both said they were mad.

I can kind of understand why they'd be slightly upset, as at no point before this conversation took place did i tell them it was our anniversary and i didn't ever mention it's a place my boyfriend and I frequent a couple times a month. But they both surpassed slightly upset, and were outright *very* angry at me for going without them. Their explanation was simply that we always hype up how fun it would be for us to go together, and they think it's unfair I go without them after getting them both excited. I think they're both wildly overreacting, but I could be wrong. 

Now they won't answer my texts. I work with both of them tomorrow and I'm worried they're actually very upset with me. I don't know if I gave then the wrong impression or what, but if I did something truly wrong, I'd like to know so I can apologize and try to make it up to them.

I do feel kind of dumb even making this post because it seems like such a non issue, but I care about them both so much that I don't want them to be angry with me for any reason especially something as simple as this.

And I just hated how pathetic she stood there, waving her body around because she doesn’t know what to do. I don’t think she means any bad but it really got on my nerves because she is my best friend and she should tell them to move their ass off her desk.

34,1cceyl3,AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months ,"I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up. 

Whenever I asked for an apology about her not taking me seriously she would say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"" and got angry with me for refusing to accept an apology like that. 

I continued to treat her normally after this until November when I was volunteering at her work. I catered an event for her. When we got home, my brother started playing fighting with me and I kicked him back (gently as I do sparring and didn't want to hurt him) when Mom saw, she started screaming at me. I'm fairly certain she was just taking the stress of the day out on me. 

I asked her for a bit of space and started to stay in my room more. She kept coming in my room and refusing to leave me alone. I stopped responding to her and speaking to her and this went on for two months. At the end of the second month, she told me that if I didn't start talking to her again she would take my car and make me quit my job and all of the classes I take outside of school (judo, welding, etc). She also started to accuse me of stuff I've never done. She started trying to diagnose me with stuff and apparently told my grandma. I had to start talking to her because I was scared of what she would do if I didn't. Her therapist said she was doing the right thing and had every right to threaten me as she is my parent.

So AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-25,"AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months  I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up.

35,1ccew8q,AITA if I don’t go see a “Friend’s” ailing family member?,"So, there is a person I’ve known for a really long time (since school, about 16-17 years) I never really liked her because of all the negative things she would say and the way she would behave towards everyone but somehow she made her way into our friend group and it’s like we’re obligated to invite her to everything or else she cause unnecessary drama that none of us want. She makes so many out of line comments that I can never forget, when I stepped on her foot once accidentally she said “what the hell, do you know how much you weigh”. There’s a lot more she’s done and said till date. I’ve been just ignoring and just going a long with it but just very recently she said some nasty things to our friend which was not only out of line but she showed her very narrow minded outlook on life, since that day there’s some switch that went off in my head and I just cannot get myself to even exchange a hi or hello over text let alone meet her.
Recently one of her family member has been sick and getting treatment, everyone is paying a visit to see how they are doing. I respectfully decided to not go however, I am always willing to help in any ways shape or form from afar. 
Note: even the family member has said, done things that have been pretty negative and even at one point my mom told me to cut off ties this was back in school but because I was young and that was first time in my life where I had a stable friendship group going that we were a part of, I thought she’s just one person I can handle it but anyways, it’s been way to long to have people like that in my life. I am 33 now and I just cannot get myself to be okay with people that disrespect me.

36,1cceipk,AITA for leaving my friends house early because of how bad it is?,"I (18M) recently visited my friends (18M) house to sleep over for a few nights and while I did initially have a good time hanging out with him I'm leaving a day early because of how asinine being here has been and how unlivable it feels. When I got here they guided me up to the third floor where I would be staying in their guest room. It is a pretty small room with a bunch of clutter on one side of the room and a twin bed. The issue arises with that the lamp is so low and dangly in the room that I keep hitting my head on it. Along with that the door opens up directly to the stairs that go to the 2nd floor and are placed awkwardly so that there's no floor outside of the door so the door to the room im in is just on the side of these stairs meaning if you weren't looking while leaving the room you would miss your step and tumble sideways down the stairs. 

The other issue is that much of the house seems not fully built. For example, the floor in my room is this weird rough plywood material and all the stairs have exposed insulation coming out of it and this weird glue substance. Also, the only bathroom is on the first floor and there are no lights in the bathroom and no sink either just a toilet and shower. The house is filled with clutter and trinkets and knick-knacks and everything about it screams hoarder and I can handle a messy house but this truly somehow got to a limit I was shocked existed. Also on the stairs going from the 2nd to first floor there is a stair cover that is made out of a cheap plastic material that you have to lift up and is screwed into the wall with 2 hinges. 

The bed in the room I'm staying in is also horribly uncomfortable and feels like its filled with hay and scraps of paper. All of this has been affecting my sleep since to go to the bathroom at night they don't allow me to turn on lights so I have to use my phone flashlight and carefully exit my room without tumbling down the stairs before lifting up a plastic stair cover and then finally going to the bathroom with no sink. Then go all the way back up and sleep in the most uncomfortable bed ever.I really have tried to be a good guest but after a couple days of this I told him I'm leaving early and he got upset and said that wasn't what we planned on. I told him in the nicest way I could that I couldn't get adequate sleep but he didn't seem to care and said he's slept on the guest bed before and its fine and I am spoiled and expect to much of him. 

I feel bad and maybe I'm being picky and spoiled but I just cant handle the lunacy of his house.

37,1ccds4p,AITA for calling the sheriff on my neighbors for blocking me in,"So, i (23f) live in a neighborhood where the parking is street parking aka public parking. i grew up never dealing with that, it just wasn’t a thing where i’m from. 

so, when my neighbors started complaining (a year ago) for parking in certain places i was really confused. the car would be moved routinely and at the time when the complaints started i worked nights. my neighborhood is a bit sketch and i would just park wherever was available and closest to home. i would sometimes park beside our driveway / in front of our neighbors house which consisted of being in front of both of our mailboxes. 

i ended up getting a ticket specifically for blocking their mailbox which i’m pretty sure they called in. they’ve left a note on my car saying “are you not embarrassed, do you not understand, don’t know how to respect not to park here”. they’ve come out to ask me while i’m in my car to move so they can put trash can bins out on days that weren’t pick up dates. these neighbors don’t use the space. they just want to save the space to have it empty, they used to put out their bins and would leave them their for days till someone else in our neighborhood called it in.

yesterday, i parked where i always do but this time i parked in front of the mailboxes so i was a bit in the middle of the available area rather than the edge to avoid possible ticket. my neighbors ended up blocking me in. they parked both their cars like a cm away from both ends of me. i initially called to get them towed but they said they needed to be issued a ticket first which would give them 24 hrs to move & to call 911. which i called the sheriffs number bc it was what i was given to me. he ended up not issuing a ticket & instead talked to us both separately. i feel a bit stupid, i honestly regret my decision but in the moment it felt reasonable lol. i feel like a bit of an asshole for having a bit too extreme. thoughts?

ps. i just wanted them to be issued a ticket just like they issued me one, i thought it would be anonymous!!!

edit: i didn’t mean that i parked in front of the mailboxes again, i parked in front of them leaving the mailbox space free 

edit: y’all i did NOT park in front of their mailbox again. i parked ahead (?) of it meaning i left that space free for the mail man. however, when they blocked me in it meant that THEY parked in front of MY mailbox bc our mailboxes are right beside each other.

38,1ccdpxe,AITA for ditching a friend at the airport in Mexico?,"I take frequent trips to Mexico for vacation. Last couple trips down there have been solo. I've been trying to get friends or family to join me but the timing never lines up. I've stayed in contact over the years with a buddy from my hometown that I went to middle school with. On one of our recent conversations he mentioned he had just got back from a trip to Peru and really enjoyed it. I figured he's familiar with traveling internationally and he's always been a good guy whenever I return to my hometown for visits, why not invite him to meet me in Mexico? He had never been there before and I thought it would be fun to show him around and have a travel buddy on this trip.

He agrees and we arrange a time and place to meet around the airport in the Mexican town we're traveling to. The day of our flights my flight is delayed by two hours. Getting through immigration takes FOREVER. My buddy arrived about 4 hours before I did and spent that time drinking at the airport bar. When I finally catch up with him, he's completely wasted. He begins accusing the bar staff of stealing his money. He's making really inappropriate comments to other tourists about how hot their wives/girlfriends are. I inform him I'm contacting the Uber and we need to meet him on the street outside the airport as Ubers aren't allowed on airport property. Arrival time for the Uber is 6 minutes, exactly enough time to make it to the street. My friend begins chasing women around the airport trying to get their phone numbers. I finally get him outside and close to the street. He spots a small group of female airport employees on their break on the side of the airport. He begins harassing  them and trying to get their phone numbers. He's not taking ""NO""  for an answer.

When they try to walk away from him, he grabs one of them by the arm and refuses to let go until she gives him her phone number. I plead with him to leave her alone and apologize like crazy to her. I get the notification that the Uber has arrived. I don't want to end up in a Mexican jail so I tell him we have to leave now! He refuses and says he'll kill me (jokingly...I'm pretty sure) if I interrupt his ""conversation"" with this airport employee. I informed him that I'm leaving right now with or without him. He ignores me. So I hop in the Uber and leave him stranded at the airport. I started receiving texts and calls from his friends and family about not hearing from him.
