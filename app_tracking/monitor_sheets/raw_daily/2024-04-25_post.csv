0,1ccvgeh,"AITA for telling my daughter that ""alienation"" is not a good enough reason to change schools?","I'm (38F) going to be as straightforward as possible. My daughter (16F) started high school last September. She's an incredibly smart kid and got into the best high school in our city (and best nationwide ranked by admission grade; for reference her class had 26 spots up for grab & the lowest admission grade was 9.89 / 10). We were so proud of her. Now, this school also has a reputation as a hub for wealthy kids. We're solid middle class. We didn't think this would matter that much, since rich kids are still just kids at the end of the day and she should try being friends with everyone. She's quite a shy and quiet person. Even though she was nervous about the whole thing (to be expected), she also looked excited until high school actually began.

Immediately after the first day, she started complaining. She said the teachers are amazing, facilities are good, but her classmates... not the best experience to say the least. Apparently they're all from very rich families, and her and her benchmate are the only ""poor"" students in that class. She said they're not mean and don't bully anyone, and if she asks them about school related things they always respond nicely / willing to help; but they're extremely cliquey and essentially ignore her and her benchmate - it's as if they're invisible. She said she tried to talk with them a few times but they respond in a friendly but blunt matter, which doesn't leave room for conversation. She said academically they're extremely strong, but she feels the teachers are biased towards them 'cause they get private lessons by them (especially at math, physics and computer science). I considered getting her into these tutoring lessons as well, but the hourly rate these teachers charge is just too high for us. My husband and I made efforts to send her on 2 school trips so far (skiing in February and weekend sighting in December) and she said she was ignored the whole time. Basically she feels like a pariah, and said she sometimes goes into the bathroom and cries during breaks as she's lonely the entire day (she doesn't have a good relationship with her benchmate). 

Recently she came up to my husband and I and told us that she wanted to transfer to another school for 10th grade. We listed to what she had to say but told her no, because there's no serious reason for that. She's not bullied, the school has great prestige, the academics and teachers are great, etc. Just because people are distant doesn't mean it's enough for her to move. School is like a job, you go there to work and return home; making friends is not a requirement. She was very angry at us and said that we're deliberately obtuse and don't care about her mental health. I personally think she's just childish.

1,1ccuncv,"AITA for calling my dad ""mom""?","I (22M) have a best friend (23F) who recently came out as a trans woman. I'll call her Dee. We've been friends since I was in 2nd grade. Last month she asked me to meet her for lunch, she had smth important to tell me. I wasn't sure what it was and wondered if she’d found a man (up til now she’d identified as a gay man) or if smth happened in her family. But when I showed up and Dee was in a dress with a full face of make-up and the hair she’d been growing out was in a nice updo, I knew. I wouldn't say I was blindsided, there’d been signs. Things I’d brushed off as ""that's just Dee."" While I do understand that boys/men like feminine stuff, as I saw her sitting there all the puzzle pieces fell into place. We spent hours talking about how she realized, what she might change her name to, how her family and our other friends might take it, and everything that comes with transitioning. She was glowing. I am so happy for her, she seemed so much happier than I've ever seen her before. 

Here's where I might be the asshole. Last weekend my parents had me and my sisters over with some other family. My sisters and I were catching up and they asked how Dee was. Dee had given me permission to tell her news to my family so I shared that she’d come out. My sisters were happy for her and as we were discussing what this meant for her future, my dad walked by and heard what we were talking about. He was confused and asked who we were talking about so I explained. He scoffed. He said smth derogatory about trans people that I will not repeat and said he would never refer to her as a woman because ""he is a man and always will be.""

He’d never said anything trans/homophobic before and I was shocked and disgusted. My sisters laid into him as I found my words. I told him if he refused to refer to her correctly then I would show him how it felt by referring to him wrong. That he’d be ""mom"" until he came to his senses. I spent the rest of the night using she/her pronouns for him. My sisters joined and he hated it. He was pissed. Mom found out halfway through the night and chided us to stop but we told her what happened and while she didnt take our side, she didn't tell us to stop. The night ended with my sisters and I saying ""good night moms! We love you both!""
We've been keeping this up, and he's still pissed. I got a call from my grandma (dads mom) saying I'm being immature and I need to respect my father and drop this. When I explained what happened she said smth similar to what he said that night. She doesn't have anything over me, I'm fortunate enough to be able to support myself. My younger sister however is still in college and she's threatening to pull her contribution to tuition if we don't drop it.

2,1ccuf8s,UPDATE: AITA is told my husband to stop supporting his adult daughter,"
Hello everyone!

Ive shown this to my husband to open up his mind a little and he apologized. He said he needed time to think for days and came up with a solution. He’s cutting his daughter off. She just called to remind him about the weekly allowance and when he said we can’t afford right now she just started crying hysterically and told us how selfish we are. All this while knowing how we are now behind rent.

To those asking, yes she knows about the accident. She even knows now we are behind rent but still blames us as to why she wont be getting support anymore.

My husband used to say i have a patience of a saint and i just cracked now because it’s too much. We need to care for our own son too BUT since he’s still being supportive and everything is being taken care of in regards of our kid i didn’t feel the need to include him in the equation. He’s a good dad and that will never change.

I messaged his ex to know how much she’s charging her for rent so we could do half she was surprised because she’s not charging her anything and is frustrated because all she does is party every weekend. Apparently it’s not dental implants he paid for, it’s veneers and just cosmetic.

Thank you reddit! My husband and I are going to counseling but he apologized and that’s a big step.",UPDATE,2024-04-25,"UPDATE: AITA is told my husband to stop supporting his adult daughter

3,1ccineq,AITA for not letting my mom use my Netflix account?,"

So, I recently moved out of my parents' house to live on my own. I pay for my own Netflix account, and I love binge-watching shows in my free time. Now, my mom (48F) has been pestering me to give her my login details so she can watch her favorite shows too.

Here's the thing: my mom has always been kind of overbearing. She used to monitor my internet usage when I lived at home and would often comment on what I was watching or reading online. I felt like I had no privacy.

Now that I have my own place, I just want to enjoy my Netflix account without feeling like I'm being watched. But my mom is guilt-tripping me, saying I'm being selfish and that I owe her for all the years she raised me.

I feel torn because I love my mom, but I also want some boundaries. AITA for not letting her use my Netflix account?


EDIT: I forgot to mention that I don't have a job, and basically my mom gives me money each month to live. I showed her this thread to prove that she is the crazy one, she got really mad and has now cut me of from funding!!!!

EDIT2: OKAY so just to be clear: the reason I don't have  a job is because I am severely disabled and there is no economic support for people like me in my country.

8,1cchw6h,AITA for sharing a bed with my ex wife's sister?,"My (38M) ex wife (34F, Tara) and I have been divorced for almost 4 years but we have a good relationship. We are friends and basically never fight. Our daughter (7F) lives with Tara but I see her every weekend. I haven't been with any women in a serious way since the divorce because I don't want to make things more difficult. As far as I know Tara hasn't really been with any man but I don't ask.

Tara's sister (31F, Liz) recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been staying at her place. Liz has always been nice to me and we never had any issue. She seems to have a kinda messy personal life with weird boyfriends that come and go but I never had any reason to think of her as a bad person.

Tara took our daughter to a trip out of town last weekend so I was alone at my place saturday night when Liz called. She was alone at Tara's house and was scared because she heard strange noises from outside. She was afraid because she thought her ex boyfriend might be stalking her. I told her to call the police but she said they wouldn't do anything and asked me to go help her.

After I arrived, she calm down and we had dinner together. I realised she wasn't going to let me leave as she got visibly distressed any time I hinted at it so I suggested I could sleep on the couch. Liz told me Tara wouldn't like that because the couch was new and expensive. She also argued my daughter's bed was too small for me to use.

Liz said she had been sleeping on Tara's bed with her for weeks and it was big enough for the two of us to use comfortably.

Am I the Asshole?",Asshole,2024-04-25,"AITA for sharing a bed with my ex wife's sister? My (38M) ex wife (34F, Tara) and I have been divorced for almost 4 years but we have a good relationship. We are friends and basically never fight. Our daughter (7F) lives with Tara but I see her every weekend. I haven't been with any women in a serious way since the divorce because I don't want to make things more difficult. As far as I know Tara hasn't really been with any man but I don't ask.

Tara's sister (31F, Liz) recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been staying at her place. Liz has always been nice to me and we never had any issue. She seems to have a kinda messy personal life with weird boyfriends that come and go but I never had any reason to think of her as a bad person.

Tara took our daughter to a trip out of town last weekend so I was alone at my place saturday night when Liz called. She was alone at Tara's house and was scared because she heard strange noises from outside. She was afraid because she thought her ex boyfriend might be stalking her. I told her to call the police but she said they wouldn't do anything and asked me to go help her.

After I arrived, she calm down and we had dinner together. I realised she wasn't going to let me leave as she got visibly distressed any time I hinted at it so I suggested I could sleep on the couch. Liz told me Tara wouldn't like that because the couch was new and expensive. She also argued my daughter's bed was too small for me to use.

Liz said she had been sleeping on Tara's bed with her for weeks and it was big enough for the two of us to use comfortably.

18,1ccgbbg,AITA for not wanting to move to Alaska?,"My husband (31m) and I (29f) had our first child a few months ago. He works a decently paid construction job, and I work in a dental office. Unfortunately, my salary is not great. About half of my paycheck is going towards daycare, which is leading me to look into a possible evening/weekend job to avoid paying for childcare. My husband has also been applying to various other jobs in his field with no luck so far.
So about a week ago he tells me he found a job posting for a carpenter that he is qualified for. He says that the pay is so good that I could even be a stay-at-home mom if he got the job. The catch, of course, being we would have to move from the eastern U.S. to Alaska (he has not specified which area exactly). I immediately turned down the idea. Leaving my life, friends, and family behind to move thousands of miles away to a state I, frankly, know nothing about doesn’t seem appealing. 
However, he is much more serious about this than I thought. He won’t stop bringing it up. He’s convinced that this would solve all of our financial struggles. He has even looked up houses the area claiming they are much more affordable than houses in our area. I just cannot wrap my head around how he thinks this is a good idea. Sure the pay may be great, but what about the cost of living, or the cost of moving out there? Could we even handle adjusting to the climate in Alaska? And even if it’s true that I could be a stay-at-home mom, that is all I would be. I’d be leaving everyone else that I care about behind, and I know I would be miserable for that reason alone.
My husband has even gone as far as to say he could move out there by himself and send us money. At that point it wouldn’t even feel like a marriage to me. I told him that him leaving, or us moving that far away is not what I signed up for when I married him. His response was that I’ve always known he wanted to leave our state. Ok, but I assumed maybe he’d want to move a few states away, not Alaska! He says it’s no different, which just baffles me. I know I know next to nothing about life in Alaska or moving for a job. I just don’t believe that the grass is always greener, and that he’s too quick to think that such a drastic move will solve all of our problems.

He has even looked up houses the area claiming they are much more affordable than houses in our area. I just cannot wrap my head around how he thinks this is a good idea. Sure the pay may be great, but what about the cost of living, or the cost of moving out there? Could we even handle adjusting to the climate in Alaska? And even if it’s true that I could be a stay-at-home mom, that is all I would be. I’d be leaving everyone else that I care about behind, and I know I would be miserable for that reason alone.
My husband has even gone as far as to say he could move out there by himself and send us money. At that point it wouldn’t even feel like a marriage to me. I told him that him leaving, or us moving that far away is not what I signed up for when I married him. His response was that I’ve always known he wanted to leave our state. Ok, but I assumed maybe he’d want to move a few states away, not Alaska! He says it’s no different, which just baffles me. I know I know next to nothing about life in Alaska or moving for a job. I just don’t believe that the grass is always greener, and that he’s too quick to think that such a drastic move will solve all of our problems. Yet he almost seems resentful that I’m not seeing it his way. AITA for not considering moving to Alaska as an option for our family? ",0.0,0.03231939,0,1
19,1ccgasf,AITA for snitching on my bestfriend to his brother?,"Me (23M) and my bestfriend (23M) just had our biggest fight today. My bestfriend always ends up in money problems and keeps borrowing money from me or others. He always gives the money back but never on time, from days to weeks to even months. 

A bit backstory here, he recently had a debt of 25k dollars and I helped him borrow the money from a third friend. After a few months of him struggling to give back, we all decided that it was best to involve his big brother. We ended up asking for 30k from his brother as he wanted 5k for himself. 

Now he borrowed 1,5k dollars from me and was supposed to give it back 4 days ago. He is the type of person to beg for money, but acts like a douchbag right after he has got the money just cuz he thinks it’s funny. I urgently needed half of it and he said he would give me half today and the rest when the week ends. 

Today he started saying that he would give me half of the money next month as a joke. I got irritated and told him that I would tell his big brother if I did not receive half of the money today. After only receiving 400 dollars. I told him that I would tell his brother to press him. He told me that was fine and that I would make the situation easier, because then I get the 1,5k and he can keep the 1,5k he was supposed to give back. I asked him multiple times if it was okay and he said yes. 
So I went and told his big brother as this was not the first time going to his brother because of his money problems and cuz he legit told me to ask his brother.

20,1ccg5k7,AITA for wanting to move out on my own when my partner is strongly against it?,"I’m 21 and my and my boyfriend (Jake) have been together for 5 years. My mum and I had lots of conflicts and so after a big one when I was 18 I started staying with Jake and his parents.

Jake works a really good job atm and is studying and is not going to move out until his uni degree is done (at least 3 more years). His parents are letting us live there rent free for us to save for a house.

I go in between my mums house and his parents (staying more at his parents) because of my job being only 9 mins away from mum so I stay with her between shifts and then go back to his on my off days. 

I’ve always felt like quite an outsider within his family and recently it’s just becoming worse and worse for me. When Jake’s brother and sister IL come over for dinner, I get so much anxiety because I can go whole dinners without saying a word because him, his brother and his dad talk about things I have no idea about like cars and tools, and his sis IL and mum work in the same place so they only discuss work and gossip about people they know. 

For context, his bro and sis IL are both older than us but still in their mid to late 20s. 

Jake says I can just be on my phone like he does sometimes, but I get frustrated because I’m trying to be present and polite, and there’s less pressure for him around his own immediate family for him to not care if he’s on his phone or not/being social. 

Recently I’ve said that I want to move out and pay rent on my own to try and see if it improves things. 

I am part time at the moment (earning at least 1500/1700 per fortnight, not taking into account if it’s over a public holiday or if I pick up over time.)

 The rentals I’m looking at are around $350 per week and then I’d have to pay bills/food. I could also modify my roster now and try to a day or change to full time if needed (earning then at least $2300 a fortnight excluding penalties) 

Jake is strongly against saying it would be a silly financial decision and I have a really good opportunity to set myself up. I mentioned i acknowledge I would be financially difficult but potentially great for my mental state, and he said I could just work through my mental problems other ways. 
I talk to psychologists and they still haven’t made this feeling go away so it’s not like I haven’t tried to make this work. 
I don’t tell my mum anything about my anxiety because she usually makes me regret breaking down by telling me that I’m upsetting her for being so upset. 

The reason I mention this is because my mum is saying that renting is “dead throw away money” and that I should just wait longer and keep living with his parents because it’s such a good opportunity. And she said that it does sound good to go out and live on your own and be independent but I should save and wait and buy a really good house instead. She also said that if I do this, I would lose Jake, no doubt about it.

When he told me the news of the newborn I was not prepared for his next statement. He said “I’m gonna have to go bring my cousin to stay with us so we can care for her because her mother is not gonna be able to care for her anymore because she has a newborn”. I said huh?

This is the vehicle my husband usually drives to work since his F150 died. My mom decided to move across the state to be closer to my sister and her grandkids (my sister's kids). I recently took on more hours and responsibilities at work, when my sister told me my mom got an offer on her home (after she took it off the market and decided not to move) and then after weeks of searching my mom finally has an accepted home purchase offer. I'm happy she's moving,  but suddenly my sister is offering for both of us to take PTO from work to help her move and for me to drive a large storage pod with my truck. I've told my sister I'm not comfortable hauling anything large for that distance with my old truck but would come out and would haul a small-medium trailer. I also pointed out my work responsibilities changed and I have too many meetings to take off work a day every week (I'm a project manager with a big project launch coming up, my first big project). For reference my sister also has a big truck that is as old as mine but has a newer engine and her family owns 4 total vehicles so if her truck gets damage or wear, she's got others. I do not. I also work two jobs to keep up on bills so I cant afford to lose hours. 
She wants our mom back closer to her children (grandkids) and I don't blame her, but she's really pushed my mom to move. She took charge of the house search and now is taking initiative on the move.  My mom hasn't asked me to help at all, but I recently reached out to my mom and told her I'm willing to help when I can but I'm not comfortable hauling anything large or overloaded and that I'm booked out with work until mid June. I feel like an a-hole after talking to my mom about my limitations,  but I've gotten nearly all information about her moving second hand from my sister who she sees and talks to more than me since my sister has cute grandkids for her and I do not so when my mom makes the drive to the area we live in, she doesn't stop to visit me since she has limited time and wants to spend more with the little kids. 
As an added bonus, one of my sister's older children accidentally broke my hand and it's still not 100% healed so that's another limitation I'm currently dealing with and still in physical therapy.

For reference my sister also has a big truck that is as old as mine but has a newer engine and her family owns 4 total vehicles so if her truck gets damage or wear, she's got others. I do not. I also work two jobs to keep up on bills so I cant afford to lose hours. 
She wants our mom back closer to her children (grandkids) and I don't blame her, but she's really pushed my mom to move. She took charge of the house search and now is taking initiative on the move.  My mom hasn't asked me to help at all, but I recently reached out to my mom and told her I'm willing to help when I can but I'm not comfortable hauling anything large or overloaded and that I'm booked out with work until mid June. I feel like an a-hole after talking to my mom about my limitations,  but I've gotten nearly all information about her moving second hand from my sister who she sees and talks to more than me since my sister has cute grandkids for her and I do not so when my mom makes the drive to the area we live in, she doesn't stop to visit me since she has limited time and wants to spend more with the little kids. 
As an added bonus, one of my sister's older children accidentally broke my hand and it's still not 100% healed so that's another limitation I'm currently dealing with and still in physical therapy. 
So, AITA?

26,1ccfp6i,AITA For Keeping My WiFi To Myself?,"Hello. So my father has been staying with me for several months now and it's not been easy on me at all. To start, he has had unstable employment for years now and I've had to do a lot for him. This includes when I had to pay his rent for the room he stayed in (before getting my apartment, I lived in a couple's room for rent. When they found out he was homeless, they told him he could move into my room. I agreed as I didn't want to see my dad homeless, thhough I was upset since it ruined my newfound privacy and our relationship is shaky to begin with due to his drinking issue.)

When a woman in the room downstairs moved out, I paid for him to move into into it so I could have my space back. I managed to move out and into my 1st apartment which is a very small 1 bdr. However, my dad lost his job again and I had to balance paying my own rent while paying his. He began getting unemployment but that fell through, and instead of having me pay his rent he decided to just bring all his things to my place & crash here. 

It took him a while to find another job. He has a habit of joining temp agencies that are notorious for randomly firing workers & other issues. I've tried again & again to help him with finding employment (buying him interview clothes, managing his emails & filling out applications, researching jobs in the area, practically everything. And it's been *exhausting*. I'm often moody at home because I still have rent and bills to pay on top of everything I do for him, & he often guilts me by complaining about my attitude but I can't help how I feel. I can't roam free in my apartment because he occupies the entire living room, we argue bc he uses up things like my food & tp & he doesn't seem grateful at all. My bills have run up double despite me being home not even half the time, & although he just recently started working again he hasn't given me enough $ to cover all that he's costing me.

So, that brings about my current issue. I just recently installed WiFi. My job is okay but as of late, overtime is heavily restricted so I'm not able to make as much $ as I need. I figured w/ WiFi I can cut back on my phone bill & try to find ways to get a second job from home. The WiFi came with a generic name & password, which I changed as prompted by the app. My dad woke up from his nap & asked if I changed the password. I told him that I changed both. He told me I need to send him the network name & the password. I said that I got the plan with limited amount of devices and that the WiFi is for me (I specified this in my conversation with him yesterday). He got upset & said I ruined his day & when I gave him my explanation again he called it BS. I don't feel like arguing and feel bad, but at the same time he's always guilt tripping me. Rarely anything in my apartment is just for me despite me paying the rent and bills and everything else, but I'm doubting myself here.

28,1ccfftx,AITA for being mad at my bestie,"I’ve talked about her before and I just wanted to let it all out. I enjoy being around her, but I don’t have anybody else in school that I’m really really friends with. She’s the only real friend I have but sometimes she gets out of hand

Whenever I make stuff in class, she copies me a lot. Today in class we were doing slideshow projects and I had an idea and she had hers but then she looked at my idea and then changed her original one to mine. Also last time we did presentations I picked a black theme for mine and she had to pick a black theme too but I’d like to think that was just a coincidence. 

I used to think it was just temporary and I just have a bit of anger issues but it’s a bit serious. My favourite number is 7 because of a whole lot of reasons, 1. My last name starts with D so my number in class is always 7 or 6. 2. When I was little I fell off a bicycle 7th times and on the 7th attempt I fell and got a huge bruise. Real stories.

So one day I was bored in math class so I asked for her favourite number and I would put hers and mine together and calculate the average for a cute little friendship number. Im a nerd I know. And she said 7…. I honestly tried thinking that a lot of people in the world have 7 as their lucky number but also I have a big sister who’s fav number is 16 cause her birthday is literally on the 16 and I would say my fav number is 16 when I was little cause I wanted to be like her. Then my best friend had to have the fav number 16.

Also I feel like she’s starting to dress like me, like the things I would wear a lot she would. Oversized Sweaters, black jackets specifically, black boots or white sneakers. I would think it’s common because a lot of people wear like that but it’s starting to get a bit odd because she also cut her hair short when she grew her hair really long since she was a baby because I got really short hair. She even said to me that she wanted the same length as mine.

On top of that, the ways I sit and talk are a bit replicated from her. I’ve once ranted about this before and they just responded with, “she’s probably just looking up to you” or “maybe she’s tying to find things that will suit her” but I feel like like she’s flat out trying to replicate me

It even got to the point sometimes people confused our names but I feel guilty saying this but her personality is a bit weird. When we hangout she doesn’t even talk unless I talk even though we’ve been friends for 5 years. Whenever I ask her something, she says “whatever” or “you can pick” to the point it gets annoying because every choice is supposed to be mine to make.

I’m a bit scared of dogs and I would laugh about my fear and she would laugh back or joke once and that’ll be fine right? That’s what you would think but she instead every time I see a dog she goes like “Are u scared??” And laughs like she’s trying to lock me but at the same time I don’t think she’s trying to and it just crosses the line every single time.

30,1ccf4hg,AITA for going out with my boyfriend instead of my coworkers? ,"So it was my (24 f) and my boyfriends (26 m) anniversary a couple days ago. Due to us both working that day, we couldn't celebrate until today. I let him pick the place we went to go out to eat, and he happened to choose a place that myself and my coworkers made plans to go to at some point in the near future. There was no official day planned out for us to all go, but we all like this place and knew we wanted to go together. 

Something funny happened while we were there, and I texted the groupchat I have with said coworkers to let them know about it. They both took offense to the fact that I was there without them. I tried explaining that it was for our 5 year anniversary, I wasnt even the one that picked the place, *and* that we made no official plans to go on a specific day. It was more of just a ""what if"" kind of plan. I thought they were joking at first so i kind of laughed it off, but they both said they were mad.

I can kind of understand why they'd be slightly upset, as at no point before this conversation took place did i tell them it was our anniversary and i didn't ever mention it's a place my boyfriend and I frequent a couple times a month. But they both surpassed slightly upset, and were outright *very* angry at me for going without them. Their explanation was simply that we always hype up how fun it would be for us to go together, and they think it's unfair I go without them after getting them both excited. I think they're both wildly overreacting, but I could be wrong. 

Now they won't answer my texts. I work with both of them tomorrow and I'm worried they're actually very upset with me. I don't know if I gave then the wrong impression or what, but if I did something truly wrong, I'd like to know so I can apologize and try to make it up to them.

I do feel kind of dumb even making this post because it seems like such a non issue, but I care about them both so much that I don't want them to be angry with me for any reason especially something as simple as this.

And I just hated how pathetic she stood there, waving her body around because she doesn’t know what to do. I don’t think she means any bad but it really got on my nerves because she is my best friend and she should tell them to move their ass off her desk.

34,1cceyl3,AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months ,"I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up. 

Whenever I asked for an apology about her not taking me seriously she would say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"" and got angry with me for refusing to accept an apology like that. 

I continued to treat her normally after this until November when I was volunteering at her work. I catered an event for her. When we got home, my brother started playing fighting with me and I kicked him back (gently as I do sparring and didn't want to hurt him) when Mom saw, she started screaming at me. I'm fairly certain she was just taking the stress of the day out on me. 

I asked her for a bit of space and started to stay in my room more. She kept coming in my room and refusing to leave me alone. I stopped responding to her and speaking to her and this went on for two months. At the end of the second month, she told me that if I didn't start talking to her again she would take my car and make me quit my job and all of the classes I take outside of school (judo, welding, etc). She also started to accuse me of stuff I've never done. She started trying to diagnose me with stuff and apparently told my grandma. I had to start talking to her because I was scared of what she would do if I didn't. Her therapist said she was doing the right thing and had every right to threaten me as she is my parent.

So AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-25,"AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months  I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up.

There’s a lot more she’s done and said till date. I’ve been just ignoring and just going a long with it but just very recently she said some nasty things to our friend which was not only out of line but she showed her very narrow minded outlook on life, since that day there’s some switch that went off in my head and I just cannot get myself to even exchange a hi or hello over text let alone meet her.
Recently one of her family member has been sick and getting treatment, everyone is paying a visit to see how they are doing. I respectfully decided to not go however, I am always willing to help in any ways shape or form from afar. 
Note: even the family member has said, done things that have been pretty negative and even at one point my mom told me to cut off ties this was back in school but because I was young and that was first time in my life where I had a stable friendship group going that we were a part of, I thought she’s just one person I can handle it but anyways, it’s been way to long to have people like that in my life.

When I got here they guided me up to the third floor where I would be staying in their guest room. It is a pretty small room with a bunch of clutter on one side of the room and a twin bed. The issue arises with that the lamp is so low and dangly in the room that I keep hitting my head on it. Along with that the door opens up directly to the stairs that go to the 2nd floor and are placed awkwardly so that there's no floor outside of the door so the door to the room im in is just on the side of these stairs meaning if you weren't looking while leaving the room you would miss your step and tumble sideways down the stairs. 

The other issue is that much of the house seems not fully built. For example, the floor in my room is this weird rough plywood material and all the stairs have exposed insulation coming out of it and this weird glue substance. Also, the only bathroom is on the first floor and there are no lights in the bathroom and no sink either just a toilet and shower. The house is filled with clutter and trinkets and knick-knacks and everything about it screams hoarder and I can handle a messy house but this truly somehow got to a limit I was shocked existed. Also on the stairs going from the 2nd to first floor there is a stair cover that is made out of a cheap plastic material that you have to lift up and is screwed into the wall with 2 hinges. 

The bed in the room I'm staying in is also horribly uncomfortable and feels like its filled with hay and scraps of paper. All of this has been affecting my sleep since to go to the bathroom at night they don't allow me to turn on lights so I have to use my phone flashlight and carefully exit my room without tumbling down the stairs before lifting up a plastic stair cover and then finally going to the bathroom with no sink.

I told him in the nicest way I could that I couldn't get adequate sleep but he didn't seem to care and said he's slept on the guest bed before and its fine and I am spoiled and expect to much of him.

so, when my neighbors started complaining (a year ago) for parking in certain places i was really confused. the car would be moved routinely and at the time when the complaints started i worked nights. my neighborhood is a bit sketch and i would just park wherever was available and closest to home. i would sometimes park beside our driveway / in front of our neighbors house which consisted of being in front of both of our mailboxes. 

i ended up getting a ticket specifically for blocking their mailbox which i’m pretty sure they called in. they’ve left a note on my car saying “are you not embarrassed, do you not understand, don’t know how to respect not to park here”. they’ve come out to ask me while i’m in my car to move so they can put trash can bins out on days that weren’t pick up dates. these neighbors don’t use the space. they just want to save the space to have it empty, they used to put out their bins and would leave them their for days till someone else in our neighborhood called it in.

yesterday, i parked where i always do but this time i parked in front of the mailboxes so i was a bit in the middle of the available area rather than the edge to avoid possible ticket. my neighbors ended up blocking me in. they parked both their cars like a cm away from both ends of me. i initially called to get them towed but they said they needed to be issued a ticket first which would give them 24 hrs to move & to call 911. which i called the sheriffs number bc it was what i was given to me. he ended up not issuing a ticket & instead talked to us both separately. i feel a bit stupid, i honestly regret my decision but in the moment it felt reasonable lol. i feel like a bit of an asshole for having a bit too extreme. thoughts?

ps. i just wanted them to be issued a ticket just like they issued me one, i thought it would be anonymous!!!

edit: i didn’t mean that i parked in front of the mailboxes again, i parked in front of them leaving the mailbox space free 

edit: y’all i did NOT park in front of their mailbox again. i parked ahead (?) of it meaning i left that space free for the mail man. however, when they blocked me in it meant that THEY parked in front of MY mailbox bc our mailboxes are right beside each other.

I've been trying to get friends or family to join me but the timing never lines up. I've stayed in contact over the years with a buddy from my hometown that I went to middle school with. On one of our recent conversations he mentioned he had just got back from a trip to Peru and really enjoyed it. I figured he's familiar with traveling internationally and he's always been a good guy whenever I return to my hometown for visits, why not invite him to meet me in Mexico? He had never been there before and I thought it would be fun to show him around and have a travel buddy on this trip.

He agrees and we arrange a time and place to meet around the airport in the Mexican town we're traveling to. The day of our flights my flight is delayed by two hours. Getting through immigration takes FOREVER. My buddy arrived about 4 hours before I did and spent that time drinking at the airport bar. When I finally catch up with him, he's completely wasted. He begins accusing the bar staff of stealing his money. He's making really inappropriate comments to other tourists about how hot their wives/girlfriends are. I inform him I'm contacting the Uber and we need to meet him on the street outside the airport as Ubers aren't allowed on airport property. Arrival time for the Uber is 6 minutes, exactly enough time to make it to the street. My friend begins chasing women around the airport trying to get their phone numbers. I finally get him outside and close to the street. He spots a small group of female airport employees on their break on the side of the airport. He begins harassing  them and trying to get their phone numbers. He's not taking ""NO""  for an answer.

When they try to walk away from him, he grabs one of them by the arm and refuses to let go until she gives him her phone number. I plead with him to leave her alone and apologize like crazy to her. I get the notification that the Uber has arrived. I don't want to end up in a Mexican jail so I tell him we have to leave now!

So I work in a very small office. I'm talking 10 people. 9 males; one other woman. This is relevant information. Industry we work in is notoriously male dominated. I just started about a month ago.

I was brought on for part time work and come into the office a few days a week. I have a BOATLOAD of relevant experience and I've known the owner of this company for a long time. I've been looking for a second gig for more money and when I posted seeking more work in this industry he reached out and offered me a job. Basically said ""we need help- we'll start with 3 months see where you really fit within our company and maybe chat full time when that time comes around."" So I'm working part time on the side of my full time job, coming in and doing assistant work for the partners of the company. 

The other female in the office has a similar job and has been there for a few months prior to me. She's been friendly and her title is ""office assistant"" so essentially doing a similar job as I am. Just assisting around the office with things we need.

Immediately off the bat- I get thrown into a ton of projects that are clearly cleaning up a lot of things and finishing up adding information to spreadsheets. a lot of things that ARENT DONE. 

Today me and the one girl in the office get lunch one and one. I was talking to her a small bit about my struggle really getting integrated and knowing what my job is here. Usual new job struggles nothing crazy. Just asking for any advice from when she started.

Her response then really took me aback she super calmly just said ""Well I honestly don't know why they hired you. Honestly, they should've used the money to actual get us a new office""

At that point I kind of just was like ""ummmmm"" it was AWKWARD. I then explained how I got my job and that I know the owner from this industry I've been in it for awhile and he said they need a little extra help.

She then says ""Honestly I know them well... I think you're a diversity hire. They just want more women so they don't look bad. Don't take it personally. It's like being a personality hire.""

I'm somewhat used to being the only woman in the room in this industry but I am EXTREMELY qualified in my past experience and multiple degrees and honestly this position is probably below my pay grade and experience but I wanted the extra funds. I then told her ""don't you think that's a little bit rude to just say?"" to which she proceeds ""Well I'm being honest if you're gonna work here you need to accept that.. I'm helping you here"" with a stank face attitude. She then got up and walked out to her car and the car ride back to work was awkward. I tried to be super nice after that and ""thanked her"" for the advice.

40,1cd6nq1,AITA for not inviting our friends daughter to our daughters birthday party,"My daughter is turning 7 and has been very excited about her birthday but has also decided not to invite our friends daughter.

  
During childcare years, my daughter would be beside herself, refusing to go to childcare because of this other girl. My daughter would tell me this girl would make her sad because she would physically block her from playing with other children, tell her she can't be friends with anyone other than her, and this went on for a while. 

  
My partner and I decided to speak to one of her carers, and she affirmed what is going on and told us she would work with my daughter to be more assertive. At no point did we take the approach that this other girl was doing something bad. The way we raise our children is to teach them to be kind and polite but at the same time to know how to say no, learn what is a good friend and bad friend, and choose who they want to spend time with. The teacher, with our blessing, wrote a letter to the school in the catchment area advising that my daughter should go with a girl she is really close with (now her BFF) and our friend's daughter to another class.

  
The information I am about to write in this sentence we DID NOT share with our friends, but the other parents were delighted because their daughter has the EXACT same challenges as ours with this other girl.

  
My partner and I decided that we have to let them know what is going on but she could not finish the sentence, the other parent EXPLODED. Got really mad saying, why are you saying something is wrong with my child and why did no one tell me so that she can have the opportunity to support her etc..  
 My partner was so shocked by this and felt so bad but managed to salvage the relationship by meeting with the parent over a coffee and explaining the situation. We are taking agency for the situation and not asking for her daughter to change and if they felt they needed to do something for their daughter, that's great. The parent then apologized to my partner admitting they have a tendency to be very emotional about these things and that was that 

  
Well, back to the start of my story 2 years later, my daughter does not want to invite her to her party. Our parenting style has always been based on being kind and considerate but not a people pleaser. She can choose who she wants to be friends with and say no, and that is how we have supported her through this conflict, so to suddenly tell her, yeah, well that lesson we taught you only applies when we feel like it but we as your parents can force you to invite her because we don't want to upset our friends is not something that sits well with me, we need to be consistent. Also remember they aren’t in the same class. They told us how cruel it is that we are excluding her daughter and questioned our values and parenting style  
So in short, am I the asshole?

Got really mad saying, why are you saying something is wrong with my child and why did no one tell me so that she can have the opportunity to support her etc..  
 My partner was so shocked by this and felt so bad but managed to salvage the relationship by meeting with the parent over a coffee and explaining the situation. We are taking agency for the situation and not asking for her daughter to change and if they felt they needed to do something for their daughter, that's great. The parent then apologized to my partner admitting they have a tendency to be very emotional about these things and that was that 

  
Well, back to the start of my story 2 years later, my daughter does not want to invite her to her party. Our parenting style has always been based on being kind and considerate but not a people pleaser. She can choose who she wants to be friends with and say no, and that is how we have supported her through this conflict, so to suddenly tell her, yeah, well that lesson we taught you only applies when we feel like it but we as your parents can force you to invite her because we don't want to upset our friends is not something that sits well with me, we need to be consistent. Also remember they aren’t in the same class. They told us how cruel it is that we are excluding her daughter and questioned our values and parenting style  
So in short, am I the asshole?

42,1cd6dit,AITA for not wanting our “roommate” to move into our new place with us?,"Alright y'all. Let me just start by saying I'm trying to make this as easy as possible for all parties involved, That said I'm not sure how to work this out. For a little background I (29f) got married almost two weeks ago, my husband (32m) and I have lived together for several years, I am the main financial body in the home and I handle all the bills, groceries, finances of all kinds. A friend of ours (35m) in the last several months went though a hard breakup and has been sleeping on our couch, we have just been trying to help him out but not without issue.
He does give us some money here and there to help with groceries/gas/household needs, but he also breaks several of the HOA rules our condo has. He is not on a lease as it’s a private rental for us with a private owner we know but as of the beginning of June we have to relocate because the owner would like to sell the property, he’s been very good to us and we hold no ill will toward him because of his need to sell. We have been on the search over the last two months (he told us we had till June on March first) and with our “roommate” not having a place to stay aside with us we considered having him come along…but as we have lived together over the last couple months my husband and I are finding more and more reasons for not wanting him to come with…those reasons including:
-piles of cigarette butts on our back patio (against HOA) 
- not keeping his space clean (i.e mostly full cans of soda on our table close to the edge and stacked on top of one another, dirty clothes, just general trash) 
- he doesn’t help with household chores, including dishes, taking out the dogs (one of which is his) any cleaning of any kind…
One thing that really gets me is knocking once when our bedroom door is obviously closed and then proceeding to just walk in after the first time…

Now we are looking at places to move to and found one very recently that will allow his dog (an 8-10 year old Pitt bull) but has many other rules, he would not be allowed to smoke on property and would have to walk to the street…it’s not a big complex hit this was a point of contention for him. He would also have to par with one of his animals (likely his cat) because there is a limit of two pets per unit. We would also be parting ways with our cats to follow this rule, he’s complained about having to follow certain rules or leaving his car behind..along with his inability to clean up after himself or respect our space and it’s to the point we don’t want him to come along. How do we nicely tell him we want to live on our own as many married couples do?

I 16M and my friend 15M had an argument because he was complaining about how he’s unable to not care when people shit on their art.

 It started when I was recommending stuff that would really help them with their account and they started complaining about how they don’t have motivation and professionalism but, also because people shit on his art. I tried to explain that people who say that don’t really matter. It continues and, he said he can’t control the fact that it bothers him when others shit on his art. I tried to explain that it doesn’t matter and if you take time to work on it won’t bother you. 

It continued as a back and forth argument trying to explain how I want to help him work on it so he’s less afraid to push his art out. He then said I’m not listening to him because he can’t control it and that he knows it life and such. He then sent a voice message of him crying how I’m not listening and this is why he doesn’t complain about anything and that all he wants is support from others.

 I tried to explain that it’s ok to complain but if you do it too much it pushes people away because of it and I’m willing to support him but only if he willing to listen and change. Later after more back in forth about how it’s ok to change but complaining will push others away he responds with “I dont give a fuck. If they cant handle it fuck them And if you cant handle it fuck you. Its a normal thing to complain”

I tried to explain that’s it’s ok to think like that because it pushes away and stops the people who want to help you change for the better. It continues to be just constant argument. 

After a while he then says that “what if I don’t want to change what if I want to be the same stay where I am” and, then started listing of people who support the fact he doesn’t change. 
 
It just continues on then with more argument and then stopped after he said “what if I don’t want help. What if I’m ok with it and I want to do things for myself.”

I understand why he thinks like that I used to be like that because like him I hated everyone. I never fitted in either and just wanted to be in my bubble with people who let me do this and that. I just want to help tho give him support to push him self out and into the world. Not be in the bubble of safety like he wants to.

48,1cd66d4,AITA for not cooking dinner because I'd already done most of the housework?,"I (30M) work from home, my wife (25F) works in an office nearby.

Yesterday before heading to work my wife asked me to hang up the washing that she'd done at some point during the day.

I went and hung it all up, it was an absolute ton of washing that we'd both neglected, no problem. Fair enough.

I carried on with my workday and got a text from her about being hungry and looking forward to dinner.

I took one look at the kitchen and saw a mountain of dirty dishes and pans and stuff and just sighed to myself.

I'm cooking for her almost every day of the week, the washing also gets left for me to hang otherwise it never gets done.

The dishes are also left for me on top of the cooking, so before I can even cook I have to wash everything.

Even if I cook, she won't wash up, which is supposed to be the fair way to do things.

I've tried bringing this up to her many times, gently and more firmly but regardless of what I say she gets defensive or complains she's busy or tired or hates doing X chore.

But then it just means everything gets left to me.

I'm so tired of feeling like all these things are purposely being left to the point where I'm forced into doing them.

I really don't mind cooking or doing my fair share but why am I being left to do EVERYTHING? :(

I've ended up suggesting eating out or just ordering takeaway so many times because I can't stomach the fact I'm doing all the work, it physically makes me feel ill with stress, shame and frustration.

I've had to empty the bins out pretty much every time for the past 6 months too otherwise it just piles up and she starts just letting it fall out the top or even worse just scattering things around the bottom of the garbage can.

I picked up 20! TWENTY! Rolled up tissues she'd used and thrown towards the garbage can, missed and just not bothered to pick up the other day.

Her dirty clothes are all over the floor, so if I don't put them in the machine they'll just stay there until I inevitably have to hang them again.

Yes I work from home, but I'm working, it doesn't mean I do everything...

She'll come home, eat the food I cooked, go on her phone, sleep for like 12 hours, go to work and the cycle repeats. No attempt to help. I really don't get it.

Yesterday he broke up with me after he said he wanted to go out drinking with his friends. I told him I don’t want him to do that as Wednesdays he is supposed to be here with me and helping put my son to bed. (We’ve been together a year and a half and my son refuses to sleep most nights unless he’s here) I had been up since midnight at he was telling me this right before he was supposed to go out while still not being at mine. He was supposed to go to a festival this weekend but his friends changed there mind and he didn’t have money so I was going to give him some to go. So I was saying no to going out as after a year and a half and by his wish he has responsibilities to my son. Defending my 2 1/2 year olds routine as it’s important to him as he’s autistic. He broke up with me. 

The last time I saw him in person we were talking about wedding rings and laughing and joking. And now he’s claiming he’s been losing feelings for a while. He has been parading that we’re a “little family” spending loads of money on a night out last month for a date night. And spending over £200 on my Christmas presents and around that for my son. 

We’ve worked hard to get to a point where on Wednesday we both won’t be stressed as much as my son would go to a special nursery and that means that all of my appointments I can take will be for when he’s there. So it’s less stress for the month of us. But he claims he can’t handle the stress 

I don’t know why but his actions aren’t matching his words and I’m left heartbroken with a son who’s begging for my ex. And it feels like he’s just throwing a temper tantrum.

51,1cd5laf,AITA for saying i cant rely on my bf bc he didnt wake me up,"my (22f) boyfriend (23 m) knew i had an exam today and we had agreed he would wake me up. he sometimes is annoyed that i dont set my own alarms but the issue is that he will turn off my alarms if i dont wake up to mine first. Also, if hes going to set an alarm why would i set one myself for the same time? 

The problem is he works late. He got home 12:30am and we live in a studio. he kept telling me that he would finish up on his phone in a few minutes and put away the food he made,  and i just waited for him until 2 am. 

I woke up exhausted at 7am and hit snooze which annoyed him to hear two alarms, but then i was so tired i could barely move or stay awake. It was around 10:30 at this point and i asked him ""hey im having a really hard time i need sleep. can you wake me in like 30 minutes?"" 

He says okay, maybe in his sleep and not fully conscious but I also wasnt fully present so i just crashed and fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes after my exam started and he just said ""youre going to miss your exam"" and i said ""why didnt you wake me?""

Then, this is what upset me. He said it was my fault and I shouldve gone to bed earlier and that i shouldnt have expected him to listen because he was tired. 

I feel like he shouldve said ""oh fuck were both really exhausted and idk how this happened either. lets go"" Like i dont care whose fault it was, we BOTH were exhausted. I just don't like that he's saying im irresponsible because I was exhausted and he's not. 

Thankfully I made it to my exam but he still thinks this is all my fault and im irresponsible. I wouldnt have relied on him in the first place if he didnt tell me i could have and it worries me that he will sabotage me in other ways if i fix this. My therapist suggested buying headphones so I only hear the alarm and don't have to worry about it bothering him and him turning it off. 

I told him this and said he let me down and he shouldnt have only blamed me and that if you agree to a responsibility you have to honor it. I just hate that he thinks if he doesnt like a responsibility after it was decided on that he can just not do it. 

He also said I dont even cook for him enough because months ago we agreed that he'd buy groceries and id cook them. But, he also said he'd help do the cleaning and he never does a good job, he just does the dishes and puts all my spices and cooking supplies on high shelves I cant reach and I have to ask him each time. I understand the logic of ""your needs are your responsibility"" about waking up but he doesn't even understand that its hypocritical to expect me to spend hours cooking each day and cleaning up after both of us but I cant ask him to wake me up every once in a while?  

TLDR: boyfriend didnt wake me up and i missed my exam and then he called me irresponsible. I told him he shouldnt agree to things and then not do them.

About 3 years ago, me and my family went to a new church and it was there that my son met his now wife. At the time, I thought she was really sweet and I really wanted them to get together. I was very excited and supportive. We saw them every other day for dinner. After 5 months of dating, they got engaged and I was very happy for them. They began preparing for their January wedding and my son bought a house 2 weeks after their engagement.   


  
Everything was fine, until one day, 7 weeks before the wedding. My son's fiancee came over and it was clear that they were fighting. They went to our family room where they proceeded to sit in silence while I made dinner. I served dinner, and they were both not talkative. My son's fiancee didn't even talk to me! Shortly after dinner, they left with only a few short exchanges of conversation. I was furious. Me and my husband told our son that she was never allowed in our home again because she disrespected me. After a few days, we agreed to meet with them, and I made it clear to her that she couldn't behave like that in my house. I expressed that she hadn't been raised right if she wasn't even going to talk to me in my own house and that we didn't raise my son like that. I expected this to fix things, but it got worse.

However, I’ve been away from home country for over a decade and I am having to deal with issues related to cultural differences On a daily basis with my parents.

No matter how hard I explain things that are done differently here to them, they don’t seem to try to acknowledge it.

Very recently, I let them know about what our daughter’s Pediatrician told us; not to kiss the baby directly in her mouth. My mom did it anyway today.

I was upset and mad that she didn’t respect that. In fact, there are other things they just listen and ignore. I feel like my words mean nothing to them. I burst into anger today.

In my parent’s defense, “It would be an unbelievable thing to say back in home country. I was raised by feeding from their mouth (making food softer by chewing). I acted as if the baby is going to get a disease from them.”

I am exhausted from these kind of incidents with them. I can’t stay quiet because I can’t unsee them disregarding the things I request them to follow.  I am not sure what to do. I have already tried explaining things when everyone is calm. However, these things keep happening.

My mom told me that she feels like I don’t treat her close to our puppy. Another thing they don’t like is the request I made to not post our daughter’s picture in facebook. Dad did it anyway and when I was upset about it, obviously it didn’t go well.

I want to take a stance and say I won’t pay, but that they could still do it. Much like if I was a vegan, I’m not going to join a burger eating competition for a laugh but I’d still cheer them on. 

However, if I drop out then my friends have to pay more and I’d be riding on the coattails of their gift because I don’t care about my teacher enough to individually buy him a gift.

57,1cd4pkt,AITA for being silent/grumpy during family dinners.,"I (23M) still live at home with my parents, and while I love my family (dad 57, mom 60, brother 24) and enjoy spending time with them, I dread having dinner together. The sound of eating is like nails on a chalkboard for me, making family dinners far from enjoyable, especially when they're spent in silence most days.  
  
I've tried to communicate that it's not their company that makes me uncomfortable during meals, but rather the sound of chewing. However, tonight marked the second occasion where one of my parents had a significant emotional outburst about my behavior during dinner. Their frustration boiled down to accusations of ingratitude because my brother and I don't cook or pay for dinner yet show up looking glum and uncommunicative. While it's true that we don't prepare meals or foot the bill, this issue had never been expressed until now. Our role has always been to clean the kitchen afterward, which, I acknowledge, pales in comparison to the effort of cooking every night and the expense of food.  
  
During a previous confrontation, my mom expressed her disdain for my glum attitude at the dinner table. I explained the issue with sound sensitivity, and we agreed to try listening to music during dinner to drown out the chewing noises. While this helped somewhat, it wasn't a solution for various reasons.  
  
I understand that this is probably mainly about not cooking or contributing financially for the food. I'm willing to take on cooking duties and cover the costs of any meals I prepare. However, I also resent the idea of having to fake enjoyment while feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Home should be a place where I can relax and be myself, not where I have to put on a facade.  
  
Moreover, I'm frustrated by the emotional explosions and the lack of effective communication. Perhaps I'm just dense and can't pick up on subtle signals, but I find it hard to navigate these situations.  
  
As for my brother, I can't speak to why he behaves similarly during dinner because I simply don't know his thoughts or feelings on the matter.

58,1cd4hwe,AITA for not making my daughter work or move out?,"I'm a single dad of a 19 year old daughter. Her mother passed away when she was 4. Ever since then I've been raising her alone. I haven't dated anyone since my ex passed, I've had a few casual hookups here and there, a few ""friends with benefits"" but nothing serious. I was too busy with my daughter, managing my company, renovating my house to even consider dating. 

I grew up poor, I first started working when I was 16. When I was 18 and finished school I was working 60+ hour weeks. I eventually started my own logistics company which meant even more hours. I always promised myself that if I had a kid they wouldn't have to go through what I went through. I tried to provide for my daughter as best as I could. I always paid for her hobbies whether it was horse riding when she was 9 or guitar lessons when she was 12. She's 19 now, she doesn't officially have a job but she works part time as a ""social media manager"" at my company, she basically manages the pages for my company. Makes new posts, replies to comments etc. On top of that she's taking photography classes and has done a few paid gigs. When she finished high school she said she didn't want to go to college which I supported. All I ever wanted was for her to have the chance to follow her dreams and passions, something I could never do. Yes I know she's a bit spoiled, she lives for free with me, I pay for everything, her car, phone, her photography classes. But I don't have an issue with that. 

Anyways, six months ago I started dating this woman I met through online dating that my daughter helped me set up a year ago. This whole thing was her idea. We don't live together but she spends most weekends at my place. But recently she started having an issue with my daughter. She doesn't like the fact that my daughter is ""spoiled"".

I'm a single dad of a 19 year old daughter. Her mother passed away when she was 4. Ever since then I've been raising her alone. I haven't dated anyone since my ex passed, I've had a few casual hookups here and there, a few ""friends with benefits"" but nothing serious. I was too busy with my daughter, managing my company, renovating my house to even consider dating. 

I grew up poor, I first started working when I was 16. When I was 18 and finished school I was working 60+ hour weeks. I eventually started my own logistics company which meant even more hours. I always promised myself that if I had a kid they wouldn't have to go through what I went through. I tried to provide for my daughter as best as I could. I always paid for her hobbies whether it was horse riding when she was 9 or guitar lessons when she was 12. She's 19 now, she doesn't officially have a job but she works part time as a ""social media manager"" at my company, she basically manages the pages for my company. Makes new posts, replies to comments etc. On top of that she's taking photography classes and has done a few paid gigs. When she finished high school she said she didn't want to go to college which I supported. All I ever wanted was for her to have the chance to follow her dreams and passions, something I could never do. Yes I know she's a bit spoiled, she lives for free with me, I pay for everything, her car, phone, her photography classes. But I don't have an issue with that. 

Anyways, six months ago I started dating this woman I met through online dating that my daughter helped me set up a year ago. This whole thing was her idea. We don't live together but she spends most weekends at my place. But recently she started having an issue with my daughter. She doesn't like the fact that my daughter is ""spoiled"".

I was asked to be a filler for a ticket that was already bought. I have never been on an actual vacation out of the U.S. and only done one beach trip when I was a teenager.   


This ticket was for another family member who was able to get off work when the tickets were bought (months ago) but now the family member had lay offs at work and doesn’t know if they will be able to get off for the trip in June. 



Since the tickets are none refundable I was asked if I would like to go in the family member place if they couldn’t make it. I agreed.   


The departure date is the same day as my Bfs birthday. He freaked out when he found out and said his ex always did stuff with Her family on the days he found important and ruined his (their) vacations. 



We already compromised on this and where planning a trip to Orlando just the two of us at the end of May. I never once said to him I was not going to celebrate his birthday and was actually planning on doing things already, I was definitely going to celebrate it before I left no matter what day we both had off from work. but me saying it’s not about the day that matters, it’s about who you spend that day with, who is with you on ur big day, didn’t sit well with him.



 He broke up with me because i refused to say no to going…. When I was not even going technically, it was still up in the air. The family member still has first dibs if they can get off work.

I have two daughters Jenna and Kiera both married (f, 38 and 37).   All of our kids are independent and living on their own.  His boys have families but don’t live anywhere near us.  My girls recently received an inheritance from their grandfather of close to 1 million each.  They are being responsible with it.  One is saving a big portion of it for retirement and her son’s education.  The other doesn’t have kids and doesn’t live near us.  So this is about the one who lives close to us and has a pre-school son, Kyle. 

My husband has gotten very upset lately about the help I am giving Jenna with babysitting Kyle before pre-school and in the afternoons 2-3 days a week.  He is a good eater and likes things that are driving up our food bill maybe 40-50.00 a month.  Husband resents me not getting paid for the food and to a lesser degree  my time.  He says it isn’t fair to his grandkids that they are not being treated fairly.  I suggested he send the grandkids’ parents money for treats each month.  He wants me to charge Jenna and then not have to give his grandkids anything.  I don’t want to charge Jenna anything.  I don’t think that grandparents should charge for childcare or food. 

He gets aggravated if he sees a new colouring book or markers here. He seethes with rage at times if I invite Jenna’s family for a meal.   He thinks Jenna and to a lesser degree Kiera should be helping us instead of hoarding their money.   He also gets very agitated about me not telling him if Kyle is going to be here.  He says that he doesn’t feel like it is his home and that I make all the decisions.  He is threatening to break up our marriage over the disparity and unfairness of the situation.  

Some info on our finances: Money isn’t plentiful but we both have pretty good pensions. After our bills are paid we have between 2 and 3 thousand a month to spend on groceries, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. We have very minimal savings.   He travels to see his grandkids maybe 2-3 times a year.  One he flies to see and the other he takes the train or drives.  Averages out maybe 500.00 a trip.  I don’t travel at all.

61,1cd4507,AITA for calling my step mum strange and obsessive?,"My (F16) dad, Liam (M34) got married a couple years ago to a woman, Tilly (F40). She's not in the least similar to his ex girlfriends, all who were quite fun, lively and usually either modelled or worked in the arts. She works in a pre approved school and likes to act as if I was one of the students there.

Liam used to be eccentric before he met her, he's still usually energetic and funny when she's not around, but she does keep him on a tight leash. He's given up modelling and painting for a conventional job, he gets his haircut into the style that she likes, which is very short and she's practically remodelled him into her ideal partner. Based in how Liam was before he met her, I was raised pretty unconventionally too. We moved around a lot, I learned to be very social, I went to most parties he attended, I'd usually get to miss school to go on little coffee dates with him and whoever he was dating at the time in posh London cafes. I usually dressed however I wanted.

The girl he was with prior to Tilly, Cherry (F33), was his longest relationship. She is my mam as far as I'm concerned. We all lived in her apartment in a lively part of London, so we frequently went out. I was used to Cherry taking me out to get our hair done together, or clothes shopping or for brunch. She'd always buy me the most beautiful clothes. Cherry even managed to get me modelling gigs when I was a kid. Of course, when Liam married Tilly, all that went down the gutter, she out of nowhere started to control what I wore, even how I spoke. She tried her best to treat me as if I was a little kid, forcing me into all these twee, little girly activities and outfits and whatever.

I still speak to Cherry on a regular basis. I told Cherry that I was still interested in modelling and she managed to book me a gig! It was great, Cherry took me out for the day to get both hair and lash extensions put in, my nails gently manicured and get some new clothes, we spent the rest of the day just lolling about her apartment.

When I came home, Tilly was extremely upset that Cherry allowed me to alter my appearance, even though it wasn't altered that much. She started ranting about it and asking me to take my extensions out. I told her that I couldn't, that Cherry had managed to book me a modelling shoot and I can't just ruin all the work she paid for, which set Tilly off. Tilly said that it was a stupid vanity contest and that Cherry shouldn't be encouraging me to do things like that, or allowing me to alter my appearance without her consent. I yelled at Tilly that she was acting super obsessive and strange, that she shouldn't act as if she holds some kind of ownership over me - its a simple photoshoot and literally just the most unnoticeable extensions you could get.

62,1cd3ydd,AITAH for telling my bsf of 10 years that she’s a horrible person?,"I 18f have been best friends w a girl, let’s call her Leigh (18f.) 
She’s been through a lot and has picked up smoking, vaping, etc. she dropped out of hs, is unemployed and overall has no motivation in life. 
I’ve highly encouraged her to try to gain independence, as she relies on her mother for everything. She refuses. 
(For future context, her parents are going through a divorce rn and her mom is working two jobs.)
I called her yesterday, and she asked me if she could get cash back at Aldi’s. I asked why, and she said “well my mom won’t by me nic and im out. So im gonna take her card, get $20 cash back, and tell her I got food.”

I was shocked and I said “wait… so you’re stealing from your mom?”
She immediately gets super defensive, saying “well im out of nic” “I need it” and etc. as someone who doesn’t use nic, I don’t see the issue. She gets paid about 50 bucks a week for helping her mom clean, so I saw no reason why she couldn’t wait for that. 

I told her that her mom works really hard, working two jobs, trying to provide for three kids. 
She starting going off on me, saying “my mom has money, I know she does. She’s getting money from dad from the divorce” while I know that is 100% untrue. Her mom works two jobs and is never home and is always worried about money. 

I told her that even if her mom does have money, it doesn’t matter. Lying to her mom is still something super crappy, especially when her mom pays for her food, hair care, clothing, and even for ‘fun’ stuff she likes to do over the weekend. 

I expressed that it’s unfair to her mother and super selfish to say it’s okay to steal from her just because “I need to take a hit.” 

She tried defending herself, “I need it” “it’s my mom it’ll be fine” “she won’t know, ive done it before” and I just kept reiterating about how crappy it is that she did that. 

I made sure to specify that I support her, but not that action. I can’t get behind her stealing from her mother for a non-necessity. I’m not the type to go to her mother and tell her, but I highly encouraged her to give back the money she’s taken in the past and to get over it and simply wait for more money in the future that is ACTUALLY hers. 

After like the fifth time I heard her say “well I need it” I got fed up and told her that only a horrible person would do that to their own mother. 

Eventually, she got fed up, told me to block her, and hung up on me. She has since sent me passive aggressive messages saying “well you made me feel bad so now I don’t have nic” and all I say to that is well good.

So basically, my friend is stealing from her mother, I call her out, she gets mad at me, I tell her that she shouldn’t, and she ends up getting mad at me and hangs up on me.

63,1cd3tic,AITA for telling my epileptic friend to stop deliberately doing seizure-causing things?,"Paula (35F) and I (30F) have been close friends since high school. Both of us are autistic, and Paula is also epileptic. She missed a good portion of high school due to the frequency and severity of her seizures. Despite this, Paula gets super excited and enthusiastic about doing anything that can cause seizures or is dangerous in the event one occurs. 

Upside-down amusement rides are the biggest one: if we’re going to a carnival or amusement park, she’ll ask if there are any upside-down rides, ask if any individual ride I mention goes upside-down, and talk about how excited she is to ride the upside-down rides. She’ll also get really excited to visit attractions with strobe lights, sleep on bunk beds and drink alcohol. Paula is the only person I know of in the whole universe who gets excited over strobe lights. 

The staff of her day and recreation programs will stop her from doing any of these things because it is in her service plan from the state office of developmental disabilities that she should not be allowed to. Paula asked her doctor to take these restrictions out of her service plan, but he refused. As such, she jumps at the chance to do these things when we are out without any  “staff “ caregivers around. The staff also make Paula wear a life jacket while swimming, which Paula resents because she thinks it makes her look like a little kid. Paula perceives all of this as the staff discriminating against people with epilepsy, and I have not been able to convince her otherwise.

I was on Paula’s side for a while because she had been seizure-free for over ten years. I had even given her advice on how to appeal the doctor’s decision. However, she recently had seizures again as the result of playing video games for too long a period of time. I thought this would scare Paula away from doing seizure-causing things, but she did not change at all.

The last time Paula and I got together, I told her either she stops deliberately doing things that are dangerous for people with epilepsy, or I will stop hanging out with her. Paula was incensed, angrily arguing with me about how it isn’t fair that she doesn’t get to do things other people can do, she takes meds to control the seizures, and that she was able to go seizure-free for so long. Paula has gone on upside-down rides and in strobe-lit haunted houses before without having seizures. However, she also spent nearly all of her free time playing video games before without having seizures.

Looking back on this conversation, I realize I may have been an asshole. I’m Paula’s friend, not her care aide. It may not be my place to enforce this. She is ultimately responsible for herself when not in the presence of care aides. I’m also aware that the doctor only refuses to remove the restriction to avoid getting in trouble if she has a seizure again afterwards.

Yesterday evening, me (21F) and my friend (22F) spend the day ""catching up"" because we hadn't had time to properly talk because of work. Last time I had seen her, which was about 2 months ago, she'd started to go to church more and became more faithful to her religion. I am not religious at all- I am atheist.

When we met up, she immediately asked me if I had converted to Christianity yet, to which I replied no to, and rubbed it off as a joke. However, I became more annoyed over the evening as she kept trying to convert me, and I had already told her I wasn't interested.

At the end of the evening, she asked me why I don't believe in God, so I told her the reason why- that I believe in science and i showed her how some parts of science dont match up with some parts of the Bible. She got offended and acted like I insulted her, and started yelling swear words at me. I told her that she shouldn't have asked if she was going to get offended, then I left.

She sent me several messages that were passages from the Bible, and kept saying that because I denied faith in God, I'd get sent to hell.
Some of our mutual friends called me an asshole for refusing her help as she was helping me ""find myself"", whereas some called her the asshole for pushing her religion onto others.

She got offended and acted like I insulted her, and started yelling swear words at me. I told her that she shouldn't have asked if she was going to get offended, then I left.

She sent me several messages that were passages from the Bible, and kept saying that because I denied faith in God, I'd get sent to hell.
Some of our mutual friends called me an asshole for refusing her help as she was helping me ""find myself"", whereas some called her the asshole for pushing her religion onto others.

65,1cd3mpw,"WIBTA if I told my friend her ""looking out for me"" was attention seeking during finals week?","Since I transferred to my university I've (21F) been friends with a woman I'll call Marie (24F). When my boyfriend (22M) who I'll call Ben, and I started dating, we realized she was our mutual friend. The three of us were close friends and hung out a lot, until Marie got very upset with Ben after he gave her advice she didn't agree with at a party I hosted. 

I didn't hear the whole conversation but Marie has a very turbulent love life and mental health that she's very open about, and seems to put off men. She's had terrible boyfriends in the past. Ben suggested she not give out her love so freely, which upset her. 

Ben apologized but Marie wanted a longer conversation with Ben, which she vented to me about. I didn't like her venting to me about Ben. Ben got irritated because he genuinely apologized, but he doesn't want to know all about her past traumas to be friends with her. It's finals week and he doesn't have the time. 

When I'm able to and she needs help I usually am there for her, but after that and with finals week it was hard for me. Yesterday she called me and I declined, so she texted me that she needed to ""talk to me asap... it's very important"". I asked if she was safe and said she was but she had important information I needed to know. This really stressed me out, and I figured it must be very important to tell me mid finals week. 

I call her and she told me something she found out about Ben from over two years ago, before either of us met him. I am not saying what that was here because it isn't anyone's business. I will say that it was nothing illegal or terrible. I am loyal, but not stupid. It's a red flag I would have walked away from if I'd just met him, but this is my long term boyfriend who I trust, love, and treats me and the world very well, each day through actions and words. I took it calmly on the phone, but Marie seemed very upset by this. 

Ben and I had a good conversation out of it. He said it was true, it was the lowest point in his life, and he wished I'd heard it from him. We aren't ones to talk at length about our past traumas so it never came up. We focus on building a future together, we are very healthy, and it feels strange that she would tell me this during finals week after being upset with Ben. If this ended or hurt our relationship which she seemed to expect, I could have failed my classes from added stress. 

I know she was trying to be a good friend and look out for me, but it feels really selfish that she brought up this information at this time, and it feels gossipy and juvenile to bring up Ben's teenage past at her 24 year old age. I did lots of stupid shit when I was nineteen that I wouldn't want Ben to know about and he doesn't want to know. 

People are different, relationships are different. I want to believe she had good intentions but the way she went about it, the dramatic texts and timing felt so attention seeking.

66,1cd3j7t,WIBTA for wanting to uninvite a group of friends to my birthday,"For context, I am not the type to really want to celebrate my birthday at all, let alone extravagantly.

This past year, I joined a new gym and quickly realised how cliquey it truly was between a few members, especially in particular sessions when both groups would tend to show up. I myself, have no issues with anyone since this has been going on since way before I joined and none of them have done anything wrong to me personally. All have welcomed me with opened arms, though I would say I’m slightly closer to one group (Jane and Julie) as we usually commute to and from the gym together. With the other group, we actually have banter and is just nice to constantly have a laugh. 

This year, I’ve decided to head into London for a night out to celebrate and originally just wanted my close friends from school. However, thought it’d be nice to invite more people as I have finally started coming out of my shell again (I also know mixing groups can sometimes be awkward). When I mentioned this to Jane and Julie, I told them I was opening the invite to everyone at the gym. Jane in particular, said she didn’t want to go anymore and made it clear it was because the other group going (as Julie was busy my bday weekend and Jane didn’t want to end up alone). I said I didn’t want to be put in the middle but they told me I’ve pretty much sided with the other group. I personally feel that it was selfish of her to even say that to begin with and would have much rathered a “don’t think I’ll be able to make it but let’s do a bday dinner when your free”, just so that it was more about the celebrant rather than her personal issues with other people. Or at least that’s what I would’ve done, situation reversed.

This has now made me not want to celebrate my birthday at all as I don’t want it to be awkward at the gym. I’ve finally found a place I truly feel comfortable to work on myself but I hate that it’s come down to this.

67,1cd360r,AITA for snapping at a disabled person?,"Hey all.

I (17F) am in a theatre class with two girls, Emily (18F) and Ruby (17F). 

Emily and I have been friendly since middle school. We're both autistic and in a few dance classes together, so we kinda gravitated toward each other because nobody else liked either of us. I've never found it particularly easy to get along with Emily, though.

She has a short temper and often lashes out, screaming and insulting and stomping her feet whenever something annoys her. I kinda get it, though, since I know what it's like to be overwhelmed when plans change or when sensory issues come up, so I've always been supportive of her and just smile and nod along with whatever she wants.

The other day, though, was different. Ruby and I were practicing our class monologues together, and Emily kept interrupting to yell at us that we should shut up or that our performances were bad. I knew she was probably in the middle of a meltdown, and I was used to just stepping back, smiling, and nodding when she got like this, so I didn't say much at first.

Then Emily started targeting Ruby, though. She called Ruby annoying and got in her face insulting her and yelling. I don't know what happened, but I guess that crossed some kind of line for me, because I snapped at Emily to leave us alone and go sit with the teachers if she couldn't handle being here.

Emily seemed hurt and angry (i admittedly raised my voice at her) and screamed at me that she'd never take advice from someone who ""dresses like a clown"" and ""couldn't even manage her weight"" (i'm admittedly on the fatter side).

I called her a bad person and then walked back to the black box with Ruby because we didn't want to be screamed at anymore. We told the teachers that Emily was disrupting our practice, but they scolded us for not being more accommodating of a student with disabilities and that I wouldn't get it because I'm more ""high functioning"" than Emily.

My argument is that I actually DO understand what it's like to have autistic meltdowns and be overstimulated, but that it doesn't give Emily a license to get in people's faces screaming and insulting them, and that even IF she's actually physically incapable of containing her rage when she's in that kind of state, then it's still her job to go somewhere private instead of cornering other kids for just doing their class work!

Still, though, I feel bad, especially since Emily and I have been friends for years. I'm used to her acting like this, and I've never lost my temper on her before, so why is it suddenly okay for me to do it now? Plus she IS disabled and I know meltdowns are hard, plus I know not all autistic people are the same, so she may not be able to handle things the same way I do.

68,1cd32a7,AITA for giving my parents the silent treatment for outing me?,"Some backstory before I start, me and my dad have the best relationship, he’s like one of my best friends and biggest supporter in all my achievements, however my relationship with my mum isn’t the greatest due to her own personal issues which negatively reflected on me in my childhood and for that we aren’t as close. Now on to the issue,  In 2020 I came out to both my parents, my Mum was very supportive as her best friend is a lesbian, my dad wasn’t really bothered and said it wouldn’t change how he saw me, however whenever it came to pride things I never really went to him about it just because I knew he probably wouldn’t get it, but that didn’t bother me.

 Fast forward to yesterday, my dad and I were in the car coming home from McDonald’s for our dinner and as we were waiting at a red light I brought up the fact I wanted to come out to the rest of my family (I have quite a large family and only my cousin knew as she and I are very close), and without a pause he said to me “they already know” I got extremely confused and said back “what do you mean? I haven’t told them” to which he said “no, your mum and I told them” at this point I was getting very panicked, frustrated and upset and I was finding it difficult to put my words together, so I told him “why didn’t you ask me? You had no right to do that without telling me” and all he said back was “I’m allowed to talk to family about things” this made me cry because I had never felt so betrayed before. 

As soon as we got home I had a go at my mum telling her “you had no right to tell people my sexuality without telling me” and went to my room. Earlier today I got up and ignored both my parents when they tried speaking to me and I went straight downstairs to get breakfast, when I tried to go back upstairs my dad blocked the door and told me to sit down, he pretty much told me over again and again about how he’s “allowed to talk to family about me” and how “my sexuality isn’t just about me” I was now sobbing sat on the sofa as I just kept repeating “you outed me” and  “you had absolutely no right “ because that’s all I could get out, I was so angry that they had taken something so personal away from me because I now couldn’t come out to my own family when I wanted to, and he had the nerve to say “I didn’t out you, don’t use that word it’s very negative” like I was a child.

We lived together for 2 1/2 years up until I married my husband (M31) last year. We became very close to me and my husband and was a huge part of making our wedding so special..Right after we got married she started dating Mark (M25). He was clingy but he seemed sweet and treated her like a queen. Overtime he distanced her from all her friends and none of us saw her anymore.

She and I had a trip planned to Cabo and 3 months before I thought it’d be nice to open it up to our SOs so they wouldn’t feel left out. She had only been dating Mark 4 months but they seemed serious. (They ended up getting engaged 2 two weeks before our trip).I hadn’t seen Natalie in months and I kept asking if we could have some 1:1 time, not a whole day but just 1-2 hours. She kept avoiding the subject and my husband decided to reach out to Mark to plan a guys night, so Natalie and I could also have time. I hadn’t asked him to do that but he saw how stressed I was and he also wanted to get to know Mark better. Mark said no and that he “only wanted to be with his fiance during our trip.” I was really upset and after a lot of back and forth Natalie asked me to apologize to Mark for “not getting his help to plan the trip.” I was so confused how this was the root of the issue since there was nothing to plan. All we did was book a hotel but I wanted to resolve things so I sent a text apologizing (that she approved). His response back was so hurtful saying I was being manipulative and making him look bad by running to Natalie behind his back. All I was trying to do was plan a single meal or drinks with my friend on a 5 day vacation. My husband ended up sending a text to mark being more direct and clarifying the situation. Mark lost it and canceled their reservations. 

It’s been 5 months and I kept trying to make plans with Natalie. She still wanted me to be a bridesmaid and I got a dress (which she approved). We finally saw each other for the first time two weeks ago and while it was awkward at times it was still fun. A week later she sent me a text that they are no longer inviting my husband to the wedding but she still wanted me in the wedding. I was furious. The wedding is 5 weeks away. I backed out and said I’m sticking with my husband. While she was a good friend to me at times this last year she has been MIA and I was 100% going to pick my husband over her. While I appreciate she’s doing something similar by sticking with her fiance I am just so confused how she thought it was normal to not invite my SO (to a 200+ wedding). It just felt like Mark was trying to make a statement by excluding my husband.

(They ended up getting engaged 2 two weeks before our trip).I hadn’t seen Natalie in months and I kept asking if we could have some 1:1 time, not a whole day but just 1-2 hours. She kept avoiding the subject and my husband decided to reach out to Mark to plan a guys night, so Natalie and I could also have time. I hadn’t asked him to do that but he saw how stressed I was and he also wanted to get to know Mark better. Mark said no and that he “only wanted to be with his fiance during our trip.” I was really upset and after a lot of back and forth Natalie asked me to apologize to Mark for “not getting his help to plan the trip.” I was so confused how this was the root of the issue since there was nothing to plan. All we did was book a hotel but I wanted to resolve things so I sent a text apologizing (that she approved). His response back was so hurtful saying I was being manipulative and making him look bad by running to Natalie behind his back. All I was trying to do was plan a single meal or drinks with my friend on a 5 day vacation. My husband ended up sending a text to mark being more direct and clarifying the situation. Mark lost it and canceled their reservations. 

It’s been 5 months and I kept trying to make plans with Natalie. She still wanted me to be a bridesmaid and I got a dress (which she approved). We finally saw each other for the first time two weeks ago and while it was awkward at times it was still fun. A week later she sent me a text that they are no longer inviting my husband to the wedding but she still wanted me in the wedding. I was furious. The wedding is 5 weeks away. I backed out and said I’m sticking with my husband. While she was a good friend to me at times this last year she has been MIA and I was 100% going to pick my husband over her. While I appreciate she’s doing something similar by sticking with her fiance I am just so confused how she thought it was normal to not invite my SO (to a 200+ wedding). It just felt like Mark was trying to make a statement by excluding my husband. Everyone in my life is on my side but Natalie won’t stop texting me and saying how she isn’t trying to end a friendship over this but that I am being hurtful. So, am I the asshole here?",0.0,0.08497381955385208,0,1
71,1cd2bjb,AITA for getting pissed about my boyfriend constantly watching YouTube shorts?,"Okay so. I am 18F and my boyfriend is 21M. He is living with me and I’m happy about it, but there’s a big problem.

My boyfriend watches videos *constantly* without headphones. He scrolls mindlessly through YouTube shorts at all hours and it frustrates me, because he doesn’t use his Bluetooth headphones. It’s even worse when I am trying to sleep, and the sounds come sporadically.

I get overstimulated and overwhelmed very easily, especially with audio. He watches these videos all the time without his headphones, and even when he wears headphones I can hear it because he watches videos on such high volume. I have asked him to wear his headphones when we’re sitting together, but he will pout and complain. It infuriates me. 

It’s bad when he watches them at night, because the blue light from his screen as well as the blinking light on his headphones keeps me awake. I struggle to sleep at the best of times, and it’s difficult especially because I like to cuddle.

I’m fine with him doing what he wants to do, but it affects me too. He struggles with feeling like he has no control, so he tries to take his control in his own way. I just want him to stop watching these videos all the goddamn time and be a bit more understanding.

So AITA for getting mad at him for watching YouTube Shorts all the time?

72,1cd290l,AITA for refusing to talk to my best friend about her clearly toxic relationship?,"For 7 months, my best friend, (19F), has been in an off-and-on relationship with a guy who is clearly not good for her. They've only hung out in person for probably around a total of eight hours, and every single time they do he asks her to suck him off. At first, during the beginning of the relationship, I, (19F), thought this was fine because she told me they had a long discussion about what they want for their future. They both came to the conclusion they want serious, long-term relationships but also want to have fun.

Things were going fine at first before he began leading her on to get a blowjob. Any other time she asked to hang out, he was always busy. I started to get a feeling that the whole talk they had was just so he could get in her pants, and voiced my concerns when she started to get upset about their lack of communication. When I told her my thoughts, she told me that she knows him, that he's just busy, and that they talked about what they’re looking for in the relationship.

Things didn't end well, needless to say, and months later after many FT calls of her sobbing to me about this guy saying he didn't want a relationship at the moment, and me comforting her for weeks on end, the relationship seemed to die out. That was until a couple of months ago when she told me he started to snap her again and asked to be FWB. I told her that it was a bad idea, that no one who knew this guy or heard her talk about him liked him, and that he was just going to use her. She told me she'd be fine and wanted to be FWB for her, not for him. I knew that she still had feelings for him, but told myself if it was what she wanted, then it should be fine.

Soon after their situation began, I found out she was sending him nudes. I told her that he was definitely showing his friends or sending the pictures around, but she insisted that he wasn’t that kind of person and that his friends wouldn't want to see nudes as they were super religious. I once again said okay with a warning, but continued to listen to her talk about him and support her nonetheless.

A month or so after this situation started, she got upset over him again, finding out he'd been talking to other girls and commenting on their insta posts when they had said they wouldn't be seeing other people. And so it began all over again. She was super upset and called me on the phone crying over him or angry. I told her that he's not good for her and I kept saying she needed to listen to me because he was going to keep hurting her and is an awful person. 

However, just last week when I thought things were over, she claimed she's in love with him and isn't ready to let go yet and continues to meet up with him for things and send pictures. Because of this, I told her that next time he hurts her, she can't come crying to me.

I love this girl, but I can't keep listening to her cry about it when I've told her thousands of times he's bad for her.

73,1cd21u1,AITA for telling my friend we’re not comfortable with her new bf coming over to our house when she house sits for us,"My spouse and I are leaving for a 7 day vacation in two days, and my friend agreed a few months ago to house sit for us. She has house sat for us several times in the past and I wholeheartedly trust her. I will say she is very hot and cold and cycles between emotions very quickly. The first time she ever house sat I did pay her, but she said after that she didn’t want us to pay her since we are friends and it felt weird. So flash forward to now, she has been dating a man she met on a dating site for a few weeks now. They’ve known each other for about 1 month or so. She says he is a really good guy but we have not met him yet. 

A few days ago she told me “I’m probably going to have him come over if you don’t care” I told her initially that I didn’t care but I would have to talk to my husband. After talking with my husband, he doesn’t feel comfortable and raised a few very good points (we have pets and a gun in the house, plus other valuables). We trust her but obviously don’t know anything about this man. I told her yesterday that my husband didn’t feel comfortable with her boyfriend coming over to our house without us there and we would prefer for it to be just her. She got very upset, stating that she is hurt that she feels like we don’t trust her and she would never bring someone into our house that would hurt it or our pets. And that we should let her have him over, especially since we aren’t paying her and she’s doing it for free. And she was only planning on having him over for one afternoon, and they already had plans to use our fire pit and cook dinner in our kitchen. (She still lives with her mom, not sure about the boyfriend’s living situation). Me and my husband talked about it, and since we live in a new city and don’t really know anyone, and don’t think we could find a place to board all 3 pets this quickly, we agreed to letting him come over for one afternoon. This friend had a history of being very hot and cold and we were afraid if we said no she wouldn’t watch the house at all.

Well this morning I was talking with some coworkers and they were making some good points about at least finding out a few details about the man. So I texted my friend asking a few details (last name, job, what city he lives in). And I looked up his Facebook page (which I feel most women would do?) And she got very upset stating that she is “honestly over it” and “this is getting too much for me” and then went on to say she would “pass on the opportunity” to house sit.

Thankfully I have some wonderful coworkers who are going to house sit for us, but I can’t help but feel bad that I upset her.

75,1cd1y3x,AITA for not knowing my parents were planning something for my birthday?,"Some background context. My parents, but especially my mom, have a history of ruining my birthday. Breaking promises, starting arguments, you name it. I have come to dread it each year because of this.

As my birthday is this Saturday I was wondering what this year's birthday ruining event would be, and sure enough today was the day. 

Some relevant context. My brother's band has a gig on Saturday, and everyone in our family is attending. My best friend asked me if I was doing anything for my birthday, and I mentioned that in the evening this is what I was doing, so he asked if I wanted to meet up in the day to grab some food and do some good old day drinking. No one else had asked me if I wanted to do anything, so I agreed. 

Skip to today. My mom mentioned that if I wanted to stay out in the evening after the gig I would have to find my own way home. I said that was fine because I'd be taking a train into the city anyway to see my best friend, because he is the only one who asked me if I wanted to do something on my birthday. (I will totally admit, I was hinting that I wanted my family to tell me they wanted to spend time with me on my birthday.) 

My dad says to me ""you wanted a new laptop, didn't you?"" Because I have been saying for ages that I need to get myself a new one because mine is falling apart, but I'm currently saving for a big move abroad so I haven't replaced it yet. Literally, the screen falls out. How this thing still turns on is anyone's guess, but I digress. I say ""Yes, but what does that have to do with what I said?"" He says ""We were going to take you to get one for your birthday."" My mom quickly butts in and says ""It was supposed to be a surprise."" 

What I don't understand is that my parents decided to straight up tell me what they had planned instead of saying something like ""we have something planned, but it's a surprise"" to waylay my feeling of my birthday being forgotten.

My class has 7 students and we’re all very close friends except for one kid, Conner (14M). He joined our school just this year. I will admit, the second he stepped into the classroom on the first day, I had a bad feeling in my stomach, and I always trust my gut, so I might be a little biased. 

The six of us, who I’ll just refer to as “my group,” have been friends since elementary school, but we did our best to make Conner feel as welcome as possible. 

For context, our group has two trios. Conner gravitated more towards mine - he sat with us at lunch, hung with us at recess, just spent time with us. The two others in my trio are kind of innocent and don’t feel comfortable with inappropriate/sexual jokes. Although we made this clear to set boundaries, Conner still made some. He was borderline harassing myself and the other girl in my trio. Then, he crossed a line. 

One day, we were at lunch, and Conner told my guy best friend “You look like Shrek because you have the extra layers.” I didn’t hear it, but the other girl in my trio did, and she pulled me into the bathroom to talk to me about it. Once I’d heard what he did, I was fuming. 

I immediately marched up to Conner and said, “No one speaks to my friends like that. If you want to disrespect us, you can leave.” He played the victim of course, but from then on, I avoided and ignored him. 
We told the our other three friends, and they distanced themselves from Conner. 

That all happened in September. It is now April. No one likes to interact with him, including the grade below us, because along the school year, he’s done and said other hurtful things.

My friend immediately backed off and according to my friend they haven’t talked since September of last year. I told him he did the right thing by apologizing both in text and in person but the other person shouldn’t have snapped at him way they did and instead said, “I got your apology but I need some space away from you right now please.” When friend came to me for advice I said just keep his distance. Am I The Asshole though for saying for additional advice that he needs to now just stay away from the person because if his apology is going to go not acknowledged then don’t acknowledge that person again because a true person would acknowledge that he apologized and ask for space but not be so aggressive towards him.",0.0,1.029476284980774,1,0

A few years ago I met a man we will call him Jim he seemed lovely man we went on dates got together everything was normal. He had told me stories about his child being deceased from a heart condition he has ( Aortic valve stenosis) Jim has his condition as well . 


A short while being with him in the middle of the night his daughter from a previous relationship had passed on due to this condition it was heartbreaking to watch him suffer he got a phone call telling him I was asleep .for context his children was in england. I fell pregnant a while after this and we was happy… fast forward some time later we had social socials over a neighbour  asking false accusations  which made them dig up histories. 

They was fine with me but not Jim they felt there wasn’t something right! They was CORECT!!  Jim had lied about his kids being deceased, when I found this out after my daughter was born I left him there is a lot more too it with his behaviour making fake Tiners of me and the blaming me just for argument and attention and many more but that was enough for me to leave. He made several threats and harassed me for ages and my family. 

I had to jump through hoops for social after because of him and even had my kids taken for 3 months as him and his so called sister ( who pretended to be my friend through all this) made accusations anonymously about me and the kids so he could get her and they believed them. When I got my children back because Social realised it was all lies my son was okay he was just glad to be home my daughter though was clung to me she has serious attachments issues and is all about mummy.

P.S he did bring this matter to a court a few years ago and they denied him contact at that time he currently trying to bring it back up again so this is pending … also after being harassed for 2 years I tried to let him have contact through FaceTime and  let him know about her life and the next morning when I wasn’t awake by 7 am because she was unwell so we both slept in I had 60 miss calls and he rang social and made more lies as I didn’t pick  the phone when he wanted to talk to her.

My husband and I are both in our 30s, we are expecting our first child very very soon. I also have another daughter who is 8, with my ex. We were together for a few years before having our daughter, but then he met someone else and decided to leave. This was when our daughter was only two, so she doesn’t know much about what happened. 

My ex didn’t really want to very involved in our lives or co-parenting because he wanted to “start over”, anyways I didn’t want my daughter spending so much time with someone who didn’t even want to. So he got to see her a weekend a month. His new wife treats her politely and he always makes an effort to have fun with her and ask her about what happened since they last met. They are obviously not as close as ideally a dad and his kid would be, but it is alright. 

My mom was very angry about the whole deal because she told me when my ex and I were dating that she didn’t think this would end well. She was right and I fully accept that. She thought it was very unfair that her grandchild would not have a good relationship with her dad, at least the kind of relationship she would have wanted her to have. (That is a horrible sentence. Sorry.)

85,1cd0oiv,WIBTA for refusing to let my baby to sleep in my MIL’s room? ,"I’ll(30f) start with the fact that I love and adore my MiL(65f). In our culture we live with our parents-in-law after marriage and this woman has made that the most healing and rewarding experience for me. So much so that it even healed my trauma from my own nmom. 

I have lived in this house for the last 3 years and can confidently say that MIL is a decent and a respectful person and always respected my boundaries. She cares for me, cooks for me, won’t let skip meals. If my husband or I ever fight she sides with me and never ever taunts me. Gives good advice. She has taken care of my emotions more than any parent that I have had. I genuinely call her mummy and love her as much. 

But now that I have given birth, I have been living at my father’s house for the last two months(cultural thing). 


My MIL never interfered in my postpartum, always helped with chores, stayed in the hospital when we asked her and gave us space as long as needed.

Now I have moved back into my husbands family home. My MIL is super excited to spend time with her grandson. And last night she said “ can I make him sleep in my room?. I want him to be used to sleeping with his grandma too. 

She didn’t ask this, she hopefully said it, hoping to be approved by me.

I felt it as very very odd. But I said “Ofcourse”. But my husband saw my face… and understood my discomfort and politely declined the request and said that can be done some other day. 

My MIL graciously accepted his word but offers to help us with my son’s night time routine. I am perfectly fine with that

I trust this woman fully and was looking forward to letting my son be with her at home all the time even take naps with her.. But during the day…

I don’t know how to feel about this particular request though… I don’t wanna hurt her feelings..
Will I be the asshole if I refuse to let her take my baby to her room to get used to sleeping with her?


Update:

Thank you so much for all the mindful comments here. They really gave me some perspective..

So this morning my son was crying loudly and I fed him and then went to the kitchen to grab myself a banana at around 7:00 am. My MIL was there and asked me if I got any sleep at all. I said that I had to wake up many times to feed him but now I think he will need formula if he gets hungry again. My MIL asked me if she wants me to take him so that hubby and I could get a few undisturbed hours of sleep. 
So I brought him to her, went back to our bedroom and woke up at 10:30 and then my hubby and I had some sexy time and took a shower together after months of being apart. 
And I came downstairs to find my LO sleeping in his grandma’s arms. He had been fed and his diaper had been changed. And MIL was giddy with satisfaction of the morning cuddles she got with him.  I think I might start giving him to her every morning now.

If I left my kid with her alone I know that he will be given good values and I know that he will be spoken to respectfully by her. 
So yeah I think it’s just a matter of feeling it all out. 
She has done this in the past too, when my hubby and I fought she kinda forced us to go buy a few groceries knowing that it would force us to talk to each other on the way and make up😂😂
I think truly lucked out here.

So this morning my son was crying loudly and I fed him and then went to the kitchen to grab myself a banana at around 7:00 am. My MIL was there and asked me if I got any sleep at all. I said that I had to wake up many times to feed him but now I think he will need formula if he gets hungry again. My MIL asked me if she wants me to take him so that hubby and I could get a few undisturbed hours of sleep. 
So I brought him to her, went back to our bedroom and woke up at 10:30 and then my hubby and I had some sexy time and took a shower together after months of being apart. 
And I came downstairs to find my LO sleeping in his grandma’s arms. He had been fed and his diaper had been changed. And MIL was giddy with satisfaction of the morning cuddles she got with him.  I think I might start giving him to her every morning now.

If I left my kid with her alone I know that he will be given good values and I know that he will be spoken to respectfully by her. 
So yeah I think it’s just a matter of feeling it all out. 
She has done this in the past too, when my hubby and I fought she kinda forced us to go buy a few groceries knowing that it would force us to talk to each other on the way and make up😂😂
I think truly lucked out here.

My roommate (18M) and I (18M) didn't click when I first moved in. We were very independent people, he had his own friends, and I was starting to make mine. I don't know exactly when we started to become friends, it just seemed like we went from nothing to best friends overnight. We have our own small little friend group now and I love all of them dearly. However, recently, my roommate started spending a lot of time with our friends without me. I got upset and pushed him away which made him spend even more time with him. It went from things being okay to all of a sudden falling apart. Then he snapped at me over text. I went out late with a friend and he sent me probably one of the longest texts I've ever read about why I NEED to check in with him and why me going out like that wasn't okay. He's since apologized and I know he was just worried but some of what he said freaked me out. Since then though it hasn't been getting better. We started to repair our relationship once or twice but then he would disappear again. He's said nice things to me and apologized but then I don't see him, and his actions aren't changing.  He knows I'm upset because I feel left out but isn't doing anything to change that. I feel like my emotions are justified but when I told my parents about what was going on, my dad seemed to think that I was in the wrong. I know maybe I could've handled things better but it's tough going from things being picture perfect to them falling apart.

87,1cd03nr,AITAH for telling my Dad I don't care about his company after he accused me of creating a fake Twitter account in his name?,"I'm a 38m and my Dad and I have never really had what I'd call a healthy relationship. Without going too deep into family history, he was mostly an absent father due to drug use and addiction. In the rare instance he was around, he was physically/verbally abusive. Recently, the past 3 years or so, our relationship has gotten to a place where we can communicate without it leading to arguments.

I received a call this morning in an accusatory tone. Mind you, we haven't spoken in months. No pleasantries or how's everything. It started with ""let me ask you a question"". I said ok, it's 7:30 am and I'm half asleep. He asks if I have a Twitter account. I said that I do have one but I'm not an active user. I ask why he is asking me these questions. He said that his social media manager at his company (he's the CEO) mentioned that he had some other accounts listed and we share the same name so he thought it may have belonged to me. At this point I'm too tired to care and he starts feigning interest in my wife and kids. It's my Wife's birthday, which he doesn't mention. I'm not all that concerned but he did spell out the username he was worried about. We hang up.

I kept thinking back on our conversation so I looked up the account. I found the account with his picture as the profile pic and a bunch of posts purporting to be him. The account was also focused around his company and had a bunch of updates claiming to be written by him. At this point I figured out why he was actually calling and I'm really upset that I would be his first suspect as someone masquerading as him online.

I called him back to say that I thought it was really messed up that he would suspect me as the person that created this account. He disputed my findings and said his social media manager brought it to his attention but didn't mention that his pictures and posts were on there. I asked why he would call me without this information and why was it such a concern if it only had his name. A quick Google search would list many accounts sharing our name alone. He apologized but refused to admit he suspected me which I thought was unacceptable. I continued to press him about why he would believe this to be the case and he only kept apologizing. I told him if he refuses to admit that he was caught to just leave me out of it and I don't care about his company.

That made him absolutely lose it and he said I crossed the line. He also said he was a man and he wasn't going to put up with being called out by me. His voice was shaking in anger and I mention that he has always cared more about his company than his family. He kept repeating that I have so much resentment and that I can't stand being called out. I let him know that he was free to say what he'd like and I wouldn't react. He started stuttering and didn't say much of anything that made sense after this. We hung up and we probably won't speak again for a while. We've gone years without speaking before.

We are both college students (we study the same branch), + he earns 4 times more money then me. We have the same He is (at least as far as i knew) loyal, loving, and jealous man.  
2 months ago, we gave a break on us. He wanted to think. And the reason was that he wants to travel, go a theater or concert every week. But i didn’t show any extra enthusiasm for these activites. We made up after 1 week of not talking. For the first month, everything was okay and we did a lots of stuff, but the second(the last) month, we couldn’t do anything but it wasn’t because of us. We had a 9 days holiday and we both went other cities where our families live. Also we had midterms and we were busy studying.   
He has been distant for the last couple of days. I kept asking why and he kept telling me ‘ill tell you why after midterms’. The midterms are not over yet but i insisted today and he finally talked to me. He told me that he know that i'm gonna get mad but he cheated on me two times. first time was when he went back to the city where his family lives like 8 months ago. he flirted with some girl he didn't knew and kissed her on the cheek. the second was 3 weeks ago, when we both went to our hometown. he was just sitting with a 'FRIEND' and they flirted a little after talking about the her sex life(???). 

to be fair, i don't think flirting is cheating, it's just a way of refreshing confidence. but the deal is, he thinks that this is cheating. so there is 2 things i'm mad at: he did something that he thinks is 'cheating', and he kissed another girl.

so after this talk, i told him that i need to think about it but it's not the time since we have another midterm together and we need to study. so we studied with couple of friends and i left early since i was a little dizzy. but i couldn't manage to leave school because the dizziness went so bad that i couldn't walk straight so i sat somewhere in the school. it turns out that he decided to leave just a couple minutes later than me and he saw me sitting. i told him i was fine but after insisting a little, i explained my situation to him. he told me that he wants to walk me home. after 2 minutes of walking, i stopped and asked, 'why do you even want to walk me home?' and he told me that because i am dizzy but if i want to walk alone, he would let me walk alone. after a couple seconds of silence, i looked straight to his eyes, and told him 'i want to walk alone.'. 

the look on this face was inexplicable. he was in pain, sad, just about the cry.

89,1cczw6e,AITA for threatening to take my ‘best friend’ to court,"I (23 F) have been living with my roommate/best friend (21 F) for over a year. Things were good until she started dating a new guy. He was nice at the start, but then began staying over 3-4 days out of the week and bringing his dog (5 year old pitbull) with him for the duration of his stays. I’m a big animal lover and have a cat, but his dog was tough to live with. We have a small apartment and he is a big guy, and he can be very aggressive (the boyfriend said he has bit people before). He also was not potty trained and would pee EVERYWHERE. He did not clean up after him, and after about 2 months of him basically living here, the place began to reek of dog pee. I started gently throwing out solutions to help, which were always met with excuses of why it wouldn’t work. 
Well, out of the blue last week, she texts me and my other roommate (26 F) that she is moving out with her boyfriend and we needed to find a replacement for her on the lease. We asked to have a roommate meeting to clarify things and get some details hammered out which she reluctantly agreed to. We were kind in our approach so she wouldn’t feel attacked, and asked if she could get the carpets cleaned before leaving as it would be hard to sell the room to someone when the place smelled of dog pee. We also told her we hadn’t had any luck finding anyone on such short notice to move in in less than 2 weeks, but had someone who could move in June 1st. We told her she would be responsible still for Mays rent, because that’s how a contract works. She said no to all of this. 
This, however, was not my final straw. My final straw came this weekend, when she moved out the majority of her things and in the process, stole several of my possessions, including a set of vintage glass goblets I had inherited from my grandmother who basically raised me when she passed away, and broke some of my things. So, yesterday I sent her a text saying that I had tried to be kind and civil and I had let a lot of things slide in the past but now if she was going to be evil I would be too. I sent her screenshots of the lease where it said no guests could bring animals, as well as where it said guests couldn’t stay more than 5 nights within a quarter year without being on the lease. I told her if my things weren’t returned I would take her to court for all of this as well as her unpaid rent and my stolen items. 
She did not reply, instead her boyfriend snap chatted me that I needed to ‘grow up’ and that i wouldn’t be getting my stuff back, and then blocked me so I couldn’t reply.

Of his own free will, he went more in-depth given the situation was a bit complicated and sudden.

Fast forward to four days ago, we got into an argument, but it wasn't anything I thought couldn't be resolved. We didn't talk much the next day until he suddenly sent in a ""Heyy"" at 10 pm.

I'm not proud of it, but what was I supposed to do at that moment? Eventually, he got ""fed up"" and started playing the victim, saying that I was wrong for calling him emotionally dumb knowing how he struggles and given he meant well. Also, he doesn't have any sort of neuro-divergency, at least not anything diagnosed by the psychiatrist he saw after his mother passed. I decided to just ignore him.

93,1cczcvq,AITA for not wanting to give emotional support to my mom?,"(English is not my first language, I'm sorry in advance)

I'm F, 21, and since I was a child I've been serving as emotional support for my mom, every single time she had a minor inconvenience in her life. She used to call me the ""peacemaker"" of the family. I've got a slightly older brother, who is not very close to her since they argue 65% of the time. and a father, who died 4 years ago. Ever since my father died, I became the only source of happiness for my mom. She has no friends and has no interest in finding love again.

 She used to work a lot, after my dad passed away, so our family did not get into financial difficulties, which I am very grateful for, but I also helped her in every way I could, I worked hard and studied hard. Since I spent all my time wanting to help her, I did not have time to make close friends or get a boyfriend, my only worries were to get good grades, get into a free university, do all the housework and cooking, and work hard. 

But now my mom complains to me all the time about me not having a boyfriend, she even questioned if I was lesbian (which I don't take any offense in, but she is VERY conservative), and she worries about my future and me all the time, and every single day she has anxiety episodes where she will say her entire source of anxiety is my future. She did a bariatric surgery and her emotional state is even worse. now. And, since I'm taking care of her the entire day and night, it's been unbearable to handle her numerous mental breakdowns because of these worries that she has.

 I'm doing the best I can, I've never been a trouble-child and always did my best to be well-behaved, but it's been some years since I've been under that pressure, and that mental burden is making me way less productive, revenge procrastinate, and depressed. Since we're having to spend way more time together, every single little thing I forget to do (like washing one plate) has been a reason for us to fight. Every single time she calls me to her room to lay down on her bed and ""talk about life"" (which ends up being the same complaints about me), I simply refuse to go and I really don't want to talk to her about her emotional state. I'm very burnt out and I'm struggling with my own mental health already.

I've tried everything to help her with therapists, and psychiatrists, but she has a lot of stigmas about getting mental help from a professional and refuses to see one online or face to face. AITA for refusing to listen or help her by myself with her own problems?

94,1cczb1d,AITA to be angry with a friend for applying for jobs against me?,"AITA for being aggravated with a friend? Im not sure where to go with my friend from here or if I'm wrong to be irked.

I've been unemployed since August. I get nothing but ghosted and run around by potential employers. One company keeps posting and reposting jobs. I've applied repeatedly for 2 jobs with them, 5 times since February. They won't even give me a ""we're going with other candidates fuck off"" email. Ive emailed them directly, messaged through indeed and called them. Nadda. 

This evening, we went out for trivia. The very first thing my friend tells me is about her application/interview with this same company I've been applying and applying to. She hadn't mentioned applying there, I know I've mentioned applying there to her. She has a job and would be taking a small pay cut for the position with the company.  This is the 2nd job I know of that we both applied for. 

I feel betrayed and angry. She knows I'm struggling in this job market, but she makes it even worse by applying to the same jobs when she doesn't need it. 

To make it worse, she sends me links/screenshots of jobs like janitorial and entry retail or fast food. We worked at The same place when we met. When she was promoted, I took on most of her old duties. She is more qualified for these jobs, but not by a huge amount. I feel like she's saying all I'm qualified for is fast food. 

Am I justified in being upset with her or am I over reacting? What would you do?

Update: she didn't get the job because of her availability on weekends. That requirement was listed in the job ad. 

I take the asshole ruling however, my bf was with us when she dropped her news. I left to go outside since i was upset and trying to keep it to myself. My bf apparently told her it was a pretty shitty move to announce it like that. He told her i'd been applying for that job, and she just had to rub my nose in it. 

I guess this is the wrong place since I was mostly looking for advice, not to be scolded for reapplying to one of the few jobs in my area I'm qualified for.

Quick recap on everything. I (18M) am friends with a Claire(not her name, 18). She dated a guy for two years, broke yup, started flirting for two months with another, didn't work out. This might seem unnecessary but it is important.

Last Monday we were all hanging out with our group of friends and she got a text that the guy she was flirting with was there as well. She, beforehand, told me in private that two guys were hitting on her, but she didn't want anything because she was looking to score a goal with the other. Let's call one of the guys that was hitting on her Mark.

She came back a couple hours later, pretty angry and sad because the guy was clearly flirting with her, to a stupid degree, and when she reciprocated he got cold feet. 

Anyways, she started to get pretty close to Mark. It was more the other way around, but ok. My friends and I noticed that in the following days, she was pretty close to Mark as she once was with the other guy. Some of us felt that she should be just a bit careful.

Before that, I was talking to her, trying to support and confort her in whatever ways possible. I do not have feelings for her, I was just a Friend trying to help her out. 

Two days ago I noticed that it was as if they were in a situationship similar to the last one she had, and some friends just told her to be careful and not to get carried away. I later that day wrote the next message ""Hey, just wanted to say that I noticed that this guy was getting pretty close to you, yo know what I mean. The rest of the group also noticed. Just rememnyhe was hitting on you pretty hard the other day, be careful""

I thought nothing of it until yesterday that she said she had to speak with me about the message. We spoke today and she told me that she was very upset about what I said because she felt that we thought she couldn't live without a man, and that her pretty angry at me. She wanted to talk to me first before taking it to the group chat. 

I told her that I wasn't trying to be degrading in any way, rather I was trying to help. Age told me that they were just friends and played a lot of games together, which got them close in the end. I have nothing against that, and I told her so. I also explained to her what we saw, which is what I told you before. O said that I was extremely sorry for making feeling her that way, and she said that the both of us got the wrong thing for misunderstanding situations, and forgave me.

98,1ccyhoo,WIBTA for wanting to drop a friend of 16 years while she's sick? Need objective opinions,"**\[Long post, TLDR below\]**  
I (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been close since grade 2, but our friendship has strained due to communication issues.  
Throughout our friendship, Kylie has exhibited a pattern of disappearing for extended periods. In uni, there was a major falling out where she actively avoided me and our other friends, Sylvie and Sabrina. After a few months, she apologized and admitted to lacking communication and effort.   


However, this pattern continued with her missing another planned hangout and leaving me waiting outside for hours and later not offering any explanation for it. Fast forward, a few months, Sabrina, a friend of ours has us have a sit-down and we patch up after she apologizes. Before this, she ghosted another mutual close friend in the group, Sylvie.  
Presently, Kylie lives in another country. This has further strained communication. She has minimized contact with Sylvie and Sabrina, causing tension within the friend group. Despite this, I have continued to speak with her. However, she has missed several calls we arranged, including the group calls she set up. When questioned about these missed calls, her excuses included ""I don't have anything to say"" and ""I forget. Besides, I talk to you. You're my adhesive to them"".  
A fortnight ago I texted Kylie regarding my situation of family abuse. Her response was a single text: das not good; with a SpongeBob emoji and the letters ""trauma"". She then let me know she was sick (bleeding for over a month now) and I asked her if she got tests done, etc. She set up a call over the weekend but again, didn't show up or text about it.  
Worried about her well-being, I eventually contacted her boyfriend (whom I don't know well) 2 days ago, to confirm she was alright. He confirmed she was a bit erratic but functional (eating, sleeping, working). Today Kylie texted me with a generic text: ""Hey, how you? I'm sorry I disappeared for so long. Also, thank you for checking on me with bf. I hope I didn't make you too angry/ worried.""  


We had talks a few months ago about me going to her country and I've been saving up. It feels like I am again going the extra mile to get the ""present"" version of her.   
I've repeatedly spoken to Kylie about communication issues, hoping for improvement. However, her apologies have yet to translate into consistent effort. I'm now questioning whether to end the friendship. While I value our 16-year history, I'm emotionally drained from the constant one-sided effort and feeling disrespected by her behavior towards both me and our other friends.

I started cutting hair for my friends in my teens, mostly my black and biracial friends who didn't trust anyone to cut and style it right bcs there are no black barbers local.

These days as a bit of a gig on the side I cut, style and colour friends hair. I do not charge that much at all, just for my time and it's a bit more if they want a dye bcs I charge for the cost of that as well. it used to be free just for mates and stuff but all my friends starting telling their friends about it and now I'm booked weeks in advance so I charge like £5/£10 a cut and maybe £16/£20 if I dye it as well so definitely not salon level prices. Mostly the people who get their hair cut by me are black or biracial or middle Eastern or have thick curly hair, which the shops near me are notoriously bad at cutting.

104,1ccwql9,AITA for refusing to go wedding dress shopping with my sister?,"So my sister Hannah (27f) and I (25f) aren't close and yet she invited me wedding dress shopping with her. She says she wants this to be the start of a better relationship between us and she wants me by her side for this process because she trusts me. I don't want to go with her. Even with a slightly better relationship shopping for any clothes is a very hard no for me with her. So I told her I appreciated her wanting us to be closer but I didn't feel like I should go wedding dress shopping with her. She asked me why exactly, she told me this was her extending the olive branch and trying to fix the issues in our relationship.

I told her our history, which includes recent history of as early as 3 months ago, is not good when it comes to her and me and appearance. When we were kids I was bigger. It happened very suddenly while I was still very young and my parents were concerned but doctors dismissed it as bad eating habits and not doing enough exercise. I was very self-conscious and my sister mocked me for it a lot. Our parents were furious when she'd open her mouth about it. She called me gross and even took some of my clothes to show off how humongous I was. She'd use the nickname others had given me ""Hallie Hippo"" and was really not kind about it. She made it even harder to be like that. Her relationship with our parents was super bad for years because of it.

I was 20 when I finally got a doctor to listen to me and explore why the sudden weight gain happened. I ended up needing surgery to remove a mass which made a huge difference to my appearance. 

And then I went in the opposite direction and my thyroid made me too skinny. Around the time this happened, Hannah gained some weight. Not a lot. She's not huge by any means. But it made her crazy jealous. She would make snide comments about being super skinny and how unfair it was that I lost all that weight without doing anything. I didn't see her often because our relationship was so bad. But the times I did she'd make me looking good sound so negative. She'd say I didn't deserve it. A couple of years ago we were both shopping with some cousins and it was just insane how angry she was at me. She called me ""the luckiest bitch in the world and you don't even like it"" because I was so tiny. The concerns about being too small being bad for my health were waved off.

Three months ago she told me I look smaller every time she sees me and how much she hates me for it. She told me I didn't deserve it.

And now she wants me to go dress shopping with her. Which again, is why I said no. But she hated that I ""brought up the past when it's in the past"" and she told me this is the fresh start she's offering me. I can't see her not making a lot of nasty comments about dresses and me.

105,1ccw05u,AITA for not seeing my ex boyfriend’s mom in hospital after a car accident?,"On mobile

I (29f) and ex (30m) have a complicated situation, we live with each other and share a child but are not together. 

Yesterday on my way back from work, my ex called me to let me know that his mom and aunt were in a severe accident and were taken to the hospital. He asked me to take him to go see her. I agreed but one thing he asked of me was to not act petty. 
His mom and myself have kinda gone no contact, I still see her but we don’t talk.

Background:
My relationship with his mom started off ok but there were several instances where she crossed the line when my child was born in 2020 during Covid. She said she hated me and I was a bitch. we did make up and started talking, but then a few things happened between my ex (was bf), caught him talking to another girl in 2022. I tried to forgive him but couldn’t, after the hell I was put through giving birth, caught him having an emotional affair. In 2023, I was depressed and stressed out after losing my job and starting a new low paying job. During this time my ex and I were fighting non stop, where I demanded to break up with him several times. He would decline the break up because we live together, so i was trapped with him.

At my new job I met a client who I started flirting with, we were texting back and forth, I met him about 5 times but nothing more. one late night he invited me over to a movie and I lied to my “bf” about going out. he read the text from him and called me out. That’s a whole other mess, but he told his mom and she began to act distant with me. In the past I told mom on how difficult her son is, how our relationship was not healthy and I wanted to leave with our child but she begged me to stay with him because he’s “misunderstood.” When she found out about my actions, she took his side and would just thumbs up my messages, talk bad about me so I cut her off.

Back to accident:
I drove my ex  to see his mom during traffic hours, in my head I couldn’t process what just had happened I was still taking it in. Hospitals give me bad anxiety because my mom (rip) was constantly in and out of them due to her epilepsy and my experience during labor/birth. I tried distracting myself by commenting about traffic. Once we were told only one visitor at a time, he goes in I stay outside with child. Ex calls to ask if I wanted to see mom, I’m shocked. I tell him I don’t, I don’t know what to say. We haven’t talked in months. He gets very offended, in the car he repeats himself on how disappointed he is of me, that he would do it for my dad. I told him I’d bring flowers and a card the next day for her but it lead into a full blow argument on how I’m still a piece of shit for not seeing her, I was rolling eyes and scoffing. I said I needed a day to think on what I wanted to say, it wasn’t enough for him. Said I’m an asshole, piece of shit, ugly all in front of our kid.  I wasn’t a saint either but I told him to fuck off, get out of my car and that he was an asshole.

106,1ccw020,AITA for not sending my nephew home,"I am new to all of this so please bear with me. I’ve read a couple posts to see how it’s done. Will fix something if it’s not right.

I (old enough to be a curmudgeon) was surprised yesterday when my oldest nephew Joe (alias, aged 17) texted me to ask if I could come get him from school because he was not feeling well. I am on the list and can/have picked up Joe and his sisters before on occasion when needed. To my knowledge the school had already informed his mother (my sister, “Amy”) that he was unwell but she couldn’t get him for a while.

I got him and he had been getting sick through the day, even had to pull over once on the drive to my house. He crashed on my couch and slept from about 10:30 AM until 3, then took a shower and went back to sleep. At about 6 his mom called me and asked me to either drive him or have him walk home for dinner. I told her he was asleep and probably didn’t want to eat. She said she needed him home by 6:30 so she could take one of his sisters to her school event and she needed him to watch the other two girls.

I felt a little uneasy. Joe and I don’t get to see each other too often (partly my fault and I feel terribly for it) but when we do he’s always the babysitter. Not only that, his sisters (ages 12, 10, and 7) are very loud and physically clingy which I’ve gathered bothers Joe very much. I told her I didn’t think it would be a good idea for him to watch them at that time.

I told her she could bring the girls to me so I could watch them without waking him, but she said it would be too much hassle and they wouldn’t get to the event on time and she didn’t want to make extra stops. I stirred Joe and told him what was up but he went immediately back to sleep. I texted her this and asked again if she could drop off the girls. About 20 minutes later, my sister comes banging on my door. She tells Joe he needs to come home, he gets up and goes with her after thanking me but not saying much else. She said I was an AH for wasting her time and not sending him home, saying that the fact he got up and went with her meant I was exaggerating and just not wanting to bring him home myself.

A day later she is still angry with me.

There is no way that Chet is good enough for her in my opinion. I told myself I would keep my opinion on Chet to myself unless Becky asked me. The problem is, she DID ask. 

Becky told me that Chet wants to move in together, and the idea of taking their relationship to the next level is making her have second thoughts about the relationship as a whole. She asked me to give my honest opinion of Chet. I first asked her if Chet asked specifically if Becky wanted to move into HIS place or if he just suggested they move in together. The latter means he wants to take advantage of Becky’s money, and it was in fact the latter. After that, I told her my genuine opinion, starting with my thought process about them moving in together.

Becky did not take this well. She called me shallow and said I haven’t changed since college. She said Chet has so many good qualities that cannot be measured. I asked her what those qualities were, and she listed a few generic things, like buying her flowers, texting her to make sure she drinks water, etc. I told her she could easily find a successful, good-looking guy who does these things, but if she wants to move in with Chet that’s her prerogative. I said if she didn’t want my honest opinion, she shouldn’t have asked for it. She said she wanted my honest opinion but she didn’t want me to tear Chet apart. It’s been a few days since our argument and I haven’t contacted her because I want to give her time to cool off. She hasn’t contacted me which is strange for us because we normally talk every day. I’m wondering if you think I owe her an apology and if I was too harsh on her and Chet. Should I have been more gentle? Should I have focused less on looks and income? Should I have just lied?

I (m) asked my close friend (f) to prom.we have been close friends for a while and have had a good  relationship the whole way through but she was not my first option to pick for prom.

(The asking of whether or not she wanted to go with me took place over 2 months with the latest being a week ago).

 So given she had time to think eachtime and possibly change her mind but did not , i assumed her choice was sealed. These many rejections discouraged my decision into even going prom at all. However my friends have been trying to persuade me to go .Yesterday, i asked my close friend if she would be going and she said she was still on the fence…i am also still on the fence abt going. So i asked her if we do decide to go would she like to go with me? She said “yes”. And we are still to make up our minds to whether this become the case. 


Today i get a text message from my gf saying she knows im going with my close friend to prom. I say that its a possibility but may not even happen at all and we would be going as friends. She then says im a bad person and that she heard from someone else that i was going with my close friend and now looks like an idiot bc she said i would never do that to her. I then say i have done nothing wrong and that i asked her many times and got rejected..was i supposed to wait at her feet like a pet i dont get i.

112,1ccvjdn,"AITA for telling my sister she was being ""scammed""","Well, not exactly scammed but don't know how else to describe it.

I'm 25. My sister is 40 something. She is living in the US since about 10 years and everything is going well for her and my nephews. We don't really get along because of the age difference and we never actually lived together, except for when I used to visit her city as a child with our mom. Basically we have nothing in common, I have more in common with my first nephew. I'm still living with our mom in out country (Venezuela)

So, as many Venezuelan immigrants she sometimes helps my mom with something, mostly groceries, and there are a few businesses for just that, selling packages of groceries and the person living in the US pays them in dollars and they deliver it to the family member.

However, we had bad experiences with those businesses, because they are ALWAYS late, and not like, 1 hour late or something, I mean DAYS late, in some cases, they say will deliver in the morning and arrive at night, and we had spoiled or near spoiled fruit, broken cookies, smaller meat that expected, and other issues. And those packages and delivery fees are EXPENSIVE. Of course, she pays it, but my mom could by MORE and better in a nearby grocery store with just the delivery cost.

About 2 weeks my sister paid to deliver one of those packages and they were 4 DAYS LATE! According to my sister, their excuse was ""they had no electricity"" We instantly called it BS because yes, we had many power outages, those are programmed to have 4 hours of electricity, and 4 hours without, this is because this year is so dry the dam we use to have energy is DRY. But we gave it the benefit of the doubt until the delivery guy arrived. We reviewed the groceries, everything seemed fine, and we asked where they were located. They mentioned a central location near a hospital.

It was definitely BS because they don't cut the electricity near hospitals. And if they had left that area 4 full days without electricity would be a DISASTER! It was actually offensive to say that to our faces.

I said to me sister that there was no way they would have been 4 days without electricity, but she defended the business. She rather believes a bad overcharging business than us, who are actually LIVING HERE!

This became a discussion, because she started to say ""YEAH SURE, YOU JUST REPEAT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, THAT EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND FINE"" She always does this when we tell her that things are not as catastrophic as she thinks wants to start talking about the Venezuelan government.

The project is that we choose a scene to modernize from an ancient Greek epic poem, shoot it, edit it, and then submit. For anonymity, I won't be giving the specific text.

This was given to us back in February and now we have to finish it within 3 weeks. I asked my teammates what scene they'd like to choose, but they'd always say ""we have time"" or something along those lines.

I, on the other hand, am a very strict person when it comes to homeworks. So I suggested that I write the script for us, then we talk about how we'd like to continue, they refused saying ""you don't need to do it now."" In March, I notified them again and it was the same excuse, but this time, I started drafting some ideas and talked about it with some other friends instead.

So this month, when I thought the submission date was closer to the end of May, our teacher re-informed us that it was in 3 weeks. I obviously panicked and let them know that we have to write a script. I stayed up late one night and wrote it for them to review (they still haven't).

The submission date is 10th of May and I am freaking out basically. I gave them a schedule of shoots and the equipment needed, they didn't say anything but ""sounds good.""

We were supposed to meet tomorrow for the first shoot, one of them canceled. I didn't say anything bad, but I did clafiry the situation many times saying that we need proper equipment, we need a place to shoot, and I need time editing it.

114,1ccvalm,AITAH-for telling my roommates to never ask me to help them again & blocking our mutual friend.,"I edited this story for clarification and removed the backstory to it. 

Yesterday, a casual sex partner who we will call ""bi guy"" messaged me saying he wanted to hang out and fool around with me. He then said he was getting a hotel room. But messaged saying he was getting a ride to my place. 


He was going to arrive a few mins before me so I asked my roommate and her bf to hang out with him until I got home. I get home and ""bi guy"" is sitting in the driveway with some chick and tells me he will be right in. I figured he was saying goodbye so no big deal. 

Half an hour later I go looking for him and my 2 roommates (gf/bf) and bi guy and rando chick are all locked in her room. I start talking to them and jt was apparent no one is coming to open the door so I leave. I knew they were doing drugs, not having sex. 

Half an hour later bi guy messages me that he has to go to the store but  will Be right back. I told him he is there with my roommate and not me. He swears he came to see only me and will be right back and we can order food. He made it clear he was there to fool around with me.

An hour later, I go look and they are all downstairs again. I left and came back and they are all gone and are still gone 12 hours later. 

My roommate said that they gave her and her bf a ride to the store and dropped them off at her bf's friends house. (He isn't from here and they have never mentioned a friend). I know bi guy had already got a hotel room because we were supposed to go to it. I imagine that they went to the room to have privacy to do their drugs.

Here is why I am upset: bi guy explicitly messaged me to hook up, I gave him an out on 2 occasions and he said he was there to fool around with me and please don't leave. I sat upstairs for three hours feeling like an idiot.       

my roommate knew that bi guy was supposed to be coming over for sex. And instead of sending him upstairs since that was why he was supposed to be there or telling him to leave when I told her I thought it was disrespectful that she is letting him hang out down there. And she kept me locked out of her room and when I would go downstairs and ask a wuestion they would sit in silence until I came back upstairs. The kicker was when  her and her boyfriend disappeared all night long which they never do. 

She says ""well I can't make him do anything, if he wanted to come upstairs he would have."" Which is true but if the situation were reversed I would tell him you came to see her so go do that or you need to leave out of respect for her. 

Bi guy is just an asshole all around without question in my book or am I wrong ? He asked to come over for sex with me, told me he got a hotel room for us, knew I cancelled plans to hang with him, brought a chick with him, hung out with my roommmate for hours while I sat upstairs waiting, and I even told him to message me a different day but he told me to wait for him because he was there to be with me but then just leaves with my roommate and her bf. 

Sorry this is so long. I told my roommate and her boyfriend to never ask me for anything again. I give them rides since they don't have a car, I let them borrow money, give them food etc since they don't really work. I told them all of that stops as a result of their actions. There are six people living in this house and her and I have had conversations about people coming to hang with one person and ended up with another need to be told to leave because it's disrespectful and she does that exact thing.

He asked to come over for sex with me, told me he got a hotel room for us, knew I cancelled plans to hang with him, brought a chick with him, hung out with my roommmate for hours while I sat upstairs waiting, and I even told him to message me a different day but he told me to wait for him because he was there to be with me but then just leaves with my roommate and her bf. 

Sorry this is so long. I told my roommate and her boyfriend to never ask me for anything again. I give them rides since they don't have a car, I let them borrow money, give them food etc since they don't really work. I told them all of that stops as a result of their actions. There are six people living in this house and her and I have had conversations about people coming to hang with one person and ended up with another need to be told to leave because it's disrespectful and she does that exact thing.

115,1ccv4zo,AITA for not distracting wife's best-friend's new boyfriend?,"OK, this is a bit of a weird one, but my wife and I are still arguing over this.

We have a friend, Bertha, who has been divorced for a few years now. She’s more my wife’s friend than mine. She and her son would come over every other weekend to play with my kids (my wife and her were pregnant at the same time with our first child). She was pretty lonely and it was a nice distraction for her. My wife and her would hang out and I would play with the kids and be expected to cook for everyone. She never invited us all over to hers but would occasionally invite my wife and oldest, excluding me and our youngest because her son was an only child and wanted “alone time” with his best friend. I, obviously, would spend the day with my youngest. I was a bit annoyed about the imbalance, but it wasn’t a big deal and my wife seemed happy.

A few months ago, Bertha got a new boyfriend, Steve. He’s nice enough, polite and really seems to be keen on her. I’ve tried to engage him in conversation or in some activity but he only wants to sit with his new girlfriend, Bertha. The last couple of times they’ve been over we’ve sat in the garden and they’ve spent most of the time touching each other up. The last time, after sitting with them for a while, I left my wife with them and played with the kids.

My wife has been very upset with me and said I should help her out and distract Steve more. I told her that I tried and he’s only interested in Bertha. She insisted that next time I try harder because she misses talking to her friend. I said that it wasn’t my job to a be a dancing monkey. I said that I’ve cooked for them and babysat for them for years with no reciprocation and that I wasn’t interested in babysitting her boyfriend as well, especially when he’s not interested. I said that if Bertha wanted so spend time alone with her, then she wouldn’t bring Steve everywhere they go and it’s not my responsibility for me to stop him touching her all the time. If she doesn’t like it she should bring it up. If Bertha doesn’t like it then she would stop it, but she has not.

Somehow this has turned into something that is my problem and my fault. Honestly, I wouldn’t care if Bertha didn’t visit for a few weeks. I think she and Steve are excited about their new relationship and will probably calm down in a month or two. My wife thinks I should ‘try harder’ with Steve, but he’s like Michael Scott in The Office when he was dating Holly. I told her to wait a while but she somehow thinks I can solve this. I don’t see how I can. I don’t even think there is a problem to solve but my wife thinks I’m being an asshole for not trying anymore. I’ve already tried and I’m not going to force something with someone who is uninterested and is a bit obsessed with his new girlfriend.

116,1ccuxhv,WIBTA for kicking my friends out of my apartment?,"Sorry in advance if there’s any formatting issues. I’m tired and on mobile. For privacy sake, me is me/I, Al (24m) is my first friend and Daisy (24f) is Al’s wife. 

Anyways, I (m26) took my friends in because their previous living situation was less than ideal. The initial plan was to stay with me for a little while so they could get back on their feet. It’s been 8 months…

I also want to preface what my living situation is; there’s a house and my mother and aunt live in it. I live in a basement apartment beneath them. I pay my mom for the bills and in exchange I don’t pay a set rent. 

To make up for it, i help out with chores/helping my aunt and such, as well as giving my mom a lil extra money when budget allows. 

I should also mention the ‘room’ they’re (Al and Daisy) staying in my spare room that has no windows (which is illegal, because fire escapes are a must if you’ll be sleeping in said room (which they are). 

My mom would be criminally responsible if there were a fire and they die in that room. (Sorry, got a little morbid..) 

Anyways, our (everyone’s) living situation has not been ideal. But what really rubs me the wrong way is Al and Daisy have both been jobless most of their time staying with me (in all fairness, so have I, but that isn’t their concern.) 

And all they’ve been giving my mom in terms of quote unquote rent was just shy of 250$ a month if that. (Not each, 250$ a month COMBINED) and now Al is complaining that he and Daisy are always footing the expensive stuff; yet Daisy is blowing her nose excessively, about 5 times a day and somehow i’m expected to supply toilet paper? 

I barely go through a whole roll alone in a week. She (Daisy) uses probably at LEAST half a roll a DAY. 

I also get chewed out for not buying cat litter often enough to his liking. Even though they have a double income and 2 cats, i’m the bad guy for not always buying the expensive stuff. You won’t find anywhere to rent for 250$ a month, so it seems only fair they pick up a bulk of expenses? 

Anyways, am I wrong here?

I told my mother thinking nothing of it as he works in accounting and may have been bringing clients there for a chat. She hates stuff like this especially because my dad is overweight with lingering medical issues. She had screamed at him before for accepting our neighbor's invitation to drink. Contrary to what I expected, she didn't confront him right away.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she asks me if it's possible to track someone's phone without them knowing. I said it is and asked why. She said that she needed to track where my dad is going. I responed saying that I could track him rn using google. I pull up his phone's location, which showed the same Bar/Pub. She then proceeds to ask if I could take her there right that moment and I agree, not having a valid reason to refuse. We reach there and his bike is parked outside. We go up to the Hotel then to the Restraunt and Pub but can't find him. The only place left was the Bar and the Transporting service in the same building. We ask the security to call the administrator and she tells us the Bar was male only. She sends me to see but I reason that I won't be able to get in cus im Underage. She tries calling him and he gives the excuse he always gives that he is at ""Uncle's House"". Now Ive been hearing that all my life and never pried cus i thought he didn't know his name or something. My mum goes to ask the Transporting service if he worked there and at the same time he comes up the stair. He gestures to me asking 'where?' and I point to the direction of my mother. At this point, the gears in my head click that if i snitch the situation gonna get worse and I didn't tell my mum that he came up. We go back as security starts to get sus of us. When he returns, my mum is asleep, and I tell him that mum knows you were there but doesn't know where in the building. I go to sleep after.

Now, last Saturday, I was up studying when my mum started conversing with him. I overhear something about how he apparently hugged our maid who was crying, and she responded with 'Stop, the kid is watching'(the kid being my little sister) which prompted my mum to think he was cheating.

She got pissed and was like ""Do I act like one?""

When I was 25 I got my then girlfriend “Linda” who was 30 at that time pregnant - we had a daughter, “Cleo” and a year later we were expecting our son which is when we broke up.

3 years after breaking up Linda started dating her ex girlfriend “Sam” who at that time was like, I want to say say 18? Sam was the go between for me and Linda, Linda didn’t want to speak to me and quite frankly I felt the same. But I can admit now it wasn’t fair on Sam, Sam had this massive ideal on parenting - she’s a child psychologist now so maybe she had a point, she was soft and warm: which Linda openly admits she fed off, Linda has this habit of attaching herself to others and becoming dependent on them.

I had depression, Linda worked a lot - I can just openly admit neither of us were ready to be parents and Sam took the brunt of it.

But I guess life has its way because 20 years later at our daughters 23rd birthday me and Linda rekindled and we’ve been married for 2 years, well our daughter is pregnant and she’s been heavily relying on Sam. Linda has issue with this.

I spoke to my daughter openly and said whilst I wasn’t a good dad I’m trying to change, and if she needs Sam I’ll support her, however I am trying to change and hope to be her support system. Well, Linda has been bugging and isn’t talking to me claiming I’m trying to back out again and that she signed off rights to her and Sams children (10, 12) because that was my boundary and now I’m not supporting her boundary. I said she agreed to that before we even got back together, she didn’t ask me this before we got back together.

But I can admit now it wasn’t fair on Sam, Sam had this massive ideal on parenting - she’s a child psychologist now so maybe she had a point, she was soft and warm: which Linda openly admits she fed off, Linda has this habit of attaching herself to others and becoming dependent on them.

I had depression, Linda worked a lot - I can just openly admit neither of us were ready to be parents and Sam took the brunt of it.

But I guess life has its way because 20 years later at our daughters 23rd birthday me and Linda rekindled and we’ve been married for 2 years, well our daughter is pregnant and she’s been heavily relying on Sam. Linda has issue with this.

I spoke to my daughter openly and said whilst I wasn’t a good dad I’m trying to change, and if she needs Sam I’ll support her, however I am trying to change and hope to be her support system. Well, Linda has been bugging and isn’t talking to me claiming I’m trying to back out again and that she signed off rights to her and Sams children (10, 12) because that was my boundary and now I’m not supporting her boundary. I said she agreed to that before we even got back together, she didn’t ask me this before we got back together.

123,1ccszze,AITA for wanting family to wait for me for meetings re: inheritance?,"Unfortunately, my (36 f) father passed away at the end of March after living with a bad stage IV cancer for two years. The last couple months were really bad. The cancer spread in a way that affected his competency, so I had to act as medical power of attorney and take him into home hospice, which was awful. At the same time, his symptoms dramatically sped up right around when I was trying to do an IVF stimulation cycle, and while I was technically working full-time, I was busy from when I got up early in the morning until I went to bed late at night handling those two things. I was lucky to have an understanding boss, who was flexible with me as I was mainly checking in to make sure no fires started.

As the dust has settled, and we’ve successfully held a good memorial service, we’ve moved onto trying to get through all the legal red tape to settle his affairs and have the will executed. It’s not a complicated will, and there are only a few beneficiaries, with my aunt acting as executor. Mainly it’s just me, my aunt, and my brother involved. While my aunt is technically the executor, I think my brother has really been the person making decisions and setting up meetings. However, as they have started to really move through the process with some urgency, I’ve had to step back into work and make up for lost time. I’m now working overtime to make deadlines that I couldn’t work on earlier. We’re also starting another stimulation cycle. 

I feel really overwhelmed, and my priority is just to make sure there aren’t unpaid bills or taxes or things like that that might come back to bite us in the butt later. I’m not really that anxious to get into probate and selling assets until things lighten up for me a bit at work in mid June.

So things have started moving on without me and I guess I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for wishing people would wait for me. Because l I know that things like probate and such can take an obscenely long time so it does make sense to get it started as soon as possible and if I’m not able to do it, then someone has to. On the other hand, it feels like being involved in this process is part of the whole journey with my dad, and it feels wrong that I’m not in these conversations. I feel resentment that the reason I can’t be as involved right now is almost directly related to the fact that I was doing so much for my dad right before he passed. Many people helped my dad, but I was the most consistent, and it feels weird to watch others take on a leading role in this part of the process when they didn’t want a leading role in his caregiving.

Is this resentment completely ridiculous on my part?

Update: Thank you everyone who commented. I agree that I’m stepping out of my lane. I hope none of my responses were interpreted too strongly to be denying this or not appreciating the feedback that I got. It’s a difficult time and I’m feeling a lot of strong emotions in general. One of the things I unfortunately learned during this process is that sometimes it’s easier to feel anger or frustration than some of the other difficult emotions that you might feel in terms of grief. Fortunately, I haven’t really acted on any of these feelings, so this has been helpful for me today to make sure that I stay in my lane going forward.

Thinking about this today, and thinking about appropriate roles and such, I do think that I have been asked to do or by circumstances have ended up in being in the position of settling affairs and paying debts more than people who are not the executor would normally do. I do think that if I’m not going to be involved in this process at this moment, then I’m not going to be involved in this process, and I’m going to give back some of the assignments I’ve been given.

125,1ccskd9,AITA for leaving my friend to find her own way home?,"I (23M) am only one of two people in my circle of friends who drives, which means any event or get-together requires me to pick up people and drop them off home. I don't mind doing it but my one gripe is that for occasions like parties, it's a huge pain trying to corral all the passengers when I'm leaving; it sometimes takes 30 minutes of me repeatedly telling my friends I have to leave before they start taking me seriously and start making their way to the car. It drives me nuts because it makes me feel like I'm being taken for granted and that my time isn't important enough to be considered. 

This past Friday, I went to a house party downtown (all of my friends and I live uptown). I picked up 3 friends, my other friend who drives picked some people up and the rest made their way on their own. After I picked up the last friend and as we were on our way, I told them all that I was putting my foot down starting that night: I was leaving the party at 1, I'd give them all a 10 minute heads-up and whoever wasn't in the car by 1 on the dot would be left behind. I had to work the next day at 7 and after dropping everyone off, I wouldn't be home until 2, so I already knew I wasn't going to get much sleep but what little sleep I could get, I wanted to maximize. They all agreed to my one condition.

When we arrived, one of my friends (I'll call her Jane) who had made their way to the party on their own came up to me and asked if I could drive her home too. I wasn't thrilled since it meant I'd get home even later and she sprung it on me at the last minute, but I still had room for one more and Jane and I get along pretty well, so I said okay but made sure I told her the same thing I told my other friends: I'm leaving at 1 with or without you. She said okay. 

At 12:50, I started telling my passengers that it was almost time. My plan was going pretty well, everyone was getting their coats, saying their goodbyes and making their way to the door. Everyone except Jane. As I was putting on my shoes, I could see her still chatting with someone, drink in hand. So I walked up to her and quietly reminded her ""You have two minutes, then I'm leaving"". She gave me an annoyed look and said ""Okay, relax"" and turned back to the conversation. I left and walked to the car with everyone else. When it turned 1, I still gave her an extra minute; as much of a hardass as I was being, I still didn't want to leave anyone behind so I figured I'd give her an extra minute of grace time. Even when I started driving, I checked the rearview to see if she'd suddenly pop out (I still would have stopped at that point), but nothing. 

5 minutes later, Jane called me, asking me where I parked (this was on speakerphone since I was driving). I gave her the news and she proceeded to chew me out for the entire car to hear, calling me an AH among other things. I'm not proud of the fact that I ditched someone, but I'm also tired of being taken for granted and I gave her enough warning.

we had gone back and forth for a while as i begged her to not throw away a 6 year long friendship for someone that caused me unimaginable pain. she was upset that she couldn’t be friends with him and i at the same time. i tried explaining to her how that wouldn’t work and she had to choose. i’m not one to make people choose however it was important to me.

i had later found out after he reached out to me about the whole situation that she had asked him out, made him uncomfortable by making unsolicited sexual comments and gestures to him, talking about me behind my back, and overall trying to make him feel a specific way about her. i do believe it’s important to clarify that the relationship was toxic due to both of our unsolved issues and the need for me to be independent while he is dependent. a few other things happened between us that also caused me to spiral.

she continued to argue with me until she told me that we should not associate with each other anymore. at that point in time, i was okay with it. i realized how little she respected me and tried to completely flip the whole situation on me. however now that i look back on it, should i have let them be friends and sucked it up? AITA?

UPDATE: today while i was in a public space, she saw me. she stormed over to me and began to scream in my face. she called me horrendous names and continued to scream about how i am spreading stuff about her to friends of ours that we used to share. for context, she was trying to get with a close friend of mines, boyfriend. i told my friend as soon as possible however it turns out that she was lying about it and it never truly happened. that’s why she got in my face because the boyfriend had confronted her. i understand that i maybe shouldn’t have gotten involved but i just wanted to make sure that my friend knew. i’ve known them both for a year now and i know that he wouldn’t have done anything to ever hurt her. which is why i told them just to confirm wether it was a lie or not. i stayed calm while she was screaming and our mutual friends looked at her as if she were insane. all i responded with was “okay.” she then went on to call me a bitch. as well as other things. it was upsetting to see that however i was more angry than anything. i left the situation and i didn’t say anything about her. she had involved someone of higher authority there and victimized herself once more.

130,1ccrpqo,AITA for calling the cops to see if they had my boyfriend?,"First off, we are long distance and have been for 2.5 years; 9.5 hours apart.  We have an agreement that since he's had run ins with the cops before, he will always let me know when he gets back to his house at night and is safe (safe, as in, NOT IN JAIL!).  Anyway, last night he called and said he was going to QUICKLY ride dirt bikes with a friend.  This friend is a terrible influence, commonly offering lots of alcohol to my boyfriend, who has a hard time saying no.  

Anyway, he ALWAYS calls me when he leaves his friend's house.  Last night I got tired of waiting, so I went to bed.  I woke up at 1:30am and was shocked that I had not received a text or missed call from him.  He has to get up early everyday for work (like 4am!) so he should have been home.

I began to worry, to the point where I could not fall back asleep.  I tried calling him and did not get a response.  I started to worry that maybe my boyfriend got pulled over on the way home for drunk driving.  Before anyone comments, PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PART!  

This has happened before! It was probably a year or more ago, I could not get ahold of him and something kept saying, 'call the cops' - so I did, to learn that he had been picked up for a DUI.  So now whenever he doesn't communicate with me and I know he's been at his friends, I begin to worry that it's happening all over again.  Most people would learn from a DUI, but since the charge was reduced to ""reckless driving"", my boyfriend did not learn...

Anyway, last night I called the cops and they said they did not have him.  I started to worry that maybe he was in a dirt bike accident.  It was awful and I was honestly just worried! 

Finally this morning at 6am, he answered (he had to go into work later today instead of his usual time).  I asked why he didn't call me on his way home.  He claimed he ""forgot"", which has never happened before.  I asked what time he left his friends and he immediately got defensive: ""I don't know! Why does it matter?!  You knew I was home!""  I went on to tell him that I called the cops because I was so worried and he FLIPPED OUT.  ""You are going to quit calling the cops on me!"" is what he kept repeating over and over.  He would not let me get a word in, just kept repeating the same thing.  I said, ""Okay, then YOU are going to let me know when you leave your friend's house at night.""  Well, that did not go over well.  He said, ""I had enough alcohol to show up on a breathalyzer!  Don't call the cops anymore!""  

So he admitted to drinking too much and proceeding to operate a vehicle on a road where he is not the only driver and not calling me because he knows I can tell when he's drunk...

Today my mom (68F) really wanted to put these cat like earrings (they were the shape of a sitting cat and were silver in color, with some extra details) for the past few days after i almost lost my other set of earrings i didnt want to wear at all (forced) but after i found the lost earring i took off the other and im trying to keep my ears ""earring free"" from that moment on

Today she decided i was gonna wear them, i didnt want to wear them as, like i said, i like my ears clean, but she insisted i wear them. I told her id put them on later, she said ok (i didnt want them to put them on anyway). After a while she tried again and i said fine, and put one on, but then my mom lost the pin

While she was looking for the pin i took it off, i was just that uncomftable with it. She got up, saw that i took it off and was upset that i took it off, but i just told her i dont like earrings and i dont want to wear them. She still wants to put them on while im writing this

so AITA for refusing to wear earrings?

Edit 1: Thank you for the comments! ive read them all and replied to all i was able to

Most of you told me i should move out, which i currently cannot, but if i did i have to account for a lot of things, like a nearby dog park (i have a Maltipoo named Aki), shops nearby, a school if any of my nephews are to attend there and live with me, and a bakery, which my current place already has and i couldnt imagine myself elsewhere. Heck, i basically grew up in that house

Second thing is to get away from my controlling mother, to which i also cant, as i have to depend on her (i have a disability card, have ADHD, and some other stuff) to do stuff, like get a job, or manage my finances. If i did get away from my mom i dont have any roomates to help me around other than my sisters and some of my adult nephews

Third thing is my mom doesnt understand the word 'no' as she said to me a hour ago that she will force everything on me, to which i replied 'no thank you i do not wanna participate in this'

Last thing is that some ppl said this post made no sense, and thats because im not a native english speaker, so i dont know if i expressed myself right or wrong

133,1ccr29i,AITA for walking out when my sister was crying?,"So I (21F) woke up early this morning with a bad headache. I had a bit too much to drink last night while crying to a friend on the phone. Story for another time. Anyway. My headache wasn't major but was painful enough for me to ask my mom (73F) to turn her phone down while getting ready for work. 

When my sister woke up, she almost immediately put YouTube on the TV. I was going to ask if she could turn it down but she did so before I got the chance. So I decided to try and focus on my own thing while ignoring my headache. However, even with the TV turned down, the specific video she was watching had a lot of yelling in high pitched voices which made my head throb. So I tried my best to politely ask, ""Does it have to be this video that you watch right now?"" Thats where it started.

I was going to explain why I asked before she just groaned in frustration. I was confused then she started complaining about everyone hating the fact that she watched what she did and claimed that no one wanted her to just enjoy her free time. I tried to explain to her that that wasn't the case at all. She assumed my reasoning for mentioning anything about it was because I clearly had an issue with it. And she wasn't wrong. But it wasn't in the way she was taking it. But she wouldn't let me get a word in to let me explain myself. 

Soon enough our mother intervened and said it was too early to be arguing right now. And she wasn't wrong. It was around 7:36 in the morning. Which is half the reason I did my best to keep my voice calm and collected while talking to my sister, the other half being my head. 

While yelling at me, she managed to wake up her boyfriend (22M), who immediately expressed how annoyed he was at being woken up so early. After a bit more yelling from my sister, her boyfriend passive aggressively told her not to care about anyone else not wanting her to do what she wanted. And that it didn't matter how anyone else felt about it. But she just got more angry and was about to walk out. 

 He managed to keep her in the room but she just sat down at the desk and began crying. Both her boyfriend and my mom went over to console her. And my mother attempted to get me to come over and do the same. She asked me to speak to my sister. My sister very loudly and pointedly said she did not want to speak to me. But my mom insisted. Now here's where I may be the asshole. 


After trying to persuade me a third time, I calmly looked at her and said ""What am I supposed to say if she herself said she doesn't wanna talk to me? I can't help if she won't let me. So you two can deal with it."" After saying that I stepped out to smoke down my frustration but I couldn't help but feel bad about not staying when I'd clearly upset her. Now its just us three since my mom has gone to work. She's doing better from what I can see but the air still feels too tense for me to even think of anything to say.

You’re either really happy, really sad or really angry. B and M seemed to be doing alright when I befriended them. But every time I went out with them something seemed off. M would have an episode triggered by things like needing to be patted down by a security guard or B waving at someone on the train and subsequently asking him if he was cheating on her. One time M called me desperately asking if B was ok when he was simply getting an eye exam. I was very confused at the time and unfortunately shrugged her off a bit.

 But over time, things got worse. To the point B admitted to me he was extremely depressed with how often arguments were breaking out and how much drama was happening in his life. M frequently has depressing though however B already took these as normal when I met him which upset me greatly. If I had a girlfriend, I wouldn’t imagine her doing things like that to herself.

 But at one point I decided it was enough. B needed one day without M and he agreed with me on this sometimes. He told me he would be so much happier if he took a break from her so I took it upon myself to organise that. I asked for him to come over to my other friends house one weekend just to chill out. But he wanted to invite her and I told him no. Then the argued and I said fine you can invite her if you think YOU will be ok. He acted like I was being an asshole and I will admit that this is singling M out. There is no other explanation.

Fast forward about a month and my friend messages me asking when I was going to said country and saying that they were thinking of coming too (inviting themselves). Several weeks after that message the same airline ended up having another sale and they managed to snag themselves some tickets.

I did not have an issue with them coming along, however, a condition of them “inviting themselves” to the trip was that they were to book and pay for their own accommodation, as I had already booked my own. This was fine with them.

They managed to only save enough for in country transport and daily spending money. Feeling kinda bad for them, I ended up changing my hotel rooms to twin rooms and told them that I would cover the hotel costs so long as they paid their way for everything else, which they did.



Now to the main moral conundrum.



Between the end of last trip and March they managed to get gifted quite the sum of money. Not a massive amount, but not a small amount either.

Knowing this, when another sale came up in March to the same destination, we booked a 2 week trip in October. This time with agreement that we’d split the costs of hotels.

Up to now I’ve been witnessing them splashing their money on frivolous purchases like very expensive tech products, car mods, etc. To the point where they have next to nothing leftover for the trip itself. One would think that one would hold onto as much of that money as possible between now and the trip as they certainly would need to if their current financial situation doesn’t change.

They aren’t in the most financially stable position as they only have a casual job that before the previous trip they were working quite a few shifts for, now they don't and they don’t seem interested in picking back up shifts there.

I’ve booked twin rooms for a couple of the places we are planning on staying. I have told them that if needed I am happy to cover hotel costs again, so long as they are able to save up enough for other expenses. However, I am having my doubts that they will be able to save the money required in the time left.

I'm thinking of cancelling the hotels booked so far and rebooking for myself, giving the ultimatum that if they are able to prove that they are saving enough money, then I’ll happily rebook back to twin rooms (since I will be the one covering those costs). If they are not able to save in time and ultimately not have enough money to come, my accommodation will be at cheaper rates (since it’s booked further in advance) and I’d embark on that solo trip instead.

A christening my partner and I  didn’t even want but both our parents are insistent we do. We decided to do it at the chapel my husband and I got married in as at least some sentimental value for us to enjoy. It is a bit of a drive for us all (about three hours) so my partner and I said we would make a holiday out of it over a long weekend. The families got wind of it and decided they would as well.

139,1ccq8ww,AITA for telling my brother that I won't protect him agaisnt bullies?,"First of all, english isn´t my first language. I (17M) have a brother Pedro (16M). He had a hard time at school and then after some time, everything was fine. People started accepting him and he found his own friends. I tried to be there for him, but I am a teenager and I have my own life. 

Last year, he came out as gay/NB to our family and it was okay, I have my personal opinions about that, but it's his life and he can do whatever he wants with it. We are from a village on the countryside, people don't like anything different here, everybody knows that. 

Two weeks ago, Pedro decided to come out on social media, I told him that it was going to create a situation of him being bullied again, and that he should take off the videos about it. We had a little bit of argument and told him that I wasn't going to protect him anymore if somebody wants to beat him. He ended up taking the videos from social media. 

It was too late, the same day, my friends, on a group chat, were talking about it and how happy my parents were because they had ""a boy and a half girl"". I laughed and pretended that it wasn't a big deal, but it was for me. 

Pedro told my mom and she flipped out on me saying that I am worst than the bullies because I am family. I said that I was just being practical, if he doesn't want to get bullied, don't give a reason to people to bully him. 

I ended up grounded for 4 weeks, I had a curfew of 8pm, which is very stupid, I can't barely see my girlfriend because I have soccer practice until 7 during the week. After two weeks of this stupidity, and knowing that I am right, I decided to ask my father to talk with my mom about changing the curfew time for later or ending the ground. 

For my surprise, yesterday my dad called me saying that it as extented for 4 more weeks, in total I'll be 8 weeks grounded, and the curfew is 8pm on weekdays and 5pm in the weekend. I am so angry right now that I don't want to even see my brohter. My dad said ""if 2 weeks have passed and you don't know why you're wrong, then we need to take stronger mesures to make sure you'll get it"". I CALLED IT BULLSHIT. What that even means? All my friends agree with me, I told that to her and she said that maybe I should change my friends then. I asked my brother to ask my mother to change her mind and he said that he can't do it. 

I don't think I am not even 2% wrong here, can you please give me your opinion, am I the asshole for saying that I won't protect my brother at school?

140,1ccq43b,AITA for asking my fiancé to shave his head once a week? ,"I (27f) love my fiancé (30m) very much and am attracted to him no matter what. He doesn’t have much hair left, and I personally feel he is most physically attractive when he just shaves it all off. It makes him look younger, cleaner, and more well-groomed. I’ve expressed this to him more than once, and while he does do it, he often lets it grow out a little in between.  Often when it starts to grow out I will remind him or ask him to go shave it. 

He gets offended by this and says that I am being shallow and controlling. My response is that it makes me feel like he doesn’t care that much about his appearance when he can’t do this one thing once a week. It literally takes five minutes. 

I put a lot of effort into my appearance including makeup, hair removal, nails, etc. I do this mostly for myself but also because I enjoy looking my best for my partner. It makes me feel bad that he can’t shave his head once a week without me reminding or nagging him about it. 

From my experience it’s not all that uncommon for a woman to give her male partner some grooming tips. I truly don’t understand why he gets so offended by it. I get that relationships are about more than physical appearance, obviously. It just makes me feel happy and loved when he puts in that extra effort into looking sharp for me.

142,1ccpne6,AITA for being responsible of my manager's new nickname (Peter Pan) ?,"Hello Everyone,  
I 33M (and French), everything in that post happened in french but I'll translate everything for y'all.

Background :  
My company has two offices, one in the US and one in France. I'm the only Social Media manager / community manager / content creator for that company. It's a lot of work but I usually don't complain. When I joined the company, that role didn't exist and it's by creating things on my personal time and showing the results and number growing that the CEO decided to trust me and officially give me that title and the responsability of all the social media for her company. The way my contract was made is that it's Me, Myself and I: I have full creative control and as long as I don't F up, I have a job but if would F up, it's Game over; I pack my stuff and go look for another job. I just have to have a manager due to have the company built.

So, I switched teams and went from being at the bottom of the corporate ladder to join the ""Marketing and Communication team"". And while I have a good / friendly but still very professional relation with the CEO, I can't say the same for the relation I have with my new manager, the chief of my new department. He sees himself, the people working for him and what they do as the ""ELITE"". Everyone has one or multiple degrees, on very prestigious university and cursus (like Beaux-Arts, High Commercial Studies, ...) and he describes me as ""The rotten fruit"" since I don't have any diploma in my domain. And let's also add that He is not the most liked or popular human in our company, even from the point of view of people that are part of his inner circle.

So the issue :  
With the Olympic Games in Paris getting closer and closer, Everyone in the company works a lot more than usual, including me. For me it looks like around 40h of work (my whole weekly hours) done in 3 days, but I still work 5 or 6 days a week. I also need to change my sleep schedule so that I can work with the US and French employees daily.

Monday, we had a meeting, and several people were connected, including my manager, the CEO and other peoples. The conversation was about who should take on a new project. My manager said ""Give it to OP; he does nothing"". I didn't think for more than 0.2s before I said, ""Well, ImaginaryLand it's second star to the right and straight on till morning. But here, it's the reality, and that won't be happening. I'm already at 250% of my workload; so that's a no"" (In the French version of the Disney movie Neverland, it has been translated to something like""ImaginaryLand""). Everyone except my manager and I laughed when I said that.

Several days later, the tail of that meeting spread like wildfire in our company, and now My manager's nickname is Peter Pan.

144,1ccpdcb,WIBTA if I told my friend that her girlfriend is sus?,"I (19F) and Phoebe (20F) met when I joined my college volunteer club. She's my favorite supervisor out of the two. She's the prettiest and kindest person I've met, so I didn't think she could have bad luck when it comes to relationships.

At the start of this year, Phoebe started dating her gf (22F) who used to be a member of our club. They have been lovey-dovey all the time and other club members are all rooting for them.

But, recently, Phoebe has been quite stressed. At first, I thought it was due to our club's upcoming events. Well, apparently Phoebe has been under the impression that her gf has been thinking about someone else romantically. I wasn't sure if my friend is just overthinking or if her gf is sus.

I was sitting next to another girl, who made most of the decorations for the scrapbook, and Phoebe's gf was sitting opposite to me.

She's my favorite supervisor out of the two. She's the prettiest and kindest person I've met, so I didn't think she could have bad luck when it comes to relationships.

At the start of this year, Phoebe started dating her gf (22F) who used to be a member of our club. They have been lovey-dovey all the time and other club members are all rooting for them.

But, recently, Phoebe has been quite stressed. At first, I thought it was due to our club's upcoming events. Well, apparently Phoebe has been under the impression that her gf has been thinking about someone else romantically. I wasn't sure if my friend is just overthinking or if her gf is sus.

145,1ccp839,AITA for telling someone she needs to let someone babysit her youngest son sometimes?,"My sister Laine (30f) has two sons. Jake (6) and Luke (1). She's a single mom and the boys have two different dads and both are uninvolved. Until Luke was born a year ago Laine and Jake had their ""things"" together that mom-son time for them to just bond. Jake loved it and when it stopped after Luke was born it really hurt his feelings. Laine told him that mom-son time had to stop now that he had a brother who needed her time. But where the problem comes in is Laine has no problem sending Jake to me or to our parents or our grandparents while she spends mom-son time with Luke. A few times we have offered to babysit Luke so she can have time with Jake as well and she has always said no.

In recent weeks Laine has been complaining that Jake doesn't seem to like Luke and has shown zero interest in playing with him or interacting with him. She told me Jake refused to sit with Luke when she asked him to so she could get some photos of them and another day he waited to eat his lunch until she had Luke down for a nap even though she knew he was hungry. She told me Jake won't even touch Luke or look at him.

I asked her if she felt like it might be jealousy because Luke gets time with her alone when Jake doesn't. She said no. I told her Jake had asked for mom-son time with her and she said no. She told me because he's a big boy and Luke is a baby. I told her Jake was still her baby too and deserved her time just as much as Luke. She asked what she would do with Luke and I told her we'd offered to babysit so she could have time with Jake. Just like we do with Jake and did even when he was a baby. She told me it wasn't happening.

A few days ago she started complaining again about Jake not paying any attention to Luke and acting so resentful of him. I told her I explained how she could help with that and she ignored me. She told me I gave her no valid advice. I said I had. And she ignored it. I told her she needs to let us babysit Luke sometimes or Jake is going to continue feeling replaced and resentful and she'll push him away and never successfully get him to bond with Luke.

She told me I had no right to tell her what to do and fuck me because I'm still a kid (21) and don't need to interfere in her parenting.

So a bit of context, I have zero relationship with his mom.. as a kid she never looked to have one with me or my sisters, she was only close to my other fifteen cousins. Now that everyone is old enough with their families, they never call her or visit her—which I feel sorry for her, but that’s the people she chose to love and care for. She was a total a**hole to my dad as a kid, still as an adult, she treats him like crap and he still tries to get a good relationship with her… but I don’t like her and it doesn’t come from my heart to call her or ask about her.

Amanda or my MIL ask me to watch Amanda’s kids normally as least once a week. I am completely fine helping out once a week maybe twice, but I’m constantly being asked with little to no notice. I do an activity with Amanda and all the kids one day a week and typically ended up babysitting afterwards for an hour or two. Then I might be asked to babysit some other day every other week for about five hours. 

The problem I have is I’m not typically leaving her house until 5/5:30 and my husband starts getting ready to leave for work at 8. That means we either don’t spend any time together for me to cook dinner, clean, and start getting my kid settled for bed or we order out to spend time together. I also get stuck in situations where I tell Kelly we can go to the park and then I get texts/calls asking for me to babysit in an hour. 

Kelly contact sleeps, so after putting Amanda’s kids down for naps I start trying one for my daughter, but if another kid wakes up no nap for mine. This is also making it difficult to try and train my kid out of contact sleeping. 
It’s becoming a strain on my relationship, my finances, my parenting, and my mental health.

 I am literally losing sleep over talking to my SIL about this because I genuinely feel for her and know she needs help. I get life isn’t on a schedule, but getting little to no notice constantly makes me feel like I can’t plan to do anything or getting any time sensitive housework done such as laundry. I even got told she was working on a new work schedule and I was told she would need me to watch the kids just on one morning a week on a set day, told not asked if I could or would. 

Tomorrow will be day three of babysitting this week which is not normal due to the normal babysitter being sick. I completely understand that and will help, but don’t want this to but mistaken for something I can do all the time.

149,1ccnrrm,AITA for not standing by my bf who’s excluded from our friend’s Bachelorette party,"My bf Josh (39M) of 13 years and I (31F) have a common friend called Marie (42F) — who is actually more friend to my boyfriend than mine. 

Just to give you an idea she even made him godfather of her first child and used to call him when she was having fights with her ex for Josh to talk to her ex and help them to make peace. 

Josh also used to help them a lot when we were living in the same city and he was even buying them groceries when they were in quarantine before we moved out. 

**Anyway, Marie’s getting married in September and invited me and not him to her bachelorette party in Vegas for four days discriminating him for being a guy.**

We’re from Europe and this trip of 4 days is a 12 hours flight back and forth so the Bride at least paid for a villa and the tickets for everyone (except mine because I have points and I told her I will get it).

Josh did way more in terms of friendship to her than I ever did, but since we left the city, Marie has been ignoring us, never asking how we were doing, and she even ghosted me when I tried to reach out and organize a trip last summer for the four of us so we could get to know her new fiancé. 

Josh is feeling super salty and discriminated for not being invited because he never excluded her out of anything for being a woman. He also never excluded me from any social group because of my sex/gender and he feels this tradition is super sexist. 

**He asked me to stand by him and decline going because of her “sexist attitude” (his words not mine) but I’m really looking forward going to Vegas with them as I have never been there. And I don’t think it’s a fair request.**

Then the Bridal group was talking on WhatsApp that they needed a photographer and Josh having tons of professional gear and experience I suggested to the Bride for him to be the photographer of the trip which would allow him to join us.

Marie agreed but then the Bridal group who has another WhatsApp group without the bride in it started being against the idea because it’s a girl-only thing and they reached out to Marie to exclude Josh from the dinners and most activities except like 1 or 2. 

I thought initially since Marie was okay for Josh to be the photographer that he could come to the events and even one of the organizers did, so she bought him tickets for the shows and got him a mesh “Bride to be team”. She was very sweet and inclusive and Josh was very looking forward to it.

But nope— I received a message yesterday from another of the girls telling me she spoke to Marie and that Josh would be excluded from most stuffs except 1-2 activities.

Basically they want him just to come to take the videos and pics at the villa they rented and then be disregarded for the dinners and activities and only used when needed without even being compensated for it. He was about to pay for his own hotel room and flight. 

Josh feels terrible, disrespected, and now wants me to take a stand and decline the invitation given how Marie is treating him. AITA wanting to still go?

My mum irons almost everyday at varying times and what tends to happens is the iron will short the circuit that it’s on, being the same one connected to my pc which I’ve spent hundreds on, and despite her telling me when she’ll iron, she never does.

Is it fair of me to ask her to pay me for the parts she essentially broke, or ask at least contribute to replacing these parts? I recently started a job at maccas and the don’t pay awfully well, so it’ll be a while before I can afford it myself.

My issue is that I don't get much time off. In a year I'm lucky to get maybe 4 weeks off MAX but we rarely get to take it in one chunk, it's more like a week off here, and maybe 2 weeks off there.

We are both in our 30s and it's her nieces 21st. The theme is Gatsby pool party. I (35m) found some gold Speedos ( for those that don't know what Speedos are they're swim wear, they kind of look like body building posing trunks). The whole family is going to be there, as usual. The last time we were together was around a year ago for a wake. It wasn't the best gathering and caused a bit of tension between the wife and I so I wanted to just fit in and have a good time at the pool party.

The party was great, food was great but due to the last event I didn't eat anything and just enjoyed cocktails by the pool. Occasionally I took a dip in the pool but spent most of my time enjoying cocktails and making small chat. 

Anna was pretty keen to head home a bit early, so I finished my last cocktail and we left. As soon as we left the street she asked me ""why do you always do this to my family? Why do you do this to me?"" I asked her what she meant and she asked why I wore such tiny gold budgie smugglers that rode up too high, then paraded around walking the pool in circles making weird chit chat. She said the icing on top was that I got changed into swim robe then waited until I was near the pool to take it off exposing my gold budgie smugglers, stretching and then diving in. She then accused me of taking a Baywatch style dip in the pool while everyone was circled around it eating cake. I told her it was a pool party, they're swimmers and I was swimming? I admit the swimmers were on the small side, I bought them online and got the size wrong. I did wear a swim robe and remove it before dipping into the pool, but isn't this normal? I also stretched because I was about to swim, I just don't see how I'm a bad guy for this. She said I should have been more considerate especially since she has elderly aunts that attended and seeing me stand by the pool disrobing myself to expose small gold Speedos, stretching in weird poses and then taking a slow dip in the pool alone making eye contact with people while they're eating was too much.

I (17F) have a friend, Emma (17F). We go to an academically rigorous school and take a few dual credit college classes at our community college. I’ve always been an academically driven person and highly pride myself in my ability to study and perform well in school. Emma prides herself in the same things, however, she rarely puts in the same amount of work as I do. 

Current school work is becoming an issue. We take MATH143 and CHEM111 which are both necessary for high school graduation. She completely relies on me to remind her of due dates for every assignment in our college classes. This wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, but she always texts me asking if there is anything due that night or tomorrow. She texts me really late at night asking if I’ve done an assignment and if I’ll send the answers. She texts me to ask about the most basic and simple things that you can find in the syllabus.

So, she is just constantly telling me for things she can do on her own. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind collaborating, going 50/50, or answering a few questions, but sometimes when she is fully aware of an assignment, she’ll just not do it and fully expect me to give her all of my answers. So, I’ve begun to stop reminding her about what is due. I know that so far she has missed about half of a semester’s worth of math homework. 

Tonight, we had chemistry lab calculations, and as I’m doing 3 math assignments so that night, she is asking me how to do the chemistry. I hadn’t done it, I tell her that, and she literally doesn’t even do it. After our math zoom, I ask her if she has done it and she says no. Then, she asks if I will send it to her once I am done. At this point, I’ve sent her so much homework of mine and done so much to help her, but truly, I’m over being walked all over. I say I’ll go 50/50 (we were lab partners) and she has the audacity to say no. I do the lab by myself, and I’m confident that she will just get points deducted for lateness. She is so fucking lazy.

Even though I believe I’m fully in reason for doing all this, I still feel awful when I know that there is an important deadline or assignment due and she has no idea. I’m busy working away and she is out with her friends. I feel like a bad person, and that it would just be easier and less stressful to just give her what she wants.

He refused to refund and said I can cancel by coming in and would be subject to the standard 30 day notice period for cancelling members, saying it was policy which led to a long exchange of emails and messages. I ended up leaving a negative Google review of the gym with my opinion of the manager and his dodgy business tactics, one of the main points being that he paid a company to leave positive reviews to boost his overall star rating.

161,1cckbl0,AITA for not wanting to help after I promised?,"I (25F) promised to help my mother put up some curtains today. Beforehand, she came across some old couple counselling homework that she and my father did some decades earlier, and this led to her explaining she wanted counselling because she felt there were issues under the surface of their relationship, but my dad apparently said her issues were her own, and he was only being a tool because she was smoking while pregnant with me and he didn't like it (I'm not meaning to paint him as a saint here. He was smoking as well, and in her presence. He just found something to absolve him of all fault and responsibility and used it as an ace up his sleeve). 

I was shocked by the revelation that she had smoked while pregnant with me, and naturally had some follow up questions. I asked her 'did you just say you smoked while pregnant with me?'

Mum answered with 'it was a different time back then and we weren't as aware of the dangers. But I did cut back anyway while pregnant. I was only having about four a day.'

I was floored by her definition of a 'cut back' amount of smoking and repeated 'four a day!?' I was about to ask her for how much of the pregnancy did she smoke, but before I could, she honestly exploded and shouted in my face, 'I'm not doing this with you!!!'

I understand that she probably felt a bit defensive and guilty because now we know how bad smoking while pregnant is, but I was so upset by how she snapped at me, when I believe I was well within my rights to be shocked and have questions, that I refused to speak with her after the way she shouted at me and I walked away (she wanted to continue our conversation about the counselling, but I wasn't having it).

I honestly don't want to help her now. Not because I'm horrified by her smoking when she was pregnant with me (I'm perfectly fine, so clearly she/we were fortunate) I'm just so peeved by her reaction that I don't want to be helping her at the moment.

164,1cck0wt,AITA for wanting to be NC with my MIL,"Posting this anonymously from a throwaway for privacy reasons. I (26F) have been married to my husband (26M) for two years. We were high school sweethearts and have been together since we were 16. We have a beautiful baby (7mo M) and for the sake of our family's safety, I want to go NC with my MIL, even temporarily.
We've had spats here and there but it's never been anything too serious. We moved a few states away from where we grew up and MIL came with. She helped with the moving costs so we were extremely appreciative and open to it. After moving, my MIL met her boyfriend and in the beginning, everything seemed great. Both my husband and I were really happy for her because she left her entire life behind to move and start over and we were excited she found someone to start over with. He was over the top, but again, we were just happy for my MIL. 
We began to see his true colors as time went on, specifically his drinking problem and financial issues. We suspect he is probably using some sort of drug but we can't prove it so that's just our suspicion. In the time they've been together he's had 2 cars repossessed and been evicted from 3 apartments.
My MIL moved in with us and subsequently her boyfriend did as well. They regularly borrowed money from my husband, paid no bills, and contributed nothing towards groceries/utilities/etc, despite both of them working average decent-paying jobs. She was not making payments on her car and her boyfriend didn't have one, so my husband and I quite literally had no idea where all of their money was going. 
A few weeks ago, we received a notice from our landlord that they had 14 days to move due to it being a 2 bedroom apartment over occupancy issues. This obviously stressed out both of them and while this is happening, she loses her car. She was using a rental for a little bit but now wants to rely on us for rides everywhere. She and boyfriend moved into an apartment a few miles up the road but she works over 45 minutes away and night shift, so we'd have to take her and pick her up. They absolutely lost it when we said no.
MIL was basically claiming my husband owed her? She wasn't even really asking for help, just berating us, telling us we HAVE to help her because she's ""broke"" and can't afford to Uber or rent a car, yet her boyfriend buys a case of beer and bottle of liquor every two days.

It's been a challenging time at work lately. I'm a Hispanic guy working in a sterile compounding pharmacy, where we often listen to music to pass the time. My coworker, who's also Hispanic, and I enjoy genres like reggaeton and Dembow when we're alone, but things got tense when our female coworker expressed dislike for Dominican Dembow, saying it made her uneasy. I respected her wishes and stopped playing it, but then she started complaining about other Hispanic genres too, like salsa and banda, saying they were too loud.

What really got to me was when she singled me out for playing Spanish music, claiming it was inconsiderate because she didn't understand it. I pointed out we have other Hispanic colleagues who don’t have a problem with it and actually encourage it. I played music in Japanese in response, a language we both don’t understand, which she was fine with. It felt like she had a problem specifically with Hispanic/Latino music.

The situation escalated when she tried to backtrack, claiming her issue wasn't with the language but with the ""melodies"" in the music. I couldn't help feeling frustrated and offended by her comments, especially since I've never criticized her for speaking exclusively in Polish with another coworker.

I mentioned to her I might not want to go out one of the days because I may be tired from work, and this seemed to upset her. She said she didn’t come to not spend time with me, and that she also needed my help navigating to my house. I didn’t really see the problem since she would still have her friend around. I want to be accommodating but also don’t feel like I owe her anything since I feel like an afterthought to her. At the same time, I don’t want a friend to feel alone in a strange city.

Am I the asshole for declining to go out one of the days of her visit that wasn’t even specifically intended for me? Or should I push myself to join her because she’s my friend and I don’t want her to feel upset? ",No A-holes here,2024-04-25,"AITA for not wanting to go out? I have lived in a different city from a friend for the past 4 years. In all this time, she’s never thought or attempted to visit me, which is fine.

She would like to stay with me, which is fine by me, but I am working during 2 of the 3 days she is there since this visit wasn’t arranged specifically during my time off.

170,1ccj10a,AITA for yelling at my partner for discussing with his parents first regarding his job transfer,"Throw away account due to friends being on this sub.

Apologies for the long read.

I(f33) live with my boyfriend(m35 let's call him Mike) since 3 years, have been together since 5 years. We are Indian.

Mike and i have been having issues due to his parents. 
I don't know if I'm overacting and not understanding but his life revolves alot around his parents. 

Background:
 
He takes advice from his parents regarding everything, to the point that makes me question our relationship.
When we were looking for an apartment, we came across one that we both loved alot(after looking at 10-15 flats). 
But after speaking to his dad, Mike changed his mind. This apartment is in a posh area, has all the things we need yet when his dad told him it's a little further away from work (+10 mins only) Mike wanted to look someplace else. 
We got the agreement/lease done for the flat but this left me feeling undermined. 

While on vacation, Mike would video call his parents frequently whenever he would see something beautiful. This made me feel really lonely as other couples were clicking pics and admiring the places together. 

He calls his mother every morning and evening. 
He cosleeps with his parents when they visit or if he visits home. This is inspite of having enough rooms. He says Indians do it all the time and that he misses them so they all sleep together. 
I'm Indian too but growing up, us siblings had our own bedrooms. We never co slept unless we had nightmares. 

The incident: 

Mike's job requires him to move cities every 6 years. 
Yesterday he received an email regarding the same.
When he called me he seemed to have already made his mind to move to his home city. That's when i knew he discussed with his parents already. 
I asked him and he accepted. He also said that he rcvd the email while he was on call with his mum hence discussed with her.

This is where i would really like your opinion. 
I feel this transfer decision affects me and Mike. Hence he should've discussed with me. His parents are interfering and helicopter parents. They have been trying to get him to move back. I don't want to move to his home city for this reason. 
I feel Mike should've discussed with me first before letting his folks know. It makes me feel like he is putting them first. I feel undermined when his mother's or father's decisions/opinions change Mike's mind.
This is the reason that caused me to yell at him. I unleashed all the pent up frustration and spoke rudely regarding his parents.

Mike says that i took the focus off his transfer for which he needed advice. He says i shouldn't have yelled at him and been understanding, also as per him discussing with his parents doesn't mean they are more important.

So please could you advise if I'm the AH for yelling at Mike?

171,1ccit7j,AITA for refusing to let my best friend's girlfriend stay at our house?,"My (25M) best friend, let's call him John, has been dating his girlfriend, Sarah (24F), for about a year now. They've been having some issues lately, and Sarah has been staying at my place on and off for the past few weeks.

At first, I didn't mind. I'm close with John, and I want to support him in any way I can. But it's starting to take a toll on me. Sarah is constantly complaining about John, and she's always trying to get me to take her side. I'm also not comfortable with her being here all the time. I feel like I'm losing my own space and privacy.

I've tried talking to John about it, but he always gets defensive and says I'm overreacting. I've also tried talking to Sarah directly, but she just gets upset and says I'm not being a good friend.

Last night, Sarah came over again and asked if she could stay for a few more days. I finally snapped and told her no. I explained that I needed my own space and that I couldn't handle her constant complaining anymore.

Sarah was furious. She called me an asshole and said I was being selfish. John was also upset and said I was being unfair.

172,1ccisqu,AITA for not engaging any further? ,"My friend recently texted me about moving in with her after she's been having problems with her husband. We're friends from way back in college and have stayed pretty close into our mid thirties. I am pretty stable where I am and have declined to do so but asked about her if she's ok and offered to meet up or call if she ever wants to talk. She didn't reply to my texts. She lives almost 3 hrs away from me so it's kind of hard for me to drop everything and just drive to her home unannounced. She called me on the weekend I offered to meet, I missed it and called her the day after, she didn't reply and I went straight to voicemail. The weekend is now gone by this point, I've reached out via text and I haven't gotten a call or a text back. I really don't want to be involved any further as this is a marital problem and they need to sort things out internally, and to my knowledge as I also know him from way back, her husband is not abusive so I don't perceive any urgent concerns, just a matter of differing opinions about what they want at this stage in their life.

173,1ccimi7,AITA for telling my spouse to clean his own office?,"I am an exhausted, chronically ill woman with two children- one is homeschooled due to underfunded school district just giving up on him before his recent ADHD diagnosis. I cook, I clean, I teach, I spend time with my kids, I grocery shop- hell, I do everything except make money. 

My spouse has been laid off. Instead of doing.. anything, he is barely looking for a job and then playing video games 14ish+ hours a day, or sleeping until 3/4pm. He did mow the lawn recently, I'll give him that.

Today he asked me to clean and organize the paperwork in his office, and I finally snapped. 

I told him that while he's fucking off every day during his free time playing WoW from 10am to midnight, I'm goddamn BUSY, and I'm not giving up the little bit of child free time I have to bathe/read/relax because he's lazy. He does this false incompetence bullshit surrounding everything except work, and I'm just.. I'm tired. 

I'm tired of bringing plates to a computer desk to a man who doesn't even compliment the food or say thank you. My CHILDREN do, but he doesn't bother. And then washing those plates he leaves all over the kitchen. Fuck, I bought paper plates recently to make things easier and he even left THAT on the counter for me to clean up.
