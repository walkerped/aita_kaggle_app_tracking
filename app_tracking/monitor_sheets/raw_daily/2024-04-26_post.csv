0,1cditmf,UPDATE - WIBTAH if i ( m25 ) come clean and tell my girlfriend ( f21 ) that her parents hate me? ,"Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7ylm1HwkRx

After I posted and read the comments I decided to tell Sally when she came over the day after I made my original post, when she arrived I asked her if I could talk to her about something important and she agreed, i then told her about what happened when her parents pulled me aside to talk, some of the comments told me to lay it on her gently so I did that and made sure to tell her that I didn’t hate her parents and knew they were probably just trying to protect her. She looked sad and guilty the whole time I told her the story and all the other stuff they told me, she looked really confused and disappointed and she said she never thought they would be like that because they’ve always been nice to her and the friends she’s brought home. I told her that it might be different cause I’m her boyfriend, not her friend. We talked for a few more hours about it and she kept apologizing for her parent’s behavior and the things they said to which I kept telling her that it was alright and that it wasn’t her fault. 

She also told me that her parents might be acting that way because of her older half sister that started dating this guy a few years back and he ended up being a really bad influence on her sister, she didn’t go into too much detail but I know from what she’s told me that it was really bad and messy. Now I can kind of see where her parents were coming from that night, still doesn’t fully excuse their behavior though. 

Well after Sally went home she told me she had a long talk with her parents, surprisingly her parents didn’t deny it but they thought they were justified in what they did which annoyed Sally, she told her parents to apologize to me in person and after a bit of back and fourth they agreed and started realizing that what they did was unfair to me, so next week I’ll be seeing them and hopefully it goes better than last time. 

I also showed Sally the original post when she came back to my place the next day and she was reading all the comments and realized that her parents have really coddled her all her life which is another issue she’ll have to talk to them about soon. But anyways that’s the update, me and Sally are doing great and hopefully I can form a healthy relationship with her parents in the future.

1,1cdc2yn,AITA for yelling at my best friend after he told me he wanted my girlfriend?,"I(22M) have been friends with my best friend ""Luke""(22M) for 15 years, my girlfriend ""Luna""(21F) and I have been together for 2 years now. A couple days ago, Luke and I were hanging out at my place, we were goofing around, playing games, and suddenly Luke got a serious look on his face, he looked at me and told me that he had had a thing for Luna for a while now. I was shocked, I didn't know what to say at first, I just asked him what he meant. He explained that he had always thought Luna was beautiful, and that he had a huge crush on her before me and Luna started exclusively dating, but once I told him I liked her, he backed off. He told me the feelings were always in the back of his head, but that once I mentioned I wanted to propose to Luna soon, his feelings for her grew like a wildfire, he told me he didn't want to hurt me, but he couldn't keep lying to us and himself about it.

He said he might've even loved her, and it hurt him to see me and her together. After my initial shock wore off, the only thing I could ask him was if he was being serious, he said yes. Anger filled my body, and I began yelling at him to stay away from both me and Luna, how I couldn't believe he was saying these things, and a lot of hurtful insults about his checkered past with women. I yelled at him to leave my apartment, and he did. Later, I received numerous messages from him saying how hurt he was.

I'm normally a very docile person, but I was so angry hearing him talk about how he loved Luna. The messages stopped after a few hours, and we haven't spoken in a few days. I haven't told Luna what happened, but I'm still so angry at him. I know I should tell her, but I can't bring myself to start the conversation. I've been thinking about it now, and I really need an unbiased opinion of this situation.

So, AITA for yelling at my best friend after he told me he wanted my girlfriend?

  
Edit: A lot of you are saying YTA for my yelling, I would like to say that I don't condone violence, nor do I think it was mature of me to yell. In the moment, I was angry and wasn't thinking. I'm going to have a talk with Luna later today about this situation.

2,1cdbyzi,AITA for Not Wanting to Share My Inheritance with My Siblings?,"  
Hey everyone, I'm seeking some honest feedback on a situation that's been weighing heavily on my mind lately. Here's the deal:  
  
Recently, I inherited a significant sum of money from my grandparents. It wasn't just about the money; it also included some valuable family heirlooms and properties. Now, here's where the dilemma kicks in: my siblings are pressuring me to split the inheritance evenly with them.  
  
Here's why I'm hesitant:  
  
1. **\*\*Different life paths\*\***: While I've been diligent in my career and have made sacrifices to secure my financial stability, my siblings have taken a more leisurely approach to life. They've made choices that haven't necessarily led to financial security, and while I love them dearly, I can't help but feel like my grandparents' intention was to reward responsibility and hard work.  
  
2. **\*\*Family dynamics\*\***: There's always been some tension within our family, and money has often been a point of contention. I fear that dividing the inheritance equally would only exacerbate these tensions and potentially lead to irreparable damage to our relationships.  
  
3. **\*\*It's my inheritance\*\***: This might sound selfish, but I can't shake the feeling that this inheritance is rightfully mine. My grandparents chose to leave it to me, perhaps recognizing the effort I've put into building my life. Shouldn't I have the autonomy to decide what to do with it?  
  
However, I do understand where my siblings are coming from. They see this as a shared family legacy and believe that dividing it equally would be fair. But is it really fair when our life circumstances and efforts have been vastly different?  
  
So,  I turn to you: Am I the jerk for wanting to keep the inheritance to myself? Should I consider splitting it with my siblings despite my reservations? Or am I justified in wanting to preserve what my grandparents left specifically for me? Your insights are much appreciated.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"AITA for Not Wanting to Share My Inheritance with My Siblings?

3,1cdbtam,AITA for not traveling 200 miles to make up with a friend,"this all takes place about 4 months ago when me(19m) and my closest friend(19m) got into an argument. we were both drunk and I had just gotten out of a break up so I was in a bad mental place, and he was spending the night at his crush's place in uni. while staying at his crushes he messages me complaining that the alcohol was making him angry over the fact that he didn't have a chance of getting with her. this was mostly due to the fact that he never made a move and practically refused to believe he would have to put any effort into getting her but that instead she would just come to him one day.  
  
I had made it clear that I was not in the right head space to give advice out and had come off all social medias expect for WhatsApp so my friend could msg me because I knew he struggled to be alone and I was his only friend at the time. yet he would still come to me asking for advice and would get mad that my out look was depressing.  
  
during this conversation as I was trying to calm him down, he brought up the fact that I've became bad at helping him and that he had replace me with a girl who had lead him on for 2 years before hand, who I also had to get out of his life on his request.  
  
eventually he went from saying I was depressing to just attacking me about my insecurities. he would say stuff like my dad is right I'm just a parasite that wouldn't amount to anything other then being a drug addict (I have a history with weed which he had seen me battle before and at the time was relapsing mostly due to the break up).  
  
at this point I got fed up and started to argue back saying thing I knew would get under his skin, which I admit I shouldn't have done but u have to understand that I was drunk and fed up of the attack I was receiving.  
  
after some time he blocks me and I don't hear from him for a couple weeks. until one of our mutual friends calls me and gives the phone to my friend. he says his still pissed but is willing to talk it through and that he expects me to show up at his uni 200 miles away to apologise.  
  
at this point I'm fed up that he was willing to risk throwing away a 7 year long friendship over a drunken argument that we both should have just apologised in the morning and hugged it out whenever we both saw each other. but instead he decided to block me and all our friends and refuse to talk to any of us.  
  
about a month after this phone call the mutual friend messages me again asking when I will go down to apologise to him. I tell him I'm to busy to see him as I now have a job and would meet him whenever he's back in our home town where we both tend to be in at the same time. I don't get a response and get blocked by the mutual friend.

5,1cdb8yo,AITA for not wanting to hang out with my boyfriend,"I 25F have been with my 25M boyfriend for about 6 years now. When we first stated dating, I lived with my parents and was a part time student and worked part time and he was a full time student + part time worker. We used to hang out a lot because we both had a lot of free time. As of last year, I had some problems at home and had to move out of my parents home and drop out of school. With living on my own, I’ve had to work more to feen for myself. I work about 50-55 hours a week with my regular full time job + side jobs right after which includes translating/waitressing/delivery services, whichever I get called in to do. I feel super tired by the end of the day.  My boyfriend ended up graduating college and is now pursuing higher education, while im still trying to make my own living work which I have but I also want to pursue higher education but fear getting into debt and not being able to finish. A lot of times after work, I am exhausted and just want to relax at home. However my boyfriend barely works, he works maybe half of what I work. He gets frustrated with me for being so tired so I get angry and sad. I don’t have the luxury of my parents being able to pay for my schooling and caring for me at home since I now do everything on my own. So there are days I do not want to see him, I very much love my home and my space and not having anyone tell me what to do or asking me for things. When I hang out at his house I absolutely hate it because his family is there. They are all loud and messy and the home is always hot or smells because of their pets in the house. I enjoy being in my own home that I pay for. When I told him I prefer to be at my house he told me it wasn’t fair that we always hang out at my house and not at his. I do not want him living with me either because he does not work a full time job and is going to school again which means he does not intend on finding a job. I don’t want to hang out with him because I feel like we are not seeing each other at the time level. He tells me how things used to be but I cannot control what “things used to be” when I lived with my parents and could easily just hang with him whenever. I don’t know.

A week later I was told that I had to do the roller coaster because we could not work on it in 7th hour(my study hall period and a class that he did not need to be in he also did not have any other homework) So I took it home and but my dog completely destroyed it so I had to remake it a day before it was due. I made it but when I got to school the tape came off so I had to fix it at school when I was trying to fix it Trey kept saying I should change it and change where the drop shoot was so I was doing that and then one of my classmates that I was being controlling and saying some other stuff so I left the room for a little bit to cool off. Then I came back and Trey was fixing the support which was not broken and did not need to be messed with it was fine and I asked him if he wanted to put the drop shoot on and he said no. So the next hour I completely did the roller coaster. Then Trey made the poster and I lost it on accident so I apologize to him and said that I can make a new one because I lost it and it's my fault so I made a new one and then he wrote on it something that wasn't legible I could not read it and other classmates couldn't read it and this is supposed be a majority vote on your poster so I remade it and he called me an a-hole and said that I wouldn't let him do anything I said that he could make the posters as long as it was legible but he got mad.

I made it but when I got to school the tape came off so I had to fix it at school when I was trying to fix it Trey kept saying I should change it and change where the drop shoot was so I was doing that and then one of my classmates that I was being controlling and saying some other stuff so I left the room for a little bit to cool off. Then I came back and Trey was fixing the support which was not broken and did not need to be messed with it was fine and I asked him if he wanted to put the drop shoot on and he said no. So the next hour I completely did the roller coaster. Then Trey made the poster and I lost it on accident so I apologize to him and said that I can make a new one because I lost it and it's my fault so I made a new one and then he wrote on it something that wasn't legible I could not read it and other classmates couldn't read it and this is supposed be a majority vote on your poster so I remade it and he called me an a-hole and said that I wouldn't let him do anything I said that he could make the posters as long as it was legible but he got mad. Am I the a-hole? Also he had not asked if he could help with the coaster at all he just let me do it and take over and I already did most of the paper and he wrote nothing.,0.0,0.1243075,0,1

10,1cdans1,AITA for giving my dog a bigger bite than my girlfriend’s dog? ,"Gf and I have been together for 8 months. We don’t live together but we usually do dinner at either my place or hers a couple of times a week. We are dog lovers and both of our dogs get along great. Whenever we visit each other, the other person always brings their dog.

So anyway, dinner tonight was at gf’s place and we decided to order some pho for takeout. As we were assembling our food, I gave one bite of beef brisket to my dog (Henry) and one bite of beef brisket to her dog (Squirt). Henry is a black lab and Squirt is a corgi. Since Henry is much larger, I gave him a larger bite of beef.

My girlfriend saw this and got upset that I didn’t give Squirt the same size of bite. I explained to her that since Henry is the larger dog, I feel that it makes sense for him to have a larger treat. She was super pissed and said that Squirt doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t get a big bite, and that it wasn’t fair.

I calmly tried to explain my reasoning again but she just didn’t agree. She called me an asshole and said I was not treating the dogs equally. I offered to give Squirt and Henry both another equal sized bite but it didn’t really help the situation. She said it was the principle of it and the fact that I didn’t think giving them different sized bites was wrong, made her question my character.

To me this feels like a really small thing to get upset about, but it’s been a couple hours since Henry and I have gone home. I texted her goodnight and she didn’t respond.

11,1cdamq9,AITA For hoping my girlfriend would help me out around the house more while I am at work?,"This is going to be a long one. My girlfriend (19f) and I (20m) had a stupid argument. I wanted to come on here about and some opinions, because it’s getting really hard for me to understand her side sometimes. 
I just got a new job, a management job, where I’m working 12 hour days 5 days a week including a 6th day on Saturdays (halfday). It’s stressful, and long. So I usually come home very tired.

Today I came home with the kitchen a mess, trash everywhere, sticky counters, a sink full of dishes and zero dinner. I’m not really into the old fashioned ways of “woman has to take care of the household” especially if they work (she does not work by the way, she hates working). I think it should be split evenly or atleast fairly, it’s not like I never clean. I do it on the weekends when I have off. I get home, she is on her phone and does not greet me like normal. It kind of made me feel the wrong way, but that’s besides the point. I said “so there’s nothing cooked? Did you eat today babe?” In which she doesn’t respond and ignores me. I can tell it made her mad, so I just dropped it and went in the kitchen to clean up her mess, and start doing the dishes.

It’s 9pm, I have to get up at 7am, and I am a full time college student. I have finals I need to complete before this weekend and I really needed to start. Later she comes in the kitchen and it all seems fine. I bring up how I wish she would’ve helped me a little more. She says that it’s my responsibility. I say I worked a long day and have a lot of work to do, and that she was home all day. She apparently was “at the pool for only 2 hours” and “busy getting her nails done”. I said I just think out of respect and love for your partner, you’d understand my situation and try and help out a bit more. Just for the week, and on the weekends I can help clean more. She repeats herself on how she needs a day off (from being home all day) and that if I didn’t have her I would have to do it all myself. 
She then proceeds to say that since I did not pay for her nails, and that I do not buy her jewelry or other things she has no “responsibility” to clean or help me out. Because she isn’t my “maid”. Even though she knows I struggled a lot since I met her moving between jobs and I haven’t been able to buy her as many things. I still try my best to surprise her now and then, or atleast go out once a week on a dinner date. But she said that without something in return, it makes no sense for her to be “obligated” to help. I told her it was not an obligation, I just would have appreciated help.

We ended up just yelling at each other. It got heated and I ended up calling her a no-no word. I ended up having coffee thrown all over me, the walls and floor. Which I cleaned because she left. Now I am sitting here wondering if I am the asshole for approaching it like that. Of course I should have not called her a name. Definitely an asshole for that. But anyways.

12,1cdam3b,AITA for expecting my friend to apologize after she forgot my birthday?,"I (f) celebrated my 27th birthday last week. This story is about one particular friend, let's call her Ashley (f27). As some background, Ashley and I have known each other for about 6 months after we met at a mutual friend's Halloween party. We were especially close the first three months we knew each other, texting every day and meeting up 1-2x/week, but ever since I moved out of the country in early February, our friendship has settled a bit, messaging over discord about once a week and playing video games together every now and then. At some point, I mentioned to her when my birthday is, but we didn't talk about it extensively and I never really reminded her about it.

Come this past week, she forgot my birthday. This is understandable, as I didn't remind her, but I still felt hurt. She was not the only one of my friends who didn't remember, and I was feeling both very alone and like I am just a friend of convenience to many of my friends back home. I texted her to inform her that my birthday was that day, and this ensued a brief conversation where she said happy birthday and that she wished I had told her.

She followed up a few days later, noting that the conversation was tense. I stated that I wished she would apologize for forgetting my birthday. To me, I have always understood there to be an unspoken societal standard that friends will always remember each other's birthdays, even without prompt or reminders, in the same way that I would expect a partner to remember an anniversary, even without prompts or reminders. For this reason, I have many of my friends birthdays memorized and always go out of my way to remember. I am learning that this is not the standard for everyone.

Thus ensued a very long and intense conversation, with her saying that she should not apologize for an expectation she didn't know about, and me saying that the kind thing to do when you hurt someone is to apologize, even if the hurt was unintentional. I was very clear that the fact she is refusing to apologize is even more hurtful to me than the fact that she forgot my birthday, because by refusing to apologize, she is sending me the message ""I don't care if I hurt you as long as it wasn't intentional."" In my mind, if I hurt someone unintentionally or not, the kind response is to always apologize. Because apologizing tells the other person that you care about their feelings. 

The conversation ended with her saying she would never apologize, and me saying that she has broken my trust and I cannot trust her with my feelings anymore. I just no longer feel comfortable opening up to someone who would not feel any level of remorse after learning they hurt me.

On reflection, I am worried I'm overreacting. That I should not have felt hurt, and that I should just let go of the fact that she will never apologize for hurting me. That I should not expect an apology. Should I just let it go? AITA?


Update: I get it, I'm the asshole. I am being unreasonable, and I will apologize to my friend tomorrow. Also, news flash, just because I acted like an asshole one time does not give strangers on the internet the right to call me names and bully me. I am very open to hearing good faith criticisms that address my actions, not intentionally mean comments looking to tear me down. Thanks for listening. 👍🏻

Extra update: I apologized, and she was very forgiving. She even offered to write me a poem as a birthday present. Some of you commenters could really take a lesson from her!

14,1cdaako,AITA for Asking Someone Who Took My Phone To Bring It Back,"My phone goes missing at a grocery store, not sure how it ended up happening initially because I was listening to an audio book. I bike to the store and carry my groceries home in my backpack. I also stash my phone in my backpack so it doesn't fall out of my pocket while I'm riding. Again, not sure what happened but apparently some very old man who has lost his phone found mine ( either I had dropped it, it had fallen out of the cart, left it somewhere because I am the stupid ADHD brain ) and I guess assumed it was his? Not sure.

I spend a good ten minutes looking for it but I can still hear my audio book so I'm convinced it's nearby. Then the connect goes dead and I resign myself to the fact that I'm going to have to buy a new phone because someone might have stolen it. Then an idea!

I ask one of the employees working the parking lot to call my number, maybe I'll hear it ( and I wish I had this idea earlier ). No dice for five minutes but the guy ( bless him ) kept calling and eventually someone picks up.

We spend the next five minutes going back and forth, I keep asking him to bring my phone back to the location where I am - and it was taken from - because I'm on a bicycle. Dude has a car and apparently his Dad is getting old and took my phone by mistake? Not sure. Either way, I'm doing my level best to be polite because I need this guy to do what I want and bring my phone back to the customer service desk while he lectures me about congeniality and being rude over the phone.

At first he refuses to come back to the grocery store and tries to get me agree to go to a second location ( specifically asking me where I'm going ) to meet me there instead.

He then offers to take it to a police station and then asks which one is most convenient for me and I have to clench my teeth and take a breath before continuing.

Another few minutes of back and forth before he relents and says it'll be half an hour.

15,1cda7kc,AITAH for yelling at my auntie?,"So I have a younger sister, she is 3 years younger than me and all my life she has been treated slightly differently than me. Whenever she would do something wrong and get in trouble for it she would put the blame on me (even though I've proven that I wasn't guilty). With my auntie however, she takes things way too far, and I mean way too far. Like during her birthday party one of my younger cousins asked her if she wanted to play with her (keep in mind our younger cousin is 6) when my sister got up to go play with her my auntie told our younger cousin that she didn't want too play with her because my auntie and my sister were watching Taylor Swift. I'm getting off track but this one particular day, we were at a party and my aunt picked my sister and I up and through out the drive she wanted to know what my sister wanted to listen to and of course it was Taylor Swift. She didn't even asked me how my day was she just wanted to spend time with my sister. (Even though they see each other every weekend.) When we arrived at the party we were giving speeches about one of our family members. My aunt got up and said her speech about my family member, I needed to go to the bathroom so I got up and walked towards the bathroom. My cousin was there by the restroom and I asked her if I could go in and she said ""Yes of course I got you cousin"". So I went in and did what I had too do. When I came back out my auntie was there upset at me, she said, "" Can you act mature for once?! Your sister can act more professional and proper unlike you!!""

So I have a younger sister, she is 3 years younger than me and all my life she has been treated slightly differently than me. Whenever she would do something wrong and get in trouble for it she would put the blame on me (even though I've proven that I wasn't guilty). With my auntie however, she takes things way too far, and I mean way too far. Like during her birthday party one of my younger cousins asked her if she wanted to play with her (keep in mind our younger cousin is 6) when my sister got up to go play with her my auntie told our younger cousin that she didn't want too play with her because my auntie and my sister were watching Taylor Swift. I'm getting off track but this one particular day, we were at a party and my aunt picked my sister and I up and through out the drive she wanted to know what my sister wanted to listen to and of course it was Taylor Swift. She didn't even asked me how my day was she just wanted to spend time with my sister. (Even though they see each other every weekend.) When we arrived at the party we were giving speeches about one of our family members. My aunt got up and said her speech about my family member, I needed to go to the bathroom so I got up and walked towards the bathroom. My cousin was there by the restroom and I asked her if I could go in and she said ""Yes of course I got you cousin"". So I went in and did what I had too do. When I came back out my auntie was there upset at me, she said, "" Can you act mature for once?! Your sister can act more professional and proper unlike you!!"" At this point I was mad so I yelled back ""What!?! I needed too go to the bathroom!!!"" she rolled her eyes and said ""No! You know what, I'm telling your father about this. You're acting mean!""

The wedding is a destination wedding clear across the country. The flight will be around $600, the hotel for 3 nights around $400 or so, the nearest airport is an hour away from the resort meaning I’ll have to pay for transportation or a rental car, I have been asked to share costs for a bachelorette party, pay for my own hair and make up, buy my own dress for $130 plus my alterations. Also unsaid expectations to buy bridal shower and wedding gifts. Obviously there would be other expenses while traveling too such as food. The wedding is about 6 weeks away. I’ve been putting off booking anything, trying to convince myself to do it. The resort is located in the middle of nowhere so I can’t try and spin this into a vacation. Lots of people have declined the invitations or backed out of the wedding party already so this is another reason I’ve tried hard not to back out. I feel so guilty. This friend barely speaks to me, we’ve only spent 3 days together in the past year.

17,1cda3et,WIBTA if I tell my partner his parents told me he needs to lose weight?,"WIBTA
So I (34f) and my husband (35m) have been married for 4.5 years. In that time he has put on some weight. I’ll admit I have gained 5-7 lbs since our wedding day, but his is definitely over 50 lbs if I HAD to guess.

It’s always a rollercoaster, he starts a diet for theee weeks and falls off. 

Now even though, I wish he was more consistent I have NEVER said anything negative about his weight gain to him. He works really hard at his job and I can see he is stressed and trying to figure it out. I also can see how upset it makes him when his clothes don’t fit and we have to go shopping for every event (weddings, work events,) for new clothes.

 About 6 months ago my husbands dad, my FIL, came to me privately and told me that he was concerned about his weight and that I needed to talk to him.

This caught me completely off guard, and I didn’t even know what to say. Ultimately I was upset though, because it’s not my job to control my husband NOR am I ABLE to; and HE should know that.

I decided not to tell my husband because I knew it would for sure break his heart, and his dad should have spoken to him directly.

Fast forward to yesterday, I run into his step mom my MIL, and she starts telling me how they are BOTH concerned with his weight.. once again making me feel like it’s somehow my fault?

This time I immediately replied with, “He needs to bring this to him, it’s not my place to relay this message to him”. And then she went onto insinuate that I need to encourage him, and of course I already do. 

I’ve come up with point systems, reward systems, tried to get him to come to CrossFit with me, do weight watchers, noom with me etc. But ultimately I understand that a person will only lose weight when they decide to, it has to be something he makes the decision to commit to.

Keep in mind, this is not the 1950s and I don’t have the luxury of staying home to cook his every meal. We both work full time jobs, and really only eat together on the weekends because i travel a lot. 

I am now in an awkward position of do I tell my husband about these two conversations his parents had with me? Or do I wait and hope they finally approach him instead of me? 

I feel like I’m hiding something by not sharing what has transpired, but I also want to protect him and don’t want to hurt him.

WIBTA if I tell him about these conversations? Or do I let it go and pretend like nothing happened? 

TLDR: my husbands parents told me I have to tell him to lose weight, do I tell him they told me this? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"WIBTA if I tell my partner his parents told me he needs to lose weight? WIBTA

20,1cd9v31,AITA for telling my roommate he must clean up his dog's poop from the yard this weekend?,"So, I want to preface this with some information. My roommate is amazing, outside of cleaning. He actually helped pay a few months in advance to fix an issue caused by the electric company, which was fairly urgent. While he can be stubborn at times, he's always open to talk, and is overall a very understanding person.

I'm preparing to rent out another room in my house, and plan to post it at the start of May (which I told him months ago and stated again throughout April). The house had turned into a bit of a mess, since the entry room was fairly packed with his stuff (and in fairness, a suitcase of mine), and the kitchen was awful (he's the only one who cooks and the oven was filthy, dishes piled in the sink, counters messy and unclean). However, during the last week, he did clean up most of his things from the entry room, got the dishes done, and I finished the other cleaning.

However, after all this, I'm a bit concerned about his daily maintenance. I tried to get him to start doing dishes daily earlier this month, but he never really started. Right now, there's a winter's worth of dog poop in the yard, which he mentioned he'd clean up once it got warmer. He bought a shovel, but never went out. Today, I talked with him to stress how important upkeeping things daily, such as the dishes and stovetop, will be, including cleaning the yard.

He mentioned he'd try to clean the yard sometime soon, but he was busy this weekend with work. I really wanted to stress that it needs to be done daily, and he made the fair point that there is a lot compared to when he does go through and get it to a point where he can do it easier daily. I pointed out that it was very fair, and that I'd ask he at least go out for 20-30min daily until everything is cleaned up, stressing the daily aspect. He got pretty upset (nothing aggressive/no yelling), and said he would get it done by Sunday night. I insisted that he would go out tomorrow, and after a few more times of him saying soon, he reluctantly agreed to do it tomorrow.

However, I realized I was sort of being a hardass. Yes, he should be doing it every day, but I'm not planning to take pictures of the house until the 1st of May, which does give him more time. I came back and apologized for being too much of a hardass, and that it's all good if he gets it done by the end of this weekend, but it was fairly brief. Especially considering how much he helped me out by paying rent in advance (seriously saved me), I feel like an asshole for not giving him more slack in our conversation.

I have a classmate called TJ who we three consider as rude and annoying, Kira said that TJ made mocked for failing an exam last semester and Kevin said that TJ even knocked the door of his flat to ask for help with an assignment for a class I was not taking. 

I am also taking a class with TJ that Kira and Kevin are not taking. In this class we do a lot of simulation work and our lecturer usually guides us during the class and we are meant to write reports after that. The simulation processes are usually really long so you had better not loose any step or ask shortly after that.

At the beginning of the semester TJ asked me for help with an assignment. At the beginning I was going to say yes, so I agreed to meet him after a class with Kira and Kevin that TJ is not Kevin. I asked them about TJ was like and they warned me that he would take a lot of my time. TJ was even desperately phoning me before I arrived. He basically me to go through the whole simulation process again and explain it to him, so I said I didn't remember the whole process and just saved my results for my assignment, which was true and then left.

He has phoned me several times. Last weekend he phoned  me asking for help with an different assignment. I said that I was not at home, which was true and he even asked me to send an exercise  before a specific time so I blocked him. Two days ago I run into him on campus and insistantlly asked me to share the simulation code. I said no because and I said that it would be pretty obvious who copied to whom if we had the same code in an exercise we were supposed to do by ourselves, but he said that he wanted to copy one that we did in class so he insisted. I was suspicious that he would share it with someone else. I'm not sure because sometimes I don't understand his accent. 

I did e-mail him the code, but I didn't not unblock him and I slightly modified some lines so he would get a different result. 

I told my parents about this situation on videochat. My dad thinks I was wrong and I could just have explained the exercise to him, but my mom thinks I'm busy enough. I said that it's too hard to explain something I'm struggling to understand too. 

AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-04-26,"AITA for sharing a wrong code with a colleague? I'm an engineer and am studying a Master's degree. I have a group of 3 friends including a girl, Kira; a lad, Kevin and myself, a lad. 

I have a classmate called TJ who we three consider as rude and annoying, Kira said that TJ made mocked for failing an exam last semester and Kevin said that TJ even knocked the door of his flat to ask for help with an assignment for a class I was not taking. 

I am also taking a class with TJ that Kira and Kevin are not taking. In this class we do a lot of simulation work and our lecturer usually guides us during the class and we are meant to write reports after that. The simulation processes are usually really long so you had better not loose any step or ask shortly after that.

At the beginning of the semester TJ asked me for help with an assignment. At the beginning I was going to say yes, so I agreed to meet him after a class with Kira and Kevin that TJ is not Kevin. I asked them about TJ was like and they warned me that he would take a lot of my time. TJ was even desperately phoning me before I arrived. He basically me to go through the whole simulation process again and explain it to him, so I said I didn't remember the whole process and just saved my results for my assignment, which was true and then left.

He has phoned me several times. Last weekend he phoned  me asking for help with an different assignment. I said that I was not at home, which was true and he even asked me to send an exercise  before a specific time so I blocked him.

24,1cd91ch,AITA for speaking to my neighbor through my door instead of opening it?,"Background: I've lived in my apartment building for 10 years. I work from home and have a hypersomnia neurological disorder that's getting worse. Aside from being sleepy at all times,  I'm sensitive to heat and generally have to have the air conditioner on and a fan blowing on me, even in colder months. I live alone, so I'm rarely in more than shorts and sometimes less.

This is not a ""social"" building. There are 6 other apartments.

* Two are occupied by my elderly Italian immigrant landlord and his wife (they hate each other so he lives in the basement).
* Next door's a young couple who are clearly using the apartment as a pied-à-terre; they're rarely here and mail and packages pile up weekly.
* Below is a 30ish single woman.
* The remaining flats are occupied by an octogenarian lesbian widow and a middle-aged Greek immigrant and his wife.

Aside from my downstairs and next-door neighbors, everyone here was here long before I arrived with my then-roommate 10 years ago. As I said, we've barely interacted. I'm chat with the lesbian widow (she hangs out on the stoop so we have a long conversation when I pass by). Maybe she likes me because I'm queer too, but probably she is just lonely since her wife died 4 years ago.

But that's it. Between the fact that my landlords are always angry and pretend not to speak English and the fact I have nothing in common with anyone else here, it's ""hi, how are you"" if we cross paths..

The \*one\* neighborly thing we all do began when someone started bringing packages from the ""lobby"" and leaving them outside our apartments. Personally, it's not something I want or like--I'm  capable of going down and getting my deliveries; and I'm on the top floor, so I feel guilty that an older person is schlepping up 2 or 3 flights for me. Nevertheless, since I can't stop them from doing it, I do it too. If I pass a package, I bring it up and drop it off.

In 10 years I've had 5 knocks on my door. Once, the landlord knocked for an emergency (burst pipe). Twice, the landlord knocked because he had a bug up his ass about something. Twice, political canvassers somehow got in. That's it. There's a lobby buzzer, so I never have a reason to expect a door knock.

But, last night, the neighborly act of bringing up a package became an intrusion. I was passed out on my sofa, naked, with the TV on (remember, I have a neurological disorder that makes me hypersomniac and hot). Then KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. I wake up, confused. ""Hello? Who is it?"" KNOCK KNOCK. ""One minute?"" I get up and go to the door. ""Who is this?"" ""It's your neighbor!"" (Um, which one?) ""What's up, is something wrong?"" ""I have your package for you."" ""Uh, thanks...but I'm in the middle of something, can you just leave it there?"" ""OK. I'm your neighbor."" ""Uh, thanks? I'm sorry?"" She goes away and I can hear her grumbling.

I was naked, disoriented, it was 9 PM, and I didn't ask for hand delivery, but...am I the asshole? I don't want to be a misanthrope; what could I have done better?

25,1cd8ynz,UPDATE: AITA for not speaking Japanese after living here for 6 years,"My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/MeESRljwno

So, we got divorced. 
I think about it more and more and I feel like this 6 years has been hell for me… I am tired of keep on finding any reason to think that he is good for me.

I found a full time job in a Japanese company and started working there from last January. Everybody in my new company said I speak Japanese well. And so far I am doing great! I rent my own apartment and surviving by my own just fine in Tokyo. Albeit my ex husband saying that I would never be able to survive in Japan without him.

I have a crush on other guy, but I take it slowly. 

Thank you for all of your comment to me. i am glad I posted here.

Edit: I use only Japanese in the company I work now and earn almost same amount with my ex husband despite just work here for 4 months. My crush now speak only japanese and we communicate just fine.

I am confident now!


Another long edit because I am surprised that I got so many responses:

Thank you so much for the comments and supports. Just to clarify, of course the reason of my divorce is not only because of the language thing…

I kept saying my ex was a good person (and I still think that he is a good person) but he is not treating me right.

There were a lot of things he had done to me that had harmed me physically and mentally.

Before I was with him, I was also doing modeling for side job. I took good care of myself, but after I married him, he said that my look didnt matter and he disliked me dressing up or putting on make up because thought as a married woman I should not attract other men. I did what he wanted and I kept telling myself “oh this man loves me the way I am no matter how I look…” but then I found out he was following sexy girls on instagram and twitter.

He never chatted them so I let it slide but I kept thinking about it. Especially since he never said anything positive about my look (basically he never said anything positive about my effort except for my cooking) I started to feel unconfident. I got depressed and had to take anti depressant then I gained 20 kgs in 6 years.

When I said he never said anything positive about my look/effort it didnt mean that he always said bad things about me, just he seems to be indifferent about it.

Now, after we got divorced, I dont have to take my anti depressant anymore. And I lost 15 kgs already… I started to talk to some guys until I met my crush right now.

I was surprised because my crush now always said that I look good and nice, he noticed when I changed my hair style or nail, saying I smell nice, and compliment me when I do good thing at work (my crush works in the same company with me).

The other people also said that I look super good now, and I look so much happier.

I want to show you my pictures so you can see the difference between when I was single, married, and became single again, but I know there is a chance some of you might recognize me…. And then would recognize who is my ex husband and it would cause problem for him.

Anyway, how I learned Japanese (and other languages) is by listening to some song, movies, or other people, then when I cant understand some word/phrase, I would find it in dictionary based on how I hear it. Then I have to guess how it is written so I can find the word in dictionary/translator. I prefer dictionary to translator though because when I open dictionary I will see many other words other than the one I am looking for and I may remember those words I accidentally find too…

After I find the word and understand what it means, i will try to make a sentence with that word and use it in real conversation.

Now, I can already read Japanese’s comic book and watch the movie in cinema without much difficulty. :)

Once again thank you for your support!

Please wish me luck for my career and my life ahead. (Also for my crush, hope it ends well)

I also wish all the best for all of you, may you learned something from my experience and may it be useful for you or at least it could give you good feeling when you read this update.

Cheers!

26,1cd8ltl,AITA for refusing to help my wife?,"This morning I refused to help my wife get up out of bed.

For context, my wife is very overweight. I'm not here to complain about this fact—she's been large since I first met her, and I've always found her attractive.  But she has gained a significant amount of weight over the last 4 years.

Shortly before our daughter was born in 2019, my wife weighed in at an appointment and was 428 lbs. This was a shock to me; I knew she had gained a lot of weight since we met, but she is private about it so I never heard a number. Once she and our daughter were home, we tried to take healthy steps to improve ourselves together. She recovered well from her pregnancy, and was set to resume her job in March of 2020. COVID changed that plan. After 1 week back at her job, she was furloughed for 2 weeks. At the end of that period they fired her. Luckily, my job went remote and I make enough to support our family.

For the past four years, she has become increasingly reclusive. When I have offered to take time off to give her a break from the kids, she has declined. We started taking stay-cations in summer 2020, and even once the pandemic was over she has said she prefers staying at home to traveling. Her weight has noticeably increased during this time; I don't have a number but I wouldn't be surprised if she's now over 500. Her mobility has suffered as well—she needs breaks when we take walks, we've had to put wall handles in our bathroom, and the last few months she needs help to get out of bed in the morning.

When I've tried to address this with her, she admits it's a problem, but she downplays its severity. Our marriage is great, she is a great mother to our two children, there's nothing (at least nothing she's shared) under the surface: she says she just likes to eat and struggles to control her portions and snacking.

This most recent incident started because yesterday evening, as we were taking our kids to the park, she insisted that I drive instead of her. Her insistence weirded me out and I asked her about it later when we were going to bed. She informed me that she's begun struggling to fit behind the wheel of our family car. This really freaked me out, and we had a long conversation before going to sleep. She again denied anything was wrong, and when I suggested she visit the doctor to get a better picture of her health she was pretty annoyed. I was upset and told her to think about how she would take care of the kids if something happened to me. It's not safe for her to rely on me for so much. She kept ignoring me and went to sleep. I stayed up and stewed a little bit.

This morning, to prove a point, I refused to help her out of bed. I just went into the bathroom. She was able to get up eventually, but it took a few attempts and she was crying and begging for help. I went in to work in my home office, and since I got off work she has been unwilling to talk to me.

27,1cd8loa,AITA for telling my teacher the inappropriate things my lifelong friends have been saying about her? ,"I (16M) have this amazing teacher at my school. She is kind of young, and she is around 23-24 years old, we could call her TC for her initials. I also have these friends that I have had for most of my life, most I have had around for about 4-10 years. 
We are all in her 5th period class in high school. She is an amazing teacher. She teaches us stuff everyday and still lets us talk to each other. She also lets us come every day to her room during a free period, and she is always funny. All of us like her, like I said before, she is funny, kind, and caring. But recently, the friend group that I was in for that class, has been annoying for the last couple months. 
First of all, they are all kind of just dicks now. They talk shit to each other all the time and it is just a toxic feeling. I still love all of them, just they are annoying sometimes. And I forgot to say this before but TC is my favorite teacher ever, and she is amazing in kind of everything. I can’t explain it really. But anyway, my friends have started to say weird stuff about her too. I think the main reason they say it is because of how nice she is and that she is young. But it gets out of hand a lot of the time. They just talk about doing stuff to her that I don’t have the heart to type out, but you know what I mean. They also just say generic weird stuff to her. 

My one friend made a “hoe list” and made a ton of people (including TC) on there and people that he would.. you know. It is really fucked up typing it. But this has been going on for a while, and it sucks cause she never knew. I decided I had to tell her.
      I went to her a lot and tried to convince her to let me tell her everything, and she let me. I told her a lot, but not everything. Before I tell this, I have to give a backstory. So apparently, she had a condition or something (I don’t really know what she said?) but it made her overweight or something. And my friend told me one day, “did you know TC was a fatass in Highschool?”, and I talked to him and said that it was weird to bring that up. Another thing I have to explain, TC is currently engaged with another teacher at the school, and they have been dating since 7th grade. My friend then followed up with “what did Mr. (TC’s fiancée) see in TC” and I thought that was kind of fucked up. So I told her about that.

",Asshole,2024-04-26,"AITA for telling my teacher the inappropriate things my lifelong friends have been saying about her?  I (16M) have this amazing teacher at my school. She is kind of young, and she is around 23-24 years old, we could call her TC for her initials. I also have these friends that I have had for most of my life, most I have had around for about 4-10 years. 
We are all in her 5th period class in high school. She is an amazing teacher. She teaches us stuff everyday and still lets us talk to each other. She also lets us come every day to her room during a free period, and she is always funny. All of us like her, like I said before, she is funny, kind, and caring. But recently, the friend group that I was in for that class, has been annoying for the last couple months. 
First of all, they are all kind of just dicks now. They talk shit to each other all the time and it is just a toxic feeling. I still love all of them, just they are annoying sometimes. And I forgot to say this before but TC is my favorite teacher ever, and she is amazing in kind of everything. I can’t explain it really. But anyway, my friends have started to say weird stuff about her too. I think the main reason they say it is because of how nice she is and that she is young. But it gets out of hand a lot of the time. They just talk about doing stuff to her that I don’t have the heart to type out, but you know what I mean. They also just say generic weird stuff to her. 

My one friend made a “hoe list” and made a ton of people (including TC) on there and people that he would.. you know. It is really fucked up typing it. But this has been going on for a while, and it sucks cause she never knew. I decided I had to tell her.
      I went to her a lot and tried to convince her to let me tell her everything, and she let me. I told her a lot, but not everything. Before I tell this, I have to give a backstory. So apparently, she had a condition or something (I don’t really know what she said?) but it made her overweight or something. And my friend told me one day, “did you know TC was a fatass in Highschool?”, and I talked to him and said that it was weird to bring that up. Another thing I have to explain, TC is currently engaged with another teacher at the school, and they have been dating since 7th grade. My friend then followed up with “what did Mr. (TC’s fiancée) see in TC” and I thought that was kind of fucked up. So I told her about that. And she thanked me and stuff like that, and I told her to not tell anyone in the friend group the stuff I was going to tell her. I felt so bad for her. I could tell she was very sad.

Throwaway, on mobile so sorry for typos, fake names

I (28f) have been friends with Tina (28f) since college. We were freshman year roommates and have been very close ever since. Even though we’re really good friends, Tina and I are really different people. I’m the life of the party and Tina is more of the quiet and mousy type. we were totally inseparable in college. When we were in school, I took Tina to every party and introduced her to everyone I knew, including Henry (29m, Tina’s now-husband). To be honest, I think Henry used to have a crush on me, but he was never really my type. He’s kinda dorky tbh. Henry and Tina got together in junior year after being friends for a while and they’re absolutely perfect for each other–I’ve never been anything but happy for them both.

Anyway, Tina and I are so close that we can go a long time without talking, but we get each other’s life update on social media. That’s how I found out that Tina and Henry are finally getting married. I was thrilled, but thought it was weird that they didn’t send me an invitation. I figured it was a mistake and my invite just got lost in the mail, so I found out through a mutual friend where and when the wedding was and was thankfully able to make it.

At the wedding, Tina gave me a weird look when she saw me in the audience and Henry was just staring at me the whole time. I shrugged it off at first but something just didn’t feel right. I couldn’t get rid of the nagging feeling that something was wrong and it just kept getting worse the longer I stayed, so I objected when the officiant asked. Tina was furious, but I told her that things just didn’t feel right and I only wanted to help her and Henry. She told me that she didn’t even invite me and that I had no right to interfere in her life like that before kicking me out.

I was really hurt by what Tina said to me, but I’m giving her some space to think before I try talking to her again.

29,1cd8cc5,WIBTA if I moved out of my college apartment with our jointly-owned cats?,"I (24F) live with two other roommates, one of them my age and then her older sister. We have lived together for almost 5 years. We get along pretty good, except for her older sister and I are both introverted and don't necessarily click well.

A year and a half ago, we came into ownership of two kittens. At the time, we had no real plans to move out or separate, as we have a pretty good living situation. I take care of the cats primarily as I work from home; I feed them, groom them (brush and trim their nails), clean up after them (vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, etc), play with them, cuddle them, etc. My two roommates' only responsibility is to take care of the litter box - which they fail to do oftentimes and I am stuck cleaning up the litter box for them.

The cats have chosen me as their favorite person. Even when my roommates are home, they are attached to me at the hip.

Our landlord has recently informed us that he plans on selling the property. He offered to sell it directly to us, but it's marked ridiculously high that we couldn't afford the mortgage even if we evenly split it. So - we're faced with either moving out, or praying that the new owners will not jack up rent prices or kick us out.

I believe our current landlord would let us break our lease early and move to avoid the hassle of showing a house with tenants occupying it. I want to live on my own and I would like to take the cats with me.

However, I think they are attached to the cats similarly to me. The cats are legally mine; their adoption paperwork and microchips are in my name.

30,1cd8c8v,AITA for not saying much after my friend cut a guy off?,"so i (16f) am friends with someone (15f) who we’ll call jess. jess and i have been friends for a few years now, and we love talking to each other. 

recently (about 3 weeks ago), jess started talking to this guy. of course, i was all for it, because i love to see my friend happy. during the time she was talking to the guy, though, he was all she’d talk about - not exaggerating. from day to night, for those 2-3 weeks, the main topic of conversation was the guy she was talking to, and i’m sure you can predict that i was starting to get tired of it soon enough. 

less than half of the times in that whole time period did she ever ask about how i was doing or what was going on in my life, probably less than 10. even when she did, she’d usually just go back to talking about the boy again a couple messages after. that kinda hurt me, because i always make sure to ask her how she’s doing and what’s going on with her before i start talking to her.

so, today, jess messages me and tells me she cut him off because something felt off to her. i kind of just started at the message, because this was the same guy i feel she was kind of neglecting me for. i’ll admit, my responses were kind of dry, but i didn’t really know what to say in that situation because she would always talk about how she liked him so much then she suddenly ended things. along with that, i was kind of busy when she was telling me all of this, too, but i don’t think how occupied i was would’ve changed what i said. 

after a couple of messages back and forth about how she cut this guy off and why, she asks if she messed up. i said “i don’t know” because i honestly didn’t - this was her relationship, not mine. i barely even know who the guy is. after i say that, she responds with “nvm then”. when i tried to message her a couple hours later, she texted like she was mad at me for not giving her a better response.

 I have just started swimming classes, so I was feeling a lot hungrier than normal when dinner arrived. We sat down to watch netflix, she offered her sandwich and I took a bite out of it, then I offered mine. She took a bite that seemed proportionally much larger than the one I took, and I (again, I was very hungry) said something on the lines of ""Whoa, you took too big of a bite for someone who's just sampling it"". I could tell she did not find it funny, so I just explained that if I'm biting into someone elses food I try to go for the smallest bite possible and then I did not press the issue any further, but I also said that I wasn't really angry about the bite. It could have just looked a big bite from my angle or it could be that I was just hungry. For me it was solved immediately: I made a comment, she did not like that, I won't insist, it's fine.   


But during the episode she got non-verbal and stopped interacting with me, giving me the silent treatment, so to speak.   
At the end of the episode the silence was really weird and upsetting. We had planned to see more stuff, so after she asked what to do I told her that if she was going to stay like that I would rather not share time together because it's just unpleasant to watch stuff in a situation like that.   
So she immediately was very angry with me. She said that she was feeling huge and disgusting and masculine because of what I said. This did not make any sense to me and I was very disoriented by this reaction, So maybe I was a insensitive by asking if this was not a bit much over a comment that was made in a irreverent way about a sandwich.   


To this, she got even more upset and told me that she has issues with her weight, that she has TOLD ME that before and that I was an being an asshole by saying she eats too much.   
Another disclaimer: She has complained to me about feeling clumsy and she did mention her weight a few times, but it is not constant.

So I explained that I didn't said that she eats too much. Complaining about a large bite in an un-serious manner is absolutely not the same as saying someone eats too much. I also said I could be wrong about and just hungry, which caused the comment.  


She said that it doesn't matter. You should never say that to someone that has weight issues. I said that I was sorry, but honestly I could not know she would feel so bad.

Since arriving I have talked to him twice, not including 2 letters I have received from him. His phone is broken so if he gets to call it is from an unknown number because he is using a battle Buddy’s phone. 
I work as a cashier in a very small town near a high traffic freeway. We get a lot of truck drivers and travelers coming through our town. That being said my Boss is a total duchebag and has zero compassion or empathy for his employees. 
Onto the situation which occurred 2 weeks ago, I was working at the counter next to my boss during a large rush of people came into the store. In the middle of this rush I realized I was being called on my cellphone, I knew I couldn’t run off because I would probably be fired. Once the rush was over I told my boss I missed a very important phone call and asked if I could go call back. He said not now, that he had to run to the back office. 5 minutes later he came back up and said I could go call back. I walked out of the store and called the number back twice, to no answer. I then called my mom crying telling her the situation having an anxiety attack. After about 5 minutes I walked back into the store still freaking out (I have severe anxiety and didn’t have my meds to help calm me down so I was visibly distraught and still teary eyed). My boss asked what the phone call was about so I told him the situation, how I had possibly missed the chance to speak to my boyfriend and was very upset about it. My boss then went on a tangent about how I can’t just run away from the counter in the middle of a rush to answer a call and how it was very unprofessional of me to walk away from the counter when I was needed to “talk to some boy” mind you my boyfriend and I had lived together for over 6 months before he left and my boss was well aware of this. He is not “some boy” in any capacity.

I left that day apologizing to the girl because I think I was just as shocked as she was, and she said it would be a lot on her bucket to carry that role anyways.

      When I got home I checked my email to see the day prior the project had been approved and the girl was happy to start and wanted volunteers for a start. I feel like I took someone's position, I feel terribly guilty, and I want to apologize again tomorrow for my ignorance, as I cross paths with her a few times a day. 

     I want to go into the the specific councils purpose for my career, (I don't know about the girl), so this is mainly my way of getting a head start. AITA for ""stealing"" the election? Do I contact this girl and apologize?",0.0,0.1092413,0,1

I currently work at a medical office where I've been for over a year now. When I started this job I was told it could be done completely from home. Quickly that changed.

The reason I work from home is because this job is a 2 hour drive from my home. I currently only go in once a week, I've denied them when they asked if I could come in more. 

But now I've expressed to my boss that I would like an evaluation and I plan to ask for a raise (I plan to ask for $12 an hour but we'll see). This evaluation hasn't even happened and I'm being asked again to come in 3 days a week.

36,1cd7xdb,AITA for telling my uncle off about not selling my late mother's piano on my birthday?,"I 27 (m) just celebrated my 27th birthday with my brother who also is 27 years old on April 20th and we had a wonderful time. We had immediate family come over and celebrate our birthday before I and my twin went and celebrated on our own. 

I just had cake, cupcakes, and alcohol when the mood of the party took a turn for the worst. 

For context My uncle is someone who is a massive pain in my ass when it comes to my life, he thinks that it would be more efficient to tell my dad how to live our lives, especially when it comes to our house. For context, my dad is having renovation in our house and he’s trying to upgrade the sub-basement in our house to look presentable. I tried to explain my feelings to my uncle who is a male in his early 50s who cannot grasp the concept that we are not a typical family. I am a young man who still lives with his dad because of my autism. 

So how did this connect with my mother‘s piano you may ask? Well, my mother died in 2012 because of cancer and the piano is her last possession and I am very connected to this instrument. It was on my birthday last week that my uncle suggested that we sell the piano for money without even consulting, my father, me, or my brother. he reasoned that she was dead, and I and my brother had to get over that my heart sank Her death was over 12 years ago and I cannot seem to get over the fact that he made the awful suggestion that I have to sell this piano that she spent over $1200 and she would play every single day.

I should let you know that both my aunt and uncle are right-wing extremists who shamed me for being bisexual and being myself. They judged my every move. 

They are not good people even tho they are Evangelical Christians. 

I thought to myself he is an asshole. Why would he make that kind of suggestion, knowing that I was very close to my mother.?

So am I the asshole for calling out my uncle and telling him that I will not sell the piano because it’s too sentimental?

A bit of context...
In my childhood, I had a happy life, parents together who seemed to be fine, a brother and a family that loved me. As time went by, my parents had problems, they divorced, so my brother and I stayed with my mom in the same house where we had lived since we were little. The relationship with my Father at that time was very good but gradually deteriorated because he made his life and without realizing it, he pushed me and my brother aside.

Returning to the present, that house was always being fought over by my parents, on one hand, my mom wanting to leave it at my brother and I names, and on the other hand, my dad wanting to take it away and sell it. In the end, due to problems with the lawyers and a trial in which my mom did not show up because she was never notified, the judge ended up ruling in favor of my dad and part of his family (because they were also behind everything), we were just notified that we had 7 days to leave the house or we would be forcibly removed. We did what we could but in the end, they kicked us out in a horrible way because both my dad's lawyer and those they hired treated us like the worst.

Maybe I didn't give all the context, but I know that despite everything my dad didn't want to hurt us even though he did it in the worst way. He didn't care what we felt, he didn't care what we thought, he didn't care about anything other than his hatred and contempt towards my mom and dragged us in the worst possible way... He wants to fix things but neither he nor his family apologized to my brother and me for what they did to us, somehow he believes it's okay and that ""it was all my mom's fault"" even though he orchestrated everything so the only thing they did was act as if nothing had happened. He says he wants to mend things and fix the relationship with us to the point that he bought me a car and gave us some money but I simply don't see it possible, not only do I have a lot of remorse towards him but it makes me uncomfortable and quite depressed to be with someone who was capable of doing all the harm he did to me just because he felt a lot of resentment towards someone who wasn't me (in this case, my mom).

41,1cd78qp,AITA - Graduation Tickets,"Background - I had a child with someone 17 years ago that I am no longer with. I married my current husband when our child was 3 years old. From birth to 3 years old, my child's father was uninvolved, however his family was VERY involved. He has never paid child support ($100 per month),often avoided employment to not pay, and was arrested due to non payment.

 Although my family (husband & kids) lived in different states due to my husband's job, our child would visit their father for summers and Christmas holiday. We moved back to the same city as him 5 years ago and while he is still unemployed (just working gig work here and there), he sees our child every other weekend and 1 month in the summer. He is able to do that with the help of family and friends (staying with them when the child visits).

Current Situation  - Our child is graduating next month and we only get 10 tickets to split. I have allocated three tickets for him (1 for my child's father, and two more for family on his side that have really supported the child--- his parents cannot attend). The other 7 are for the 5 people that live in the house with the child (my husband, myself, and my other kids), the other 2 are for my mother and father (they are divorced) --- They supported me fully with our child. My child's father is upset that I do not split the tickets evenly ... 5&5. At the very least, he said my mother could go but he wants a 4th ticket for a close family member that would travel from out of town. I told him, "" Unfortunately, everyone that deserves to go will not be able to attend.""  I love this family member and if I had more tickets, they would go. 

The school is small and will likely not be able to allow for more tickets, but I have already requested. I also suggested that my child's father take the child and the people of their choice out for lunch after graduation as I planned to do a BBQ for my family that couldn't attend.

42,1cd773c,"AITA for wanting to share our pregnancy news with my parents, without my wife","Me (37m) and my wife (33f) learned that she is about 8 weeks pregnant. We are delighted but also terrified. It is the first time for both of us.

  
She has asked me to not share the news with anyone until we get to about 12 weeks, when the pregnancy will be stable. So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month. 

  
She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information. She did share it with her parents, and they were overjoyed – the house is in a festive mood, they cannot stop smiling and laughing, etc.

  
I am still under an information embargo though.  
(note: I did ask her to let me share with a couple of select people, for my own mental sanity, since I really needed to be able to open up to a friend. She was fine with it)

  
Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I.

  
I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same ‘joyous family moment’ like she did. 

  
My wife took it badly.  
I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever. 

  
She is very upset. I reminded her that we did not announce to \*her\* parents jointly. She is saying that I did not express any desire to do so (which is true, I did not even think of it) … but since she is clearly communicating \*her\* desire to me, it is different, and I should hear her. Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole?

Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole?

44,1cd6xg5,AITA for not wanting to cover my friend's husband shift the week of when their baby is due?,"I f(26) have been working for this small Korean family business for the past year. I was approached by my friend who is pregnant and her husband a year ago asking if I was willing to work for her dad's company. Her husband, Steve, said the company would hold my hand through it all and reassured I didn't need any experience in the field. At the time I had just recently quit a toxic job while also living in a toxic household. I didn't really think of it much and agreed because I honestly needed the money. The company was small and only had 5 employees including myself. The Boss (friend's dad), Floor manager (her husband), Accountant (her mom), Main Manager (dad's friend) and me. I found myself having to figure out everything as Steve was too busy to mentor me. They expected me to work during our lunch. ""We as a company need to prioritize the clients and must give the best services at all cost."" The work increased by a lot and it was clear I was not fitted to take this amount of work this early that required a lot more steps. I asked for help but was told to pull through. I started making mistakes, I got in trouble and then the yelling started for not knowing the steps even though the company has not handled this client before. I was told I didn't work fast enough, and needed to stay after hours to work to finish work. The boss yelled, saying how dumb I was, that I didn't have any common sense, everything was my fault. He continued to yell at me in Korean. I did not understand what he was saying, but he was using his gesture to mock me. I gathered my stuff and went downstairs and saw my friend sitting there waiting for her husband. I was embarrassed. My boss and wife would get extremely upset for the smallest things. I was belittled, mocked, and they made sure to tell their clients I wasn't Korean. I was being micromanaged for everything. I was set up to be given all the terrible clients, I was set for failure. I cried everyday. I started having panic attacks driving home, couldn't sleep, and started having nightmares. To top it off, the HR was Steve. There would be times when Steve would standing up for me but would also say I need to take the blame for everything even if the client is wrong, or if the boss was upset he would make sure to tell me that when the boss came in to just keep my head down, and work quietly. My friend will be due next week and Steve is expecting me to take over his workload so he can be with his wife and baby but his work is completed different than what I’m handling and I cant bare the thought of being yelled at again. I am planning on quitting tomorrow and I want to know if what I am doing is right. I do feel guilty that my friend’s husband might not be able to be with his family due to me quitting.

46,1ce0gss,AITA for not letting my sister into my apartment?,"About a year ago I (21) moved into an apartment with my husband (21) 
I moved out of my mothers house and into my brothers house at 16. So this is the first place I can actually call mine.

My mother had a hoarding issue, and often picked up things off the side of the road.
Due to this habit we ended up getting bed bugs and to this day my mother has and continues to do nothing about them.
That is the main reason I chose to move out.

With that said, I told my sister she could visit while she’s in college and closer to us as much as she wanted, as my other three brothers who do not live with my mother come and visit regularly.
I have been no contact with my mother since moving out.

Recently my sister has moved out of the dorms and back into my mother’s house. 

When she lived in the dorms, I didn’t have to worry about her bringing bugs, as my mother refused to visit her in college, and my sister doesn’t bother to go home unless it is needed for emergency’s. 

Due to her moving back in, I told her that she has to change in the guest bathroom, which is directly next to the front door, before actually coming further into my apartment. And leave her cloths in a bag outside my apartment.
I purchased multiple things for her to wear, in her size and in her style to wear at my house, because of this rule, I know it wouldn’t be fair to expect her to buy clothes she will only wear at my house.
I have spend over $200 for her to be comfortable in my home.

I also explained my reasons to her multiple times, bed bugs have left me with a lot of anxiety and stress. They are also hard to get rid of.

She came to visit Wednesday, when she arrived I was running errands, so I had told her to let herself in with the spare key I gave her, I reminded her that the cloths for her are in the linen closet, and I even bought new hoodies for her to try.

When I came home, she was sitting on my couch, in cloths she arrived in, with a blanket she had brought from our mother’s house. My sister isn’t a very feminine person, and her wardrobe is very small, excluding the things I keep at my apartment.
So I know these are cloths she’s worn in our mother’s bed bug infested house.

I panicked and told her she had to get off the couch and change, immediately.
This upset her and she started to accuse me of calling her filthy, nasty and other words.
I tried to explain to her again that bringing things from our mother’s house could risk bringing bugs to my apartment, and I could be evicted for it, not to mention I’d just rather not have bugs again, they are incredibly traumatizing if you’ve ever had them.

She accused me of being paranoid, and essentially called me an asshole. She left with her things, and
I had my husband take apart the couch and take it to a storage unit when he got home.

Since then I have gotten a few messages from other relatives, telling me I had no right to kick my own sister out of my house.

I (52f) have two stepdaughters through my husband of five years Donna (26f) and Dana (21f), and while Dana and I had a decent relationship I virtually had no relationship with Donna. Although, not through lack of trying. I met and dated my husband for two years before I actually married him and during that time I tried to reach out to Donna and offered to take her out on fun outings, figure out what her interests were, or even engage in some polite conversation during family gatherings.

Donna was not interested and I started to back off when I felt her annoyance at my behavior. I wasn't trying to be the type of stepmom who wants to replace the dead one, I just wanted to have a positive relationship. I ask my husband for tips but he told me not to bother as Donna has always been stand offish and difficult. Her grandparents told her to just give her time while Dana called her a stubborn and sensitive b\*tch. Apparently Donna wasn't very nice to Dana's mom (they're half sisters) and she blames her for her parents divorce and resents the fact that Donna is their grandparents favorite.

I wanted to ask more about it but I felt like that would be too pushy and nosy and just kept on. When My husband and I got engaged I reached out to Donna (through her grandparents) about her being a bridesmaid but she declined and didn't even show up to the wedding. I was hurt but didn't say anything when she graduated I didn't kick up a fuss about not being invited to the ceremony but passed along a message in the form of a card stating what an amazing accomplishment this was for her, that she has so much potential, I know how much her mom would be proud of her as I would be of my own children (I've got two kids from a prior relationship), and that I'm here for any advice if she needs it.

After that I just let it be. Then I found out the past family drama and it all clicked. Dana's mom was a horrible stepmom to Donna. Dana's mom treated her horribly and favored her own daughter constantly. Dana's mom even took jewelry that belonged to Donna's mom for herself and sold most of them. My husband did nothing about it.

I had a horrible stepparent myself and really felt for Donna so I went through Dana's room, found Donna's mom's necklace and then gave it to Donna's aunt who in turn gave it to Donna. This has caused a lot of strife between me and my husband but I refuse to apologize. Dana's is now calling me a b\*tch and a thief and says that she's going to call the authorities unless I pay her so AITA?

51,1cdzgfs,AITA for telling my boyfriend there are more important things than football?,"My boyfriend (29m) and I (27f) have been together 3 years in July. We moved in together a couple of months ago. 

We made plans to attend a memorial event this weekend with my family, but his football team won last week and they have an impromptu match this Sunday, during the time we should be with my family. 

He is demanding that he goes, and when I told him I needed support, I got accused of being controlling and that I don’t respect his hobbies (because I don’t follow or really like football). When I reminded him of our prior commitment I was told he doesn’t care, and he absolutely must be at the game. His compromise was to attend the event but be back in time for football, which physically is not possible due to the travel time. 

He hasn’t really spoken to me for 3 days over this issue and when I asked him tonight if football was more important than me, he refused to give me an answer - which told me pretty much everything I need to know. I left. I’m staying with a friend tonight and I think my relationship might be over.

52,1cdzes9,AITA for wanting the nice room in my house?,"So, I’ve been living in this large female house for two years now. There’s a basement with 3 rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. And then upstairs there’s two rooms a kitchen and a bathroom. And then there is this gorgeous attic space that has lots of windows, is the size of the two smallest rooms in the house and has a 1/2 bath. Keep in mind the basement is much smaller, and slightly less nice than the rest of the house. 

I’ve been living in the basement for two years, and gave up the chance to move into the attic last year because one of the other girls living in the basement expresses to me how much she would appreciate the attic space given it was going to be the hardest year of her schooling, so I gave it up to her and told her it would be good to save money anyways(the attic being more expensive).

now, my friend from high school who moved in last year wants to move into the attic. Initially, I was going to move into another place because 1) two of the girls that have lived here two years with me are going abroad next semester and 2) I was tired of living in the basement and 3) I’m going to have a very busy year next year, taking 16 credits and working two 12s as a PCT, as well as taking 8 ams everyday  and was nervous about such a large household impacting my ability to function.

However my new housing option fell through, and I was content because I had the opportunity to move to the main level on account of the other girls going abroad. I also could not afford the price of the attic at the time.

However, we were able to negotiate the cost of rent for next year, and it is now at a price I can afford. 

This roommate who wants the attic is upset that I now am expressing interest, even though I communicated before that the only reason I didn’t want it before was due to cost. 

I think she’s also frustrated bc when I was supposed to be moving out she talked privately with other roommates about her getting the attic. In our last roommate meeting(before I was planning on moving out) I had expressed wanting to move upstairs but not being able to afford it at that cost. 
Later in a private conversation with her about the cost, she said that she wanted to pay less for the attic, and I mentioned that at the cost she was proposing, I would also want the room. She quickly dropped her idea. 

Now, due to conversations she has had with other roommates, she’s been planning it all in her head to move up there which I understand makes this frustrating for me to be bringing up.

I just went to talk to her and laid out my reasons. She said we were in the same boat (her taking 17 credits and getting an internship in a lab next semester, however she did not disclose how many hours and had previously expressed to me her admiration for how much I’ll be working and schooling next semester). She also made a guilting comment about how she’s already ordered a new bedframe for the space.

I understand why she’s frustrated, but I also am frustrated because I didn’t think we were making any final room decisions until after we heard from our landlord about lowering the price, but it seems like everyone has been talking amongst themselves anyways. 

Am I the asshole for wanting this space and asking for it in this way?

We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country. 

I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1"" and my brother is 6'6"". I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets. 

This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight. 

When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did ""was awful."" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start. 

I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said ""no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking?"" I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said ""what do you think its about?"" I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said ""an asshole makes people beg, family members don't.""

When I asked him why he first asked me out he said it was because of my appearance and the fact that I performed well academically and I didn't think too much of it.

We're now in the final semester, and I've been feeling a little irritated with him because he's asked me to proofread almost all of his assignments and edit them for him. Out of 8 essays, I've edited 6 of his. I've never asked him or anyone for help with my assignments, and especially not to that degree. I was particular upset with his request for help with the final essay at the end of the semester as I was juggling my part-time job and preparing for a job interview. To make matters worse, I fell really sick and was going in and out of a high fever so I only started my own essay the day before it was due. This was all known to him, and at his initial request for help I made it clear that i couldn't even cope with my own essay so I was not in the state to help him. He said he understood but a few hours later he sent me chunks of his essay and asked me to vet it if I had the time. I was very upset because it felt like he basically ignored what I said and just sent it to me anyways in hopes that I could read it. I didn't want to argue so I just did it anyway at around 11 pm.

For some context, academics are taken very seriously back where I'm from and it's extremely competitive. Sabotaging and taking advantage of each other is not uncommon. I've been used before (plagiarism of my work, copying my entire reference list, etc.) by people I thought were friends so, I've been feeling unsettled by his requests for help. His reasoning was that I'm the smartest person he knows and since he's in such close proximity to someone like that, why not make use of it? He compliments my work after reading it all the time by saying he could never write the way I write but I always get so irritated when he says it and I don't even know why. With exams coming up, he's asked to see my notes and to explain concepts to him but I've been in a poor mental state so I don't know how to tell him that I need to prioritise my own academics and may not have the bandwidth to help him (I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I tend to self-isolate under stress).

My mom said I was an idiot for letting a man take advantage of me like this but other than this whole situation with uni, I really enjoy his company. I've been thinking of bringing up how I felt used with him but I would like to know if what I'm feeling is really valid or if I'm just being sensitive. More opinions would help me make a better judgement, thank you for reading.

for context, we dont consider the highschool grad the actual graduation because the amount of people i can invite is limited, so the other one is the actual graduation so i want my family to be there at the party

okay so i tried voicing that i want my family and relatives to be there since a graduation is a pretty big deal, but they just shut me down because they dont want supervision, plus i tried saying its not nice to not include mary and sara since this is a graduation and at the end of the day these girls have been with us for yearsss it wont hurt to have them at a party

So ever since I we told my MIL that we were pregnant with my first child she’s been extremely overbearing. Which every grandparent says “my baby” and stuff like that so that was bearable. She constantly touched my face belly hair (which always asked her not to because I’m not an affectionate person and do not like be touched, due to S A) so she was already pushing on one of my big boundaries while pregnant. 

      So as any first time parent the boundaries we set forth, no kissing, no touching of the face, and no coming around when sick. Which I think are normal respectable boundaries set for both sides of the family. So after we had our first child was born, since the day she met our child. She constantly every single time disrespected the boundaries completely. Every time MIL was confronted it was a big problem, and always turned into me or husband being the bad guy. Our first child has extremely sensitive skin (we provided everything the child  needed if the child was at their house, so there was no need for MIL to purchase anything or buy her own separate products) constantly she would use bottles that were not what I would bring with me (had certain ones that reduced spit up bc of acid reflux) diapers, wipes, butt rash cream, & body wash that would break the baby’s skin out horribly. 

       So we reduced contact with MIL bc of it, and only use MIL in emergencies. Well obviously she had someone questions or take offense when we choose to do supervised visits (no over night staying or baby sitting) but after explaining our reasons it’s a fight. She is obsessed with first child ever since pretty much I was pregnant. Child doesn’t like to be held a lot and what not due to sensory issues and is just all around not a huge cuddler, more independent. Everytime we visit or she visits no matter what she has to hog the child no matter what including forcibly holding child and occasionally when first child needs to stay, upon returning home there is behavioral issues or extreme night terrors. 

       Now due to how I was treated with first child, they don’t really know our second child. For instance some call me an asshole but I like a private labor and delivery, I just want my mom and my husband there we don’t alert anyone until after both children were born. Even face timed, directly after  children were born. My husband went over after my second child was born and there was a huge fight like screaming match bc MIL was pissed bc my mother was in the labor & delivery room over her (MIL) (which is just ridiculous to me) and has gotten mad over my youngest child bc the child did not smile at her (MIL).

I initially went to an ivy league school, but due to a serious lapse in judgement, I performed very poorly. I spent 2 years there, slowly falling worse and worse into depression before deciding to leave for my mental health. My parents were not very pleased with me when this happened (understandably) and my father forcibly enrolled me in his university (he’s a tenured professor at a school with a TERRIBLE program for what I’m studying.) I truly hated being there and didn’t take it seriously in the slightest (not submitting assignments, not studying for tests, etc.)

That year I was at my father’s university was the year covid hit the fan, so I finished off the year and took an indefinite leave of absence from school. I spent 3 years essentially wasting my life before coming to the realization that I really needed to just get my bachelor’s. My father’s university is free to me due to the faculty benefits and would allow me to graduate in just 1 year. So, last fall I begrudgingly re-enrolled in my dad’s university. 

The semester is ending and there have been lots of events for graduating seniors; all of which I have refused to attend. I’m not attending the graduation ceremony either. I keep seeing posts about being proud of this incredible accomplishment but I’m simply not. I’m not proud of myself for getting a degree worth dogshit from this joke of an institution. I know it sounds ungrateful because anyone would be ecstatic to attend college for free, but I’m genuinely ashamed of myself for getting my bachelor’s at the age of 25 from a school you should truly only attend if it’s your only choice. 

My mother is very upset that I’m not going to graduation ceremony. She keeps telling me I’ll regret it but I think she’s just upset she can’t take pictures. I know that if I did go (which I can’t because I already told them not to send me a cap and gown), I would be miserable and it would be nothing but a terrible memory to look back on. I just want to finish, get the degree, move on with my life, and never look back. 

My mother believes that I’m making this situation worse for myself by refusing to do all the graduation stuff everyone looks forward to. Today was my last day of classes and when I came home (yes I moved back in with my parents), I was greeted by a huge group of my extended family in our living room congratulating me on finishing my degree. I immediately stormed out and went out to the car and drove off. I went to a random shopping center and cried in the parking lot. I received several texts from my mom saying what I did was incredibly rude and I shouldn’t have ignored our family like that. I’m currently writing this in the car and wondering if I should even go home or if I should just crash at a friend’s house because I’m so upset.

Today was my last day of classes and when I came home (yes I moved back in with my parents), I was greeted by a huge group of my extended family in our living room congratulating me on finishing my degree. I immediately stormed out and went out to the car and drove off. I went to a random shopping center and cried in the parking lot. I received several texts from my mom saying what I did was incredibly rude and I shouldn’t have ignored our family like that. I’m currently writing this in the car and wondering if I should even go home or if I should just crash at a friend’s house because I’m so upset.

66,1cdx2yc,AITA for ruining family vacation plans?,"AITA for ruining family vacation?

Important background: My MIL is 85. She has always been kind to me, and I respect and love her. FIL passed away a few years ago, and she lives alone but stays busy with friends. We live a 6-hour flight away from her and see her 2x each year.

The issue: MIL announced last year that she would like us all to take a 2-week trip over Christmas to have a family reunion in her birth country. She said she and FIL always wanted to do this, she wasn’t sure she’d be able to travel much longer given her age, and she will pay all costs for all the grandchildren. This is a lot of money for her.

I am not enthusiastic. It will still cost a lot of $ for flights for my husband and I, and require us to use most of our leave from work for the year. (We both work full time.) Also, we have a 3.5 yo child, which makes the logistics of the trip difficult; my energetic kid simply cannot sit still and behave for the 15-hr flight, plus another 3-hr drive to the destination after we land. The time zone difference will throw off Kiddo too, and I know that I’ll end up telling my husband to go have fun with his family while I stay behind with multiple toddler tantrums. Then, when we get home, we’ll have to readjust Kiddo all over again, so realistically it will cost more time off work. 

My husband has mixed feelings. He loves and enjoys his family and doesn’t want to disappoint his mom, but he knows this trip will be hard for us. He is a people pleaser, and both his mom and I have strong personalities, so he probably does not want to upset either of us. I told my husband he should just go alone, but he doesn’t want to do that because then he would miss Christmas with his wife and kid. 

He told MIL we’d love to do a family reunion trip closer to home, and we’d pay our own way, but that this particular trip would not be feasible for us while Kiddo is so young. She cried and said she’s already paid for the hotels. He offered to pay her back for our share (although we never agreed to this plan or had a say in the hotel, etc), but she refused. We know it’s not really about the money, she is sad the trip will not be happening as she hoped. 

My husband then called his sister to tell her that we are not going, and his sister said that if we are not going, then her family (husband and 2 older kids) will not go either, as it is too much of a $ and time commitment for what will not actually be a family reunion without us. She lives near her mom and plans to tell her mom this weekend. I know this will devastate MIL. 

I think I may be TA for causing a generous older woman who has always been kind to me to cry. And for inadvertently causing others to pull out of her dream trip, too.

68,1cdwsex,AITA for not wanting my roommate's partner over all the time?,"I know this question has been asked a bunch, but I'm almost at my breaking point in terms of what I can tolerate. I've been living with my roommate for a few years now and things have been really good up until a few months ago. We're both close friends and have grown a lot together, but their partner has been coming over frequently and it's started to annoy me more over time.

I'm in the office multiple times a week so I don't get much time to rest and relax in the apartment unless it's the weekend or I work from home. I prefer to have my space to reset, but when there's a third person, it feels like I have to be on my guard and I can't fully relax. Our apartment is small so when they take up the living room, I have to lock myself in my room and isolate. This has happened more times than I've wanted and it's made me feel like a third wheel in my own space. The partner lives less than a 5 minute walk away with a much bigger space so I don't understand why they aren't there more often.

The other thing that really upsets me is that the partner doesn't knock before entering the apartment. Sometimes the door will be unlocked and even if my roommate warns me that they're coming, it upsets me that they walk in before knocking. I do like the partner and think they're great, but more tension has been building since they started taking up more space in the apartment.

I will admit that any time he comes over, I tend to give the silent treatment because I start to get annoyed and then my heart starts racing / I get upset when they enter unannounced.

I've talked to my roommate about it and it felt like they understood where I was coming from, but after some time, it went to the same routine of 3-5 times a week that they'd be over. Sometimes I feel like I'm the asshole for being visibly annoyed whenever the partner comes by, but I also feel like I have a right to the space that I pay rent for.

During this last bell ceremony, graduating class dance a waltz and my cousin was pretty excited for it.

My cousin is been very upset about this and ready to complain to the school board about letting them have this last bell ceremony since she wanted to dance that Walts for as long as she remembers.

Third of all, this is a throwaway account because, though I doubt I'll end up making a main account later, I don't want this tied to it if I do.

I (15F) lost my mother two years ago at 13. It was really hard for me because we were so close. I still haven't really gotten over it. My large friend group knows of my loss, but they assume I've gotten over it. The issue here is that they keep making ""your mom"" jokes (my friend Sam especially) and every time it makes me emotional.

At one point when we were all at the arcade, Sam kept making more and more ""your mom"" jokes. No one thought it was funny. I had gotten to my limit, and I told Sam that the next time he made another ""your mom"" joke I would write an extremely detailed story about doing it with his mom, since I consider myself a pretty decent writer. He just laughed and forgot about it. He later made yet another ""your mom"" joke.

I became incredibly angry and said I'd better go home since it was getting pretty late. After I went home, I wrote probably the most detailed story ever about how I did it with his mom. I don't even know what that really looks like, so I had to guess.

About a week later, we went to the arcade again. At the very beginning of the party, I told Sam ""I have a surprise for you!"" and when he read it, his jaw dropped to the floor. I almost laughed. Then, he turned beet red and I think he started to cry. He said mostly nothing for the rest of the time we were there.

74,1cdvpgf,AITA for wanting my friend to stay mad at her friend?,"So me, F (16) and my friend, who we'll call N, have been friends for years. I trust her, and I know she does too. She's kind, fun and sometimes worries a bit much, but I wouldn't change her. 

We are part of a big friend group. In said friend group there's this girl, who we'll call L. L and N are also very good friends. They often have sleepovers and spend a lot of time together.

L and me are not really friends. We'd both choose another person before choosing eachother. Her personality is a bit too much for me. She's a bit rude, she's annoying and too direct. She criticizes people a lot and she often does some ""jokes"" that I don't really find funny. So yeah, were not close, but I don't dislike her. 

Anyways, in class N sits in the middle between L and me, and has been spending every class for the past month or so talking to L. She jokes with her and is often distracted because of talking to L. Sometimes, because of this, a I feel a bit left out.

Two days ago, L got mad at N for ""ignoring"" her. N doesn't really respond to text messages, and she doesn't like listening to long audios. Anyone who knows her knows this. It's like basic knowledge. So L got mad at N because N didn't listen to her 8 minutes long audios (yeah, plural)

Since L got mad at her, N has been paying more attention to me. She makes jokes, and is acting just as how things were before L started joining our friend group. She listens to me and helps me when I don't understand something. It makes me feel glad that L and N are not talking. 

Now, L and N have been resolving things quietly, and N is slowly paying more attention to L. She still cares about her when mad and wants to resolve things as fast as possible. 

Now, I know people can have as many friends as they want to. I don't care if L and N are friends. Seriously, great for them. But I would appreciate if N payed the same attention to her than to me. Especially when we're sitting in a group of 3 in class. I haven't told this to anyone, because I feel like if I'm exaggerating.

Two days ago, L got mad at N for ""ignoring"" her. N doesn't really respond to text messages, and she doesn't like listening to long audios. Anyone who knows her knows this. It's like basic knowledge. So L got mad at N because N didn't listen to her 8 minutes long audios (yeah, plural)

Since L got mad at her, N has been paying more attention to me. She makes jokes, and is acting just as how things were before L started joining our friend group. She listens to me and helps me when I don't understand something. It makes me feel glad that L and N are not talking. 

Now, L and N have been resolving things quietly, and N is slowly paying more attention to L. She still cares about her when mad and wants to resolve things as fast as possible. 

Now, I know people can have as many friends as they want to. I don't care if L and N are friends. Seriously, great for them. But I would appreciate if N payed the same attention to her than to me. Especially when we're sitting in a group of 3 in class. I haven't told this to anyone, because I feel like if I'm exaggerating.

So, AITA for wanting my friend (N) to be mad at her friend (L)? I care about her, but I probably shouldn't want anyone to be mad, since it has only brought sadness to N.",1.0,1.0470165014266968,1,1
75,1cdvijg,AITA for swearing at my sister,"Just a heads up we're not the most mentally stable family.

  I am 19 and my sister is 30. We currently live together. This past 2 weeks I had to borrow her car almost every day to take my dog to the vet. My dog is 10 years old and recently got an emergency surgery so she needed serious care.
  My sister is very protective of her things which I understand. We are not the most fortunate. If something breaks down it won't be easy to find money to fix it. Every day when I came home from the vet visit she asked me ""what did you break"" which was quite infuriating but whatever.
  A couple of days ago I was at Uni and she called me. She yelled at me on the phone, asking what I did to her car. Apparently the thing that shows how much fuel you have didn't work. I told her I didn't do anything and the car was fine the day before. She kept screaming and told me not to touch her things anymore and I destroy everything I touch. That was very hurtful. She hung up and I texted her and told her that I had no reason to lie. Then she went off about how irresponsible I am.  I told her to shove that car up her ass.
  My sister hates swearing so she started yelling at me calling me rude and threatening to tell our dad (he's pretty chill but doesn't like swearing either).
  I went at my dad's place that day. My younger sister also yelled at me over the phone. My aunt is talking to me in a very passive-agressive tone. My dad is chill but he compared me to my alcoholic and abusive grandfather (on my moms side) which I Don't think is fair.
  I don't see how my words are any more hurtful than hers. I knew how much she hated swearing and I still did it. She knew how much I struggle with self worth and trust yes still said that to me. I think we're equally at fault here but everyone seems to disagree.
  The Car is fine, there's nothing wrong with it. I'm still staying at my dad's place. I am really worried. I love her. She raised me and my younger sister and I am very grateful but we don't have a good relationship. I offered to go to therapy with her (i go on my own) but she refused. AITA?

She was so mad she was shaking and her face was beat red. She screamed in my face so loud that she spat on me. “WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO CLEAN UP YOURE MESSES”.

We have a cleaning service to help my mom, I pay half and dad pays half. 

To pay for something for my brother, my mother took a loan with her car as guarantee 2 years ago. She was paying it as she could before I moved here. But since I moved here, I been paying this for her. It is a 17% of my income. My brother has not helped her not even for ONE payment, mind you, there were like 50 payments.

I feel bad for telling her that in that way, but I also feel like I’m the one being pressured the most, financially I’m the worst standing (brother is making 3 times my income, and my dad is making like 10 times that).

83,1cdtwbe,AITA for failing to contribute to my sister's cat food?,"Ever since I (M23) could remember, my sister (22) always wanted a cat. Eventually, my mom relented and we got one about 5 years ago, when I was 18 or so. From the off, it was made clear that this would be my ""sister's cat"" and it was conditioned on the idea that she would pay for cat food, cat litter, toys, and everything along those lines.

We got Spot and I do love her. I was never a massive cat person beforehand, but I am fond of having her in the house. 

However, the past few months since we've returned from college, my sister has struggled to afford cat food. She's a pretty compulsive spender, so I'd attribute that to it partly, but she doesn't have a job post-college. As such, she's struggling to make it work and it looks like we could have to lose Spot. I come from a single parent household and my mom struggles, so isn't able to contribute either.

I have a lot of savings and my sister has asked me to help out. I told her that it was clear that Spot was her responsibility and she should be smarter with her purchases/money knowing she has a cat to care for. She called me an asshole for not helping, saying I spent time with Spot and had the money to assist.

While that is true, I don't feel it's my responsibility to do so. AITA for not helping out given I also spend a great deal of time with Spot, or am I right in my stance?

We never solidified a time but it was still a couple hours away and would obviously be taking place around dinner (anywhere between 5-7).

My other friend Kate messaged me out of the blue on my way home asking if I wanted to go on a quick walk to get her toddler out of the house and catch up since I hadn’t seen her in months. Kate and I have been friends since childhood and we message each other regularly but rarely see each other in person because of our chaotic lives. So when she messaged me I was really happy and thought I would have time since Sara and Mary had plans to do their own thing. I tried to contact Sara to let her know to come later but my phone doesn’t like to send texts in the grocery store for some reason so I called her as soon as I got home. Well turns out she and her friend had already left and had used the 30 min walk to my place as their daily walk. They were at the grocery store 2 blocks away with a giant bag of food. Obviously this wasn’t gonna work with Kate so I try calling and when she doesn’t answer I text her saying there’s been a mix up and Sara is already at my place and she needs to call me before she leaves. She answers saying she’s almost ready so I confirm with her through text (didn’t answer my call again) that she saw my message and if she’s planning to join us for dinner which she is 100% welcome to. 

She finally calls me once she’s packed up in the car to tell me she’s on her way. I told her I can’t anymore because Sara and Mary assumed they should just come over once I was done work, which is a fair assumption on their part even if we hadn’t discussed a specific time and since my text never went through I wasn’t able to contact her before they left her house. 

Kate was really upset and started crying because she thought I was going to tell them to go home and come back later and I was ditching her for other friends. This was triggering for her because I’m childhood there was a few instances where people wanted to be friends/hang out with me and not her and I would still continue my friendship with them.

87,1cdt8gx,AITA for yelling at my 'family' for suddenly wanting me in their lives?,"For some backstory, I (26F) am a product of my father's affair.

My three half siblings, Jacob (36M), Lily (32F), and Helen (30F) have never wanted anything to do with me, and at first my father didn't either.

When I was around six, though, my mother died. Nobody wanted an affair baby, so I ended up living with my father and his family after all. I was treated differently, like a guest in their home. I could tell my father resented me for ruining his family.

I tried my best to make my siblings like me, hoping they'd warm up to me eventually, but they made it clear they never wanted a relationship.

I know reddit is generally forgiving of people like my siblings, and that's fine. I get it, they don't have to want a relationship with the brat who tore their family apart. But once I got over trying to beg for their love, I began to hate them.

They had two living parents who actually wanted them, college funds, toys, therapy, and siblings who loved them. I had *none* of that. My father hated me, he barely spent a cent on me, my mother was dead, and they all wanted nothing to do with me, but I was the monster for just being born.

It's taken years to accept that I was unwanted by my siblings, but I got through it. I got myself through life, into college, into a good apartment and (very well paying) job I love.

Recently, though, Lily reached out to me. Apparently, she's pregnant. She says becoming a mother ""made her realize how important family is"", so she wants me in her- and the child's- life.

I admit, I wasn't very cordial. I asked harshly why I'd want a relationship with the people who abandoned and rejected me for so many years?

Lily said her baby was innocent in all this, and that I owed my nephew a relationship. I admit, I lost it at that, and I ended up screaming at her. Her baby's innocent in this? Where was that attitude when I lost my fucking mom and my entire remaining family rejected me at six years old?!? Where was that attitude when I practically *begged* for their love for years?!?

I screamed at Lily that I don't know why she suddenly wants me in her life- whether it's money for the baby or to ease her own guilt- but that she made this bed and now I'd make damn sure she lies in it.

Since then I haven't heard from Lily, but Helen and Jacob have been trying to contact me to call me a monster for screaming at my own pregnant sister.

I don't feel bad for not wanting a relationship, but admittedly, I lost it a little bit, and now I feel like screaming at Lily may have been too far, especially since stress probably isn't good for the baby. I don't know, am I the asshole here? I feel like I might be.

ETA: Answering a few questions I saw in the comments (i answered the comments directly too but figured they'd be relevant info here)

1.) Did Lily apologize? Kinda. She said she regretted rejecting me, but she brushed past it quickly and right into talking about other things, which made me feel like she expected forgiveness to be a given and made the whole thing feel insincere to me. I also never directly heard the words ""I'm sorry"" from her, so y'know.

2.) Why did I take her call in the first place? To be honest, I thought there was some kind of emergency going on, like that my father was dying or something. I genuinely couldn't see any other reason she'd be calling me. The last time I saw her was when I was 18 and she was 24 and she was mocking me for how I'd have to move out and ""finally stop leeching off her dad"", so I genuinely didn't see any reason to think she'd be contacting me for anything short but a life or death situation.

  
BRIEF UPDATE: 

I've been thinking a lot as I watch the comments roll in. Thank you for all your support, both to the people saying I did nothing wrong and to the people gently suggesting I apologize or that it might be good to mend ties. I don't think I'm comfortable having much of a relationship with Lily. She was cruel to me for my entire childhood for things beyond my control, and I can't just get over that, nor am I impressed with her one sentence apology. 

However, I keep thinking about my future nephew, and, well..while Lily may be a hypocrite, she's right that this baby is innocent, and I refuse to reject this child for what his mother did. I refuse to be like my siblings or my mother's family in that way. So I've made a decision. 

I'm going to reach out to Lily and apologize for yelling first and foremost. Then I'm going to make her a deal. I'll take her child out on auntie/nephew days, give her money if he needs anything (under the condition that she provides proof of purchase), and potentially attend family events if he's present. However, if she at any point insults me or blames me for what our father did, I'm going to cut her out again. I'm also going to start putting money into a college/life fund for him (under my name, not lily's. this is for the child to access when he turns eighteen, not for her to spend.) and any of her other future children. I'll make the same deal to my other siblings if they have children as well.

Some of you may be upset I don't want a close relationship with Lily and only want to see her child. Some of you may be upset I want to be in my nephew's life at all. But I want to do right by him.

88,1cdsvn3,AITA for asking my sister to vacuum?,"The week before my wedding was pretty stressful. I had a million things to do and most of them were things I needed to do myself.

My now husband had to drive a 6 hour return trip to pick his parents up from the airport. They had never been to our house before so I wanted it to look nice. 

My sister, who was also my maid of honour, asked what I needed help with. As most of the specific wedding jobs were things I needed to do myself, I said it would be great if she could quickly run the vacuum over the house for me before my future in-laws arrived.

The week before my wedding was pretty stressful. I had a million things to do and most of them were things I needed to do myself.

My now husband had to drive a 6 hour return trip to pick his parents up from the airport. They had never been to our house before so I wanted it to look nice. 

My sister, who was also my maid of honour, asked what I needed help with. As most of the specific wedding jobs were things I needed to do myself, I said it would be great if she could quickly run the vacuum over the house for me before my future in-laws arrived.

90,1cdsbdd,AITA My wife blames me when she’s late…,"AITA? I’m confused. My wife and I both work. No kids. When we wake up in the morning, it naturally takes her a good bit longer to get ready. Women have the added pressure of putting on makeup and are sometimes judged more on their appearance than men. Not saying it’s fair. Wife just likes to look good for the day and that’s how she chooses to do it.

Anyway, I get up when I need to be on time for work. I’m lucky it takes me less time and it’s not her fault it takes her longer. But even if I’m standing by the door ready to go in the morning (we drive together), she still blames me for us running behind. The time for us to leave will come and go so sometimes I have to call an Uber and leave her the car or vice versa. When I ask if she’s about ready or if I should go she gets mad when she’s not ready. I’m not trying to badger her but I need to know what the situation is. I have a job too. She might be late but it shouldn’t make me late.

When we talk about this her repeated argument is that she stays in bed longer than she should because I don’t get up when she needs to be up. I tell her to set a separate alarm and to get up whenever she needs so she can get ready and be on time. It’s not like I’m sitting around while she makes me breakfast or something I could do for her to lighten the load - at least I genuinely can’t think of anything that would help. When I asked she said it would help if I got up earlier so it would motivate her to get up too. That just seems ridiculous to me though. Get up and do what? Force her out of bed?

I (23F) began dating my boyfriend (then 19) when I was about to turn 19. My parents strongly opposed this, and my mother even attempted to forbid me from seeing him. For context, there is nothing ""wrong"" with my boyfriend. He comes from a well-behaved family, excelled in school (top of every student), and is an overall nice and sweet person – which my parents were well aware of. Despite this, they didn't want me to be with him. It felt unfair because my brothers dated girls without my parents interfering. This upset me very much, so I distanced myself from the family. Over time, my parents accepted my boyfriend, and after 3.5 years, he was welcomed into their home.  
  
Fast forward to now, we are expecting a child together. We've always wanted kids, and even though this pregnancy wasn't planned, we were certain we wanted to keep it. I confided in my mother before the 12-week mark because I was scared and just needed her support. I trusted her to keep it a secret and was honest about everything. However, she was not happy with the situation and found it very stressful that I was pregnant. So she informed my two brothers and my father.  
  
My older brother decided to call me, and it turned into a 45-minute-long conversation where he tried to convince me to abort my child. He also wanted to speak with my boyfriend, but I firmly refused. I endured the call only because I didn't want to escalate the situation further. I feared that hanging up or expressing my frustration would only add to the drama, which I couldn't handle at the time.  
  
The following day, my younger brother called me, and while our conversation was more neutral, he also suggested that I ""really think about it,"" which angered me. Alot. After our discussion, he texted my boyfriend, asking to speak with him without telling me, fearing I would feel attacked. Well, my boyfriend and I don't keep secrets from each other and it was me who saw to meassage (we always inform each other about messages because again, no secrets). When I informed my boyfriend about the message, he was upset. He responded, telling my brother that he had crossed a line and asked for privacy. The response he received was dismissive, stating, ""sorry, you feel that way.""  
  
The next day, I texted my mother and brothers, expressing how wrong their actions were and how embarrassed they made me feel in front of my boyfriend. Unfortunately, I received no response, except from my younger brother, who singled out the word ""embarrassing"" in my text, seemingly mocking me.  
  
The next day, my mother called me to express her disappointment with how I handled the situation with my brothers. She felt bad for them and defended them. I was so sad and felt once again treated differently.

She's upset and telling me to quit my job so I can go and ""just find another one later"". 

 I saved up for the trip, but I obviously need my job to pay my rent, food, etc. I don't even have that much money in savings so as to survive while I job hunt without eating up my small emergency fund if I were to take the bad decision (in my opinion) to quit so I can go.

I get graduations are an important event but it just didn't work out for me to attend. Since I couldn't go I opted to send a nice graduation gift and flower arrangement to congratulate her. This feels like a dumb question because I don't think it's reasonable to ask someone to quit their job and impact their livelihood, but she's so adamant that I'm being a shitty friend that I'm self doubting my reasoning.

94,1cds0se,AITA for wishing my friend has fallen out with his other friends?,"My (17F) friend (17M) has been acting strangely to me over the last year. He's never met up with me outside school. He won't give me his number -- I have his IG but he takes 3-5 business days to reply so I can't actually message anything important/urgent. We've been friends for 2 years but I don't have a single photo with him in it. I know nothing about his family, his life before he joined our school, his friends from outside of school, anything. Sometimes its like he's a ghost, but he is a good laugh and we get along so well people think we're dating. 

He has a group of other friends that I'm 'not allowed' to join in with. I get cut out of conversations with them, and they all start speaking in code like they're 10. Even in class, I sit with him and one of the girls from this group and they both act like they've never met me before. We've had several teachers tell him to stop talking to these other friends in classes, and some have told me that they know I'm dragging him and whoever he's talking with along because otherwise neither of them would pass. 

When he chooses to hang out with these friends, he won't tell me. Sometimes I'm babysitting his bag for 2 hrs whilst I study and he's with them. Sometimes he'll make direct eye contact and then turn around and leave the room. I've told him before to just tell me he's going and to give a rough timeframe of when how long he'll be gone so I can plan my time better (e.g. if he's going to be gone 10 mins, I'll just go on my phone, if he's gone all afternoon, I'll write some essays). He won't do that.

I've also learnt that all the things I've not had (his #, photos, meeting up) this group have had. For context, they also bullied me horrendously for a year and drove me to mental health breaks from school and counselling. He knows this, and knows that I want to be civil with them but can't be friends with them at the same time. 

I've often just thought he was stringing me along and sometimes I've wanted to just turn my back on him but then he'll spend a whole fortnight acting like I'm his only friend. 

TIL that this group is fracturing and people in that group dislike him for some reason or another. I used it to my advantage and when he was expecting to hang out with me, I just went and did my own thing elsewhere to try and prove to him that you can't toy people about, you need to appreciate that they have feelings. My history with that group has also made me more paranoid about people falling out with me, and I'm more conscious than ever about what people think. Every 5 mins he's with them without warning, I assume he's decided I'm a horrific person. (it's not great, that's why I have therapy!) He knows this, and I've articulated that many times.

He started with a few of shots. I didn't really wanted shots but it already arrived and I kinda feel obliged to drink the shots. But he keep to secretly order shots and after the 5th shot I told him that he needed to stop ordering them. I wasn't planning to get drunk and just wanted to have a great time. He told me he got all that alcohol, because that will give us a great time. I was a bit confused at first but I think he wanted me to get completely drunk. Maybe that's what he thinks is fun or maybe he wanted to do something, but I told him that it wasn't my way of having fun and I won't drink any more alcohol.

She then sent a message to the mom of my friend and the mom sent a quite rude message to me, even though I knew what was wrong with the horse (I was on multiple vetchecks and appointments with a experienced vet so I was there with her when she got the horse’s “diagnosis”). The mom has no experience with horses at all, and my friend is on my side. What should i do next? And am i the a-hole?",1.0,0.014969924464821815,0,0
97,1cdrjn0,AITA for using a serving dish that was cracked when I purchased it then going back to the store to exchange it?,"This honestly seems like a no-brainer to me, but I never worked retail so who knows maybe there's something I don't realize.  
Basically, my wife had me purchase an expensive serving dish for a party we were hosting. I went to a small giftware store & picked a large oval tray that had inserts. It came in a sealed box.  
Shortly before the party in the evening, my wife opened the box & immediately called me over to show me that there was a large crack running down one of the sides of the bowl. Since it was a large serving dish with inserts, it was still usable, & still looked nice with the inserts in it.  
My wife was upset but unfortunately the store was already closed.  
I said just take some clear packing tape and just tape the side of the dish where the crack is. Use it with the inserts, I'll take it back to the store the next day.  
I'm not the type of person who returns things in general, even if I buy it just for the party I'm not the type who would return it, and I never intended to return it for cash anyway just to be clear, I would have just wanted them to exchange it for a not broken one. I'm not really sure any of that makes a difference, they sold me a cracked dish, but just in case it does I'm putting it out there.  
At any rate, I returned to the store the next day with my broken dish and showed it to the clerk and said hi I was just here yesterday and purchased this, she did not argue the point, but when she took out the dish and saw the inserts were dirty and the dish had a piece of tape on it she looked at me very accusatorily and said hey it looks like you used this.  
I said yes, we did use it. I was confused what difference that would make. She said, we can't take this back once it's been used. I looked at her in total bemusement. I was like, are you serious right now? What difference does it make if it's used? Were you planning on selling it to someone else?  
I still can't figure out what difference it would have made. What was the store going to do with a cracked dish? Obviously it would either have to be discarded or returned to whatever they got it from for whatever amount they get back whatever the deal is with their distributors who they purchase from. Honestly I don't care how it works on the back end. I just don't see why my having used the dish would have made any difference to the ethicality of me returning it.  
So she calls the manager who also gave me a hard time they were discussing whether or not they had to call the owner of the store. It's a small store, and the owner does keep an eye on things and come in from time to time, and then finally the manager decided she had the authority to make this decision and reluctantly, while giving me some serious side eye, she gave the clerk the go ahead to do an exchange.  
I walked out of there feeling like maybe I was the bad guy. I don't know, it does not seem like I did anything wrong. But I don't know I decided to post it here and see what the power of the internet decides.

Edit: I will add from the comments I gather two things, first of all I should have cleaned it before I returned it. I guess I was wrong for doing that I accept that. second of all I should have mentioned that I did take a picture of it with the sticker still on when it was brand new with the crack so I could show them that it wasn't me, and I did show them that picture so they knew that they sold me a cracked item, that much I did and I should have mentioned that.

I (16F) was hanging out with my friend in my room and my little brother (4yo) came to my door. I let him in, I was so happy cus normally he’s super shy and don’t talk around strangers. We were having chocolate and I knew he wanted some because he’s been eyeing the chocolate lol. I asked him if he wants chocolate and he nodded* his head. I told him to “look me in the eye and say yes” I did this because this is like a rule my parents set up, they wanna teach him answering questions verbally / looking at peoples eyes when they speak. 

Whatever back to moment he just yes I said no look me in the eye, then my friend get involved and said I shouldn’t force him and I’m being a bad sister. I started explaining her the rule, we got into a little conflict. My brother ran away. We followed him around and found him crying. I told my friend to go back to room. I calmed my brother, kissed him, gave him chocolate. Everything was fine , he even thanked me directly looking at my face:) 

But when I went back to my room my friend blamed me for making him cry for a stupid rule, I told her no he actually probably cried because of her involvement. Like he probably got overwhelmed with her questioning and my answering and thought we were arguing or sth. He’s already a shy , sensitive kid and not used to seeing conflict. Plus this is a rule my parents set up. My friend said “so what? You don’t have to follow it when they’re not around ” this conflict went on for a bit then we changed topic.

99,1cdqu6l,AITA for trying to call my friends out on not being great friends?,"
I (21 F) have had a friend group of 3 other people for about a year now who I’ve hung out with a lot. Let’s call them Stacy, Jim and Greg. 

Things were great near the beginning, but I noticed the past 4 months that none of them reach out to me anymore through text. Like, they’re supposed to be my good friends and literally never text at all. I have to be the first one to reach out, and even then it’s rare that I get a response that isn’t 1 word. I have no idea what caused this, maybe they just got tired of me? And when we all hang out in person, sometimes it’s like I’m not even there. Stacy literally started talking about plans she made with Jim and Greg that I wasn’t invited to, and I was sitting right there. It just felt awful. There are many other examples of these small things but that’s something that stands out right now. 

Whenever I try to talk in the group or tell a funny story, they just look at me with blank stares and hardly react. When anyone else does the same thing it’s all laughter. It just feels strange at this point. I’ve even tried giving them all gifts to see if that would make anything better, and they seemed grateful for the gifts, but nothing really changed.

I tried talking to Jim about it after finally getting the courage to say how I’ve been feeling (I didn’t want to cause problems). I told him how maybe I talk too much or something so they began to feel annoyed by me? Idk. Jim is the most cool of the 3, so I felt like he’d be the best one to admit this to. He basically responded by telling me that he doesn’t know what I’m talking about, but if I feel like Stacy and Greg have been treating me this way, maybe I should promise to change and not talk so much and that could make things better. 

I thought about what he said for a moment but then I thought, I don’t think I want to change who I am. I truly do care for all three of them, but I don’t think changing who I am is the answer here. It just doesn’t feel right I guess. I’m probably just going to let it drop here, I don’t want to say anything more about it to any of them. If they reach out to me great, if they don’t, well, there’s nothing else I can really do about that. 

But, I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for potentially being paranoid and maybe causing issues here. Although they’ve been treating me maybe not great, maybe I should just be quiet about it for the sake of peace. 

Btw if anyone needs more info on this to make a judgement please feel free to comment and I’ll answer any questions.

100,1cdqm8r,AITA for going to a concert with other people?,"Hi there, 

To start, I feel horrible about this entire situation and don't know how to feel, so I'm looking for some clarity. My best friend and I always go to concerts together. We tend to text or call while tickets are going on sale, so we're on the same page with seating/pricing. 

This time around, we talked about a concert we wanted to go to a week before the pre-sale. It was a concert I knew my other friends, including their mutual friends, wanted to go to because we all liked the artist. We talked about it ONCE that week and then never again; honestly, I had forgotten about it. I even saw my friend who was also interested in going the day before, and neither of us brought it up because we legit forgot. 

The next morning (the morning of the pre-sale), my friend I saw the day before messaged me to ask if I wanted to be in a group chat to get tickets with their other 2 friends. I said yes and to include my best friend. This was an hour before the pre-sale. I had a meeting for work at 9:30, and by the time I got off, it was 9:55, so I rushed to make sure I was in the waiting room for tickets. My best friend hadn't responded to me or my other friend and I was worried about her getting a ticket. 

One of the girls in the group chat got to the seats before any of us and grabbed tickets for us. Again, my best friend still wasn't answering. I was unsure whether to ask this girl to grab another ticket for my best friend, considering I didn't know her very well. In the end, we all got the tickets. 

Two hours later, my friend asked if we got them, and she had just woken up. I felt so bad and told her we did. Fast-forward to today, and she lets me know she's upset with me because we had talked about going, and I now am going with ""these random other people."" However, again, we talked about wanting to go to the concert, but we never talked about it after that. I only remembered because my other friend reminded me, and I was only up because of work. 

I feel like she lacks accountability because we're all adults, and if you know you have something you really want to go to/attend, maybe put an alarm. I didn't grab a ticket for her because, again, we never discussed pricing, and I didn't want to assume she was going to be able to afford the seats we got. 

Overall, I think it was all poorly planned and we can all take accountability for where we went wrong but I genuinely was so wrapped up in the fact that we all forgot about it and she feels like she wasn't considered, even though we all had just remembered in the morning because of the pre-sale text that was sent out. To me, it feels like moving forward we just need to have better communication when we have events we want to attend and check in with each other more because neither of us did. (Again, I had just totally forgotten about it and I'm sure she did as well, which highlights the point of it being poorly planned).

101,1cdqck5,AITA for not wanting to share my birthday with my partner’s family?,"We see them twice a year which is holidays and during the summer which so happens to land on my birthday for the past 3 years.

They originally wanted to come down for one of their grandchildren’s birthdays but my partner will be away for work, and they naturally want to see both of them if they plan to fly.

I want my gift to be some alone time with him as he is gone a lot because of his type of work. As my partner only takes birthdays or holidays off, mine has been the most convenient for visiting. 

I understand we live far and family never gets to see us. I do not mind them coming to visit if it was any other day. They are nice and have taken me out to do things on previous birthdays (but we go out irregardless when we see them).

103,1cdpt2g,AITA for not wanting to continue my boyfriend’s family’s tradition,"My boyfriends family has a tradition in which any/all sons receive their father’s first name as a middle name (my husbands name is nathan therefor by tradition any of our sons would have the middle name nathan).

 Before I became pregnant I was aware of this tradition but didn’t think much of it and often gave my boyfriend a hard time for it cause I felt it was a little silly. We never discussed it openly in detail and whether I agreed or not (not sure if I had a choice to disagree). We did give our first son his dads name as his middle name. 

Now we are pregnant and due with our second boy in a couple months. Before we got pregnant a second time and again when I found out we were having another boy I asked my boyfriend to consider opting out of the tradition so our boys could have their own middle names. After some back and forth and discussion about why this tradition was truly important to my boyfriend, he has agreed to give our second born son a different middle name but his parents are not happy about it and making my boyfriend feel guilty for not carrying on the tradition and I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault

He cares a lot about his parents opinion and wants them to be happy. I want our sons to have their own middle names, I want them to be considered individuals and not just extensions of their dad and I and I think them sharing the same middle name doesn’t give them much uniqueness. My boyfriends parents think it’s selfish and rude of me to ask my boyfriend to deviate from this tradition that has been carried on, and I think our first born carrying on his dads middle name should be enough. Am I the asshole? 
",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"AITA for not wanting to continue my boyfriend’s family’s tradition My boyfriends family has a tradition in which any/all sons receive their father’s first name as a middle name (my husbands name is nathan therefor by tradition any of our sons would have the middle name nathan).

 Before I became pregnant I was aware of this tradition but didn’t think much of it and often gave my boyfriend a hard time for it cause I felt it was a little silly. We never discussed it openly in detail and whether I agreed or not (not sure if I had a choice to disagree). We did give our first son his dads name as his middle name.

104,1cdpnjx,AITA for saying no to picking up DH daughter so he can take her to truck fest?,"TLDR: husband wants me to drive a 4hour+ round trip to pick up his older daughter with our 3 month old baby so he can take her to truck fest. 

So little back story: me (34f) and DH(33m) have been together 7 years, married nearly 3. We are a blended family with my two kids, his two kids and our 3 month old baby. DH is a HGV driver and I am on maternity leave. His ex and kids live about 1.5 hours away if no traffic. 

DH has a ticket to go to truck fest next weekend with work. He wants to take his older daughter (11F) with him and she’s happy to go. Problem is that he will be working the Friday and then needs to clean his lorry cab ready to take up to the festival. He would then have to drive to get his daughter so they can go together and the group of them going will be leaving at about 5am or something like that. His mum won’t help with the pick up and his ex refuses to. 

My question is about me doing the journey. I don’t want to do it with the baby. Normally I would go do it before the baby but she is only 3 months old. I have to take my kids to their dads that evening anyway so it would be at least 4 hours in the car. 

She is exclusively breastfed and feeds around every 2 hours during the day with the odd 2-3 hour gap. During the day would be better but would obviously have to be after school/ early evening. This is also our baby’s grumpy part of the day where she cries more and just wants mummy cuddles and b00b. I’ve said I would do it if his ex would meet me half way but she doesn’t want to. 

I just can’t bring myself to put our baby in the car seat for that length of time (there isn’t really anywhere to stop and get her out to feed and stretch out on the route). If DH does the pick up he would get less sleep before having to do the 2-3 hour drive to the festival in the morning. 

WIBTA to stick to my instincts and say sorry but no? Again I would do it and have done it many times before even when they lived even further away so he could do other things. But I know long car journeys are no good for young babies and she will want feeding and to be out of the seat so will probably have to be left to cry until she wears herself out to sleep for most of the journey. Any suggestions? Help!

How does that make sense compared to what I did? Her client gave me a verbal okay, and how am I to know that means she couldn’t hear me. I said that if she is wondering where you are, then she should call her.

She said, “oh she’s not gonna do that.” So I have to be scolded? I believe I handled it just right, but Darla said I need to do it differently and made me feel like the asshole for sticking up for myself.

106,1cdp6hs,AITA For not being a talkative person,"I (F18) have always been a quiet and observant person. While I wouldn’t say I’m an introvert, I definitely let conversations flow naturally and oftentimes let other people start conversations before beginning to bounce topics back and forth.

My boyfriend (M19) cannot accept that this is how I live life. He thinks I’m just silent to only him and super talkative around my friends. While it is true that I definitely seem loud and outgoing around them, all of my friends and I will have periods of comfortable silence because my friends are very similar in the ideology that I have where conversations should just happen. 

My boyfriend pretty much never shuts up. Not that I don’t mind when he talks but there’s almost no breaks when he speaks for me to jump in and say anything, and when I do try to speak I often dont finish my thoughts. This is due to the fact he’ll either interrupt me, tell me Im interrupting him, or he’ll become focused on an ocd trigger.

I’ve explained to him before that when he just asks me to start talking I can’t do that because my mind blanks completely, and there’s a lot of things I’ve tried to tell him such as stories from my past that hes told me he doesnt want to hear because they involve my male friends.

He called me about 10 minutes ago asking if we could just chat and I agreed, and he did the thing where he just asked me to speak. He then asked if we were actually going to talk or if he was going to talk and I was just “going to sit there like a traffic cone.” I said I didn’t know what to talk about, and he began to get annoyed at me saying that I never do know.

He brought up the fact that when he called me while I was with my best friend he could barely have a conversation with me because her and I were joking and laughing too much. I explained again that prior to that call we had sat in silence for about an hour before one of us came up with a topic and we riffed from that. 

I find almost everyone in my life does this, where you riff off of what the other participants in the conversation say, but my boyfriend cannot understand that this is how you have a conversation and sometimes silence is okay. He’ll even occasionally get upset if we’re watching YouTube together and I’m not trying to say anything about the video and instead just watching it, because he’ll pause the video every like 10 seconds to comment. Once again this doesn’t bother me, but it just isnt how I exist.

He told me I needed to change this if I thought behaving this way was normal, and when I genuinely asked him how he told me “just change” like that gave me the tools to understand which way he wanted me to change. I ended up crying because I became overwhelmed at him raising his voice at me, and he got annoyed and mildly cussed me out before hanging up.

108,1cdov5o,AITA for lying to my girlfriend about buying her a car?,"Mckaila (22F) and I (25M) met in college and have been dating for several years. We have since both graduated and while she has struggled to find work in her degree field, together we are doing quite well. This bothers her a bit, since she is very independent and doesn’t like feeling like a burden. I do what I can to help her feel independent, but I also want to give her the life she deserves. We have found compromise in that she is okay with gifts because a gift has no strings attached.

This was really tested about a year ago when her car was totaled. She had no way to replace it and had to have a way to get to work and school daily. I let her borrow my car for a couple weeks while we figured out what we were going to do long term. 

I was happy for her to drive my car as long as she needed, but she hated it. Every day she felt like she was taking from me and giving nothing in return. I can and have named a hundred reasons why that’s not true, but she feels like that anyway.

One night she came home in tears and said she can’t handle being responsible for something that isn’t hers anymore. So we decided we would sit down and pick out a car online for her that night. After narrowing down her options, she fell in love with one that had low mileage and great fuel efficiency. When we went through pre-approval, her heart sank. The monthly payment was way out of her price range. 

I offered to split the payment and she immediately refused. She needed it to be her responsibility only. So I said okay, what if I buy it outright and make it a gift to you. She felt like I was mocking her. I told her I was serious and to at least sleep on it. We talked about it more in the morning and I reassured her that it would be 100% hers, that I wouldn’t sign anything and her name would be the only one on it. She reluctantly agreed. 

I told her I would finish up the forms online while she was at work and we could go pick it up together when it was ready. When I got to the final steps, I selected the monthly payments. I figured if she doesn’t know, she can’t feel bad about me making them. And if I ever needed to, I could pay it off immediately. 

We went to pick up the car and as soon as she saw it her reluctance turned to joy. She was ecstatic and I felt justified in my secret. Everything worked out perfectly. 

Fast forward to last week. She comes home visibly upset and before I can ask what’s wrong she throws the folder of her car’s paperwork down on the counter. I say what she already knows and confess that I have been making payments the past year. We get into a huge argument and she spends the night at her parents’ house. She has not come home since. 

I am prepared for this to be the end of our relationship, so I paid off the remainder of the loan yesterday.

109,1cdot4d,AITA for reporting a guy at my college because it seemed like he was creeping on girls?,"I’m a freshman going to a huge public college and I’ve enjoyed my time so far, but this problem just recently got way worse and I don’t know what to do about it.

Basically last semester my friends and I noticed that when we would be in a public place on campus, there would almost always be this specific guy there, he looked around our age and would always wear a hoodie, walk strangely, and stare at us profusely. There were about 3 separate times where we would be sitting at a table and he’d circle around it a few times making eye contact with us before walking away. He would always randomly be everywhere on campus, never just in his dorm and always staring at girls and walking near them.

I told my friend about this who lives in a separate dorm but is usually on campus and asked me what he looked like. I described him to her and she showed me a snapchat story from our school story that showed a girl asking about him, with a picture of him and explaining that he was being very creepy toward her. I had a conversation with the girl, who then told me that her entire friend group and multiple other girls have talked about him being very creepy toward them, following them back to their dorms, stealing their laundry from the communal room, staring at them and handing out “dating” flyers talking about how big his uknowwhat is. It disgusted me.

I proceeded to find his mother on facebook and sent her a message explaining the situation, because that would be better than immediately reporting him right? Wrong. She never responded and the behavior continued, and everytime I would see him he would follow closely behind me, and my friends, and would make creepy faces trying to hit on us when we obviously weren’t interested. So I gathered up as much info as I could and gave it to our dorm office who escalated it to Im assuming the college HR or something.

Nothing actually happened as a result of this, but this semester I’m assuming they finally contacted his mother and threatened suspicion because other girls continued to report him. A couple days ago I got a message from his mom on facebook, completely bitching me out, saying that her son is autistic and that it was unacceptable and horrible of me to report behavior that I saw as creepy but was actually just him being an autistic kid. I was horrified at the things she said, calling me an asshole and a terrible person, saying I was a bully to autistic students. I truly do feel like an ass, but there’s no way he doesn’t realize his behavior is wrong, he’s an adult he’s not stupid.

I recently moved back from my dorm and I was told that we would be sharing a room again. She was actually ok with the idea as the room is very spacious and I didn’t have that much stuff to bring to the room. 
 
Literally my first night back home - I woke up to her screaming on her phone and running around the room at 2 AM. I asked her politely to go downstairs or to please put on headphones and she apologized and put on headphones. I then fell asleep again and literally not even 30 min later she was laughing from the top of lungs so I gave up on sleeping and just went downstairs. 

I then decided to talk to my parents as this is something I was dealing with since high school and I just needed a different option then sharing a room with her until fall semester starts again. My parents also had enough of her screaming in the room every night as our walls are very thin and they decided to confront her about it (without me). She reacted exactly how they thought she would which was to freak out and act like people are wronging her. They decided to give her the option to leave and find an apartment or keep it down at night time and allow people to sleep. 

She apologized to my parents and they forgave her but she didn’t say anything to me and still screams until 5 AM but now I lowkey feel like it’s to spit me for telling my parents about everything.

Jesse was always like another son and brother in the family. He's known them basically his whole life and had a shitty childhood with his biological family so my ILs basically adopted him. He even lived with the family for a while. Because of this Jesse was always included as a member of the family as a unit and not just as an IL. Honestly Jesse is my MILs favorite child lol and I think he's the favorite brother of the family.

This was something I always knew. My husband was upfront about it when we dated. I know the rest of his siblings have been upfront with partners as well. I don't take it personally that Jesse is treated like a son/brother in the family but I'm a DIL and SIL. It makes sense to me. We don't have the same long history where they watched me grow up and I never lived with my husband's family.

Another BIL ""Frankie"" is married to ""Emma"". Of all the fellow ILs, Emma is the one who has a problem with Jesse being just another son/brother but us being more clear ILs. She has complained about it to a number of us fellow ILs. We've all explained that we're cool with it because we get Jesse has grown up with the family. Emma likes to vent to me a little more. I asked her once why she married Frankie if she was so bothered by it when I know he told her. She told me she had assumed that it was only at first and after a while everything was the very same. That she didn't really believe they called Jesse their son/brother and not SIL/BIL. And on she went whining about it. She heard Jesse was written into the will alongside the children (I don't know if true and I don't really care) and she was so outraged. 

It gets annoying. The others find it old too. Especially because she likes to get us alone to do this.

It was Joe and Jesse's birthday and everyone was celebrating and Emma decided to track me down to bitch about it some more and she really sounded like a child. I asked her to stop and she told me she needed to get it off her chest. I tried moving away but she walked and talked. Then I rolled my eyes and she was like omg stop being such a bitch and I told her I was tired of her whining. She told me I should be more understanding and supportive and us unwanted ILs need to stick together.

When he left she rushed in seemingly kind of flustered and I didn’t mention my conversation with him as I was still processing it and didn’t expect her to come in so suddenly.

That night at about 11pm I got an email from her suggesting I’m duplicitous and scheming for going behind her back and taking the studio from her that she was kind enough to sublet to me.

She has continued in this way - I bump into her frequently as she walks her dog near the studio. She is still apparently angry about the way I dealt with this over six months later and confronted me in the street today. I tried to remain calm but everything I say gets shot down and argued with.

She is convinced I’m a cruel and scheming person and I can’t help but question if I am? Though no one else in my life would say this about me!

115,1cdmthj,AITAH for wanting for keep my hobby car?,"Me (23m) and my partner (23f) are in a bit of a debate at the moment.

When I was younger I dreamt of having 2 types of car, either a 4x4 and a JDM sports car. I was lucky enough to find a really good condition 2007 Nissan patrol which was my dream choice.

I've spent countless hours and thousands of dollars in modifications to bring it from a bone stock car to a reasonably capable 4x4. I bought the car for 30k about 2 years ago and took out a 25k personal loan as well as having 11k as a deposit on the car. The idea was I would have 5k to get me started with modifications.

My partner and I started dating about 4 months after I got the car and our relationship moved rather quick. We both want to have kids when we are younger etc.

We first looked into renting a place together however due to the rental crisis in Australia at the moment we have really struggled to find somewhere as we both don't have any rental history. The next idea was to buy a house instead but due to the remaining amount on my loan it was discussed that in order to keep our timeline I would need to sell my beloved car.

Originally i agreed to the idea but as time moves on I am being to have 2nd thoughts. I am in the very fortunate position of having a fully maintained work vehicle so my 4x4 spends it's time sitting in the driveway.

I feel so guilty for wanting to keep it. It's for nothing but my own selfish reasons and not wanting to left go of it. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to get the car I've got again (as mentioned the specific 4x4 that I have is one of my absolute dream cars)

I just need to here other people's opinions.

I agreed as I did feel responsible, being the eldest of four and all. So my parents and three siblings were living in a two bedroom/ one bathroom apartment, and I worked my ass off in all aspects.

By then my mom had quit to be a stay at home mom, and me and my dad were the main bread winners (although my dad never wanted to give me credit for helping so much). Since I had good credit and work history, my parents were planing on having me buy a house for them to live in, and have me live in the basement until I could “maybe” move out.

117,1cdmknk,AITA for not arranging childcare when my husband was sick ? ,"Over the last 7 years I have been the primary caretaker for my husband’s and my 3 children (7,5,2). Through maternity leaves, and then working evenings or overnights, I am still the one who does the most childcare and household tasks. 

Whenever I was staying at home with the kids and was sick, my husband would just go about his routine as normal. He would leave without checking if I would need help for that day. There would be times when I was so ill I needed to call reinforcements, but I would arrange that. 

Recently, my husband got a job where he gets one weekday off. Today is his day off. I am working today and have several meetings and trainings that I need to attend. He has been messaging me non stop that he is sick. I told him that it’s his responsibility to arrange for care since he is the parent at home, as I had done many times, when I was home with our children. He has texted me WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU several times about me telling him he needs to make his own arrangements. I asked him several times if he had ever asked me if I needed help while sick. He keeps asking what is wrong with me. 

I don’t feel like I am the asshole because this is the same treatment he gives me but maybe I am ? 

****Edit: my husband wasn’t always like this. Our first two children were pretty equally cared for as well as the house. We used to work opposite shifts to each other so whoever was home was in charge of kids and chores. During my third pregnancy I was extremely ill, it’s also when my husband got a challenging physical labour job. With me being off on maternity leave for 18 months I feel like that’s when things really started to slide. When I went back to work I took evening or overnight shifts at a hospital while he started at 1pm. I almost went insane as he would not take the kids in the morning after an overnight and not let me sleep. I would be up all night and all day with them and was losing it. He kept complaining that he really didn’t like my overnight job because our youngest would still scream for me in the middle of the night. He mentioned me finding a day job, I said fine you try to find childcare in the area and after school care, let me know when you do. Obviously he couldn’t because wait lists are miles long in our area. 

I found a remote overnight job, which paid more and was more in line with my interests. That was fine except the same problems arose of him not respecting the need for sleep after an overnight (even for a couple hours). The complaints started again, but I loved my job and I wasn’t going to change it. Then I got laid off. It was a job I really loved and it really shook me to my core when it happened. I was depressed but still took care of the kids, the house suffered a bit but I was too tired to do anything. 

My new job requires day shifts for 3 months. Hence why I was working today. At around 2pm I drove home to grab my bank card as I had promised my oldest we would go shopping after school. I watched in disbelief and AMAZEMENT as I saw my husband rounding the corner with our two youngest on the way to the park, and not the closest one either. So there you have it, he was not dying, he was capable, he may have shit his brains out this morning but somehow he was able to persevere. Unfortunately the little kids saw my van and wanted to come shopping but we ended up having fun. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"AITA for not arranging childcare when my husband was sick ?

When I went back to work I took evening or overnight shifts at a hospital while he started at 1pm. I almost went insane as he would not take the kids in the morning after an overnight and not let me sleep. I would be up all night and all day with them and was losing it. He kept complaining that he really didn’t like my overnight job because our youngest would still scream for me in the middle of the night. He mentioned me finding a day job, I said fine you try to find childcare in the area and after school care, let me know when you do. Obviously he couldn’t because wait lists are miles long in our area. 

I found a remote overnight job, which paid more and was more in line with my interests. That was fine except the same problems arose of him not respecting the need for sleep after an overnight (even for a couple hours). The complaints started again, but I loved my job and I wasn’t going to change it. Then I got laid off. It was a job I really loved and it really shook me to my core when it happened. I was depressed but still took care of the kids, the house suffered a bit but I was too tired to do anything. 

My new job requires day shifts for 3 months. Hence why I was working today. At around 2pm I drove home to grab my bank card as I had promised my oldest we would go shopping after school. I watched in disbelief and AMAZEMENT as I saw my husband rounding the corner with our two youngest on the way to the park, and not the closest one either. So there you have it, he was not dying, he was capable, he may have shit his brains out this morning but somehow he was able to persevere. Unfortunately the little kids saw my van and wanted to come shopping but we ended up having fun. ",0.0,0.026173729449510574,0,1

We were looking at were to go for food on the evening so we could have a restaurant booked. We both wanted different cuisines and neither of us wanted to change our mind.

  
I suggested we just book both and that when my gf is at her restaurant, I can just get a drink and maybe a side and then when we go to my restaurant, she could do the same. She refused this because she said it's weird to sit in a restaurant and not actually order a meal. I just said I don't see any issue with it and that if she didn't want to, she could go somewhere else while I was eating and I'd just meet her afterwards.

  
She refused this and said we should just pick one place but wouldn't consider anywhere except the place she originally picked. I pointed out she was just expecting me to go with what she wants since she's already refused to go to the place I want to go. 

She said it would just be easier and that I was making things more awkward than they needed to be but I think I offered a perfectly reasonable compromise. She just repeated that it was weird and rude to go to a restaurant and not order food.

119,1cdm98v,AITA For not helping out or being involved in my sister’s graduation,"I (29f) am always relied on for planning and setting up all events for my family.I enjoy doing it, until recently.

The most recent big event that made me feel like I no longer want to help out was Christmas when I took the time to research and find the perfect gifts for everyone including my cousins(who are not my immediate family). My mom put her name on my gifts and received credit for them.

Everyone thanked my mom and never once mentioned that I thought of the gifts and purchased them, instead she took all the credit. I told her it was wrong, and said “I’ll give you half the money it’s not a big deal”. The money (thousands) is only 25% of the work I put in and she doesn’t get it.

Now my little sister is graduating from college and commissioning in a few days and my mom is calling me up to do all the work to plan a *last minute* and have her creative ideas come to life. I told her I’m not doing anything but I love her idea and she should go forward with it. 

She’s also begging me to stay at the main house mainly to help her clean it, make sure everything is planned, entertain, and ensure she doesn’t have a panic attack for the 5 day graduation event. I told her no, that I would be staying at my place and driving down only for the ceremonies and spending a short amount of time afterwards. Needless to say my mom is now upset with me. 

I’m somewhat sad and a little jealous because nobody ever does anything for me when it comes to celebrating my achievements. For my college graduation in 2022, I decorated my own apartment, made appetizers, dinner, and dessert for my family for MY graduation. They came down late rushed to eat before the graduation and left right after because my older sister planned her Star Wars themed wedding the day after my graduation “May The 4th” so they had to be there for that. My mom said they’d do something later it’s now 2024. Same thing happened for my High School Graduation I was asked if I wanted a party or to see Beyoncé I chose Beyoncé…never got either. 

However every single time my little sister has an event from High School Graduation and now College my mom has gone above and beyond to cater, plan, prep, invite etc…with my help (I do majority of the the work, she gives the money). I’m about to graduate with my Masters and there’s been crickets.

I feel bad and like I’m the asshole for sitting this one out along with a few other events like my older sister’s baby shower and I just wanted to know if I am the asshole for not helping or being there for the partying. I do want to mention that my sisters do the bare minimum for me. I asked my sisters and mom for a spa day for my birthday and a Bible…I got a Bible which I love.

i'm grieving with the loss of my friend. i've been very depressed and even struggling to take care of myself. 

my father decided one day while i was at work (i work 40 hours a week) to take all of my clothes out of my room and wash them. 

edit: i want to clarify most of them were clean! 

i have a lot. he put them all in baskets and folded them and now wants me to go out. buy myself a dresser (he removed all my drawers) and put them away. 

i've been putting it off. like i have everything else in my life. i shower like once a week. he knows i've been struggling and he's now bitching at me because there's 6 huge baskets of clothes in the living room that he refuses to let me put in my room because he ""knows i won't take care of them"". 

i told him i wasn't the one who decided to haul out my room. i'm grateful for what he did. every single day when i get home from work it's ""okay your clothes now"". every single day. 

my household is stressful enough with an alcoholic mother and parents who scream at eachother constantly. they get drunk and have friends over and blast music when i'm sleeping etc. 

i never have motivation when i'm home. i never asked him to do this for me. he keeps threatening to give them away or throw them all over my room because ""i'm disgusting and wouldn't care anyways"". i said do what u want just don't give them away. i paid for ALL of my own shit. have been since i was 15. 

like thank u for doing this?! but i never asked idk how he can complain i don't take care of them when i don't even take care of myself.

122,1cdls3m,AITA for making a joke about my friend's injury?,"Background info: Chris (27M) and I (27M) have been friends since high school. A few years ago, Chris tore his groin doing something stupid while drunk at a party. He exploited his injury in every way he could: went to work (construction) hiding his injury, then pretended the injury happened on the job so he could get worker's comp. Then when he was fully recovered after 2 months, he asked/possibly bribed his doctor to write him a note stating he still wasn't fit to go back to work in order to keep milking worker's comp; it went on for something like 10 months. I didn't agree with what he was doing but the thing that really pissed me off was when he told me he was going to have his doctor sign off on his disabled parking permit application, despite the fact that he was fully recovered. I can't emphasize enough how giddy he was when he bragged about ""working the system"" to me. Meanwhile, my younger brother actually is disabled and has trouble walking and my parents use a disabled parking permit for him. I told him he'd be an AH if he did that and that there are plenty of people like my brother who need those spots more than he does, but he shrugged it off and went through with it. He still mentions it from time to time and I always call him an AH at which point he plays victim and says he still feels pain if he walks too long. Despite the fact that since his recovery, I've literally been on hikes with him and on one trip to NYC, we pretty much walked the length of Manhattan without a single mention of discomfort from him. It's one of the few arguments we've never resolved.

Anyway, Chris got into an accident 3 weeks ago, riding his motorcycle. Luckily, he didn't suffer anything more serious than a broken leg, cracked hip and contusions but is bedridden for the next while. He was only recently discharged and resting at home, so I paid him a visit. After catching up a bit, I made the comment saying ""Well, at least now you have a legitimate reason to use your disabled parking permit"". I meant it in a lighthearted ""look on the bright side"" way but he didn't take too well to that. He rolled his eyes and said ""Oh great, this shit again"" which sparked the argument all over again. He said I was probably happy that he got hurt (I wasn't) and that I'd been wanting something like this to happen to him just so I could throw it in his face one more time (I didn't) and that I was petty for bringing it up while he was still injured. I could have just tried to explain I was joking but his accusation just pissed me off and it turned into an argument. Words were exchanged and I left.

Now my MIL is telling the family that I cut her out of the Mother's Day celebration because she was too frugal and wouldn't pander to a child. I know she is being ridiculous, but my husband is saying I could have just kept the peace for a couple of hours but I instead chose to act drastically. He said the family being together is more important than whether someone feels a restaurant is overpriced. Did I act drastically? Was I the AH?

125,1cdlg7d,AITA for commenting on some people's parenting because their kids are causing students to complain?,"So I (f19) am a full time uni student living in student halls on campus. I don't know if the way our campus is structured is the norm (especially for people in America, Im not American but ik lots of people on Reddit are) so I'll describe it.

The university I'm at has a very large campus with roads throughout it. You can drive on them but usually people just walk unless they're looking for somewhere to park their car.

There are a few houses scattered around the corners of the campus. Some have students living in them, some don't. One of the houses was sold a few months ago to a family with two parents and three kids, although this story only involves their oldest two who are ages 9 and 12.

The parents seemed like pretty friendly people and I've had small talk with them quite a few times.

Their oldest two kids have a habit of riding their bicycles erratically around the campus unsupervised. The kids are homeschooled and often do this when the campus has the most foot traffic (Monday to Friday mornings and afternoons). They often swerve inbetween groups of students and I have seen them nearly crash into people many times.

Some people from the student union did talk to the parents about this due to students complaining. I wasn't there for that talk so I don't know exactly how it went down but for about a week the kids did not cycle round the campus, only for them to start doing it again the next week.

Recently, I ran into the parents and they unprompted were complaining to me about students complaining about their children. They said that the campus is a public place and their children are not doing anything wrong, and at least they are exercising. I was pretty frustrated hearing this so my tone may have been sassier than I intended but I told them that it's not really safe for the kids to go cycling around the campus the way they are. 

The dad got quite annoyed at this and said that everyone just wants to put kids in bubble wrap and I wouldn't understand because Im not a parent. I admit I got a bit defensive and said I'm not trying to dictate how they raise their kids, just that cycling in a park is probably better for the kids than cycling on a university campus. The mother laughed and said to me that unless I'm volunteering to take their kids to the park everyday, she doesn't want to hear my opinion. There was an awkward silence and they walked off. 

They took much more offense to this than I thought they did because now whenever I say hello to them they avoid eye contact or scoff and ignore me.

He didn't seem to believe that I (gasp, a woman!) could restrain him. I told him probably not, my clients are usually smaller than him and I'm not actually that strong. He asked, for fun, if I would try and restrain him to see how effective it is. I told him no, tried to joke that I'm not on the clock and mentioned something about how I can't be bothered to write an incident report. He kept asking, a couple of friends at the table were egging me on. I changed the subject, he'd come back to it. I joked that he had a weird fetish, but he still really wanted me to try.

So I put him in a hold and he couldn't get out of it. He ended up kicking his legs out and I couldn't hold him up obviously, so he fell on his butt. I helped him up, we had a laugh and I thought all is well.

128,1cdkaro,AITA Ex Wife Wants To Stay In New Mexico I Want To Move To Colorado,"Currently in a dispute with my ex wife regarding relocating to Colorado (where we are both originally from)

EDIT: Although it wasn’t made clear below I am not expecting my ex to move in any capacity if she doesn’t want to. I’m wondering if I get primary custody and decide to move with the kids instead of getting out of the military if that makes me an asshole. 

AITA for wanting to move to Colorado with my two kids when my ex wife wants to stay in New Mexico and pursue her career aspirations. 

Context:
My ex wife and I separated almost a year ago and we have two kids. The major reason for the separation is because she decided she wanted an open relationship with someone she met and I was not interested. 

Almost two years ago she decided she wanted to become a firefighter (she was a stay at home mom at the time). I was supportive and we got her into programs to help her prep for an academy. At the time I did bring up that because I am active duty in the military (I have an office job and work Monday-Friday with a very flexible schedule) we should consider what would happen with the kids if I have to PCS (the only likely option would have been for me to take them due to the schedule of fire fighters). While she was prepping for the academy she met someone at the gym that she wanted to have an open relationship with, I declined having any interest in doing something like that and from there our marriage deteriorated and we ended up separating. Fast forward to now she failed out of the academy but is wanting to either get back into it or get her paramedics license and keeps saying she wants to get 5 years of experience in New Mexico before she moves anywhere. However, I also know she will never want to move because she has found friends here within the fire community that she calls family (she also has her parents and siblings in Colorado). I am set to PCS next summer and there is a good chance that I could end up getting Colorado. I have been in the military for 6 years now but am considering getting out after my next assignment if I get Colorado because I would like to raise my kids in one spot vs moving around forever. My ex wife thinks I should get out now and stay in New Mexico forever and raise our two kids here.

131,1cdiub9,AITA for not inviting my future MIL and SIL to my hen do?,"I (31F) am getting married to Tom (30M) in the summer after getting engaged in Jan.

A bit of backstory; Tom isn’t close to his parents and sister. They don’t tell him they’re proud of him or show him affection which is the total opposite of my family. MIL and SIL are also very different people to us which is fine, each to their own but if they weren’t related, they wouldn’t have had any sort of a relationship. At the beginning, his family made an effort with me but after a few months they stopped. We moved in together 6 months into our relationship and still lived very close to our families. We’d invite everyone round often and we saw my family very regularly but his family didn’t make the effort. His parents came round a couple of times for dinner but his sister would ignore any invitations from us (not even a polite, I’m sorry but I can’t make that date) and she never invited us round. We’ve since moved an hours flight away or a 4.5 hour train and the effort has been even more lacking. I invited them all up for Tom’s 30th and they all declined saying they only wanted to celebrate if he came to them. Eventually his parents did come up but his sister still hasn’t bothered to come visit us.

After we got engaged, his family were very excited about it which took us by surprise and they definitely seem to be making more of an effort with him which is nice to see. For my hen, I didn’t invite mums as I didn’t feel like I would be able to relax properly so I did a separate ‘bridal shower’ for my mum, stepmum, MIL and SIL to still include them. I reached out to MIL and SIL in Feb and was told they wouldn’t come to where I live. Fine. Then when I asked dates, SIL told me she was busy on X weekends and when I asked ok what weekends was she free, I was ignored. My stepmum offered to take over organising and  got the same treatment until MIL called my stepmum to say they didn’t have a single day from Feb - Aug that they could celebrate. I’ve not received a message apologising that they can’t make it. In the call MIL told my stepmum, out of context, that the daughter of their close family friend (30F) had had an agreement to marry Tom if they were still single at 27. For some reason they are enamoured with her so it felt like a personal dig. SIL also told Tom (after she knew he was proposing) that the four of them would be ‘forever’ and that me and her bf were just add ons. There’s a lot more that’s gone on but it’s just made me feel very unwelcome and not liked.

Tom’s sorting his stag and gets on with his dad, my dad and stepdad so extended the invitation to SIL’s boyfriend. She saw and messaged my mum and stepmum about whether the bridal shower was separate and it’s weird she hasn’t been invited to my hen do (I’m sure she knew my hen do was already sorted ages ago and she was trying to make a point). I’ve since tried to ask for a phone call to maybe sort things out but, again, she’s ignored me.

It was getting depressing so I asked people I know such as my dad and uncle to ask some of their friends and get me referrals.

They knew many people at big tech companies (FAANGMULA) so I was basically guaranteed to get an interview. I spent 100s of hours on practicing interview questions while waiting for my dad and uncle to get me referals. In the meantime, unknown to them, I also kept on applying to other jobs.

At one point last month I was interviewing at 2 companies simultaneously, one being the company at which my uncle got me a referral and the other being a company where I applied on my own.

I got the offer at both companies now and even though the big tech company obviously has a higher reputation than the other one (a mid sized multinational), I rejected them because I would prefer working somewhere I got hired on my own merit rather than cheating my way to it. I know this sounds hypocritical because I was the one who asked for this, but I suppose I had a change of mind.

When my uncle found out he was absolutely furious. He told me to accept the big tech offer no matter what and that my ""stupid"" argument makes no sense. He said I was privileged to get such an offer which others have to work so hard for and I told him that I don't want it anymore. Things got so heated that he might even go no contact with me now.

133,1cdi1vj,AITA for telling my dad I don't want to go on a vacation with him?,"Some backstory for context. 

My (23/F) parents (52/F and 58/M) divorced back when I was 5 months old. At the time of marrying him my mom didn't know that he had 4 more kids from 3 different women that he never saw or provided for. They quickly got a divorce after my mom found out he was cheating on her and so I entered his long list of children that he never cared for (At the time of this post there are 6 of us). 

When I was four, my mom started a relationship with the man I consider my father (47/M). Their relationship lasted about three years but they remained good friends and he continued to be a steady father figure in my life. He's now married and my mom was his wife's maid of honor and the godmother to both of their children, so it's safe to say we're all a big happy family. 

Two years ago, my biological dad reached out to me. I had only seen him a handful of times prior to that and he never seemed interested to form any type of relationship. I'm not angry at him for leaving, I had a great childhood and two amazing parents by my side that I wouldn't change for the world, so I wasn't opposed to the idea of meeting him.

In that first meeting he confessed that he was diagnosed with a heart condition and that helped him put things into perspective and realize that his kids are what matters in this world. I had to stop myself from laughing at this point because all his ""kids"" are in their 20's, and out of the 6 of us, only I agreed to meet him. Anyway, he has been making an effort and calls me every once in a while to catch up which has been fine. 

Onto the problem. My bio dad hates my dad. He never met him, but hates the idea of him and tries to compete with him in the most childish of ways, like getting me a new sofa I didn't ask for after he found out that my dad had built me a table for my new apartment (it's his hobby). Usually it's funny and a bit annoying, but it escalated two days ago when he booked a holiday for the two of us on the exact dates that I'm supposed to travel with my dad to France. That's where my dad is from and every year he takes us all to his parents' house for a couple of weeks. It's a tradition going back to when I was a child and obviously I wasn't going to give that up to go on an awkward holiday with a semi-stranger.  


I immediately refused but he began sobbing, saying that I put ""that pervert"" over my blood and how I should be embarrassed for not recognizing how much he's trying to be a part of my life. I was speechless and left without saying anything. At first I felt angry at him for putting me in this situation but my boyfriend says I'm the asshole here because he's my dad and I should try to make an effort too. I don't know though, I'm still so angry and upset. AITA here?

That being said, she rarely fully cleans and even when she needs to do her chores, she does it so poorly that we have to either complete it for her or my parents will have to fight with her to do it properly. 
However when her friends come over to hang out, she will start cleaning and be on everyone’s case to keep the place tidy. My family will just shoot “looks” at each other and not say anything.

So today I was in the kitchen baking ( I bake a lot ) and my sister sends me a text asking me to keep the place tidy because her friend is coming over. I know she asked me because when I bake, I leave things standing out and my bowls will be all over the place. I just read her message and replied “hmm” and carried on baking. I got annoyed because when SHE bakes or cooks, she will leave the place FILTHY but all of a sudden it’s going to be an issue if I have some things laying out. 

I left the kitchen as is because I still baking and my sister comes home with her friend. As she’s unlocking the gate, she pulls a face and glares at me and walks inside with her friend.

135,1cdhkjb,AITA for not giving my childhood friend his gift back?,"Hi, y'all. I had this happen a few months ago but it keeps weighing on my mind and I feel like I could use some new opinions.

**The Backstory:**  
I (24F) used to be best friends with this guy (24M), lets call him Jerry, since Elementary School. We were inseparable friends, and our families used to tease us that we were like siblings separated at birth.

When I was a kid, my parents didn't let us have any video games at home. It took until middle school for me to get my first console. My cousin had just given me her Gameboy Color with Pokemon Blue, Yellow, and Crystal against my parents' wishes, and like any 'rebel' kid, I felt like a million bucks. 

I went about showing Jerry all my new games and the Pokemon I caught. We spent a while geeking out about the games. Jerry did the same with Pokemon Platinum on his DS as I hadn't seen that game at all yet. He even let me play for a few minutes and I ran into a Shiny Rotom. We both lost our little 10-year-old minds. Good times!  
  
A few months later, about a week before my birthday, Jerry said that he had a gift for me. I was super confused, it wasn't my birthday yet. But he said that's okay, and that he wanted me to have this. In one hand is his DS and in the other is all his Pokemon games. I was over the moon- but as a kid, even I knew this wasn't something you just give away. I refused it and offered it back. Jerry just promised it was okay, and he wanted me to have it. Eventually, our parents talked and explained it was a gift I could keep. From there, the two of us went on as best friends for years.

However, time passed and by my Sophmore year of High School, we stopped hanging out altogether. It was sad, and through the remaining school years, we would run into each other sometimes. There was no bad blood, but we just weren't friends in the same way.

**Here's where I don't know if I'm the asshole.**  
So, after we hadn't spoken for almost 6 years, since High School graduation, Jerry called me up. I was surprised of course, but delighted to hear my old friend on the line. I started to ask how he was and Jerry cut me off. He asked if I still had the old Pokemon games he gave me. I said I did and before I could even say how much I appreciated them to this day- ready to be nostalgic about our childhood- Jerry asks for them all back. 

I was in shock and just apologized, trying to explain I had saves and memories in them going back 11 years- not to mention at this point his save data was gone. Jerry just went silent, after a few moments he said okay, hanging up on me. 

It was surprising and confusing. I mean *11+ years* after he gave them to me as a birthday gift and years of silence later, and Jerry wanted them back?

When I was talking to one of my friends afterward, she said I was kinda TA since they were his games and memories too. I felt really bad and it just sits there weighing on my mind now. 

I still think I'm in the right to keep them, as it's been 11+ years.

136,1cdgxwm,AITA for not being able to drive a car?,"My husband (42m) and I (39f) grew up in adjacent suburbs of one of the largest cities in our country, but when we met we were both living in apartments in the city centre. When we got married, six years ago, we had a pretty big discussion over where we would live. I was happy to stay in the city, even if we had kids, but my husband said that if we decided to start a family he would want us to move out to the suburbs. I conceded that a bigger living space and easy access to grandparents for childcare would probably outweigh my desire to live in the city centre, but I was concerned that transport links would be poor. He asked if I would be willing to learn to drive.  


When I turned driving age as a teenager, I had been super excited to get my licence, but cars and I simply didn’t gel. I had poor spatial awareness, I panicked under pressure, and I was petrified of other cars. Even so, I agreed to try again. I took lessons, but then fell pregnant, and then started learning again but fell pregnant for the second time. So all in all, I’ve been learning for six years and still don’t feel ready to take my test.  


Over the years, my husband has been bringing up driving with more and more frequency. Whenever I ask him to do more around the house, he brings up the fact that he does 100% of the driving (and therefore 100% of the things that need a car, such as grocery shopping, school drop-off and pick-up, driving to and from family trips/visits). I have no frame of reference, but I suspect that he overstates the difficulty of driving – I don’t think it’s as hard as doing the kids’ laundry or cleaning the house (two of the chores I do most of the time). I also think that the two regular things he does the majority of – cooking and driving – are things that he enjoys doing, whereas nobody likes vacuuming or laundry.   


He says that the fact that I can’t drive is placing an unfair burden on him and on the kids. He brings up the fact that we had to cancel our son’s after-school tennis lessons when he was asked to go in to the office one extra day a week, because the tennis club was virtually isolated from public transport (nearest bus stop is 30 minutes’ walk away, but it’s just a 5 minute drive). He says that I am relying on the fact that he and my mom & dad are usually around to give us lifts when we need them, and that he is worried about what we’ll do if he becomes incapacitated in some way.

He confessed to me a while ago but I don't see him that way and I already have someone who I like ""Sean"" (which he knew about) so I rejected him but we decided to stay friends and everything was normal for a while.

But then he started to change, he started being... alot. He started being all shitty and pouty whenever I mentioned Sean, which is fair so I stopped bringing him up. But if he asked me what I was doing and I just mention I'm hanging out with Sean, his mood instantly shifts and he starts giving me one word replies and being cold but if I try to be ambiguous about it, he gets mad at me for not telling him everything like i used to.

Oh and I went dress shopping and I'm indecisive so I send pictures to my girl best friend ""Amy"" to help me decide even though I hate taking pictures but she always helps me out so I'm used to sending it to her. Well me, Amy and Austin were out for lunch and she said something about how she's sad I didn't buy that red dress I sent a pic of (she said it looked good on me but I felt fat in it so i bought a different dress she said looks good on me) and Austin was like aww you never sent me pics of that and i told him i hated how i looked in it so i dont want to. He didn't like that and said why does Amy get pics of it but I can't and the lunch just became really awkward after that.

And another thing is that I've stopped venting to him about my problems and he complains about how I don't tell him anything anymore but this is because whenever I do he starts shifting the topic to himself and I end up having to hear him vent while I'm literally crying about the thing I was venting about. Tthis happened  5 times now lol, dont get me wrong i dont mind him venting at all but man why annoy me to vent to him and then make me be the one who has to listen to him vent while I'm LITERALLY crying.

He went off on me about how he's my best friend and he's not wrong for wanting a picture and he screamed at me about how I'm selfish for expecting him to listen to my problems but I won't listen to his and I told him that's not the case and he's just an ass for venting when I am and making it about himself.

139,1cdgqoa,AITA for refusing to let my stepmother be part of talking to my therapist or psychiatrist?,"I (17M) have a diagnosed mental illness. Got my diagnosis formally at 12 and that was a shitty year for me. My dad uprooted us 2 months after my formal diagnosis to live with his then-girlfriend (now wife) and I left behind everyone else I knew and loved and during the move some sentimental stuff got destroyed. The stuff was my moms and dad had put it in the wrong pile after I tagged it so it wasn't handled with the care it should have been. I was pretty much destroyed at that point. I already hated that we were moving and then to lose some of the stuff mom loved the most. I was admittedly a mess and the next couple of years. I took forever to find a new therapist. My original psychiatrist here wasn't someone I clicked with either and it took like a year for a new one and almost 3 for me to find a therapist I could talk to.

I admit I'm not that into Emily. I do hold resentment toward her and dad for the move. She also rubs me the wrong way but I also admit I'm not exactly super open to liking her. She's made comments about it being good that we moved so I can learn how to miss people (which is really fucking insensitive but then she seems to remember that I'll forever miss someone). She has spoken like I agreed to the move (why did you move if you weren't going to try and enjoy it) and when I'd tell her I didn't agree she'd say dad made the decision and I should trust him enough to want this and give it my all. She has complained that I didn't let her family members fill the void of my missing family from here and she has seemed kinda sour that I'm closest to my mom's family above everyone. We also clash over me saying she's married to my dad/my dad's wife to people instead of saying my stepmom. I said stepmother once and she told me it sounded so detached and I told her that's how I feel.

It drives my dad crazy and we discussed me moving in with my grandparents back home but dad changed his mind about it twice. He told me I'm his kid and he's not letting me go and he wants to repair our relationship. He asked me to forgive him for making decisions that I felt were for the worst for me. He said he's trying to do right by us both. This is why he typically respects when I don't want to include him in my therapy sessions.

But my dad is anxious that I'm almost 18 and he wanted to have a meeting with my psychiatrist and therapist about me, but he wanted Emily included and I said no, and I expressed this to both my therapist and my psychiatrist so they won't talk with her in the room. Emily was so offended. My dad was hurt that I still wanted to shut her out and that I didn't trust his decision in partner. I told him she is not my parent and she does not get access to that stuff about me. I told him I can't stop him telling her technically. But I will never give my consent for her to talk to them herself.

They told me I need to let her because she's one of my guardians and it's important for them to be on the same page. Dad begged. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"AITA for refusing to let my stepmother be part of talking to my therapist or psychiatrist? I (17M) have a diagnosed mental illness. Got my diagnosis formally at 12 and that was a shitty year for me. My dad uprooted us 2 months after my formal diagnosis to live with his then-girlfriend (now wife) and I left behind everyone else I knew and loved and during the move some sentimental stuff got destroyed. The stuff was my moms and dad had put it in the wrong pile after I tagged it so it wasn't handled with the care it should have been. I was pretty much destroyed at that point. I already hated that we were moving and then to lose some of the stuff mom loved the most. I was admittedly a mess and the next couple of years. I took forever to find a new therapist. My original psychiatrist here wasn't someone I clicked with either and it took like a year for a new one and almost 3 for me to find a therapist I could talk to.

I admit I'm not that into Emily. I do hold resentment toward her and dad for the move. She also rubs me the wrong way but I also admit I'm not exactly super open to liking her.

140,1cdgp5w,AITA for making my Friend cry.,"Maki and I have been friends for almost a year. Lately in this final stretch of school, we've been given a ton of school work with deadlines so close from now, and these are our major outputs so obviously everyone's stressed about it including me. A few hours ago, we were given even more work to do and its so much that it's just overwhelming. Its wasn't explained clearly on what we were supposed to do.So My friends (Dan and Reiyn) including Maki decided to ask after class.

While we were waiting, we talked about our research paper, were Maki and I are Groupmates for it. Then out of nowhere Maki started to just blatantly say mean things to me, I'm sure I didn't say anything to her to start this. She's Always been judging me in the smallest details every time i talk to her. When I ask a question she would say something judgy but not offensive. One time she just finished writing a part of our research paper on paper and we needed it put in a folder so naturally since i was holding the folder, she gave it to me and not even five seconds in me putting it in, she says she'll do it since I'm so slow and yanked it out of my hands. A another example would be when i was cutting tape with my teeth because we didnt have scissors, i was okay at it but she just said i didnt know what i was doing and insisted she would cut, we were almost done. Even my classmates know how much she does this to me and only me. There are more examples but i need to continue the story

Tears almost left my eyes because of the shit she's talking but i didnt let it happen. I just sat their taking it in and respond to few on what said, most of it I dont really remember. I was kinda just laughing to my self on how ridiculous this situation is. At some point I said "" you're the reason why I dont want to work on our research paper"" I honestly didn't mean it. It just slipped out in the moment. Maki, now alot more angry started to cry, i can hear how much emotion she's pouring all out in her words.

I stopped talking at this point, and she continued her Argument on how she's always the one to tell me what to do because im lazy to start anything the teacher gives us and how I'm so selfish for not caring and understanding how she feels. This is completely contradictory on what she says in messages to me, that its such a good thing that I'm in a group with her and she said it herself that it would be a struggle if I wasnt here.

At this point, I have nothing to say , I just nod while doing a thumbs up. Dan and Reiyn try to stop her on continuing but she continues. At some point she does stop and just cries where she's sitting at.

Im surprised that this has just happened, I'm not even on my phone. I'm just staring at a wall while thinking on what to do. We're going home and I'm with Dan then Maki passes us. I didn't know if I should even attempt to say sorry, since I know she would just attempt to continue arguing with me. I think Saying sorry to her at that moment would just make things worse.

Some important context to add is that, FF always visits my wife and my wife houses, feeds and gives her whatever she wants for any time she wants.

  
Now, my wife has always given her (FF) a fixed amount after each cleaning which is way higher than what she charges everyone else, about 50% higher. I'll use £300 as an example of what she gives FF.  
Recently, we decided to cut down on some excess spending and my wife decided to ask FF exactly how much we should pay for the service. She said £150 including her transportation fare to get to the place she cleaned.  
My wife is upset that FF added a ""transportation fare"", even when she has been overpaying her for months, then I heard that the final amount was 50% less, I asked her to calm down because we are going to be saving and it doesn't matter if she added it or not.

  
She says the money is not the issue but the fact that the family friend included a transportation fare in her bill but all the time she helps the family friend with housing, other stuff, gifts, and other things she would never ask her for money for it. Basically she expected her to give her a fixed bill (even if transportation was included in it), but she just didn't expect the FF to outline transportation as part of the bill to her.

142,1cdge0a,AITA - asked my husband not to play sport,"My husband and I got married a year ago. We're both in our mid 30s and have recently started trying for children. Last week, we found out I was pregnant and would have been due in December, but a few days later we learned that it was a chemical pregnancy. We're going to keep trying for kids though.



Before I took the pregnancy test last week, my husband expressed an interest in trying out for a competitive sports team where he would be representing the state for 10 days, out of state, in October. He's good at this sport and even represented the country in it last year, but it is essentially a hobby and there is no money earned from his participation - in fact it would cost a few thousand dollars for him to be involved (but the money isn't the issue). We talked about it and decided to see the results of the pregnancy test - when it was positive, he said that made the decision for him and that he wouldn't try out.



Five days ago we got the confirmation that the pregnancy wasn't viable and today he again asked me what I thought about him trying out for this team in light of this change in our circumstances. I told him I thought he'd made his decision and that it's not something that I'm that particularly comfortable with him doing at this point in our lives, especially when it's likely I'll be pregnant in October. We thought last year would be his last year playing and with the training and time away, I feel that it will take his focus away from us and our family. He still plays this sport socially once a week anyway, on top of a busy professional job.



I don't want him to feel resentful towards me and our future child for preventing him from playing, and I think he knows deep down that it's not the right thing for him to play. I was still a bit annoyed that he asked me again though, I don't really want to be the one to tell him ""no"" and think he needs to come to that decision himself.

I (18F) have been friends with, let’s name him Spence (19M), since the 2nd grade. We had just started to hang out again, as we hadn’t talked much since HS graduation.

 I invited him to see a production at my university, in which my boyfriend of 4 months is doing stunts in. When we arrived, there were concessions, and as Spence hadn’t eaten much that day, he tried to buy some snacks, when he discovered they only took Apple Cash and physical dollars, he spent the entire first 30 minutes of the production trying to connect his card to Apple Wallet. I didn’t say anything, but I was quite annoyed, because I felt like it was a bit disrespectful to be on your phone for that amount of time. While I’m already annoyed, Spence decides then to try to talk to me throughout the rest of the production, I gesture to him to please stop talking several times, and he responds by saying “WHAT?” even louder almost every time. 

I’m not neurotypical, so it is very easy for me to get overstimulated, so I try my hardest not to lose my temper or break down. With all of this happening, he then starts trying to lean his head onto my shoulder, I gently move him, and after a few more minutes of him trying to talk to me, I excuse myself to the bathroom. He then insists on going with me, and trying to hold my hand on my way there. I slip my hand out of his and jog a little ahead of him. When I get out, same shit. We sit back down to watch the rest, he starts grabbing my shoulders and such when something thrilling seems to happen in the performance. I ask him to please stop touching me. I end up just dealing with it the rest of the 2 1/2 hours. 

When the performance is finished, we wait around to meet my boyfriend, who Spence had yet to meet. It’d be about 5 minutes before he could come up front and meet us, and while we walk to the place we agree to meet at, Spence clings to my arm. I end up shoving it down, my face turns red, and my eyes begin to water, I sternly and angrily demand him to “stop touching me”. He gives me a “my bad”, and after a couple of seconds I start apologizing, and I explain to him that I get overstimulated easily, and I’m not really in the mood for physical touch. 

When we finally see my boyfriend, I give him a huge hug, we share a small kiss, and we hold hands while he walks me to my car. 

After our little meetup, Spence and I head back to my car so I can drive him back to his house. We talk like seemingly normal. When I get home, he texts me wondering how I can be so “overstimulated from physical touch”, yet hug and kiss my boyfriend. He goes off on me about how I don’t make any sense, and tells me that I’m a fake friend.

146,1cddniy,AITA For Disinviting Friend to BBQ Over My Garden,"Throwaway since some people who know me may be connected.

I'm planning a BBQ for an upcoming holiday, and recently sent the invites. A friend who has been to my house asked if they could bring their SO. I said that was fine. It's important to know that I am an avid gardener and have a vegetable garden along with a pollinator garden in my yard.

Then they said that their SO is very allergic to bee stings (like carries an epipen allergic). I said that was understandable, and we can just eat indoors. I can accommodate the party size inside, and if the weather is nice, I can just keep the windows and doors open (all have screens) to bring the outdoors in.

The response was ""well, I don't want to disrupt your plans too much, and it would be nice to be out on your patio. {My SO} has a repellant spray they can bring to keep the bees away from your patio while we do the BBQ."" I asked them to send me the specs of the spray, and if it isn't harmful, that might be a solution.

It's a pyrethrin spray. Yes, it does have some repellent qualities, but mostly, it just kills most insects, and is extremely harmful to bees. I said that I would not be spraying that in my yard and sent information that it is harmful to bees and other helpful insects. But they're still welcome to come and we can eat indoors with no risk of bee stings (the risk is low anyway since I mostly get bumbles and they're very docile...I have never been stung in my yard/garden, even though I come in close contact with the bees regularly!).

They ended up declining the invite, and apparently told some mutuals that I was being difficult about making the yard safe for the SO I've never met to attend. I've tried to explain to them that I'm not willing to kill the pollinators that make my yard WORK, and that I offered to move the meal indoors, but I've gotten mixed responses. Half the group says I'm fine and I shouldn't bug bomb my yard for one person, and the other half says my neighbors are probably spraying those pesticides (and they might be right), so what harm is one application in my yard going to do. AITA?

Edit based on comment (THANK YOU!). The first move on friend's part was to decline, then rally friends to try to get me to change my mind, and when I wouldn't back down, I rescinded their invitation. Some friends are pressuring me to accept the spray so our mutual friend can come with SO.

During my parent’s marriage, my father was never a good husband. He constantly blamed my mother for all of his problems, and he never helped her with literally anything around the house or with raising myself or my brother. 

In addition, my mother was the breadwinner and paid for everything. My father had a good job, but it was still nothing compared to what my mom earned. 

When I was 7, I fell down at school and doctor’s thought I had a concussion. It turns out I didn’t, but apparently my father didn’t even care enough to pay attention to what the doctor’s were saying. My mother says that day is when she decided to divorce him. 

Over the years since, my interactions with my father have been limited to getting lunch with him, about once every 3 months or so. It’s mostly tolerable for me, but even so he spends the time mostly talking about himself and never really asking me anything. He also constantly is trying to teach me life lessons or give me advice. 

Many times he tries to pass judgement on me for not speaking his first language (Marathi). However, he thinks it was my mother’s job to teach me this language, not his. My mother first language is Hindi, and doesn’t speak Marathi. He passes judgement for many other things like that.

All of this being said, recently I found out that he went to the ER due to a kidney stone. My father has had various health problems for many years. However, several times in the past, he has gone to the ER, not told me until he has already been there for a while, and then passed judgement because I didn’t rush over to give him moral support.

We are on a trip, meeting up with my 77yr old sister and brother-in-law for the first time in 18 months. We are miles apart physically and also politically. As a result, I’ve been nervous about getting together. So far, so good. Our first morning, we were there alone and ate at the hotel coffee shop. Our meal was cold, and my husband complained that the food was super salty,partly burned and the manager apologized and comped our meal. When our relatives arrived later that day, my husband mentioned the disappointment in the restaurant. The next morning, I suggested we drive to a local place we know and they agreed. This morning my husband woke up thinking about how they’d probably want to go to the hotel place. I was mildly exasperated, suggesting other things he could get there and then came up with another off site local spot. I made a point of being the one to suggest the local place.  Later in the morning, my sister said maybe tomorrow we could go to the hotel restaurant as she likes their pancakes.

150,1cddhxo,AITA Not Wanting to Babysit,"I (25) had a severe injury last year that required physical therapy, my last session being in December when I was finally able to walk around again. Before that injury I, along with my mother(56) babysat my sister's(31) nine year old son while she worked at her job because she kicked out her abusive boyfriend (his father). 

It was hard for me then even when the work was split between me and my mother. Her kid has a lot of energy and he doesn't always listen and he can be very loud. With my autism I get overstimulated and emotionally drained after dealing with stressful situations or just social situations in general. So you can imagine watching a nine year old for hours takes a LOT out of me. 

After I recovered from physical therapy my mom got injured and had to start physical therapy almost immediately after I stopped. She had taken the reigns on babysitting while I was hurt so it was my turn to do the same in January.  
But now that the work isn't split I'm coming home completely stressed out. He's ten now so I know he's going through changes in his life but it feels like he respects everyone but me.

When he's throwing a tantrum over something he'll blame me and yell at me even if I haven't done anything and when I firmly tell him to stop he cries and yells and acts like I treat him awful and tells his mom I'm mean to him when I've been doing nothing but my best to take care of him.

I've talked to my sister about a recent incident where he got really mad and said something very disrespectful and she punished him. I neglected to tell her that I nearly had a panic attack on one of the days I babysat him. 

I just know the next time I babysit him which is coming up soon, (I babysit him 3-4 times a week) he's going to get upset at me and give me a hard time for telling on him.

I get paid by my sister for this but my mental health is at an all time low. 

I'm overeating to cope, it feels like I could cry at the smallest things, I'm always anxious when I babysit him, I can't enjoy my hobbies, I'm exhausted all the time and don't have the energy to help with chores at my own house so all the housework has fallen on my younger brother.

But I can't quit until his summer vacation next month (he'll spend a majority of time with his grandparents and my brother can take over on sitting) because I'm literally her only option. It all falls on me which just makes the stress worse. I feel so trapped. When summer vacation is over I want to tell her I quit.

151,1cddebd,AITA for asking my partner to talk to my friend before moving into my apartment,"Adam is my friend and Eve is my partner.

Adam tends to do ""managerial"" talk, if that's a thing, where he asks leading questions and such and tends to act all wise and all-knowing. He makes you feel like you're wrong and he's helping you learn something, but all of this in a very obnoxious managerial way he does. It doesn't feel like you're talking to a friend sometimes. From what I've observed, he seems to do it for fun, at times. He just likes getting on people's nerves. I've gotten used to this and it honestly doesn't bother me much. We're still great friends and I just tend to ignore him when he's being annoying like that.

Eve is quite shy and anxious around most people. She also despises confrontations because she feels really powerless and dumb. She prefers to talk freely only to those very close to her. Eve clearly doesn't like talking to Adam, because of how he converses. She doesn't think of him as a bad person. She just is quite afraid of engaging in conversation with him because she's worries he's going to ask her difficult questions and make her feel stupid. For this reason, as much as possible, she avoids being around him alone.

I live in an apartment with Adam. We have our own rooms. Eve is over quite often and we spend most of our inside my room. Recently, Eve and I talked about her moving in with me. I told her that we could talk to Adam and could figure out how to split the rent and other household expenses. Eve is against this. She feels like she already has trouble talking about money and would absolutely lose it and end up crying if he said something that made her feel shitty. She is also afraid that if we have to negotiate on how we have to share any of the costs of living, she would definitely not be able to say a word.

I acknowledge and understand how she feels about this. However, I also feel like this conversation should involve all of us since we'd be living together. I explained to Eve how I wouldn't mind having the conversation myself but then everytime we'd need to have an input from her, I'd have to go back and forth between her and Adam and this conversation would take much longer than necessary. I told her that I'd talk to Adam beforehand and let him know that she's feeling a bit anxious about it and ask him to be nice. Knowing Adam, I know he would understand and oblige. However she was still uncomfortable and felt I'm forcing her into an uncomfortable situation she didn't want to be in. She said she no longer wants to move in.

I told her that I would have the conversation myself with Adam and figure it out and she wouldn't have to be involved in it at all.

Then the next few classes, I also stayed a couple mins past the hour just to finish up the question we were working on. But this last time, the mom had sent me multiple docs of questions, and there was no way we were finishing that in an hour. So I just told the kid that we’d finish next week, and she said bye to me as well. So I left the meeting. 

Then the mom texted me and said she was disappointed that I left without telling her. And also that I should come back and finish the questions. I said there were too many to finish in a few mins, so if she really wanted them to be done this week, she could schedule another class even later today.

My sister and her sort of not-ex had plans to watch TV tonight. Note that when she told me about this, she said nothing about sitting where I was sitting.

Anyway, he took the other armrest as usual. She asked about sitting where I was before they sat down to eat, and I said no. She got mad and started to wind up because my refusal to move was unexpected (she said this in her ""apology"" where she was still attempting to convince me to move). I rejected her and ended that conversation because I found her request to vacate MY seat just because SHE is uncomfortable laughable.

My mom has helped out my siblings in very generous ways. They're homeowners because of it. I'm not. Last year, my mom reached out to me and we talked. It has been challenging but I'm trying to be more sensitive. Out of the blue, my brother reached out to me and said she needs help with various things.

She hasn't done shit for me and I owe her nothing. How egregious is my mom? She actually demanded that I pay her rent for a few more months after I had moved out 10 years ago.

I said I can do things to help out like take her to appointments. Regarding tasks that involve money, I expect to be reimbursed from one or both of you. You both aren't poor. I'm not spending my money so you don't have to spend yours and/or you can ask mom for money knowing that she has it. I'm not going to help out just because you benefit from it.

155,1cdcobf,AITA For not letting my brother's boyfriend sleep here?,"My brother and I were left in charge of our parents' house since they went on a trip, although I am the youngest sister, my parents usually trust me more than they trust my brother since he sometimes takes a lot of advantage when they lend him something or leave him in charge. So it's kind of an unwritten rule that I'm in charge and I make the decisions.

Since this week my brother's boyfriend started coming to work at home as a way to force himself to go out and socialize more, we both get along very well and sometimes the three of us spend time together, But sometimes his presence is exhausting for me, I'm not sure why I just know that seeing him so often this week has made me realize that, but I haven't told my brother since he is happy to spend time together, so when I finish working I say that I'm tired and go straight to my room to be alone.

Today when he went home, my brother asked me if his boyfriend could stay the night on Saturday and be here on Sunday, normally I let him do and undo as he pleases, but I don't know if it was because I was half asleep or because I was tired, but it made me panic, so between everything I decided to tell him the truth. I told him that there was no problem, that I understood, but that he should understand that it was very possible that I would go away and spend the whole weekend in my room, I told him that I know that I am a complicated person, but for me to see him every day is a little too much, I reiterated that he can come without problems but please don't be offended if I just prefer to be apart. He understood and ask me if it was possible that also the dog of his boyfriend spend the night... honestly in that part I was firm as a rock, I directly told him no, our family dog ​​is already very old and has vision problems, so he has become very nervous in the presence of other dogs,, and her boyfriend's dog is less than a year old, it's at least 3 times our dog and it's still a little rough when it comes to playing (obviously because it is so young), I told him that directly bringing the dog to sleep was too much for our dog.

My brother told me he didn't see anything wrong with bringing the other dog, but I explained to him that the last time another dog came into the house he wasn't there and our dog was crying and shaking....then my brother started to tear up... I asked him to forgive me but on the issue of the dog I was not going to be flexible, I felt bad seeing him like that, I don't know if it was because of his boyfriend or both, should I have let him do what he wanted?

I 19(f) have been working at my current job for 2 years, my manager 29(f), lets call her sam has had issues with me for about as long as I've been there. 

For some context she used to be a full-time manager and was recently promited to be our general manager, in the 2 years I've been there I've applied for supervisor once and assistant manager twice, both of which I did  not even get an interview for due to her having some biases due to a coworker who has not worked there in the time I had applied for those, this is part of the reason I wish to report her. 

I am well respected amongst my coworkers and trained and almost all of our departments. When we had our previous general manager I was given 3-4 shifts a week in my prefered department and was given more opportunity for leadership when on shifts. Since Sam has become general manager I get one to two shifts a week in a different department that I am not as strong in.
 
I also notice alot of other small things that others notice as well. Sam's very friendly and has lots of conversations with other staff we have but she's rarely will even say hi to me when I clock in or when I say hi to her. She will have me do some tasks involving food prep or cleaning up in front by the counters and not in the usual way instead of in the back where food prep areas are and in the proper manner that we usually do. 

When I try to take other coworkers shifts for them she will deny the request due to ""cutting hours"" but will allow other people to take shifts for the same times and days. Sam's just been always generally very cold towards me and out of her way to make my job more difficult and unpleasant. I am at the point where after 2 years I am fed up with her petty grudge that she seemed to have formed at some point. 

I have also talked to other management that no longer works there and they have confirmed that she has bad mouthed me in the office but never about anything specifically and has never said one good thing about me.

So, to put a little bit of context, she is having a rough time at her job and academic life. Basically, she is having a lot of pressure in her working environment, and recently she was also forced to go back to the office on a daily basis. Also, she is currently a student just in the need to finish her thesis, but this has been a pending item for the last 3 years. 

Well, in my case, I recently graduated from my masters degree (thinking about starting my phd) and I am working in a great place, with a nice salary and a pretty good environment. We are like totally opposites right now in this area, but im trying to be supportive with her as I know she is not having the best of her time.

The thing is that, even though our wedding is one year away, she is kind of stressed thinking that all her life should be resolved before we even get married (nice job and college title). And every time I mention our wedding, she gets in a really defensive manner to me. 

It exploded last night, when I proposed to go on a date to celebrate that we are exactly one year from getting married (like a -1 anniversary). She told me that she is not sure about getting married and she no longer thinks we are going to make it (I guess she said this just from anger, but it still hurts).

In the past, I have offered help with her thesis, to sit down and work with her, or to fill her LinkedIn profile to start looking for a new job. She normally accepts this, but when I bring it up to start working on these topics, she again starts actin in a very defensive manner. And I know she will not do it by herself because she procrastinates a lot when having free time.

It is very annoying to me, because I only want to help her, but she pushes me away. We should be happy about planning a life together but  apparently, she just want to be stressed about not having anything solved (which should not be an issue, she has all her life to fulfill her dreams, and even better if it is with me), but also not working on the things she is worried about.
