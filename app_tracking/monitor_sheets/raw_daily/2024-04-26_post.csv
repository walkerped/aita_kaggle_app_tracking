0,1cditmf,UPDATE - WIBTAH if i ( m25 ) come clean and tell my girlfriend ( f21 ) that her parents hate me? ,"Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7ylm1HwkRx

After I posted and read the comments I decided to tell Sally when she came over the day after I made my original post, when she arrived I asked her if I could talk to her about something important and she agreed, i then told her about what happened when her parents pulled me aside to talk, some of the comments told me to lay it on her gently so I did that and made sure to tell her that I didn’t hate her parents and knew they were probably just trying to protect her. She looked sad and guilty the whole time I told her the story and all the other stuff they told me, she looked really confused and disappointed and she said she never thought they would be like that because they’ve always been nice to her and the friends she’s brought home. I told her that it might be different cause I’m her boyfriend, not her friend. We talked for a few more hours about it and she kept apologizing for her parent’s behavior and the things they said to which I kept telling her that it was alright and that it wasn’t her fault. 

She also told me that her parents might be acting that way because of her older half sister that started dating this guy a few years back and he ended up being a really bad influence on her sister, she didn’t go into too much detail but I know from what she’s told me that it was really bad and messy. Now I can kind of see where her parents were coming from that night, still doesn’t fully excuse their behavior though. 

Well after Sally went home she told me she had a long talk with her parents, surprisingly her parents didn’t deny it but they thought they were justified in what they did which annoyed Sally, she told her parents to apologize to me in person and after a bit of back and fourth they agreed and started realizing that what they did was unfair to me, so next week I’ll be seeing them and hopefully it goes better than last time. 

I also showed Sally the original post when she came back to my place the next day and she was reading all the comments and realized that her parents have really coddled her all her life which is another issue she’ll have to talk to them about soon. But anyways that’s the update, me and Sally are doing great and hopefully I can form a healthy relationship with her parents in the future.

1,1cdc2yn,AITA for yelling at my best friend after he told me he wanted my girlfriend?,"I(22M) have been friends with my best friend ""Luke""(22M) for 15 years, my girlfriend ""Luna""(21F) and I have been together for 2 years now. A couple days ago, Luke and I were hanging out at my place, we were goofing around, playing games, and suddenly Luke got a serious look on his face, he looked at me and told me that he had had a thing for Luna for a while now. I was shocked, I didn't know what to say at first, I just asked him what he meant. He explained that he had always thought Luna was beautiful, and that he had a huge crush on her before me and Luna started exclusively dating, but once I told him I liked her, he backed off. He told me the feelings were always in the back of his head, but that once I mentioned I wanted to propose to Luna soon, his feelings for her grew like a wildfire, he told me he didn't want to hurt me, but he couldn't keep lying to us and himself about it.

He said he might've even loved her, and it hurt him to see me and her together. After my initial shock wore off, the only thing I could ask him was if he was being serious, he said yes. Anger filled my body, and I began yelling at him to stay away from both me and Luna, how I couldn't believe he was saying these things, and a lot of hurtful insults about his checkered past with women. I yelled at him to leave my apartment, and he did. Later, I received numerous messages from him saying how hurt he was.

I'm normally a very docile person, but I was so angry hearing him talk about how he loved Luna. The messages stopped after a few hours, and we haven't spoken in a few days. I haven't told Luna what happened, but I'm still so angry at him. I know I should tell her, but I can't bring myself to start the conversation. I've been thinking about it now, and I really need an unbiased opinion of this situation.

So, AITA for yelling at my best friend after he told me he wanted my girlfriend?

  
Edit: A lot of you are saying YTA for my yelling, I would like to say that I don't condone violence, nor do I think it was mature of me to yell. In the moment, I was angry and wasn't thinking. I'm going to have a talk with Luna later today about this situation.

2,1cdbyzi,AITA for Not Wanting to Share My Inheritance with My Siblings?,"  
Hey everyone, I'm seeking some honest feedback on a situation that's been weighing heavily on my mind lately. Here's the deal:  
  
Recently, I inherited a significant sum of money from my grandparents. It wasn't just about the money; it also included some valuable family heirlooms and properties. Now, here's where the dilemma kicks in: my siblings are pressuring me to split the inheritance evenly with them.  
  
Here's why I'm hesitant:  
  
1. **\*\*Different life paths\*\***: While I've been diligent in my career and have made sacrifices to secure my financial stability, my siblings have taken a more leisurely approach to life. They've made choices that haven't necessarily led to financial security, and while I love them dearly, I can't help but feel like my grandparents' intention was to reward responsibility and hard work.  
  
2. **\*\*Family dynamics\*\***: There's always been some tension within our family, and money has often been a point of contention. I fear that dividing the inheritance equally would only exacerbate these tensions and potentially lead to irreparable damage to our relationships.  
  
3. **\*\*It's my inheritance\*\***: This might sound selfish, but I can't shake the feeling that this inheritance is rightfully mine. My grandparents chose to leave it to me, perhaps recognizing the effort I've put into building my life. Shouldn't I have the autonomy to decide what to do with it?  
  
However, I do understand where my siblings are coming from. They see this as a shared family legacy and believe that dividing it equally would be fair. But is it really fair when our life circumstances and efforts have been vastly different?  
  
So,  I turn to you: Am I the jerk for wanting to keep the inheritance to myself? Should I consider splitting it with my siblings despite my reservations? Or am I justified in wanting to preserve what my grandparents left specifically for me? Your insights are much appreciated.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"AITA for Not Wanting to Share My Inheritance with My Siblings?

3,1cdbtam,AITA for not traveling 200 miles to make up with a friend,"this all takes place about 4 months ago when me(19m) and my closest friend(19m) got into an argument. we were both drunk and I had just gotten out of a break up so I was in a bad mental place, and he was spending the night at his crush's place in uni. while staying at his crushes he messages me complaining that the alcohol was making him angry over the fact that he didn't have a chance of getting with her. this was mostly due to the fact that he never made a move and practically refused to believe he would have to put any effort into getting her but that instead she would just come to him one day.  
  
I had made it clear that I was not in the right head space to give advice out and had come off all social medias expect for WhatsApp so my friend could msg me because I knew he struggled to be alone and I was his only friend at the time. yet he would still come to me asking for advice and would get mad that my out look was depressing.  
  
during this conversation as I was trying to calm him down, he brought up the fact that I've became bad at helping him and that he had replace me with a girl who had lead him on for 2 years before hand, who I also had to get out of his life on his request.  
  
eventually he went from saying I was depressing to just attacking me about my insecurities. he would say stuff like my dad is right I'm just a parasite that wouldn't amount to anything other then being a drug addict (I have a history with weed which he had seen me battle before and at the time was relapsing mostly due to the break up).  
  
at this point I got fed up and started to argue back saying thing I knew would get under his skin, which I admit I shouldn't have done but u have to understand that I was drunk and fed up of the attack I was receiving.  
  
after some time he blocks me and I don't hear from him for a couple weeks. until one of our mutual friends calls me and gives the phone to my friend. he says his still pissed but is willing to talk it through and that he expects me to show up at his uni 200 miles away to apologise.  
  
at this point I'm fed up that he was willing to risk throwing away a 7 year long friendship over a drunken argument that we both should have just apologised in the morning and hugged it out whenever we both saw each other. but instead he decided to block me and all our friends and refuse to talk to any of us.  
  
about a month after this phone call the mutual friend messages me again asking when I will go down to apologise to him. I tell him I'm to busy to see him as I now have a job and would meet him whenever he's back in our home town where we both tend to be in at the same time. I don't get a response and get blocked by the mutual friend.

5,1cdb8yo,AITA for not wanting to hang out with my boyfriend,"I 25F have been with my 25M boyfriend for about 6 years now. When we first stated dating, I lived with my parents and was a part time student and worked part time and he was a full time student + part time worker. We used to hang out a lot because we both had a lot of free time. As of last year, I had some problems at home and had to move out of my parents home and drop out of school. With living on my own, I’ve had to work more to feen for myself. I work about 50-55 hours a week with my regular full time job + side jobs right after which includes translating/waitressing/delivery services, whichever I get called in to do. I feel super tired by the end of the day.  My boyfriend ended up graduating college and is now pursuing higher education, while im still trying to make my own living work which I have but I also want to pursue higher education but fear getting into debt and not being able to finish. A lot of times after work, I am exhausted and just want to relax at home. However my boyfriend barely works, he works maybe half of what I work. He gets frustrated with me for being so tired so I get angry and sad. I don’t have the luxury of my parents being able to pay for my schooling and caring for me at home since I now do everything on my own. So there are days I do not want to see him, I very much love my home and my space and not having anyone tell me what to do or asking me for things. When I hang out at his house I absolutely hate it because his family is there. They are all loud and messy and the home is always hot or smells because of their pets in the house. I enjoy being in my own home that I pay for. When I told him I prefer to be at my house he told me it wasn’t fair that we always hang out at my house and not at his. I do not want him living with me either because he does not work a full time job and is going to school again which means he does not intend on finding a job. I don’t want to hang out with him because I feel like we are not seeing each other at the time level. He tells me how things used to be but I cannot control what “things used to be” when I lived with my parents and could easily just hang with him whenever. I don’t know.

A week later I was told that I had to do the roller coaster because we could not work on it in 7th hour(my study hall period and a class that he did not need to be in he also did not have any other homework) So I took it home and but my dog completely destroyed it so I had to remake it a day before it was due. I made it but when I got to school the tape came off so I had to fix it at school when I was trying to fix it Trey kept saying I should change it and change where the drop shoot was so I was doing that and then one of my classmates that I was being controlling and saying some other stuff so I left the room for a little bit to cool off. Then I came back and Trey was fixing the support which was not broken and did not need to be messed with it was fine and I asked him if he wanted to put the drop shoot on and he said no. So the next hour I completely did the roller coaster. Then Trey made the poster and I lost it on accident so I apologize to him and said that I can make a new one because I lost it and it's my fault so I made a new one and then he wrote on it something that wasn't legible I could not read it and other classmates couldn't read it and this is supposed be a majority vote on your poster so I remade it and he called me an a-hole and said that I wouldn't let him do anything I said that he could make the posters as long as it was legible but he got mad.

I made it but when I got to school the tape came off so I had to fix it at school when I was trying to fix it Trey kept saying I should change it and change where the drop shoot was so I was doing that and then one of my classmates that I was being controlling and saying some other stuff so I left the room for a little bit to cool off. Then I came back and Trey was fixing the support which was not broken and did not need to be messed with it was fine and I asked him if he wanted to put the drop shoot on and he said no. So the next hour I completely did the roller coaster. Then Trey made the poster and I lost it on accident so I apologize to him and said that I can make a new one because I lost it and it's my fault so I made a new one and then he wrote on it something that wasn't legible I could not read it and other classmates couldn't read it and this is supposed be a majority vote on your poster so I remade it and he called me an a-hole and said that I wouldn't let him do anything I said that he could make the posters as long as it was legible but he got mad. Am I the a-hole? Also he had not asked if he could help with the coaster at all he just let me do it and take over and I already did most of the paper and he wrote nothing.,0.0,0.1243075,0,1

10,1cdans1,AITA for giving my dog a bigger bite than my girlfriend’s dog? ,"Gf and I have been together for 8 months. We don’t live together but we usually do dinner at either my place or hers a couple of times a week. We are dog lovers and both of our dogs get along great. Whenever we visit each other, the other person always brings their dog.

So anyway, dinner tonight was at gf’s place and we decided to order some pho for takeout. As we were assembling our food, I gave one bite of beef brisket to my dog (Henry) and one bite of beef brisket to her dog (Squirt). Henry is a black lab and Squirt is a corgi. Since Henry is much larger, I gave him a larger bite of beef.

My girlfriend saw this and got upset that I didn’t give Squirt the same size of bite. I explained to her that since Henry is the larger dog, I feel that it makes sense for him to have a larger treat. She was super pissed and said that Squirt doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t get a big bite, and that it wasn’t fair.

I calmly tried to explain my reasoning again but she just didn’t agree. She called me an asshole and said I was not treating the dogs equally. I offered to give Squirt and Henry both another equal sized bite but it didn’t really help the situation. She said it was the principle of it and the fact that I didn’t think giving them different sized bites was wrong, made her question my character.

To me this feels like a really small thing to get upset about, but it’s been a couple hours since Henry and I have gone home. I texted her goodnight and she didn’t respond.

11,1cdamq9,AITA For hoping my girlfriend would help me out around the house more while I am at work?,"This is going to be a long one. My girlfriend (19f) and I (20m) had a stupid argument. I wanted to come on here about and some opinions, because it’s getting really hard for me to understand her side sometimes. 
I just got a new job, a management job, where I’m working 12 hour days 5 days a week including a 6th day on Saturdays (halfday). It’s stressful, and long. So I usually come home very tired.

Today I came home with the kitchen a mess, trash everywhere, sticky counters, a sink full of dishes and zero dinner. I’m not really into the old fashioned ways of “woman has to take care of the household” especially if they work (she does not work by the way, she hates working). I think it should be split evenly or atleast fairly, it’s not like I never clean. I do it on the weekends when I have off. I get home, she is on her phone and does not greet me like normal. It kind of made me feel the wrong way, but that’s besides the point. I said “so there’s nothing cooked? Did you eat today babe?” In which she doesn’t respond and ignores me. I can tell it made her mad, so I just dropped it and went in the kitchen to clean up her mess, and start doing the dishes.

It’s 9pm, I have to get up at 7am, and I am a full time college student. I have finals I need to complete before this weekend and I really needed to start. Later she comes in the kitchen and it all seems fine. I bring up how I wish she would’ve helped me a little more. She says that it’s my responsibility. I say I worked a long day and have a lot of work to do, and that she was home all day. She apparently was “at the pool for only 2 hours” and “busy getting her nails done”. I said I just think out of respect and love for your partner, you’d understand my situation and try and help out a bit more. Just for the week, and on the weekends I can help clean more. She repeats herself on how she needs a day off (from being home all day) and that if I didn’t have her I would have to do it all myself. 
She then proceeds to say that since I did not pay for her nails, and that I do not buy her jewelry or other things she has no “responsibility” to clean or help me out. Because she isn’t my “maid”. Even though she knows I struggled a lot since I met her moving between jobs and I haven’t been able to buy her as many things. I still try my best to surprise her now and then, or atleast go out once a week on a dinner date. But she said that without something in return, it makes no sense for her to be “obligated” to help. I told her it was not an obligation, I just would have appreciated help.

We ended up just yelling at each other. It got heated and I ended up calling her a no-no word. I ended up having coffee thrown all over me, the walls and floor. Which I cleaned because she left. Now I am sitting here wondering if I am the asshole for approaching it like that. Of course I should have not called her a name. Definitely an asshole for that. But anyways.

12,1cdam3b,AITA for expecting my friend to apologize after she forgot my birthday?,"I (f) celebrated my 27th birthday last week. This story is about one particular friend, let's call her Ashley (f27). As some background, Ashley and I have known each other for about 6 months after we met at a mutual friend's Halloween party. We were especially close the first three months we knew each other, texting every day and meeting up 1-2x/week, but ever since I moved out of the country in early February, our friendship has settled a bit, messaging over discord about once a week and playing video games together every now and then. At some point, I mentioned to her when my birthday is, but we didn't talk about it extensively and I never really reminded her about it.

Come this past week, she forgot my birthday. This is understandable, as I didn't remind her, but I still felt hurt. She was not the only one of my friends who didn't remember, and I was feeling both very alone and like I am just a friend of convenience to many of my friends back home. I texted her to inform her that my birthday was that day, and this ensued a brief conversation where she said happy birthday and that she wished I had told her.

She followed up a few days later, noting that the conversation was tense. I stated that I wished she would apologize for forgetting my birthday. To me, I have always understood there to be an unspoken societal standard that friends will always remember each other's birthdays, even without prompt or reminders, in the same way that I would expect a partner to remember an anniversary, even without prompts or reminders. For this reason, I have many of my friends birthdays memorized and always go out of my way to remember. I am learning that this is not the standard for everyone.

Thus ensued a very long and intense conversation, with her saying that she should not apologize for an expectation she didn't know about, and me saying that the kind thing to do when you hurt someone is to apologize, even if the hurt was unintentional. I was very clear that the fact she is refusing to apologize is even more hurtful to me than the fact that she forgot my birthday, because by refusing to apologize, she is sending me the message ""I don't care if I hurt you as long as it wasn't intentional."" In my mind, if I hurt someone unintentionally or not, the kind response is to always apologize. Because apologizing tells the other person that you care about their feelings. 

The conversation ended with her saying she would never apologize, and me saying that she has broken my trust and I cannot trust her with my feelings anymore. I just no longer feel comfortable opening up to someone who would not feel any level of remorse after learning they hurt me.

On reflection, I am worried I'm overreacting. That I should not have felt hurt, and that I should just let go of the fact that she will never apologize for hurting me. That I should not expect an apology. Should I just let it go? AITA?


Update: I get it, I'm the asshole. I am being unreasonable, and I will apologize to my friend tomorrow. Also, news flash, just because I acted like an asshole one time does not give strangers on the internet the right to call me names and bully me. I am very open to hearing good faith criticisms that address my actions, not intentionally mean comments looking to tear me down. Thanks for listening. 👍🏻

Extra update: I apologized, and she was very forgiving. She even offered to write me a poem as a birthday present. Some of you commenters could really take a lesson from her!

14,1cdaako,AITA for Asking Someone Who Took My Phone To Bring It Back,"My phone goes missing at a grocery store, not sure how it ended up happening initially because I was listening to an audio book. I bike to the store and carry my groceries home in my backpack. I also stash my phone in my backpack so it doesn't fall out of my pocket while I'm riding. Again, not sure what happened but apparently some very old man who has lost his phone found mine ( either I had dropped it, it had fallen out of the cart, left it somewhere because I am the stupid ADHD brain ) and I guess assumed it was his? Not sure.

I spend a good ten minutes looking for it but I can still hear my audio book so I'm convinced it's nearby. Then the connect goes dead and I resign myself to the fact that I'm going to have to buy a new phone because someone might have stolen it. Then an idea!

I ask one of the employees working the parking lot to call my number, maybe I'll hear it ( and I wish I had this idea earlier ). No dice for five minutes but the guy ( bless him ) kept calling and eventually someone picks up.

We spend the next five minutes going back and forth, I keep asking him to bring my phone back to the location where I am - and it was taken from - because I'm on a bicycle. Dude has a car and apparently his Dad is getting old and took my phone by mistake? Not sure. Either way, I'm doing my level best to be polite because I need this guy to do what I want and bring my phone back to the customer service desk while he lectures me about congeniality and being rude over the phone.

At first he refuses to come back to the grocery store and tries to get me agree to go to a second location ( specifically asking me where I'm going ) to meet me there instead.

He then offers to take it to a police station and then asks which one is most convenient for me and I have to clench my teeth and take a breath before continuing.

Another few minutes of back and forth before he relents and says it'll be half an hour.

15,1cda7kc,AITAH for yelling at my auntie?,"So I have a younger sister, she is 3 years younger than me and all my life she has been treated slightly differently than me. Whenever she would do something wrong and get in trouble for it she would put the blame on me (even though I've proven that I wasn't guilty). With my auntie however, she takes things way too far, and I mean way too far. Like during her birthday party one of my younger cousins asked her if she wanted to play with her (keep in mind our younger cousin is 6) when my sister got up to go play with her my auntie told our younger cousin that she didn't want too play with her because my auntie and my sister were watching Taylor Swift. I'm getting off track but this one particular day, we were at a party and my aunt picked my sister and I up and through out the drive she wanted to know what my sister wanted to listen to and of course it was Taylor Swift. She didn't even asked me how my day was she just wanted to spend time with my sister. (Even though they see each other every weekend.) When we arrived at the party we were giving speeches about one of our family members. My aunt got up and said her speech about my family member, I needed to go to the bathroom so I got up and walked towards the bathroom. My cousin was there by the restroom and I asked her if I could go in and she said ""Yes of course I got you cousin"". So I went in and did what I had too do. When I came back out my auntie was there upset at me, she said, "" Can you act mature for once?! Your sister can act more professional and proper unlike you!!""

So I have a younger sister, she is 3 years younger than me and all my life she has been treated slightly differently than me. Whenever she would do something wrong and get in trouble for it she would put the blame on me (even though I've proven that I wasn't guilty). With my auntie however, she takes things way too far, and I mean way too far. Like during her birthday party one of my younger cousins asked her if she wanted to play with her (keep in mind our younger cousin is 6) when my sister got up to go play with her my auntie told our younger cousin that she didn't want too play with her because my auntie and my sister were watching Taylor Swift. I'm getting off track but this one particular day, we were at a party and my aunt picked my sister and I up and through out the drive she wanted to know what my sister wanted to listen to and of course it was Taylor Swift. She didn't even asked me how my day was she just wanted to spend time with my sister. (Even though they see each other every weekend.) When we arrived at the party we were giving speeches about one of our family members. My aunt got up and said her speech about my family member, I needed to go to the bathroom so I got up and walked towards the bathroom. My cousin was there by the restroom and I asked her if I could go in and she said ""Yes of course I got you cousin"". So I went in and did what I had too do. When I came back out my auntie was there upset at me, she said, "" Can you act mature for once?! Your sister can act more professional and proper unlike you!!"" At this point I was mad so I yelled back ""What!?! I needed too go to the bathroom!!!"" she rolled her eyes and said ""No! You know what, I'm telling your father about this. You're acting mean!""

The wedding is a destination wedding clear across the country. The flight will be around $600, the hotel for 3 nights around $400 or so, the nearest airport is an hour away from the resort meaning I’ll have to pay for transportation or a rental car, I have been asked to share costs for a bachelorette party, pay for my own hair and make up, buy my own dress for $130 plus my alterations. Also unsaid expectations to buy bridal shower and wedding gifts. Obviously there would be other expenses while traveling too such as food. The wedding is about 6 weeks away. I’ve been putting off booking anything, trying to convince myself to do it. The resort is located in the middle of nowhere so I can’t try and spin this into a vacation. Lots of people have declined the invitations or backed out of the wedding party already so this is another reason I’ve tried hard not to back out. I feel so guilty. This friend barely speaks to me, we’ve only spent 3 days together in the past year.

17,1cda3et,WIBTA if I tell my partner his parents told me he needs to lose weight?,"WIBTA
So I (34f) and my husband (35m) have been married for 4.5 years. In that time he has put on some weight. I’ll admit I have gained 5-7 lbs since our wedding day, but his is definitely over 50 lbs if I HAD to guess.

It’s always a rollercoaster, he starts a diet for theee weeks and falls off. 

Now even though, I wish he was more consistent I have NEVER said anything negative about his weight gain to him. He works really hard at his job and I can see he is stressed and trying to figure it out. I also can see how upset it makes him when his clothes don’t fit and we have to go shopping for every event (weddings, work events,) for new clothes.

 About 6 months ago my husbands dad, my FIL, came to me privately and told me that he was concerned about his weight and that I needed to talk to him.

This caught me completely off guard, and I didn’t even know what to say. Ultimately I was upset though, because it’s not my job to control my husband NOR am I ABLE to; and HE should know that.

I decided not to tell my husband because I knew it would for sure break his heart, and his dad should have spoken to him directly.

Fast forward to yesterday, I run into his step mom my MIL, and she starts telling me how they are BOTH concerned with his weight.. once again making me feel like it’s somehow my fault?

This time I immediately replied with, “He needs to bring this to him, it’s not my place to relay this message to him”. And then she went onto insinuate that I need to encourage him, and of course I already do. 

I’ve come up with point systems, reward systems, tried to get him to come to CrossFit with me, do weight watchers, noom with me etc. But ultimately I understand that a person will only lose weight when they decide to, it has to be something he makes the decision to commit to.

Keep in mind, this is not the 1950s and I don’t have the luxury of staying home to cook his every meal. We both work full time jobs, and really only eat together on the weekends because i travel a lot. 

I am now in an awkward position of do I tell my husband about these two conversations his parents had with me? Or do I wait and hope they finally approach him instead of me? 

I feel like I’m hiding something by not sharing what has transpired, but I also want to protect him and don’t want to hurt him.

WIBTA if I tell him about these conversations? Or do I let it go and pretend like nothing happened? 

TLDR: my husbands parents told me I have to tell him to lose weight, do I tell him they told me this? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-26,"WIBTA if I tell my partner his parents told me he needs to lose weight? WIBTA

20,1cd9v31,AITA for telling my roommate he must clean up his dog's poop from the yard this weekend?,"So, I want to preface this with some information. My roommate is amazing, outside of cleaning. He actually helped pay a few months in advance to fix an issue caused by the electric company, which was fairly urgent. While he can be stubborn at times, he's always open to talk, and is overall a very understanding person.

I'm preparing to rent out another room in my house, and plan to post it at the start of May (which I told him months ago and stated again throughout April). The house had turned into a bit of a mess, since the entry room was fairly packed with his stuff (and in fairness, a suitcase of mine), and the kitchen was awful (he's the only one who cooks and the oven was filthy, dishes piled in the sink, counters messy and unclean). However, during the last week, he did clean up most of his things from the entry room, got the dishes done, and I finished the other cleaning.

However, after all this, I'm a bit concerned about his daily maintenance. I tried to get him to start doing dishes daily earlier this month, but he never really started. Right now, there's a winter's worth of dog poop in the yard, which he mentioned he'd clean up once it got warmer. He bought a shovel, but never went out. Today, I talked with him to stress how important upkeeping things daily, such as the dishes and stovetop, will be, including cleaning the yard.

He mentioned he'd try to clean the yard sometime soon, but he was busy this weekend with work. I really wanted to stress that it needs to be done daily, and he made the fair point that there is a lot compared to when he does go through and get it to a point where he can do it easier daily. I pointed out that it was very fair, and that I'd ask he at least go out for 20-30min daily until everything is cleaned up, stressing the daily aspect. He got pretty upset (nothing aggressive/no yelling), and said he would get it done by Sunday night. I insisted that he would go out tomorrow, and after a few more times of him saying soon, he reluctantly agreed to do it tomorrow.

However, I realized I was sort of being a hardass. Yes, he should be doing it every day, but I'm not planning to take pictures of the house until the 1st of May, which does give him more time. I came back and apologized for being too much of a hardass, and that it's all good if he gets it done by the end of this weekend, but it was fairly brief. Especially considering how much he helped me out by paying rent in advance (seriously saved me), I feel like an asshole for not giving him more slack in our conversation.

I have a classmate called TJ who we three consider as rude and annoying, Kira said that TJ made mocked for failing an exam last semester and Kevin said that TJ even knocked the door of his flat to ask for help with an assignment for a class I was not taking. 

I am also taking a class with TJ that Kira and Kevin are not taking. In this class we do a lot of simulation work and our lecturer usually guides us during the class and we are meant to write reports after that. The simulation processes are usually really long so you had better not loose any step or ask shortly after that.

At the beginning of the semester TJ asked me for help with an assignment. At the beginning I was going to say yes, so I agreed to meet him after a class with Kira and Kevin that TJ is not Kevin. I asked them about TJ was like and they warned me that he would take a lot of my time. TJ was even desperately phoning me before I arrived. He basically me to go through the whole simulation process again and explain it to him, so I said I didn't remember the whole process and just saved my results for my assignment, which was true and then left.

He has phoned me several times. Last weekend he phoned  me asking for help with an different assignment. I said that I was not at home, which was true and he even asked me to send an exercise  before a specific time so I blocked him. Two days ago I run into him on campus and insistantlly asked me to share the simulation code. I said no because and I said that it would be pretty obvious who copied to whom if we had the same code in an exercise we were supposed to do by ourselves, but he said that he wanted to copy one that we did in class so he insisted. I was suspicious that he would share it with someone else. I'm not sure because sometimes I don't understand his accent. 

I did e-mail him the code, but I didn't not unblock him and I slightly modified some lines so he would get a different result. 

I told my parents about this situation on videochat. My dad thinks I was wrong and I could just have explained the exercise to him, but my mom thinks I'm busy enough. I said that it's too hard to explain something I'm struggling to understand too. 

AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-04-26,"AITA for sharing a wrong code with a colleague? I'm an engineer and am studying a Master's degree. I have a group of 3 friends including a girl, Kira; a lad, Kevin and myself, a lad. 

I have a classmate called TJ who we three consider as rude and annoying, Kira said that TJ made mocked for failing an exam last semester and Kevin said that TJ even knocked the door of his flat to ask for help with an assignment for a class I was not taking. 

I am also taking a class with TJ that Kira and Kevin are not taking. In this class we do a lot of simulation work and our lecturer usually guides us during the class and we are meant to write reports after that. The simulation processes are usually really long so you had better not loose any step or ask shortly after that.

At the beginning of the semester TJ asked me for help with an assignment. At the beginning I was going to say yes, so I agreed to meet him after a class with Kira and Kevin that TJ is not Kevin. I asked them about TJ was like and they warned me that he would take a lot of my time. TJ was even desperately phoning me before I arrived. He basically me to go through the whole simulation process again and explain it to him, so I said I didn't remember the whole process and just saved my results for my assignment, which was true and then left.

He has phoned me several times. Last weekend he phoned  me asking for help with an different assignment. I said that I was not at home, which was true and he even asked me to send an exercise  before a specific time so I blocked him.

24,1cd91ch,AITA for speaking to my neighbor through my door instead of opening it?,"Background: I've lived in my apartment building for 10 years. I work from home and have a hypersomnia neurological disorder that's getting worse. Aside from being sleepy at all times,  I'm sensitive to heat and generally have to have the air conditioner on and a fan blowing on me, even in colder months. I live alone, so I'm rarely in more than shorts and sometimes less.

This is not a ""social"" building. There are 6 other apartments.

* Two are occupied by my elderly Italian immigrant landlord and his wife (they hate each other so he lives in the basement).
* Next door's a young couple who are clearly using the apartment as a pied-à-terre; they're rarely here and mail and packages pile up weekly.
* Below is a 30ish single woman.
* The remaining flats are occupied by an octogenarian lesbian widow and a middle-aged Greek immigrant and his wife.

Aside from my downstairs and next-door neighbors, everyone here was here long before I arrived with my then-roommate 10 years ago. As I said, we've barely interacted. I'm chat with the lesbian widow (she hangs out on the stoop so we have a long conversation when I pass by). Maybe she likes me because I'm queer too, but probably she is just lonely since her wife died 4 years ago.

But that's it. Between the fact that my landlords are always angry and pretend not to speak English and the fact I have nothing in common with anyone else here, it's ""hi, how are you"" if we cross paths..

The \*one\* neighborly thing we all do began when someone started bringing packages from the ""lobby"" and leaving them outside our apartments. Personally, it's not something I want or like--I'm  capable of going down and getting my deliveries; and I'm on the top floor, so I feel guilty that an older person is schlepping up 2 or 3 flights for me. Nevertheless, since I can't stop them from doing it, I do it too. If I pass a package, I bring it up and drop it off.

In 10 years I've had 5 knocks on my door. Once, the landlord knocked for an emergency (burst pipe). Twice, the landlord knocked because he had a bug up his ass about something. Twice, political canvassers somehow got in. That's it. There's a lobby buzzer, so I never have a reason to expect a door knock.

But, last night, the neighborly act of bringing up a package became an intrusion. I was passed out on my sofa, naked, with the TV on (remember, I have a neurological disorder that makes me hypersomniac and hot). Then KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. I wake up, confused. ""Hello? Who is it?"" KNOCK KNOCK. ""One minute?"" I get up and go to the door. ""Who is this?"" ""It's your neighbor!"" (Um, which one?) ""What's up, is something wrong?"" ""I have your package for you."" ""Uh, thanks...but I'm in the middle of something, can you just leave it there?"" ""OK. I'm your neighbor."" ""Uh, thanks? I'm sorry?"" She goes away and I can hear her grumbling.

I was naked, disoriented, it was 9 PM, and I didn't ask for hand delivery, but...am I the asshole? I don't want to be a misanthrope; what could I have done better?

25,1cd8ynz,UPDATE: AITA for not speaking Japanese after living here for 6 years,"My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/MeESRljwno

So, we got divorced. 
I think about it more and more and I feel like this 6 years has been hell for me… I am tired of keep on finding any reason to think that he is good for me.

I found a full time job in a Japanese company and started working there from last January. Everybody in my new company said I speak Japanese well. And so far I am doing great! I rent my own apartment and surviving by my own just fine in Tokyo. Albeit my ex husband saying that I would never be able to survive in Japan without him.

I have a crush on other guy, but I take it slowly. 

Thank you for all of your comment to me. i am glad I posted here.

Edit: I use only Japanese in the company I work now and earn almost same amount with my ex husband despite just work here for 4 months. My crush now speak only japanese and we communicate just fine.

I am confident now!


Another long edit because I am surprised that I got so many responses:

Thank you so much for the comments and supports. Just to clarify, of course the reason of my divorce is not only because of the language thing…

I kept saying my ex was a good person (and I still think that he is a good person) but he is not treating me right.

There were a lot of things he had done to me that had harmed me physically and mentally.

Before I was with him, I was also doing modeling for side job. I took good care of myself, but after I married him, he said that my look didnt matter and he disliked me dressing up or putting on make up because thought as a married woman I should not attract other men. I did what he wanted and I kept telling myself “oh this man loves me the way I am no matter how I look…” but then I found out he was following sexy girls on instagram and twitter.

He never chatted them so I let it slide but I kept thinking about it. Especially since he never said anything positive about my look (basically he never said anything positive about my effort except for my cooking) I started to feel unconfident. I got depressed and had to take anti depressant then I gained 20 kgs in 6 years.

When I said he never said anything positive about my look/effort it didnt mean that he always said bad things about me, just he seems to be indifferent about it.

Now, after we got divorced, I dont have to take my anti depressant anymore. And I lost 15 kgs already… I started to talk to some guys until I met my crush right now.

I was surprised because my crush now always said that I look good and nice, he noticed when I changed my hair style or nail, saying I smell nice, and compliment me when I do good thing at work (my crush works in the same company with me).

The other people also said that I look super good now, and I look so much happier.

I want to show you my pictures so you can see the difference between when I was single, married, and became single again, but I know there is a chance some of you might recognize me…. And then would recognize who is my ex husband and it would cause problem for him.

Anyway, how I learned Japanese (and other languages) is by listening to some song, movies, or other people, then when I cant understand some word/phrase, I would find it in dictionary based on how I hear it. Then I have to guess how it is written so I can find the word in dictionary/translator. I prefer dictionary to translator though because when I open dictionary I will see many other words other than the one I am looking for and I may remember those words I accidentally find too…

After I find the word and understand what it means, i will try to make a sentence with that word and use it in real conversation.

Now, I can already read Japanese’s comic book and watch the movie in cinema without much difficulty. :)

Once again thank you for your support!

Please wish me luck for my career and my life ahead. (Also for my crush, hope it ends well)

I also wish all the best for all of you, may you learned something from my experience and may it be useful for you or at least it could give you good feeling when you read this update.

Cheers!

26,1cd8ltl,AITA for refusing to help my wife?,"This morning I refused to help my wife get up out of bed.

For context, my wife is very overweight. I'm not here to complain about this fact—she's been large since I first met her, and I've always found her attractive.  But she has gained a significant amount of weight over the last 4 years.

Shortly before our daughter was born in 2019, my wife weighed in at an appointment and was 428 lbs. This was a shock to me; I knew she had gained a lot of weight since we met, but she is private about it so I never heard a number. Once she and our daughter were home, we tried to take healthy steps to improve ourselves together. She recovered well from her pregnancy, and was set to resume her job in March of 2020. COVID changed that plan. After 1 week back at her job, she was furloughed for 2 weeks. At the end of that period they fired her. Luckily, my job went remote and I make enough to support our family.

For the past four years, she has become increasingly reclusive. When I have offered to take time off to give her a break from the kids, she has declined. We started taking stay-cations in summer 2020, and even once the pandemic was over she has said she prefers staying at home to traveling. Her weight has noticeably increased during this time; I don't have a number but I wouldn't be surprised if she's now over 500. Her mobility has suffered as well—she needs breaks when we take walks, we've had to put wall handles in our bathroom, and the last few months she needs help to get out of bed in the morning.

When I've tried to address this with her, she admits it's a problem, but she downplays its severity. Our marriage is great, she is a great mother to our two children, there's nothing (at least nothing she's shared) under the surface: she says she just likes to eat and struggles to control her portions and snacking.

This most recent incident started because yesterday evening, as we were taking our kids to the park, she insisted that I drive instead of her. Her insistence weirded me out and I asked her about it later when we were going to bed. She informed me that she's begun struggling to fit behind the wheel of our family car. This really freaked me out, and we had a long conversation before going to sleep. She again denied anything was wrong, and when I suggested she visit the doctor to get a better picture of her health she was pretty annoyed. I was upset and told her to think about how she would take care of the kids if something happened to me. It's not safe for her to rely on me for so much. She kept ignoring me and went to sleep. I stayed up and stewed a little bit.

This morning, to prove a point, I refused to help her out of bed. I just went into the bathroom. She was able to get up eventually, but it took a few attempts and she was crying and begging for help. I went in to work in my home office, and since I got off work she has been unwilling to talk to me.

27,1cd8loa,AITA for telling my teacher the inappropriate things my lifelong friends have been saying about her? ,"I (16M) have this amazing teacher at my school. She is kind of young, and she is around 23-24 years old, we could call her TC for her initials. I also have these friends that I have had for most of my life, most I have had around for about 4-10 years. 
We are all in her 5th period class in high school. She is an amazing teacher. She teaches us stuff everyday and still lets us talk to each other. She also lets us come every day to her room during a free period, and she is always funny. All of us like her, like I said before, she is funny, kind, and caring. But recently, the friend group that I was in for that class, has been annoying for the last couple months. 
First of all, they are all kind of just dicks now. They talk shit to each other all the time and it is just a toxic feeling. I still love all of them, just they are annoying sometimes. And I forgot to say this before but TC is my favorite teacher ever, and she is amazing in kind of everything. I can’t explain it really. But anyway, my friends have started to say weird stuff about her too. I think the main reason they say it is because of how nice she is and that she is young. But it gets out of hand a lot of the time. They just talk about doing stuff to her that I don’t have the heart to type out, but you know what I mean. They also just say generic weird stuff to her. 

My one friend made a “hoe list” and made a ton of people (including TC) on there and people that he would.. you know. It is really fucked up typing it. But this has been going on for a while, and it sucks cause she never knew. I decided I had to tell her.
      I went to her a lot and tried to convince her to let me tell her everything, and she let me. I told her a lot, but not everything. Before I tell this, I have to give a backstory. So apparently, she had a condition or something (I don’t really know what she said?) but it made her overweight or something. And my friend told me one day, “did you know TC was a fatass in Highschool?”, and I talked to him and said that it was weird to bring that up. Another thing I have to explain, TC is currently engaged with another teacher at the school, and they have been dating since 7th grade. My friend then followed up with “what did Mr. (TC’s fiancée) see in TC” and I thought that was kind of fucked up. So I told her about that.

",Asshole,2024-04-26,"AITA for telling my teacher the inappropriate things my lifelong friends have been saying about her?  I (16M) have this amazing teacher at my school. She is kind of young, and she is around 23-24 years old, we could call her TC for her initials. I also have these friends that I have had for most of my life, most I have had around for about 4-10 years. 
We are all in her 5th period class in high school. She is an amazing teacher. She teaches us stuff everyday and still lets us talk to each other. She also lets us come every day to her room during a free period, and she is always funny. All of us like her, like I said before, she is funny, kind, and caring. But recently, the friend group that I was in for that class, has been annoying for the last couple months. 
First of all, they are all kind of just dicks now. They talk shit to each other all the time and it is just a toxic feeling. I still love all of them, just they are annoying sometimes. And I forgot to say this before but TC is my favorite teacher ever, and she is amazing in kind of everything. I can’t explain it really. But anyway, my friends have started to say weird stuff about her too. I think the main reason they say it is because of how nice she is and that she is young. But it gets out of hand a lot of the time. They just talk about doing stuff to her that I don’t have the heart to type out, but you know what I mean. They also just say generic weird stuff to her. 

My one friend made a “hoe list” and made a ton of people (including TC) on there and people that he would.. you know. It is really fucked up typing it. But this has been going on for a while, and it sucks cause she never knew. I decided I had to tell her.
      I went to her a lot and tried to convince her to let me tell her everything, and she let me. I told her a lot, but not everything. Before I tell this, I have to give a backstory. So apparently, she had a condition or something (I don’t really know what she said?) but it made her overweight or something. And my friend told me one day, “did you know TC was a fatass in Highschool?”, and I talked to him and said that it was weird to bring that up. Another thing I have to explain, TC is currently engaged with another teacher at the school, and they have been dating since 7th grade. My friend then followed up with “what did Mr. (TC’s fiancée) see in TC” and I thought that was kind of fucked up. So I told her about that. And she thanked me and stuff like that, and I told her to not tell anyone in the friend group the stuff I was going to tell her. I felt so bad for her. I could tell she was very sad.

Throwaway, on mobile so sorry for typos, fake names

I (28f) have been friends with Tina (28f) since college. We were freshman year roommates and have been very close ever since. Even though we’re really good friends, Tina and I are really different people. I’m the life of the party and Tina is more of the quiet and mousy type. we were totally inseparable in college. When we were in school, I took Tina to every party and introduced her to everyone I knew, including Henry (29m, Tina’s now-husband). To be honest, I think Henry used to have a crush on me, but he was never really my type. He’s kinda dorky tbh. Henry and Tina got together in junior year after being friends for a while and they’re absolutely perfect for each other–I’ve never been anything but happy for them both.

Anyway, Tina and I are so close that we can go a long time without talking, but we get each other’s life update on social media. That’s how I found out that Tina and Henry are finally getting married. I was thrilled, but thought it was weird that they didn’t send me an invitation. I figured it was a mistake and my invite just got lost in the mail, so I found out through a mutual friend where and when the wedding was and was thankfully able to make it.

At the wedding, Tina gave me a weird look when she saw me in the audience and Henry was just staring at me the whole time. I shrugged it off at first but something just didn’t feel right. I couldn’t get rid of the nagging feeling that something was wrong and it just kept getting worse the longer I stayed, so I objected when the officiant asked. Tina was furious, but I told her that things just didn’t feel right and I only wanted to help her and Henry. She told me that she didn’t even invite me and that I had no right to interfere in her life like that before kicking me out.

I was really hurt by what Tina said to me, but I’m giving her some space to think before I try talking to her again.

29,1cd8cc5,WIBTA if I moved out of my college apartment with our jointly-owned cats?,"I (24F) live with two other roommates, one of them my age and then her older sister. We have lived together for almost 5 years. We get along pretty good, except for her older sister and I are both introverted and don't necessarily click well.

A year and a half ago, we came into ownership of two kittens. At the time, we had no real plans to move out or separate, as we have a pretty good living situation. I take care of the cats primarily as I work from home; I feed them, groom them (brush and trim their nails), clean up after them (vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, etc), play with them, cuddle them, etc. My two roommates' only responsibility is to take care of the litter box - which they fail to do oftentimes and I am stuck cleaning up the litter box for them.

The cats have chosen me as their favorite person. Even when my roommates are home, they are attached to me at the hip.

Our landlord has recently informed us that he plans on selling the property. He offered to sell it directly to us, but it's marked ridiculously high that we couldn't afford the mortgage even if we evenly split it. So - we're faced with either moving out, or praying that the new owners will not jack up rent prices or kick us out.

I believe our current landlord would let us break our lease early and move to avoid the hassle of showing a house with tenants occupying it. I want to live on my own and I would like to take the cats with me.

However, I think they are attached to the cats similarly to me. The cats are legally mine; their adoption paperwork and microchips are in my name.

30,1cd8c8v,AITA for not saying much after my friend cut a guy off?,"so i (16f) am friends with someone (15f) who we’ll call jess. jess and i have been friends for a few years now, and we love talking to each other. 

recently (about 3 weeks ago), jess started talking to this guy. of course, i was all for it, because i love to see my friend happy. during the time she was talking to the guy, though, he was all she’d talk about - not exaggerating. from day to night, for those 2-3 weeks, the main topic of conversation was the guy she was talking to, and i’m sure you can predict that i was starting to get tired of it soon enough. 

less than half of the times in that whole time period did she ever ask about how i was doing or what was going on in my life, probably less than 10. even when she did, she’d usually just go back to talking about the boy again a couple messages after. that kinda hurt me, because i always make sure to ask her how she’s doing and what’s going on with her before i start talking to her.

so, today, jess messages me and tells me she cut him off because something felt off to her. i kind of just started at the message, because this was the same guy i feel she was kind of neglecting me for. i’ll admit, my responses were kind of dry, but i didn’t really know what to say in that situation because she would always talk about how she liked him so much then she suddenly ended things. along with that, i was kind of busy when she was telling me all of this, too, but i don’t think how occupied i was would’ve changed what i said. 

after a couple of messages back and forth about how she cut this guy off and why, she asks if she messed up. i said “i don’t know” because i honestly didn’t - this was her relationship, not mine. i barely even know who the guy is. after i say that, she responds with “nvm then”. when i tried to message her a couple hours later, she texted like she was mad at me for not giving her a better response.

 I have just started swimming classes, so I was feeling a lot hungrier than normal when dinner arrived. We sat down to watch netflix, she offered her sandwich and I took a bite out of it, then I offered mine. She took a bite that seemed proportionally much larger than the one I took, and I (again, I was very hungry) said something on the lines of ""Whoa, you took too big of a bite for someone who's just sampling it"". I could tell she did not find it funny, so I just explained that if I'm biting into someone elses food I try to go for the smallest bite possible and then I did not press the issue any further, but I also said that I wasn't really angry about the bite. It could have just looked a big bite from my angle or it could be that I was just hungry. For me it was solved immediately: I made a comment, she did not like that, I won't insist, it's fine.   


But during the episode she got non-verbal and stopped interacting with me, giving me the silent treatment, so to speak.   
At the end of the episode the silence was really weird and upsetting. We had planned to see more stuff, so after she asked what to do I told her that if she was going to stay like that I would rather not share time together because it's just unpleasant to watch stuff in a situation like that.   
So she immediately was very angry with me. She said that she was feeling huge and disgusting and masculine because of what I said. This did not make any sense to me and I was very disoriented by this reaction, So maybe I was a insensitive by asking if this was not a bit much over a comment that was made in a irreverent way about a sandwich.   


To this, she got even more upset and told me that she has issues with her weight, that she has TOLD ME that before and that I was an being an asshole by saying she eats too much.   
Another disclaimer: She has complained to me about feeling clumsy and she did mention her weight a few times, but it is not constant.

So I explained that I didn't said that she eats too much. Complaining about a large bite in an un-serious manner is absolutely not the same as saying someone eats too much. I also said I could be wrong about and just hungry, which caused the comment.  


She said that it doesn't matter. You should never say that to someone that has weight issues. I said that I was sorry, but honestly I could not know she would feel so bad.

Since arriving I have talked to him twice, not including 2 letters I have received from him. His phone is broken so if he gets to call it is from an unknown number because he is using a battle Buddy’s phone. 
I work as a cashier in a very small town near a high traffic freeway. We get a lot of truck drivers and travelers coming through our town. That being said my Boss is a total duchebag and has zero compassion or empathy for his employees. 
Onto the situation which occurred 2 weeks ago, I was working at the counter next to my boss during a large rush of people came into the store. In the middle of this rush I realized I was being called on my cellphone, I knew I couldn’t run off because I would probably be fired. Once the rush was over I told my boss I missed a very important phone call and asked if I could go call back. He said not now, that he had to run to the back office. 5 minutes later he came back up and said I could go call back. I walked out of the store and called the number back twice, to no answer. I then called my mom crying telling her the situation having an anxiety attack. After about 5 minutes I walked back into the store still freaking out (I have severe anxiety and didn’t have my meds to help calm me down so I was visibly distraught and still teary eyed). My boss asked what the phone call was about so I told him the situation, how I had possibly missed the chance to speak to my boyfriend and was very upset about it. My boss then went on a tangent about how I can’t just run away from the counter in the middle of a rush to answer a call and how it was very unprofessional of me to walk away from the counter when I was needed to “talk to some boy” mind you my boyfriend and I had lived together for over 6 months before he left and my boss was well aware of this. He is not “some boy” in any capacity.

I left that day apologizing to the girl because I think I was just as shocked as she was, and she said it would be a lot on her bucket to carry that role anyways.

      When I got home I checked my email to see the day prior the project had been approved and the girl was happy to start and wanted volunteers for a start. I feel like I took someone's position, I feel terribly guilty, and I want to apologize again tomorrow for my ignorance, as I cross paths with her a few times a day. 

     I want to go into the the specific councils purpose for my career, (I don't know about the girl), so this is mainly my way of getting a head start. AITA for ""stealing"" the election? Do I contact this girl and apologize?",0.0,0.1092413,0,1

I currently work at a medical office where I've been for over a year now. When I started this job I was told it could be done completely from home. Quickly that changed.

The reason I work from home is because this job is a 2 hour drive from my home. I currently only go in once a week, I've denied them when they asked if I could come in more. 

But now I've expressed to my boss that I would like an evaluation and I plan to ask for a raise (I plan to ask for $12 an hour but we'll see). This evaluation hasn't even happened and I'm being asked again to come in 3 days a week.

36,1cd7xdb,AITA for telling my uncle off about not selling my late mother's piano on my birthday?,"I 27 (m) just celebrated my 27th birthday with my brother who also is 27 years old on April 20th and we had a wonderful time. We had immediate family come over and celebrate our birthday before I and my twin went and celebrated on our own. 

I just had cake, cupcakes, and alcohol when the mood of the party took a turn for the worst. 

For context My uncle is someone who is a massive pain in my ass when it comes to my life, he thinks that it would be more efficient to tell my dad how to live our lives, especially when it comes to our house. For context, my dad is having renovation in our house and he’s trying to upgrade the sub-basement in our house to look presentable. I tried to explain my feelings to my uncle who is a male in his early 50s who cannot grasp the concept that we are not a typical family. I am a young man who still lives with his dad because of my autism. 

So how did this connect with my mother‘s piano you may ask? Well, my mother died in 2012 because of cancer and the piano is her last possession and I am very connected to this instrument. It was on my birthday last week that my uncle suggested that we sell the piano for money without even consulting, my father, me, or my brother. he reasoned that she was dead, and I and my brother had to get over that my heart sank Her death was over 12 years ago and I cannot seem to get over the fact that he made the awful suggestion that I have to sell this piano that she spent over $1200 and she would play every single day.

I should let you know that both my aunt and uncle are right-wing extremists who shamed me for being bisexual and being myself. They judged my every move. 

They are not good people even tho they are Evangelical Christians. 

I thought to myself he is an asshole. Why would he make that kind of suggestion, knowing that I was very close to my mother.?

So am I the asshole for calling out my uncle and telling him that I will not sell the piano because it’s too sentimental?

A bit of context...
In my childhood, I had a happy life, parents together who seemed to be fine, a brother and a family that loved me. As time went by, my parents had problems, they divorced, so my brother and I stayed with my mom in the same house where we had lived since we were little. The relationship with my Father at that time was very good but gradually deteriorated because he made his life and without realizing it, he pushed me and my brother aside.

Returning to the present, that house was always being fought over by my parents, on one hand, my mom wanting to leave it at my brother and I names, and on the other hand, my dad wanting to take it away and sell it. In the end, due to problems with the lawyers and a trial in which my mom did not show up because she was never notified, the judge ended up ruling in favor of my dad and part of his family (because they were also behind everything), we were just notified that we had 7 days to leave the house or we would be forcibly removed. We did what we could but in the end, they kicked us out in a horrible way because both my dad's lawyer and those they hired treated us like the worst.

Maybe I didn't give all the context, but I know that despite everything my dad didn't want to hurt us even though he did it in the worst way. He didn't care what we felt, he didn't care what we thought, he didn't care about anything other than his hatred and contempt towards my mom and dragged us in the worst possible way... He wants to fix things but neither he nor his family apologized to my brother and me for what they did to us, somehow he believes it's okay and that ""it was all my mom's fault"" even though he orchestrated everything so the only thing they did was act as if nothing had happened. He says he wants to mend things and fix the relationship with us to the point that he bought me a car and gave us some money but I simply don't see it possible, not only do I have a lot of remorse towards him but it makes me uncomfortable and quite depressed to be with someone who was capable of doing all the harm he did to me just because he felt a lot of resentment towards someone who wasn't me (in this case, my mom).

41,1cd78qp,AITA - Graduation Tickets,"Background - I had a child with someone 17 years ago that I am no longer with. I married my current husband when our child was 3 years old. From birth to 3 years old, my child's father was uninvolved, however his family was VERY involved. He has never paid child support ($100 per month),often avoided employment to not pay, and was arrested due to non payment.

 Although my family (husband & kids) lived in different states due to my husband's job, our child would visit their father for summers and Christmas holiday. We moved back to the same city as him 5 years ago and while he is still unemployed (just working gig work here and there), he sees our child every other weekend and 1 month in the summer. He is able to do that with the help of family and friends (staying with them when the child visits).

Current Situation  - Our child is graduating next month and we only get 10 tickets to split. I have allocated three tickets for him (1 for my child's father, and two more for family on his side that have really supported the child--- his parents cannot attend). The other 7 are for the 5 people that live in the house with the child (my husband, myself, and my other kids), the other 2 are for my mother and father (they are divorced) --- They supported me fully with our child. My child's father is upset that I do not split the tickets evenly ... 5&5. At the very least, he said my mother could go but he wants a 4th ticket for a close family member that would travel from out of town. I told him, "" Unfortunately, everyone that deserves to go will not be able to attend.""  I love this family member and if I had more tickets, they would go. 

The school is small and will likely not be able to allow for more tickets, but I have already requested. I also suggested that my child's father take the child and the people of their choice out for lunch after graduation as I planned to do a BBQ for my family that couldn't attend.

42,1cd773c,"AITA for wanting to share our pregnancy news with my parents, without my wife","Me (37m) and my wife (33f) learned that she is about 8 weeks pregnant. We are delighted but also terrified. It is the first time for both of us.

  
She has asked me to not share the news with anyone until we get to about 12 weeks, when the pregnancy will be stable. So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month. 

  
She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information. She did share it with her parents, and they were overjoyed – the house is in a festive mood, they cannot stop smiling and laughing, etc.

  
I am still under an information embargo though.  
(note: I did ask her to let me share with a couple of select people, for my own mental sanity, since I really needed to be able to open up to a friend. She was fine with it)

  
Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I.

  
I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same ‘joyous family moment’ like she did. 

  
My wife took it badly.  
I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever. 

  
She is very upset. I reminded her that we did not announce to \*her\* parents jointly. She is saying that I did not express any desire to do so (which is true, I did not even think of it) … but since she is clearly communicating \*her\* desire to me, it is different, and I should hear her. Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole?

Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole? 

  
Note: she and my parents do not share a common language and communicate via translator app

43,1cd7102,AITA for throwing out sentimental stuff in an insensitive way?,"My younger sister was decluttering her room and part of it was deciding to get rid of like half her stuffed animals. They weren't really in condition to donate so the plan was to throw them out and I offered to take care of that when my sis was done.

My mom had also asked me to take out the trash from the baby room so I did what I thought was the simplest thing: took the pile of stuffies my sister had okayed to get rid of, put it in with the baby trash and took that bag down to the outside bin.

My sister ended up seeing it in the bin later and she got mad at me for doing it that way. She wasn't supposed to see it that way but my mom said I was insensitive for not keeping it separate. Honestly I don't really understand the problem, but I'm a little autistic so I don't always know what the standard is.

44,1cd6xg5,AITA for not wanting to cover my friend's husband shift the week of when their baby is due?,"I f(26) have been working for this small Korean family business for the past year. I was approached by my friend who is pregnant and her husband a year ago asking if I was willing to work for her dad's company. Her husband, Steve, said the company would hold my hand through it all and reassured I didn't need any experience in the field. At the time I had just recently quit a toxic job while also living in a toxic household. I didn't really think of it much and agreed because I honestly needed the money. The company was small and only had 5 employees including myself. The Boss (friend's dad), Floor manager (her husband), Accountant (her mom), Main Manager (dad's friend) and me. I found myself having to figure out everything as Steve was too busy to mentor me. They expected me to work during our lunch. ""We as a company need to prioritize the clients and must give the best services at all cost."" The work increased by a lot and it was clear I was not fitted to take this amount of work this early that required a lot more steps. I asked for help but was told to pull through. I started making mistakes, I got in trouble and then the yelling started for not knowing the steps even though the company has not handled this client before. I was told I didn't work fast enough, and needed to stay after hours to work to finish work. The boss yelled, saying how dumb I was, that I didn't have any common sense, everything was my fault. He continued to yell at me in Korean. I did not understand what he was saying, but he was using his gesture to mock me. I gathered my stuff and went downstairs and saw my friend sitting there waiting for her husband. I was embarrassed. My boss and wife would get extremely upset for the smallest things. I was belittled, mocked, and they made sure to tell their clients I wasn't Korean. I was being micromanaged for everything. I was set up to be given all the terrible clients, I was set for failure. I cried everyday. I started having panic attacks driving home, couldn't sleep, and started having nightmares. To top it off, the HR was Steve. There would be times when Steve would standing up for me but would also say I need to take the blame for everything even if the client is wrong, or if the boss was upset he would make sure to tell me that when the boss came in to just keep my head down, and work quietly. My friend will be due next week and Steve is expecting me to take over his workload so he can be with his wife and baby but his work is completed different than what I’m handling and I cant bare the thought of being yelled at again. I am planning on quitting tomorrow and I want to know if what I am doing is right. I do feel guilty that my friend’s husband might not be able to be with his family due to me quitting.
