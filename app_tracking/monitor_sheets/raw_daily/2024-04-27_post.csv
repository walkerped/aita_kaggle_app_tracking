0,1ceoyep,AITA For Asking My Mom To Respect My Name Change Via Text,"I (22NB) recently told my mom (57F) that I will be changing my name, and from this point onward would like her to respect my name choices. By this point, I had also texted my grandma (79F) about the same topic and she reacted kindly and supportively. My mom on the other hand absolutely blew up on me. She said ‚Äúwhat you say is love feels like hate‚Äù and that this topic has made her ‚Äúmean spirited.‚Äù She was also upset to have ‚Äútext bombs lobbed into her life‚Äù and requested I write her a letter to be exchanged with her on a future date. I don‚Äôt see how this is much different from texting her as I did in the first place. 

Was I really TA for this? I‚Äôve been going by my chosen name for 3 years now, and she is aware that everyone in my life except for my family calls me by my chosen name. In addition to this, I picked this name when I was 12, and had about a year of me telling my parents I was going to legally change my name once I became an adult, although I dropped that idea until I was 19. In my mind, I was simply reinforcing a reality she was already aware of, not dropping new information on her, but now I feel like I may have irreparably damaged our relationship. 

I‚Äôm really unsure of how to proceed. If I am TA I will absolutely apologize, I just don‚Äôt think I am simply for requesting my choices be respected. I texted her because I did not want my grandma to tell her before I could, and also because in my mind I‚Äôm informing her of something, not opening the floor up for debate, as my identity is not negotiable. 

I am nonbinary, and in addition to that am named after an Ayn Ryand character (those of you who know who that is may understand why I want to change my name) and so my name change is pretty important to me.

1,1ce5e2l,AITA for helping my female co worker with moving favors?,"For context: I am a maintenance director and my female coworker is another director at a senior living building. We have worked together for 5 years and we recently were put together to run this building by the owners. 

We are both the same age, mid 20‚Äôs - and I have been dating a girl for going on 4 years with no problems so far everything has been great in the relationship. This coworker, let‚Äôs call her Emma, has just bought a house and is moving. Also, Emma doesn‚Äôt have much support around her, she‚Äôs widowed, works more than I do and is putting herself through college part time. She could use the help with tasks such as installing appliances, hanging curtains, pictures etc. and I have offered to help after work a few days to help free of charge. 

Most of my job contains those tasks as a maintenance man so of course I usually get asked to do small maintenance favors for coworkers from time to time. My gf has never really had an issue with any of the side work I‚Äôve done even though there‚Äôs been other ladies of various ages.  My gf is not generally jealous but she has a huge issue with me (along with other coworkers) helping Emma pack and help move, and me returning to help with curtains and tvs. Am I wrong to help this coworker ? My girlfriend is not accusing me of trying to cheat or anything but she is saying I‚Äôm crossing her boundaries of going to another ladies house. Emma has her sister and her sister boyfriend living with her and they are there 24/7, so we are never alone together. We get all get along great and it‚Äôs more like hanging with friends than anything.

 I promise I am not the type to be unfaithful and I have never given her a reason to suspend otherwise but she says she doesn‚Äôt trust my ability to shut down inappropriate behavior. 
Keep in mind Emma seems to have zero interest in me or dating for that reason , considering she‚Äôs recently widowed. I love my gf very much and wish she would lay off on me trying to do a good deed, what advice does anyone have on how to handle the situation?

4,1ce52il,AITA for saying no to giving a birthday gift from my mom to her granddaughter? ,"My (36) brother (38) and I have a tumultuous relationship but are acting as joint Power of Attorneys and Executors of our mother‚Äôs (66) Will. 

Our mother has been in a care facility with severe MS and early onset dementia for the last 2 years. I live in a different province while my brother lives in the same city. 

He lived with our mom rent free before she went into care and yet it was my aunts and uncles that eventually phoned me to address their concerns with her health. They even questioned how healthy them living together was. Him and I have never had a relationship for many reasons. 

When she went into care we found out she had significant debt and we sold her condo to pay it off and she now has a fixed amount to pay for her care and accommodation until she passes. What is in her accounts is all that‚Äôs left. 

My brother has always been terrible with money. Even after everything she has done for him, I see he pays himself back from her account for say $20 he spends on her soft drinks she requests. Something I find petty. 

My stance is every penny she has is to be used to support herself until she passes. This has not stopped him from asking to borrow money for a down payment, to invest, money to cover stolen tools, etc. all of which I have denied. This last request has me questioning if I‚Äôm the asshole though. 

Today he said he visited mom and she wanted to give him $500 for a birthday gift for my 15 year old niece. I immediately said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with this. That in my son‚Äôs 2 years of life (she‚Äôs not all there so I don‚Äôt blame her) she has not given him one gift, let alone all the time and memories my children won‚Äôt have with her. When he was born she offered $500 to buy him a crib but I refused. 

I told him I thought it was best if we just leave it, as I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to my children and I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in her best interest to be spending $500 on birthday gifts. 

As expected he absolutely lost it. Yelling at me that they were always close (she was the only grandchild for 13 years), that she‚Äôs struggling with her grandma being in the hospital (she hasn‚Äôt visited her in years), asking if I wanted to be responsible for not giving her a gift and that I was an asshole because this wasn‚Äôt about me and him but about her.

6,1ce4z5x,AITA for wanting to confront roommate about bf staying over a lot (again)? Complicated by rent situation.,"Basics: Rent is 3k. We pay 1800 and roomie pays 1200 with utilities split 3 ways.

~2mo ago I had been wanting to talk about her bf being over a ton for a while because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own place. I feel like I need to cover up a bit more and am hesitant to being in the kitchen because I frequently hear them having loud sex. We don‚Äôt really use the living room because her dog makes it hard (not his fault, we are allergic to him. Does suck tho because that rly limits the space we share). Both of us usually work 4a-2p. He is over in the afternoon and usually sleeps over fri-sun. We addressed it when she asked us to continue our lease (done soon) with a month to month contract. To me, this is a yes or no question. Never did I say I want to adjust anything about our current lease, but if she wanted to basically ask us to continue being her roommates, I said I‚Äôd only consider if we paid rent more evenly. She could‚Äôve just said no, but instead she decided to call us names and accuse us of being shitty, shady, and extorting her for money. She had recently stated she was moving out and got flyers from other complexes - assuming she felt she and her bf hadn‚Äôt been together long enough to cohabitate. We decided since she‚Äôs moving out, we could swap her out for our new roomie. Note that this isn‚Äôt a secret process, she‚Äôd have to sign off. She asked what our plans were and we said staying here with a roomie (also, my fianc√©e had told her this the week before) and she got upset and said we betrayed her and we‚Äôre awful for deciding this bc she thinks she may now want to stay with bf - after going back and forth I conceded and said ‚Äúnot worth arguing, you guys stay.

She later suggested that they could stay a bit more at his place. This lasted maybe a week(?). All of the bf stuff got mixed in with the rent discussion so I don‚Äôt think she took it seriously.

For context on the codependency, she literally cannot do anything without someone doing it for her or with her. Thats it. Everything. Dishes, paper work, home work, getting from place A to B. She‚Äôll miss important meetings because someone was unavailable to go with her. She can‚Äôt keep a job because she‚Äôs a stick it to the man kind of person (she can afford to be this person because her parents pay for everything) she gets fired within days. I‚Äôve gone on strike from helping her because she‚Äôs a very take take take kind of person who doesn‚Äôt offer anything in return. 

Anyways, she got this booking- I took her to the meet and greet in the middle of my work day and we were there for over an hour and I told her hey we gotta go I have work to do and it‚Äôs still a 30 minute drive home. So we left and on our way home she asked if we could stop somewhere else and I said no I need to go home and she said ‚Äúwell how else am I supposed to get back down here‚Äù and I again said no I have to get back to work. Pissed me off.

I (24F) have a roommate (23F) who is very codependent. She got a house sitting gig and she will be paid over $1000 for the 5 days she‚Äôs house sitting. 

For context on the codependency, she literally cannot do anything without someone doing it for her or with her. Thats it. Everything. Dishes, paper work, home work, getting from place A to B. She‚Äôll miss important meetings because someone was unavailable to go with her. She can‚Äôt keep a job because she‚Äôs a stick it to the man kind of person (she can afford to be this person because her parents pay for everything) she gets fired within days. I‚Äôve gone on strike from helping her because she‚Äôs a very take take take kind of person who doesn‚Äôt offer anything in return. 

Anyways, she got this booking- I took her to the meet and greet in the middle of my work day and we were there for over an hour and I told her hey we gotta go I have work to do and it‚Äôs still a 30 minute drive home. So we left and on our way home she asked if we could stop somewhere else and I said no I need to go home and she said ‚Äúwell how else am I supposed to get back down here‚Äù and I again said no I have to get back to work.

9,1ce4hlw,"AITA? Roommate is mad I haven't spent much time with her over the past month, and that I spend more time with my new gf than her.","I am 20M in a stressful college major with a 20F roommate. Roommate mentioned a few times that we hadn't hung out recently and she was somewhat sad about it. I expressed that I was extremely busy with my school/research obligations, but apologized and said it was nothing personal.After, I invited her a few times to come and study with me. She declined all of my invitations. This was just after spring break and tensions weren't bad at all, we would talk while in the apartment and catch up daily at the very least. I still had some free time, but spent most of it with my best friend who I don't live with, or by myself to recharge because I am introverted.

\~2 weeks after spring break I started talking to a girl whom I had feelings for my freshman year. We became closer and some of the free time I spent by myself I decided to spend with her. We are in the same classes and she has no problem studying with me, so we also spend a lot of time together that way.

One night I came home and found my roommate crying. I asked if there was anything I could do but she told me to go away. I texted her and said that if she needed to talk or vent to me about anything I would always be available and just to let me know. She never responded to this text. For nearly a week we didn't talk and anytime I saw her she completely ignored me. My thought was that it would be best to give her space if she was angry with me or going through something entirely different, as I had let her know she had my support anytime.

Eventually she texted me back and said she was sorry for not responding and being distant. I told her not to worry about it at all and if she wanted to talk about things I was absolutely available. When we talked she let me know she felt like I wasn't being a good friend. I acknowledged that I had incredibly busy, and apologized that I had made her feel that way. I suggested that we could watch GOT that weekend and grab some food as a way to make up for it. She was happy with this but when I mentioned my new relationship she immediately got mad again and told me I could do way better than the girl I am seeing (who is a friend of her friend).

Later that week, I was hanging out with gf at her house when roommate (who has my location) told me to call her.  She asked if I could bring her a sprite. I was more than a mile away and it was about midnight. I didn't feel like ditching my girlfriend just to bring my roommate a sprite. I told her to try the vending machine downstairs but that I would walk over with gf and grab a sprite if she needed me to. She declined and said we needed to speak alone.

I told her we could have a conversation and the next day when we talked, she started crying and told me I am a terrible friend and roommate and I dont make any effort or reciprocate the nice things she does for me, and she effectively told me she wasn't my friend anymore.

They are saying that that is the only time they all can play(There are 9 of them). I asked if they can just play without me, but they said I had agreed to do it weeks before (I didn‚Äôt). He also says that he‚Äôs spent a long time planning this and I will ruin it if I don‚Äôt go (I don‚Äôt understand why)?

12,1ce3sft,AITA for arguing with the lifeguard at my local pool?,"Throwaway because my friends know my usual account. I (37F) was at our local community centre pool today with my 3 children. For this post I will change their names, but they are Jane (3) Alison (5) and Henry (8).

Going to the pool is a regular outing for us. Sometimes we go with my husband but today he was at work, so I took them by myself. I got the kids ready in the family change room area, and entered the pool area. Henry is a great swimmer so I often let him watch Alison not far away from me in an area of the pool that is slightly over their heads. There are also at least 2 lifeguards watching this pool all the times. Jane prefers to stay in the shallower area of the pool, so I usually stay over there with her. 

Well today I was sitting in the shallow area with Jane as I usually do, while Alison and Henry swam a little further away in the deeper area of the pool. (This pool does not have a normal layout, it is meant for kids so it has a lazy river which is about 4 feet deep, a basketball court area which is 5 feet deep, and a baby area which is kind of like a beach).

 One of the lifeguards yelled at me to ‚Äúbe in arms reach of all my kids‚Äù. She was very rude, so I told her we swim here all the time and it has never been a problem. She told me that they were too young to swim in this section alone. I pointed out that it was a kids pool and they are good swimmers but she still said they couldn‚Äôt swim without an adult until they are 12. So I put Jane in a float and went over there with them even thought Jane was not happy about it.

Alison and Henry were playing on big floating pool toys about 5 feet away from me and I was just keeping Jane occupied, since she doesnt like being in the deeper water. 

Well Alison fell off the floaty she was playing with while I was playing with Jane, and the next thing I know the lifeguard is blowing her whistle and jumping in after Alison. She handed her to me (looking kind of pissed off). I told her she didn‚Äôt need to get in and that Alison can swim plus Henry was watching her. 

The lifeguard said ‚Äúwell she wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and then told me that if I wanted to keep swimming I had to put my children in lifejackets.

I told her that was ridiculous because my children can swim, plus she is obviously there to save them in case they need help. I left shortly after, but am I the asshole for not wanting to put them in lifejackets and expecting the lifeguards to actually do their jobs?

I made an off the cuff joke without thinking and blurted out, ""But Mom‚Äôs not  at a football match."" Almost immediately, the mood in the room shifted and everyone shared how they felt that what I said was not nice before my mom began to cry and started heading back to her room. She came back later to talk to me where she reminded me about her insecurity that she had about being told she was dumb because she was told that all her life and as a kid as well as that it hurt that it hurt that it was *her son* telling her these things. my dad came in later to tell me that it was rude because of how directed it was towards.

I have realized that I may have made a mistake in speaking before I thought and so frivolously and not recognizing/remembering my mom's insecurities.

I do think I should've chosen someone else, though I did just reach the hand om my mind into an imaginary hat and pull out a random name which happened to be hers.

TL;DR: I called my mom a dummy as a joke which hit an insecurity I didn't think of and that it hurt to hear that from her son.

14,1ce3n2t,WIBTA if I left my grandparent's anniversary early to attend a friend's exhibit?,"I (21F) graduated college early and have been living at home with my parents and grandparents before starting grad school. I have been living at home for my entire life, even during college, so I never really had a college experience, especially with the pandemic. I never really went out or partied unless it was to support a friend's accomplishment and even then, I tell my parents in advance where and who I am going with.

I have known for a couple of months that my close childhood friend would be hosting a group art exhibit. This is her first and last exhibit as a senior in college and I have been looking forward to it, knowing how hard she worked to curate it. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, I learned that my grandparents would be celebrating their anniversary with my dad's side of the family (what luck it lands on the same day as my friend's exhibit). I was never formally told (found out through my sister who was also forced to come even though she has finals). Additionally, I don't like my dad's side of the family since they always ignore me and are incredibly judgmental/competitive, especially my cousin who just started college. My baby cousins will also be coming and I know I will be stuck babysitting them the entire time, since my sister will be studying for her finals (and maybe my judgey cousin).

I am frustrated to say the least because my family never tells me anything until the last minute and expects me to drop everything at the last minute (this is not the first time this has happened; the same thing happened during my college graduation when we left before I could say goodbye to my friends). 

My plan would be to stay for lunch (since that is what my grandparents wanted) and leave afterward to attend my friend's exhibit. I thought this was a reasonable compromise, but I was immediately shut down by my parents. I do try to take into consideration their feelings, but because of that, I feel like I missed out on being young/free and hanging out with people my age, especially since I will be starting grad school soon.

TW: talk of mental illnesses

I (20f) and my mother (53f) are currently at odds sort of.

For background recently I have gotten a diagnosis for BPD(borderline personality disorder) the assessment talked about a lot of things but mainly how my childhood was, due to what was in it I didn‚Äôt want my mother to read it cuz if she did she would be extremely upset to the point that she would have a big breakdown.

So I hid it then had a talk with my mother about how I did have the diagnosis but I don‚Äôt want her reading it she seemed okay with that saying she won‚Äôt and that I could trust her.

Unfortunately didn‚Äôt go that way I had to scan the documents onto my laptop because of government funding stuff and put it in a file which you would need to basically go snooping to find which she did and read it.

I was on the couch not aware of what she was doing on my laptop when she suddenly got up saying she had to go I grabbed the laptop cuz gaming lol and saw my document open I asked my mother about it and she said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this many questions rn‚Äù and stormed to her room. 
Later you could hear crying all around the house and that‚Äôs when I knew what she did.

The next day she asked me to hug her I was unsure but went and did so, during the hug she went I‚Äôm sorry I did lie to you yesterday.

Then she started going on that some information about my childhood was wrong and how I shouldn‚Äôt say some of the stuff to the person and her saying for me to go ahead and talk to my sister about how much of a bad mother she is for reading my assessment when I asked about her saying I could trust her.

Ever since then I don‚Äôt know how to feel, our current dynamic is like nothing has changed but inside I feel a lot of turmoil and I find it hard to give her a silent treatment or anything and people are saying I should forgive her cuz she is just trying to be a better mother and she has already have a child that has cut her off but I don‚Äôt like that explanation.

So today with Mother‚Äôs Day around the corner I don‚Äôt know if I should get her anything but if I don‚Äôt get her anything my feelings would be evident even though I have been acting normal around her, so WIBTA?

We decided to have a pot luck and all bring in home made food. Pot luck day arrives and everyone is raving about this Agua Fresca that a coworker made. When it's my turn to try it I pour it out of the jug and the lid comes off and the Agua Fresca spills all over the counter, desk, myself, my shoes etc. I was shocked and I ran to clean it. After it's clean we all eat and the 24/F that made it starts questioning me for the rest of the day. 'How could you be so dumb and not know how to pour juice' 'next time you should ask' 'Thank you for ruining our pot luck and our day' 'I didn't even bring the juice for you and you had to ruin it as always' ' I  didn't even make it for you in the first place' ' I stayed up until 11 PM to make this and you ruined it' Mind you,  there is still a full jar left.

I could relate because I have two cats that help with my own anxiety. After she moved states, we stayed connected through Facebook, mainly reacting to each other's posts.

Jessica often posted her CashApp and Venmo details on Facebook, asking for money for pet food, toys, and even rent. Despite having a decent job, she seemed to manage her finances poorly, which I found odd. I usually ignored these types of posts.

The incident: One day, I saw a post about Jessica‚Äôs cat needing emergency surgery after a neighbors dog attacked her, costing about $2000. She asked facebook for financial help. I messaged her, suggesting that the dog's owner should cover the costs. She explained the owner was broke and her cat urgently needed surgery. Feeling sympathetic, I sent her $600 from my savings.

I hinted that I expected the money back if her neighbor paid. A few days later, Jessica posted that her neighbor had indeed paid the full $2000, avoiding court. I congratulated her but later asked about getting my $600 back. She seemed confused and insisted it was a donation, needed now for her cat‚Äôs recovery and other essentials.

I was shocked. I tried to clarify that my intention was to loan the money for the surgery, not give it away for other uses. She called me a horrible friend and blocked me on Facebook. As a college student, $600 is a significant amount for me.

As in, we talk/see each other maybe once or twice a year because we went to college in different states and now live in different states. Since forever we've known that we were gonna be the maid of honors in each others' weddings. 

Well her fiance (26M) proposed to her last summer and she asked me (basically told me) I was gonna be the maid of honor in her wedding this December. It was a really fun and exciting idea at the time (who doesn't want to be in a wedding?) but as time has gone on, we've been in contact more in the last few months than we have in years, because of the wedding planning, and I've realized that we're not as close as I thought we've been all this time. 

For one, she's being a bit of a bridezilla, which is fine and a bit expected, but still annoying nonetheless. In a controlling and kind of ungrateful way. Like, when people plan things on her behalf (engagement party, shower, etc) it always seems like she's unhappy with the results and acts like it, but refuses to admit it. 
I'm planning her bachelorette party and I've slowly started to realize that I don't know her quite as well as I thought I did. And I've also come to the sad thought that, maybe I don't love her enough to be her maid of honor. Which, women know, you have to really love someone to put up with the shit maid of honors deal with, like covering extra costs, putting in the extra time, effort, and just all around concern for the couple.

26,1ce1bik,"AITA for telling my mom that if she wants a servant so bad, she can either hire one, or pay me?","I (20M) still live with my mom (42F). I know it's generally seen as weird to still be an adult and living with my mom, but unfortunately, it's for money reasons. It's a lot easier to live together and contribute to the bills than find a place on my own, or with roommates. If I could, I'd have moved out a long time ago. Anyway, I'd like to start this by saying my mother is incredibly lazy. I'm not saying that in a physical sense, because she works out as much as she can. She doesn't like doing *anything* for herself. I need to bring her snacks, I need to get her water, I need to get her meds, I need to go to the store, I need to do her laundry, I need to do *everything* for her. Unless I'm not at home, considering I work full time, just like her. The minute I wake up, to the minute I go to sleep, I'm basically her personal servant. She works from home. I work during the week and have weekends off, and so does she. I clean every single day, and she cleans MAYBE on Sundays, but she only cleans her room. According to her, I'm responsible for every mess in the house (excluding her room), so it's my job to clean it, despite basically never being home. After work she reads or watches TV, after work I continue to work. I basically have to beg to have a day off to relax. 

I should mention that I do pay expenses too. I contribute $200 a month towards utilities and phone bills. She hasn't asked for more, and I'm sure as hell not offering her more. 

Being her personal servant has taken a physical toll on me. I've had a hip condition since 2020, and the work has only made it worse. All the going up and down stairs, back and forth from her room to the kitchen to the living room, etc. I legitimately get yelled at if I don't come fast enough when she summons me. She invades my room and refuses to leave if I'm too slow. She rarely cooks dinner, it's ever rarer that she'd do something for me if I asked. The only time she took care of me was after my unsuccessful hip surgery, and even then I had to quit my crutches a week early to keep up with her demands. I understand that I'm an adult, but I'm fucking exhausted. Whenever I try to bring up how unfair this is, I always get the ""I'm the mother, you're the child. Its a privilege that you still get to live here"" excuse. My final straw was a few days ago, when she yelled at me for not filling up her water before I went to bed, and she woke up thirsty. I yelled at her that if she wanted a fucking servant so badly, she could either hire one, or pay me the amount she could hire one for. She then got more pissed off, and told me if I didn't like living here, I could leave, and live in my own filth. 

I'm now looking for higher paying jobs so I can start saving up to move out. 

Note: When I turned 18, she gave me two options for continuing to live with her; either work full time, or go to school full time. I decided to work, and go to school later, so I could save up money and not have to take out as many student loans.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-27,"AITA for telling my mom that if she wants a servant so bad, she can either hire one, or pay me? I (20M) still live with my mom (42F). I know it's generally seen as weird to still be an adult and living with my mom, but unfortunately, it's for money reasons. It's a lot easier to live together and contribute to the bills than find a place on my own, or with roommates. If I could, I'd have moved out a long time ago. Anyway, I'd like to start this by saying my mother is incredibly lazy. I'm not saying that in a physical sense, because she works out as much as she can. She doesn't like doing *anything* for herself. I need to bring her snacks, I need to get her water, I need to get her meds, I need to go to the store, I need to do her laundry, I need to do *everything* for her. Unless I'm not at home, considering I work full time, just like her. The minute I wake up, to the minute I go to sleep, I'm basically her personal servant. She works from home. I work during the week and have weekends off, and so does she. I clean every single day, and she cleans MAYBE on Sundays, but she only cleans her room. According to her, I'm responsible for every mess in the house (excluding her room), so it's my job to clean it, despite basically never being home. After work she reads or watches TV, after work I continue to work. I basically have to beg to have a day off to relax. 

I should mention that I do pay expenses too. I contribute $200 a month towards utilities and phone bills. She hasn't asked for more, and I'm sure as hell not offering her more. 

Being her personal servant has taken a physical toll on me. I've had a hip condition since 2020, and the work has only made it worse. All the going up and down stairs, back and forth from her room to the kitchen to the living room, etc. I legitimately get yelled at if I don't come fast enough when she summons me. She invades my room and refuses to leave if I'm too slow. She rarely cooks dinner, it's ever rarer that she'd do something for me if I asked.

My sister (30F) and my niece (4) just moved back home after being in another state for about a year and a half. My sister really wants to move back out whenever she can but financially she can't. When she moved home I ""promised"" her that I would move out with her and my boyfriend within a years time. Well, I don't think that's going to happen now and I kinda feel horrible but also not.

She has almost no control over my niece. She practically runs the house and my sister just lets her. There is no discipline. I've never really had my own room but i finally was getting my ""own room"" as they were moving home and now they have partially taken it over. 
My niece has toys all over the house and practically terrorizes my cats. My sister has clothes all over the house. The house is the messiest it has ever been and it's all because of my sister.
