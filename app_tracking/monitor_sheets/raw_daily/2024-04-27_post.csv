0,1ceoyep,AITA For Asking My Mom To Respect My Name Change Via Text,"I (22NB) recently told my mom (57F) that I will be changing my name, and from this point onward would like her to respect my name choices. By this point, I had also texted my grandma (79F) about the same topic and she reacted kindly and supportively. My mom on the other hand absolutely blew up on me. She said ‚Äúwhat you say is love feels like hate‚Äù and that this topic has made her ‚Äúmean spirited.‚Äù She was also upset to have ‚Äútext bombs lobbed into her life‚Äù and requested I write her a letter to be exchanged with her on a future date. I don‚Äôt see how this is much different from texting her as I did in the first place. 

Was I really TA for this? I‚Äôve been going by my chosen name for 3 years now, and she is aware that everyone in my life except for my family calls me by my chosen name. In addition to this, I picked this name when I was 12, and had about a year of me telling my parents I was going to legally change my name once I became an adult, although I dropped that idea until I was 19. In my mind, I was simply reinforcing a reality she was already aware of, not dropping new information on her, but now I feel like I may have irreparably damaged our relationship. 

I‚Äôm really unsure of how to proceed. If I am TA I will absolutely apologize, I just don‚Äôt think I am simply for requesting my choices be respected. I texted her because I did not want my grandma to tell her before I could, and also because in my mind I‚Äôm informing her of something, not opening the floor up for debate, as my identity is not negotiable. 

I am nonbinary, and in addition to that am named after an Ayn Ryand character (those of you who know who that is may understand why I want to change my name) and so my name change is pretty important to me.

1,1ce5e2l,AITA for helping my female co worker with moving favors?,"For context: I am a maintenance director and my female coworker is another director at a senior living building. We have worked together for 5 years and we recently were put together to run this building by the owners. 

We are both the same age, mid 20‚Äôs - and I have been dating a girl for going on 4 years with no problems so far everything has been great in the relationship. This coworker, let‚Äôs call her Emma, has just bought a house and is moving. Also, Emma doesn‚Äôt have much support around her, she‚Äôs widowed, works more than I do and is putting herself through college part time. She could use the help with tasks such as installing appliances, hanging curtains, pictures etc. and I have offered to help after work a few days to help free of charge. 

Most of my job contains those tasks as a maintenance man so of course I usually get asked to do small maintenance favors for coworkers from time to time. My gf has never really had an issue with any of the side work I‚Äôve done even though there‚Äôs been other ladies of various ages.  My gf is not generally jealous but she has a huge issue with me (along with other coworkers) helping Emma pack and help move, and me returning to help with curtains and tvs. Am I wrong to help this coworker ? My girlfriend is not accusing me of trying to cheat or anything but she is saying I‚Äôm crossing her boundaries of going to another ladies house. Emma has her sister and her sister boyfriend living with her and they are there 24/7, so we are never alone together. We get all get along great and it‚Äôs more like hanging with friends than anything.

 I promise I am not the type to be unfaithful and I have never given her a reason to suspend otherwise but she says she doesn‚Äôt trust my ability to shut down inappropriate behavior. 
Keep in mind Emma seems to have zero interest in me or dating for that reason , considering she‚Äôs recently widowed. I love my gf very much and wish she would lay off on me trying to do a good deed, what advice does anyone have on how to handle the situation?

4,1ce52il,AITA for saying no to giving a birthday gift from my mom to her granddaughter? ,"My (36) brother (38) and I have a tumultuous relationship but are acting as joint Power of Attorneys and Executors of our mother‚Äôs (66) Will. 

Our mother has been in a care facility with severe MS and early onset dementia for the last 2 years. I live in a different province while my brother lives in the same city. 

He lived with our mom rent free before she went into care and yet it was my aunts and uncles that eventually phoned me to address their concerns with her health. They even questioned how healthy them living together was. Him and I have never had a relationship for many reasons. 

When she went into care we found out she had significant debt and we sold her condo to pay it off and she now has a fixed amount to pay for her care and accommodation until she passes. What is in her accounts is all that‚Äôs left. 

My brother has always been terrible with money. Even after everything she has done for him, I see he pays himself back from her account for say $20 he spends on her soft drinks she requests. Something I find petty. 

My stance is every penny she has is to be used to support herself until she passes. This has not stopped him from asking to borrow money for a down payment, to invest, money to cover stolen tools, etc. all of which I have denied. This last request has me questioning if I‚Äôm the asshole though. 

Today he said he visited mom and she wanted to give him $500 for a birthday gift for my 15 year old niece. I immediately said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with this. That in my son‚Äôs 2 years of life (she‚Äôs not all there so I don‚Äôt blame her) she has not given him one gift, let alone all the time and memories my children won‚Äôt have with her. When he was born she offered $500 to buy him a crib but I refused. 

I told him I thought it was best if we just leave it, as I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to my children and I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in her best interest to be spending $500 on birthday gifts. 

As expected he absolutely lost it. Yelling at me that they were always close (she was the only grandchild for 13 years), that she‚Äôs struggling with her grandma being in the hospital (she hasn‚Äôt visited her in years), asking if I wanted to be responsible for not giving her a gift and that I was an asshole because this wasn‚Äôt about me and him but about her.

6,1ce4z5x,AITA for wanting to confront roommate about bf staying over a lot (again)? Complicated by rent situation.,"Basics: Rent is 3k. We pay 1800 and roomie pays 1200 with utilities split 3 ways.

~2mo ago I had been wanting to talk about her bf being over a ton for a while because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own place. I feel like I need to cover up a bit more and am hesitant to being in the kitchen because I frequently hear them having loud sex. We don‚Äôt really use the living room because her dog makes it hard (not his fault, we are allergic to him. Does suck tho because that rly limits the space we share). Both of us usually work 4a-2p. He is over in the afternoon and usually sleeps over fri-sun. We addressed it when she asked us to continue our lease (done soon) with a month to month contract. To me, this is a yes or no question. Never did I say I want to adjust anything about our current lease, but if she wanted to basically ask us to continue being her roommates, I said I‚Äôd only consider if we paid rent more evenly. She could‚Äôve just said no, but instead she decided to call us names and accuse us of being shitty, shady, and extorting her for money. She had recently stated she was moving out and got flyers from other complexes - assuming she felt she and her bf hadn‚Äôt been together long enough to cohabitate. We decided since she‚Äôs moving out, we could swap her out for our new roomie. Note that this isn‚Äôt a secret process, she‚Äôd have to sign off. She asked what our plans were and we said staying here with a roomie (also, my fianc√©e had told her this the week before) and she got upset and said we betrayed her and we‚Äôre awful for deciding this bc she thinks she may now want to stay with bf - after going back and forth I conceded and said ‚Äúnot worth arguing, you guys stay.

She later suggested that they could stay a bit more at his place. This lasted maybe a week(?). All of the bf stuff got mixed in with the rent discussion so I don‚Äôt think she took it seriously.

For context on the codependency, she literally cannot do anything without someone doing it for her or with her. Thats it. Everything. Dishes, paper work, home work, getting from place A to B. She‚Äôll miss important meetings because someone was unavailable to go with her. She can‚Äôt keep a job because she‚Äôs a stick it to the man kind of person (she can afford to be this person because her parents pay for everything) she gets fired within days. I‚Äôve gone on strike from helping her because she‚Äôs a very take take take kind of person who doesn‚Äôt offer anything in return. 

Anyways, she got this booking- I took her to the meet and greet in the middle of my work day and we were there for over an hour and I told her hey we gotta go I have work to do and it‚Äôs still a 30 minute drive home. So we left and on our way home she asked if we could stop somewhere else and I said no I need to go home and she said ‚Äúwell how else am I supposed to get back down here‚Äù and I again said no I have to get back to work. Pissed me off.

I (24F) have a roommate (23F) who is very codependent. She got a house sitting gig and she will be paid over $1000 for the 5 days she‚Äôs house sitting. 

For context on the codependency, she literally cannot do anything without someone doing it for her or with her. Thats it. Everything. Dishes, paper work, home work, getting from place A to B. She‚Äôll miss important meetings because someone was unavailable to go with her. She can‚Äôt keep a job because she‚Äôs a stick it to the man kind of person (she can afford to be this person because her parents pay for everything) she gets fired within days. I‚Äôve gone on strike from helping her because she‚Äôs a very take take take kind of person who doesn‚Äôt offer anything in return. 

Anyways, she got this booking- I took her to the meet and greet in the middle of my work day and we were there for over an hour and I told her hey we gotta go I have work to do and it‚Äôs still a 30 minute drive home. So we left and on our way home she asked if we could stop somewhere else and I said no I need to go home and she said ‚Äúwell how else am I supposed to get back down here‚Äù and I again said no I have to get back to work.

9,1ce4hlw,"AITA? Roommate is mad I haven't spent much time with her over the past month, and that I spend more time with my new gf than her.","I am 20M in a stressful college major with a 20F roommate. Roommate mentioned a few times that we hadn't hung out recently and she was somewhat sad about it. I expressed that I was extremely busy with my school/research obligations, but apologized and said it was nothing personal.After, I invited her a few times to come and study with me. She declined all of my invitations. This was just after spring break and tensions weren't bad at all, we would talk while in the apartment and catch up daily at the very least. I still had some free time, but spent most of it with my best friend who I don't live with, or by myself to recharge because I am introverted.

\~2 weeks after spring break I started talking to a girl whom I had feelings for my freshman year. We became closer and some of the free time I spent by myself I decided to spend with her. We are in the same classes and she has no problem studying with me, so we also spend a lot of time together that way.

One night I came home and found my roommate crying. I asked if there was anything I could do but she told me to go away. I texted her and said that if she needed to talk or vent to me about anything I would always be available and just to let me know. She never responded to this text. For nearly a week we didn't talk and anytime I saw her she completely ignored me. My thought was that it would be best to give her space if she was angry with me or going through something entirely different, as I had let her know she had my support anytime.

Eventually she texted me back and said she was sorry for not responding and being distant. I told her not to worry about it at all and if she wanted to talk about things I was absolutely available. When we talked she let me know she felt like I wasn't being a good friend. I acknowledged that I had incredibly busy, and apologized that I had made her feel that way. I suggested that we could watch GOT that weekend and grab some food as a way to make up for it. She was happy with this but when I mentioned my new relationship she immediately got mad again and told me I could do way better than the girl I am seeing (who is a friend of her friend).

Later that week, I was hanging out with gf at her house when roommate (who has my location) told me to call her.  She asked if I could bring her a sprite. I was more than a mile away and it was about midnight. I didn't feel like ditching my girlfriend just to bring my roommate a sprite. I told her to try the vending machine downstairs but that I would walk over with gf and grab a sprite if she needed me to. She declined and said we needed to speak alone.

I told her we could have a conversation and the next day when we talked, she started crying and told me I am a terrible friend and roommate and I dont make any effort or reciprocate the nice things she does for me, and she effectively told me she wasn't my friend anymore.

They are saying that that is the only time they all can play(There are 9 of them). I asked if they can just play without me, but they said I had agreed to do it weeks before (I didn‚Äôt). He also says that he‚Äôs spent a long time planning this and I will ruin it if I don‚Äôt go (I don‚Äôt understand why)?

12,1ce3sft,AITA for arguing with the lifeguard at my local pool?,"Throwaway because my friends know my usual account. I (37F) was at our local community centre pool today with my 3 children. For this post I will change their names, but they are Jane (3) Alison (5) and Henry (8).

Going to the pool is a regular outing for us. Sometimes we go with my husband but today he was at work, so I took them by myself. I got the kids ready in the family change room area, and entered the pool area. Henry is a great swimmer so I often let him watch Alison not far away from me in an area of the pool that is slightly over their heads. There are also at least 2 lifeguards watching this pool all the times. Jane prefers to stay in the shallower area of the pool, so I usually stay over there with her. 

Well today I was sitting in the shallow area with Jane as I usually do, while Alison and Henry swam a little further away in the deeper area of the pool. (This pool does not have a normal layout, it is meant for kids so it has a lazy river which is about 4 feet deep, a basketball court area which is 5 feet deep, and a baby area which is kind of like a beach).

 One of the lifeguards yelled at me to ‚Äúbe in arms reach of all my kids‚Äù. She was very rude, so I told her we swim here all the time and it has never been a problem. She told me that they were too young to swim in this section alone. I pointed out that it was a kids pool and they are good swimmers but she still said they couldn‚Äôt swim without an adult until they are 12. So I put Jane in a float and went over there with them even thought Jane was not happy about it.

Alison and Henry were playing on big floating pool toys about 5 feet away from me and I was just keeping Jane occupied, since she doesnt like being in the deeper water. 

Well Alison fell off the floaty she was playing with while I was playing with Jane, and the next thing I know the lifeguard is blowing her whistle and jumping in after Alison. She handed her to me (looking kind of pissed off). I told her she didn‚Äôt need to get in and that Alison can swim plus Henry was watching her. 

The lifeguard said ‚Äúwell she wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and then told me that if I wanted to keep swimming I had to put my children in lifejackets.

I told her that was ridiculous because my children can swim, plus she is obviously there to save them in case they need help. I left shortly after, but am I the asshole for not wanting to put them in lifejackets and expecting the lifeguards to actually do their jobs?

I made an off the cuff joke without thinking and blurted out, ""But Mom‚Äôs not  at a football match."" Almost immediately, the mood in the room shifted and everyone shared how they felt that what I said was not nice before my mom began to cry and started heading back to her room. She came back later to talk to me where she reminded me about her insecurity that she had about being told she was dumb because she was told that all her life and as a kid as well as that it hurt that it hurt that it was *her son* telling her these things. my dad came in later to tell me that it was rude because of how directed it was towards.

I have realized that I may have made a mistake in speaking before I thought and so frivolously and not recognizing/remembering my mom's insecurities.

I do think I should've chosen someone else, though I did just reach the hand om my mind into an imaginary hat and pull out a random name which happened to be hers.

TL;DR: I called my mom a dummy as a joke which hit an insecurity I didn't think of and that it hurt to hear that from her son.

14,1ce3n2t,WIBTA if I left my grandparent's anniversary early to attend a friend's exhibit?,"I (21F) graduated college early and have been living at home with my parents and grandparents before starting grad school. I have been living at home for my entire life, even during college, so I never really had a college experience, especially with the pandemic. I never really went out or partied unless it was to support a friend's accomplishment and even then, I tell my parents in advance where and who I am going with.

I have known for a couple of months that my close childhood friend would be hosting a group art exhibit. This is her first and last exhibit as a senior in college and I have been looking forward to it, knowing how hard she worked to curate it. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, I learned that my grandparents would be celebrating their anniversary with my dad's side of the family (what luck it lands on the same day as my friend's exhibit). I was never formally told (found out through my sister who was also forced to come even though she has finals). Additionally, I don't like my dad's side of the family since they always ignore me and are incredibly judgmental/competitive, especially my cousin who just started college. My baby cousins will also be coming and I know I will be stuck babysitting them the entire time, since my sister will be studying for her finals (and maybe my judgey cousin).

I am frustrated to say the least because my family never tells me anything until the last minute and expects me to drop everything at the last minute (this is not the first time this has happened; the same thing happened during my college graduation when we left before I could say goodbye to my friends). 

My plan would be to stay for lunch (since that is what my grandparents wanted) and leave afterward to attend my friend's exhibit. I thought this was a reasonable compromise, but I was immediately shut down by my parents. I do try to take into consideration their feelings, but because of that, I feel like I missed out on being young/free and hanging out with people my age, especially since I will be starting grad school soon.

TW: talk of mental illnesses

I (20f) and my mother (53f) are currently at odds sort of.

For background recently I have gotten a diagnosis for BPD(borderline personality disorder) the assessment talked about a lot of things but mainly how my childhood was, due to what was in it I didn‚Äôt want my mother to read it cuz if she did she would be extremely upset to the point that she would have a big breakdown.

So I hid it then had a talk with my mother about how I did have the diagnosis but I don‚Äôt want her reading it she seemed okay with that saying she won‚Äôt and that I could trust her.

Unfortunately didn‚Äôt go that way I had to scan the documents onto my laptop because of government funding stuff and put it in a file which you would need to basically go snooping to find which she did and read it.

I was on the couch not aware of what she was doing on my laptop when she suddenly got up saying she had to go I grabbed the laptop cuz gaming lol and saw my document open I asked my mother about it and she said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this many questions rn‚Äù and stormed to her room. 
Later you could hear crying all around the house and that‚Äôs when I knew what she did.

The next day she asked me to hug her I was unsure but went and did so, during the hug she went I‚Äôm sorry I did lie to you yesterday.

Then she started going on that some information about my childhood was wrong and how I shouldn‚Äôt say some of the stuff to the person and her saying for me to go ahead and talk to my sister about how much of a bad mother she is for reading my assessment when I asked about her saying I could trust her.

Ever since then I don‚Äôt know how to feel, our current dynamic is like nothing has changed but inside I feel a lot of turmoil and I find it hard to give her a silent treatment or anything and people are saying I should forgive her cuz she is just trying to be a better mother and she has already have a child that has cut her off but I don‚Äôt like that explanation.

So today with Mother‚Äôs Day around the corner I don‚Äôt know if I should get her anything but if I don‚Äôt get her anything my feelings would be evident even though I have been acting normal around her, so WIBTA?

We decided to have a pot luck and all bring in home made food. Pot luck day arrives and everyone is raving about this Agua Fresca that a coworker made. When it's my turn to try it I pour it out of the jug and the lid comes off and the Agua Fresca spills all over the counter, desk, myself, my shoes etc. I was shocked and I ran to clean it. After it's clean we all eat and the 24/F that made it starts questioning me for the rest of the day. 'How could you be so dumb and not know how to pour juice' 'next time you should ask' 'Thank you for ruining our pot luck and our day' 'I didn't even bring the juice for you and you had to ruin it as always' ' I  didn't even make it for you in the first place' ' I stayed up until 11 PM to make this and you ruined it' Mind you,  there is still a full jar left.

I could relate because I have two cats that help with my own anxiety. After she moved states, we stayed connected through Facebook, mainly reacting to each other's posts.

Jessica often posted her CashApp and Venmo details on Facebook, asking for money for pet food, toys, and even rent. Despite having a decent job, she seemed to manage her finances poorly, which I found odd. I usually ignored these types of posts.

The incident: One day, I saw a post about Jessica‚Äôs cat needing emergency surgery after a neighbors dog attacked her, costing about $2000. She asked facebook for financial help. I messaged her, suggesting that the dog's owner should cover the costs. She explained the owner was broke and her cat urgently needed surgery. Feeling sympathetic, I sent her $600 from my savings.

I hinted that I expected the money back if her neighbor paid. A few days later, Jessica posted that her neighbor had indeed paid the full $2000, avoiding court. I congratulated her but later asked about getting my $600 back. She seemed confused and insisted it was a donation, needed now for her cat‚Äôs recovery and other essentials.

I was shocked. I tried to clarify that my intention was to loan the money for the surgery, not give it away for other uses. She called me a horrible friend and blocked me on Facebook. As a college student, $600 is a significant amount for me.

As in, we talk/see each other maybe once or twice a year because we went to college in different states and now live in different states. Since forever we've known that we were gonna be the maid of honors in each others' weddings. 

Well her fiance (26M) proposed to her last summer and she asked me (basically told me) I was gonna be the maid of honor in her wedding this December. It was a really fun and exciting idea at the time (who doesn't want to be in a wedding?) but as time has gone on, we've been in contact more in the last few months than we have in years, because of the wedding planning, and I've realized that we're not as close as I thought we've been all this time. 

For one, she's being a bit of a bridezilla, which is fine and a bit expected, but still annoying nonetheless. In a controlling and kind of ungrateful way. Like, when people plan things on her behalf (engagement party, shower, etc) it always seems like she's unhappy with the results and acts like it, but refuses to admit it. 
I'm planning her bachelorette party and I've slowly started to realize that I don't know her quite as well as I thought I did. And I've also come to the sad thought that, maybe I don't love her enough to be her maid of honor. Which, women know, you have to really love someone to put up with the shit maid of honors deal with, like covering extra costs, putting in the extra time, effort, and just all around concern for the couple.

26,1ce1bik,"AITA for telling my mom that if she wants a servant so bad, she can either hire one, or pay me?","I (20M) still live with my mom (42F). I know it's generally seen as weird to still be an adult and living with my mom, but unfortunately, it's for money reasons. It's a lot easier to live together and contribute to the bills than find a place on my own, or with roommates. If I could, I'd have moved out a long time ago. Anyway, I'd like to start this by saying my mother is incredibly lazy. I'm not saying that in a physical sense, because she works out as much as she can. She doesn't like doing *anything* for herself. I need to bring her snacks, I need to get her water, I need to get her meds, I need to go to the store, I need to do her laundry, I need to do *everything* for her. Unless I'm not at home, considering I work full time, just like her. The minute I wake up, to the minute I go to sleep, I'm basically her personal servant. She works from home. I work during the week and have weekends off, and so does she. I clean every single day, and she cleans MAYBE on Sundays, but she only cleans her room. According to her, I'm responsible for every mess in the house (excluding her room), so it's my job to clean it, despite basically never being home. After work she reads or watches TV, after work I continue to work. I basically have to beg to have a day off to relax. 

I should mention that I do pay expenses too. I contribute $200 a month towards utilities and phone bills. She hasn't asked for more, and I'm sure as hell not offering her more. 

Being her personal servant has taken a physical toll on me. I've had a hip condition since 2020, and the work has only made it worse. All the going up and down stairs, back and forth from her room to the kitchen to the living room, etc. I legitimately get yelled at if I don't come fast enough when she summons me. She invades my room and refuses to leave if I'm too slow. She rarely cooks dinner, it's ever rarer that she'd do something for me if I asked. The only time she took care of me was after my unsuccessful hip surgery, and even then I had to quit my crutches a week early to keep up with her demands. I understand that I'm an adult, but I'm fucking exhausted. Whenever I try to bring up how unfair this is, I always get the ""I'm the mother, you're the child. Its a privilege that you still get to live here"" excuse. My final straw was a few days ago, when she yelled at me for not filling up her water before I went to bed, and she woke up thirsty. I yelled at her that if she wanted a fucking servant so badly, she could either hire one, or pay me the amount she could hire one for. She then got more pissed off, and told me if I didn't like living here, I could leave, and live in my own filth.

I decided to work, and go to school later, so I could save up money and not have to take out as many student loans.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-27,"AITA for telling my mom that if she wants a servant so bad, she can either hire one, or pay me? I (20M) still live with my mom (42F). I know it's generally seen as weird to still be an adult and living with my mom, but unfortunately, it's for money reasons. It's a lot easier to live together and contribute to the bills than find a place on my own, or with roommates. If I could, I'd have moved out a long time ago. Anyway, I'd like to start this by saying my mother is incredibly lazy. I'm not saying that in a physical sense, because she works out as much as she can. She doesn't like doing *anything* for herself. I need to bring her snacks, I need to get her water, I need to get her meds, I need to go to the store, I need to do her laundry, I need to do *everything* for her. Unless I'm not at home, considering I work full time, just like her. The minute I wake up, to the minute I go to sleep, I'm basically her personal servant. She works from home. I work during the week and have weekends off, and so does she. I clean every single day, and she cleans MAYBE on Sundays, but she only cleans her room. According to her, I'm responsible for every mess in the house (excluding her room), so it's my job to clean it, despite basically never being home. After work she reads or watches TV, after work I continue to work. I basically have to beg to have a day off to relax. 

I should mention that I do pay expenses too. I contribute $200 a month towards utilities and phone bills. She hasn't asked for more, and I'm sure as hell not offering her more. 

Being her personal servant has taken a physical toll on me. I've had a hip condition since 2020, and the work has only made it worse. All the going up and down stairs, back and forth from her room to the kitchen to the living room, etc. I legitimately get yelled at if I don't come fast enough when she summons me. She invades my room and refuses to leave if I'm too slow. She rarely cooks dinner, it's ever rarer that she'd do something for me if I asked.

So my sister is two years older than me, I was the first one to get pregnant back in 2022‚Ä¶ she was very involved in my baby shower, which I deeply did appreciate, but it‚Äôs more like she just loves to be in control.  My Mother in law was super supportive and she basically told my MIL to fuck off and said she hated the invites she made, just petty stuff like that.  She started fights with her and just kind of wanted full control but it was very ugly and stressful at the time. 

Even when I got married, she kind of started fights with my husbands father about who was going to take pictures‚Ä¶  she is very controlling and always has been. It rubs everyone the wrong way‚Ä¶.

Thank you all for the advice in the comments of my original post! I‚Äôm sorry for taking so long to post an update for you! Btw the sister is NOT pregnant! 

I spoke with my sister on Tuesday of this past week and it was not a very positive conversation. I was still extremely hurt and she was angry with me for ruining her excitement. I ended that conversation by telling her that at the end of the day, she would have to make her choice on wether they would go through with this engagement and wedding or wait until after my wedding based on what felt most right to her. She left me on read and I didn‚Äôt reach back out because I felt like the ball was in her court. 

Last night she reached out to me and apologized for hurting my feelings. She said that she doesn‚Äôt want things to be bad between us over this. She then started asking me more questions about how I felt. After some more explanation I asked her if she had talked to her boyfriend about our phone call. She said that she did and when I asked how it went she said that he told her she needed to reach out to me and try to make things right. She said it took her awhile to reach out because she was still trying to process her emotions but ultimately she knew he was right. 

I asked her what they decided to do and she said that after several days of talking it over they have decided to postpone the proposal until after my wedding in September. She said that their new plan is to get engaged soon after my wedding and plan their wedding for early 2025. They have not said anything to our family about the engagement and my family has been blissfully unaware of the state of my sister and I‚Äôs relationship. 

I guess you could say that this is the best case scenario for this situation. There is still quite a bit of tension between my sister and I but hopefully that will get better with time.

44,1cergfo,AITA For Not Wanting My Cousin's New GF to Come to Dinner,"I (27F) had my birthday last week and am still dealing with the repercussions of this decision. 

I live with my uncle, Ralph(47M). My other uncle, Peter, his wife (Tracy 45F) and my cousins (Jake 20 and Stacy) live ten minutes away from us. I wanted to have a birthday dinner, and invited the other household to meet at a restaurant in town. Tracy (the one I texted) said they would be there. 

The day after I sent the invite, Tracy texts me saying that Jake's girlfriend is going to be joining us for dinner. Not ASKING if the girlfriend could come, TELLING me she was coming. I was annoyed, but didn't want to cause issues so I said ""sounds good, I didn't know Jake had a gf?"" 

Tracy replied saying it was a new relationship and that they (my aunt, uncle and other cousin) hadn't met the new gf yet either. 

That changed my answer drastically. If I had known that no one had met her, then I would have said no, because now this dinner that was supposed to be for my 27th birthday was now going to turn into a Girlfriend Meet-and-Greet. But I can't take it back because then I would be the bad guy.

Later that day, I expressed my annoyances to Ralph. He then texts Tracy to stick up for me, telling her that I really only wanted family at dinner, that I didn't want to make a big deal about it, that I don't know he was reaching out to her (which I didn't). 

Tracy blows things out of proportion, saying that Jake already invited the GF, that the two had prior plans and instead of canceling on the gf or not coming to the dinner, he would just bring the gf. That if it was a big deal I should have said something to her, and that she will just tell Jake to go ahead with his prior plans with his gf and that only Peter and Stacy would be coming to dinner, that she (Tracy) wouldn't be coming because she ""didn't want anyone feeling uncomfortable."" (Ralph and Tracy currently have a rough relationship due to another issue.)

Ralph just let it go and said fine but next time please ask. Tracy then went on to say that when it came to her children she doesn't ask permission, that if it depends on her kid joining an event or not she gets to make that decision. She then said she was done with the conversation and to go through Paul if there was anything else. 

I talked to my mom and few friends about it, and they all agreed that Tracy was in the wrong, that she was stepping over a boundary and someone's birthday meal was NOT the appropriate time to introduce a new partner.

When I brought it up to my grandma, though, she blamed ME, saying that I should have just let the gf come, been grateful that there were a group of people to celebrate me, that I'm an adult, not 12, and despite it being a meal for my birthday it didn't have to be all about me.

I (19F) moved out today from my dorm. I lived there for the first semester, but had to move back home due to family issues, most of my stuff was left in my dorm room (I have my own room but common area and BR shared) because I wasn‚Äôt not allowed to cancel my agreement to live there. I was fine with it and left my stuff in my room and my fridge in the common area. My roommate dropped too during this and I was to get another roommate. This was all at end of fall sem. I planned to commute since I wasn‚Äôt far from school.
¬†
Beginning of this semester, I went to my dorm room to meet my roommate and tell her that I wont be there bc of family issues, but she could use the fridge. Everything was okay and she agreed. She gave me her insta cause she didn‚Äôt have a number bc she was international, we kept in touch.
¬†
Fast forward again to the end of this semester, I go to DM her to ask her when she is planning to move out. I see her insta is deactivated so I use her email and send her a email that says that I was trying to contact her over insta and wanted to see when she was gonna move out. This was at 11AM yesterday.
¬†
I waited a couple hours to see if she responded, nothing. I contact my RA to see if she can give me her number or them call her.. they try but she doesn‚Äôt answer and I don‚Äôt send another email since I figured it wasn‚Äôt working.
¬†
Today I go to my dorm and she‚Äôs not there. Food is in the fridge, common area and bathroom floors are sticky and hairy, her stuff was everywhere. Idk what to do so I pack all my stuff hoping she‚Äôll come. She doesn‚Äôt, so I asked front desk to call and email her, but didn‚Äôt hear back. I can‚Äôt wait any longer and the front desk just tells me to just put her food in her room. I do just that and leave it at the front of her door. I told my RA to tell her I tried my best to contact her. I also did not take some small things of my mine from the bathroom cause they were extremely dirty and sticky b/c I didn‚Äôt feel like causing a problem.
¬†
¬†
A few hours after I check out, I get an email from her asking why I dumped all her food on the floor and why I didn‚Äôt email her, along with photos. I said I did email and call, she said my email didn‚Äôt say I was moving out today and that I should‚Äôve sent another email, and her phone service plan was expired. I say I figured her email wasn‚Äôt working since her phone wasn‚Äôt so I didn‚Äôt try - front desk people also told me it would be no point. She said I still could‚Äôve sent another email. She also asked me if I scratched her MacBook on her desk and sent me a picture of it. I did not but I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôll try to accuse me.

Im also worried I could get charged a cleaning fee from her not cleaning the room before leaving ‚Äì even though I made it clear I was never there.

49,1ceqdkr,AITA for ignoring my ex-teammate when she said hi to me? ,"
Hi there - I‚Äôm 22F and need some advice. I play for a sports club in a local competition. 

I left my old club in not the greatest of terms 18 months ago. I was severely bullied by several girls in the team, which led me to develop bad anxiety. I have now gotten to a place where I can play with less anxiety, and joined a very friendly club with a nice team. 

Said girls from old club have started their own team, and I have not seen them since I left the club. I played their team today for the first time and things got a bit hectic. My ex-teammates were being extremely rough and playing dirty. 

During the course of the game, one of my teammates rolled their ankle and I had to quickly sub on for her. In my sport, this means taking Velcro bibs off which can be tough. Whilst my teammate was on the ground, I quickly took her bib off at her request, I had to yank it hard to get it off, it flew a bit off, and then I picked it up, and put it on me (this will be important).

As the game was re-starting, one of the said girls said hi (we‚Äôll call her Sally), but I didn‚Äôt respond. I felt like engaging with any of them during the game was only going to cause me to start conversations that would cause drama, and be distracting and anxiety inducing. So I simply chose not to engage with them except for saying good game and shake hands at the end.

Game ends and we win by 2 points. As my partner who came to watch my game was packing up his chair, Sally came up to him and said the following things:
- [insert my name] acted so childish and I want you to pass that onto her, she ripped the bib off her teammate and threw it at me. When I said hi, she just ignored me. She needs to know how inappropriate that is and walked off.
- I was so nice to [insert name] when we played together

My partner said he was not there when my teammate got injured bc he had to call first aiders. He did say in response to Sally saying she was nice to me something along the lines of ‚Äúwell you and your teammates behaviour back then certainly was childish, so I‚Äôll leave you with that.‚Äù

If you read before, I never actually threw the bib at her, my teammates were like wtf. And what is it her problem who takes off my teammates bib. If she had a problem with what I was doing then that‚Äôs fine but to talk to an innocent spectator like that crosses a line. It seems they have used one tiny thing with me ignoring them and misconstrued other things with the bib to try and paint me as a villain. 

I may be the asshole for completely refusing to engage with any of them and putting my partner into a situation like that. Family I have spoken to believe I should have just said hi to keep the peace, but I don‚Äôt think I should have to if it would cause me stress.

51,1ceq5g8,AITA for being surprised by my fianc√©e saying she wants to take a job for significantly less money?,"I (40M) and my fianc√©e (41F) just got engaged.  We had been dating for 1.5 years.

I want to start off by saying I love this woman to pieces.   When we met, everything between us felt so special and it felt meant to be.  I‚Äôve been in love before but never like this.  I felt like I met my life partner.

Around the time we met, my professional situation was precarious.  I have been a Realtor for over a decade, & with the recent market and high interest rates things have gotten increasingly difficult over the time we have been together.  I have started focusing on changing industries.

In contrast, she was at a high-paying job ($500K/yr range).  She told me then that in a short time she would be leaving that job for one that pays 1/4th of what she was making because it would be valuable experience that would make her an even more marketable professional.  She said her plan was to stay at this job for 2 years and then go back to what she was doing before.   She made the jump to that new Iower paying) job \~10 months ago.  I totally understood & really it didn‚Äôt matter to me what she was making.

After getting engaged we said we would come up with a plan for starting a life together.  We began having that convo last week but didn‚Äôt get far‚Äì she started saying the idea of having to say she‚Äôd do one thing or the other was ‚Äútoo much pressure‚Äù & it ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt all be on her.‚Äù  I backed off.

Well, a few days ago I read some articles about how we live in one of the most expensive states to raise a family in.  I freaked out & really screwed up by then forcing the issue.

She told me she was now thinking about just working part-time when she leaves her current job next year.   With her qualifications she can still clear 100K if she‚Äôs doing 30 hours a week, but now I‚Äôm really worried that if we have an income of <200K a year then we are going to be struggling.  Data supports that.  She said I shouldn‚Äôt expect her to make anything more than $130Kish so that she has options & can make the decision herself.  I kind of get it.

She then tells me that I‚Äôm entitled & I‚Äôm exploiting her.  That if I were a doctor or a lawyer this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.   That it‚Äôs my fault for not getting a degree, & if I were with anyone else I‚Äôd be stuck leaving the city‚Äì it‚Äôs just dumb luck that I met someone with the earning potential she has.  Wow, I‚Äôm taken aback & I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm hearing these things from my now-fianc√©e.  I would never say such hurtful things to her.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I am not with this woman for money.  It would all be better if I could make a bunch of money myself, but I think my earning potential is probably capped at 100K/year in a good situation.   There is a lot going on here.

54,1cepqa1,WIBTA for taking back my dog that I gave to my dad,"In 2022, I moved out of my dad‚Äôs house after moving home after college. During college I adopted a puppy and raised him for 4 years. He was honestly my best friend and brought me a lot of joy.  
  
It was very stressful living with my dad after college because he was an alcoholic. He functioned fine during the day and was his normal self but when he drank in the evenings he would get depressed and irritable. There were many nights he would cry at the dinner table while we‚Äôd be eating dinner. I felt absolutely helpless to help him. 

One night after I moved in he got so drunk that he was passing out at the kitchen table, and couldn‚Äôt walk. He broke a drinking glass on accident and I was afraid he‚Äôd hurt himself by walking in it. I had to carry him upstairs, at some points supporting all his weight. He passed out when we got to the top of the stairs and I called an ambulance because I thought it might be alcohol poisioning. That was my breaking point after many years of his alcoholism, more than 3/4ths of my life.  
  
I secured a job in another city and moved out shortly after that event and in with my friend but I couldn‚Äôt take my dog because my friend‚Äôs dogs didn‚Äôt like other dogs so I had to leave him with my dad. 

My dad asked if he could have him, and honestly I felt bad for my dad and wanted to support his recovery (he decided to join a 12-step program after I told him I was moving out) and honestly in that moment I was desperate to get away after years of worrying about my dad, that I was sad to do it, but it seemed like nothing else mattered but getting away.  
  
Two years later my dad still has my dog and has recovered. I just desperately want him back. He was such a comfort to me and made me laugh, and now I can‚Äôt look at him without getting sad. I‚Äôve told my dad multiple times and asked if I could have him back, but my dad says he‚Äôs become attached to him and he provides him company.

Ollie (my dog) now never leaves the house or backyard. We used to go hiking and to the dog park together and traveled together. He always got a lot of interaction. Now he‚Äôs pick of a nervous habit of chewing through sheets (bed sheets) due to anxiety. (I read on the internet that this is a nervous habit because of lack of stimulation). It breaks my heart.  
  
Would I be the asshole if I took my dog back anyway, despite what my dad says? I want to just take him. My dad says ""Don't be an Indian giver"" which would mean breaking a promise in his eyes, making me an asshole. It makes me feel bad to think of taking him since my dad is a senior and lives alone, but I feel like he should understand that I gave my dog to my dad because I felt desperate to support his recovery. 

Taking my dog back would make me an asshole because my dad might get lonely and I would be taking him despite his wishes since the dog is his now. 

I think I‚Äôd be the asshole because I‚Äôm taking away Ollie after he‚Äôs become attached to him.

56,1cep92c,AITA for telling the teachers that my daughter‚Äôs bully being a foster kid isn‚Äôt an excuse to be a brat?,"My (36F) daughter (11F) has a close knit group of 5 best friends with whom she does everything together. At her school students have to sit in the same seat for every single lesson, and my daughter and her best friends all sit together at one table.

There is another little girl in my daughter‚Äôs class called Winny. Once, Winny came to sit at my daughter‚Äôs table when one of her friends was off sick. That day, Winny constantly knocked my daughter‚Äôs books and pens off the table on accident, and borrowed her stationery only to snap one of her rubbers, stain her highlighter with black ink, and was even found with my daughter‚Äôs pens in her pocket.

One morning Winny came to school crying non stop. The teacher was very sympathetic and asked if there was anything she could do to help. Winny said she wanted my daughter removed from her seat so she could have it, and the teacher agreed. The only empty seats left were all the way in the back corner of the classroom opposite her friends, and the only students sitting there were a girl who was known to be a delinquent and two older boys who had been held back.

The teacher refused to give my daughter a real explanation for why she had to move seats, instead saying some generic stuff about being kind to those less fortunate. My daughter cried for a week straight. In our country, the school year ends in December, so that‚Äôs over 7 months of being isolated from her closest friends. She‚Äôs also starting highschool next year and will be attending a private school, while her friends are going to a public school, so this is the last time she can hang out with them everyday.

A few days ago, I was called into school because my daughter had gotten into an argument with Winny. Winny had confided in my daughter‚Äôs friends about how she had gone into foster care after her parents overdosed. Winny was always a loner at school and wanted some girls to sit with during this time, and the teacher sympathised with her so she agreed. The only reason my daughter had to move was because there wasn‚Äôt enough space for 7 girls and my daughter was simply the one Winny liked the least, and she admitted to lying to the teacher about being uncomfortable around my daughter to get her moved. When my daughter found this out, she told Winny she didn‚Äôt understand why she had to pay the price just because Winny‚Äôs parents were a bunch of insane criminals who didn‚Äôt want her anymore.

I know Winny‚Äôs had a hard time, but so has my daughter. Her older brother passed away only months ago. I told the teachers that Winny isn‚Äôt the only child going through a tough time and I didn‚Äôt understand why my daughter had to be punished for another girl‚Äôs struggles as if she wasn‚Äôt suffering herself. The teachers wanted me to make my daughter apologise for her remarks, and I said it was their fault for punishing her and forcing her to sit with the problem kids despite doing nothing wrong, and they were downplaying my daughter‚Äôs grief and trauma to cater to a brat.

My (36F) daughter (11F) has a close knit group of 5 best friends with whom she does everything together. At her school students have to sit in the same seat for every single lesson, and my daughter and her best friends all sit together at one table.

There is another little girl in my daughter‚Äôs class called Winny. Once, Winny came to sit at my daughter‚Äôs table when one of her friends was off sick. That day, Winny constantly knocked my daughter‚Äôs books and pens off the table on accident, and borrowed her stationery only to snap one of her rubbers, stain her highlighter with black ink, and was even found with my daughter‚Äôs pens in her pocket.

One morning Winny came to school crying non stop. The teacher was very sympathetic and asked if there was anything she could do to help. Winny said she wanted my daughter removed from her seat so she could have it, and the teacher agreed. The only empty seats left were all the way in the back corner of the classroom opposite her friends, and the only students sitting there were a girl who was known to be a delinquent and two older boys who had been held back.

The teacher refused to give my daughter a real explanation for why she had to move seats, instead saying some generic stuff about being kind to those less fortunate. My daughter cried for a week straight. In our country, the school year ends in December, so that‚Äôs over 7 months of being isolated from her closest friends. She‚Äôs also starting highschool next year and will be attending a private school, while her friends are going to a public school, so this is the last time she can hang out with them everyday.

A few days ago, I was called into school because my daughter had gotten into an argument with Winny. Winny had confided in my daughter‚Äôs friends about how she had gone into foster care after her parents overdosed. Winny was always a loner at school and wanted some girls to sit with during this time, and the teacher sympathised with her so she agreed. The only reason my daughter had to move was because there wasn‚Äôt enough space for 7 girls and my daughter was simply the one Winny liked the least, and she admitted to lying to the teacher about being uncomfortable around my daughter to get her moved. When my daughter found this out, she told Winny she didn‚Äôt understand why she had to pay the price just because Winny‚Äôs parents were a bunch of insane criminals who didn‚Äôt want her anymore.

I know Winny‚Äôs had a hard time, but so has my daughter. Her older brother passed away only months ago. I told the teachers that Winny isn‚Äôt the only child going through a tough time and I didn‚Äôt understand why my daughter had to be punished for another girl‚Äôs struggles as if she wasn‚Äôt suffering herself. The teachers wanted me to make my daughter apologise for her remarks, and I said it was their fault for punishing her and forcing her to sit with the problem kids despite doing nothing wrong, and they were downplaying my daughter‚Äôs grief and trauma to cater to a brat.

58,1ceomt6,WIBTA if I confronted my aunt for stressing out my mom?,"My (25yo F) mom (47yo F) is getting married in a few months and she‚Äôs trying plan it mostly by herself cause wedding planners are to expensive. Recently my mom had asked me to take her save the date picture which I happily agreed to. We did the mini shoot which was stressful in itself and she posted the save the date to her social media.

The issue starts with my aunt (50 something yo F) asking my mom why she‚Äôs being left out of the wedding planning and blaming my stepdad (48yo M) for trying to keep her out of all the decisions or whatever. Which is not true cause my mom has gone to her to talk about what she wants for the wedding and her opinion on decoration ideas and the guest list. She started saying that my stepdad is a blocker and that I might also be blocking her from being involved due to an argument my grandma and I had which was also about how they had issues with my stepdad but that whole other story. She just goes on and on about how my mom is excluding her and it‚Äôs my stepdads fault and how she think he hates her cause she owe his a couple grand that she borrowed from him and that he called her the b word on a phone call with me that I have no recollection of. My mom already stood up for herself by telling my aunt that she‚Äôs delusional and no one has an issue with her or said anything that she thinks.

I just feel bad for my mom and I‚Äôm protective of her so when some gives her issues I feel the need to shield her. It may be too much but my aunt started involving me by saying I‚Äôm trying to block her from being involved and it‚Äôs pretty annoying. Would it make me an AH for confronting her?

My stepdad invited my aunt to dinner to let her express herself to him directly about how she feels and she straight up rejected the invite by saying she‚Äôs busy.

 I asked if something emergency had happened, she said no, just routine and I asked why she didn't just let me know and I would take care of it. Her response was that now she has her own dentist and went through him, since our kid was with her and would be more easy.

She kind of snapped me and said she expected payment from me. 

I replied that I would see because I don't refuse to pay anything for Matt, especially for health reasons, but a stupid expense like that doesn't make sense and she can afford it, if she simply prefers to pay for something that I do for free.

65,1cemhq7,AITA for not wanting my roommate to adopt a potentially wild dog into the home? ,"So I live with 4 other people in a house, each with our own room. A week ago, one roommate (I'll call her patty) called and asked me if I could watch a dog that was found on the street for a day, before it got back to its owner which would presumably be found. 

It turned into about 5 days, with me picking up some of the responsibilities of caring for the dog while she's been at work for the day, and often times the dog is barking all morning long- really screwing with my sleep.

It turned into about 5 days, with me picking up some of the responsibilities of caring for the dog while she's been at work for the day, and often times the dog is barking all morning long- really screwing with my sleep.

66,1cemhib,AITA for wanting to move to another country and separate from parents?,"So, I (F20) am currently living with my mother. Honestly, I don't like the conditions we are living in at all (not anyone's fault, we are ukrainian refugees), and I really feel that I need to separate from parents to live an autonomous life and take care of myself alone. I have two really close friends in another country and they offered me help with the moving and settling there. I don't have any friends or social life here tho. Also I should say that the country I am going to move to is better for me in different ways, but the most important two are friends and language (it's English there and English for me is the foreign language I know best)

I have been planning to move for almost a year now (since last summer), but my mother really didn't want to let me go and she made out like a hundred reasons for me not to go anywhere. And me, being a good daughter all my life and listening to my mother all the time, did as she said and didn't go anywhere. 

After a while I really regretted that I had stayed as I had really good opportunity to relocate which I don't have now. Nevertheless recently I made a decision that I will move regardless what my mother says because it's my life and I want to build it as I want it and not how other people tell me to live even if it's my own mother. I even have the date already, it's the end of May.

When I told her that I am going to another country she was really angry at me and told me that I am an ungrateful and egoistic daughter. She even doesn't want to talk to me anymore and that's really painful. 

I will move anyway but I am just curious if I am making the right decision or am I really an asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-27,"AITA for wanting to move to another country and separate from parents?

I'm also a really good test taker. 2 years ago, in 9th grade, I took the pre ACT and got a 25. Already an amazing score. Now I'm in 11th grade and just got my scores back today. 29 composite. 35 in science. 8 on my writing.

Safe to say, my family was extremely excited. We called my grandma and aunt to tell them the news. While I was talking, my sister kept butting in, saying how I got my brains from her. Weird, but I tried to ignore it.

Well, once I had gotten off the phone and was talking to our mom, I look down to see my sister hiding in her blanket. When I jokingly asked if she was okay in there, she started sobbing, saying how she's worried she'll get a worse score than me, which is likely, given that a 29 is extremely high. She gets really anxious about tests. But, at the same time, she's only in 8th grade.

She's done this kind of thing in the past. Crying when I got a birthday present she wanted, crying when I had friends over, basically crying whenever I got something that she wanted. Well, we're planning to celebrate my score, but I don't know if I want my sister there. I don't want her to take away from my moment.

She goes over to our father's house every other week, so it wouldn't be in her face that we were celebrating without her.

70,1cem521,AITA for being a terrible daughter in law and fiancee?,"I (27F) have been with my fiancee (31M) for 8 years now. 



Background: This started when I first met her at my fiancee's (then bf) convocation. She flew here to see his ceremony as he studied abroad. It was all going well until the day of the ceremony. We were running late. My mom and sister were coming to show support and we had difficulties finding 4 seats together near the front. That is when my MIL suggested that she sit at the front in a single seat and we can all find a seat in the back together. I was very upset and this turned into a big fight between my fiancee and I. After that, I was low contact with my IL's.



Context: I have always struggled with my weight. I have health issues that has caused significant fluctuation in my weight. My MIL would make comments, whenever she sees me, about losing weight. My fiancee said it is from a place of concern. Besides those remarks, we rarely spoke. The rest of his family were kind to me and we were rarely ever in contact beyond the odd check in's. She would also reach out to me when she could not get a hold of her son but not much beyond that.



Last year, we purchased our first home together with financial help from my parents. My IL did not offer any assistance with that, nor did I want them to. It is a small 2 bedroom home. Half a year later, my SIL (40f) said she wanted to move to a new country with her child (10f) and come live with us. She told my fiancee that she waited for us to buy a house first before moving. I was not asked for my thoughts as from their culture, we were expected to help. Having them live with us was a nightmare. I cleaned up after them while also teaching them about how to live here. When they first moved here, they facetimed my MIL. My MIL saw my body for the first time as I had avoided video calls due to comments about weight. The first words from my MIL was oh wow, you have gained a lot of weight. I laughed it off and went to my room to cry. After that, my feelings towards my IL soured. SIL and niece were not good house guests. They rarely cleaned or help out with the house. They originally contributed to groceries but stopped soon after. They did not pay rent or help financially. 



Recently, SIL and child finally moved out. They left after 6 months since the relationship got very bad at the end. I have not emotionally recovered from their stay and my face sours every time my fiancee mentions his family. This caused a huge argument as recently as his sister asked for help with things for her new place.

72,1celtrh,AITA didn‚Äôt tell mum about my wedding,"Throwaway for privacy.

I (22F) got married to Matt (22M) last weekend. We met in university, same course, and we‚Äôve been inseparable ever since. He‚Äôs my best friend and the best partner one could ask for. We both live with my parents or rather they live with us since my dad got an opportunity for work in our city and they have not been able to rent somewhere yet. Matt‚Äôs family are quite well off so bought him a big 3 bed flat in our city when he started university which I moved into when we got serious and now my parents moved into the spare room which we used as a workout space. 

When I was a kid, my parents seemed largely disinterested in me. Over time, I stopped telling them about my life hoping they‚Äôd become invested as I grew up but it never really happened and our relationship was what it was.

When it came to the wedding weekend, we invited our friends and my older siblings (I have 2 older sisters) and Matt‚Äôs family. I‚Äôm very close to them, basically a daughter they never had.

I (22F) got married to Matt (22M) last weekend. We met in university, same course, and we‚Äôve been inseparable ever since. He‚Äôs my best friend and the best partner one could ask for. We both live with my parents or rather they live with us since my dad got an opportunity for work in our city and they have not been able to rent somewhere yet. Matt‚Äôs family are quite well off so bought him a big 3 bed flat in our city when he started university which I moved into when we got serious and now my parents moved into the spare room which we used as a workout space. 

When I was a kid, my parents seemed largely disinterested in me. Over time, I stopped telling them about my life hoping they‚Äôd become invested as I grew up but it never really happened and our relationship was what it was.

73,1celt1s,AITA For wanting my fianc√© to drink less caffeine?,"Lately I have been concerned about the amount of caffeine my fianc√© consumes. While he doesn't do this every single day, there are multiple days of the week where he is consuming a LOT of caffeine (like more than the general daily recommendation 400-600mg). There are days he will start with a cup of pour over coffee or two, then get a coffee from a coffee shop while at work. He always orders the largest size they have with an extra shot. That's his default, regardless of how much other coffee he's had that day. While less common I've also seen him pound two energy drinks like Prime back to back (also after having pour over or some other coffee that morning, even a large extra shot latte). I do believe he has a higher caffeine tolerance...he's 6'4 but not super heavy set. However...

The real kicker is he just had a cousin who was relatively healthy and young (like 35) just die randomly from heart failure. So there is definitely some concern if heart issues run in the family or not. The other part I find frustrating is I feel like he just can't be bothered on this topic. Like I've told him I'd feel a lot better if he just got large coffees without the extra shot, or multiple energy drinks like just not being excessive about it. 

He seems unwilling to compromise. He feels that it's not an issue at all and needs overwhelming evidence that's it's risky and has been finding any medical journals he can that prove ""it's not that risky or not enough evidence to show"". While most basic evidence shows it's just healthier to stick to 400-600mg a day. 

I feel like he's being really stubborn by just not addressing my concerns. He's almost 40 and 10 years older than me. We're talking of having kids in the future I don't like his unwillingness to validate my concerns more than anything. I want him to be healthy and live a long time. Am I being the a\*\*hole by asking for him to reduce his caffeine content a little? Thanks in advance. ",Asshole,2024-04-27,"AITA For wanting my fianc√© to drink less caffeine?

74,1celmna,WIBTA for asking my partner to confront my ex-best friend? ,"Best Friend Suddenly Ices Me Out, Partner Still Talks to Her

During COVID walks with our dogs, I (29M) became close with Stephanie (40M), who eventually became my best friend. We even moved to neighboring streets! Over the summer, things seemed to change. We barely saw each other, and text conversations became scarce. We mainly communicated through TikTok and Instagram, where she'd send multiple messages/videos daily.

By the holidays, the distance was clear. I reached out more often via text, but responses were minimal. It felt weird considering her constant social media activity. Despite this, I dropped off flowers for Christmas and sent flowers her birthday (February), receiving polite thanks each time.

In March, things got stranger. My ""what's wrong?"" text went unanswered, and my call went to voicemail. Since then, Stephanie's completely stopped communicating with me. Here's the confusing part: my partner (39M) still texts her, maybe even met up in March.

I told him I'm hurt and confused. It's even more concerning because Stephanie has a history of mental health issues and is on medication for depression and anxiety. . While I'm definitely hurt by how things are, I'm also genuinely worried about her well-being. Initially, worried about Stephanie, I discouraged him from stopping contact.

But this week, things escalated. Stephanie blocked me on Instagram. My partner asked her directly about it to which she replied. ""Yup. If he wants to see it he can look at on yours"". I didn't see the conversation for myself- this is what I was told.

We had a long conversation about it. I'd prefer him to stop talking to her altogether, but he feels obligated to watch her dogs in July (when she visits family). He's worried her mental health will further deteriorate if he refuses. I suggested reaching out to her parents for help, but he disagreed.

Honestly, I can't shake the feeling Stephanie is still communicating with him to cause trouble between us.

75,1celkv5,AITA for following my contract and doing my new apprtment's inventory ?,"I just saw I missed up my title. I meant apartment



Hello , I (18F) am a first year student. Recently I moved to a new apartement in order to live closer to my campus. This story is between me , my mother , and the couple of landlords.

Yesterday , I moved to the new apartment , my mother was with me because I needed help moving all my stuff. We noticed that my apartment had some issue and was pretty dirty so we decided to take some photos and to write this stuff down.

Because it was written in the contract that we needed to do an inventory (which had to signal any damage or abnormalities found in the apartment) , me and my mom did exactly that. We wrote an inventory. Inside , we told the landlords the abnormalities we found (Such as broken smoke detectors , no/ripped curtains , tartar in the shower and toilets , damaged walls , stained sofa..). While this inventory was taking notice of many damages , it was not a critic in any way. It's just the procedure (And it ensure that I'm not getting in troubles for damages that I didn't caused). Actually , despite its issues I'm pretty happy to be living in this place

When the landlords got the email with the inventory , they took it very personally and were basically very mad. The lady called my mom and was being pretty aggressive toward her about our ""list of complains"". Her husband wrote me a salty email saying that the apartment was just old , that they never had any problem before and that I was more than welcome to leave and find a better apartment if I was not happy.

The thing is that my mother and I never had the intention to hurt their precious feelings. We just did as we were told on the contract and made an inventory. It's not our fault the apartment had issues (And it wouldn't have made sens to overlook these issues in a paper made to take notice of those issues)

Now the landlord (husband) wants to see me for some reasons. He does not seem very happy with me.

 I brought it up to my parents and my older brother of all people, came out, examined the tire & said I can't drive the car. When I heard this at first I thought I could get a tire replaced by taking the tire off and getting the tire replaced, so I started to jack the car up. He came back out and said I shouldn't jack the car up and instead leave the tire attached until Monday, I understand why, but I'm livid and after him try to to talk to me, I told him I don't want to talk, and don't talk to me. 

He started to talk and so I got more loud and told him don't talk to me again. He Continued and I got in my car to attempt to distract myself and again he says don't cmdrice the car. So I ignored him because I'm pissed. So, I want to know. Am i the asshole?

They also refuse to let us lock our front and back doors. 

One night my husband and I had a talk about it and looking at our bills, they almost DOUBLED in about 3 months. So we kindly asked her to pay 300 a month for rent. !WOW!

I have an older brother (41M), yes there's a significant age gap between us. I recently found out my brother knows one of my professors as they worked together and they remain good friends. A few weeks ago, I had a really bad day at college and it led me to breaking down before the end of the day. This resulted in me being referred to the mental health team. My brother called me and told me he knew about my breakdown in college and wanted to make sure I was alright. I know he comes from a caring side but I was really pissed off, I feel my privacy was violated. This breakdown happened in my professors office whose a good friend of my brothers, only she witnessed it. I don't know if I need to say this or not but my parents are listed as my next of kin and not my brother, I would have understood if she went to my parents about this. I contacted my parents to see if college contacted them, they said no but they heard about my breakdown as my brother called them and told them.

  
This professor is a professor I looked up to and admired, I could go to her about anything, I could talk to her about anything and I always felt safe and respected around her. All of that is now gone. I trusted her and I felt she has violated my trust and privacy. Again, I know my brother, parents and professors are concerned about me and my mental health, however, as my brother isn't my NOK if she needed to contact anyone she should contact my parents as they're my NOK. I found out my brother knew because they met up outside of her work hours and she spoke about me to my brother. This has led me to filing a complaint against the professor and I only recently submitted the complaint, they just started the formal process for dealing with the complaints. The professor is a well-liked professor, she's good at her job and I won't deny that, but it's led to students ganging up on me, calling me all sorts of names and berating me for doing it. Even some professors seem to be treating me differently.

Was I in the wrong regarding making a complaint which could lead me to being a complete asshole?

I have an older brother (41M), yes there's a significant age gap between us. I recently found out my brother knows one of my professors as they worked together and they remain good friends. A few weeks ago, I had a really bad day at college and it led me to breaking down before the end of the day. This resulted in me being referred to the mental health team. My brother called me and told me he knew about my breakdown in college and wanted to make sure I was alright. I know he comes from a caring side but I was really pissed off, I feel my privacy was violated. This breakdown happened in my professors office whose a good friend of my brothers, only she witnessed it. I don't know if I need to say this or not but my parents are listed as my next of kin and not my brother, I would have understood if she went to my parents about this. I contacted my parents to see if college contacted them, they said no but they heard about my breakdown as my brother called them and told them.

  
This professor is a professor I looked up to and admired, I could go to her about anything, I could talk to her about anything and I always felt safe and respected around her. All of that is now gone. I trusted her and I felt she has violated my trust and privacy. Again, I know my brother, parents and professors are concerned about me and my mental health, however, as my brother isn't my NOK if she needed to contact anyone she should contact my parents as they're my NOK. I found out my brother knew because they met up outside of her work hours and she spoke about me to my brother. This has led me to filing a complaint against the professor and I only recently submitted the complaint, they just started the formal process for dealing with the complaints. The professor is a well-liked professor, she's good at her job and I won't deny that, but it's led to students ganging up on me, calling me all sorts of names and berating me for doing it. Even some professors seem to be treating me differently.

Was I in the wrong regarding making a complaint which could lead me to being a complete asshole?

80,1cektp3,WIBTA for telling my friend if she doesn't change her behavior we would no longer be friends?,"I (24 f) have a friend, let's call her Nat (24 f). We've met in high school by our mutual friend and remained friends to this day. There was a time when we were inseparable, we would do everything together, we were going to parties, having a weekly meeting just to gossip etc. Things changed a bit when we went to college. 

  
Since highschool I've lost 20kg, grew my hair out (naturally ginger), started wearing make up more frequently. I‚Äôve also signed up for several photo sessions to build up my self-esteem which was pretty low due to previous bullying. Nat was very happy for me and supportive at first, until I've started going on dates. She always keeps complaining about how she was single her whole life and never been to a date so I started to encourage her to go out, and meet someone. Well....this didn't end well. One of her friends friend asked her out politely and she just blocked him! I was angry at her because what she did was rude and totally immature. When I confronted her about that she just stopped responding for my messages for several days and then just texted me ""omg I'm sorry it took me so long"" (we're texting each other every single day).   
About 2 years ago I've met her best friend from college, Mandy (24 f). She's really great girl and we get along pretty well. Nat was really happy about that. The 3 of us have a group chat where we write random things, send memes etc. Sometimes we're discussing some more serious topics like dating. Mandy has a dating app and started to go on dates and I'm really happy for her. Nat on the other hand is not happy at all because in her opinion dating apps are crap. Mandy's really trying everything just to find a man of her dreams and it's good to be cautious but Nat could at least show a little bit of support. 

  
Nat pretty much started copying me about 3 months ago: started dressing up like me, bought the same clothes. I‚Äôve started talking about getting another piercing and all of the sudden she also wants it. I‚Äôve decided to get a tattoo and guess what? Nat‚Äôs also getting a tattoo! And to top all of that she‚Äôs really mean to me lately and made some hurtful comments and I have no idea why. About a week ago she had send us link to a concert and asked if we want to go with her. I told her many times that I have a lot of expenses lately and she said she respects that. Also me and Mady are working and studying, Nat doesn‚Äôt work and her parents pay for her every whim.  
Yesterday, when she threw a temper tantrum because I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money just to go with her to the concert of a band I don‚Äôt like, I‚Äôve had enough. I told her that she‚Äôs acting like a child and she needs to stop or else I‚Äôll just cut her out of my life. Maybe I overreacted but I‚Äôm just tired of putting up with her shit. She's not treating people well and when I try to tell her that her behavior is inappropriate, she gets offended.

My boyfriend's mom and I were keen on building a friendship with her, so we extended invitations to dinners and outings.

Cut to Joe's wedding, where the stress of planning probably to got the best of Sarah, resulting in a major fallout between her and my boyfriend's mom.

83,1cekcgo,AITA for not appreciating camping gear as a graduation gift?,"For context, I have always hated camping. Since I was a child this was a well documented fact and routinely the butt of family jokes. On the other hand, my mother loves to go camping/hiking/backpacking and has trips planned almost every other weekend until September. 

She‚Äôs recently expressed that she wants camping to be something that we do together after I graduate from college in a week or so. Last summer, we went on a camping trip with extended family in which I borrowed a sleeping bag and mentioned that it was comfy. When asked if I would want one in case of future trips, I said that I by no means needed one but would be happy to have one if it went on sale or something to that effect.

What started as a sleeping bag has now become that, a blow-up mattress, a tent, a backpack including poop shovels, and various other things. Not only do I have now a bunch of camping gear but more recently I have received the news that this gear is in fact my graduation gift. 

I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt appreciate the sentiment nor that I don‚Äôt acknowledge the money that went in to getting those things, but every time my mother brings it up I can‚Äôt help but wish she had thought of something else. Not only does she know I don‚Äôt care for camping but as my mother who I am close with I feel overlooked and misjudged on the things I actually like. I‚Äôm graduating from film school and have always especially adored photography. When I was asked a while back if I had any ideas for graduation gifts, my first answer was a camera as I have never had one of my own. This is the only thing that I have consistently wanted (and expressed wanting) for several years.

Now my best friend has mentioned that their parents, who historically don‚Äôt gift well at all and aren‚Äôt the greatest in general, are giving her the camera which I have wanted for years. My mother knows this, and when I heard I expressed doubly that I would love to have something along those lines. I am the first in my family to have achieved a degree, and while I wasn‚Äôt even expecting any graduation gift in the first place, I do feel like the one that I‚Äôm being given is not one that is really for me - rather, it is something which my mom got for me so that she could guilt me into staying at home longer in order to camp with her as opposed to moving away for work. 

Even then, those camping trips that I mentioned? The ones that she has planned through the next year? I‚Äôm not going on any of them. Instead, my mom has decided that I have PROMISED her (never did anything of the sort) that I will stay home for the year so that I can watch the house and pets while she goes off and does her soul searching. I‚Äôve been told that to get a job and move away before they are done is inconveniencing her and causing her stress, so if I want to stay in her good graces I need to be her house sitter and wait to actually get a job until it‚Äôs convenient for her.

Jack and Jen has always had a turbulent relationship.

They have had breaks on several occasions and I will not lie Jen is always the instigator. I also won‚Äôt lie and say that Jack is a flawed man and Jen had point in not being satisfied with him. Anyway the last time she asked for a break, Jack met Amy. This time Jack didn‚Äôt want to go back to Jen. Jen became distraught and devastated. It was devastating to everyone because we all were friends. 

Now my wife and Jen call Amy the siren. I think it is unfair. First because amy is a great person. Second because I have never seen Jack this happy and third because I believe Jack is family and we should welcome his soon to be wife into our midst. I think calling her a siren is cruel and disrespectful not only to her but to Jack as well implying that he was dumb enough to be hoodwinked.

**Update** 

Yeah so I have told my wife that the internet sided with me. Thank you guys. It backfired on me tho because my wife was so angry with me! Wife said that she is team Jen and will always be team Jen. And that she will do EVERYTHING IN HER POWER (yelling) to break things between Jack and Amy. 

I told her that I was team Jack because I value family and no matter the past, Jack is a better person now. A happier person too but that I understand that a 20 year friendship is strong. I advised her however not to do anything sinister to break a loving relationship because karma would bite her in the ass. And that if she really loved Jen, she should help her move on to a relationship she can actually be happy in since she wasn‚Äôt happy with Jack. My wife got VERY Angry and told me that I didn‚Äôt get to decide when Jen was happy or not. That I never liked Jen. I didn‚Äôt deny it but I told her that me liking or disliking her has more to do with our personalities not vibing and I still wnt her to be happy because she isn‚Äôt a bad person. I told her that I will be having Jack‚Äôs back.

I called Jack in front of her and told him everything. Turns out he already knew about the bullying and he said that they(Jack and Amy) basically don‚Äôt care. I told Jack about my wife‚Äôs threats about breaking him and Amy up. He laughed and said bring it on but that I should warn her that if she wanted to be a part of his family not to do stupid shit.

Then Jack ended the conversation with a message to my wife, that when Jen is done using her and dropped her like a hot potato. She is welcome to commiserate with him about it.

He understands that Amy will never be a close friend but that she should be treated as a sister in law. Not many sisters in law are friends.

Then Jack ended the conversation with a message to my wife, that when Jen is done using her and dropped her like a hot potato. She is welcome to commiserate with him about it.

86,1cekc2t,AITA Arguing with my BF for saying thank you?,"So my boyfriend (m26) and I (f26) have a rule. Three nights out of the week he cooks and I do dishes, three nights it‚Äôs the other way around, and one night we do takeout or date night. This morning I made breakfast and did the dishes I ignored from the meal he cooked the night before. He said ‚Äúthanks for doing the dishes‚Äù like he always does and I came to the realization that I hate it when he says thank you for tasks that we should both contribute to to make the house operate. 

I‚Äôm a firm believer of splitting tasks and sharing the workload of the home, we both work full time, no kids. Keeping it equal is important to us. I deep clean, he does laundry, we share cooking and dishes, he vacuums one week, I vacuum the next. It‚Äôs not militant, we will miss a day or pick up the others slack if they had a bad day/ week and there‚Äôs never drama if we get behind, we both just have a hyper cleaning Sunday.

Anyways I kinda snapped and explained to him that I might have pathological demand avoidance or something, but whenever he says thank you (literally every time I do a common task) and I‚Äôm doing something essential to the functioning of the house, the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is almost meaningless to me. If I‚Äôm doing something that is a basic task that helps our home stay clean and function well I don‚Äôt want to be thanked. His actions of taking on other chores or doing the dishes when I cook far outweigh the daily ‚Äúthank you‚Äôs‚Äù and it almost makes ‚Äúthank you‚Äù over used. Then it starts to annoy me. 

He says it‚Äôs his automatic reaction to say thank you, it‚Äôs just polite. I love him and he is so sweet! BUT
 
I say thank you to him for everything he does because he likes words of affirmation, but to me if he says thank you for every chore I do, it annoys me / makes ‚Äúthank you‚Äù lose meaning and starts to feel ingenuine. I tried to explain this and he thinks I‚Äôm crazy and told me to post here so do your worst. I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole especially towards him. 

TLDR: I snapped at my boyfriend because he says thank you when I do chores that are essential to the house running. Five thank you‚Äôs a day for simple tasks make the term thank you feel ingenuine.

I scheduled an appointment to get a tattoo I got 10+ years ago added on to(that I somewhat hate bc it's so basic). I paid a 150 deposit. I scheduled this appointment two years ago. I was supposed to get it done one year ago and had to reschedule when I had some financial problems(car accident during last semester of graduate school!). This is a well known artist who books a year out.

On Friday I had something very similar happen with my friend group falling apart. I am very sad about it and my girlfriend has noticed the similarities with both situations. She has also noticed I have been very sad about this as a result and she has been trying to cheer me up.

My girlfriend has been pushing me to talk with another friend from my friend group but I really don't want to talk about this right now and I am not ready to address it.

So for the whole evening she was pushing me to either talk about my feelings or pushing me to talk with my friend about the situation and each time I told her I didn't want to.

This morning I felt pretty much the same and my girlfriend has continuously asked me talk about it or call my friend. I told her that I appreciated that she wanted to help but that what she was doing was actually bothering me and I once again reiterated that I didn't want to talk about it.

This past week my S/O's brother M(39) was released from jail & is now living at my son's grandparents home. He'd been incarcerated for almost 3 yrs so he's never met his nephew (my son).

I know he's used sparingly throughout his time in jail, but their parents (my son's grandparents) do not know this. 
The grandparents wanted to pick up my son for the weekend & I told my S/O no effin' way. He wasn't going to stay there without me or his father being present the entire time. When I told my S/o this he said that's fine, but HE would be the one to tell them that he wanted to wait until we could all come & for me not to say a word. He said he will make up a reason why. 
I don't understand why this is such an issue & why we can't be upfront. & Also why I am vilified anytime I have legitimate concerns? I will not let my son go with his father alone anymore either since he hasn't shown any sign of stopping, but they haven't heard me say this outright.

The first seizure I had me and Kate spoke about it and she was quite supportive. Doctors originally told me it was a one off and probably won‚Äôt happen again. 

The very first seizure I had was on the Tuesday. We were due to go to bottomless brunch/a night out on the Saturday. Because I had hit my head and had a pretty severe concussion I was advised not to drink alcohol for at least a month. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to go but we could maybe go for lunch somewhere instead. She was moody with me for not wanting to go, so we just left it and I then saw on Instagram, she went on a night out with someone else. 

After about a month I realised that she hadn‚Äôt once asked me how I was, if I needed anything or came to see me. I was very conscious at the time that I didn‚Äôt want to seem as if I was complaining about being ill and be depressing to talk to, so would try and keep it to a minimum but would tell her if I was back in hospital and ask how she was. 

After about a month I realised she hadn‚Äôt replied to a few messages and didn‚Äôt seem to really care. I‚Äôll admit that at the time I was very depressed so maybe I should have made more effort? I just stopped making as much of an effort and she never messaged me again. To me it seemed like because I couldn‚Äôt go out every weekend and be fun anymore she didn‚Äôt really want to know.

Summer last year I decided to just delete her off everything. The main reason was because it made me feel shit everytime I saw her going out because I still missed her and missed being able to do that sort of stuff. Also what was the point if we weren‚Äôt friends (I tend to keep social media very private).

A few days ago she requested to follow me on instagram. I messaged her asking how she was. I then said I was surprised she had followed me. She just said ‚Äúwell you stopped following me on everything‚Äù. I explained why I had that and she said the reason she didn‚Äôt reach out was because she was having a really hard time and was ‚Äòmentally fucked‚Äô.

She said the reason she was having a difficult time and why she was going out constantly was because people were complaining she wasn‚Äôt as fun anymore and wasn‚Äôt partying as much?

She said she tried to reach out but couldn‚Äôt because I had blocked her number. Which I never did. I changed my number in Feb 22 but still had her on WhatsApp and everything else.

However I have done this exact same thing beforehand to them. It was a CS project where we had to fix up issues in codes (C++) and write clear and definitive reasons about those changes and how it fixes the mistakes. 

I did this back in January, I have a severe common cold problem, If I catch it, It wont go away for like half the year, and especially since it was winter in December/January, my cold was worsening. I then made dumb decisions to eat more cold food like Ice creams and what not. Then by January my condition worsened, In class I was put into that specific group even though I tried to explain to our teacher that I was in no condition of helping them. I did this by calling him, in my house. I wasn't even present in the school and wasnt for a week beforehand. Since this was a project that needed to be done in school, and the fact I couldn't attend for the entirety and after this group project, I was labeled as a betrayer by the other people in the group. I did get credits for my supposed ""part"" in the project even though I NEVER asked for it. 

Fast forward to March we all get the same groups yet again for another CS project, A documentation on various methods of defence against cyber crimes. Now this chapter about Cyber security is the largest chapter, it's like the length of FOUR different ones all put together. Even then I decided to repay them and offered to do about 50% of the work and the other 5 people would split about 10%.

But just last week, They all sent me over their ""part"" of the project together, all of which containing practically nothing but a fuck you text sideways. This confused me and I reached out to them. But in the group chat all of them flamed me for abandoning them the last time and how they expected as a Computer nerd I would do majority of the work even though I was sick. 

This pissed me off and I decided to fuck them over. The submit dates are on the 30th, I sent them the link to the google drive file but cut off access unless approval and rejected each of them several times. Then they started a group voice call to berate me about being a bad friend and to learn to take jokes. 

I had to do ALL the work myself, 50% of which IN THE PAST 3 DAYS SPENDING AROUND 8 HOURS for this. But when I talked to a mutual, they thought I went too far. So AITA?

I then made dumb decisions to eat more cold food like Ice creams and what not. Then by January my condition worsened, In class I was put into that specific group even though I tried to explain to our teacher that I was in no condition of helping them. I did this by calling him, in my house. I wasn't even present in the school and wasnt for a week beforehand. Since this was a project that needed to be done in school, and the fact I couldn't attend for the entirety and after this group project, I was labeled as a betrayer by the other people in the group. I did get credits for my supposed ""part"" in the project even though I NEVER asked for it. 

Fast forward to March we all get the same groups yet again for another CS project, A documentation on various methods of defence against cyber crimes. Now this chapter about Cyber security is the largest chapter, it's like the length of FOUR different ones all put together. Even then I decided to repay them and offered to do about 50% of the work and the other 5 people would split about 10%.

But just last week, They all sent me over their ""part"" of the project together, all of which containing practically nothing but a fuck you text sideways. This confused me and I reached out to them. But in the group chat all of them flamed me for abandoning them the last time and how they expected as a Computer nerd I would do majority of the work even though I was sick. 

This pissed me off and I decided to fuck them over. The submit dates are on the 30th, I sent them the link to the google drive file but cut off access unless approval and rejected each of them several times. Then they started a group voice call to berate me about being a bad friend and to learn to take jokes. 

I had to do ALL the work myself, 50% of which IN THE PAST 3 DAYS SPENDING AROUND 8 HOURS for this. But when I talked to a mutual, they thought I went too far. So AITA? ",1.0,0.013872156850993633,0,0
94,1ceit8m,AITA for not sticking up for my friend and calling her unreasonable before her birthday?,"So I (18F) had a friend Ari (19F). A friend and I are from the same major and have most of our classes together. We initially got along well, but she later started to show her true self. She was snobby and obnoxious, bragging about her designer brands. She started ignoring me , but I eventually stopped reaching out. I realized I was the only one who called her or asked her to eat lunch together, and it was not a big deal to me. I didn't mind it as much as I had my closer friends.

Now here comes the main story:

Since the start of the year, we have been working on various projects and assignments together, with me preferring to work with a small group. However, she has consistently made 0% contribution to our projects. She has been absent from college due to her own dog biting her, a vacation to Thailand, or partying with her high school friends. This semester, we had a coding project and i asked her to write a report. I left messages for her before submission. She responded with a message stating that she was getting her nails done and the report was almost ready. The next day, she worked on the report until the minute before our presentation. I didn't say anything because her birthday was coming up, and we ended up doing fine. The same week, we had another project evaluation for a different class, and her contribution was 0%. She was stressed about not being able to book a place for her birthday party, so I did her part of work and told her not to worry.

The presentation was scheduled for her birthday, and she requested for it to be a day before the class. The professor agreed, but the group had to present together. Due to a university cancellation, the professor suggested presenting on friday or next week. However, due to lab exams, the next week was not feasible. The group members agreed to present on Friday, allowing her to celebrate and enjoy her birthday on Thursday. 

Then she private messaged me flipping out and saying she doesnt want to come to college on her bday week since she has like 2 friends there and she doesnt like it in college, then she proceeded to ask me if i think shes being unreasonable.

And I said yes, and explained to her she cannot expect these people to get more stuff on their plate during exam week just because she does not want to come.

Them agreeing on not presenting thursday was too nice in the first place and now she wants them to not present on friday as well just because she wants to party and drink.

To this she had a meltdown and wrote me a huge paragraph saying that i can villainise her all i want and call her selfish but postponing the presentation doesn't effect anyone.

I told her that the matter wasn't that serious for me to villainise her and she should calm down and look at this from a neutral standpoint when she is not upset.

She started speaking to me disrespectfully and showing me a lot of attitude so i kind of flipped out and my pent up frustration came pouring.

96,1ceil3e,AITA For ignoring my roommates requests when she ignored mine?,"Anonymous for obvious reasons, to give names, I am I/Me, my partner is Kai, and roommate is Jessica. This all started last year. I started dating my partner a few months before then, and ever since I have had them over more to hangout. At this point, they stay the night over the weekend. The apartment lease states no more than 10 days in a month and 7 days consecutively. We have not broken that rule at all since we started dating.

Jessica starts constantly asking why Kai is over, and asks to sit down to talk about the whole situation. (Context for the next part, she is disgusting. Never does her dishes, leaves moldy food in the fridge, and gets mad when we throw it out saying, ""These are still good, why are they out?"" I wish that was an exaggeration. And she treats the living room like her own bedroom.) So we do, and we work out a deal that has Kai not over 2 days a week. We were fine with that, but on the condition that she start to clean up after herself because she leaves it for us to do every weekend. Well she didn't start cleaning up, in fact it got worse, and so one of the days that Kai wasn't to come over, they started to come over again. The staying the night didn't change, that is important for later.

Nothing changed, visiting and overnights stayed the same. Still cleaning up after her, and our new roommate cleans her own stuff and stays in her room. Kai does a lot of cleaning too as a way to help me even though they don't live there because we mentally can't stand gross common areas. Jessica decided to complain about the way Kai filled the dishwasher, even though it was full. I left a just used spoon in the sink to clean later and almost as soon as I set it in there, she asked why it was there. She had her boyfriend put my Keurig single cup in a cabinet, just to put her never used SodaStream there

She reported me to management, and I got a knock on my BEDROOM door at 8am. The lease says they can do that, but they didn't try to email, call, or text me first. She reported Kai as a ""full time occupant"", that they had been doing all of their laundry there, and that they kept the spare key for the backdoor and the passcode for the front door. They only stay 2 nights a week, only does one set of clothes with my laundry, and we had the spare key together, but never just them.

The management is just as bad. Her boyfriend can stay for 11 nights straight because ""He is out of state, so we make exceptions."" which is not in the lease at all. If the sink is overflowing with one person's disgusting, moldy dishes, all occupants pay a fee. Since Kai and I are in an amazing relationship that looks like we will be together for a very long time, we started to buy things for our future to go ahead and have at the apartment for everyone to also use, including cookware and a TV and stand for it (Cats, don't want them knocking it over.)

I've always known that he wasn't that interested in me but it got worse when he got married and started having kids. His kids are 4, 2, and newborn right now. 

His car and his wife's car only fit 5 people and they have 3 kids so we can't go anywhere when I'm at their house because they don't want to take 2 cars. I also miss a lot of school on his days. He'll pick me up early on Thursdays because that's when he gets off of work and he doesn't want to wait 2 hours or drive home then come back to pick me up. Fridays and Mondays there's a 50/50 chance they'll tell me to stay home because my school is too far (it's 10 minutes from my dad's work but he doesn't want to leave early). If I do go to school on his days I'm always late then I get in trouble for being late and my aunt has to call the school to try to get me out of detention. 

I told my aunt I don't want to go to his house anymore because of the car situation and the school thing.

I've always known that he wasn't that interested in me but it got worse when he got married and started having kids. His kids are 4, 2, and newborn right now. 

His car and his wife's car only fit 5 people and they have 3 kids so we can't go anywhere when I'm at their house because they don't want to take 2 cars. I also miss a lot of school on his days. He'll pick me up early on Thursdays because that's when he gets off of work and he doesn't want to wait 2 hours or drive home then come back to pick me up. Fridays and Mondays there's a 50/50 chance they'll tell me to stay home because my school is too far (it's 10 minutes from my dad's work but he doesn't want to leave early). If I do go to school on his days I'm always late then I get in trouble for being late and my aunt has to call the school to try to get me out of detention. 

I told my aunt I don't want to go to his house anymore because of the car situation and the school thing.

103,1cehbeg,AITA for refusing to take my nephew's girlfriend out for pizza?,"I (35F) invited my nephew (18M) and his girlfriend (21F) over for dinner tonight. I do this with my niece and nephew and their SO's every few months just because it's a good way to catch up on things, I like to cook and they enjoy home cooked meals without having to lift a finger or do dishes :D . (Young people with full time jobs I get they don't cook every night)

My nephew has a new girlfriend and I invited her along, since she is an extremely picky eater (not because of mental health issues or ED's or anything just extremely picky) I asked her before hand what she liked to eat and catered a full meal to her liking with her food preferences.

I spend the whole day doing groceries and cooking today as it's my only day off from work and like I said I enjoy cooking so I do not mind this at all. And I also invited my mother so she can see her grandson and I always make way too much anyways.

I had just finished everything in prep work that I could when my nephew calls and I can tell he's sort of awkward in calling. I ask him what's up and he very carefully asks me if it's okay that we just go out for pizza instead tonight. I explain to him I rather not since i've been cooking all day and it'll just go to waste and he explains to me that his girlfriend only likes the foods she told me she liked when they come from fast food places and she's worried she won't like it so she'd rather either not come at all or go out for pizza (implied that i'm paying for all the pizza as well).

I can tell he's sorry for the drama but I inform him that im just not gonna budge on this and I won't be springing for pizza when i've been cooking  all day and that she doesn't have to come then I'll just see him and my mom. But she would prefer him staying home as well if I won't cater to her needs. And since the car is in her name I would have to go pick him up which is half an hour back and forth for me at this point and not ideal.

At this point I was annoyed and told her she was kind of being disrespectfull and entitled and he said he agreed but just couldn't deal with the drama of her right now.

I told my mom this and she said that it's financially no problem for me to spring for the pizza's and I could just portion out the food and put it in the freezer and it's about  all of us being together not about  what we actually eat and that I was being an asshole for not accomodating my guest?

so, am I the asshole?

UPDATE: Wow this blew up more than I thought it would :)!

I ended up following the advice given here and texted my nephew that if he still wanted to come by himself over I'd spring for an uber for him. He basically just texted me a bunch of hearts back so he also loved the idea!

I also ended up telling my mom the dinner was off, that way I could have the alone time with him. As he is also my godson we're very close. He said girlfriend wasn't happy he was leaving her for the night but apparantly he had told her to stick it because he was over her drama. We had a great dinner together the two of us and he talked a lot about his doubts in his relationship and is concidering breaking up with her not just over this but many other things.

It ended up being a really fun evening just the two of us, and I send him home with a big batch of Auntie's special brown butter brownies (just yummy special not ""special"" :D before you all ask LOL!)

So thanks everybody for all the great advice <3

Whether it‚Äôs how he looks, how his house looks, how his car looks, he just doesn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôll wear jeans with holes in them, shoes that are ripped apart, his long hair will be all tangled and unbrushed and unparted/wild, and his shirts will have stains all over them. It‚Äôs hard for him to find something ‚Äúnice‚Äù to wear for us to go out to eat. 

I‚Äôve hated it for the decade+ that we‚Äôve been together. I‚Äôll buy him new clothes and shoes just for him to ruin them almost immediately or lose them somehow. I‚Äôll try to hint or tell him to brush his hair, and he‚Äôll just joke that he likes it that way and not do anything about it. I‚Äôve never gotten mad at him or anything because it‚Äôs his life, but it‚Äôs really embarrassing in public and it makes me not want to be seen with him sometimes. 

My husband‚Äôs been out of town for a week and we didn‚Äôt get home from the airport until after midnight and our toddler woke up early, so I got up and let my husband sleep in. He still got up early anyway, and in a weird mood. When our kid went down for a nap we went on the front porch around 11am for a smoke.

We‚Äôd normally go out back but our annoying neighbor was back there next to our porch so we opted to go out front instead, hoping for peace.

I made a kinda-joke like ‚Äúbright pajama pants eh?‚Äù And my husband says that I‚Äôm wearing sweatpants and it‚Äôs the exact same thing.

That‚Äôs when I said it was embarrassing when we wears things like that.

This set me off a little and I honestly refused to back down. I told him he‚Äôs being absolutely ridiculous and that this is typical of him refusing to just admit things or try and actually reflect on things, and instead blame me or make it about me ‚Äúcoming at him‚Äù.

I mean, I get that it‚Äôs our house and it‚Äôs ‚Äútechnically not noon yet‚Äù (whatever that means) but I‚Äôm appalled that it devolved into pajamas and sweatpants being the same thing.

106,1ceh2w7,"WIBTA For trying to catch my friend in a lie, if he didn‚Äôt lie.","Me (24f) and and my friend (25m) have been friends since we were little kids. We‚Äôve never had an argument, we are really open and care about each other a lot. Our friendship has always been platonic, but we have been through a lot of trauma together that seems to have made us really close as friends. 

For the last 6 months or so, my friend has been lying a lot. It‚Äôs always been little lies but it‚Äôs new for him. The more worrying ones were about his finances and savings as we were planning on moving out together, and he was not financially able to but pretended he was. I talked to him about it and he admitted he wasn‚Äôt ready to move out. I said that was okay and made the decision to move out independently, which he seemed okay with.  

The smaller lies didn‚Äôt stop and I encouraged him to talk to his therapist about it as it was worrying and he admitted he didn‚Äôt like it. 

Yesterday he made a big lie to a friend. He then lied to me but came clean a few hours later. I told him I was upset with him but appreciated him owning up to it. I encouraged him again to talk to his therapist and he said he would. I vented about it to my mum and she noticed a lot of information was wrong and I think he‚Äôs actually lied a lot more to me. 

He was supposed to get a train to meet some people for a wedding event in London, but said to me that the train broke down and he could not afford another ticket. He also said the trains and coaches were not available to London and were too uncommon to rely on. He told his friend that he couldn‚Äôt go because his grandad is in hospital, the big lie. I offered him a solution to which he said he‚Äôd do multiple times which he didn‚Äôt (the lie to me). My mum pointed out that London is a capital city and there are plenty of trains that go there. She also said when a train goes down, a replacement for travel is often made for passengers if possible. 

I asked him today if he got a refund and I‚Äôm waiting for his reply. I feel like crap for trying to catch him but I feel like I can‚Äôt trust him right now. I‚Äôm so angry with him and I‚Äôm angry with myself for that. I‚Äôm also confused why it matters so much to me when it has no real impact on my life if his train broke down or not. 

I checked the train disruptions for yesterday just now and found no information relating to his train. 

TLDR:
Am I the asshole for trying to catch my close friend in another lie when it has no impact on my life, but causes me anxiety in our friendship as his lying has changed from small to big? Should I just let it go or should we talk about it?

Edit:
I called him and asked him if he lied. He seemed really anxious and said that the train did breakdown. I pointed out that there are a lot of other trains and coaches going to London usually to which he said ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù and nothing more. I pushed it a little and he said the ticket wasn‚Äôt transferable which I checked and isn‚Äôt true. I don‚Äôt think pushing it more will be helpful as he doesn‚Äôt seem able to communicate atm and it‚Äôs just hurting. I suggested he talks to his doctor about his mental health medication as it could be why he is more tired and having headaches lately, and I said it could be making him more anxious too (as he thinks the lying is a stress response).

108,1cegnmm,AITA for skipping a celebration for my sister?,"My (16m) younger sister (12f) was born way early and almost didn't make it. For the first year of her life I lived with my aunt and uncle because my parents wanted to devote as much time to her as they could and didn't want to worry about me in that time. I came home when she finally did. She has chronic health stuff from being born so early. She's had a few surgeries since she left the hospital too. I remember my parents adoring her so much and celebrating every tiny milestone she hit and making it into a very big celebration.

I was jealous, I admit. My parents attention was focused so much on her that I was overlooked a lot and I still am. They cheer on every little thing for her and don't notice anything for me. I was given an award at the end of middle school for best artist and my parents didn't show up to it, they didn't mention it, and I know they got the emails and I gave them a note from my teacher about the ceremony and how parents needed to be there at 2. I mentioned it to them and they seemed so disinterested. It pissed me off.

Another reason for the focus being on my sister so much is when she was in first grade her school went on a field trip and there was an accident. My parents were freaking out and going crazy with worry and after she got back safe and unharmed they were saying how she really was a miracle and they almost lost her twice and how she was the most precious thing in the world to them.

My sister got so used to talking about herself and her struggles that she takes over things for other people. She brought it up at our cousins wedding and so many of her classes birthday parties that my parents get calls to pick her up early most of the time. But she really adores me and wants us to be so close and always wants to hang out but she also talks about how sick she was and early she was born and how special she is. It annoys me. I don't like my sister. I don't even know that I love her. Part of me resents her. Like I know this is on our parents and they're at fault. But I hate being around her. I hate that she loves me. I wish she would focus on others because I'd rather not be in the same room as her. I don't want to celebrate her.

My sister got some early report card that was all A's for the first time. My parents decided to throw a party to celebrate her. She told me how excited she was and wanted me there. I didn't want to go. I hated the idea of celebrating her achievements. So I just didn't show up. I went to a friends house. My parents only cared or noticed when my sister got upset that I wasn't there.

I was grounded for two weeks and it just ended. My parents told me it wasn't fair to my sister to skip something so important for her. Something so huge. I asked them when I was celebrated like that and they told me it wasn't about me, it's about her. My sister has been so different since. I hear her cry sometimes. So I know it did hurt her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-27,"AITA for skipping a celebration for my sister? My (16m) younger sister (12f) was born way early and almost didn't make it. For the first year of her life I lived with my aunt and uncle because my parents wanted to devote as much time to her as they could and didn't want to worry about me in that time. I came home when she finally did. She has chronic health stuff from being born so early. She's had a few surgeries since she left the hospital too. I remember my parents adoring her so much and celebrating every tiny milestone she hit and making it into a very big celebration.

I was jealous, I admit. My parents attention was focused so much on her that I was overlooked a lot and I still am. They cheer on every little thing for her and don't notice anything for me. I was given an award at the end of middle school for best artist and my parents didn't show up to it, they didn't mention it, and I know they got the emails and I gave them a note from my teacher about the ceremony and how parents needed to be there at 2. I mentioned it to them and they seemed so disinterested. It pissed me off.

Another reason for the focus being on my sister so much is when she was in first grade her school went on a field trip and there was an accident. My parents were freaking out and going crazy with worry and after she got back safe and unharmed they were saying how she really was a miracle and they almost lost her twice and how she was the most precious thing in the world to them.

My sister got so used to talking about herself and her struggles that she takes over things for other people. She brought it up at our cousins wedding and so many of her classes birthday parties that my parents get calls to pick her up early most of the time. But she really adores me and wants us to be so close and always wants to hang out but she also talks about how sick she was and early she was born and how special she is. It annoys me.

109,1cefb9m,AITA for refusing to bring materials to my stepdaughter so she can do school work while recovering from surgery?,"I (40f) married my husband when my stepdaughter Elise (17f) was 6 years old. I met Elise when she was just 3. My husband and Elise's mom had been divorced since Elise was a few months old. Elise's mother was already married to someone else when I met my husband. To make a very long story short. Elise's mother started to hate me during my engagement to my husband. Her husband at the time hit on me in front of my husband and his ex. For some reason she blamed me and not him. Then a few months later and days before our wedding she learned he had cheated on her multiple times. I was blamed for this.

This led to parental alienation, which my husband and I tried to end and attempted to prevent it from working on Elise. But it worked very well. Elise was brainwashed by her mom to be as unkind to me as possible. This unkindness turned into some very bad moments where she pretended not to know me while we were out (even once or twice when my husband was with us and had stepped away). She also refused to acknowledge her half siblings as any kind of siblings. She has always called herself an only child. She looked me in the eye and wished me dead on two separate occasions. Apparently her mom wished for the same thing.

When Elise was 13 a big fight played out in court but ultimately Elise's wishes were heard and she went to live with her mom full time. She sees my husband two Saturdays a month as ordered by the courts. Occasionally she will see me or her half siblings while out and she is as unkind as ever to me when she sees me.

Elise had surgery a week and a half ago. She won't be back at school for a few weeks yet. They have been emailing on work for her to do but Thursday they had some materials to send to her home so she could complete certain projects. I was near the school and was asked by my husband's mother to pick up the materials for Elise. Elise's mother also told me to do it (she did not ask). I told them I felt it would be better for someone else to collect them seeing as my presence is so unwanted. I told my MIL that I knew I would be facing disrespect the second I got to Elise and her mom's house.

MIL told me I just proved to Elise that I don't care about her at all and I never loved her unconditionally as a parent when I wouldn't sacrifice for her.

I can relate, my sis sn‚Äôt around all the time. Usually it‚Äôs just me, my aunt and my cousin and yes, she raised him so of course they agree on a lot of things. It is what it is. It‚Äôs just exhausting trying to prove a point to two people that constantly gas each other up, encourage and validate each other.

I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not their intention, that‚Äôs how it feels to anyone arguing against the two. 

I‚Äôm a huge person on prioritizing mental health and you know, that‚Äôs my sister. So I spoke to her SPECIFICALLY and said ‚Äúforget it, it‚Äôs a lost cause‚Äù, after she LITERALLY put her head down in frustration. - I‚Äôm sitting right next to her, so my intention wasn‚Äôt for the whole car to hear.

Immediate uproar. My aunt , in a strong tone says,  ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong,  You can‚Äôt say that, you‚Äôre dismissing the conversation‚Äù. Cuzzo is agreeing with her, they‚Äôre talking at the same time, so it‚Äôs loud.

I‚Äôm now annoyed because she just said my opinion is wrong (i‚Äôve bitten my tongue for a lot to ‚Äúkeep the peace‚Äù and I made a promise that I won‚Äôt do that anymore. it‚Äôs dehumanizing.)

I said I‚Äôm just speaking how I feel.

They say  ‚Äú that‚Äôs not how you stop a conversation, it‚Äôs dismissing us.‚Äù I told them I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entitled to my opinion, why are you yelling?‚Äù

She says in a very loud, strong tone ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like I was yelling, you‚Äôre LYING on my name. You‚Äôre a LIAR. I won‚Äôt stand here and let you LIE on my name‚Äù. She made me look up the definition of yelling and surprise I was right.  

So let‚Äôs check in, within a couple of minutes you said my opinion is WRONG and im a LIAR. At no point did I name call.

Side note - I did tell her last year (which she brought up) that she acts like she knows everything and she proved that point. I can‚Äôt give my opinion without immediately being told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù.

My mom (43f) is a SAHM and she does a wonderful job taking care of the apartment. She left her job about a year or so ago and tries to find herself in freelance (SMM, targeting and related fields). My sister (19) left her job three weeks ago to pursue a career of a tattoo artist, she did some courses in January while still working. She had 3 models on that training and after quitting the official job had 2 on her own. So, she just stays at home doing what she wants. 

I'm an office worker, 5/2, 8AM - 4PM, an hour trip to/from home. 

Basically, throughout my life my sister and I did most of the choirs when we were in school, college and so on but then the dynamic changed when mom decided to stay at home. We (my sister and I) did the occasional dish washing, vacuuming, cleaning, washing when we saw something needs to be done but still most of the work was done by mom. 

But now, every weekend I get asked something like ""when I'd prefer to participate in the cleaning, Saturday or Sunday"". I know for some of you you might seem like not of a big deal but I'm generally a person with low energy bars, which I constantly get joked on by my family members. So, this cleaning takes a couple of hours and feels like an additional work day for me. 

When I was on my vacation and my sister was working I never asked her to do anything, I willingly suggested to mom that we do the weekly cleaning when my sister is working so everything is done by the weekend and she can just rest. 

I feel like they don't treat me fairly but I keep quiet and just go along with them.

P. S. I'm 22F.

edited: some people are asking what I contribute in terms of money. There is no set amount because every month is different. I don't specifically pay for rent but I buy all the needed groceries 1-3 times a week. 
My family is a bit tough on money and I earn the average wage for my country (which is not exactly little for one person living with parents). So I contribute a lot to paying for community facilities, for my little brothers' needs, or when we need something at home. since I got the job 1 year ago I started paying for whatever I can when my parents were figuring out their issues with work. when my sister was working officially, she paid for things too but since she earned less than me, I willingly made sure to contribute more.",Asshole,2024-04-27,"AITA for expecting my family to do our weekly cleaning without me because at the moment I'm the only one working full time?

When I was on my vacation and my sister was working I never asked her to do anything, I willingly suggested to mom that we do the weekly cleaning when my sister is working so everything is done by the weekend and she can just rest. 

I feel like they don't treat me fairly but I keep quiet and just go along with them.

P. S. I'm 22F.

edited: I'm the eldest child of four. beside my sister I also have two brothers (6 and 10 y.o.). thought it is worth mentioning.

edited: some people are asking what I contribute in terms of money. There is no set amount because every month is different. I don't specifically pay for rent but I buy all the needed groceries 1-3 times a week. 
My family is a bit tough on money and I earn the average wage for my country (which is not exactly little for one person living with parents). So I contribute a lot to paying for community facilities, for my little brothers' needs, or when we need something at home. since I got the job 1 year ago I started paying for whatever I can when my parents were figuring out their issues with work. when my sister was working officially, she paid for things too but since she earned less than me, I willingly made sure to contribute more.",1.0,1.0543043613433838,1,1

117,1cebrj1,AITA for forgetting to include my sister in my wedding?,"About a year and a half ago, my fianc√©e (28F) and I (27F) started planning our wedding. We wanted a small, intimate affair with only 65 guests, including the wedding party. My sister (30F) , who stays across the country, was supposed to be my maid of honor, and she enthusiastically helped with the planning until she faced a serious health issue about a month ago.  
Due to her health problems, my sister was advised not to travel after her surgeries, which meant she would miss the wedding. After discussing it with my fianc√©e, I offered to postpone the wedding so my sister could attend, but she insisted we stick to our original plans because she knew how important they were to me. I told her that i would be replacing her as the maid of honor with my childhood friend, and she was perfectly okay with it.   
Fast forward to two days ago, our wedding day. Everything seemed perfect until I spotted my sister sitting with my parents during the ceremony. It turns out she had gotten clearance from her doctor to travel last minute and surprised us by showing up. I was really happy to see her.  
after the ceremony she came over to talk to me and told me everything. amidst all the hugs and congratulations, i completely forgot that we had not planned for her to be there. due to the limited people at the wedding, we had strict seating charts and catered meals for everyone, as well as the wedding favours. it turns out, my sister didnt get to eat that night and just ate a few of the table appetisers, which were very small . she also didnt have a proper chair and one of the venue workers got her a completely mismatching one from elsewhere, and she had to squeeze in next to our cousin. the wedding party and us (total 9 people) all sat at the front of the hall on a long table, facing everyone.    
This morning, my sister calmly called and explained how excluded she felt at the wedding. I told her that yes, we didnt have extra favours/seats because of how strictly we budgeted for it. she understood but also felt that i couldve been more inclusive  by asking her to sit at the bridal table since she was originally supposed to be a MOH, or getting her a meal .

 she felt very judged the whole night and  the least i could do was try to include her after she flew all the way down. i apologised profusely because, had i not been so caught up with everything , i wouldve definitely tried to get her a meal from somewhere. but i also explained to her that she wouldnt have been able to sit with the wedding party  as we had a color scheme that she didnt match, and that she should know how detailed the guest list was for favours/seats . the conversation got a quite heated , and she said ""well i guess it wouldve been better for you if i was still bedridden and i didnt come at all"" and abrupty hung up the phone, though i know that line was probably an emotional outburst because of how hurt she was.

118,1cebnpz,AITA for turning down a 'girls day' with my stepmom and stepsister?,"So I'm (15m) not a girl. But I do like a lot of stuff that people would consider ""girly"". I think it's dumb to label stuff that way but it happens, it'll always happen on some level and I'm used to it.

In February 2020 my dad got remarried to Shauna. Shauna brought her 3 year old Missy into the marriage. Dad brought me and my older brother Devon (20m). Our mom died 7 years ago and Missy's dad left Shauna and didn't want to have any part in Missy's life. When Shauna and my dad first got married/moved in together (it happened at the same time) Shauna's niece Lizzie was around a lot and basically like a daughter to Shauna and a sister to Missy. But a year ago Shauna and Lizzie had a huge fight and Lizzie is no longer around. Missy misses her a lot. Lizzie did not stay in touch with Missy.

Dev doesn't live with us and typically when I see him it's because he takes me out and spends time with me and I stayed with him a few times as well. But he doesn't have a relationship with Missy really so she's never included in that. He's also not that close with dad really. So he doesn't really visit us all much.

Ever since Lizzie stopped seeing Missy she's been struggling a lot and Shauna and my dad both try to involve her in extra curricular's or friends to help make up for the loss of that relationship.

Missy asked me to go for a girls day with her and Shauna. She said I'm her brother now and she'd like if I joined the girls days since I like baking already and shopping. I told her it was nice for her to invite me but I didn't wanna go. She asked how come and I said I like doing other stuff on my weekends. She begged me to come and said I never spend any time with her (this is true) and asked how I can be her big brother if I never spend any time with her or get to know her. I told her some real siblings don't spend time together.

She told Shauna I said no and Shauna asked me why I couldn't spend a few hours getting to know them and she told me it meant a lot to Missy. I told her I know it did but I wanted to do other things. She asked me why I didn't want to make Missy happy and I told her it's not my job. She spoke to dad about it then and the two of them tried to talk me into going. Dad said he wasn't going to make me go because it would upset Missy more if I was being forced and it was clear. He told me after everything Missy has been through it would be nice. He said she gets upset when I go with Dev and she gets left behind. He also told me I could be the big brother to Missy that Dev is to me and I'd have a brother and a sister. He also told me Shauna and I might bond and maybe I'd see her as more like a parent instead of just like his spouse.

I told them I still didn't want to go. Shauna told me I could have made Missy so happy by saying yes and rejecting it was rejecting Missy. Dad told me he was disappointed I couldn't find any wish to spend some time with two members of my family. They also explained how wrong I was.

119,1cebnby,"AITA for letting my kids disturb my husband during an important work meeting, after he said he would handle them for a day to prove how easy my job is?","I'm 31F and my husband is 36M. We have two boys, a 5yr old and a 7yr old. My husband works in an office and he has the option to work a few days a week from home, but he prefers not to because he says it's easier to focus in the office. I run a small business from home. I don't have a lot of daily work, just some emails and planning (maybe 3 hours a day?)  but the business does make about a third of our household income. But my younger son is home all day and just dealing with him takes a lot of energy. He's really high energy and will probably wreck something if you leave him alone for an hour. And then the older one comes home at 3 and both of them are with me until 8 or 9, which is when my husband usually comes home. A few days ago, I was really tired and I didn't make dinner. When my husband came home I asked him if we could just order something. He was also tired and we were both short tempered so we ended up snapping at each other. 

He said I should have at least ordered before he got home and he was hungry, I said I forgot and it's not fair that food is always my problem. He said that I'm home all day and I even admit I don't have much work to do, so I'm basically a SAHM and should at least take care of dinner. I said he has no idea how much I do everyday, and he said he'd handle the kids for an entire day while also working from home just to prove it should be easy for me. I said sure, so he made the arrangements to work from home yesterday. 

  
I slept in, and when I woke up he was already frazzled from getting the older one ready for school. He ended up having to cancel a meeting to make breakfast, and was worried about that. Then when he took another meeting later on, the boys went out to play in the yard and got super muddy and left footprints all over the house. which he then had to mop, and I didn't help at all. By this point I did feel sort of guilty because it was definitely harder for him to take care of work at the same time, but all I wanted was an apology. He said he was doing this to show that I do nothing all day, and if he just admitted he was wrong I would have helped out straight away. 

Later on he had another meeting, and he told the boys not to bother him for an hour. But about 20 mins in, they got in an argument about something and our younger one went into my husband's room to complain. He was really loud and my husband's video was also on, then he told the kid to leave him alone but he was upset and crying and wasn't listening. After a few mins my husband went back to the meeting and apologized to the other people. when it was finished, he was really angry at me. he said I could see what was happening and I just watched him struggle without helping. I said all you had to say was please help, he said I shouldn't be so petty and prideful. This probably made him look a bit stupid in front of his manager, but it was only a few minutes and I don't think It was the huge deal he made it out to be.

120,1ceb0qw,AITA for not seeing my best friend on a visit home?,"This happened a few years ago, but I still wonder‚Ä¶

I come from a very small town. Everybody knows everybody and everything. Lee was my best friend for years. She was MOH in my wedding. I stayed at her house whenever I went home to visit. We were super close. 

I had an unfortunate series of events happen within almost a year. My mother passed away from cancer. It was brutal. My cheating husband decided he was done with me. I was now a single mother with two small children. Emotionally, I was a complete wreck. 

Without warning, a beloved aunt (who helped raise me‚Ä¶ almost like a bonus mom) died unexpectedly. I was beyond devastated. And kinda at a breaking point. 

I flew home for a short weekend. There was no funeral. But I went home to support my uncle and honor my aunt. I told Lee I was coming home, but wouldn‚Äôt be staying at her house. I wouldn‚Äôt be seeing her either. It wasn‚Äôt a social visit. I stayed with my sister and we just spent time with my uncle. 

Here is where I may (or may not) have been an asshole. I found out an old friend‚Äôs band was playing at a bar right down the street from my sister‚Äôs house. I went to see him play. I desperately needed an escape from everything. My sister dropped me off. I sat by myself getting shit-faced drunk and watching the band. Then my sister picked me up. End of story. I flew home the next day. 

Speaking with Lee a couple days later‚Ä¶ I told her I‚Äôd gone to see the band by myself. She was pissed. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call me??? I would have met you there!‚Äù I tried calmly explaining that it wasn‚Äôt a social visit. I sat alone and got drunk by choice. I didn‚Äôt have words to socialize and make small talk. ‚ÄúI would have sat there quietly!‚Äù For the record? We used to be roommates. Lee has never been quiet a day in her life. She talks nonstop. I love her, but I just didn‚Äôt have the capacity for nonstop chatter. 

I told her that I was sorry her feelings were hurt. I meant no disrespect to her. It was a spur of the moment thing. I just needed an escape. She was still pissed. She kept harping on about it. I apologized several more times. I felt bad that her feelings were hurt. But this trip wasn‚Äôt about her. I was just trying to process losing a second mother so soon after losing my actual mother. I don‚Äôt even drink. That should have been a huge red flag to people who know me. I wasn‚Äôt handling things well. 

After several more apologies? She still wouldn‚Äôt let it go. I calmly told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôve apologized numerous times. I truly am sorry your feelings were hurt. But I am not going to keep apologizing fifty more times. I am done with this conversation. You can call me when you decide to accept my apology and move on.‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt spoken with her since. Apparently, she never got over it. Some people say I should have just called her to meet me at the bar. Other people understand that I needed to be alone. I hate that I lost my best friend over this. But I kinda feel that I had a right to grieve whatever way worked best for me.

Me (39F) and my husband (43M) have been together 9 years and married 3. We have 3 kids (14, 13 and 5) but the older 2 are his from a previous marriage. We‚Äôve been renting for our whole relationship, but I‚Äôve always been keen to buy. Our landlord is now selling, which means we have to move.

We had a meeting with a mortgage advisor this week. Ahead of the meeting, husband said he had a poor credit history and wasn‚Äôt sure we‚Äôd get a mortgage because of some missed credit card payments. When I looked at both our credit scores, the average puts us in the range of being accepted for a mortgage so I wasn‚Äôt worried. Come the meeting, it‚Äôs revealed that he‚Äôs sitting on ¬£40k+ of debt, spread over loans and credit cards. It felt like a complete gut punch to find out that way - I think I was in shock because I didn‚Äôt really react initially and it took me a few days of floating through life to really comprehend what this means for us and our relationship. 

I tried to have it out with him last night after our youngest was in bed (older 2 at their mum‚Äôs) and his reaction was so defensive and aggressive. He basically said he isn‚Äôt good with money, chronically overspends and always has and what do I want him to say? He then left and went to the pub, leaving me with our 5yo who had woken up crying.

It‚Äôs less about the money (though that‚Äôs terrifies me as someone debt averse) but more that he didn‚Äôt talk to me about it at any point in our relationship. Also worth noting that his mum left us ¬£50k for a deposit and he spend ¬£40k of that 2 years ago clearing debt. I feel like the trust is gone. 

I want to get through this but I can‚Äôt see him putting in any emotional effort to understand my position. His approach is to carry on like nothing‚Äôs happened, as we did after the inheritance spend was revealed.

123,1ceatml,AITA for getting an attitude with my bf?,"Hiya everyone, so let me start with this off with I'm new here so I don't fully understand how all this works. 

Me (20F) and my bf (19M) have been together for awhile, and he's started a business about 2 months ago. 

During this time, some things went wrong, and now he's scared to go outside by himself. So for the past month I've been walking the shops back and forth to either get food and other items or pull money out for him. 

Here's my issue, he gets me to walk up there about 3 times a day. And I'm getting sick of it, I'm about 14 weeks pregnant and I'm exhausted and just want a break. Yesterday was especially bad, I was getting really bad back pain and was struggling to walk and I needed him to walk up to the shops by himself to go get his money out and a few other items but he didn't want to, so I tagged along, trying to be understanding about his fear. 

When we got there, he reliazed he forgot his card so he couldn't pull money out and he needed to apparently give this money to a mate. So we needed to run back up there, but I didn't want to, I was tired and was feeling extremely sick and my back was killing me. When I asked him to do it he got upset with me and started using an angry tone and even though it upset me, I didnt use one back until we got home where he wouldn't let me sit down for even five minutes before he rushed me out the door. 

I got a bit of an attitude with him and he called me a bitch and lazy. I got more upset and just left to go get out his money. When I got home, he still had an attitude with me, and when I told him that I was tired, sick he told me to grow up you gronk (it's an Australian terms for idiot or that your lazy and dirty) I got more upset and used a tone with him again telling to stop. He just rolled his eyes at me and called me a bitch again. That's the end of it, AITA? 

Edit: I relaized I left some information out. He didn't wanna walk back up with me because he was tired and didn't wanna go, and he wanted me to go for him and that this money that needed to be pulled out according to him was really important and needed to be done quickly since his mate was on the way to get it. The walk to the shops is about 30 mintues there and back. And some days he's willing to walk by himself and other days he says he doesn't want to because ""how would you feel if what happened to me happend to you?""

124,1ceagu9,AITA for telling my husband to listen to his kids because I'd be the one facing the repercussions if he doesn't?,"I (36f) have been married to my husband Nick (42m) for almost 6 years now. My husband has two teenagers with his ex-wife Lyndsey (40f) and they have been divorced for 11 years. My stepdaughter is Melody (15f) and my stepson is Jace (13m). My husband and I also have a 14 month old son together.

Nick and Lyndsey have shared custody of my stepkids. And typically they can get along okay...ish. It's not what anyone would call a friendly co-parenting relationship and both can be stubborn with the other at times. I'd hate to see them forced to sit in a room all day to mediate but it's not as bad as some divorced people I have seen in my life. My relationship with Lyndsey is not good anymore. Around a year into my marriage she grew annoyed that she and Nick would be harder to reach than me and I was getting more calls from the kids school when they were sick or whatever. Jace has some health issues so it's a common enough thing for him. It made Lyndsey extremely jealous and on her custody time I would be calling her to try and get the kid who was sick or to make plans with her. But her job made it difficult for her to be reached hence me being the only one available to pick them up. Once we got to the point where she was jealous there was no going back. I had hoped during Covid and the kids not being in school that it would maybe take care of some of the jealousy, but it didn't. And once she turned against me so did the kids. We had a close relationship before and now they don't want that with me. They complain if Nick leaves them with me for a couple of hours or when I pick them up from school. They're not as open and talkative with me. I spoke to them, Nick spoke to them, he spoke to Lyndsey and we even did some family therapy together but the relationship is not what it was and it's not what it was becoming before the issues.

I bring all this up because recently my husband learned that during his parenting time he will be out of town for four days in May and those four days fall on his parenting time with my stepkids. He wants them to stay with me for the four days so he can see them for a few hours on the day he comes back before they go to their moms. The kids do not want to stay at the house with me during that time. They want to be with their mom. They were pissed he wanted them to stay with me. It started a fight between the three of them and the kids told Lyndsey and she wants the kids to be with her, but the parenting agreement doesn't have a clause about this.

I told Nick he should listen to the kids and he told me it won't help anything if they refuse to stay in the house with me while he's not there. I told him he better listen to the kids because I'll be the one facing the repercussions of him not doing so. He told me I should want the kids with me and I told him not when I'll be dealing with their anger and disrespect while he's gone.

125,1cea57y,AITA for not wanting cancel plans with my bestfriend to spend time with my girlfriend after a fight. ,"Context:

Recently my bestfriend (26F) moved into the same city and she's been going through a tough time recently. She just broke up with her boyfriend (3-4 year relationship) and she was house hunting because she got kicked out of her previous house although she found a new one recently. Considering all this I wanted be a good friend by offering her to use my car to move some of her stuff to her new house. However, my girlfriend is now asking me to cancel plans with her and spend time with her instead. 

Me (25M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been dating for over a year now. We both work in jobs that require us to go on frequent field visits which means there are 1-2 week stretches where we don't see each other and have to keep in touch via video calls, phone calls and so on. This time we had a really bad fight during our time away from each other and now she wants me to cancel my plan with my best friend so that we can spend the day with each other talking about what happened and also have quality time with each other. 

My girlfriend's ex treated her really badly in the relationship and would deprioritise her all the time to go hang out with his friends. So, when I told her that I can't do that because I had made a commitment to help my best friend move into her new house it triggered her. She's telling me now that she would be fine with me hanging out with her on any other day and  the primary reason of asking me to do this is because of the fight and how long we've been away from each other. 

I finally caved and told her that I would spend the day with her but I can't help but feel like I would resent her for making me do this. Now, I also feel really guilty for now ditching my best friend.

i would be completely fine with letting her use it and take except for the fact she is never back when she says she‚Äôs gonna be back. and im not talking like 30 minutes/ an hour late. she is ALWAYS several hours late- often multiple days straight gone with it. lord only knows what she is doing for that long but it makes me furious when she asks to go to the store for 30 minutes and then she doesn‚Äôt come back for days when i have to go to school or work.(she doesn‚Äôt work) i also pay for everything of the car, the registration, insurance, car payments.

 it got to the point where i would never let her take my car because she was inconsiderate and a liar and she would straight up steal my keys and take my car for days. should i mind you- there‚Äôs no electricity in our house. she can‚Äôt afford to pay it. she would very often leave me for days home alone,  in her house with no electricity, no phone, no food.

now i‚Äôve moved out of her house and live with my grandma. so it‚Äôs a usual day and i wake up to go pick up my grandmas prescription after she was in the er the night before. i walk out and see my car is gone. this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened so i immediately know who it is. luckily i have an airtag in my car solely because my mom steals my car. i‚Äôm furious and past my limit of letting this slide. i call my best friend and ask her to help me get my car back and we start heading over. 

side note: she also has crashed/ gotten impounded every car she‚Äôs ever had. she goes thru cars like baby diapers because she‚Äôs such a bad driver with a terrible driving record. she ruins every car she ever touches and it heavily worries me that i‚Äôm going to get a phone call that my car has been crashed abandoned in a ditch and assumed it‚Äôs my fault.

luckily i also have a spare key. after a few hours of tracking her down i find my car parked in a motel about 30 minuets away from home. it‚Äôs the middle of the night by now, probably 4 am and my car has been missing for almost 24 hours. normally when this happens i wait for her to come out of wherever she is and drive her home. but not only did she steal my car, she had no regard for the fact my grandma needs her medication, and i have work. AND she has done this numerous times before.im just past my limit at this point.

 so i decide to get in my car and leave without her but with all her stuff including her phone that she left in the car. she calls me the next day furious that i left her stranded but i felt it was completely rational of me to get in my car and leave her.

edit: ive never reported it stolen or anything like that because i don‚Äôt want to get her into legal trouble, neither of us can afford that and she is still my mother i don‚Äôt want to ruin her life like that, but she needs to stop stealing my car and i don‚Äôt know how else to stop it",Not the A-hole,2024-04-27,"AITA for leaving my mom 30 minutes away from home? i (18f) have a pretty sour relationship with my mom. basically, when i was 16 years old my aunt(her sister) passed away and my family decided that i would inherent her car as my first car. my mom has always been salty at the fact i got my aunts car instead of her(it is a nice a car and she didn‚Äôt- and still doesn‚Äôt have a car) so up until i moved out of her house a year later it was a constant fight over the car, even though it was given to me, she insisted that it was hers too since i am her daughter.

luckily i also have a spare key. after a few hours of tracking her down i find my car parked in a motel about 30 minuets away from home. it‚Äôs the middle of the night by now, probably 4 am and my car has been missing for almost 24 hours. normally when this happens i wait for her to come out of wherever she is and drive her home. but not only did she steal my car, she had no regard for the fact my grandma needs her medication, and i have work. AND she has done this numerous times before.im just past my limit at this point.

 so i decide to get in my car and leave without her but with all her stuff including her phone that she left in the car. she calls me the next day furious that i left her stranded but i felt it was completely rational of me to get in my car and leave her.

edit: ive never reported it stolen or anything like that because i don‚Äôt want to get her into legal trouble, neither of us can afford that and she is still my mother i don‚Äôt want to ruin her life like that, but she needs to stop stealing my car and i don‚Äôt know how else to stop it",0.0,-0.014887032099068165,0,1
128,1ce9pe8,AITA for charging $50 plus petrol money to drop my sister‚Äôs friend‚Äôs ID off at the club?,"Changed some details to maintain anonymity. 


Last night my (24F) sister Chloe (21F) and a group of 7 friends (21-23M/F) went out to celebrate one of their birthdays. They went to a restaurant and then planned on clubbing afterwards. Everyone came to our house for pres and to get ready, and then our mum dropped them off at the restaurant. Upon arriving at the restaurant, one of the boys, Jay (21M) realised he had left his ID at our house and wouldn‚Äôt be able to go clubbing with everyone after. 


Chloe called me at 8:30PM and asked if I would bring Jay‚Äôs ID for a fee. I offered to do it for $50AUD ($32USD) plus any petrol money. For context, we live semi-rurally so the restaurant is a 30 minute drive away, and petrol is currently $2.20 ($1.44USD) per litre at the moment. It is nearing winter so it‚Äôs cold, plus I was ready to go to bed and watch tv. Anything below $50 is not enough incentive for me to get up and drive an hour round trip at night to drop off an ID to someone that‚Äôs not even my friend. 


Jay initially declined and told me not to worry about it but called back 15 minutes later to ask if I could bring it and that he would pay the $50 and petrol money. I said yes and did the trip and he paid me $50. Now it‚Äôs the next day and my sister and her friends are saying charging $50 for a 30 minute drive is outrageous and that I totally ripped him off.


 I said that I‚Äôm not doing an hour round trip to make only $30 profit after petrol money and wear and tear on my car. They said that I should‚Äôve just done it for $30 and that it would‚Äôve been equivalent to working for an hour at a job anyway. Jay basically said I took advantage of the situation because I knew their entire night would be ruined if he can‚Äôt get into the clubs with them, and that he believes $50 is more than enough payment so he won‚Äôt be transferring me extra for petrol fees. 


So am I an asshole for charging $50 + petrol money to drop off his ID?

129,1ce9l07,AITA for telling my husband that he is not a Chef,"My husband and I got into a stupid argument yesterday about going to a high-end restaurant. This restaurant is literally right around the corner from our house and they host James Beard nominees and awardees. I was getting a little sad about not being able to try it out yet since we are not that far away and we are moving soon. This triggered the argument. 

My husband literally said (and believe) that he is a Chef and we can get high quality ingredients and cook similar to the ways that they may cook at the restaurant. I told him absolutely not...we are not Chefs. He told me that he is a Chef. I told him he is NOT a Chef. Does he like to cook? Yes...Can he cook? Debatable. He added chicken to water to boil it and seasoned the water not the chicken and not with fresh aromtic herbs and vegetables....dried spices. You decide. 

He truly believes that he is a Chef and I am trying to tell him that he is not a professionally-trained individual who learned techniques and skills in cooking to say that he is a Chef. 

My purpose is to level set (and maybe go to this restaurant before we leave the area), but my husband is truly convinced that he is a Chef to the point that he wants to argue his point. Should I feed into his delusion to be an agreeable wife or should I stay steadfast in the truth? Please note that he has other amazing strengths that I give him props, but this is not one of them.

Some sort of tedious document re organising job was requested to my co-worker.
My co-worker and I have been mostly ok but there was bit of tension recently. This is due to communications and teamwork.
For my defence, co-worker's attitude wasn't so pleasant recently 

e.g.
just in general that my co worker would interrupt me when I am in middle of something (which I don't mind at all but not) when I would inevitably, interrupt my coworker, actively expresses the frustration. Occasionally my co worker tells me not to interrupt because will be busy and need to focus.-


At work, someone who sits behind me is clearly struggling for 3hours straight in front of the monitor, complaints that this work is so tedious, that there's gotta be easier way.

I didn't care that much at first not knowing the task exactly. I was annoyed at constant bickering about it however.

I was asked for help eventually, despite co-worker asking for a help, attitude of the co-worker was rather rude, although I will admit I could have been micromanaging-ish.

later I sat down for a minute researching if there are any easier way to do this. In about 10 minutes I came up with a solution that can be done in 2 minutes.
It was essentially done right before me on my screen.

I had to ask if this if my version is acceptable to who requested this task.

It was acceptable.

It was slightly in different format however,
3hours of work was just went to crap essentially, my co-worker didn't seem so happy about it, but was still working on that job was still in progress.

I was trying to ask what is the rest of the procedure would be then my co-worker was cutting me off in the middle of the sentence to ask me where I am up to, and I told my co-worker to not cut me off and let me talk because it's rude. 
Honestly this comes from the tension that was going on in prior as well as today's attitude of the co-worker despite asking for a help.

My co-worker walked out to let off the steam and came back and said, It's rude of me to take over the job and won't ask for a help again because I do this all the time.

Anyhow, while I do feel sorry and did apologise to my co-worker that I ended up taking over the job.

After that the co-worker brought up an analogy that it's like throwing a white paint over a painting that is still in progress and I could have been more collaborative by merging the my work and the work that was still in progress.


I had to disagree with that analogy strongly.

GF moved in with me, but her cats weren't able to. She couldn't bring her cats to family as the family actively said they would put the indoor raised cats outside. I texted my mom to try to see if she could hold them for a month. My mom cleaned out the ""animal"" room by moving the storage from that room to her room (she sleeps in a separate room from stepdad because stepdads dogs lay on his bed, her losing her room because of animals again is not lost on me). The cats end up there for almost 3 months.
Multiple times my mom has helped me and those connected to me. My first serious girlfriend lived there for a bit before I moved out entirely. When I needed money for groceries mom would spot me $30 or $50, when mom'd come by for a day to hang out she'd get me some groceries, she'd regularly help with rent for me and my sister, and I can't be more grateful for that support. It's more than most anyone deserves. 
Well, MIL offered GF a room at MILs new house a few states away. I was incredibly hesitant, knowing how overbearing MIL was to GF, but I still let GF know I would understand and support her decision if we made things long distance. Ultimately, GF chose to stay by me. MIL sweetened the deal with the room being rent-free, still declined, sweetened with land being put in GFs name so GF could build a house, still declined. Finally, I was invited and it was on the table for the both of us. 
I tell everyone that I will be moving with GF, and I have a going away party with friends from work, and a separate one with family. I get the equivalent of $1500 from my mom in the form of a PC on my way out and a statement from mom of ""If you ever need to come back, just give me a call.""
The second day we were here, after a 13-hour drive, FIL made a comment about rent, to which GF blew up as we were told it would be rent-free. Turns out, MIL didn't tell FIL we'd be rent-free.

We were talking about cosplays and she mentioned she wanted to try to do a Zelda one.

I realized after I said it that I might have been an ass, she has free will and can do what she wants with her time and money but it's just frustrating after 20 years of the same BS.


I've always understood gatekeeping to be more barring people from liking something or making others feel bad for being ""not enough of a fan"", which I don't feel like I did because I've been asking her to play or watch things for years, but I may be misinterpreting it.

Well, I‚Äôm 29 yo, I‚Äôm a doctor and I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 2 years now, we just got engaged and we are expecting a baby in November. 

My in-laws never really liked me because they‚Äôre Jehova‚Äôs Witnesses and my bf and I we are both agnostic. Since day 1 they tried to ‚Äúconvince me‚Äù to follow their religion but I made them clear I‚Äôm not religious at all. I‚Äôve noticed they didn‚Äôt liked me because of that since day 1, specially my father in law as he is somewhat a priest in the religion, which is called elder.because of that he beliefs he‚Äôs the owner of the only existent truth and all the other people are idiots. They and my bf don‚Äôt get along neither, they had been very ‚Äústrict‚Äù with him since he was a kid, and they had always criticized his lifestyle to the point they barely call him because he‚Äôs not Jehova Witness. They have been rude to me several times, laughing about my own beliefs (mostly scentific) and even about my appareance because I have tattoos (saying they mean Satan for no reason lol), but my bf has tattoos as well.

 I‚Äôve never been rude to them because at the end they‚Äôre my bf parents and I don‚Äôt want to make a conflict between them, but it has been hard for me because I have to even watch out what I post on social media because they will criticize. For example, my FIL had the nerve to tell my boyfriend that my pictures were p0rnographic because I was wearing a bikini in the beach, my bf told him he doesn‚Äôt think that way and he only replied ‚Äúok‚Äù. He also told my boyfriend that he doesn‚Äôt like what I post on MY social media (I like to post stories about what I think), because he doesn‚Äôt agree with my speech. Like WTF! 

Then, recently I‚Äôve been more sentimental than before because of the pregnancy. I‚Äôm 3 months now and they know, anyways they haven‚Äôt  asked not even ONCE about the baby or how my pregnancy is going. And I just found out that my FIL BLOCKED me from WhatsApp, because I can‚Äôt see his PP or status anymore and my boyfriend can see both from his phone. Why? I DON‚ÄôT KNOW. I haven‚Äôt event spoken to him at all. 

I went crazy, and started crying because all my previous in laws really liked and loved me. It is frustrating for me to be in this situation because my parents are the opposite with him. They love my bf, and they are the most lovable and supportive with me. 

I asked my bf to confront his father about this situation because I didn‚Äôt do anything to him. But he doesn‚Äôt want to say anything because he always avoid conflict with them, even when they‚Äôre very unfair and mean with him. He chat with him in their family group daily, and I think it‚Äôs unfair that he keeps talking with him like nothing is going on while he blocked me. 
I am DEMANDING my boyfriend to confront his dad this time about why they don‚Äôt want me if I have done nothing to them, but he keep refusing to do so. AITA for asking him to confront him and stop acting like nothing happened?

137,1ce7jmy,AITA for wanting to do chores on Sunday instead of Saturday? ,"My boyfriend and I live together. He's the super clean organized types while I'm a lot messier. On weekdays, we are too busy for any chores. We have someone cook for us every morning and he picks up any small errands that come up during the week because I'm working full time while he is preparing to start training in graphic designing.


The issue is that since I have WFH on most days of the week and he's also busy researching, finding out about institutes, etc, neither of us can clean up much. This causes the house to get VERY messy during the week and by the time Saturday rolls around, he is itching to clean up and organize because of how much the mess bothers him.


It bothers me too but honestly not as much as him. I still understand that he wants a cleaner space and I'm willing to help out. But I wanna keep these chores for Sunday, not Saturday.


My argument is that I spend 5 days a week working and I'm burnt out by Friday evening (it's very common to put in extra hours after the regular 9-6 hours plus I also try reading up/planning for my agency during my free time). I would like to keep Saturday to recover before we get to cleaning.


He argues that it's better to get everything out of the way on Saturday so that we have Sunday for relaxing and gear up for the next week.


It's Saturday and he's deep cleaning the house. He tried to get me involved with small tasks because I was exhausted but I just gave up. I don't know if I should just force myself to clean up on Saturday or what.

138,1ce7fvp,AITA for asking my roommate to keep her cat in the room while I'm home and clean up after she is outside,"So context, I live with 2 people. One (26F) who owned the car, who Ill name Martha. The other (25F) also rents part of the appartment, who for ease of reading I'll name Noodle. Both Noodle and I have allergies to cats, which I have the worst allergies but the initial agreement was that she would keep the cat in her room and as such get the bigger room. Both of our allergies were noted and voiced prior but I advised that as long as we stayed with the terms the little I'd get from cross over or the ventilation should be fine and worst comes to worse I'll just keep using an antihistamine to be safe. 

Some time passes and when the cat comes finally, I do let her have the cat out when I'm either not home or am keeping to myself and have my door shut, but ask when I am home or doing stuff in the common area the cat is kept in her room as I can get anywhere from the sniffles to being so congested breathing becomes hard depending on the dander and such. She for the most part listened but sometimes the cat would get out and I'd just move myself away from the cat or go to my room while Martha shepherds her cat back into her room. 

I don't really press it but I did ask her to perhaps get a baby gate to help stop the cat from escaping or be a little more attentive and not leave the door open when she is going back and forth if I am trying to cook (her bedroom door opens into out kitchen) 

Fast forward to this week where, as it is allergy season and the cat is entering shedding season, and naturally I've been having a huge issue with breathing that has affected my sleep. She has been more off the past bit as her boyfriend is out of town for work for a month and isn't handling it the best. As such she isn't staying on top of changing the litter, and I suspect also isn't on top of brushing the cat either. I asked her tonight if she wouldn't mind just keeping her sequestered more and being more on top of making sure she stays in her room until my allergies calm down a little bit. 

Martha's reaction was to say I was just saying it without saying it that I didn't want her to live here anymore, and that I am being unreasonable and not understanding. Following that up with saying ""it's great to see that no one cares about me and what I want"". I walked back the embargo on the cat coming out to become ""please keep the cat in while I'm home to be safe, and when you let her out to keep her from my door or clean up after if she does happen to go that way (it's a free animal, not like anyone can control it and make it only do exactly what they want, stuff happens)

After finding out about the pregnancy, my brother got a new house and she went to live with him and his little dog... right away she started fighting with him every day, because the dog wasn't used to the new house and I didn't know the right place to pee. She started freaking out so much that my brother decided to take his best friend to live in a kennel on our grandparents' farm. I was furious with this situation, I never thought he would be able to do something like this. For me, he abandoned his best friend, not only that, the place is dangerous for the dog in some many ways‚Ä¶ I ended up having to pay for the vaccines and I will also pay for my mother, who lives in another state, to take the dog with her.

143,1ce6ryi,AITA for thinking it's unfair I have to change my clothes just to accommodate my brothers friends?,"I (16M) have always been feminine growing up and people often mistake be for being a girl. I never had a problem with this and I didn't think my family did either until yesterday. My brother told me that when his friends come over I'm starting to make them uncomfortable because of the way I dress. I've known his friends for a while now and they have never said anything or made it known that I was making them uncomfortable before and I hardly talk to them anyway.

 Like if I see them I speak and all but I mostly be in my room. I told him that I don't see how I can make them uncomfortable if I'm not around them enough to do so. But he then told me that his friends started getting uncomfortable because I look ""too much like a girl"". I was confused by this as I didn't see how that was my problem as I'm literally barely around them but okay. 

He got our dad involved when I started ignoring him and our dad agreed with him and told me to try and dress less feminine when my brother's friends are around because he doesn't want them to be uncomfortable since they are guest. When I told him that I found it unfair he told me that he wasn't trying to be unfair but just want everyone to feel comfortable and welcomed and he's just trying to be considerate of everyone's feelings. 

Atp I just gave up because it was really no point in arguing. So the problem happened earlier today. My brother was gonna drive us home from school and two of his friends always ride with us since their house is on the way but im like since im making them uncomfortable I decided i was just gonna walk home and when I told my brother this he asked me if I was being serious and I told him that I was and that's exactly what I did. I made it home like 50ish minutes later. 

Our dad came home like 2 hours after I did and my brother told on me and my dad got mad. He literally started screaming at me and told me that what I did was dangerous blah blah blah. I told him that since my brother's friends are uncomfortable around me I was just trying to be considerate of everyone's feelings. He got upset that I said that and told me that I took his words out of context but I told him that I wasn't dressed very masculine so I'd be disobeying him.

 He told me that I knew it didn't apply for school and that I was being stupid by putting myself in danger to prove a point? I told him that if that's the case I can ride tje bus then cause I'm not riding home with people who are uncomfortable with me and since they have a problem with me I don't want to be around them at all. This just made my dad mad. He told me that he doesn't understand why I'm purposely being difficult when I'm normally reasonable. I'm just so upset rn, I don't see why I have to change the way I dress for people who aren't even living here. Am I really being unreasonable or..

For extra info, money has been tight due to a few concerns but I'm set now. 

The issues began a good month or two ago when the wifi bill was behind and her son /  my best friend (23 male) was short on work, I had said ""I would be able to go without it for a short period since a bit of my stuff goes off of wifi but let me see how I'm looking after my bills because I have a few coming up that I can't push off"" acknowledging that I understand what was going on and even promising to throw in some money for the bill,  just asking for her to inform me on when we'd be paying everything so I could budget around what I was caught on bill wise between my car payment, my insurance, and my phone bill on top of the rent and the ever high price of gasoline. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and the wifi is off and I had paid off the rent ($400), car payment ($428) and insurance ($250) totaling $1078 leaving me only enough for gas ($35 for a whole tank)  as I had been picking up the slack for my friend for the past few months as his department at our job had no work and was, in turn, causing him not to have anything to do. 

Upon being asked if I had any to chip in I said I didn't have anything as I had already put enough in for gas for the next two weeks because the maintenance department is still working to fix things in the building for when the busy season comes.

I can't connect for some reason"" to which I was immediately told, ""You said you could live without it so I paused you"".

 A few days ago, I was hauling my horse to my friend‚Äôs house to ride.

I slowed down but didn‚Äôt have anywhere to yield. I drive very carefully when my horse is in the trailer in general as he is very precious to me, but was going even slower to give this person time to make a decision or even just stop to evaluate the situation.

I shouted back that I have a trailer and couldn‚Äôt yield anywhere, but she kept driving and almost hit my trailer to get out of the ditch.
