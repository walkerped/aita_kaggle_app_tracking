0,1cf1hzh,AITA for avoiding my ex for 3 years ,"I (m25) dated my ex for 8 months. It began during Covid and I would be lying if being incredibly lonely during this time did not impact how many red flags I was willing to ignore. 
We met in my small university town which was a long way from my hometown (7 hours drive), this is relevant later. She was not a student but a local who was training in an apprenticeship for her job. 
During our time dating things became incredibly toxic and problematic. This began after I moved back to my hometown. She would demand that we FaceTimed every night before bed and when I said I was busy she would make me feel like a dick for not giving her my time. She obsessed over my attention as she had been very poorly treated by people in the past, in particular her family, for bing transgender. I believe I was her first real real relationship rather than a man simply fetishising her. 
As well as the demand of my time she would also frequently hint at needing money. I was working a minimum wage job fresh out of college at this point but I would usually succumb and lend her money. This became a real issue for me when I realised we had to break up as she still owed me around $1000 which was a lot at the time. However, she was beginning to have a very bad affect on my mental health and so I realised we had to break up. However before I could do it she broke up with me by text while I was at work one day. I was sent home as I didn’t really know what to do. But a week later she messaged me asking to get back together and foolishly I agreed. We got back together and broke up again 4/5 times over the next 5 months.
Until eventually keeping it all a secret (as my family hated her for breaking up with me) and her treatment of me I couldn’t do it anymore. So I told her we had to spend a week not talking for my mental well-being and if I felt better after that time I would text her. 
But I saw my chance and blocked her on everything. 
After that she went quiet for a while. But after a month or two she began what has now been a tirade of attempts to contact me for 3 years. 
1. She would withhold her number and call me 40-50 times usually around 12-2am
2. She would make new social media accounts to get in contact. 
3. She sent a cash app request for $69 asking to call her (this one did make me laugh)
4. She would take the train (7 hours) to where I lived and try to come to my work and home. 
5. Send me emails/use friends phones etc you get the idea. 

However I persisted in ignoring all this and refrain from being active online under my real name. But it still persists. 
I have recently moved countries and use a chat app that is only used in that country. And yesterday she somehow managed to find my account. 
However, this made me wonder if maybe I’m the asshole for never replying. And would this all go away if I’d just messaged back after a week saying things wouldn’t work out?

1,1cexcbe,AITA for making my son pay me back as a consequence?,"My (F42) son (M15) has recently become friends with a new group at school, and his relative level-headedness has disappeared in place of wanting to take part in all kinds of schenanigans. They have been relatively harmless until this point, but I have asked him on more than one occasion to be smart in his decision making.

Recently, my son saw a video online where someone put a cob of corn on a drill and tried to eat it while the drill was spinning. Obviously stupid at best and dangerous at worst. Unfortunately, my son's friends convinced him to do this and he ripped out two of his front teeth.

Of course I was worried, so I rushed him to our family dentist who was thankfully able to fit him in. My son was in a lot of pain, but the dentist was fantastic! Unfortunately we had to go down the route of dental implants.

After this very expensive exercise, I told my son that I expext him to pay me back. If an accident had happened or he needed dental work as part of his daily life, I would have no problem as this is my obligation as a parent. However, he chose to do something reckless and stupid, and now must face the consequences. What makes it worse is that he knew the risks - the man in the original video ripped his teeth out too!

My son says that this is incredibly unfair, he says that he was acting like any teenager would and I should be prepared for unexpected costs as the parent of a teenager. He says that I am putting him at a disadvantage because he will either have to get a job or dip into money from his grandparents. I told him it is high time he gets a job anyway to try and learn some sense of responsibility, but he says I am being too harsh.

2,1cewvnw,AITA for not letting my BF bring her dog with her to stay with me?,"So to give a little background I (29F) live alone in a one bedroom apartment. One of my BF's still lives with her mom and they are going to be put out of the place they live in soon.
My BF has 3 dogs that she takes care of (only one of them is actually hers) and she asked if she can stay with me if/when they get put out. Of course I told her yes I have no issue with her staying with me especially when the cost of living is so high these days
Anyway, while I told her that she can stay I also had to inform her that she couldn't bring her dog with her. She didn't outright get upset with me initially (she actually seemed fine with it), but (maybe it's just me) she keeps telling me how the stress of finding somewhere to live with her dog has been affecting her health and saying things like how I ""can't deal with her  bringing her dog over"".
Now don't get me wrong I love dogs just fine but there's a myriad of reasons as to why I don't currently have a pet.
1. My lease does not accommodate having a animal in my apartment so I will be at risk of being put out if the pet is discovered. 
2. Her dog is NOT house trained. I can't even list all of the past stories she's told me of her dog peeing and pooping on her clothes, bed, carpet, etc. I don't want to say I'm a neat freak but I like my place to be a certain way and I just know I wouldn't be able to deal with an animal who isn't trained.
3. I love her but she isn't exactly the cleanest person (trust me I've been to her place and was afraid to sit down) so that combined with her dog? It literally almost makes me hyperventilate at the thought of it.
4. Again I live in a one bedroom apartment. So accommodating an extra adult is already tough enough as it is w/o adding a pet on top of everything else.
Idk. I've just been feeling really guilty about the whole thing and wish I could be the type of person to just welcome them both with open arms but I've done that before (taken on more than I could handle with people staying with me) and it made me so stressed out.

3,1cewnaw,AITA for not wanting to respond to my dead dad’s girlfriend? ,"Starting off with sorry for the long post.

A few months ago we were notified that my dad had passed. 

We were not close, both him and my mom stepped out of my life when I was little, gave me to his parents, and gave up their parental rights. 
Over the years I saw him once in a while and once I had my own kids, he sent them birthday cards. He visited us once. 

Anyway, the reason I was contacted is because the police had me as next of kin, which once our family situation was explained, they changed this and I was taken off their notes as legally, I wasn’t. His parents were given all information and they had been working with coroner, funeral home, etc.

The problem is… it gets complex with his girlfriend. They were together over 2 decades and when we were notified he had passed, they gave me her number to call. I’d never talked to her and neither of us had each other’s numbers.

I called her, and I regret it. I just wanted to help. She had lived with him for 2 decades and suddenly he was gone. So I felt bad for her. She didn’t know what to do with his things, his house, car, job/coworkers so I was offering to help. We don’t live in the same state so it was all over the phone. 

It’s well over the scope of this post but his parents were named his beneficiary at work so they took care of that (he had no personal will) and them and her have a very bad relationship. Ultimately she wanted his parents to come up and help her and I knew they wouldn’t so I offered. 

In the state they lived in there’s very loose guidelines behind what a common law spouse is, what that person gets in case of death, etc. 

His parents signed off that he was not married on his death certificate, and evidently this causes issues on what his girlfriend now has claim to. She technically didn’t contribute to their income and she isn’t on the car or house. So her family got a lawyer. I immediately stepped out. Everyone started trying to make me mediator. 

Over the weeks I’ve gotten small rant updates from his parents that the coroner called because her lawyer called them, or the funeral home, or his job. From my very little understanding, to get his parents to amend the marital status. 

Last week his girlfriend started calling me again. I just had a baby 2 weeks ago, and we were released from the hospital this Tuesday. I just cant/don’t want to deal with it. I answered once last week and tried to explain this but she seemed to want to get straight to talking about all of that and then (thankfully) the call dropped. She called today again and I was nursing so it went to voicemail but I sent her a text asking how she was doing, no response. 

She left a voicemail talking about past family issues, how she didn’t know what was going on, asking what his parents had been telling me and essentially that our family is heartless. I’m just going to keep ignoring her? Or does that make me a huge asshole?

4,1cewkzy,AITA For Not Turning Down The Speakers/TV At Night When My Brother Asks,"My brother is an EXTREMELY loud snorer, and his bed is placed right next to my wall, so i can easily hear it. Earplugs don't work for me. They are unbearably uncomfortable in my ear(i can't even use earbuds for listening to music. i hate how they fee. i only listen through speakers), and i believe i ways take them off in my sleep at some point and throw them somewhere I guess. I've lost like 3 pairs at this point. But either way its so loud you can still he it faintly enough through earplugs

I have found that blasting brown noise, either through my speakers or tv really drowns the snoring out almost completely if i play it loud enough. Not every night, but some nights he wakes up from it and bangs on my door demanding i turn it off because he can't sleep through it.  
i have gotten to the point where I'm just pretending to still be asleep until he gives up when he's telling me to turn it off.

I understand he can't control snoring, but his snoring is literally nails on chalkboard for me. Having to listen to these EXCRUTIATINGLY loud snorting noises the entire night not irritates me.... it drives me absolutely mad(and daytime sometime. Days he's off of work he'll sleep from like 11PM-1PM)

5,1cewfzs,"AITA For planning to go to my best friend’s wedding without my (38M) partner (36f), when my ex will be there?","I separated from my ex-wife 4 years ago. I have since started dating my new partner of 2 years - we share a ton of interests, have great chemistry and deep conversations and intellectual kinship.    
  
However she is very insecure and jealous, and has intense emotional reactions when triggered.  At times we could barely go out in public without her becoming upset because she thought I was checking out another woman, even though I had no idea who she was talking about.    
  
This has improved over time, but there is still a cycle of positive connection followed by her being triggered by what to me feels like nothing.  
  
Her insecurity comes down to not feeling “seen” enough in my life.  When we started dating, we were both going through divorce; we’ve since become much more open with friends, hanging out and even traveling together, though we haven’t gone as far as meeting family.   
  
Now, my best friend’s wedding is coming up, and he has asked me to perform the ceremony.  We met in college and they live outside the US, so it will be a destination wedding, with many old friends in attendance -- and since both he and his fiance are friends with my ex, she is invited as well.   
  
They don't know my partner, and it's unlikely she could attend as she is not a US citizen and getting a visa would be difficult.  Even if she did go, I am afraid that she would have an anxiety attack/jealous blowup and impact the festivities.   
  
I have absolutely no romantic intentions with my ex, and my partner knows and believes this. To her, though, having me go to this event with my friends, with my ex there, and my partner being left out is unacceptably painful.  It is a symbol to her that what we have isn’t real, and that I will be seen there with my ex and all my friends, without my partner as part of my life.   
  
I empathize with the pain this can cause - at the same time, I don’t think that my friend’s wedding should be used as a vehicle to resolve our relationship issues.  It’s not about us; it’s about them.    
  
My partner says this will be too much for her to bear, and that she needs me to change my plans or that she needs to break up and start emotionally distancing herself.   
  
She has stated that her basic need is to feel important, and that if I change plans because of her feelings, this will help her feel more validated.  But isn’t this a bad precedent to set?  

If this is her boundary, I will have to respect it; but I can’t help feeling that this ultimatum is unfair.  
  
It seems my options are:   


a) Break up and go ahead with the wedding as planned

b) Not go to the wedding in order to avoid the trauma/drama, sacrificing an important life milestone with a good friend

c) Compromise by only going for the 2 days of the wedding and come back immediately after, and telling my friends it’s because my partner is uncomfortable.   (this will involve changing international travel plans and mean missing out on time with my friends.)

I (21 Fem) got into a fight with a friend whom I’ll call “Josh” (23 M) about three or four days ago.

He is so goddamn sexy, I wanna marry him so bad.” (Which was totally understandable since Aidan is quite handsome).  
Now, you see, Josh has an ongoing and obvious grudge with a gay male that I’ll refer to as “Cam” (23 M) he sees quite often at his favorite bar where we socialize with our friend circle. This causes him to be somewhat homophobic towards gay males, and he was just rambling on about how ”disgusting” gay men are yesterday and that they were “menaces to society”.  
So I replied, “Wait, I thought you thought that gay men were gross?” This caused him to go insanely mad and throw sexist phrases and terms at me, like, “You’re a woman, go back to the kitchen”. When he said the phrase aforementioned, I was just as enraged as he was.  
So I told him, “You’re a drunk bastard, go back to your drunk gangster clan, you unsightly dog!” When I said this, he got angrier about the fact that I pointed out that he was the only alcoholic in our friend circle of nine people.

9,1cevsga,AITA for how I took my brother's comments? (Petty argument),"My cousin is staying with me, I'm helping him try to salvage his life which has been homelessness, injuries, misfortune, and addiction for a while. He's weird about what he eats and drinks. He doesn't like to drink tap water. He also doesn't drive or have the ability to contribute much monetarily at this time, so in other words I buy the groceries. The budget is extremely tight (too tight), especially with all his dietary requirements. Anyway, I try to keep water jugs on hand so he can avoid using tap water like he wants to.

He ran out of water yesterday morning or so. Shortly after I had gone grocery shopping. I hadn't known he was so low on water when I went, and I work full time and I'm a parent. So I haven't made it back to the grocery store yet. 

I mention maybe swinging by the store to grab an ingredient for dinner. He's like ""oh and I'm out of water"" I was like ""cool, I can get some."" Then he goes ""yeah no offense but the tap water just tastes bad and I ran out of water so I just haven't drank any water in 2 days and I'm really thirsty.""

And honestly this irritated me. I took him saying this as some kind of implication that him not drinking water for 2 days was my fault. I thought, why is he guilt tripping me about this water when I just said I'd get some, and he is perfectly capable of drinking the unflouridated tap water if he's that thirsty? I responded kind of snippy, I was like ""yeah, that seems like a bad decision, I don't see how that's my fault.""

We got into an argument. He says he didn't mean it that way, and I believe him. But he didn't understand how I could possibly take it that way, and that's been my sticking point. I'm willing to adjust to the knowledge that he wasn't trying to guilt trip me. But the fact that I took it that way seems reasonable. Why else would he proceed to complain at me about how thirsty he was?

But...I'm trying to improve my trauma responses. Maybe that really is a huge leap to make? Does his comment seem like a reasonable thing people say to make conversation?

hi! i (19F) am in a relationship with a man (19M) 😊 we’ve been really chill and alright but lately things have been rocky and i need an opinion. me and him are good at communicating and have been together for a few months! however the issue kinda started when he started blowing me off every time i asked to hang out or go out together. it was always a different reason like work needed him that day, or his mum needed him to do housework, and i am always understanding because i know life is busy. but the problem started when i one day found out he lied about where he was. he said he’d be at his grandparents house but i was out with some of my girlfriends at the mall and i see him there?? he was only there with his boys but i was really confused why he lied about where he’d be, especially when i was okay — encouraging even — of going to his grandparents place. i asked him later and he said it was a last minute change of plans and i shrugged it off. but this became a slight habit and happened a few more times. 

so one day i used his find my location and tracked him to a place and it happened to be a different place than what he told me. i basically ended up crying and making a scene and told him i didn’t want him to hang out with these guys if they’re going to lead him to lie to me. he said i can’t tell him who he can and can’t be friends with and now i refuse to talk to him till he apologizes and stops hanging out with them. my friends say that was immature and controlling of me but im just mad at the fact he’s so comfortable lying to me.

Earlier last month I put our home up for sale on websites just to help my grandparents out. I could get them a small affordable apartment, and a home for my family and I.

15,1ceu9wq,WIBTA if I put a lien against my parents' house and sued them for my college tuition?,"I, 17F, am graduating high school next month and am set to attend my first-choice college with a partial scholarship in the fall. It's an instate school about an hour away, and because of my dual enrollment credits, I should only be 5 semesters from finishing my bachelor's degree and then going for the master's degree I need for the career I want.

Five years ago my Mamaw, (mom's mom) died, leaving behind a college fund for me and my siblings, Kyle (M25) and Kelsey (F22). Mom's Aunt Teresa was supposed to oversee it, but she died in 2020, and somehow my parents wound up in charge. I don't know all the details because I was 12 when Mamaw died and 14 when Aunt Teresa died. I'm not even sure exactly how it was structured or how much there was, except that it was supposed to be enough to cover a significant amount of our expenses if not everything.

Kelsey is a fine arts major and her first year of college was derailed by lockdowns, and she wound up losing an entire year. She was supposed to go back for her final year next fall just as I am starting college, but last night at our Grandpa's birthday dinner (Dad's dad) she announced that she had been invited to participate in a Junior Artist in Residence study program and was deferring her last year of college. Everyone congratulated her and my grandparents asked about what sort of stipend she was getting. She said there wasn't one, but Mamaw's money would cover her living expenses.

My uncle said that between me starting college and them covering that, the fund would be empty soon, and would her share be enough to pay for her final year after? That's when my dad said that since I had scholarships and my sister needed it more, I wouldn't be getting any of the money Mamaw left for us. Everyone was shocked and started asking questions, but my parents insisted that it was important to support my sister's artistic goals ""the way we never were"", and that I'd be fine.

When my grandparents argued with them, Mom said I could take out loans for what my scholarship didn't cover and live at home to save money. I was in tears and my sister was upset that people weren't happier for her. When my uncle asked if there was even going to be money left for my sister to go back and graduate, my parents said they would take out a loan against the house to cover it.

Everyone got in a huge argument and my parents and sister left. My grandparents, uncle, and aunt got to talking and my uncle, who is a lawyer, says he's going to look into it and that we may have to sue them for my share of the college money because he believes they mismanaged it. My grandparents are worried about them mortgaging the house and losing it, and suggested we take out a lien against the house for my tuition money so they can't use it to get a loan to pay for my sister's expenses.

WIBTA if I sued my parents for my college tuition and put a lien against their house like my grandparents suggested?

Update: Thank you all for the advice. I know you can't just ""put a lien"" against the house, but my uncle and grandparents are talking about suing for the money and since my parents won't have it, putting a lien against the house. They want to move quick before my parents can ""do any other stupid crap"" as my Grandpa put it. We all know if my parents spent the money, there is no way they will be able to pay it back, neither will my sister, and Grandma basically told me, ""but at least they won't be able to lose the house"". My parents inheriting the house from Mamaw was the only way they could afford a home, they have never been good with money, so growing up my grandparents covered a lot of their bills so we could have groceries and that is probably why Mamaw left Aunt Teresa in charge of it. They are worried what will happen to my parents if they do take out a loan on the house because none of us believe they would be able to pay it back.    
  
My uncle is going to talk to his law partner about taking the case, but most importantly, I was able to call Kyle and since he was an adult when Mamaw died he actually has a copy of the will somewhere that he says he'll find and send to us, but he knew how much was in the account and where it came from. According to Kyle there was a 300,000 life insurance policy from when PopPop, my maternal grandfather, died, and Mamaw saved it for us to use for college. He's not sure how it was structured exactly, except he is pissed because his college didn't cost very much and what wasn't used was supposed to be distributed when we all graduated or turned 25, whichever happened first.  So they stole not only from me but from him too. I knew my sisters school was expensive, it's a private college, but I guess I assumed she was using loans or a scholarship or something? I never really thought about how they were affording her college, I just focused on doing well and getting as many dual enrollment credits as my school would allow so I wouldn't have to spend as much time or money when I graduated and went to college. When he told me I was in tears because 100K would more than cover my bachelors degree and probably my masters degree too. What I want to do (meteorology) really requires a masters or even a doctorate if you want to do any of the really interesting stuff. 

My parents were mad at me when I went home last night like I had caused the fight, so I just went to bed then went to work this morning, and am just sort of drained or like I got hit by a truck. My best friend says I didn't do anything wrong and just sort of got sucked into everyone else's drama and scheming, which seems pretty accurate. Even more stupid is that my grandparents told me that because they knew I had a ""decent amount"" from Mamaw,  they only saved for my aunts kids college funds, so they feel bad too, and Grandpa's birthday dinner got ruined. I got him some cheesecake from my work and I'm going to take it over to him when they get back from church tonight.   
  
Either way I got into my first choice college and am going to go, even if I have to sell blood or take out loans, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I'm trying really hard not to let this affect me too much because I still have final exams coming up and even though my grades are good I don't want to let this screw up anything else since some of my scholarships are dependent on my grades. My brother suggested in the meanwhile that I can file paperwork for my fafsa to not have my parents income counted, just my own, so I might be able to qualify for more aid, so I'm going to talk to my guidance counselor tomorrow about that.

My grandparents, uncle, and aunt got to talking and my uncle, who is a lawyer, says he's going to look into it and that we may have to sue them for my share of the college money because he believes they mismanaged it. My grandparents are worried about them mortgaging the house and losing it, and suggested we take out a lien against the house for my tuition money so they can't use it to get a loan to pay for my sister's expenses.

WIBTA if I sued my parents for my college tuition and put a lien against their house like my grandparents suggested?

Update: Thank you all for the advice. I know you can't just ""put a lien"" against the house, but my uncle and grandparents are talking about suing for the money and since my parents won't have it, putting a lien against the house. They want to move quick before my parents can ""do any other stupid crap"" as my Grandpa put it. We all know if my parents spent the money, there is no way they will be able to pay it back, neither will my sister, and Grandma basically told me, ""but at least they won't be able to lose the house"". My parents inheriting the house from Mamaw was the only way they could afford a home, they have never been good with money, so growing up my grandparents covered a lot of their bills so we could have groceries and that is probably why Mamaw left Aunt Teresa in charge of it. They are worried what will happen to my parents if they do take out a loan on the house because none of us believe they would be able to pay it back.    
  
My uncle is going to talk to his law partner about taking the case, but most importantly, I was able to call Kyle and since he was an adult when Mamaw died he actually has a copy of the will somewhere that he says he'll find and send to us, but he knew how much was in the account and where it came from. According to Kyle there was a 300,000 life insurance policy from when PopPop, my maternal grandfather, died, and Mamaw saved it for us to use for college. He's not sure how it was structured exactly, except he is pissed because his college didn't cost very much and what wasn't used was supposed to be distributed when we all graduated or turned 25, whichever happened first.  So they stole not only from me but from him too. I knew my sisters school was expensive, it's a private college, but I guess I assumed she was using loans or a scholarship or something? I never really thought about how they were affording her college, I just focused on doing well and getting as many dual enrollment credits as my school would allow so I wouldn't have to spend as much time or money when I graduated and went to college. When he told me I was in tears because 100K would more than cover my bachelors degree and probably my masters degree too. What I want to do (meteorology) really requires a masters or even a doctorate if you want to do any of the really interesting stuff. 

My parents were mad at me when I went home last night like I had caused the fight, so I just went to bed then went to work this morning, and am just sort of drained or like I got hit by a truck. My best friend says I didn't do anything wrong and just sort of got sucked into everyone else's drama and scheming, which seems pretty accurate. Even more stupid is that my grandparents told me that because they knew I had a ""decent amount"" from Mamaw,  they only saved for my aunts kids college funds, so they feel bad too, and Grandpa's birthday dinner got ruined. I got him some cheesecake from my work and I'm going to take it over to him when they get back from church tonight.   
  
Either way I got into my first choice college and am going to go, even if I have to sell blood or take out loans, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I'm trying really hard not to let this affect me too much because I still have final exams coming up and even though my grades are good I don't want to let this screw up anything else since some of my scholarships are dependent on my grades. My brother suggested in the meanwhile that I can file paperwork for my fafsa to not have my parents income counted, just my own, so I might be able to qualify for more aid, so I'm going to talk to my guidance counselor tomorrow about that.

A little background information my current boyfriend and I have been on again/ off again since August of 2021, he is 34 and I am 24. I have a full time job and recently bought a house in October of 2023. He made a lot of bad choices in his past, so is still in the process of getting his bachelors degree (he graduates in May 2024) and then has been accepted to a pharmacy graduate program starting August 2024 which is 2.5 hours away from where I bought my house(no I’m not moving with him). My boyfriend stays at my house typically Friday, Saturday and Sunday night and maybe one or two week day nights, so he’s here fairly often. If he’s not here, he lives with his dad full time. My boyfriend does not pay any bills at my house nor his dad’s house and pays only for his car payment and car insurance (he works part time and maybe makes $14 an hour). So when he comes over he walks the dog and may cook us dinner. I told him he doesn’t help make life easier one night after a 70 hour work week I had. I mentioned to him that he never cleans, vacuums the house, mop the floors, wipe the kitchen counters down, or help clean the bathrooms. He told me I should have to tell him what to do but he doesn’t mind help. He explained he doesn’t notice when things are dirty around the house but I do because of my OCD. He explained I should not expect him to clean the house and it was unfair for me to expect him to take initiative and clean the house without being told what to do.  He explained after a long day at work he doesn’t think about coming home to do additional chores at the house. Lastly, he said he unloads and loads the dishwasher which was “helping”. I told him he is an adult and should be able to notice when the house needs to be vacuumed or counters need to be wiped down and it would help me a lot. I explained to him I do his laundry on a regular basis to help him out but he doesn't do much to make life easier for me. After about 5 minutes of this conversation he said his heart was “pounding out of his chest” and needed some space, grabbed his beer and walked out to my living room and that’s basically where the conversation ended. Sooo am i the asshole for expecting my boyfriend to help around the house without being told exactly what to do?

  
update: we were finally able to talk it out. He explaiend he does not feel like either of us should have to “clean after a long day at work”. He explained he does not want a list to be made up for him as he feels like “I want my cake and eat it too”, he also said explained he would be willing to clean “on the weekend one day a week when we both can equally clean together so it seems equal” meaning we will make a list of everything that needs to be done such as mopping, sweeping, dusting etc. and split it in half so we’re both cleaning at the same time and this seems more equal and fair to him. He explained making a list for him to do is infantilizing him and treating him like a child. I told him we could make a list and both throughout the week mark off what gets done and he does not like this idea. He typically works weekends as a pharmacy tech, and I work M-F as a CPS investigator, with occasional overtime on the weekends. He said I make him feel like my job is harder than his job and all I do is “sit on my ass and if I’m not on a case I’m driving in a car or doing paperwork at a computer, so the majority of the time I’m sitting”; so him being on hit feet all day in the pharmacy is exhausting and he doesn’t think after a day at the pharmacy he should be required to come home and do chores.

Then they kept going on about how I'm an a hole for not supporting a local artist and that I'm ruining their business before I blocked them. 

I just think it's kinda scummy to claim it's 100% original art work when it's clearly not and is just up cycled repainted dollar store art. I'd be mad if I spent that much money thinking it's an original piece only to find out it's just from the dollar store and they scribble some paint on it. 
  
And it's not like the creative stuff that's popular online where the artist buys an old thrift store painting and adds a pop culture character to it and resells because at least you know that they up cycled it and don't claim it's all their original art. 
 
Am I wrong? Is it really considered 100% original art work? I'm autistic so I usually have trouble with people taking what Ive said as something other than how I've ment it so I'm not sure if it's something to do with that.

We spent over a year planning details and searching for the exact colours we wanted everything to be. My step-sister (30) “Stacy” got engaged late last year, and has been planning and coordinating a large scale wedding since then. 

During this time she made several extremely similar arrangements to my wedding, and has been what I would call a bridezilla. This has resulted in me calling her spoiled. 

For context some of the decisions Stacy has made since becoming engaged;

1. The wedding is taking place at our parents house (who are footing a lot of the bill) in the woods, and she has made our parents curate and grow the flowers for her wedding. These flowers are the same types of flowers that I had hand picked and tied into bouquets for my wedding, plus several more expensive types. Our wedding was also in the woods.

2. My wife and I both wore green, the wedding party and our son all wore royal blue. My sister has decided the men are all wearing royal blue, and the women are wearing green. I told Stacy I was going to wear a blue suit (not royal). This sparked a huge tantrum in which she stated that no family member can wear any blue or green, as none of us are in the bridal party. 

3. My sister and I had discussed that I was eloping, but would be planning a vow renewal for as soon as we could afford to host a “big wedding”. One of the things I had made very clear was that I loved the song Tell me something good, and would be using it for our entrance song to the party for the vow renewal, and it was the song that played while we toasted did our cake at our elopement. Stacy, upon starting to plan her wedding said it would be their entrance song for their party, and that I “should have saved and had a big wedding first”

4. While I don’t believe that family HAS to be involved in your wedding, our family is extremely close. Stacy asked me to be the DJ and my father to walk her down the aisle. I was very excited for this task and immediately started making a playlist, and writing an introduction for the newlyweds. Months after this, I presented the final products to her and was told I wouldn’t be using either of those, as our parents friend would be doing intros and all I was to do was press play on an add free radio station. I expressed my frustration to her about this, and was called an asshole. 

4.5 Our other sister (Tracy) was not asked to do anything to help. Tracy expressed to our mother that this upset her, and she must have spoken to Stacy. A few days later Stacy had the family together on facetime and was going on about how she had an extremely important question for Tracy and that it was a big deal. She proceeded to ask Tracy to be the one to fix her train for her, before walking down the aisle.

I immediately turned around and yelled back “I already cancelled the ikea order already so the pending charge will be refunded! And if it isn’t, you call them with proof the order was cancelled and they fix it!” I admit, I was condescending in that response. Afterwards I walked away from her and placed the order on my own.

I couldn’t even believe it. Left us high and dry. We did get an Uber; but I am still upset at him. Is it really wrong to expect a ride from your bf?",1.0,1.055355,1,1

No problem, so I get my food and I'm ready to EAT when I get home. Upon first sight, my wife immediately started asking for some, which annoyed me it was whatever. I gave her a few bites, and gave myself a few bites before heading to shower (I know its weird to have some food *then* shower, but I didn't finish it, so it's okay).

10 minutes later, by the time I'm back to the dinner table, the container is basically fucking ravaged.

After this convo occurred, all of a sudden he’s “ill and can’t work” and essentially locked himself in his room and refused to function. Ruined Thanksgiving, Christmas and a milestone birthday for my partner. Eventually took him to hospital to be told he’s fine and even the nurse had some words for him. 

Fast forward to last week. I ask him if he’s made any strides in reaching out to past landlords/realtor to potentially move states and he finally does so. Finds something affordable, in town, with a landlord he really liked. I’m pulling money out of MY RETIREMENT to help him with move in cost/transfer of bills. Ever since we talked about he’s been behaving the same way he did when we previously discussed his moving. Essentially mind melding himself into appearing sick even though he’s fine. 

I became upset and in the moment told him he needs to get his shit together or I’d be forced into looking into some sort of mental healthcare institution since he clearly has some problems. I feel bad for what I said but I do mean it.

26,1cfkgik,"WIBTA for ""one upping"" my dad by getting my sister another birthday cake?","I (17f) have an older sister (21f) who had a birthday recently. She’s not big on celebrating it due to an event that occurred when she was a kid on that same day, and it’s kind of been tainted for her ever since i think. 

Last year was the first time I can remember her asking for anything for her birthday in years, and literally all she said she wanted was a small heart shaped chocolate cake with lavender colored frosting and purple flowers on it.

Our dad got her an ice cream cake instead and ended up forgetting to bring it into the house so it melted into a pile of mush. He was apologetic about it, and she said it was fine, but I could tell that she was disappointed and I felt bad that she didn’t get the one thing she asked for.

She didn't ask again for anything this year, but I decided that I wanted her to have the cake she asked for last year but didn’t get. I talked to our dad about getting her a cake again, specifically the one she’d wanted, and he agreed to order it so I figured it was a done deal. 

Well on the night before her birthday my dad pulled out a plain white sheet cake (the discounted undecorated kind) he bought from the grocery store. Which obviously it wasn’t my birthday, and she said that she was fine with the sheet cake, but I’m kind of irritated since my dad agreed with me when I said we should get her the cake she had wanted before. I mentioned it to him but he said it was just a cake, and she was fine with the one he got her.

I snooped through her social media and there’s this local bakery she follows that makes cakes similar to the one she was asking for. I called and got a quote for a cake, and they said they could have it ready within a few days.

I don’t want to like one up my dad by getting my sister this cake, and I know that she said she was happy with the cake she got, but I just want her to have the thing she asked for and I feel like he dropped the ball with this.

I also feel like I’m kind of overthinking this but I don’t want my dad to feel like I’m slighting him or something either. Idk i just wanna know if it would be a jerk move to get a cake for my sister.

He’s had a couple other girlfriends since then and is still with one of them currently, but he still did go to most of my appointments with me. 

2 days ago when I went into labor I called him, he came to pick me up to bring me to the hospital and he had his entire TV and playstation in the backseat, with no car seat for the baby. I told him he is not bringing that to the hospital and he told me if I want him to be there for our son’s birth he needs something to do to pass the time. We argued about it almost the entire ride to the hospital, but he ended up not bringing it in. 

I was only in labor for about 2 hours before I gave birth, he was there the entire time.

I told him while they’re here visiting for him to go bring his TV back home and install the car seat so when they discharge us we will be all set. After a few hours my family leaves, and I text him to tell him he is welcome to come back if he would like. 

Around 20 minutes later he’s walking back into my room, carrying his TV. We start arguing about how I already told him he is not having that in my room and he starts yelling at me saying that I don’t make the rules and that I should be grateful that he wants to be there for our son but instead I’m trying to make him miserable. I told him he can either bring the TV back to his car or he can leave, he said he has a right to spend time with his son. 

I called my nurse into the room and told her I want him to leave, so they ended up kicking him out. He yelled at me the entire time he was leaving saying that I’m kicking him out of his son’s life and that he will be going to court for custody.

We were going to do it on her actual birthday, which was a Monday. I thought this was a super fun idea and took that day off of work right away. I have a pretty bad memory so I take care to put events in my calendar so I don’t forget otherwise it’ll disappear from my mind.

I recently broke up with my ex a couple months ago, we’ll call him Brad. We were no contact for a while so we could both try to move on. I’ve really missed having him in my life tho and honestly really wished we could be friends again. Recently he reached out and asked if we could meet up in a public place just to talk amicably and test the waters to see if a friendship would be possible for us. So we made plans for us to meet up the Sunday before my sister’s birthday lake trip. 

A couple of days before I was supposed to meet up with him, my mom told me that the lake trip was on Sunday and it always had been. I told her I didn’t know that the plan had changed and she told me that we had discussed it already. She does this a lot where she says that we’ve talked about something several times but I don’t remember her ever saying that. I have a bad memory, but if she had changed the day and told me I would have put it in my calendar for this exact reason. 

My other sister had a church activity on Sunday at 6:30, so we would have had to be home by 6 pm. So I said it’s fine and asked Brad if we could push back our meetup a few hours. While we were at the lake, however, she told my mom that she didn’t want to go to the church activity and my mom said she didn’t have to. My mom was aware that I was still planning on meeting up with Brad once we were home. I can tell she didn’t want me to tho because she never really liked that I was with him in the first place. I also had a bad feeling before we left for the lake that we definitely wouldn’t be home in time for me to honor my commitment to meeting up with Brad.

Their sons are the same age as our youngest and she has no desire to play with them.

31,1cfjr00,AITA for feeling conflicted about lending my car to my roommate for his sister's wedding?,"TL;DR: I refused to give my roommate my car to get to his sister's wedding because he always returns it with dents and scratches, and now he won't be able to arrange for transportation.

Hey everyone, I'm facing a moral dilemma regarding my roommate, Mark (26M), and I could really use some outside perspective.



About two weeks ago, Mark asked if he could borrow my car for his sister's wedding, which is happening out of town. Initially, I agreed because I understand how important this event is for him and his family.



However, here's where things get complex: I've let Mark borrow my car in the past, and it's come back with scratches, dings, and once even a dent! Despite this, I've always covered the repair costs and tried to be understanding.



Adding to my dilemma, last weekend, I lent him the car for another trip, and it came back with more scratches and a dent. This made me really anxious about lending it to him again for such an important event.



I've been torn between wanting to help Mark out for his sister's wedding and protecting my car, which has been damaged multiple times before. I know he needs the car for the wedding, but I also feel like I'm being taken advantage of.



I hesitated to retract my offer because I didn't want to let him down, but as the wedding draws closer, my anxiety about my car's condition grows stronger.



Mark got upset when I brought up my concerns, accusing me of going back on my word and letting him down when he needed help the most. Now, he's giving me the silent treatment, and I can't help but feel guilty.



Am I the asshole for feeling conflicted about lending him my car, or is it understandable given the circumstances?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-28,"AITA for feeling conflicted about lending my car to my roommate for his sister's wedding?

32,1cfjmzm,AITA - I'm going to Chicago... He's not,"
Ok, so I'll make this short and sweet...

I was offered an opportunity to go to Chicago for a work event. I'd never been to Chicago, so thought I would spend a few days there.

That night, I asked the husband at dinner out if he wanted to come with me (after the work summit was done). He shook his head and said ""It's not my thing"". ""Ok"", I said.

So I proceeded to plan my trip. I was telling him about all the stuff I was planning - museum visits during the day, the CAC boat and a visit to a jazz club (he's not a jazz fan) as well as a couple of restaurants I'd like to try.

Then I went looking for places around the city to rent. I found an AirBnB and glad I found what I did and where I did for the price as close to the city as I did. Only hours after he noticed me looking for the perfect place as he thought he could find a cheaper place for me to stay. I did find something worthwhile and proceeded to book.

The AirBnb came with a contract that needed to be signed in order to book the place. I booked it for one person and thought that was it.

Well, here we are today and talking about a potential visitor coming (a very good friend of his). I suggested a possibility that she could visit (she needs to get away) while I'm in Chicago.

He got bullshit at me asking why I booked it. I told him I thought we had this settled the first night at the restaurant. He said ""I didn't say 'No'"".

Well, not specifically but you did shake your head and say ""It's not my thing"".

And where was he when I was telling him specifically (more than once) of things I""m doing....going to museums and jazz clubs - two things he specifically did not have an interest in.

AITA here?

33,1cfjkx5,AITA for calling my partner's co-worker pushy and telling her to leave?,"My (FTM19) partner, Moz (M23) works at some revenue office. It isn't his scene at all, but the pay is a bit more than the minimum wage we got by on before. 

Ever since he started, Moz has always been lamenting to me about how miserable he is at his job, its a nightly occurrence. At first, I chalked it up to him just being his usual self, he's always very sarcastic and cynical, but I think he genuinely does hate it there. According to him, his co-workers are always ready to take the piss out of him, they're all friends with each other and he's not included in whatever they all have going on. They make fun of him because he is painfully shy, bit of a smart arse, he dresses pretty 70s. He's not really a lad's lad, he's too sensitive for that type of thing.

A new woman started working in their section of the office recently, Libbie (F28). Moz has said a few times that she's basically a Lad stuck in an attractive woman's body, she's identical in personality and hobbies to their other co workers, only difference being that she actually tries to befriend my partner. I thought originally that that'd be a positive, but he despairs. Apparently she's very in your face and overwhelming to be around, she doesn't get the hint that he doesn't want to be friends or even acquainted with her. She's tried a few times to invite him out to places with her, or to parties but Moz has always declined.

There was some kind of work dinner going on last week and after much cajoling from me, Moz decided to go. Libbie was insistent on Moz walking her home and when he refused she offered to spilt the taxi fare with him, though she ended up coming to our place rather than her own home.

I was surprised to see them, it was almost 9pm, I looked a huge mess because I'm 7 months pregnant and sick and the flat was in a bit of a state. I could just tell that Moz was feeling awful and uncomfortable, he tends to practically chew his lip off and blushes. 

Libbie tried to be nice and causal but that was beyond her, she was loud and  insistent on being given an apartment tour and was just being super patronising in how she spoke to me, she acted as if she was in her own apartment. I asked her if she didn't think she was being pushy by practically forcing herself into being invited over? To which she called me a rude little guy, and started joking around with Moz about me practically being an impertinent kid and stuff. I ended up telling her to leave, that she wasn't welcome here at all. She told me that I was acting like a dick.

The next morning, Moz and I talked about it and he said that while she shouldn't have come over, she was tipsy and that he's surprised I was angry about the jokes since I make similar ones myself.

35,1cfjdcq,AITA for telling my wife I don't like my wedding bands ,"15 years ago, in total spur of the moment, my partner asked me to marry her. A month or so later, she asked again, on bended knee and with a ring. I said yes (obviously) and proceeded to hint at the style of rings that I liked. I circled rings in magazines and conveniently left them around the house or gushed over rings I'd see on TV etc.  The one thing I had asked or hinted at while we were dating was no diamond rings.  I would prefer a Sapphire. 
Christmas Eve 2008, on a starry she asked. To my utter surprise, it was NOT the style I expected. Mind you, it's beautiful, with a Sapphire center, with diamonds and sapphires encircling the band, gorgeous. 
 However, I'm a really simple girl, and the ring is way more flashy with thick bands and large stones. Opposite my style and personality.  

I didn't have the heart to tell her at the time I didn't like it and have chosen to wear it for the past 15 years. 
In the past few years,  I've made comments to change my wedding bands into more of a style. better suited to me. 
I've explained it doesn't really suit my style, and if I'm the one wearing it, it should be what I like.

When I apologized for the joke he told me the grow a spine and leaves. The costumer next to me simply sighed and told me not to worry about it. 

So I go and report it to my manager and she said “the joke is innocent on its own, you should leave it to yourself, but you did the right thing by not fighting him”. Now something about me, when you start snapping at me, I’m going to snap back, but I couldn’t because I’d lose my job. If this happened while I was off shift, it would’ve been a different story.

45,1cfibmh,AITA for pushing financial literacy on a friend after she called me cheap?,"I’ve (F 28) had a friend since college. I am a high earner in a HCOL city. She is in the same city and makes around half of what I make. We both grew up middle class but as the relatively poor kids at schools where the rich sent their kids. Ever since I moved to her city she has called me cheap, because I do things like make us bus instead of Uber and say no to buying drinks at clubs. Other than that, she has been a great friend.

She was unemployed a few months between jobs and I noticed her relationship with money start shifting. She started wanting men to give her a “princess treatment” and on LNY she spent her red envelopes on clothes as soon as she got them. At the time I did say it would be financially wiser to save them. She was embarrassed to have to start financially depending on her parents again. She normally is super independent.

Things came to a head for her birthday. A few weeks before she texted me asking for a gift that’s over $100. It’s from a brand that’s very hyped but poor quality (both of us have bought things from them before), and the item isn’t on sale. I thought this was delusional and said nothing. A week later she asked for something else that was $85, and since Sephora was about to have its insider sale and I forgot her gift last year I bought it feeling like it was a good purchase.

We met up for a free corporate lunch days before her birthday as we’d be in different cities the actual day. She said every time I do/say something cheap it makes her hate me a little.

When we got back, to celebrate a new job, she started doing a few things I was concerned was living beyond her means, like buying expensive clothes and ordering delivery (normally fine, but after a few months of unemployment seemed like a lot). After years of being called cheap, I called her spending financially unwise and asked if was still able to return what she had bought.

It escalated today when she sent me a book with a titled, “Why We Hate Cheap Things.” I wrote back “At least my ability to retire won’t be dependent on me marrying a rich man.” She wrote back she’s her own sugar daddy and I was putting her down. To her credit, before she was unemployed she was super independent.

I decided to be thoughtful about it and explain I don’t mean to put her down, but I am concerned about her financial literacy. I explained to her I know we do things differently. I invest or save half of what I make, and offered to share with her some resources that helped me gain financial literacy to take money being fun to a tool. I know she makes less than me, but all income levels can benefit from having more financial literacy.

She wrote back saying I was judging her lifestyle and she rather live in the moment because the future is not guaranteed. She pointed out health is more important than money, which she has a point, I’ve skipped Drs appointments I could afford because they are $500 an appointment with insurance.

I didn't tell my dad because he's been volunteering to be a chaperone on every field trip I had this year. Which have been 2. I was already on edge when he started coming but the last time he chaperoned  he over heard a conversation I had on the bus that he WASN'T supposed to hear as hes NOT even supposed to come. He put me in an uncomfortable situation because he forced me to talk about it. I cried so much that day. 

That's when I knew he should NEVER be a  chaperone again. However, my brother is stupid and let it slip about my field trip despite me literally telling him that I didn't want my dad to come. I'm positive he did that just to be to hateful because he started laughing about it. My dad was mad and accused me of lying to him which was not true I just didn't tell him. We got into an argument because I told him that I already told my teacher that he'll be busy that day and I already turned in my permission slip. This made him more upset because I forged his signature and he told me that he was gonna call the school and let them know he was available.

I told my dad that If he chaperones I won't go because I'm going to get AWAY from him not to stay close to him 24/7. He got madder and told me that I was going whether I like it or not and I should be grateful I'm not punished. I told my dad that forcing me to go is just as bad as a punishment because I'm tired of my friends making fun of me and making comments about him. He did not care and basically told me to ignore them.

I don't understand why he does this to me. Like I just want to be myself and I can't do that when I'm around him everyday. I told my dad that I'll go but it just proves to me how little he cares about my well-being. He got upset with me and started telling me that it wasn't true and he just wants to spend time with me.

 I don't want to spend time with him. It's embarrassing. Like once a field trip okay. But every field trip is just no. Like I don't mind spending time with my dad. I love him.

48,1cfi018,AITA for lying to my friend's face in front of our boss?,"I (32F) and my friend Sarah (34F) work in a retail establishment. We both signed up to work inventory. For reference we have a team come in and scan inventory and we double count and in some sections our own staff will do their own scanning to compare accuracy.

This year I got put up front to count with my friend to do barcode look ups as we are the only 2 who can do it. We both had to do some renewal training so when she left I double counted what was done up front. I noticed one had a missing row of 3 items but while multi tasking I got distracted and had not flagged someone to fix this. I had signed off on the other lines tallied on the ticket for that section as they were correct though. 

We also had our own staff scan this section and they had done it correctly so there was a discrepancy.

Our boss came up looking into the discrepancy saying whoever is counting up here isn't even f-ing counting and everything is f-ing wrong in a rage. When I asked him what was wrong he ignored me and refused to tell me. He just kept lashing out. For context this aggressive behavior is quite common in general and worse when interacting with me because he does not like me on a personal level and tends to make things personal rather than professional which is well known and usually leads to disrespectful conversations and treatment such as this.

So cue my friend who asks if I signed off on the ticket in front of this boss. Had my boss politely asked me if I had done it and explained the discrepancy I would have gladly responded yes and that a row of 3 items was not accounted for and one 1 that would not scan adding up to the missing 4 I just had not flagged anyone down yet. Instead I said I don't know who did it and walked away as I was no longer going to tolerate the verbal abuse. Eventually the situation was resolved and everything was accounted for on their end.

Later on I told Sarah I did sign off on the ticket and lied which is when I found out she told our boss that she thought I made the mistake which is what caused the escalation and aggression of the situation in the first place. She was upset I had not said it was me. I explained to her that it wasn't anything against her I just would not tolerate that level of disrespect and there was no another option where it wouldn't have gotten worse so I chose to remove myself from the situation. She did not agree with my decision and has now ignored the last few messages I sent her.

So am I the asshole for not saying it was me? 

",Asshole,2024-04-28,"AITA for lying to my friend's face in front of our boss? I (32F) and my friend Sarah (34F) work in a retail establishment. We both signed up to work inventory. For reference we have a team come in and scan inventory and we double count and in some sections our own staff will do their own scanning to compare accuracy.

This year I got put up front to count with my friend to do barcode look ups as we are the only 2 who can do it. We both had to do some renewal training so when she left I double counted what was done up front. I noticed one had a missing row of 3 items but while multi tasking I got distracted and had not flagged someone to fix this. I had signed off on the other lines tallied on the ticket for that section as they were correct though. 

We also had our own staff scan this section and they had done it correctly so there was a discrepancy.

Our boss came up looking into the discrepancy saying whoever is counting up here isn't even f-ing counting and everything is f-ing wrong in a rage. When I asked him what was wrong he ignored me and refused to tell me. He just kept lashing out. For context this aggressive behavior is quite common in general and worse when interacting with me because he does not like me on a personal level and tends to make things personal rather than professional which is well known and usually leads to disrespectful conversations and treatment such as this.

So cue my friend who asks if I signed off on the ticket in front of this boss. Had my boss politely asked me if I had done it and explained the discrepancy I would have gladly responded yes and that a row of 3 items was not accounted for and one 1 that would not scan adding up to the missing 4 I just had not flagged anyone down yet.

I started at the same time as two other people, lets call them Nicole and Liam. The three of us get on really well and have helped each other out and supported each other throughout exams.

As the job is primarily work from home, we haven't met up in person as much as we would like. Liam lives in a different town to me and Nicole and our office is in a town none of us live in.

We recently found out we had passed our final exam so Nicole suggested we all go out for drinks to celebrate. I agreed and said it would be good for us to meet up. Liam apologised but said it wouldn't be easy for him to get to us but for us to still meet up anyway and he'll see us in the office another time.

Since it was just going to be me and Nicole we suggested inviting our partners along. Nicole's boyfriend messaged me to thank me for the invite but said he was away with work so would not be able to make it but that he hopes we have a good night. I invited my girlfriend and she just refused. She didn't have a reason, she just said she didn't want to. I said fair enough but mentioned I was still planning on going out to celebrate.

My girlfriend said I should not be going out with just Nicole but I pointed out the only reason it is just me and Nicole is because she is refusing to come. My gf said it's disrespectful but I just repeated that I'm still going and that I deserve to go and celebrate my achievements.

She just repeated that I was being disrespectful and unreasonable and that I should be cancelling.

52,1cfhlbl,WIBTA if I told my boyfriend to be more mindful of his meal/snack portions?,"My BF and I eat most meals together when we're not at work. When I cook I like to make several servings worth and save for leftovers. But unless I proactively separate and put away what I want to save for later, BF ALWAYS will eat whatever is left after I serve myself, even if it's multiple servings.

I'm not necessarily mad because I think he's eating too much. He's a grown up and can make his own decisions about his diet. But it is annoying when, say, I'll make 6 servings worth of pot pie, take one serving for myself, and watch him load the entire rest of the dish onto his own plate.

I will say that he usually asks me if I've taken all I want first, and since I usually don't go for seconds I'll say yes. So I guess I do technically give him the go-ahead. Sometimes I'll respond yes, but I wanted to save some for lunch tomorrow. He'll reply along the lines of ""Oh...well, how much did you want to save?"" and then take the rest of whatever I don't section off to save for later. Which isn't a big deal, but it feels weird to me that I have to physically put away the extra portions instead of him just not taking All Of It every time.

Another issue is when I bring home a treat/special snack and offer some to him, if I don't specify exactly how much I'm willing to share he'll inevitably end up eating most of it. Like a couple weeks ago I brought home a loaf of banana bread my coworker made, planning to make it my breakfast for the next few days. But BF took my offering him a slice as permission to eat 90% of it within 24 hours. What I was planning to make last several days was gone in less than one!

I said something for the first time with the banana bread, and chastised him (mostly in a joking tone) for barely leaving me any and could he please make sure he saves more for me next time. He apologized and seemed like he meant it, but the next night when I made dinner he once again took the entire rest of the dish after I served myself one little portion of it. I almost made another comment but I worry that anything I say will come across as a judgement on how he eats so I held my tongue. 

I'm thinking my best solution is just to continue being proactive about putting what I want for leftovers away ahead of time, but it's annoying to feel like I have to essentially hide food away in order to ensure that I actually get to have my fair share of the dish later on. I want to say ""FOR GOD'S SAKE STOP EATING EVERYTHING!"" but I know it will sound like fat shaming and his feelings will be hurt.

She seemed a little odd just from insta but nice when I was texting her so I didn’t think much of it. She filled out the paperwork saying we were going to room together like 2 weeks ago, I still haven’t done it but we won’t room together if I don’t do it as well.

But we were talking about what we were getting for the room and she asked if I would split the cost of a Kuerig. I just responded I wouldn’t use it because I hate hot coffee so I assumed that pretty clearly meant no. We were also going to split the cost of a fan for the room. I also said that we should wait to buy anything until like august but then 2 days ago she Venmo requested me for $30 more than half of the fan. 

I asked what fan she got that cost that much and she replied “oh I got the fan and the Kuerig.” I was still trying to be nice and said “I’m not paying for half the Kuerig bc I don’t plan on using it.” And she kept telling me stuff like you never know, you probably will need it for like studying and stuff.

I kept trying to just like joke around about it and was like “no I survive on energy drinks I’ll be okay” but she was adamant that I had to split it with her. I said it was a lot of money for something I would never use and she said, “oh I didn’t buy them yet so I could try to find something cheaper.”

I assumed them was referring to the Kuerig and the fan. She still wouldn’t let up so I ghosted her for a few hours while I was with friends and then texted her later Friday night to say “I don’t think we will work as roommates if we bicker this much about something so small. Im still so excited to get to know you when we get there. Have a good one!”

She has been spamming me ever since saying the paperwork is irreversible(which is def not true) and that I need to at least pay her half for the fan. I responded, replying to the message where she said she didn’t buy “them” and she claimed that wasn’t true and she already bought the fan. I don’t believe her because that doesn’t make much sense.

I’ve been ghosting her and started talking to a different girl who dm’d me from the insta post.

i basically just dropped it because there’s not much i can do and it’s not worth it if it’s becoming an argument. i really tried to be as kind as possible and had so many friends review my messages to make sure they weren’t mean in any way. she had blocked me on all socials shortly after i texted her which was also alarming. i cleary knew she was angry so i texted her to ask what was wrong or if i upset her and apologized. 

she responded with a bunch of things that aren’t true and when i attempted to respond she had already blocked me despite me replying within a minute of her text. i never blocked her like she claims and just deactivated my account temporarily. it is confusing how she thinks i blocked her bc she had to see we were following each other when she went to block me. she also has only said hi to me once since i moved out and it was when i was leaving the building in a rush to get dinner before it closed with headphones on and it caught me really off guard and by the time i processed it she had already continued her conversation with her friend. i also did not intentionally ignore her happy birthday message and that is the only message she has sent me since moving out. she sent it over snap and i didn’t see it for weeks until it was pretty late. i’m hardly ever on snap and have always texted her almost exclusively on iMessage so it’s strange she’s taking it to heart.

i just feel like crap tbh and this has been bothering me all day and night. i don’t understand why she’s jumping to conclusions when it’s just a misunderstanding. it seems like she really hates me all of a sudden and it’s hurtful but if i am in the wrong somehow i would want to know. i’m tempted to go to her door and tell her the truth since she only moved into a dorm down the hall with her friend. my boyfriend thinks she’s embarrassed bc she thinks i don’t like her and that i should try to go to her door to talk but my other friends think i should just leave it. i normally don’t post but this is just really bugging me and i hate leaving on such bad terms like this over something that isn’t even true. what are your thoughts? am i the asshole in this? should i go to her door to try to talk or have my boyfriend reach out to tell her the truth about the situation? or even leave her a note? i just hate the thought that she thinks these things and is upset with me when it’s not even true.

I’m also on a strict budget so I asked a friend (31F) to help me. She has gone through the same thing years ago and has also helped her boyfriend with his own kitchen/home renovation. 

We did a simulation on the IKEA planner and I was pretty happy with the result. She helped me a lot by taking measurements and everything so I’m very grateful for her help. The next day I called the contractor who will renovate the kitchen and he gave me a few pointers and we changed a few things. I then went to the IKEA store to modify my project and to ask a few questions since I had a big doubt about the position of some of the furniture. 

I told my friend all this and she took offence saying I only went to these people because they are so called experts and I don’t trust her. She said that after 5 minutes with the contractor I changed my mind and that he convinced me only because I consider him an expert.

58,1cfgozl,AITA for hating my homewrecking aunt?,"So last week my aunt Amy (mom's sister) showed up to my house to wait for my mom to come home. After my mom came home they threw a party which I thought was weird because it was the middle of the week. The next day my brother asked me if I knew why Amy showed up to our house depressed and got extremely drunk. Naturally I asked my mom what happened, she agreed to tell me the entire story. Apparently Amy had been sleeping with her cousin's (my aunt Lily) husband and had become depressed after being found out. Now if that weren't bad enough about 21 years ago Lily had been dating a man for a few years, but before this happened she wanted to introduce her bf to her family including Amy. Upon meeting they seemingly fell in love, ran off and had a child together a year later. After the man left Amy she decided she'd try to make up with Lily but couldn’t, so they didn't talk for the next 20 years. Recently, they started talking again but as soon after Amy started seeing Lily's husband. Lily has two other boyfriends and her husband has multiple girlfriends so Lily can't confront Amy for fear that her own affairs will be exposed. I know it sounds like I'm only blaming the horrible women instead of the deadbeat men in this situation but as a Mexican I've been raised to believe that family matters more than anything. Of course I blame the men but it takes two to tango. These men decided to cheat but at the same time Amy decided to go after taken men. THEY ARE BOTH AT FAULT!!! 

After hearing this story I was disgusted with Amy and wouldn’t do her any favors. My mom was extremely upset at me and said that I shouldn't be mad because ""Amy is our family so we have to stand by her."" My family's pov is that we should support her but I think this is bs.

A lot of the women in my family have suffered over men's infidelity.

My mom told me I am being extremely selfish to ignore how things are just much harder for kids now. Which I also accept, but I have my own families needs to focus on. After a lengthy back and forth she asked me to leave, I told her i loved her and left. She said nothing in return. 

I got home and started to think about the situation. My family is well cared and provided for her, we have minimal debt outside of our home and my wife's car. Our expenses are manageable both my wife and I make good money.

I am not comfortable sharing the actual name due to privacy, so I’m using another name as an example.

He'll often use both hands and drive with his knees while keeping both eyes on his phone. I'd suck it up and deal with it except he's almost hit cars a couple times and we go off the road all the time. Not enough to be dangerous, but enough to be scary. He'll also hold his phone high enough that any passing or waiting cop could see it clearly. The other day we went almost completely off the road and I screamed and scolded him for being on his phone.

64,1cffdx7,"AITA for being truthful with my friends, when telling them I won’t go on a weekend away because I don’t want to talk about marriage / babies for three days?","I (27F), have a group of female friends (8 of us), we have been friends for over a decade, since school. Now we don’t live in the same place, we meet up a couple of times a year for a weekend in an Airbnb. This use to be a weekend of good food, drinks, hot tub etc.

I am content with my life at the moment, I am single, dating and I don’t know if I would like children - but in the event I did I know I wouldn’t want one soon.

Around 5 of my friends are either married or in very long term relationships, of these 5 two either have a baby or are pregnant. I will be seeing all of my friends this year for various wedding / friend / baby events.

I have been invited on this years girls trip, I have said I can’t come. I didn’t originally provide a reason.

When queried, in person by my friend, who is pregnant - I told her the truth. I am not going because it’s a massive financial expense, for three days where we only talk about people’s upcoming engagements / weddings / babies. I have a lot going on, but I feel a lot of my friends do not show an interest unless I talk about some one I’m dating. I also last time, listened to one of my friends talk about her breastfeeding plans, with vengeance, for over an hour. She is not pregnant or trying. Truthfully it’s boring, and it feels dismissive.

It’s also a really expensive way to feel bad about myself.

I made clear when telling my friend this, that I am thrilled for them all living the lives they want, but maybe it’s not the weekend for me at the moment. Meaning it feels like the group has two distinct life stages, I’m in the minority and it focuses on one stage.

My friend has since told me, she’s really hurt I am not excited for her, or our other friends. I responded saying, I evidently was (from other actions), but I just didn’t think the trip was for me. I do have numerous other things on, and to fit this in both in the calendar and financially is a struggle. I just want to add for this friend specifically I have gone on three weekends away for her wedding, and I am flying to go her baby shower - all the in the last two years. I have not asked her, nor has she wanted to fly to see me for anything in the last two years.

So my query is AITA for being truthful with the reason why I can’t go?

  
**UPDATE**, thank you all for your responses and comments. Just a few things to note in response to some of the general themes of response.   
1. I DO show an interest in their weddings, engagements, babies and baby plans. I am excited for them, I text about it, I ask for updates, I go to AND help plan events for these things. My issue is, three days of talking about this like it’s the only topic of substance is not fun, especially when I don’t feel an interest is reciprocated to me on my life.   
2. I have spoken to one of my other friends invite on the trip (who is also not at the baby stage of life), she is also not going on the trip, and said she is not attending for the same reason.   
3. The friend I expressed this too has apologised for her initial reaction, and is still trying to convince me to come. I am not going to go, but I am hoping she at least considers what I have shared.   
4. I do have other friends, in the city I live in, and they are a joy to be in the company of. Maybe this is because we became friends as adults, and have more similar lifestyles, who knows. 

Finally - some comments about me being jealous, hating myself / my life etc. To confirm dear strangers on the internet, I am content - thank you for the concern though.

Around 5 of my friends are either married or in very long term relationships, of these 5 two either have a baby or are pregnant. I will be seeing all of my friends this year for various wedding / friend / baby events.

I have been invited on this years girls trip, I have said I can’t come. I didn’t originally provide a reason.

When queried, in person by my friend, who is pregnant - I told her the truth. I am not going because it’s a massive financial expense, for three days where we only talk about people’s upcoming engagements / weddings / babies. I have a lot going on, but I feel a lot of my friends do not show an interest unless I talk about some one I’m dating. I also last time, listened to one of my friends talk about her breastfeeding plans, with vengeance, for over an hour. She is not pregnant or trying. Truthfully it’s boring, and it feels dismissive.

It’s also a really expensive way to feel bad about myself.

I made clear when telling my friend this, that I am thrilled for them all living the lives they want, but maybe it’s not the weekend for me at the moment. Meaning it feels like the group has two distinct life stages, I’m in the minority and it focuses on one stage.

My friend has since told me, she’s really hurt I am not excited for her, or our other friends. I responded saying, I evidently was (from other actions), but I just didn’t think the trip was for me. I do have numerous other things on, and to fit this in both in the calendar and financially is a struggle. I just want to add for this friend specifically I have gone on three weekends away for her wedding, and I am flying to go her baby shower - all the in the last two years. I have not asked her, nor has she wanted to fly to see me for anything in the last two years.

So my query is AITA for being truthful with the reason why I can’t go?

  
**UPDATE**, thank you all for your responses and comments. Just a few things to note in response to some of the general themes of response.   
1. I DO show an interest in their weddings, engagements, babies and baby plans. I am excited for them, I text about it, I ask for updates, I go to AND help plan events for these things. My issue is, three days of talking about this like it’s the only topic of substance is not fun, especially when I don’t feel an interest is reciprocated to me on my life.   
2. I have spoken to one of my other friends invite on the trip (who is also not at the baby stage of life), she is also not going on the trip, and said she is not attending for the same reason.   
3. The friend I expressed this too has apologised for her initial reaction, and is still trying to convince me to come. I am not going to go, but I am hoping she at least considers what I have shared.   
4. I do have other friends, in the city I live in, and they are a joy to be in the company of. Maybe this is because we became friends as adults, and have more similar lifestyles, who knows. 

Finally - some comments about me being jealous, hating myself / my life etc. To confirm dear strangers on the internet, I am content - thank you for the concern though. ",0.0,1.052559733390808,1,0

It is a surprise. For a week and a half now we have been in a fight due to an event.
My bf suggested to me a month ago that we organize a vacation in May before he goes to the army. I accepted with great pleasure and pushed us to organize a vacation together. But when it came time to pay for the tickets he started avoiding my messages about the trip.

For 4 days as soon as I texted him about the trip he didn't answer me. I asked him several times if there was a problem he didn't tell me about it and seemed very keen on the idea of ​​leaving. Suddenly it tells me that he is “not very ready to leave anymore”. 

It started with us not going abroad (we have to stay in Europe because he hasn't had his passport redone).
Then it continued with a new excuse, saying that the start of him joining the army was at the beginning of July, which was too close to the vacation. Since that day I have been very angry with him for changing his mind overnight and not having communicated.

For a little more information, it's not the first time that he talks to me about a project, that I start to make it happen and as it is almost ready he tells me he no longer wants to do it. I've been trying for 3 days to get him to make a compromise, to go to Greece for 4 days instead of the 10 initially planned. He continues to refuse, telling me that he does not have to compromise on a trip and does not feel selfish in the story despite having made a firm decision on a subject that also concerns me.

So, my friend Jo (27M) lives on the other side of the country and is coming to my city to meet his GF, Bo (27F) who is flying in from another country for a few months. So, around the end of March, through text, he told me he is coming in May. On 3rd April, he asked me if he can crash at my place and gave me the dates - 21st to 27th May. I said, yes, he can. 

Context for the apartment in question. My family has two apartments. The first, my uncle bought back in the 90s. I have lived in this apartment since I was born. The second belongs to my parents since 2014. From 2017 - end Jan 2023, I was living in that apartment, alone. The two are on either end of the city. It takes about 40 mins b/w them.

There were many times I hosted my friends, including Bo, who is closer to me, there for a few days. One of these times, Jo had come too. They lived in a hotel for a day and then stayed at mine for a week. I used to do most of the cooking and house chores, because I wanted to. My friends paid for some groceries and meals, but every other bill was paid either by me or my parents.

Then, in Feb 2023, I had to come to the old apartment, where my uncle lives. I have moved almost everything important from the other apartment to this.  So, the new apartment is vacant, collecting dust. When my father is here, we go and get it cleaned, but only the bare minimum, and once every few months. If I wanna house guests there, I would have to pay to get it deep cleaned, wash and change all the sheets, and buy a lot of groceries.

The reason I agreed to him crashing in the new apartment like the last time was because the weather was nice and I was going out a lot, getting a lot done. Getting the house cleaned did not feel daunting at the time. Yesterday, my dad told me to ask him not to, because at some point they will take me for granted. There is also a heatwave going on for weeks now, and it's impossible to go out, let alone travel back and forth b/w the two apartments to get the other one to be habitable. I told him and Bo, that I won't be able to host them, that my mom wasn't happy with the arrangement and it was too hot to get anything done. My argument is the same, and that I gave them almost a month's notice. At first I felt guilty, but then they began to say that I should have told them before so he did not plan for so many days and booked flights. Now he has to change flight dates and, acc. to Bo, it will be a big fin. burden on him to do that AND get a hotel room. She can't keep him in her house because of her parents, but doesn't want to live with him in a hotel because last time, the hotel was terrible. I looked for good places for him for this time.

Bo is messaging me, telling me that it is very financially stressful for them, and maybe he should just not come. This is making me feel cornered and pressured to say yes to housing them.

Trying to figure out how best to deal with a situation and think I need some outside opinions. **Would I be the AH if I told she cant go to prom as a consequence of these decisions?**

Back story, 16 year old sister in law who lives with us due to irreconcilable differences with parents got drunk in a public place and blacked out at her friends house later.  Friend called us in a panic and we had her taken to the hospital where her BAC was dangerously high.  This is not the first time this has happened.  She is in weekly therapy.

My wife and I are at our wits end with her.  She is combative with us any time we fuss at her for doing things she isn't supposed to do.  She has brought weed vapes into the house (I have three of my own kids and I don't want them around that).  She brought Oxy into the home once.  She is dis-respectful to us.  She lies to us all the time.  Argues every time she doesn't get her way.  Again this is not the first time with drinking.  First time it was at a friends house, the mom of all people gave it to her.  Second time was at a school football game where my son is in the marching band.  Third time was on the BUS ride to school.  Blacked out in the hall way.  This time was at a different friends house.  Obviously we cut off contact with these people that enable her.  She always finds new people.  Her therapist tells us we need to give her some freedoms as a sign of trust but ever time we give just a little bit she does things like this.

70,1cfemt6,AITA for trying to help a friend with an embarrassing health problem?,"Hello everyone,

(sorry for the spelling mistakes, my english isn't perfect)

First of all, here's the background. I (21F) have known ""Marie"" (22F, pseudo of course) for 2 years, we're studying the same course at university and she's become a friend over time. We've been really close for 1 year now, to the point that since September 2023 we've decided to share a flat with 2 other mutual friends. The important thing in this story is that Marie has been having health problems for +/- 1 year and I've really been her confidante through all the stress of her diagnosis etc. It's been a while since she's had to deal with a diagnosis.

For some time now, she's been experiencing sudden dizziness, numbness in her legs for several 10s of minutes, etc. In short, she ended up having several medical imaging tests and learning that she unfortunately has multiple sclerosis. She told me as soon as she found out, and I did my best to support her.

Lately I've noticed that she seems stressed out and hardly ever goes out with our group of mutual friends anymore, each time having a reason to stay at home. I noticed this + the fact that she sometimes seemed very nervous recently, so I asked her if there was anything wrong...and she broke down crying, telling me that because of her problem she also had major bladder issues. I remembered a few moments recently when I saw her sometimes get up suddenly and run to the bathroom in a panic, and it really affected me to know that she had to deal with this on top of everything else. 

As the weeks went by, I saw her more and more withdrawn and visibly sad, and yesterday I asked her to come to the restaurant with our group. She was completely depressed and replied: ""I'd love to, but I can't because of what I told you, and I know I'm isolating myself and I'm going to lose my friends"".

It broke my heart to hear him say that. So, even though I knew that medically nothing could help her, I had this awkward word to say, thinking of a time in my life when I spent 2 weeks wearing diapers to school because of kidney stones. I said something like ""I've never told you about it, but I've had this kind of problem before, and even if it's not ideal, there are protections that at least allow you to live normally until it gets better"".

She burst into tears, opened her cupboard and showed me a pack of ""protections"" and said, ""I've already got some diapers, but they're for life in my situationand that doesn't stop me wanting to disappear when I have to use them. I know you want to help me and that's great of you, but I'm screwed, leave me alone and go and find people who aren't broken"".

I left and since then she hasn't spoken to me, hasn't replied to messages where I've apologized for my clumsy words.

So we booked a hall with only 50 guest as per restrictions according to hall. And my mother's side of the family is extremely huge (like she has over 5 siblings). But anyway. I messaged the same to them as I did with my father's side of the family, and I only got 2 responses from his side. But it's cool. 

So the day before my wedding alot of preparations had to be done and low and behold uncle president said we on locked down. To which the hall called us to let us know that it won't be available anymore. So instead of privately messaging everyone. I noted on my whatsApp story that the venue is not available anymore. So we will be doing a drive by wedding and that everyone can come. So basically we had a house wedding with a drive by. 

Anyhow my father's side of the family then contacted my grandmother after the wedding saying how disrespectful it was to not invite them to my wedding. I should have personally drove to each of their houses and let them know about the wedding and should've gave them their physical invitations. I then told my grandmother that why should I drive all the way to each of their houses with invitations when I literally found out the day before my wedding that venue is cancelled due to locked down. I literally had to make alternative plans the night before to ensure that day goes well with regards to decorations. She still didn't understand and said that I favored my mother's side of the family more than hers and that I am an asshole who is unappreciated of her family. I then had to remind her that not once did that family visit us when I was alot younger. We always to visit them. Like what's wrong with our house??? And why is it that they want special treatment. When I literally made a post about the change on whatsapp and the reasoning behind it. And those 2 that said they will come did. Oh and those that called my grandma saw my post on whatsApp literally minutes after I posted it. 

She said its been weighing on chest about she wanted to bring it up. I told her she should've told me when they called at that time. Not tell me 3 years later after I got married. 


So AITA for not personally sending out my father's side of the family invites??

When I graduated they did not do the same for me. I asked about it and they said my husband should provide. I wasn't married. I still lived at home. 

Three years later I met my husband. We dated for a year and then we got engaged. My parents were overjoyed. When we set a date they gave me a check for $50,000 to pay for the wedding. WTF?  

I took the check and we eloped. We then used the check for a downpayment on a house. My husband had a similar amount saved up so we are in a good spot with equity. 

My parents bare furious that they didn't get a big wedding for all their friends and family to attend. 

They said that they gave me the money for a wedding. My argument is that I got married and had leftover money. Accurate in my books.

75,1cfdmq9,WIBTA if I travelled alone or with my best friend instead of my girlfriend?,"Me (36M) and my partner (30F) have been together for 2.5 years. We both love to travel. When we first met I had been to quite a few places around the world, owing to the fact that I have been in my job for around 17 years, and travel has been my primary reward for working FT over most of this time.

My girlfriend had only been overseas twice, as she only had her first FT job about a year into our relationship. Knowing that we both wanted to travel more became a motivation and last year we both went to NZ for around two weeks, which was fantastic. 

When we started the relationship I had initially planned a 3 month trip with my best friend of 16 years (38M), who is also my housemate. This was planned in early 2020, long before I was in a relationship. Girlfriend didn't like that idea at all, so it was eventually scraped. 

Lately (past six months or so) the urge for travel has become stronger and stronger, mixed with some homesickness - I live on the other side of the world and haven't been ""home"" in almost seven years now. Unfortunately my girlfriend was made redundant around 2 months ago which meant she has no holidays at all. By comparison, I have around 11 weeks as Covid stopped my usual routine of saving up holidays and then going for longer trips as I figure to maximize my time off. 

Recently I've made the comment that I would be okay going either with the friend - he's in a similar situation with his holiday balance and he also needs a break as he works FT - or solo. I put forward a compromise where I would limit it to 3-4 weeks as I don't want to have the time paid out and staycations seem like a waste (to both of us, girlfriend) agrees, and also planning bigger longer trips with her once her holiday balance is up again. She doesn't want me going without her at all. She says she would be jealous of me and there would be some resentment over me going somewhere when she can't.

76,1cfdf1v,WIBTAH? I think my sisters boyfriend stole my earbuds.,"As the title says, im pretty sure my sisters boyfriend stole my earbuds but i dont know how or if i should tell her or confront him. Situation complicated.

My sister and this guy, lets call him Rob, have been in an on-again off-again relationship that goes back at least the last 9 years. We've suspected he's stolen from us before, from my parents, brother, sister and i also suspect from my nephew but since he hasnt been caught in the act, its hard to prove.

For convenience i keep my earbuds on a shelf in the living room. They were a gift from my sister and her boyfriend helped her pick them out. He has the same kind only older. 

Now, he is not the father of my nephew but my sister gave him the title(complicated but not relevant to the story)so he comes over to see them off to school in the mornings. 

I have no way of knowing when exactly the theft would have taken place. I dont use my earbuds everyday, and everything breaks eventually, so i didnt suspect theft until later. But all of a sudden they started to give me trouble. Not wanting to charge from their charging case but needing to be plugged into an outlet. Their is also a crack on the bottom of the charging case that was never their before. 

Its difficult to bring up my suspicions to my sister. She gets pissed off whenever anyone says anything critical about him. Like in a if were criticizing him were criticizing her type of way. I did bring it up to my mother and she looked at it and mentioned that it looked a little scuffed along with it being cracked and said she thought mine was in pristine condition as i take care of my things. That made me realize that mine WEREN'T in pristine condition. On mine their were scratches where the plug goes into the charging case. The ones i have now has no scratches. Clearly not the same case. 

I believe he switched his broken earphones with mine when he was here one morning, believing i wouldnt notice the difference. 

Is this enough proof? Should i talk to my sister about it? Should i let it go? Would it be worth the possible bitchfest that WILL go down if she dosent believe me? Would i be the AH for confronting him with this little proof?

77,1cfddvw,AITA for telling my dad to stop asking questions he doesn't want the answers to even if we are in therapy?,"My dad has me (16m) going to therapy with him.

BG: My parents broke up when I was just a baby. They were never married. Dad wasn't in my life as much when I was really young. He had to work out of town a lot. So I would see him every other weekend and if he could take me for two weeks in the summer he would. Sometimes I went years without seeing him for Christmas too. He only quit the job when he met his wife Lisa when I was 9. I admit it stung a lot. They got married fast (8 months of dating). And I was 10 when Lisa was pregnant for the first time.

My mom ended up having a brain aneurism the day Lisa had their first kid. My dad was told and he said he couldn't make it because Lisa was showing signs of early labor. He wanted me to be brought to them but I refused to go and I told him mom was dying and I needed him. He told me he couldn't leave Lisa or miss seeing the baby be born. But he said he wanted me by his side so come to him. I ended up staying. He didn't come. My mom died the same day his first kid was born. Then he tried to take me to the hospital to see the baby like 12 hours after I lost my mom and he talked non stop about the baby. I told him I'd never forgive him.

And I haven't. Lisa told me I should understand and be happy for them and their daughter that she got to have dad watch her be born. I told her they weren't my problem. She said I had a bratty attitude. I didn't care.

I stopped being close to dad. I never developed a relationship with his daughter or his other son. I don't have a relationship with Lisa. Dad tried therapy a few times. He tried telling me to see the positive. To take joy in the fact I got to come home to a baby sibling. I told him I'd rather have my mom. I told him I wanted my dad with me in the worst moment of my life. But his wife and new kid were more important.

Over the years he told me he wanted things to get better but I didn't. A few months ago Lisa said I should live with my grandparents or my aunt out of state if I feel this way. I said I agreed. Dad thought I was joking and it took him 2 months to realize I was serious and he brought me to therapy.

The questions started. Don't I love them (him, Lisa and the kids), don't I want us to move past all this (no is the answer to both except for maybe loving dad but I'm also angry at him). Then he asked me if I really wanted to move out. Yes. Then it was imagine how Lisa and the kids feel. I don't care. The therapist lets him ask and lets me answer. They never really say much. He asked me if I cared about his other kids at all and I said no. He got so distressed and agitated and I told him to stop asking questions he doesn't want the answers to even if we are in therapy. He told me I'm not even trying. And I told him I had told him that already. He said therapy is about asking questions and working through things and I'm not behaving the way I should.

79,1cfd5mc,AITA for not apologizing further after accusing someone of cheating?,"I (29M) joined my girlfriend (30F) for a board game buffet brunch three days ago for a get together with a couple of her work friends that I wasn't familiar with. There were about eight of us (I was one of three men) and we decided to play scrabble after a quick round of zombie dice. 

I love board games I like believing in the integrity of the game. During the scrabble game I was impressed by the vocabulary of... let's call her Cassidy. She played a lot of big words and managed to secure a good chunk of points through it all.

After the third time this happened (just after she drank a glass of water) I called her out on it like ""Wow, I guess some of us have to rely on more than our brains to really play together.""

Cassidy got quiet and handed me the device she was using. It said 'Glucose/blood sugar/blood pressure' on it. She explained that she was just checking her blood sugar through the brunch.

I went pale and didn't say anything for the rest of the game. The game changed to a fake artist goes to new york and I went with Cassidy to get extra markers. I apologized to Cassidy when we got hte markers, saying that I didn't like it when people played games off of what I perceived to be a different advantage and she said it was uncomfortable but she could see how I mistook that for happening. We finished up brunch and the board games and started to head off.

When my girlfriend and I got back to our place she started saying that what I did was a total social gaffe. I agreed with her and I told her when we got a fake artist I apologized to CAssidy. She said that wasn't a good enough apology because I publically humiliated her and I needed to publically apologize to her. I didn't agree with this statement because I think public apologies are just a way to save face with people who weren't involved in the conflict. I said that I apologized directly to her and she said she accepted the apology.

The next day I went to pick up my girlfriend from work and she said that it was the perfect time to apologize to Cassidy in public as Cassidy was just pulling into her shift. I didn't want to make a big deal of it so I just walked off to the car. My girlfriend followed but I've been getting a frosty reception ever since.

I (29M) joined my girlfriend (30F) for a board game buffet brunch three days ago for a get together with a couple of her work friends that I wasn't familiar with. There were about eight of us (I was one of three men) and we decided to play scrabble after a quick round of zombie dice. 

I love board games I like believing in the integrity of the game. During the scrabble game I was impressed by the vocabulary of... let's call her Cassidy.

  I (17f) am graduating soon and couldn’t be more excited for it. As most graduation ceremonies go you are allowed to invite those who would like to watch you walk for the ceremony and my grandmother was on the list until some of her actions made me rethink it. 
   For context she used to live in a low income apartments until her landlord told her she needed to move out since she was making more money and had no more need to live in those apartments.  Since she was making more money you’d think she would go and get a nicer place but no she decides to stay in a motel which is more expensive than actually getting another apartment. She stays in the motel and accuses me and my family of being cruel for not helping her find a place when we live 5 hours away from her and there is no room at our place for her stay. And it’s not like I can buy her a whole house when I’m only 17.
   My mother had tried to talk to her about it but my grandmother refuses to reason with her. She would text me directly accusing me of being a terrible granddaughter and being selfish. She would do this even when I was at work so I had to block her number as it was affecting my life. She even accused me to my mother that I had smoked pot and that she had proof. (I have never in my life touched pot and I have no idea why she would even accuse me of something like this.) After a while my grandmother texted me through my cousins phone saying “We will be at your graduation but if your mom wants to start drama then so be it.”

83,1cfcwwe,AITA for wanting my boyfriend not to go to his dad’s retirement party?,"My 26M boyfriend and I 26F had planned a trip back in March for a long weekend in May. This would be our first trip together and after we agreed on where we would be staying and booked it I told him to put it in his calendar (in March when we booked). Fast forward to this past week, he texts me asking if we can either a) move the trip or b) cut the trip short, because he told his family that he was free on one of the days our trip was already scheduled, for his dads retirement party and then later realized that our trip was the weekend. Keep in mind this trip is really 2 days of actually being where we are going the other days we are traveling back and forth.

 I had told him that I was not moving the trip because I already had requested the time off work and I can’t get it back because it is approved and the place we are staying is non-refundable; and that I am not leaving the trip early because I don’t want to go to the retirement party. 

We had discussed and he was convinced that he would travel back and forth on the day to go to the trip (over 8 hours) and the party then come back so we can check out the next day. I frankly told him this was stupid and made no sense. So then he tried to rearrange the trip so he can do both. I also expressed to him that I don’t even feel like going now because clearly a trip that was supposed to be about us (we have been going through a really rough patch) and reconnecting was now about his dad because he chose not to mark his calendar and double booked himself. And now wants me to either spend an entire day of the trip by myself and or change the plans we had so he can still go to the party. 

I understand his dad retiring is a big deal but our trip was planned months ago and his dad’s party was planned a week ago. I expressed to him how I felt like this was his saying our relationship was not a priority to him and that my trust for him keeping his word to me is broken.

84,1cfctbf,WIBTA if I send my mother to jail for stealing my identity while my father is on his deathbed?,"I recently decided that i wanted to try and sign up for a credit card. I had hoped it would be different than past attempts.

I (23F) had always had issues with credit in the past and I had assumed it had to do with having zero credit, until i checked my credit score for the first time. Everytime I applied for an apartment, a car loan, a student loan, even the most basic credit card, I was denied.

I prepared for my search for the perfect starter card for folks with no credit. I joined a credit union and their app features a credit report and I was shocked to see that I did indeed have credit, and it was not good, sitting in the lowest of the 400's with debt collections. I had always assumed my problem was having no credit.

I brazenly researched ways to dispute the collections. I noticed something familiar. One of the credit lines sent to collections  was from a  catalog called Fingerhut.

There was no way i had accessed this credit, and So I was certain this was fraud. I reread the facts laid to me by the credit score for about 15 minutes before it had dawned on me.

My estranged mother had always openly struggled with her credit. She would often engage in lowball tactics to elevate her credit or establish a line of credit to fuel spending. She would often patron Rent-A-Centers and catalogs such as Fingerhut(her fav) which brag basic credit that can be spent within their catalog.

Seeing Fingerhut in my debt collections on the report made me consider that the identity theft was someone i knew, the only person i knew who used Fingerhut and knows my social security. My mom.

I called their support line yesterday to try to figure out if this was malicious. I had to try the support line for another debt because i wanted answers and I didnt want to wait until the following monday, when other call centers would open

Speaking to the agent i could sense she was concerned i was fishing for someone elses information so I told her I had moved around many times since the debt and changed phone numbers/address so i needed to see which information matched the file. Thiankfully this convinced her. I was worried I wouldnt be able to get the answers i needed and the data would kept behind a wall of fraudulent Authentication protection.

The representative reluctantly revealed the phone number, two addresses and a teachers employee email, all of which matched my estranged mother

I havent spoken to my parents in 4 years but i understand my father is terminally ill with cancer. They are still married and very close, and she has been doing her best to take care of him from what i hear.

85,1cfcqdo,AITA for trying not to tip the Valet ,"I went to a restaurant last night that has complimentary valet parking (meaning that they have no self parking available and it’s all valet). I had never been here before and didn’t know this. I also arrived by myself and being a girl, did not want to park farther away and have to walk far alone at night to the restaurant. 

When we were leaving, two of my friends rode with me to our next destination. I told them I didn’t have cash on me and that i had some buried in my car that I would have to dig for when I got in. I asked if it would be rude of me to just not tip the guy this time. They both said no and we all noted how we could see the guy going only about 10/15 feet away from the font of the restaurant to get my car because it was parked right by the front. 

Well once I am walking to get into my car, and I hadn’t even put my butt in my seat yet, the man goes “so will you be using cash app or Venmo?” I was pretty shocked… I responded by saying “how much is it?” (knowing that it was free valet). He told me it was just for tips. So I started digging for my cash that I had in my car. I was annoyed at this guy’s audacity at this point so I just grabbed $1 and held it out to him. To which he looks at it and goes “oh.” And he tries to push it back towards me. I just sat there holding it out and staring at him until he took it and I left. 

This interaction left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought that the guy handled it very poorly but that I also could’ve just tipped in the first place. I hadn’t fully decided not to yet but when he saw me without money in my had and asks me before I even get in my car how I will be tipping him, it really irked me. Was that inappropriate of him? Was it rude on my part? For context, I work in a restaurant as a waitress so I obviously respect tipping but I feel like this is different… I can elaborate on my reasons for thinking this in the comments is anyone would like me to. 

Elaborating : tipping a server at a restaurant vs. a valet is different to me because of the service that is provided. You are spending most likely an hour or so in my section at a restaurant. I am bringing you everything that you need to ensure that you enjoy your experience during that hour. I am also paying tip out to the other staff on the bill. (Look that up if you don’t understand how that works). Tipping a server at a restaurant is also as a “reward” to a job well done. If I gave you good service during your visit, you leave a good tip. If I didn’t give you good service, you leave a bad tip. The hope of getting a good tip is why I am going to try my best at every table to give them the best experience possible. There are times when I don’t get tipped or I get tipped poorly. Of course this is upsetting, but I would never follow a table out the door and ask if they’re going to be tipping me by Venmo or cash app then. Someone pulling my car around only warrants a couple bucks in my opinion. The reason I pulled out only $1 is because of this guy’s entitlement. That really is the whole principle of the issue imo. I can accept that it’s a dick move on my part and I won’t try to not tip a valet in the future, trust me I’ve learned now lol, but he was an asshole to ask me to stand there outside of my car and a pull out my phone to give him $5 for pulling my car around? The only words he ever spoke to me were “cash app or Venmo”. He didn’t even attempt to help in or out of my car during the experience and like I said, I hadn’t even gotten back into my vehicle before he is asking me for his tip. He was an asshole for that, so I was an asshole back with my $1 tip to him. But I don’t think attitude like that for poor service needed to be rewarded with a $5 tip amount. That’s why I gave him $1. Tipping culture is out of hand, as someone who works in an industry that is based on tips. All of this bullshit is ruining it for us. Tipping is a reward for good service and hard work. It shouldn’t be expected. I know when I am not the best server to my tables and don’t expect a 20% tip in exchange for the job that I did. I also know when I do a job worth 20% and don’t get that. It sucks but I move on. I don’t have the same entitled attitude as this guy. 

Anyway, thanks for the feedback. I should’ve asked my friends for their cash so that I could have given him something off the bat. I can accept being the asshole there. I also appreciate those who agree that the man working acted entitled and unprofessional.

It shouldn’t be expected. I know when I am not the best server to my tables and don’t expect a 20% tip in exchange for the job that I did. I also know when I do a job worth 20% and don’t get that. It sucks but I move on. I don’t have the same entitled attitude as this guy. 

Anyway, thanks for the feedback. I should’ve asked my friends for their cash so that I could have given him something off the bat. I can accept being the asshole there. I also appreciate those who agree that the man working acted entitled and unprofessional. ",1.0,1.0640276670455933,1,1
86,1cfcbjm,AITA for laughing when my friend opened up to me?,"My (M19) friend called me (F18) yesterday and was showing me a bracelet he had gotten from an ex-talking stage, and it had something funny written on it. When I asked what happened between them, he was hesitant to say at first but it didn’t take much convincing to get it out. Apparently, he lost her during an event and when he found her she was holding hands with another guy.

Just some context, this friend is a person that doesn’t take a lot of things seriously and is just very funny. Whenever we’re in group settings he’s always the one making jokes.

My response to what happened was to start laughing, as he had been laughing too when he was telling the story. I admit, I laughed way longer than I should have, but the call wasn’t longer than 4 minutes. 

He proceeded to hang up and when I asked why, he started calling me a terrible person and to stop talking to him because he was disappointed in me. I was confused at first, and I was asking why he was so angry. He was actually being vulnerable and opening up to me about her, but I hadn’t realized at all. When I told him, he said I was playing the ignorant and victim card. Our conversation went around in circles with him name calling and telling me to stop talking to him and me apologizing, but I eventually did manage to apologize to the point where he was OK and said he would talk to me later to clear it up.

I said to him that it's great that he is happy, but that he shouldn't get his hopes up too high because it's only his first relationship. He seemed to take offense to that and said that he doesn't care what I think. I told him that he should not think that this girl is the love of his life just yet because it's only been a few months, and most people don't end up marrying the first person they date. I told him that i'm not saying his relationship will not last, but i said don't be surprised if it doesn't. He got mad at me and claimed that I am jealous of his relationship. That was 3 days ago and i just found out that he has me blocked on instagram.

89,1cfbn8k,AITA Baby Shower Registry and In Law Drama,"I’m 8 months pregnant and had my baby shower recently. When I was throwing around the idea of having a shower my friend offered to throw me one. I got married less that 2 years ago and am showered out (I had 4) but I agreed to have 1 and was happy my friend was throwing one for me. I told my friends and family I was only having one but they were more than welcome to come. My mother in law kept texting me asking when we would set a date. The second we set a date for it I told her. I also created my registry after lots of time and research on what I will be needing. I in NO WAY expect people to buy anything for me honestly and feel guilty when people do. I more so use my registry as a list and full expected to purchase what I needed off of this list, it’s just a perk if someone gets it for me. 
Fast forward a couple weeks and my registry is pinging (I haven’t sent invites out yet). When I look it’s my husbands cousins who I don’t know that well buying stuff off of it. The venue I booked for the shower was small and I had my guest list set already. My mother in law then texted me asking if my husbands cousins could bring their kids to the shower. (I sent gifts to all his cousins that send me baby shower invites. I wasn’t going to send them invites and in no way expected any gifts from them.) we had a awkward conversation that they weren’t invited and it was going to to just be my MILs sisters. No one from her family marked anything else as purchased from the registry so I assumed maybes the auntss would bring the purchased stuff since it was marked as purchased on my registry or maybe they’d just return it. 
We had my shower and it was great. I mentioned to my husband that his cousins purchased some stuff off my registry I needed and didn’t give it to us so I was going to just buy it. But I was kinda bummed I wouldn’t get the completion discount and wish they would have waited or just not gotten me anything. 
He then called me all excited and said his cousins have his mom all the stuff for her house. I told him the toys were for 0-6 month olds and I wasn’t planning on dropping my child off with his mom when I’m home in leave and it’s annoying they marked it on my registry that I created.

One joked that white people smell like ham & she thought it was funny & jokingly asked what other races smell like. I rolled my eyes bc I never know what she's gonna say as she gets a kick out of offending people.

20 years ago I stopped talking to my parents & sis bc they were mad I was dating someone 1/2 black & said terrible things ie: he looks like a monkey. My sis & I know we r different in our political/human rights views. We live 1 hour away from each other & keep in touch by having convos over Snapchat video messages. She'll say things like ""I know you dont like the word ""gay"" used to say something's bad (I'm bi), ""but this was f\*cking gay"". Or says ""n\*gga"" & laughs. Since it isnt a live video call she never sees my eye rolls.

When she saw my reaction she got upset & says THEY were the ones who started making jokes so why is it a problem? I said I worry what will happen if you say the wrong thing in front of ppl/person who dont take it well. She said she doesnt go around freely saying these things. I said its good you dont go around saying stuff like this but how am I supposed to know how you act in all social situations?

91,1cfahjo,AITA for letting my husband’s family name die out by insisting our daughter takes mine?,"So I (F31) have been with my husband (M30) for 10 years, married for 3. I kept my last name when we got married, and he has no plans to change his. We have a baby girl due in August, but we’ve recently run into a problem with his parents about the naming of our child. 

Now my husband’s family name is quite unfortunate. I won’t say what it is for privacy reasons, but it’s a very slightly different spelling of a sexual word. You also should know it’s a sexual word that mostly be used for or relate to a female rather than a male. Because of this, we agreed together that our children will take my family name to prevent bullying in school and throughout their youth. I felt even stronger about this when I found out we were having a girl – growing up a girl is a pretty rough experience anyway, and myself and so many of my friends experienced harassment and sexual comments from young men growing up even without an unfortunate surname. It sucks but it’s reality, and I want to minimise my daughter’s experience of this as much as possible. 

We have recently broken this news to my husband’s parents and they are very upset about it. For context, he is their only child and they had to try for over 10 years to have him. They are a small family and his parents only have sisters who took their husbands’ names. This means that my husband is the only chance to carry on their family name and they’re upset that we’re taking that chance away and effectively ending the family name. Although it was a mutual decision between my husband and I, they are particularly upset with me because I have three younger brothers who could have kids and carry on my family name, and yet I “feel the need” to “take” theirs away.

We’ve tried explaining the reasons but they think I’m being overdramatic. They were insulted that I could compare their last name to a dirty word and they say my husband “never had any issues” when he was young. It’s true he didn’t experience that much harassment in school (aside from occasional mild bullying) but he is a male and like I said the word relates a lot more to a female, and also girls are so much more likely to be sexually harassed by boys than vice versa. 

I know that teenage boys can be cruel, so I just want to give my daughter and any future kids the best chance at minimising harassment. AITA?

I could be the asshole because I would be asking my friends to speak in a language they aren’t as comfortable in when they have someone to speak that with. ",1.0,1.0388745069503784,1,1
93,1cfaffu,AITA for “flaking” on my friend’s birthday trip and other events?,"So I (22f) have a friend (22f) that I’ve known for years. I would say that she’s one of my best friends. She is the friend I normally do events with, like concerts and festivals, or clubbing. We also have sleepovers and do chill things, and I always have a wonderful time with her. 

My financial situation is not the best right now, and she has offered numerous times in the past to either front me the money for something for us to do together, or just pay for it herself straight out. I accepted a few times, but in the past 6 months I have been saying no to pretty much everything that costs more than ~$50. I didn’t want to take advantage and I knew I could not afford it.  My friend has a very steady income and can afford these things, and I am still trying to find my footing in my career, so our financial caps are very different. I cannot afford such a large expense. 

The issue is this: She let me know her birthday plans back in November, and let me know that we would be traveling in mid February. I said it sounded fun and I would do everything in my power to be there. She offered to pay for my plane ticket straight out and said that I could pay her back in consecutive payments. I initially agreed because I genuinely thought my financial situation would improve within that four months period. By early January, I knew I could not afford it and let her know immediately. I asked her if she could refund my ticket and she said that it was extremely last minute and there was little chance of a refund. I apologized at the time and offered to try and resale the ticket myself, and pay for whatever was left over if need be, but that I could not attend and maybe someone else could use the ticket. She refused and said her brother would handle it. 

I tried to reach out so we could talk a few times and she pretty much disengaged every time. I left her alone until yesterday, when she texted me a long paragraph about how I am a flakey friend and provided numerous examples including: cancelling on her last minute and leaving her to figure out the plane ticket expense by herself, not showing up to the club for a night out, “forgetting” we had plans in the first place, etc. I apologized for upsetting her but stood by the fact that I had let her know my situation numerous times and expecting me to make it happen anyways is unfair. She accepted my apology but did not engage with me past that. AITA? 

Edit: I might be the AH because I have cancelled on her a few times, but only ever when I cannot afford it.

95,1cfaae2,AITA for “not taking care of her insecurities”?,"I've been in a relationship with my partner for almost 8 months now. She (24F) and I (30M).
Since we started dating, I've noticed that she has a big insecurity problem. At the beginning of the relationship, without me having done anything to provoke it, she would interrogate me about my past. We could be doing anything, and out of nowhere, she'd ask me questions (which frankly felt like interrogations) about people I followed or who followed me on social media and/or things in my past. 
With the intention of calming her anxieties and being transparent, I would try to explain in detail, but she would refuse to listen, claiming that ""the more she knew, the worse things she would think."" I told her it didn't have to be like that because I respected her, and what I was telling her was true.

Recently, I had to delete my Instagram because the interrogations about my past were becoming too frequent. I wanted to give her fewer reasons to doubt and to create a secure environment so that she could heal, but the first thing she did was doubt me, telling me she felt like I was hiding something and that it was suspicious that I deleted my Instagram.
After that, the interrogations did decrease, but they didn't disappear. I suggested that it would be best for her to start seeing a psychologist (I already do it for other family issues), and she also took this defensively, arguing that she has ""other forms of therapy"" (reading, writing, etc.) and that I'm nobody to condition her healing process.

Now this is the question of my post:
What happened now is that she's on a trip with her family, and I responded to her message with a casual ""What's up,"" She said she didn't like me responding like that and asked me not to do it anymore because it made her feel insecure (I don't understand why). I told her I would try, but she needed to understand that it's something that could happen again since it's a greeting I do unconsciously. She insisted that I really try, and even though it wasn't something bad, I should understand her feelings and respect them. 
That's when I told her that she really needed to manage her insecurity, and there was nothing wrong with me saying that, that I had the right to do it if I wanted to. After that, she started crying, arguing that I should take care of her feelings without so much questioning, but frankly, I'm tired of giving in to these behaviors. I've changed a lot of what I say and do to the point where I'm starting to feel manipulated and frustrated.
I truly love this person, for many other reasons, and despite my actions, I'm starting to doubt if AITA (Am I the Asshole) for not keep being supportive as I’ve been, by “not taking care of her feelings"" anymore.

I talked to her, and gave her an ultimatum, after a long talk she accepted that she needed therapy and is willing to try it for the relationship, because I told her that it just wasn’t working out.

97,1cf9ttj,AITA for not paying my sister's tuition anymore??,"
I(24) have siblings (4f, 13f, and 19f), and they have lived with me for 5 years. And our mother is not mentally there. I didn’t even know of my youngest sister's existence until she was 2, and a family member expressed concern for her. That is just to give you an idea of how unstable my mom is.


My 19-year-old sister (let's call her Emmy) went to college in the fall. Financial aid had covered a really heavy fee, and it was left to me to cover about $6,000 after it, which didn’t seem too bad considering how much uni is without it, and I also agreed to give her $50  a month to sustain herself. I agreed to pay that money for my sister because, at the time, I really didn’t want her taking out any loans. I didn’t get the opportunity to go to college. I have been working since I was pretty young, and I had my siblings, so there was no way I could juggle a job that would sustain us and college.


Now my sister called me a few days ago and asked for a $100  to go out with her friend. I said I don’t have it. She got upset and said that the money I gave her was only enough for her sanitary supplies and she could barely eat out (she has a meal plan and a dorm). I told her for the fifth time to get a job. Guess what she told me after that...
She told me I wanted to ruin her college experience because I am uneducated and didn’t get the chance to go to college, so I am placing my anger on her because I am jealous of her.
We even argued for a hot minute, She Even asked me what I was spending my money on, and I asked her if she knew how much she knew it was to maintain our youngest sister. She said she was in school half the day. My younger sister is in daycare; public school is free, daycare is not. I need to work, and in order for me to work, I have to pay an outrageous amount to leave her in a daycare. Now Emmy is somehow unaware of this and is acting like taking care of three of them is a financially easy task. (Mind you, this is not the first time she is being selfish. I asked her to apply to be an RA so she could get free housing, but she didn’t even attempt to apply. (If she got rejected, I wouldn’t be upset, but she did not even turn in an application!!)


After arguing with her that what she said was selfish, I gave in and agreed with her. I told her I was so jealous that I was not going to pay for tuition ever again, and when she comes home, she can get a summer job to maintain herself or take out a loan. I don’t know why I am working myself thin and exhausting myself for someone who doesn’t even appreciate it. I told her I wasn’t joking and was dead serious and hung up. She sent me some apologies after.
Am I being an asshole and cutting her off (she will still always have a place in my home; I am not leaving her homeless), or is she just a teenager and am being childish?   


P.S I understand that me taking in my sibling was my choice but it wouldn’t hurt to receive some thanks for the amount of work I do for them. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-28,"AITA for not paying my sister's tuition anymore??

My (29 F ) sister Sam and John haven’t always gotten along, anyways I love with parents John sometimes come over and sleepover or something just passes by to spend time with us. My parents house has 3 restrooms 2 inside and one in the garage for me and my son since my brother also has his whole family living with him in his room (family of 5) they have the living restrooms and my parents have they’re own restroom, well since the winter I have been using my parents restroom to take my son and me a shower and get out, we’ve never had an issue. 

I would like to add I do not like the restroom in the living area for the reason that restrooms to me is dirty , since I moved in with my family I have never showered there , the only reason why I do not shower in my own restroom in the garage area is because there is no hot water during the winter, I only shower and get out again. 


John and I agreed on working on getting back together and I would only move out of my parents if he has a place for us and proposes. 

On a Saturday we were hanging out at my house we were planning on leaving to go to John house but I told John our son needed to shower he took the initiative to say he would take care of that for me not to worry, I told john would have to shower him in my mothers restroom, John showered him , I walked in with the towel and I just  pushed the door behind me , as I was taking my son out of the shower, John turned to the toilet to pee and I could hear Sam calling me loudly and before I knew it she walked in on John with his sausage in his hand using my parent’s restroom, sam said very loudly and annoyed eww , can’t y’all fucking close the door and John snapped back and said can’t you fucking knock? I was in the middle of it once again , I was filled with emotions I had no clue what I felt but I just began to cry. 

Sam says that John is getting to comfortable because of the way john spoke to her in her own parents house, I told  Sam should have never the eww comment it was unnecessary, if she could of just said can’t y’all fucking close the door , it’s understandable, I explained the fact that I was the last person to walk in and I had no clue he was going to pee till I was already in the shower getting my son out. 

Also when I spoke to Sam about this yesterday she says the she never made a comment and she down played her reaction to walking into the restroom. That really made so upset because she went and told our brother that lives there (28 M) and my brother told Sam he’s never had an issue with John while has been over but that he would of kicked John out of the house for speaking to her like that in our parents home.

Mary has always been there for me and I have been there for them, but the past few months, I feel like I am just someone to put the blame on. Like, I can't even show any emotion to them otherwise I'm the bad guy. So when Mary is stressed I used to offer things to distress them and keep them happy but recently its not been working and they just throw it in my face, so I've stopped offering help but no, I'm the bad guy for not helping when all I do is when they're here or not, is clean, do things to help around the house.

all of this is mostly whatever, annoying roomate get over it kind of a thing but i struggle with ocd and a large amount of the things he does makes me extremely uncomfortable and often panicked, 

which i get is a me issue but where the aita part comes in is ive asked him to at least try to lessen the behaviours that impact me badly (past the use by/moldy food and dirty counter/ stove top as it freaks me out severely about getting food poisoning and stuff and leads to me not eating and/or throwing out new food of mine that is probs perfectly fine but im worried is infected) and he hasnt changed a thing, if anything its gotten a bit worse!

i tried to have a firm but kind talk to him about it earlier- which ended up getting sort of heated and him telling me to just get over it and similar; where i yelled back at him about him being disgusting and selfish and ignorant for a solid 5 mins and he stormed out

thats where my dilemma comes in, am i just being whiny and overactive and did i go too far blowing up at him like that?

101,1cf8u3k,AITA for wanting to move from our home town for a better life for our kids? ,"AITA I want to move North, Wife refuses to think about it. 

I (34m) talked to my wife (33f) about moving north from our current town. 

We currently live in southern England, on the coast. We have 2 children M (13) and F (10).

They currently share a room as we have a 2 bedroom flat, rented, for £900 a month. The flat has no outside space or parking. 

I recently started a new job, completed my probation and got a pay rise to £28k per annum. My wife doesn’t work and we get some benefits worth around £1100 a month on top of my wages. 

The kids can’t share forever. I want to move to a 3 bedroom. But the prices in the area for those are £1400/£1600. Even with my wages we would need a gauruntor for the remaining and we would be barely scraping by after food and car costs. 

My work has a secondary office up north, outside Sheffield. I looked up the price for a 3 bed up there, with a garden, driveway and close to local schools and found a lovely one for £750 a month. I know work wouldn’t care which office I worked from. Even remote. 

We can’t afford to live in our home town. So I spoke to my wife about it. She shot the idea down straight away. Her reason is her ‘support network’ as she does have anxiety issues. She does choir practice, has a few friends, and all our family live close by. She doesn’t want to leave and I understand that. But the quality of life for our kids and ourselves will be better, a bigger house with more space, outside area for the summer, a drive for the car, extra money for holidays etc. 

When we moved to where we are now she hated it as she was further from her mom. By 30 minutes. We only see her mom once a month if that. The drive is around 4 hours each way from where I want to move. A lot but doable in a weekend each month if we wanted to. 

The last words my wife said on the subject before I went to do the weekly food shop, was if you want to go with the kids, go!

102,1cf8n01,AITA for treating my family better than treating my in laws?,"
My (F30) parents always put me above their wants and needs. They wanted to give me best opportunities. They invested in my education, took me on trips etc. At a point, when my father got some money at retirement, he put a major chunk that away for my wedding instead of doing anything for them. Knowing how much my parents did for me, I always dreamt of doing things for them when I had the means for that. 

When I started dating my now husband, all this had come up in our conversations. I had told him my plan was to set aside a set amount from my salary to do things with them. He was always positive about it. 

I went on several trips with my parents before my marriage. We got married over a year ago and last week I was planning another vacation with my parents coming comjng June. My husband saw this and asked if we could take his parents somewhere as well. I said sure and revised budgets and approximate accordingly. I went to discuss with him about how much it will cost and how much I needed him to put down. 

He seemed taken aback and asked if I didn't already have enough money to take our parents. I did have money saved up, but that was set aside for things for my parents only. If I took from that to fund trip for his parents also, I would be reducing what I can do for my parents. 

I asked if I took care of this entire vacation, would he be open to funding another vacation for my parents (the one balance money was for). He said no asking why my parents deserved an additional vacation as compared to his. 

It was frustrating to me and I said all this money I saved was earmarked for my parents. If I take from it to spend on his, he ought to compensate and spend on mine. He said I was showing partiality to my parents and not treating his parents as my own. 

So I told him while I have no qualms about having his parents come on the trip, I wouldn't be funding them. He is mad at me about this. 

Additional note just for full disclosure : I make more money than him, around twice. We contribute to our household expenses accordingly as well. We share all household expenses and has personal accounts for rest of the money. And we do take vacations just us during the year.

103,1cf8m50,WIBTA If I didn't share details of my pregnancy with my mum?,"Sorry for long post. I'm a 36F and don't have a good relationship with my mum. I recently finished therapy and they confirmed that my mum was my 1st abuser.
When I found out I was pregnant, my partner and me decided to wait to tell our family and friend as our last pregnancy sadly ended in a miscarrage. I told my family about a week ago and everyone was happy.
Recently my mum called me and I shared with her, I was having food cravings of Pineapple and Wheatabix. She came out with the old wives story that I was having a girl because I'm wanting savoury food. I told her that the midwife had said it is based on what my body needs. She dismissed this medical opinion and said she had proof as she had cheese when pregnant with me and my sisters. 
This did grate on my nerves as she often does this, dismisses all information and refuses to listen any opinion I have on a a subject if I haven't had first had knowledge/experience. This is normal for my mum, which is very toxic behaviour.
I decided to press on with call in a hope to end quickly and continue with making dinner. 
She then said she had picked up some wool. My friend's mum had already kindly asked me if she could make a knitted blanket. I really apperciated this and expressed it was kind of her. With this in mind I thought my mum had decided to make something for her grandchild (she doesn't know about my friend's mum offer) so I asked if she was planning to make something for grandchild and she said No. She had found out a friend was pregnant and was making something for her. 
*This really hurt me* I don't live close to her and I thought this was her way of helping out and showing support. She didn't even offer to make me something after something for her friend. I ended the call very quickly and talked how I felt about her actions with my partner.
I said I didn't want to share anymore with her now. I just felt it will upset and stress me out, something that could be bad for me. My partner agrees and supports my choice.

But I always feel horrible pushing my mum away. However some thing she says and does just hurt me.

  I (20f), have a small group of friends in college. All of them are special and have a place in my heart because I have been friends with them since middle school. But recently the girls started to change. They started making rude comments and jokes about me when we are all together even after I told them to stop. The jokes are mostly about me being a teacher's pet because I have the best grades and about my looks (I am dealing with some acne and they know that I am insecure about that, but are still talking about it). There still are some small issues but they are personal to me.
   So a week ago we were sitting on a bench outside and my classmate, that I will call P walked up to us. The girls gave him a seat near me and we started talking, after some chatting one girl started to say how nice we look together and pushed P so that he will be near me as much as possible. Another girl grabbed my head and started pushing me into P's face for us to kiss, all that while laughing and smiling. P has a girlfriend that watched the whole scene and was looking very sad, and I have a boyfriend. So after I pushed the girls, I saw that other people were looking at us. I felt so embarresd that I sprinted out to the toilet, closed myself inside a cabin and cried for a bit.After I calmed down I grabbed my stuff and walked home, all that while the girls commented that I'm a cry baby and an asshole.

Me and my roommates (24 Fs) live together since we are in grad school. One of my roommates recently got a new boyfriend (28 M) within the past couple months. He’s a nice guy, but me and my other roommate don’t really know him. 

To preface, me and my other roommate have our boyfriends over whenever we spare time. Me and my boyfriend are long distance and he is also in graduate school- so it’s probably every couple of months we see eachother.

Anyways, her and her boyfriend spend the entire weekend together. She began by asking the first time if he could come over to our apartment, in which he stayed for 3 nights.  But, now he’s been here for the past 5 weeks- 3 days out of the week. She no longer asks. He stays here, eats here, showers here, etc. He goes out while she stays here and comes back at late hours in the night, like 1:30 am. She also gave him our key once to lock up since we all had a appointment to get to, and didn’t tell us until we left for our appointment. Before coming back super late, I told her I do not want him to come back late and she agreed. However, she gets pretty salty if you say anything to her , from previous experiences.

AITA if I say something to her regarding this? If he’s going to be staying here this much because of some odd reason, I would have wanted to know before. But now it feels like we are in too deep in the issue for me to even say anything. I feel pretty disrespected and everything’s out of control.

This feature was one of the reasons I bought the specific backpack. Since it's very useful and even necessary while hiking.

G. got a little mad about it and said hopefully I never brake anything of his by accident. In the end he refused to pay for it and that was it.

I had been looking for a job for months.

She could not come with me because she have exams. My budget is also obviously very tight and it was the only available flight within my budget that would let me at least be there the day of her birthday.

It’s really important for her that I wish her happy birthday exactly at midnight. Problem is that my flight departed the night before her birthday but only arrived at 1AM. 

The flight was supposed to have wifi upgrade option and I payed for it, but for some reason it was not working (It was a low-cost company). I knew it was a risk, so just in case, I thankfully had set up an automatic message to her wishing her happy birthday with a beautiful and thoughtful message written in beach. I would have sent it myself if it was possible.

Now she is really mad that I wasn’t able to tell her happy birthday myself and is giving me a cold and avoidant attitude. I had actually bought her an expensive gift that I had been saving up for months and I also organized a date night at a fancy restaurant and bought flowers, while being unemployed, and now she does not even want to see me the day of her birthday and is giving me excuses.

Most of my friends are very understanding of my schedule, some even work in the same industry so they would never have any confusion.

I have this one friend in particular, he mentioned several weeks ago that he wanted to go out for drinks. I told him we could that Saturday night, but then a couple days after I made that plan I got invited to a surprise baby shower for that Saturday morning. It was about an hour away.

Cause those schools don't have teacher in that subject .
And all students have passed with good grades every time .

So people around me too got to know about it and cause I was unofficially not going to college.  I was asked to tutor children of family friends .3rd and 4th grade .

I agreed at no fees cause I was told it looks disrespectful to ask fees from people you know . And I was only teaching them for a month at most so I agreed . And the children are a menace.

. They even tell their family I did not teach them when my mind is blowing up teaching them .

And then if they do not well in test they tell that I did not teach them .

So I stopped teaching them and then I was asked to teach them during exams and another month so I did again cause everyone was continuously asking me too .

I was asked to teach them in may again and I said I will to calm them from asking me .

All names are fake for obvious reasons.
Some background:
In march of 2019 my(26m) mother(48f) di*d from heart attack in sleep. That was huge blow for my family... especialy for my father(55m) after 30y together
  
after 2 years my dad started develop drinking habbits, so my sisters agreed to make my dad tinder account and help him found someone.
  
after few months of searching for a good women, my dad got matched with Kate(50f) i wasn't happy at first that my dad found someone after my mom, but wasn't telling anything.
  
some months passed and i could say, that my dad(55m now) changed he stopped drinking so frequently and started drinking only on special occasions like birthdays, new year etc.
  
now, let's go forward another few months (it was december 2022). 
  
wee got asked by Kate to spend first christmas toghether with her family(her dughter Julia(20f), Mom-Anna(76f)) but my sisters(Martha(31f),Angie(29f)) weren't so happy about that.
  
They were thinking that our dad is spending too much time with Kate, so they told my dad that he should leave Kate. My dad pointed that both of them persuaded him to look for someone else, and after he found Kate they want him to be alone again,
  
there was huge fight between them, Angie told my dad, that this is his fault that our Mom is de\*d. After that they completly stopped talking, Martha took Angie side and i took my dad side(i was living with my parents when my mom died, i was in room above theirs when this happend)
  
i told her that i don't consider her my sister from now on, that she knows how much our parents loved each. after that i stayed in contact with Martha(this will be important later).

fast forward to january 2024:

now i leave alone in my dads house, he moved with Katy to their new house. Kate sold her house in another city, moved her Anna and Julia with them.

Next to the point where i ask this important question...

after 2years my Angie contacted me through Martha, 

She asked me to let her and her boyfriend move in with me ""just for few months"" (mind you, that after 3 months she can claim tenants right and i couldn't kick her out without court order)

because she needs to move out from her current apartment and don't have enough mony to rent another

i declined, saying, that she's no longer is considered family, and i won't let strangers to leave with me.

Angie said that this house is hers too.
  
I snaped and told her that everything is baiting her back right now and she's on her own and she should be thankful that i still paying her phone plan, that i could just kick her out from the package and she couldn't contact enyone because of blocked number.
Next day i called my dad and told him everything, dad said that i did right thing and she's not welcome in his house.

My friends and I are spread out across the country, and we like to meet up once a year or so for a long weekend. For context, Ross & Rachel are a couple, as are Chandler & Monica; Phoebe and I are both chronically single. This year, Phoebe booked a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house. The plan was for each “couple” to get a room, with me and Phoebe being the last couple. 

Phoebe had a last-minute emergency and couldn’t come, and admittedly, I was pissed. Not at her, but at the idea of fifth-wheeling the other two couples *again*. I’ve been single for a long time, not always by choice, and while my friends don’t rub it in my face, it still sucks to be surrounded by people deeply in love and when I don't have anyone to share it with.

I arrived first. The bedroom situation was weirder than it looked online—there was one massive master bedroom that took up half the upstairs, and it had its own private bathroom. Then, there were two much smaller bedrooms that shared an external bathroom. Since I arrived first and checked in, I took the big room.

Apparently, this was the worst thing in the entire world. Each couple had a small bedroom, and the four of them had to share one small bathroom, whereas I got an entire ensuite to myself.

I don't think it was fair that I should take one of the smaller bedrooms because I’m single. Phoebe booked everything, and I believe that whomever books and does the effort should get first dibs—she would’ve picked this room if she’d been able to come, and I would’ve bunked with her, therefore, I stayed in the big room anyway. Also, I shared my space as appropriate. Nobody slept with me obviously, but in the mornings, Monica came in to get ready with me or shower in my bathroom so that Rachel, Chandler, and Ross could use the other one. Nobody else asked or tried.

I could tell people were annoyed, but Ross was actively pissed. He said “when we went to XYZ, I shared a bunk bed with OP, because we were singles. I thought now that I have a girlfriend I might have earned the bigger bed.”

113,1cf7ea5,AITA for not paying hospital bills after my friend tripped over my dog?,"Yesterday my friends and I were hanging out in the park: me + my dog, my friend Cathy + her dog, and another friend Jenny. 

Jenny was walking Cathy’s dog, and they were walking ahead of us. Cathy was walking a bit behind me and my dog. Cathy decided that she wanted to catch up with Jenny, so she started running from behind me. 

As Cathy ran past me and my dog, she fell and tripped. We thought it was a minor injury but it turns out she dislocated her shoulder and needs surgery. Cathy says that while she was running past us, my dog suddenly ran toward her and she tripped over my dog. Honestly I didn’t see clearly how exactly she tripped. I couldn’t tell if my dog actually ran into her or if she tripped over my dog on her own. My dog didn’t make a sound and didn’t seem bothered. Jenny also said she couldn’t tell. 

Cathy wants me to pay her hospital bills because she says it’s my dog’s fault that she tripped. But I feel like it’s unfair of her to ask this. If my dog had bit her or attacked her, obviously that’d be a different story and I would 100% pay all the medical bills. But in this instance, Jenny and I are both unsure of whether my dog ran into Cathy, whether Cathy tripped over my dog, or whether Cathy tripped by herself near my dog.

She had been hooking up with someone and got pregnant but didn’t want it so instead of being able to talk about my pregnancy, she just wanted to talk about how awful and sick she felt going through her ab0rti0n - not long after that I miscarried but I couldn’t feel sad about it because she had lost her job - After 4 rounds of IVF I got pregnant again and of course something else happened, she broke up with her new bf and was inconsolable.

Three weeks have passed, and because of my end of the year exams, I couldn't apologise properly. I sent her a message 4 days ago, and she refuses to answer me at all.

119,1cf5kgc,AITA for not telling my family I got eloped ,"A year ago my husband (24 M) and I (24F) eloped after being together for 8 years. Before we got eloped we were planning a wedding, potluck style. My husband didn't really care for the wedding but he was willing to do it for me. The reason why he wasnt so caring for the wedding is because my husband's family isn't from this country, he only had 6 family members to invite and I had 82.

As I was preparing my wedding my dad tells me that the family is talking behind my back. My dad was visiting his sister when he heard she was on a facetime call with many of my dad's other siblings (my dad is 1 of 7). On the call they were saying that my wedding is gonna be ghetto, cheap, broke @ss, hillbilly trash because I didn't want to spend more than 20k and it was gonna be potluck. They also continued saying if they had to cook then they won't come, my dad got upset and asked her if they were talking about his daughter. They laughed and said ""yeah your daughter is an embarrassment"", my dad then told me all of this and said he fully supported what I wanted to do next.

After hearing this I was completely unmotivated to continue with the plans of a wedding. I told my parents that we will get eloped and they fully supported us. The following week we were at the altar with both sets of parents as witnesses.

Once the rest of the family found out everything erupted. It's been a year and my family still hasn't said congratulations. I got a hold of one of my aunt's and she told me how disappointed she was in me, I told her it wasn't fair on how the family it treating me since everyone else in the family has gotten eloped as well. She then called me selfish because I took the opportunity away from the family to have a reunion. All my aunts, uncles, and cousins have me blocked since I got eloped and refuse to talk to me and my parents. If you're wondering why they're ignoring my parents it's because they believe my parents shouldn't of gone to my elopement to support the family. AITA

My partner said they told others and they said the same thing I’m selfish. Now my part of the rent is coming out my paycheck not the money I got. I’ve also got things for my partner with the money. Anytime I go somewhere I always ask if they want something or I just get what they like. 
Now a little back story my partner has said I never give cash fyi I don’t carry cash. I went to the atm just to pull money out for them. In my mind I was doing a good thing getting the cash for them I wasn’t thinking just tell them I’ll cover this months rent.

128,1cf2w6t,AITA for asking my sister not to discuss her traumatic events with me?,"I (38F) have a sister (40F) going through a traumatic time.  She and the rest of my family live on the west coast while I live on the east coast.  Since everything has started to implode in her life, I have done my best to be there for her in any way I could, which most times is just chatting on the phone when she needs to vent. I have experience with what she’s going through and I can empathize with how awful it is.  Based on what she tells me, it seems like she has a pretty great support system there to help her out.  Family helps with childcare and going with her to places she doesn’t feel safe going alone.  All of this, I think is wonderful.  I’m glad she isn’t navigating all of it alone.  I’ve done my best to be understanding about her not getting back to me when she says she will, or not responding when I reach out, or stuff like that because I know, sometimes you don’t want to have a convo where you’ll get emotional or you’re drained from just dealing with it and you don’t want to be social at all.  I understand.  I try not to be too pushy or a pest so she can deal with what she needs to as she needs to without distractions.  

All that being said, I feel like when she does reach out to me, it’s because she’s exhausted everyone else and I’m a last resort for whatever reason.  As mentioned, I have been through what she’s going through.  I’ve offered advice, which she ignores.  Or she’ll call and be like “Aunt said this, and cousin said this, and dad said this…” so it’s fairly clear, she’s reaching out to just about everyone before she reaches out to me.  Which is kind of hurtful when I ask her to update me on important days, and then I don’t hear from her until a week or two later, and I guess she had time to update everyone else.  She called me crying one day because she had plans to get some important stuff done and had not been able to.  She was really upset about the set back.  I did some research and found out how to do it, which I sent to her, and told her I would pay for it as it can be really expensive.  She has enough on her plate without also straining finances.  I would have just done it but I didn’t have the info, so I also said, if you can get me the info I can just go in online and do it and pay or if you do it, just let me know the amount and I’ll Zelle it immediately.  I’m doing my best to be supportive and helpful even though I’m so far away.  As far as I know, she never did what she had been trying to and she ran out of time to have what she needed by when she needed it.  I offered to come out and stay with her for a bit since my income won’t change.  She had no interest in that.  Just ignored the text when I brought it up. 

Our last convo was me saying it seems like she has a ton of people to vent to, I don’t like being ignored, and it’s a waste of time to seek solutions for problems she clearly doesn’t want solutions for, she has plenty of shoulders to cry on and ears to listen.  It may have been too harsh.

129,1cf2u92,AITA for being petty/mad that I wanted to go home early,"My boyfriend 23M and I 23F have been together for about 2 years. 

I have recently started to make my friends. But most of my past friendships came about through him. Usually, it's another couple and we all become friends. 

A couple that we are friends with invited us to a party. I wasn't going to attend because I had to work the day of and thought I would be drained. I ended up going with him as a DD. We planned ahead of time that we would not stay long, so about 2 hours. I also had to work early the next day. I wanted to go and he wanted me to come, rather than him going alone. 

So we get to the party, the first ones there around 7:20 pm. Per the invite the party started at 6 pm, we let them know I would be late because of work. Other people start to show up around 8:30-9 pm (very late). So he asked what time we would be leaving because he was “worried about me” since I had to work in the morning. I decided 10 pm would be good. So 10 starts to creep up and he doesn't seem like he wants to leave. So he begins to joke that we are about to leave and his friends say come back (after he takes me home). He says yeah I'll come back sarcastically and then says to me  “I'm not coming back I'm sleeping with my woman tonight” (loud enough for others to hear). 

They convince him to let me leave and Uber home later. He walks me out asking if this is okay & what I want him to do. I let him decide
 to stay or come home on his own. I didn't want him to feel guilty about staying and having fun but at the same time, I had hoped he chose to come home. He didn't, he stayed and I drove home alone. Before I left he said I'll be there later to go to bed with you. I get home and go to bed.

130,1cf2i8b,AITA for not wanting to attend the opening ceremony for my father's newest venture,"So I (20F) is the only child of my parents. My father, who is an ambitious businessman had decided to open his newest venture. It was the day before the ceremony that I came to know that the venture is to be named after me. I also overheard my parents talking about how they'll make me do the presiding. Although it is a great privilege to have a venture named after myself and to inaugurate it, it just did not sit right with me. They never informed me of the procedures nor did they ask me for my consent to use my name for public display. Probably because they knew that I'd never agree to it. I later complained about it to my mother but she said that I should be glad to have this privilege.



The thing is, I was never particularly close to my father. It was my mother who looked after me all through childhood and teen years. My father on the other hand was barely around. He did not involve himself in my affairs. My mother used to pay for my education with her hard earned money. Which is very rare for a woman to do so when their husband's working. I have heard from my mother that he had denied paying for my education as he had no money on him. No money and yet he had enough to spent it on his many ventures. This and due our obvious lack of bond, made me question as to why he would let me do the presiding for such an important event.



Not to mention that I have severe social anxiety and a hard time being around large crowds. This was a very well known fact among everyone in my family and yet they  ordered me to go. During the morning of the event, I claimed that I had the right to make the decision as to whether or not I would attend the event and therefore won't be attending it. This caused a ruckus until finally, I was forced to come along. I was then told by my family that I was spoiled and ungrateful for behaving the way I did. And the fact that I had refused to attend the opening for a venture that my father named after me showed that I was a cold hearted person. But as a grown woman of 20 I think I do have the right to refuse it or am I the asshole here?

Now my bro is fairly heavy footed behind the wheel at the best of times though i never see it as an issue worth critiquing, however, on this occassion he was tailgating the car in front dangerously close and feeling like we were being put at risk I said to him ""there is no reason for you to be riding this guys ass like this dude"" his retort was to say ""you don't get to tell me how to drive in my car"" to which I responded something like ""nah, I'm standing my ground here, you are putting us and the people in front at risk for literally no reason, just hang back man, driving isn't a game"" he got pissed at this point and got even closer to the car in front to prove a point or some shit, I told him he was being immature and he started yelling some shit about me being arrogant and thinking I'm always right when I rarely am, how I'm immature because I make less money than him (irrelevant but true) and that I should have taken my car if I wanted a say on his driving.

On the way there I told him that one of the couples that would be there were coworkers of mine and to keep his conversations PG-13 around them. (When he gets around another man that I knew was going to be there they often loudly make inappropriate jokes and comments about sex, jerking off, drugs, etc). When everyone was being introduced he immediately says to the couple, “oh you’re the ones she said I have to behave around” and everyone laughed it off and it was fine. He made a couple of comments that were toeing the line of inappropriate but he never went overboard and everyone seemed to have a good time. 

After the party we decide to go grab dinner on the way home and after ordering I notice my coworkers are at the same restaurant and must have come in after us. My husband wanted to go run over and say hi and join them but I thought we should let them enjoy their meal and then stop by the table on the way out to say hi again. About 10 minutes later the wife comes up to us and says that she just spotted us and small world and all of that and my husband says “yeah we saw you too but she said I shouldn’t say anything to you!” at which point the coworker was like “did I get snubbed?!!” she laughed but it felt kinda awkward and she went back to the table. 

After she left I calmly told him that it makes me uncomfortable when he tells people things I’ve said about them so he can get a laugh and it feels like a violation of trust and he apologized but the apology felt disingenuous like he just wanted the conversation to be over.

It takes roughly an hour to get to the airport, and I wanted to be there 1.5h before the flight there (no checked in luggage so it usually only takes me ~30/40 min) so we decided to wake up at 5am to leave at 5.30am.

Now, we both knew and agreed tho this.

Morning comes, the alarms ring, and we wake up. My bf gets up very quickly and goes out of the room without saying anything. I hear him go to the study to continue setting up a laptop.he started doing last night before we went to sleep. Now, normally we wake up, cuddle, then get ready and leave. So I call to him ""hey, don't you want to cuddle?"" He shouts back yes and comes to bed. We snuggle, all is good. 5.22, I'm slowly starting to get ready (took a shower the night before so I wouldn't have to in the morning) so I just needed to get dressed in my pre-planned outfit, takes me only around 2 minutes
Again, 5.22 he asks me again, what time do we want to leave? And I respond, 5.30, like we said.

He goes to take a shower. I'm.thinking oh this will be close, I remind him what the time is at 5.28 and 5.30, starting to stress out a bit. He keeps saying yes I'm.comkng out, gets out at 5.32 and then gets ready. We got in the car around 5.40, so 10 minutes after we agreed.

Now, 10 minutes is not a lot and usually would be okay, it's the fact that on our way there was a crash and   we were stuck in traffic for forever, not sure exactly how long. I get to the airport with 26 minutes till my flight takes off, run through the airport to get to my gate and be told it just closed, less than 5 minutes before I got there. Its 7.51am. 

Now, his point of view is that even if he didn't get ready late we mightve still been stuck in the traffic even longer. That's true, but I think we would've been at the front of it so I'd still have the extra 10.minutes. 

Another thing is, he's upset im blaming him for driving late. He says, that he did get up at 5 but I called him back to bed to cuddle. I said to him that that's true, but he knows the time we want to leave by so if he wanted to take a shower (which I didn't know about) it's up to him to get up and cut the cuddling short if he knows he needs more time getting ready. I don't think it's my fault just because I asked if he wanted to cuddle, I feel like if I knew I still needed to shower I'd cuddle for a bit and get up in time to shower and get ready by the time we agreed on, however he doesn't see it that way.

I know this whole situation would've been completely irrelevant if not for the traffic jam, but the 10 extra minutes would've been the make or break in this situation for me. 

Maybe im just stubborn and can't see that it is partially my fault for us leaving late, like he says. I just think it's not up to me to make sure he gets up and ready on time.

136,1cf1wt1,AITA for not wanting my ex husbands baby mama near our children.,"So for a bit of background.. me 26f and my ex husband 28m spilt up in June and got divorced in December of last year, after finding out that he had been having an affair with my best friend 28f. 


She had been going through a divorce herself and i really didnt thank that they would stoop so low, but it happened and i found out on the day of our youngest daughter's birthday..

However she would gaslight me into thinking i was imagining things and telling me she would never want to be in a relationship with him, while telling him they needed to go look at houses together while I'm in the same room as them(i was getting the rest of my belongings). 

They started their relationship within a week of me moving out... During the months from June to December, both of them were incredibly nasty towards me and threatened to take away my daughters 9f and 3f because I'm unstable because of my depression. 


I found out the she was pregnant after them being together for 5 months, and then they split up because she attacked my ex husband in front of the children. Although she claimed she was certain my ex was the father there was a time in which she wasn't sure and wanted to raise the baby on her own. 

But about a month ago she got back in touch with my ex husband and they have become close again... 

So where the issue comes in is i dont want her around my children as she has often told them that she will be their new mommy because she is pregnant with their baby sister and that daddy loves her more than he loved mommy and she will be a better mommy for them when they get married... 

She has also had my children lie to me when they are spending weekends at their dad's place by telling them to tell me she wasn't there and that i will lose my temper with them if they told me she was ( I've always assured my daughters that i wont be angry with them if they tell me the truth in regards to that and that my ex and his baby mama is in the wrong)

I dont want that woman around my children regardless of her being pregnant with their half sister yet my ex husband thinks im being unfair towards her because she has ""changed""

137,1cf1qds,AITA for asking for money back that I paid for a concert I can no longer go to ,"I (19 f) paid my cousin (19 f) almost $400 for a concert she planned. Context: Our family has a long history of stealing from eachother. There’s been periods of time where I went no contact due to her breaking my trust, but we were younger so I set it aside as juvenile issues. But I am now starting to question whether or not I should have ever broken no contact. 

She posted on her Snapchat story a few months ago asking if anyone wanted to go to a concert for an artist I am a huge fan of and was dying to see. So I said I would love to go and asked her about every little detail she could give me so I could make sure 100% I’d be able to go and wouldn’t run into any issues (this is important to know) 

She told me that everyone would have to pay for the ticket, the gas to get there, the hotel we’d be staying at, and for food. The last part I found slightly odd because we could all just pay for our own food while there, but again I decided to trust her. She had a note in her phone keeping track of how much money everyone had sent her, because instead of us all setting money aside we have all been sending it straight to her.

Over the span of the last few months I checked in weekly for information about the concert, where we were going, how much I had left to pay, what days I needed to request off, etc. I tried to avoid every little road bump that could cause us not being able to go. When I originally asked her what days we’d be gone so I could request off and have the time off guaranteed, she told me May 23rd-25th. She claimed we would drive there on the 23rd and back on the 25th. She asked if I would be willing to drive at any point and I told her I would do whatever’s needed no problem.

 The concert is now in less than a month (25 days) and she reached out to me two days ago to tell me that the plans have changed and my heart sunk. The company I work for needs pto to be put in months in advance which is why I asked months ago what time I needed off. I voiced to her that I was frustrated and that I understood it was difficult planning something like this on your own, but I asked for all this info months ago to make sure I’d be able to go. 

I told her I would no longer be able to go because I can’t change the time I requested off. We had a very heated discussion that she handled very immaturely (I will go into more detail in the comments) and because of the way she handled it I told her I would need my money back before the concert which is in 25 days. I know she is planning on using the money I sent her for the concert and I told her I worked really hard for that. She originally agreed but is now saying that she can’t pay me the 225 I paid for the ticket, because she would be losing money. She said that it’s my ticket and if she can’t sell it she’d can’t pay me back. AITA for asking for my money back due to her poor planning?

We don’t usually attend parties together as we have kids and if we go out it’s usually dinner and an activity etc. She’s understandably very excited, she’s hyper anyway but tonight is overly hyper and excitable and generally not a version of her I see, ever, so already I don’t really know how to act around this different version of her. She introduced me to 2/3 people and instantly ran off out of sight, I sat down with our drinks near her friends with seats sat in a line rather than round a table. Obviously people are drinking and the majority of the 40+ people I don’t know. I’m talking to people and trying to enjoy myself but ultimately it’s not my sort of environment, I don’t know most people and I feel uncomfortable but I’m trying my best. My partner all the while is running here and there talking to people, singing karaoke etc, totally fine I want her to enjoy herself. I’m sort of sat on my own which I’m totally fine with. She eventually comes over to me and is talking to me/her friends but I can tell she’d rather be elsewhere and is forcing a conversation with me bcos she feels bad. Again, I don’t really know this version of her so I don’t know why she’s on edge round me.

I say we don’t have to enjoy the same things, I’m not asking her to leave with me.

(Like that’s my fault, when she’s admitted she is OTT around other people) which I just find hurtful. All in all it ended with us leaving together and her ranting at me the whole way home about how she’s right and this is all my fault. Honestly, I just think that I accept her for everything she does, out the house most nights while I run things at home and just want her to be happy in whatever she does, but she’s expecting me to act a certain way to make her feel better.

We coordinate our playing schedules so we can experience the plot twists and endings as a group. It's a great way for us to bond, especially since we all love discussing and theorizing about the stories as we go.

I confronted Dave about it, and he just laughed it off, saying it's just a game and we were taking it too seriously. Given that this isn't the first time Dave has shown a lack of regard for group rules (though the first for a major spoiler), I decided to ban him from the group to prevent future disruptions.

141,1cf19w0,AITA for 'excluding' my cousin's gf from my birthday party,"I'll be celebrating my 20th birthday with my family next week. I was really excited about it until this all happened, causing a huge situation where everyone from my family is telling me I'm in the wrong, while my friends insist I'm right. So, I decided to take it to Reddit.

When we were chatting in the family group chat to figure out who can make it (I have a really large family, by the way), my aunt texted, ""Hey, can Sarah come too?"" It took me a minute to even realize who she was talking about. Then I realized it's my cousin's girlfriend. The reason I didn't recognize the name is because they've only been dating for a little over a month, and I've never met her.

Something important to note here is that I'm on the spectrum, and unknown factors really stress me out. I'm sure she's a really lovely girl, but I don't know her. I know it will stress me out, so I don't want her at my party.

I texted my mom this, she read it but didn't respond. At this point, I'm really starting to stress out about it, so I privately messaged my aunt and said, ""Hey, Sarah is cousin's girlfriend, right? If I can be completely honest, because I myself haven't met her yet, I'd prefer it if she didn't come. I hope that's okay.""

I texted my mom letting her know I took care of the situation myself and sent her my message as well. She called me the next morning, telling me how what I did was incredibly rude, how it's mean of me to exclude this girl, how she's just a part of the family now, and then she drops the ""well I texted your aunt letting her know Sarah can come.""

I know to some, this might seem incredibly trivial, but to me, it's a really big deal. To quickly put it into perspective, imagine having a birthday party and your family suddenly texts you, ""Hey, is it okay if we make it spider themed?"" And you tell them that you have a phobia of spiders and how that would be incredibly stressful for you, and they go, ""Yes, but we like spiders, so it doesn't really matter.""

So when my mom said that, I panicked and got angry. I told her, ""Well, if that's the case, you can hold it without me because I will not be coming,"" and hung up. I know that was an overreaction, but it's just this whole situation that rubs me the wrong way. My mom knows I struggle with these kinds of things, so to then not even listen to me and just go over my head really stings.

Now that side of the family is upset with me, my mom hasn't talked to me, and I don't know what to do. My friends, though, agree with me and think it's unreasonable that I don't have a say about it at my own party. I still don't think I'm in the wrong.

I texted my mom this, she read it but didn't respond. At this point, I'm really starting to stress out about it, so I privately messaged my aunt and said, ""Hey, Sarah is cousin's girlfriend, right? If I can be completely honest, because I myself haven't met her yet, I'd prefer it if she didn't come. I hope that's okay.""

I texted my mom letting her know I took care of the situation myself and sent her my message as well. She called me the next morning, telling me how what I did was incredibly rude, how it's mean of me to exclude this girl, how she's just a part of the family now, and then she drops the ""well I texted your aunt letting her know Sarah can come.""

I know to some, this might seem incredibly trivial, but to me, it's a really big deal. To quickly put it into perspective, imagine having a birthday party and your family suddenly texts you, ""Hey, is it okay if we make it spider themed?"" And you tell them that you have a phobia of spiders and how that would be incredibly stressful for you, and they go, ""Yes, but we like spiders, so it doesn't really matter.""

So when my mom said that, I panicked and got angry. I told her, ""Well, if that's the case, you can hold it without me because I will not be coming,"" and hung up. I know that was an overreaction, but it's just this whole situation that rubs me the wrong way. My mom knows I struggle with these kinds of things, so to then not even listen to me and just go over my head really stings.

Now that side of the family is upset with me, my mom hasn't talked to me, and I don't know what to do. My friends, though, agree with me and think it's unreasonable that I don't have a say about it at my own party. I still don't think I'm in the wrong. So Reddit, AITA?",0.0,-0.0003542581107467413,0,1

He did not know about it and we ended up spending time together watching a videomapping, followed by a concert, fireworks and a drone lightshow (both of us have never seen one in person before).

I 25(F) recently went on a week trip with my boyfriend and to my surprise my parents were okay with it and what not. Throughout the entire trip, my family barely even called me or text me so I got the hunch that no one missed me since I was sending pictures and videos often and hardly anyone was responding. My family is not keen on showing affection, so it is hard to tell if they truly missed me or not. Plus, I was enjoying my time away from home since the past couple of months have been nothing but stress. Dreading coming home to this stress and an unwelcoming environment, I called my mom the night before my landing just to catch up on how things are going, and told her I wasn’t going to be home until midnight on the day I landed back home. I wanted to go on a hike with a few friends and I figured since they were in the area, why not go visit them after the airport. She said this was okay but she also said that she was cooking a home cooked meal for me upon my arrival. I politely thanked her and asked if she can move it to the following day since me and my other siblings will be home then. She said okay, and ofc this gave me the green light that I was good to go hang out with my friends.

When I got home that night, I was met with an unhappy mom and a dad that barely looked up from his phone that he was watching. He looked up once to say “oh hi” but that was about it. He isn’t generally affectionate so this is normal of him. My mother, on the other hand, started complaining about how disrespectful it was for me to be away for a week, and while she had been looking forward to my arrival, i decided to not come straight home from the airport to hang out with friends.

Anthony said once while we were talking on a Messenger video call that he would like to have two kids or one, but my friend Gabby said she don't want kids. 
I fully understand that not all girls want to have children and I agree with that.  But did I need to know that, I have no idea.

My friend also played this game with me. She showed me some kind of box in the camera and asked: What's here?  
I didn't say anything because I just didn't know what to say and she said that there were condoms in that box.

In another situation, she simply showed her home even though I told her not to do that.  She sends me pictures of her and her boyfriend or tells me to look at her Facebook profile.

Since then, sadly, she has shown herself to be someone I wouldn't ever room with again, or probably stay in contact with. Much less go on a bucket list adventure with. 

Long story short, she basically is never around and I am forced to take care of her cat that she neglects. Clean his litter, feed him (and I do it happily for the cat otherwise he would literally starve), but he's clearly been anxious about her being away so much and has stopped using the litter box and is pooping in my ROOM... and when I brought it up to her, her solution was for me to ""watch my step"" because there was nothing she could do about that. Yes, I was floored. Just blatant disrespect. For me and for her own cat. It's sad. That, along with the fact that the only thing I asked of her courtesy-wise was to give me a heads-up when she was bringing a guy over. Since she is single and dating and bringing many of them over every weekend. She did that for the first couple of weeks, then stopped giving me a heads-up completely and sneaks them in.

(...lol) Part of me also wants to enjoy the trip with my LD boyfriend, who I've been dating for 5 years, and haven't seen in 4 months. Yes, I know I shouldn't have invited her in the first place... but I did :(

Kay makes a comment and says,”Me and Lynn could match and you can wear a jumpsuit”. I instantly felt excluded because if its themes, “tripplets” why would they match and I wear something else? Now Im not a fan of dresses and everyone knows that but I would have thought if the plan was to match we could find something that we all can agree on.

He would text me everyday, all day. He eventually told me he liked me over snap. I thought I liked him too, so I said that. We went to the movies, he held my hand. This was very awkward, because we can barely talk in person. Everything was just very awkward and made me very uncomfortable. About a week ago, I went to his house again to watch some shows, he held my hand again. I prayed over and over and over again to let me leave early because of how uncomfortable I was. I ended up having to stay like that for an hour.

He also kept showing how insecure and immature he was. He would constantly “test” me to see if I would text first. I realized I didn’t like him, but I was two months into this whole thing. 

I’m a very busy person, and so the last few days I’ve been setting up ending it by saying how busy and stressed out I’ve been. Today during our shift, I said “ you’ve probably noticed how busy I’ve been, I think I’m too busy for a relationship right now. I think it’s best that we stay friends for right now.” he just said okay and turned off his mic. We spent the rest of the shift in silence. He cut me off before I could say anything else and explain that I’m very busy. 

I sent him “Hey, I just wanted to say sorry that it was pretty awkward tonight. I wanted to talk to you in person because I think it’s pretty crappy to do that over text. I was trying to be honest about where I’m at. You’re really nice, and I’m glad I got to know you. Again, I’m sorry that I made the shift awkward.” He responded lol we’re all good. a few minutes later, he sent a very long paragraph. He was basically saying that I hurt him, I led him on, he accused me of not liking him the whole time, he said I switched it up as soon as I got stressed, he said we all get stressed, “welcome to adulthood,” told me I’m like all the other women he’s ever met and thought I would be different, just a lot of crap. It really hurt me, but I didn’t respond with anything because I didn’t wanna be petty. I just thought he was nicer than this.

I did think that I might have been leading him on a bit and I felt terrible about the whole thing. I understand why I might be the AH. I think I let things get too far and didn’t tell him about my uncertainty with my feelings.

TLDR; I didn’t keep her updated about if I was writing an exam or deferring, and she refused to tell me why she was upset until the end of the argument. 

The next morning, she texted my boyfriend of 6 months (M18) to “tell me immediately” if I’m writing my exams as depending on this she would come and surprise me. He was uncomfortable doing so, and then she changed her request to be to call her on Tuesday with an update. 

My issue with this is that to me, it feels like she’s using a second person to get around our communication issue. She insists that this is not the case and she simply wanted to surprise me. 

Throughout my life, whenever my mother would have a conflict with someone, she would try and drag outsiders into the conflict. This is a behaviour that scares me because this could easily cause “outsiders” to be fed up, and no longer associate with the person dragging them into conflict. I don’t want the people Im closest to  to leave me because of her. 

Although I have accepted that using a second person to get around our communication issue may not have been her intention, my main issue was that I didn’t want her to think that it is okay to drag other people into our conflicts in the future. So, during the past 3 weeks, I’ve expressed this to her many times, calmly and clearly, as well as angrily, and her response was that I was disrespectful, manipulative, ungrateful, and that I have no right to give her an ultimatum (“do not get other people involved in our issues”).

160,1ceyv2a,"AITA For Showing A Picture Of Me With My Stepsister's ""Deadbeat Dad""?","Throwaway Account because people who know me in real life know my main.

I (30f) have a stepsister ""Betty"" (28f) and we do NOT have a good relationship. I am my parents only child together and my dad had full custody of me growing up. I love my mom and she's a good person and we have a decent relationship, but if she could do it all again my mom would definitely be childfree. 

Betty on the other hand was raised solely by her mom because her ""dad"" isn't really her dad because her mom lied about Betty's paternity. Betty's dad found out when about her mom's infidelity when she was 6, had Betty tested, filed for divorce when Betty turned out to not be his, and ceased all contact with Betty by the time she was 8. Instead of getting Betty into therapy Betty's mom thought getting her a new paternal figure would fix everything and my dad was the type who wanted the title of ""father"" but not have to do any actual childrearing so Betty's mom and my dad thought that this would be a good set up for everyone. 

Except it sucked for me. Betty's mom obviously favored her own child and looking back on it I would say Betty resented me for having a dad who ""wanted them.""

We met and dated in high school and decided to do the long distance thing. At least I was.   
  
I found out when my dad took me on a one-on-one dinner and explained how Betty and Mark were in love and expecting a baby, and that I had three months to be upset and then never talk about it again.

This was a two-day conference/convention type of thing and he and I became semi-buddies. On the final day he and I (plus 5 other people) took a group photo together and I was right next to him. I posted the picture and captioned it ""When you meet a new friend who's also a great dad"" on Betty's birthday.

",TL;DR,2024-04-28,"AITA For Showing A Picture Of Me With My Stepsister's ""Deadbeat Dad""? Throwaway Account because people who know me in real life know my main.

I (30f) have a stepsister ""Betty"" (28f) and we do NOT have a good relationship. I am my parents only child together and my dad had full custody of me growing up. I love my mom and she's a good person and we have a decent relationship, but if she could do it all again my mom would definitely be childfree. 

Betty on the other hand was raised solely by her mom because her ""dad"" isn't really her dad because her mom lied about Betty's paternity. Betty's dad found out when about her mom's infidelity when she was 6, had Betty tested, filed for divorce when Betty turned out to not be his, and ceased all contact with Betty by the time she was 8. Instead of getting Betty into therapy Betty's mom thought getting her a new paternal figure would fix everything and my dad was the type who wanted the title of ""father"" but not have to do any actual childrearing so Betty's mom and my dad thought that this would be a good set up for everyone. 

Except it sucked for me. Betty's mom obviously favored her own child and looking back on it I would say Betty resented me for having a dad who ""wanted them.""

161,1ceyoxz,AITA Feeling frustrated at my wife. ,"Lately we have been visiting my in-laws about once every week or babysitting her niece and dropping her off to her parents/grandparents house. Granted, she often visits them during the weekday when she has a gap from work also. Since we bought a house, we live about 45 minutes away from her family, and I get it, she has a close bond with her family but it hasn’t always been like that, especially when she lived with them. The drives are tiring and we usually have a really unproductive day of just lounging around. 

Even though it is tiring, I power through it if it makes her happy to see them. There was one time when I’ve openly communicated this to my wife that sometimes I do want to visit her in-laws that often or babysit her nieces on the weekends because there are times where I would want to either visit my family or set out the time to work on chores around the house, work on a business idea that we had come up with, or just have a weekend to relax from work. 

When I first opened up to her she got upset and left the room. When I brought up the conversation again it seemed like we found some common ground and understanding of my side of my feelings. 

However, it seems like nothing has been understood and we are continually going through this same routine and it’s just been draining. She sees that I get frustrated but does nothing about it.

I also feel like I’ve done a lot for her family over the years, but I wouldn’t want to get into the weeds here. 

I’m at the point where I feel like I just keep giving and giving my time and love but nothing ever feels like I get any appreciation back. I guess this is what we do for love? We adapt and adjust? Sacrifice our happiness?

I think they’re really cute together, and I do like his boyfriend and I think he treats my best friend well (as he should.) I thought they were both really emotionally mature and seemed to be in a healthy relationship. 

The only slight red flag is my best friend told me he gets jealous, but in a cute way.

We were talking about a game we use to play, we would rate guys together. I jokingly said it might be weird for us to do that now. He said no, no, but his boyfriend is his only 10/10, everyone else is inferior.

His bf laughed at that. I said “sure, but you’ve always dated hot guys. A lot of your boyfriends were hot. Didn’t stop you from giving other men the 10 rating.”

He looked at his bf and said, “I mean, they were cute, but no one compares to my bf. There’s a reason we’re together.”

His bf awkwardly said “no, it’s okay.” I said “yes, it is okay. Of course he’s not the hottest guy you’ve dated. I’m sure he knows that.” 

My best friend said I was tryna create problems, I said not at all. It’s basic logic, of course you’ll have dated hotter guys. It’s egotistical to think you’re better than everyone else. 

No offense, but my best friend is hot. And I’m not lying, his past bf’s were all really hot. So is his current, though.

When his bf left he said I was acting an asshole and making things awkward. He said he really likes this one. He pictures a serious future and told me to shut the fuck up.

I was thrown off. I didn’t think I was acting an asshole, just pointing out common sense.

I’ve gotten to the point where it annoys me. Like she asked me to borrow one today. She starts her period at this time of the month every month. 

I asked why she didn’t remember to bring them and she looked shocked. She said she forgot. I told her to use toilet paper. She told me she can’t she’ll bleed through it. I said I was tired of giving her tampons, I’ve loaned her out a bunch. I always remember to bring mine,
why can’t she? 

She said I was being a shit friend. She asked if I was seriously not going to give her one, I said I was serious and she’d figure it out without me. I’m not always going to be around, she can’t always rely on me. It seems to me she forgets her stuff on purpose because she knows I’ll always bail her out.

He has a brother Dario(21), that also has a 2year old daughter, Rene with his girlfriend Kelly(20). Recently they came to me to ask if I would be willing to babysit their daughter for a week during the school holidays as their normal babysitter (Renes maternal grandma) is going on holiday and they don't have the funds for a babysitter.

I told them I don't feel comfortable looking after Rene as I have never babysat her before and only ever spend time with her at family gatherings,etc. They tried to convince me by telling me I have the time and it would be good for the girls to spend more time with one another.

I still said no. I am planning on going away for two weeks including the week they want me to babysit to visit my sister in a city 4hours away. They said I could take her with. I still said no, I will be staying at my sisters house and although it has the space I am not inconveniencing her by bringing a child she doesn't know to her house. She also WFH so I would be going to other family members nad friends I haven't seen in a year the first 3 days we are there since she will be working those days.

Having my daughter to travel with will be exhausting enough, I do not have the energy for another child. They have been blowing up my phone and included MIL in the argument. She is taking their side as Dario is her golden child and Rene is definitely her favourite grandchild.

I got fed up and said maybe MIL should take some personal vacation days to babysit her grandchild instead of forcing me to do it.

They tried to get Darios aunts and uncles involved but they are all on my side as I am closer to them and told them exactly why I didn't want to babysit.. I am now being called an a\*\*hole who doesn't think of anyone else by MIL, BIL and his girlfriend.

During the breakup, Steph read all my text messages with my two best friends (Jen and Allie, both 31f). Jen and Allie were both supporting me and angry at the way I was being treated, but my girlfriend got mad that they were saying she was emotionally abusive. My ex Steph now hates both of them and it made our break up even messier. Steph got mad at me even when Jen and Allie’s names would show up on my watch so I had to hide and delete most of their calls and texts for weeks.

When I was trying to move out, I was really stressed out about finding a place while dealing with my breakup so I verbally agreed to move in with one of my best friends (Jen) since she lives nearby in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate moving out soon, and was set to renew her lease. She renewed for a year, but her roommate wouldn’t be able to move out for a few months so I got a short term lease for a 1 bedroom apartment on my own until her place would be available.

Now that I’m on my own, I love living by myself and don’t want to give it up. A part of me is also afraid that living with Jen would ruin my chances of getting back together with Steph because Steph hates Jen now.

I ended up telling Jen that I won’t be moving in with her when the apartment is available. I offered to help Jen post to find someone to replace me, but she refused because she doesn’t want to live with a stranger since she was initially going to live alone.

Jen is really pissed at me now, and asked me to help pay the fee to break the lease, which is two months rent ($8000). She is expecting that I pay half, $4000. I don’t think I should have to pay any part of the fee because I didn’t sign anything.

168,1cey03b,AITA for not letting my in-laws see my children every weekend?,"My wife (36) and I (29) have 1 year old twin boys and my in-laws have been very involved since day 1. They lived at my house for 3 months last year helping out and stayed over every weekend last summer. And now are over every weekend (just one day at least). And at least 2-3 FaceTimes a week with the boys as well as almost nightly phone calls with my wife about the boys. AND a shared photo album app where we upload pictures of the boys and they all comment on them. And if they miss a week, yk for certain they’ll be over the next weekend. 

My in-laws also don’t listen to us when it comes to handling our kids. We have certain ways we want to feed/raise/play with them and they do not listen to us when we tell them to stop doing this or don’t do that. “I’m the grandma I get to do whatever I want and it always is with good intentions and that’s all that matters”.  So when they’re over, it’s not exactly a stress-free environment.

So when they recently did not come over on a weekend because my wife said that she didn’t want them over I thought maybe we could work towards maybe less time with them coming over. The last time we went more than one weekend not seeing them was when they were away this past October. Otherwise, it’s been just about every weekend or every other weekend since late 2022. 

I told my wife that I am feeling overwhelmed, uncomfortable and suffocated by how often her parents are over and I wish we could cut down on their visits to maybe once a month or at least not so rigidly scheduled. She did not like that and got mad at me. She said that her parents not going to be around forever and it’s important for the boys to have a relationship with their grandparents. I clarified for her that it’s not that I don’t want her parents in my children’s life. I just want some “alone” time with my wife & kids and maybe see my side of the family.

My wife is very close with her family. If I’m being honest, I think a little too close. But
I don’t think I’m being unreasonable.

",Not the A-hole,2024-04-28,"AITA for not letting my in-laws see my children every weekend? My wife (36) and I (29) have 1 year old twin boys and my in-laws have been very involved since day 1. They lived at my house for 3 months last year helping out and stayed over every weekend last summer. And now are over every weekend (just one day at least). And at least 2-3 FaceTimes a week with the boys as well as almost nightly phone calls with my wife about the boys. AND a shared photo album app where we upload pictures of the boys and they all comment on them. And if they miss a week, yk for certain they’ll be over the next weekend. 

My in-laws also don’t listen to us when it comes to handling our kids. We have certain ways we want to feed/raise/play with them and they do not listen to us when we tell them to stop doing this or don’t do that. “I’m the grandma I get to do whatever I want and it always is with good intentions and that’s all that matters”.

My ex was cheating a doing a lot behind my back to not get too much into detail he gave me extreme anxiety and I was afraid to go home most nights. Our marriage was only a year, because I was unsafe. The divorce needed to happen but at the same time I have never been so hurt and so lonely when it did. I lost all of my friends because they were all his friends, he took most of my money without me noticing and when I tried to fight that he said his rich parents would pay for a lawyer and he knew my parents would never help me and because he took my money “I can’t afford it”. So I let it go. 

When I told my parents I was getting divorced they were furious. They were so ashamed and kept on saying how shameful this is and what are people going to think of them (never did they ask what I was going through) and how embarrassed they are of me. They also explicitly said they don’t want to meet any new man until I was engaged. They cared more about what they would look like rather than what I was going through. 

This was the worst time in my life because not only did I lose someone I thought I would be with forever, my parents were now no longer talking to me because of it. I found out about a year ago that my mom never told her siblings I got divorced and she has pretended for yearsss that I was still happily married, all because she is ashamed. They found out recently I was divorced because of my wedding invite. 

Fast forward 8 years, I am now happily engaged to the love of my life. We have lived together for 3 years and we get along so well, we never fight besides the usual bickers, he is my twin flame and just my perfect match and I am sooo excited to have my real dream wedding and be so happy with him. I honestly don’t even remember my last wedding because it was so traumatic so this is truly the wedding where I want my little girl dreams to come true. 

Anyways, when I got engaged my mom said she was happy for me and my sister said she was ranting about how she hasn’t even met this person. I was planning on flying out for the whole family to meet him (we have lived in different states for about 10 years) but at the same time, I don’t really care about their opinion.

My sister (24f) and I (17f) are both very tech-savvy. Around New Year's, we decided to work together on changing a popular video game. In January, the progress went along smoothly, and we got a lot of things done. I was in charge of doing the visuals while my sister did the coding.  
  
As the months passed by, I worked less on the mod in favor of doing school work. (I am dual-enrolled in college and high school) My sister graduated last year, she has no job, and she lives at home.  
  
She told me that she wanted me to play test the mod when I was trying to unwind from homework, and I told her I didn't want to do it. I wanted my free time, so I told her I didn't have the mental capacity to do that. We fought that day, and she didn't talk to me for a week after.  
  
I told her about my work, and she said I could miss a few assignments. I understand the mod is important to her, but school is a greater priority for me.  
  
We fought again today. She asked me to play test it again, but I didn't want to today either since I just wrapped up an essay. She told me that since I do no work for the mod, she's not letting me work on it anymore and she's never talking to me ever again.  
  
I think this is so childish of her.  Not only would the mod quality diminish, she's also ruining our relationship.

She said that I don't care. It aggravates me so much because I care about this mod, but she doesn't give me the time I need.   
  
Whenever she doesn't get what she wants she yells at me for it. I don't think she knows she does this, because I don't think she genuinely means me any harm, but every time I think about her I feel devastated now because she's always upset with me. She has no control of herself, and I would have expected her to be more stable-minded considering she's older. She's so intolerant of my mistakes and she's too stubborn to admit when she's wrong.  
  
She has such high expectations of me, and I feel like she's just being inconsiderate considering how much I do for her for free.   
  
I especially don't understand why I need to work on it so often considering it doesn't have any deadlines. We're not up against some clock! I can take my breaks where I need them!  
  
She has a right to be upset with me considering I was free both of the times she asked me to help her, but I just didn't have the energy. I'm so frustrated that she doesn't understand that though: she's never cared about education as much as me so she's never been under the same kind of stresses.  
  
I considered blocking her from the assets I created for the mod since ""I'm not a creator"" of it anymore, but didn't because I don't want things to escalate. She's normally nicer than this, if she does yell we'll fix things but I think she's passed a certain point where she should at least apologize.
