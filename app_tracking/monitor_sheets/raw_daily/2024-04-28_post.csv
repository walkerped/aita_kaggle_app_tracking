0,1cf1hzh,AITA for avoiding my ex for 3 years ,"I (m25) dated my ex for 8 months. It began during Covid and I would be lying if being incredibly lonely during this time did not impact how many red flags I was willing to ignore. 
We met in my small university town which was a long way from my hometown (7 hours drive), this is relevant later. She was not a student but a local who was training in an apprenticeship for her job. 
During our time dating things became incredibly toxic and problematic. This began after I moved back to my hometown. She would demand that we FaceTimed every night before bed and when I said I was busy she would make me feel like a dick for not giving her my time. She obsessed over my attention as she had been very poorly treated by people in the past, in particular her family, for bing transgender. I believe I was her first real real relationship rather than a man simply fetishising her. 
As well as the demand of my time she would also frequently hint at needing money. I was working a minimum wage job fresh out of college at this point but I would usually succumb and lend her money. This became a real issue for me when I realised we had to break up as she still owed me around $1000 which was a lot at the time. However, she was beginning to have a very bad affect on my mental health and so I realised we had to break up. However before I could do it she broke up with me by text while I was at work one day. I was sent home as I didn’t really know what to do. But a week later she messaged me asking to get back together and foolishly I agreed. We got back together and broke up again 4/5 times over the next 5 months.
Until eventually keeping it all a secret (as my family hated her for breaking up with me) and her treatment of me I couldn’t do it anymore. So I told her we had to spend a week not talking for my mental well-being and if I felt better after that time I would text her. 
But I saw my chance and blocked her on everything. 
After that she went quiet for a while. But after a month or two she began what has now been a tirade of attempts to contact me for 3 years. 
1. She would withhold her number and call me 40-50 times usually around 12-2am
2. She would make new social media accounts to get in contact. 
3. She sent a cash app request for $69 asking to call her (this one did make me laugh)
4. She would take the train (7 hours) to where I lived and try to come to my work and home. 
5. Send me emails/use friends phones etc you get the idea. 

However I persisted in ignoring all this and refrain from being active online under my real name. But it still persists. 
I have recently moved countries and use a chat app that is only used in that country. And yesterday she somehow managed to find my account. 
However, this made me wonder if maybe I’m the asshole for never replying. And would this all go away if I’d just messaged back after a week saying things wouldn’t work out?

1,1cexcbe,AITA for making my son pay me back as a consequence?,"My (F42) son (M15) has recently become friends with a new group at school, and his relative level-headedness has disappeared in place of wanting to take part in all kinds of schenanigans. They have been relatively harmless until this point, but I have asked him on more than one occasion to be smart in his decision making.

Recently, my son saw a video online where someone put a cob of corn on a drill and tried to eat it while the drill was spinning. Obviously stupid at best and dangerous at worst. Unfortunately, my son's friends convinced him to do this and he ripped out two of his front teeth.

Of course I was worried, so I rushed him to our family dentist who was thankfully able to fit him in. My son was in a lot of pain, but the dentist was fantastic! Unfortunately we had to go down the route of dental implants.

After this very expensive exercise, I told my son that I expext him to pay me back. If an accident had happened or he needed dental work as part of his daily life, I would have no problem as this is my obligation as a parent. However, he chose to do something reckless and stupid, and now must face the consequences. What makes it worse is that he knew the risks - the man in the original video ripped his teeth out too!

My son says that this is incredibly unfair, he says that he was acting like any teenager would and I should be prepared for unexpected costs as the parent of a teenager. He says that I am putting him at a disadvantage because he will either have to get a job or dip into money from his grandparents. I told him it is high time he gets a job anyway to try and learn some sense of responsibility, but he says I am being too harsh.

2,1cewvnw,AITA for not letting my BF bring her dog with her to stay with me?,"So to give a little background I (29F) live alone in a one bedroom apartment. One of my BF's still lives with her mom and they are going to be put out of the place they live in soon.
My BF has 3 dogs that she takes care of (only one of them is actually hers) and she asked if she can stay with me if/when they get put out. Of course I told her yes I have no issue with her staying with me especially when the cost of living is so high these days
Anyway, while I told her that she can stay I also had to inform her that she couldn't bring her dog with her. She didn't outright get upset with me initially (she actually seemed fine with it), but (maybe it's just me) she keeps telling me how the stress of finding somewhere to live with her dog has been affecting her health and saying things like how I ""can't deal with her  bringing her dog over"".
Now don't get me wrong I love dogs just fine but there's a myriad of reasons as to why I don't currently have a pet.
1. My lease does not accommodate having a animal in my apartment so I will be at risk of being put out if the pet is discovered. 
2. Her dog is NOT house trained. I can't even list all of the past stories she's told me of her dog peeing and pooping on her clothes, bed, carpet, etc. I don't want to say I'm a neat freak but I like my place to be a certain way and I just know I wouldn't be able to deal with an animal who isn't trained.
3. I love her but she isn't exactly the cleanest person (trust me I've been to her place and was afraid to sit down) so that combined with her dog? It literally almost makes me hyperventilate at the thought of it.
4. Again I live in a one bedroom apartment. So accommodating an extra adult is already tough enough as it is w/o adding a pet on top of everything else.
Idk. I've just been feeling really guilty about the whole thing and wish I could be the type of person to just welcome them both with open arms but I've done that before (taken on more than I could handle with people staying with me) and it made me so stressed out.

3,1cewnaw,AITA for not wanting to respond to my dead dad’s girlfriend? ,"Starting off with sorry for the long post.

A few months ago we were notified that my dad had passed. 

We were not close, both him and my mom stepped out of my life when I was little, gave me to his parents, and gave up their parental rights. 
Over the years I saw him once in a while and once I had my own kids, he sent them birthday cards. He visited us once. 

Anyway, the reason I was contacted is because the police had me as next of kin, which once our family situation was explained, they changed this and I was taken off their notes as legally, I wasn’t. His parents were given all information and they had been working with coroner, funeral home, etc.

The problem is… it gets complex with his girlfriend. They were together over 2 decades and when we were notified he had passed, they gave me her number to call. I’d never talked to her and neither of us had each other’s numbers.

I called her, and I regret it. I just wanted to help. She had lived with him for 2 decades and suddenly he was gone. So I felt bad for her. She didn’t know what to do with his things, his house, car, job/coworkers so I was offering to help. We don’t live in the same state so it was all over the phone. 

It’s well over the scope of this post but his parents were named his beneficiary at work so they took care of that (he had no personal will) and them and her have a very bad relationship. Ultimately she wanted his parents to come up and help her and I knew they wouldn’t so I offered. 

In the state they lived in there’s very loose guidelines behind what a common law spouse is, what that person gets in case of death, etc. 

His parents signed off that he was not married on his death certificate, and evidently this causes issues on what his girlfriend now has claim to. She technically didn’t contribute to their income and she isn’t on the car or house. So her family got a lawyer. I immediately stepped out. Everyone started trying to make me mediator. 

Over the weeks I’ve gotten small rant updates from his parents that the coroner called because her lawyer called them, or the funeral home, or his job. From my very little understanding, to get his parents to amend the marital status. 

Last week his girlfriend started calling me again. I just had a baby 2 weeks ago, and we were released from the hospital this Tuesday. I just cant/don’t want to deal with it. I answered once last week and tried to explain this but she seemed to want to get straight to talking about all of that and then (thankfully) the call dropped. She called today again and I was nursing so it went to voicemail but I sent her a text asking how she was doing, no response. 

She left a voicemail talking about past family issues, how she didn’t know what was going on, asking what his parents had been telling me and essentially that our family is heartless. I’m just going to keep ignoring her? Or does that make me a huge asshole?

4,1cewkzy,AITA For Not Turning Down The Speakers/TV At Night When My Brother Asks,"My brother is an EXTREMELY loud snorer, and his bed is placed right next to my wall, so i can easily hear it. Earplugs don't work for me. They are unbearably uncomfortable in my ear(i can't even use earbuds for listening to music. i hate how they fee. i only listen through speakers), and i believe i ways take them off in my sleep at some point and throw them somewhere I guess. I've lost like 3 pairs at this point. But either way its so loud you can still he it faintly enough through earplugs

I have found that blasting brown noise, either through my speakers or tv really drowns the snoring out almost completely if i play it loud enough. Not every night, but some nights he wakes up from it and bangs on my door demanding i turn it off because he can't sleep through it.  
i have gotten to the point where I'm just pretending to still be asleep until he gives up when he's telling me to turn it off.

I understand he can't control snoring, but his snoring is literally nails on chalkboard for me. Having to listen to these EXCRUTIATINGLY loud snorting noises the entire night not irritates me.... it drives me absolutely mad(and daytime sometime. Days he's off of work he'll sleep from like 11PM-1PM)

5,1cewfzs,"AITA For planning to go to my best friend’s wedding without my (38M) partner (36f), when my ex will be there?","I separated from my ex-wife 4 years ago. I have since started dating my new partner of 2 years - we share a ton of interests, have great chemistry and deep conversations and intellectual kinship.    
  
However she is very insecure and jealous, and has intense emotional reactions when triggered.  At times we could barely go out in public without her becoming upset because she thought I was checking out another woman, even though I had no idea who she was talking about.    
  
This has improved over time, but there is still a cycle of positive connection followed by her being triggered by what to me feels like nothing.  
  
Her insecurity comes down to not feeling “seen” enough in my life.  When we started dating, we were both going through divorce; we’ve since become much more open with friends, hanging out and even traveling together, though we haven’t gone as far as meeting family.   
  
Now, my best friend’s wedding is coming up, and he has asked me to perform the ceremony.  We met in college and they live outside the US, so it will be a destination wedding, with many old friends in attendance -- and since both he and his fiance are friends with my ex, she is invited as well.   
  
They don't know my partner, and it's unlikely she could attend as she is not a US citizen and getting a visa would be difficult.  Even if she did go, I am afraid that she would have an anxiety attack/jealous blowup and impact the festivities.   
  
I have absolutely no romantic intentions with my ex, and my partner knows and believes this. To her, though, having me go to this event with my friends, with my ex there, and my partner being left out is unacceptably painful.  It is a symbol to her that what we have isn’t real, and that I will be seen there with my ex and all my friends, without my partner as part of my life.   
  
I empathize with the pain this can cause - at the same time, I don’t think that my friend’s wedding should be used as a vehicle to resolve our relationship issues.  It’s not about us; it’s about them.    
  
My partner says this will be too much for her to bear, and that she needs me to change my plans or that she needs to break up and start emotionally distancing herself.   
  
She has stated that her basic need is to feel important, and that if I change plans because of her feelings, this will help her feel more validated.  But isn’t this a bad precedent to set?  

If this is her boundary, I will have to respect it; but I can’t help feeling that this ultimatum is unfair.  
  
It seems my options are:   


a) Break up and go ahead with the wedding as planned

b) Not go to the wedding in order to avoid the trauma/drama, sacrificing an important life milestone with a good friend

c) Compromise by only going for the 2 days of the wedding and come back immediately after, and telling my friends it’s because my partner is uncomfortable.   (this will involve changing international travel plans and mean missing out on time with my friends.)

I (21 Fem) got into a fight with a friend whom I’ll call “Josh” (23 M) about three or four days ago.

He is so goddamn sexy, I wanna marry him so bad.” (Which was totally understandable since Aidan is quite handsome).  
Now, you see, Josh has an ongoing and obvious grudge with a gay male that I’ll refer to as “Cam” (23 M) he sees quite often at his favorite bar where we socialize with our friend circle. This causes him to be somewhat homophobic towards gay males, and he was just rambling on about how ”disgusting” gay men are yesterday and that they were “menaces to society”.  
So I replied, “Wait, I thought you thought that gay men were gross?” This caused him to go insanely mad and throw sexist phrases and terms at me, like, “You’re a woman, go back to the kitchen”. When he said the phrase aforementioned, I was just as enraged as he was.  
So I told him, “You’re a drunk bastard, go back to your drunk gangster clan, you unsightly dog!” When I said this, he got angrier about the fact that I pointed out that he was the only alcoholic in our friend circle of nine people.

9,1cevsga,AITA for how I took my brother's comments? (Petty argument),"My cousin is staying with me, I'm helping him try to salvage his life which has been homelessness, injuries, misfortune, and addiction for a while. He's weird about what he eats and drinks. He doesn't like to drink tap water. He also doesn't drive or have the ability to contribute much monetarily at this time, so in other words I buy the groceries. The budget is extremely tight (too tight), especially with all his dietary requirements. Anyway, I try to keep water jugs on hand so he can avoid using tap water like he wants to.

He ran out of water yesterday morning or so. Shortly after I had gone grocery shopping. I hadn't known he was so low on water when I went, and I work full time and I'm a parent. So I haven't made it back to the grocery store yet. 

I mention maybe swinging by the store to grab an ingredient for dinner. He's like ""oh and I'm out of water"" I was like ""cool, I can get some."" Then he goes ""yeah no offense but the tap water just tastes bad and I ran out of water so I just haven't drank any water in 2 days and I'm really thirsty.""

And honestly this irritated me. I took him saying this as some kind of implication that him not drinking water for 2 days was my fault. I thought, why is he guilt tripping me about this water when I just said I'd get some, and he is perfectly capable of drinking the unflouridated tap water if he's that thirsty? I responded kind of snippy, I was like ""yeah, that seems like a bad decision, I don't see how that's my fault.""

We got into an argument. He says he didn't mean it that way, and I believe him. But he didn't understand how I could possibly take it that way, and that's been my sticking point. I'm willing to adjust to the knowledge that he wasn't trying to guilt trip me. But the fact that I took it that way seems reasonable. Why else would he proceed to complain at me about how thirsty he was?

But...I'm trying to improve my trauma responses. Maybe that really is a huge leap to make? Does his comment seem like a reasonable thing people say to make conversation?

hi! i (19F) am in a relationship with a man (19M) 😊 we’ve been really chill and alright but lately things have been rocky and i need an opinion. me and him are good at communicating and have been together for a few months! however the issue kinda started when he started blowing me off every time i asked to hang out or go out together. it was always a different reason like work needed him that day, or his mum needed him to do housework, and i am always understanding because i know life is busy. but the problem started when i one day found out he lied about where he was. he said he’d be at his grandparents house but i was out with some of my girlfriends at the mall and i see him there?? he was only there with his boys but i was really confused why he lied about where he’d be, especially when i was okay — encouraging even — of going to his grandparents place. i asked him later and he said it was a last minute change of plans and i shrugged it off. but this became a slight habit and happened a few more times. 

so one day i used his find my location and tracked him to a place and it happened to be a different place than what he told me. i basically ended up crying and making a scene and told him i didn’t want him to hang out with these guys if they’re going to lead him to lie to me. he said i can’t tell him who he can and can’t be friends with and now i refuse to talk to him till he apologizes and stops hanging out with them. my friends say that was immature and controlling of me but im just mad at the fact he’s so comfortable lying to me.

Earlier last month I put our home up for sale on websites just to help my grandparents out. I could get them a small affordable apartment, and a home for my family and I.

15,1ceu9wq,WIBTA if I put a lien against my parents' house and sued them for my college tuition?,"I, 17F, am graduating high school next month and am set to attend my first-choice college with a partial scholarship in the fall. It's an instate school about an hour away, and because of my dual enrollment credits, I should only be 5 semesters from finishing my bachelor's degree and then going for the master's degree I need for the career I want.

Five years ago my Mamaw, (mom's mom) died, leaving behind a college fund for me and my siblings, Kyle (M25) and Kelsey (F22). Mom's Aunt Teresa was supposed to oversee it, but she died in 2020, and somehow my parents wound up in charge. I don't know all the details because I was 12 when Mamaw died and 14 when Aunt Teresa died. I'm not even sure exactly how it was structured or how much there was, except that it was supposed to be enough to cover a significant amount of our expenses if not everything.

Kelsey is a fine arts major and her first year of college was derailed by lockdowns, and she wound up losing an entire year. She was supposed to go back for her final year next fall just as I am starting college, but last night at our Grandpa's birthday dinner (Dad's dad) she announced that she had been invited to participate in a Junior Artist in Residence study program and was deferring her last year of college. Everyone congratulated her and my grandparents asked about what sort of stipend she was getting. She said there wasn't one, but Mamaw's money would cover her living expenses.

My uncle said that between me starting college and them covering that, the fund would be empty soon, and would her share be enough to pay for her final year after? That's when my dad said that since I had scholarships and my sister needed it more, I wouldn't be getting any of the money Mamaw left for us. Everyone was shocked and started asking questions, but my parents insisted that it was important to support my sister's artistic goals ""the way we never were"", and that I'd be fine.

When my grandparents argued with them, Mom said I could take out loans for what my scholarship didn't cover and live at home to save money. I was in tears and my sister was upset that people weren't happier for her. When my uncle asked if there was even going to be money left for my sister to go back and graduate, my parents said they would take out a loan against the house to cover it.

Everyone got in a huge argument and my parents and sister left. My grandparents, uncle, and aunt got to talking and my uncle, who is a lawyer, says he's going to look into it and that we may have to sue them for my share of the college money because he believes they mismanaged it. My grandparents are worried about them mortgaging the house and losing it, and suggested we take out a lien against the house for my tuition money so they can't use it to get a loan to pay for my sister's expenses.

WIBTA if I sued my parents for my college tuition and put a lien against their house like my grandparents suggested?

Update: Thank you all for the advice. I know you can't just ""put a lien"" against the house, but my uncle and grandparents are talking about suing for the money and since my parents won't have it, putting a lien against the house. They want to move quick before my parents can ""do any other stupid crap"" as my Grandpa put it. We all know if my parents spent the money, there is no way they will be able to pay it back, neither will my sister, and Grandma basically told me, ""but at least they won't be able to lose the house"". My parents inheriting the house from Mamaw was the only way they could afford a home, they have never been good with money, so growing up my grandparents covered a lot of their bills so we could have groceries and that is probably why Mamaw left Aunt Teresa in charge of it. They are worried what will happen to my parents if they do take out a loan on the house because none of us believe they would be able to pay it back.    
  
My uncle is going to talk to his law partner about taking the case, but most importantly, I was able to call Kyle and since he was an adult when Mamaw died he actually has a copy of the will somewhere that he says he'll find and send to us, but he knew how much was in the account and where it came from. According to Kyle there was a 300,000 life insurance policy from when PopPop, my maternal grandfather, died, and Mamaw saved it for us to use for college. He's not sure how it was structured exactly, except he is pissed because his college didn't cost very much and what wasn't used was supposed to be distributed when we all graduated or turned 25, whichever happened first.  So they stole not only from me but from him too. I knew my sisters school was expensive, it's a private college, but I guess I assumed she was using loans or a scholarship or something? I never really thought about how they were affording her college, I just focused on doing well and getting as many dual enrollment credits as my school would allow so I wouldn't have to spend as much time or money when I graduated and went to college. When he told me I was in tears because 100K would more than cover my bachelors degree and probably my masters degree too. What I want to do (meteorology) really requires a masters or even a doctorate if you want to do any of the really interesting stuff. 

My parents were mad at me when I went home last night like I had caused the fight, so I just went to bed then went to work this morning, and am just sort of drained or like I got hit by a truck. My best friend says I didn't do anything wrong and just sort of got sucked into everyone else's drama and scheming, which seems pretty accurate. Even more stupid is that my grandparents told me that because they knew I had a ""decent amount"" from Mamaw,  they only saved for my aunts kids college funds, so they feel bad too, and Grandpa's birthday dinner got ruined. I got him some cheesecake from my work and I'm going to take it over to him when they get back from church tonight.   
  
Either way I got into my first choice college and am going to go, even if I have to sell blood or take out loans, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I'm trying really hard not to let this affect me too much because I still have final exams coming up and even though my grades are good I don't want to let this screw up anything else since some of my scholarships are dependent on my grades. My brother suggested in the meanwhile that I can file paperwork for my fafsa to not have my parents income counted, just my own, so I might be able to qualify for more aid, so I'm going to talk to my guidance counselor tomorrow about that.

My grandparents, uncle, and aunt got to talking and my uncle, who is a lawyer, says he's going to look into it and that we may have to sue them for my share of the college money because he believes they mismanaged it. My grandparents are worried about them mortgaging the house and losing it, and suggested we take out a lien against the house for my tuition money so they can't use it to get a loan to pay for my sister's expenses.

WIBTA if I sued my parents for my college tuition and put a lien against their house like my grandparents suggested?

Update: Thank you all for the advice. I know you can't just ""put a lien"" against the house, but my uncle and grandparents are talking about suing for the money and since my parents won't have it, putting a lien against the house. They want to move quick before my parents can ""do any other stupid crap"" as my Grandpa put it. We all know if my parents spent the money, there is no way they will be able to pay it back, neither will my sister, and Grandma basically told me, ""but at least they won't be able to lose the house"". My parents inheriting the house from Mamaw was the only way they could afford a home, they have never been good with money, so growing up my grandparents covered a lot of their bills so we could have groceries and that is probably why Mamaw left Aunt Teresa in charge of it. They are worried what will happen to my parents if they do take out a loan on the house because none of us believe they would be able to pay it back.    
  
My uncle is going to talk to his law partner about taking the case, but most importantly, I was able to call Kyle and since he was an adult when Mamaw died he actually has a copy of the will somewhere that he says he'll find and send to us, but he knew how much was in the account and where it came from. According to Kyle there was a 300,000 life insurance policy from when PopPop, my maternal grandfather, died, and Mamaw saved it for us to use for college. He's not sure how it was structured exactly, except he is pissed because his college didn't cost very much and what wasn't used was supposed to be distributed when we all graduated or turned 25, whichever happened first.  So they stole not only from me but from him too. I knew my sisters school was expensive, it's a private college, but I guess I assumed she was using loans or a scholarship or something? I never really thought about how they were affording her college, I just focused on doing well and getting as many dual enrollment credits as my school would allow so I wouldn't have to spend as much time or money when I graduated and went to college. When he told me I was in tears because 100K would more than cover my bachelors degree and probably my masters degree too. What I want to do (meteorology) really requires a masters or even a doctorate if you want to do any of the really interesting stuff. 

My parents were mad at me when I went home last night like I had caused the fight, so I just went to bed then went to work this morning, and am just sort of drained or like I got hit by a truck. My best friend says I didn't do anything wrong and just sort of got sucked into everyone else's drama and scheming, which seems pretty accurate. Even more stupid is that my grandparents told me that because they knew I had a ""decent amount"" from Mamaw,  they only saved for my aunts kids college funds, so they feel bad too, and Grandpa's birthday dinner got ruined. I got him some cheesecake from my work and I'm going to take it over to him when they get back from church tonight.   
  
Either way I got into my first choice college and am going to go, even if I have to sell blood or take out loans, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I'm trying really hard not to let this affect me too much because I still have final exams coming up and even though my grades are good I don't want to let this screw up anything else since some of my scholarships are dependent on my grades. My brother suggested in the meanwhile that I can file paperwork for my fafsa to not have my parents income counted, just my own, so I might be able to qualify for more aid, so I'm going to talk to my guidance counselor tomorrow about that.

A little background information my current boyfriend and I have been on again/ off again since August of 2021, he is 34 and I am 24. I have a full time job and recently bought a house in October of 2023. He made a lot of bad choices in his past, so is still in the process of getting his bachelors degree (he graduates in May 2024) and then has been accepted to a pharmacy graduate program starting August 2024 which is 2.5 hours away from where I bought my house(no I’m not moving with him). My boyfriend stays at my house typically Friday, Saturday and Sunday night and maybe one or two week day nights, so he’s here fairly often. If he’s not here, he lives with his dad full time. My boyfriend does not pay any bills at my house nor his dad’s house and pays only for his car payment and car insurance (he works part time and maybe makes $14 an hour). So when he comes over he walks the dog and may cook us dinner. I told him he doesn’t help make life easier one night after a 70 hour work week I had. I mentioned to him that he never cleans, vacuums the house, mop the floors, wipe the kitchen counters down, or help clean the bathrooms. He told me I should have to tell him what to do but he doesn’t mind help. He explained he doesn’t notice when things are dirty around the house but I do because of my OCD. He explained I should not expect him to clean the house and it was unfair for me to expect him to take initiative and clean the house without being told what to do.  He explained after a long day at work he doesn’t think about coming home to do additional chores at the house. Lastly, he said he unloads and loads the dishwasher which was “helping”. I told him he is an adult and should be able to notice when the house needs to be vacuumed or counters need to be wiped down and it would help me a lot. I explained to him I do his laundry on a regular basis to help him out but he doesn't do much to make life easier for me. After about 5 minutes of this conversation he said his heart was “pounding out of his chest” and needed some space, grabbed his beer and walked out to my living room and that’s basically where the conversation ended. Sooo am i the asshole for expecting my boyfriend to help around the house without being told exactly what to do?

  
update: we were finally able to talk it out. He explaiend he does not feel like either of us should have to “clean after a long day at work”. He explained he does not want a list to be made up for him as he feels like “I want my cake and eat it too”, he also said explained he would be willing to clean “on the weekend one day a week when we both can equally clean together so it seems equal” meaning we will make a list of everything that needs to be done such as mopping, sweeping, dusting etc. and split it in half so we’re both cleaning at the same time and this seems more equal and fair to him. He explained making a list for him to do is infantilizing him and treating him like a child. I told him we could make a list and both throughout the week mark off what gets done and he does not like this idea. He typically works weekends as a pharmacy tech, and I work M-F as a CPS investigator, with occasional overtime on the weekends. He said I make him feel like my job is harder than his job and all I do is “sit on my ass and if I’m not on a case I’m driving in a car or doing paperwork at a computer, so the majority of the time I’m sitting”; so him being on hit feet all day in the pharmacy is exhausting and he doesn’t think after a day at the pharmacy he should be required to come home and do chores.

Then they kept going on about how I'm an a hole for not supporting a local artist and that I'm ruining their business before I blocked them. 

I just think it's kinda scummy to claim it's 100% original art work when it's clearly not and is just up cycled repainted dollar store art. I'd be mad if I spent that much money thinking it's an original piece only to find out it's just from the dollar store and they scribble some paint on it. 
  
And it's not like the creative stuff that's popular online where the artist buys an old thrift store painting and adds a pop culture character to it and resells because at least you know that they up cycled it and don't claim it's all their original art. 
 
Am I wrong? Is it really considered 100% original art work? I'm autistic so I usually have trouble with people taking what Ive said as something other than how I've ment it so I'm not sure if it's something to do with that.

We spent over a year planning details and searching for the exact colours we wanted everything to be. My step-sister (30) “Stacy” got engaged late last year, and has been planning and coordinating a large scale wedding since then. 

During this time she made several extremely similar arrangements to my wedding, and has been what I would call a bridezilla. This has resulted in me calling her spoiled. 

For context some of the decisions Stacy has made since becoming engaged;

1. The wedding is taking place at our parents house (who are footing a lot of the bill) in the woods, and she has made our parents curate and grow the flowers for her wedding. These flowers are the same types of flowers that I had hand picked and tied into bouquets for my wedding, plus several more expensive types. Our wedding was also in the woods.

2. My wife and I both wore green, the wedding party and our son all wore royal blue. My sister has decided the men are all wearing royal blue, and the women are wearing green. I told Stacy I was going to wear a blue suit (not royal). This sparked a huge tantrum in which she stated that no family member can wear any blue or green, as none of us are in the bridal party. 

3. My sister and I had discussed that I was eloping, but would be planning a vow renewal for as soon as we could afford to host a “big wedding”. One of the things I had made very clear was that I loved the song Tell me something good, and would be using it for our entrance song to the party for the vow renewal, and it was the song that played while we toasted did our cake at our elopement. Stacy, upon starting to plan her wedding said it would be their entrance song for their party, and that I “should have saved and had a big wedding first”

4. While I don’t believe that family HAS to be involved in your wedding, our family is extremely close. Stacy asked me to be the DJ and my father to walk her down the aisle. I was very excited for this task and immediately started making a playlist, and writing an introduction for the newlyweds. Months after this, I presented the final products to her and was told I wouldn’t be using either of those, as our parents friend would be doing intros and all I was to do was press play on an add free radio station. I expressed my frustration to her about this, and was called an asshole. 

4.5 Our other sister (Tracy) was not asked to do anything to help. Tracy expressed to our mother that this upset her, and she must have spoken to Stacy. A few days later Stacy had the family together on facetime and was going on about how she had an extremely important question for Tracy and that it was a big deal. She proceeded to ask Tracy to be the one to fix her train for her, before walking down the aisle.

I immediately turned around and yelled back “I already cancelled the ikea order already so the pending charge will be refunded! And if it isn’t, you call them with proof the order was cancelled and they fix it!” I admit, I was condescending in that response. Afterwards I walked away from her and placed the order on my own.

I couldn’t even believe it. Left us high and dry. We did get an Uber; but I am still upset at him. Is it really wrong to expect a ride from your bf?",1.0,1.055355,1,1
23,1cet1qh,AITA For Getting Pissy When My Wife Ate My Food?,"My (M30) wife (29f) is pregnant with our first kid and I think it's been going pretty smoothly. She's due in August and if you're lazy like me and don't want to do the math, 5 months pregnant.

My wife, as any woman, has her pregnancy cravings, which was ice cream and potato chips. After work i would just run out to get them, not out of my way or issue really. Yesterday, after work I was heading to get takeout from a steakhouse, and asked my wife if she wanted anything. She said she was cooking at home and was fine. Note this is at around 5 p.m.

No problem, so I get my food and I'm ready to EAT when I get home. Upon first sight, my wife immediately started asking for some, which annoyed me it was whatever. I gave her a few bites, and gave myself a few bites before heading to shower (I know its weird to have some food *then* shower, but I didn't finish it, so it's okay).

10 minutes later, by the time I'm back to the dinner table, the container is basically fucking ravaged. And my wife said (May i add, sheepishly) she ate it because she was hungry, even though I specifically asked if she wanted anything. I was actually kind of annoyed by it and said ""you're not funny,"" before just making something else.

After I made my Plan B dinner, my wife came up me apologizing, but I was still bummed out about that steak and just said ""whatever."" I guess she was upset that I was upset because she gave me a face and walked away. 

I eventually told her it was no big deal, and I think that made her feel better, but I still feel bad, so im asking if the ass.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-28,"AITA For Getting Pissy When My Wife Ate My Food?

24,1cet1kn,AITAH for telling my dad I would institutionalize him if he kept faking illness?,"So, recently my partner and I spoke to my father about him moving out after he behaved badly towards me, as we share an apartment via a long winded story where I never wanted to live with him in the first place and he essentially foisted it upon me. 

After this convo occurred, all of a sudden he’s “ill and can’t work” and essentially locked himself in his room and refused to function. Ruined Thanksgiving, Christmas and a milestone birthday for my partner. Eventually took him to hospital to be told he’s fine and even the nurse had some words for him. 

Fast forward to last week. I ask him if he’s made any strides in reaching out to past landlords/realtor to potentially move states and he finally does so. Finds something affordable, in town, with a landlord he really liked. I’m pulling money out of MY RETIREMENT to help him with move in cost/transfer of bills. Ever since we talked about he’s been behaving the same way he did when we previously discussed his moving. Essentially mind melding himself into appearing sick even though he’s fine. 

I became upset and in the moment told him he needs to get his shit together or I’d be forced into looking into some sort of mental healthcare institution since he clearly has some problems. I feel bad for what I said but I do mean it. He meddles in everything we do, is home almost all the time, we have no privacy, and he messes with things like turning off the oven when we clearly are about to use it.
