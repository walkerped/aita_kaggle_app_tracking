0,1cfpr1q,AITA for not congratulating my best friend on her pregnancy ,"A little back story, I go to college 7 hours away from my family and high school friends. The fall of 2023 was my freshman year. However, I had to withdraw from college in February because of medical issues. I leave to go back to college in 2 weeks.

My best friend and I have been friends for 8 years, since 6th grade. Now, our friendship wasn't perfect it had been on and off since freshman year. Since graduating we have gotten closer and our friendship had been better than ever. My boyfriend came to stay with me over spring break and I had asked her if he could spend some of the nights at her house as she had a spare room and a queen-sized mattress. I only had a twin-sized mattress and I had to make my boyfriend sleep on the couch. She said that he could stay the whole week if he wanted to. 

Around this same time, she stopped her birth control and I asked her if she was going to use condoms and she said no that she and her boyfriend wanted a baby. They are nowhere near ready to have a baby. They just got a puppy and they live in an apartment they can barely afford. It wasn't a stretch to say I thought a baby right now was a bad idea, but I bit my tongue and said I was happy for her. She was super excited and said that I would be one of the first people to know right after her family. After my boyfriend left she ghosted me. We kept our Snapchat streak but every time I asked her to hang out she came up with some excuse. 

Fast forward a month, she posted all over social media that she was pregnant and she had not told me at all. A few minutes after she responded to my snap from earlier in the day, I opened it and didn't respond as I normally would. A few days later she sent me a text message saying that it was good being my friend but goodbye. I asked her what I did and she said that she was upset that I didn't congratulate her on her pregnancy. I explained that I was hurt that she didn't personally tell me about it. She said that it was because I said that she didn't need a baby because now she had a puppy. In all honesty, I don't remember saying that but I could've said it. We talked it through and worked it out. I asked her when she could hang out as I go back to college in 2 weeks and I don't know when I will be back. 

She once again ghosted me so I reached back out to her and asked why she was doing this. She made a bunch of excuses and I called her out on it. The biggest excuse was her pregnancy and I asked how her being pregnant prevented her from texting me back. This turned into a fight and she ended up saying that I would be happy if she had a miscarriage. I have no idea where she got this idea from. I don't agree with terminating a pregnancy just because. I told her to quit lying to herself and I hope that she and the baby are healthy. I have also removed her from every social media.

1,1cfpkg4,AITA for not letting a family member move in,"Backstory, I previously lived with my husbands parents/family when we were younger (early twenties). During this time his sister and brother also lived there. My husbands sister was a complete slob, would damage things from her anger issues and overall showed no accountability for any of her actions. She made it a very hostile environment for everyone and if she did not have her way she was making it known to everyone by screaming, throwing things, and damaging the property. Overall not a great person to be around or live with.

Now, she is going through a divorce because of her cheating on her husband and is looking for somewhere new to live. She has brought up that she would like to move into our house to my husbands parents without asking me or my husband about it. I know that the conversation will come up soon because we have plans to grab lunch later this week. 

I do not feel comfortable with her living with us, she has been sleeping around, is still a slob and our morals and values do not line up whatsoever. My husband also has said he does not want to deal with her nor does he want to support her. Her parents also do not want her to move back in but I am starting to feel guilty about not helping her through a hard time.

2,1cfpg0o,AITA for talking shit about my roommates to my partner?,"I (21F) and my partner (23M) are living with another couple (22F and 25M), Sarah and James. We live with them because it's a good way to save money until I finish school in May and start my new job. Sarah is a student and James is a janitor and doesn't make very much. Financially, this was a good decision. Sarah is the most negative person I've ever met. She is constantly talking shit about James to me and tries to get my partner and I to agree then talk bad about each other. Sarah also talks bad about everyone she knows, including my friends and mutaul friends between the rest of us, and I have heard her talk shit about me a few times but I turned on my TV so she knew I was home. Everyone who knows her warns me she is a narcissist and to be careful around her. My coworker is friends with her dad and says that she is bad news. We've been living with them for about a year and our lease ends in about a month. 5 weeks ago I decided I wouldn't talk to Sarah unless she spoke to me first because she was always so negative. We've talked once in the last 5 weeks because James talked to me first and she was there.

This past weekend I had enough and told my partner while in our bedroom that I couldn't handle how rude Sarah was anymore and he suggested I just keep being nice, be the bigger person because we will be living somewhere else soon anyways. I was upset and in that moment felt like he took her side. I went off about what a terrible person she is and how I hate living with them and called her every name under the sun. Yes, even that one. He finally got me to calm down after we argued about a few things for 30ish minutes.

James texted my partner and said he heard a lot of what was said and that he was sorry we felt that way and that he didnt realize we hated both of them but that he can't hang out with someone who doesn't like him. James and my partner have been friends for a very long time and I feel as if I ruined their friendship. My partner responded to James letting him know that there is no issue with him on his end and that he sees James as one of his really good friends. James left him on read. I texted James letting him know I never said anything about him and I think he's a good guy. He ignored me too.

Everything I said about Sarah, as rude as it was, is how I feel. My partner did nothing wrong. He even stood up for James and Sarah when I went too far but they don't care to hear it.

So, for context, this friend and I had lost contact over the summer as they didn't have a phone at the time, and we live far away from each other. We reconnectted this past September and messaged semi-frequently for months afterwards. Around the beginning of this time and during our conversations, I mentioned my dislike of texting/calling and how I prefer to speak in person.

Now, this person later became more clingy and physically affectionate in person and it bled into their texts. (Their nickname for me for the longest time was 'Cutie'). And I began to get uncomfortable and didn't speak up.

I soon began to stop messaging back, ignoring them until later hours until I merely left them on read every so often. This turned into infrequent messages. And then I would only text when out or on long car rides. And they would complain. And I would apologize, explain I spent my time with my family. My time on social media was limited, etc. etc.

Around the beginning of this month, April, around the 7th? They began to ignore me. They brushed me off and only spoke to me while in group conversations.

I am a part time singer-songwriter and i have a lot of songs that mention this ex by name that i still perform to this day(theyre very meaningful to me), and i haven’t asked my girlfriend how she feels about it but she’s been to the shows and im pretty sure she’s fine with it. 

anyways, after i told her i would be in town my ex invited me to her birthday party(which i was really excited about). It was a dinner with her and her family at a restaurant and i told her that my girlfriend and i would stop by. my girlfriend seemed a little confused when we got there, as she assumed that this was a party and not an intimate dinner, but she got along well with my ex and her family. she and my ex even wore the same color shirt, which i thought was really funny and i took a picture of them together to remember the whole thing.

while we were driving back, my gf seemed a little off and i asked her what was wrong. she said that it was weird that i wanted to go to this party, and it was even weirder for her to meet the girl that all of my songs are about. she said that i put her in an uncomfortable situation and didn’t really give her a choice in going to this thing and that she came to my hometown to meet MY family, not my ex’s. i thought the dinner went really well and she seemed to be getting along with my ex just fine. i think she’s overreacting and is coming off as jealous. am i missing something here?

5,1cfp3b0,AITA for selling an item instead of giving it to my sibling?,"Several years ago my mother was getting rid of a really nice motorized garden tool that she had for years and had used a lot but no longer needed. She asked if I wanted it. I was living in the country and had a large garden and it would be really useful so if course I accepted it. About a year later, my mother passed away suddenly and we were left to deal with her large estate. All the siblings amicably split up all the belongings we wanted to keep and the rest was donated. About 6 months later, I found myself in the middle of a long, nasty divorce and caring for my 4 children on my own. Money was tight and I had moved from my 20 acre property (in preparation for it to be sold and split by me and my ex) and moved into a small rental in town. I no longer had a need for the gardening tool and I really didn't have room for it. On top of that, I really needed money and this tool could be sold for around $1k. When my sister found out I planned to sell the item, she was shocked and said that she and her kids had a lot of good memories with our mom using that tool and she didn't want to see it sold. She asked if she could have it. I told her I needed the money and offered to sell it to her. She refused and became angry. She accused me of being insensitive and only caring about money. I reminded her that I was trying to support 4 children - on my own - with no help from my STBX and I needed every penny I could get my hands on. I also reminded her that this had been given TO ME - from our mom - years ago, because she no longer needed or wanted it. Obviously this item did not hold sentimental value to our mother.

And how could I possibly do this when our mother had passed away. I, again, explained my side and said that if it was that important to her I would happy to sell it to her but she refused. 

(Please know that financially she was more than capable of buying the item. Money was not an issue for her. I know for a fact she had more than $20k in savings at this time.)

7,1cfoega,AITAH for not wanting my boyfriend to hang out or talk with one of his childhood female friends who he had also dated in the past?,"So my boyfriend (19m) of 4 years off and on and me (f18) have been together for 1 full year and 2 months. Before we were off and on all of high school. The first time freshman year we got together he broke up with me too fool around with another girl (who was ""just a friend""), then got back together with me before telling me about the other girl which you probably know how that ended. A year (sophomore year)after that we got back together I ended up helping him cheat on his (at the time) current girlfriend without knowing it and found out about it afterwards. And then senior year we got back together and things were a lot different. He changed a lot got more mature and stopped fooling around with other people. 

We were dating for about 4 months and I ended up getting kicked out of my parents house because of school and went and lived with him and his sister. I had trust issues in the beginning because of the past and slowly we built that trust and now I trust him 99%. We ended up getting our own place and we have a great relationship. He recently brought up how he started talking to his childhood bestfriend who I will call Hannah. 

He had told me about Hannah before hand how they dated when they were younger but it didn't last very long. And the reason I'm very hesitant on this is because last time he talked to her I was on the phone with him back when we first got together senior year; and he completely ignored me and kept talking to her. And our friends don't like her either. I told him I didn't like the fact that he was talking to her and really didn't want him to. He swore up and down that he doesn't like her. So I hesitantly agreed and told him there will be boundries. She's not allowed at our house, he is not allowed to hang out with her alone or without me.

 I sometimes will check their messages just to make sure. He agreed with me and I really do appreciate it but I feel like l'm being toxic and unnecessary. Sometimes there is a small part of me that worries. I do trust him. And sometimes I get iffy when it comes to other girls around him but I try not to go overboard because I love him i our relationship.

We were dating for about 4 months and I ended up getting kicked out of my parents house because of school and went and lived with him and his sister. I had trust issues in the beginning because of the past and slowly we built that trust and now I trust him 99%. We ended up getting our own place and we have a great relationship. He recently brought up how he started talking to his childhood bestfriend who I will call Hannah. 

He had told me about Hannah before hand how they dated when they were younger but it didn't last very long. And the reason I'm very hesitant on this is because last time he talked to her I was on the phone with him back when we first got together senior year; and he completely ignored me and kept talking to her. And our friends don't like her either. I told him I didn't like the fact that he was talking to her and really didn't want him to. He swore up and down that he doesn't like her. So I hesitantly agreed and told him there will be boundries. She's not allowed at our house, he is not allowed to hang out with her alone or without me.

 I sometimes will check their messages just to make sure. He agreed with me and I really do appreciate it but I feel like l'm being toxic and unnecessary. Sometimes there is a small part of me that worries. I do trust him. And sometimes I get iffy when it comes to other girls around him but I try not to go overboard because I love him i our relationship.

8,1cfo5aa,AITA for giving away my dad and my sister's tickets to my graduation ceremony and telling them to not bother showing up,"I (18F) have my high school graduation ceremony this Wednesday. It was sent to my parents in an email that I will be giving a speech that day as my grades made me valedictorian of my school's class of 2024, and I was excited to do so. My school made us reserve and buy tickets to the ceremony weeks in advance, and I picked mine up on the 26th. 

The problem started at dinner when I told my family I picked up the tickets for my graduation day and would keep them with me until the day of just to make sure they don't get lost. My dad told me that he and my sister had plans for an hour before the ceremony, but that my mom would be there the whole time, and that they'd try to be there for the afterparty. I was honestly shocked for a moment, before starting to laugh, assuming they weren't serious. 

When I realized they actually weren't joking, I'll admit I was a bit mad. I'm usually a very shy and non-confrontational person, even around my family, but I started yelling at my dad and sister, asking if they were seriously ditching my graduation ceremony. I told them that the afterparty was useless to attend, and that all the pictures of the graduates with their families would be taken at least 2 hours before the ceremony. They said it's fine and we can take our own pictures the day after my graduation, but I got up and left dinner. 

Over the weekend, I saw a few people on my class group chat complain that they didn't get enough tickets, so I offered up the two tickets I had, and met up with a girl from my class to give them to her, and even though I told her not to, she actually paid me the original price for them. 

When the topic of graduation was brought up by my dad today during lunch, I told him that I gave the other two tickets away and only my mom will be attending, so they shouldn't bother with the afterparty. He got mad and asked why I would do that, to which I replied that I don't see the point in wasting money on tickets if they're not going to use them. My dad blew up on me, saying I'm acting like a spoiled brat, and it's not like I'll die if he and my sister are a bit late to my graduation. 

I spoke to a few people about it, my friends and my grandma. My friends said good riddance and if they consider their plans more important, they can have fun. But my grandma said that while she understands my side, I shouldn't have given away the tickets just to spite my dad, because maybe he would have changed his mind and gone on time. So I'm looking for a non-biased opinion. AITA?

11,1cfn5gh,AITA for playing a powerful MTG commander deck?,"So this is kindof a nerd question. I'll give some pre-amble for those who don't play Magic the Gathering. MTG is a game that has historically been played in a 1-v-1 format, but there is a specific format called commander which features multiplayer pods as well as a wide range of potential power levels decks can operate in. Commander players have a reputation for being a bit on the casual (less competitive) side. Tournaments are a thing but commander is also viable for friday night game night with the boys.

  
My friends and I have recently gotten into commander. I built my first deck with my brother's help, who is a very experienced magic player. Basically the deck works by chaining together extra turns. Totally legal, but maybe not much fun to play against. This deck proceeded to stomp the pod without much competition. My friends convinced me to nerf the deck, which I wasn't too thrilled about but I did it. Even after I nerfed my deck they would sort of grumble and groan whenever I pulled it out. Sorry, it's what I got!

After seeing their reaction I decided to build another deck on my own without my brother's help so my friends couldn't complain that I had an unfair advantage by getting help from a magic veteran. This second deck doesn't chain together extra turns but is powerful for different reasons. My friends still complain about how unfun it is to play against. Today I took the deck to game night at my LGS to see how it might be received in a different meta and I noticed my pod yawning and playing on their phones whenever I took my turn. To be fair, turns with this deck can take a minute, but I go as fast as I can. I have exactly one friend who seems to enjoy the challenge because he plays an equally powerful deck of his own making.

As far as I've seen, nobody in the magic community can seem to agree on what strategies are ""broken"" or ""unfair"" vs. what strategies are ""appropiately powerful"". Personally, I think that distinction is arbitrary and stupid. I think people should play whatever they want within the legal rules of the game, especially in a multiplayer format where power-levels can balance out by teaming up on the most powerful player.

  
I don't know what to do. I want to play to win, but I want to win in such a way that my friends want to keep playing with me. I've already dropped about $600 dollars on magic cards so I'm not to hip to the idea of building an entirely new (deliberately weaker) deck just to make my friends happy.

* He is (in my opinion) emotionally abusive to my girlfriend's sister.
* He disrespected me for no good reason in front of my girlfriend's family. Specifically, I asked the waiter if we could add a chair to our table at a restaurant so that he could join us - he then mocked/mimicked me...
* They very recently broke up (for the 3rd or 4th time), and are now back together + expecting everyone to act as though this didn't happen.
* My girlfriend and her entire family do not like him.

To clarify, I have never treated him badly, and accept that I will have to see and interact with him at other family events - I simply do not want him in my home.

Since the age of 12, my daughter would inquire about things to study and I would teach her different concepts in mathematics and physics and also programming. These days she self studies also. These are typically topics that are more advanced than what she learns at school and as a side effect it has made the school science and math seem trivial for her.

I recently a small assignment for her based on some 3D visualization tool where she can see a simulation and program the controller in C++ using a tool called Robot Operating System. I had her implement a [bang bang controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control) and [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller). Initially to learn on a simulated fan but then to drive a simulated car in a game like environment using simulated LIDAR sensors for the PID control.

While doing so and taking to her about the bang bang controller for driving based on collision detection, I made a joke about the bang bang controlled driving being like her mom's driving. My wife overheard us and got upset at me and called me a jerk. She had just scratched her car by backing into a low concrete ledge the other day and has scraped her car a couple of times before (maybe like 5 or 6). It was just a light hearted joke and I don't think she is a bad driver or anything just had some bad luck. 

She gave me a lecture and took it way too deep saying I am training our daughter to be sexist (which is ridiculous since she is a woman too) and that she will lose respect for her mom or myself.

My niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class. 

She has a high backed booster seat in my car. She's never cared until a couple days ago. I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out. 

I explained the booster seat to the nanny and she told me that the other girl also has a booster seat, just a backless one. I thought about it but I'm really not comfortable with my niece being in a backless booster. She barely meets the weight requirement for a booster seat and we've already had so many health issues since she's moved in with me that I need her to be as safe as possible right now.

I took her with me to get her booster seat and to drop it off with her babysitter and when she saw that we were getting a high back seat, she lost it. She said all of the other kids are going to be mean to her and I'm treating her like a baby and she doesn't want a babysitter if she needs a booster seat. 

I tried reassuring her that nobody in her class is going to know, except for the other girl the babysitter will be watching (and I've volunteered in this class enough to know that this girl is the sweetest thing and won't say anything).

My niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class.

I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out.

I live with my grandparents because both of my parents live 30 minutes out from the school I've attended since freshman year, my dad moving away end of junior year. Since I'm autistic and resistant to change, my grandparents let me stay with them. My grandparents also let my cousins stay with them as opposed to living with their dad. 

Darwin has always been a pain in the ass. He has ADHD, and in the beginning, I got it. But now he uses his ADHD as an excuse for every shitty behavior. Disrespects his grandparents? ADHD. Breaks expensive stuff? ADHD. Ordering stuff he knows isn't a safe food, hence wasting $12+ every time we go out? ADHD. My grandpa tries to be a disciplinarian, but my grandmother cuddles him.

I’ve been a regular edible taker for about 3 years now. I started to help fall asleep during college. Now I’m graduated for a few years, so I usually just take my edible after I get home for the day to chill, unwind, and still help me fall asleep. During the day, I have a great job, I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, financially independent, involved in the community, etc. So not the type to wake up and immediately hit a bong.

My boyfriend was raised in a home where weed is the devil. His father’s side has also dealt with alcoholism and it tore the family apart. A few reasons for not liking edibles is health concerns and feeling isolated when I get high, as sometimes I go a little mute. I told him I’d make more of an effort to be talkative if that’s how he feels. He also doesn’t think getting high every day is a good way to live life (seems to be the core issue here), but my thought is, if I have my shit together life-wise and I only get high at night, does it really matter?

He makes some valid points and I want to respect his wishes, but on the other hand, I don’t feel like I should have to stop to appease him, especially when it seems like the biggest reason he doesn’t like it is because of his family. I empathize his family doesn’t like weed and that addiction has caused many issues for them, but that doesn’t have anything to do with me.

Some context I am a (26)Male. I work really hard to make ends meet and take care of myself and family. I live with family and pay a good portion of rent. I also tend to alot of different family members needs on a pretty consistent basis, leaving me with not alot of time to myself. I do like to joke around from time to time with all of the people in my life, but nearly most of them seem to take things too far. I get called little annoying nicknames like gayboy, smelly, and alot more honestly. Some things my family does too is consistently cut me off when I'm talking about something important, and then get mad when I tell then to stop and that it's rude. 

An Example: Me and my mom are at the dinner table talking about musical artist and how we feel about some of them. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like a good chat about the music industry. She says what she wants to say, then I start talking. As I do she gets on her phone then ignores me as I'm talking. Watching a tiktok video out loud. I recognize this and stop mid sentence, kind of disappointed. She then says something about how I look like the guy in the video. I then ask her if she was even listening to me. She then gets mad and says that I'm being rude for pointing out her own rudeness. I then get yelled at and berated because I just wanted to talk and enjoy a conversation with my mom. 

Another problem I have alot is when people touch me. I do NOT like being touched. It is something I've made a point to many people. Yet many of them still touch me. For instance family members will touch me even with out asking me, and it will scare the shit out of me.

All it is, is a preference, and something that startles me. I don't have alot of trust in alot of people and I've been hurt by people I even thought I loved. I just want boundaries.

I'm not in the best financial situation right now, I just moved states and so I'm working still on building my savings back up. The wedding is towards the end of the year, so I started saving all my cash tips.

Fast forward to March; The MOH started planning the bachelorette party, which I was very excited for. A couple weeks later, she sent the itinerary, with the dates being in May. It was 3 days in a pretty expensive city, I figured since it was 12 of us that the air bnb couldn't possibly be that much. (Side note, for context, there were 3 restaurants on the itinerary with an entree being around $50-$60, a private at home brunch with a chef, and a few more pricey activities) After totaling everything up, the bachelorette party would cost around $1100 per person for 3 days including the restaurants, airbnb, and activities. (not including travel costs, groceries for the airbnb, outfits we were told to buy, etc.)  

The bachelorette party is next month. I told my friend last month after finding out the costs that there was absolutely no way I'd be able to come. I feel terrible for not being able to attend.

With the cost of the bachelorette party, getting my passport, paying for a place to stay in this country, food, and plane tickets.. I chose to attend the wedding obviously, because I can't go to both.

Things were tight but I was able to take care of eveything. Do something nice for my kids on their bday, celebrated christmas etc.

Even though we had no money he would go out most weekends with his friends, during the time we lived together he didn't invite me out once or accepted any invitations from me to go out together because he would argue that we needed the money for the house and I should save it. 

Sex was also not great, I was always the one to initiate it and even then sometimes it felt like he wasn't into it. So after a while I stopped initiating it too.

After new year I celebrated my 30th birthday, this was a huge thing for me so I had been saving for it. I invited all my friends and his friends, got a pool house and had a huge bbq party. I spent about US$500 of my money.

One night we were home and his friends showed up to pick him up at 1AM. He just received the call and stood up to change shirts and after I asked him were he was going he said ""Out with my friends"". I felt that 1AM was not the right time to go out so I asked him not to go. He got upset and ended up telling his friends to leave. After which he yells that he was tired of everything, that he didnt want to be in this situation anymore and that the blame for everything is my poor control of money, all the money that I spent on my bday and mostly my financial responsibilities towards my children, he said and i quote ""You have so much responsibilities and baggage with your kids that we will never be able to be financially stable"".

Maaan listening to him say all that felt like an ice cold bucket of water had been poured down my spine, I could not believe my ears after being the only income for 5 months. 

The next day I asked him to move out. He tried apologizing but it was too late for me. 

The apt where he lives with his dad is small, so he doesn't have space for most of his things, desk, playstation, monitor, 2 bedside tables, 2 chairs and clothes.

I asked him to come get his things but he never does. I've been waiting for 2.5 months, he's been here a few times to get some items of clothing but no intention of taking his things with him.

26,1cgeffp,AITA For not considering the baby part of the family,"AITA For refusing to give up the baby items?

Ex and I were married for 20 years.  We had 2 kids together.  Our son was the 6th grand child 💙 born on his side, and our daughter was the 7th grand child and first Grand daughter 🩷 on that side. There were 5 more kids born after her.
On my side, our kids were the first grandchildren.

I have always been into vintage/ handmade items.  MIL would make blankets / sweaters / booties / mittens for all the babies.  When our daughter was born she also made rompers and dresses for her.  The other 'daughters' never appreciates what she did. In addition to what SHE made, she also gave us the sweaters that were given to her son (my husband) by his Nannies (grandmothers).  My mother, (first grandchildren) would shop at $$$ boutiques for out fits for my kids 🙄 She finally came to reality and started shopping cheaper.

My kids also wore the Christening gown that MY grandmother had worn. (Yeah, it was old).

In addition to the clothing, there were toys.  Toys from their grandparents when they were babies.  Toys from  their father's side that none of his siblings wanted for their babies.   Toys from my side I wanted them to have. Toys they got as gifts. And yes, I had all the toys tested for safety before I allowed the kids to have them.


The kids grew up and out these things.  I packed these items up in boxes so that when our children have children of their own, these things will be available for them if they want them.


Our marriage didn't last.  He walked our on us, and left all boxes (baby items) with me.  He quickly remarried. 


His wife has a daughter that was out of the house when they married. The daughter, recently had a baby.  Now, his wife had seen photos of our children wearing some of the items I had saved up, and SHE feels that since HER daughter had 'the first grandchild' 🙄 that SHE (her daughter) is entitled to all the baby items I had saved for future grandchildren.

AITA ... He walked away and left all the baby items with me. I saved the items so that OUR children will have them (if they desire) for THEIR children (OUR grandchildren).  They (him & wife) feel that since his wife's daughter gave birth, she is just as entitled to the saved baby items as our children are.

And yes, I could ask ex-MIL what she would like me to do with the items, but I really don't want to get her involved if I don't have to.

I MIGHT be TA for not allowing my ex to give baby items from OUR kids that I saved for their future children to his wife so she could present them to her own (already existing) grand babies.

In 2022, I began planning a trip for my immediate family to go to the 2025 Expo in Osaka. I intended to pay for my whole family. The purpose of the trip was to show my family how I travel and live and bring them a bit more into my life. Previously, my family largely stuck to Disney so my travel style and destinations of choice are just very different to what they’re used to. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my partner (invited of course) mentions her aunt and cousin want to go and invited them. I waited to today and told her that I would have appreciated if she talked to me about it first. 

She said she did not understand why it would be family only. Said she is not family so she doesn’t want to go. Said “I’ll be sure to ask you for permission in the future.”

I’ve been trying to express to her that this not a slight on her but this was always immediate family and partners only. It was a _____[insert my last name] family trip. 

I think she might think I’m an asshole for excluding her family and being controlling. But I don’t see it that way. It’s been in the works for years and never have we discussed inviting anyone. My family has never met her family and I don’t think the first time meeting overseas is appropriate. I also don’t want to have her time torn between two groups of people. That’s not at all the kind of time I was hoping for and it’s been an issue in the past.

29,1cge10b,WIBTA - For resigning as coach over a friend request,"First off, I am very fortunate, I have a great job that provides me a ton of time off. I also have a couple kids who I really enjoy doing things with. This has led me to volunteer alot, like 6+ hrs a week, this includes coaching multiple teams, chairing 2 school PTAs, and some charity work.

This post is around coaching, as eveyone who has kids in sports knows there is always a challenge on getting coaches. To coach a house league sport at my childs age it's usually about 4hrs a week commitment. 

Recently, a league was having challenges getting coaches (I was looking at taking the summer off of coaching so i didnt volunteer), then I started seeing emails looking for coaches, and in chatting with some parents ""in the know"" they stated the league was looking at turning kids away if they didn't get more coaches, or making the teams carry ridiculously large rosters, I suckered it up  messages the league and said i would volunteer.

My comment to the league was, I have no problem coaching, but im hoping they can help me out by putting a couple of my childs friends on the team as well, for reference the two friends are not good at this sport, one has never played before and the other was ranked 1 (out of 5) in skills, so them on the team wouldn't have made us a power house or anything like that.

The league didn't commit just responded with a ""we will do out best"", the league policy is they will try to accommodate 1 friend request, so I knew there was no garentee here.

We got the league rosters over the weekend and none of the three kids were on the same team, so ok that sucks, I send out the typical coaches first contact email and I get a response:

Thank you so much we are excited that the league was able to put child 1, child 2 and  child 3 all together they will have so much fun this year!

It was a typical, I got your email response, but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way with the league. I did message the league to see if there was anything I could do, there response was, ""we apologize, but the rosters are already set, we do try to accommodate friend request, unfortunately, in this case we were unable to do so"". 

Now to today, a friend (who is commissioner of another sports league intown) reached out and says he needs coaches, and asked would I be intrested. He went on to say he thought of me because 4 of my childs friends registered and he could put them all on the same team!

There is no way I could coach both sports, if I register my child with the second sport he would miss about half the first sports games. 

Also, my child is showing alot less intrest in the first sport now the he has no friends on the team.

Both leagues have 150 to 200 children registered for them.

So WIBTA if I decided to resign from coaching the first sport 2 weeks before the season starts, and coach the second sport because they are willing to put more friends on my childs team, even though I never got a garentee the first sport they could meet the friend request.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-29,"WIBTA - For resigning as coach over a friend request First off, I am very fortunate, I have a great job that provides me a ton of time off.

For the duration of this time my ex hasn't been very present in our son's life and only paid child maintenance when I made that happen about 2 months after he left. I tried to set up an informal and written contract after he left to ensure he still got to see our son regularly even if it was just over the phone on FaceTime. He denyed this request and said it wasn't a legal contract and I couldn't enforce it. Fine, you're right it's not. I then didn't hear from him until a month before Christmas in 2022 saying he wanted to come and see our son as he's missing him and he's brought presents. Okay fine, I set up a date where my son would be with my mother, my ex came, he saw our son and then left and I didn't hear from him again until the March 2023, between then and Christmas last year once again his calls became very few with odd times where he'd be consistent but then he'd fall off the face of the Earth again. It's worth mentioning that he is a single parent to his child so I fully understand that being a parent has its challenges and there's not always enough time in the day. Last week we spoke and I once again asked for a consistent line of communication between us because I had been quite angry towards him about a missed child support payment but then afterwards realized I'm just angry that the one thing he uses to show his love with isn't there. The money he paid every month half of that went is the pot for our son's birthday/Christmas presents and half on essential needs for our son.. that was the only constant. He says it's for travel to come and see our son in the next couple of months but skip to today (the agreed upon day to call) and I hear nothing from him, no text, nothing. 
It's stressing me out because I know how much he let me down when we were together, he was not the person he claimed to be and I don't want him to buy our son's affection as he gets older but isn't there for him if he needs him. I want my ex to agree to give up his parental rights under the reason he himself stated, that 'he is struggling to support two children' when in reality it's because I don't want him to break my son's heart. 
So I ask.. am I seriously overreacting and being the asshole and what the heck do I do here if I am...

35,1cgd5fj,AITA for not getting upset or convince the bride after I was uninvited to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened over the weekend but there’s still so much tension. 

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side.

36,1cgd1dc,AITA for not wanting to add my dad’s fiance to our Facebook group announcing pregnancy? ,"My husband (23M) and I (23F) found out we are expecting and recently announced it to all of our family and close friends. (Just a side note, when we called and told my own father [56M] had the worst most unenthusiastic reaction of literally everyone we called to tell the news. I.e we spent 30 minutes on the phone, and less than 2 were talking about us or the baby- the other 28 were talking about my dad’s cow farm and work.)
We decided to make a private Facebook group to add all of these said people to in order for us to have a more private way of sharing updates with a larger crowd. My husband and I did not immediately add my dad’s fiance, C, (60F) to the group bc neither of us are crazy about her and she has treated me like crap in the past. 

A bit of background, C and my dad started dating 1 month after my mom passed away when I was in high school. They were engaged less than 3 months after my mom’s passing, and prior to my dad ever even introducing her to my brother and I. She then would come over every weekend and practically every holiday and act like she was the queen of the house and whatever she said went. For the most part, my dad still enables that despite how my brother (17M) or I feel about her. 

Anyway, after my dads reaction (or lack thereof) to his first grandchild, in conjunction with the fact we aren’t keen on having C involved in our child’s life based on how she’s treated me in the past, we didn’t send her an invite to the group immediately. Plus, I was sending out invites as I scrolled across peoples names on my friend list. 

My dad then sent me a text 2 days later angry asking why or if I didn’t invite C to the baby page. It ruined the rest of my day as I stressed about whether or not to invite her and I broke down and did it anyway. He has done this on several other occasions, (our wedding, my HS grad, etc) basically guilting me into including C. in everything despite how much I don’t like her, bc I cannot seem to want to completely cut off my relationship with my dad. He has always created these situations where he is allowed to be mad that we don’t include her, but we cannot be angry or show any emotion contrary to liking her.

39,1cgcfwv,AITA for not going to my friend's birthday because I feel like she's taking over my life,"I (22f) have a friend named Brittany (21f). I've noticed some patterns in her behaviour and I wanna know if I'm being overly sensitive or not. I find that she involves herself in everything I do and I can't really have a friendship to myself. I have a really close separate friend group, and every time her and I would make plans to hang out she'd invite everyone in my friend group even though they aren't close at all. Sometimes they would even ask me why Brittany is messaging them. Here are a few examples of why I feel her actions are overbearing:  


  
\- Brittany and I had plans to hang out, and once she found one of my friend was dropping me off at her house, she invited him inside also.  


  
\- Her and I were texting, it'd been a while since we last talked. The first thing she says to me is ""Do any of your friends listen to this \[music artist\]?

\- For new years her and I had no plans, she said she'd be out of town. Last minute she was back in town and forced herself onto my plans.  


  
\- She ranted to my mom??? about her ex boyfriend, then said ""Let me get your number, we should hang out when Grace (me) isn't here!""  


  
\- One night I bought Brittany around this guy I had a crush on. They'd never hung out before. Him and I were friends but there was obviously something more between us, we were extremely close. She knew all of this including that I had a crush on him. All of a sudden they started hanging out every weekend, and she went on a overnight road trip with him and never told me about it. It's interesting because the night I brought her about him I felt a little hesitant.  


  
\- I have this feeling she's insecure when it comes to boys. When I told her that a different guy from my past messaged me and we started seeing each other again, she had the weirdest reaction when I told her him and I reconnected and tried to downplay everything. She knew how much I really liked this guy and I thought she'd be happy for me.  


  
Lastly, her bday party was this past weekend. I decided not to go because of the way she's been making me feel. She wanted to do something big for her birthday and expected me to plan the entire thing (I never said I would). My guess is because I have lots of friends that I could invite. I wished her happy bday but I can tell in her response she isn't happy with me for not going. But this girl has genuinely made me feel like, is she upset I didn't go or upset that I didn't bring 5 other people (my friend group) with me? I just question how much she values ME. I'm looking at our texts and everything is just can your friends come. I want your friends at my birthday. I want your friends to join us. I don't mind if all my friends hang out but sometimes she makes me feel like I am not enough, it feels suffocating.

  
AITA for not going to her birthday?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-29,"AITA for not going to my friend's birthday because I feel like she's taking over my life I (22f) have a friend named Brittany (21f). I've noticed some patterns in her behaviour and I wanna know if I'm being overly sensitive or not. I find that she involves herself in everything I do and I can't really have a friendship to myself. I have a really close separate friend group, and every time her and I would make plans to hang out she'd invite everyone in my friend group even though they aren't close at all. Sometimes they would even ask me why Brittany is messaging them. Here are a few examples of why I feel her actions are overbearing:  


  
\- Brittany and I had plans to hang out, and once she found one of my friend was dropping me off at her house, she invited him inside also.  


  
\- Her and I were texting, it'd been a while since we last talked. The first thing she says to me is ""Do any of your friends listen to this \[music artist\]?

40,1cgcahw,WIBTA for not listening to my parents' telling me that I can't change my name.,"I (15f) was ""named by God"" according to my very religious parents. During my mom's pregnancy, they were struggling with names and the name Hannah with her prayer appeared on a cross gifted to them, so that is what they named me.

I hate my name, so I go by a shortened version of my middle name and have been for a while without telling my parents for fear of their reaction. Even though my chosen name is still a feminine name, it would still be too ""transgender"" for them. I'm just afraid of disappointing them. 

Now, a few months back, I told my friends that I was going by Alice instead of my first name, and they have been really supportive and are trying their best with the switch in names. After I had told my friends, I worked up the courage to tell my parents.

They didn't react well, but they said that they might consider going by my full middle name. A few weeks later and I've been going by Alice for a while now, with all my close friends using it. I genuinely do not like my name, and I haven't liked it for a long time.

This was the first move I had made on changing it and they told me that they wouldn't allow it.

I didn't accept that and have still been going by Alice at school and with friends. My parents don't know. So, would I be the asshole for not telling them about it?

[Original link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/WFshhvSUZE)

Hello everyone. I thought I might make an update regarding the post I made about kicking my sister out of my house. First, I like to thank everyone who commented and assured me that I was not doing anything wrong by kicking my sister out. 

Here’s the update: the first thing I did, despite everyone’s warnings, I went over to my parents house to talk with my aunt and my sister to come up with a solution as my aunt did say my sister couldn’t stay long term as there isn’t any room. 

We talked and surprisingly my sister followed my aunts house rules. She cleaned up after herself and she even bought groceries when my aunt said she didn’t need to do that. My sister apologized to me for giving me a hard time and not keeping my apartment clean when I’m gone at work. She admitted she was just too lazy and didn’t think I’d be that angry to the point where I’d kick her out. I accepted her apology and that’s when my aunt asked my parents if they’d be comfortable letting her move back in with them as my sister is no longer welcome to stay with me. My parents said they did some thinking and they are willing to let her stay under one condition: she needs to contribute and not just with household chores. She needs to start paying rent and after she gets a job, she needs to start looking for places of her own. 

My sister has a part time job at the university so she agreed to my parents conditions. That was a couple weeks ago. Now, I was over at my parents house an hour ago for lunch and my sister had improved! She doesn’t leave her clothes in the living room and cleans up after herself. I asked my parents about that and they said another part of the condition is if she made a mess or didn’t clean up after herself, she will have to pay a fine (which is $5). Since my sister wasn’t willing to spend so much money knowing she would be charged with fines if she didn’t help keep the house clean, that was when she started being a bit more responsible. I guess the only way to get her to clean is if you charge her with a fine lol. 

That’s the update. I’m just relieved that there was no drama or problems. Now, one thing I do need to mention is that my sister wasn’t really happy at first about having to pay rent or financially contribute, but she agreed nonetheless and that’s what matters.

“oh yeah haha. forgot to tell everyone to stay out sorry”. now you see in that situation i have to keep myself calm because if i get mad he turns around and blows up in my face and makes everything my fault and i’m the b**ch for getting angry first. it happens all the time. i get the slightest bit mad. to the point where ik dam well u can hardly tell i’m angry but he sits there and screams and yells at me like no tomorrow and then when i go and uh play fruit ninja it’s “ur such a manipulative person are you serious?” i don’t know what to do anymore. i’m tired of this. his family sits there and says that i’m too mature and that i wear the pants in the relationship but they go and say that i’m a needy b**ch and that i’m too sensitive and that i need to eat more or i need to eat less, like just typical stuff old people would say to you. but the main thing is my bf and his friends. his friends have sat there and called me a whale over and over till i cried when i’m 5 ft and literally shaped like an hourglass. i don’t know what to do about it. i feel so unheard and like i can’t talk to anyone. i have tried sorting it out with my bf but he either goes off at me or tells me he’s going to change but he never does. be honest am i just being sensitive or aita or is there actually something wrong here?

46,1cgbq33,AITA for not wanting my ex husband to buy me gifts I don't think he can afford?,"It's my (29F) birthday soon and my ex husband (34M) keeps trying to buy me expensive gifts. It started with a festival ticket, and then two so that I could pick someone to go with me, he hoped I would want to bring him. I had a panic attack and begged him not to buy the tickets. He reluctantly agreed and we had a several day argument over it and how i make him feel. 

For context we broke up in October, and still live together he is very much still in love with me and trying to 'win me back' the ex has not worked in around 4 years so has no money of his own I recently made him sign on so he has his own money for the first time in a long time - despite me always saying he can spend whatever just check with me if it's over £40 (sometimes im skint or need to wait til payday) and attempting several times to get his own bank account so he could have his own he never did and felt guilty for spending even on essentials. 

For the first month of him getting benefits I told him to not pay rent so that he could treat himself and gain a bit of a buffer. He has been very insistent that he gets me a birthday present - I have never enjoyed my birthday and I really don't need him to buy me gifts when he doesn't have a lot, and we are not together! 

A few days after the ticket buying incident he says he has found something else he wants to get me. Looks small and quite nice, some simple gloves. I said sure and told him my size, I did not see the price only the image. But now he's sent me the link to them to check it's a pair and not just one glove. But they are pricey 
Some more context - I am a seamstress so when I see things like that I think how I could make them very quickly.. my yearly clothes budget is less than £100. I know this is an issue I have about people buying me things that I don't seem worth and that I struggle to see my own value. 

Ex keeps saying that he wants to spoil me and I deserve it, this is the first time he has money and if he can't be generous to his friends what's the point in having money? 
I can't shake the feeling that this is transactional and that it means I have to be equally 'generous' or that if I accept he will get his hopes up that I'll go back to him. - I keep reiterating that he will not be able to win me back and i feel like i am being clear with where our relationships stands 

Basically I think I could be the asshole because he is just trying to be nice, I never let him buy me nice things, I hate my birthday and take it out on him and I am probably just over reacting.

Some more context - I am a seamstress so when I see things like that I think how I could make them very quickly.. my yearly clothes budget is less than £100. I know this is an issue I have about people buying me things that I don't seem worth and that I struggle to see my own value. 

Ex keeps saying that he wants to spoil me and I deserve it, this is the first time he has money and if he can't be generous to his friends what's the point in having money? 
I can't shake the feeling that this is transactional and that it means I have to be equally 'generous' or that if I accept he will get his hopes up that I'll go back to him. - I keep reiterating that he will not be able to win me back and i feel like i am being clear with where our relationships stands 

Basically I think I could be the asshole because he is just trying to be nice, I never let him buy me nice things, I hate my birthday and take it out on him and I am probably just over reacting. 
These are all things he has said to me in the past. ",0.0,0.01651972346007824,0,1

48,1cgbb0e,AITA for asking my partner to get a professional haircut for our (maybe) wedding?,"My partner (early thirties M) and I (late twenties F) have been together for almost a decade. We have a house and dog together and share all financials. 

Neither of us is big on the whole getting engaged and big wedding thing and are both of the mind that a marriage/wedding/marrying someone is first and foremost a financial contract. We are obviously big romantics. Different reasons at different points throughout our relationship have made it a bad financial decision to sign the papers (which was more or less the general plan at some point).

Our 10 year anniversary is coming up and the date of the anniversary is on the tenth of an upcoming month. It’s on a weekday so the courthouse is open. I had the idea that it could be cute to get married on our anniversary and invite our parents and siblings to a small garden celebration. Get a bit dressed up and make a day of it. This is all still very much a general idea that is being workshopped between my partner and I.

We are now stuck on the topic of my partners hair for the “big” day. I asked if he could get it professionally cut. He wears it short and for most of his life his mom gave him a buzzcut (which he preferred). His family is very frugal and saw it as a cost saving measure while my partner preferred the style. It was fast and kept it short. I then took over cutting it and taught myself to do a simple men’s cut that kept the top a bit longer and the sides shorter than his usual. At the time this was a big change for him and took a while for him to agree to. I think the “new” cut looks better and allows for longer between cuts. As of today he says he prefers the new cut.

He doesn’t want his hair too long on the day and would either want me to cut it or for him or his mom to do a buzz cut. I said that I would rather he get it professionally done. I have a friend who cuts hair and is willing to give a free haircut. He has met this friend and likes her just fine (even had his hair cut once by her when she was a student). I said that I don’t care how he cuts it, it can be a buzz cut for all I care, I just want him to feel his best on the day.

He said that he won’t do it. I said that if we go with that date then the amount of work that needs to be done is quite a bit and that that is not another thing I want on my list. I also don’t want uneven strands sticking out (as usually happens with the buzzcut route).

I am unsure of who gave the ultimatum first. If he said that he wouldn’t do the party/formal ceremony if he has to get his hair professionally cut or if I said that if he wouldn’t get it professionally cut we just skip the party/formal ceremony. The end result then being the original plan of signing the papers in jeans on a lunch break sometime. 

He is mad that I gave him an ultimatum. I am sad that this has spiralled into a whole thing.

Also, we go out basically every week, and I not only pay for but arrange everything we do together.

50,1cgayu4,AITA for wanting to move out of my boyfriends house?,"My boyfriend (20m) and i (19f) have been together for almost a year now and living together for a little over 6 months.

Here's the problem. My boyfriend has a very controlling family. It's one of those situations where everyone lives within 30 minutes of each other. We currently live 10 minutes from his parents house, are renting from his brother, and we can see his sisters house from ours, which is.... interesting. They're always up in our business and saying stuff they shouldn't. It's been suffocating to say the least. 

I recently dyed my hair red because it's something I've wanted to do for a bit. I have some of his family on Facebook so made sure not to post so that they wouldn't see it and cause problems. I kind of forgot that sister lives next door and I guess she saw me outside with my new hair and went gossiping to the rest of the family. A few days after that my boyfriends dad (we'll call him David) came by the house for some things and made a joke about me dipping myself in a vat of dye. It was funny enough, so I laughed and kept minding my business

A few minutes later David calls me over and says he needs to talk to me. The first thing he said was ""You know I'm always straightforward about things..."" He then went on to say that he didn't know what was going on with me, but that whatever it was, this color didn't look good on me. he said that natural hair always looks better on women and that I don't look as attractive anymore with red hair. I said ""Well I like it, and that's all that matters"" and started walking away while he yelled ""oh come on, don't say that! They told me you were sensible!!"" I literally just went inside the house and slammed the door.

Similar things have happened before. At easter dinner David was hinting at what our sexual life was like and asking me if I was making sure my boyfriend was out early and in late so we couldn't get up to anything ""bad"". I replied that we both work early and what happens when we were in OUR OWN HOME shouldn't matter. He then turned to my boyfriend and went ""oh good you're making your woman work!! That's really good."" 

My boyfriend hasn't spoken up for me any of these times and I've talked to him about it and his excuse was that if he yells at his dad, we lose everything. 

This is when I find out that the property he ""owns"" isn't in his name yet and he only has his job because of his dad. In addition we rent from his brother, which I already knew, but putting everything together made it feel worse. 

I told him if things got any worse I would have to move out because I feel trapped and I didn't fight for independence from my own abusive and controlling parents just to end up in another similar situation as an adult. I told him he was welcome to leave with me but that I would eventually need to leave regardless. I am seriously considering moving away from everything so I can breathe and live life without someone looking over my shoulder. AITA for wanting to do this?

51,1cgask7,AITA for sharing my poetry after a school tragedy,"Edit: I guess I should add that she told me she was angry with me sharing those poems two months after the tragedy, so there was a bit of a space between the event and the conversation we had.

I (F24) wanna talk about a weird conflict I have been going through recently. I am an aspiring poet and several months ago few of my poems got published in one of the most important poetry magazine in my country. Unfortunately, the publication happened a day after a huge tragedy took place at my university during which several people have died.

I wondered whether it was appropriate to announce the publication on my fb page because of what happened the previous day, but I came to the conclusion it was harmless, since the poems were already out and the ppl who didn't want to read poetry at that moment did not have to. However, the post got me in a conflict with a friend of mine (F25).

The friend is a photographer and  took a couple of photos as accompaniment to the poems. She got very angry with me, because she felt the post was disrespectful to her as a co-creator. She was in the school during the tragedy and although she was in a completely different part of the building she felt quite traumatized by the event.

I told her I wanted to look at the silver lining of the situation and focus on a life moving on rather than dwell on the tragedy (it was quite painful for me as well, two of my friends got severely injured). I also liked having a distraction from the dreadful event. I did not asked anyone specifically to read it, I just felt like it was okay to post after the event about other things than the event. Three of my classmates told me that they found the distraction pleasent as well.

I asked her what did the post mean to her. I was okay with apologizing to her and looking for a solution, but I just could not  (and until this day cannot) grasp why she was so angry about it. She did not gave me any reasoning about it or an explanation, she told me it hurt her a lot.

She also mentioned several other ppl being insensitive to her and I felt like she was just expecting to much from ppl. She was angry at one person who wrote to the school group chat ""gee, I'm glad I skipped a class today"" and at her boss because she did not approach her to make sure she was alright (this caused my friend to quit the job). I told her I thought she was overstating the harm. it just felt like she was pissed at everyone who did not react to the situation in the exact way she wished them to.

53,1cgaq0t,WIBTA if I asked my friend to talk less about sex when we hang out?,"I (22F) have a really close friend (23F) who ended a pretty long relationship (for our age at least) about half a year ago. After she broke it off, she talked to me about how she was excited to try out new things, experiment and do one-night stands and stuff like that, since she's only ever been with one person whose preferences didn't really line up with hers all the time when it came to intimacy.

It didn't take too long before she joined a BDSM club, something she talked to me about for some time before going. It was a success and she's been going there a lot ever since, even meeting and beginning to date a new guy from there who is a total sweetheart – I was incredibly happy for her and also very proud of her for experimenting.

Since she started going, she's become much more open about her preferences and her sex life when we're together, both when it's just the two of us alone and when there are other people from our pretty big friend-group present.

At first, I didn't really think about it and actually thought it was nice. It's been really great being able to talk about fantasies and kinks without fear of being judged.

However, recently I've begun noticing that we pretty much only talk about her sex life when we're together. It's always ""I did x with y"" and ""I have this kind of sex toy, want to see"" and ""I had z punishment for doing v"" and ""here's a picture of me being tied up"" and so on. I don't always want to talk about sex so I often try to change the subject, like ""have you been going on any dates with your new boyfriend"", but she immediately turns it back to sex with stuff like ""yeah, I've been to his place and watched a movie and then he gave me 10 orgasms in a row"". I can barely make a joke or say anything without it immediately being turned into something sexual.

I think I'm hesitant to ask if we can talk about it less when we hang out because she's talked to me about how she was a bit scared that people would judge her for being into the things she is, and I really don't want her to think that I'm judging her or don't want to talk about her sex-life – there's definitely space for that in a friendship, I just don't want it to take up everything in the friendship.

She talks a lot about her sex life an when our friend group hangs out too. I really don't want to talk about sex in larger groups so I usually just kind of sit those conversations out, but our friend group is pretty open about these things and seem to have no problem whatsoever, and it only makes me feel like even more of an asshole for sometimes thinking that I don't necessarily want to talk about that stuff. 

WIBTA if I asked my friend if we could talk less about sex?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-29,"WIBTA if I asked my friend to talk less about sex when we hang out? I (22F) have a really close friend (23F) who ended a pretty long relationship (for our age at least) about half a year ago. After she broke it off, she talked to me about how she was excited to try out new things, experiment and do one-night stands and stuff like that, since she's only ever been with one person whose preferences didn't really line up with hers all the time when it came to intimacy.

It didn't take too long before she joined a BDSM club, something she talked to me about for some time before going. It was a success and she's been going there a lot ever since, even meeting and beginning to date a new guy from there who is a total sweetheart – I was incredibly happy for her and also very proud of her for experimenting.

Since she started going, she's become much more open about her preferences and her sex life when we're together, both when it's just the two of us alone and when there are other people from our pretty big friend-group present.

At first, I didn't really think about it and actually thought it was nice. It's been really great being able to talk about fantasies and kinks without fear of being judged.

However, recently I've begun noticing that we pretty much only talk about her sex life when we're together. It's always ""I did x with y"" and ""I have this kind of sex toy, want to see"" and ""I had z punishment for doing v"" and ""here's a picture of me being tied up"" and so on. I don't always want to talk about sex so I often try to change the subject, like ""have you been going on any dates with your new boyfriend"", but she immediately turns it back to sex with stuff like ""yeah, I've been to his place and watched a movie and then he gave me 10 orgasms in a row"".

During that time I've mostly helped with my 2f niece. Recently my sister has had another baby (5 month old at the time of this post), and I've ended up watching her as well as my 2f niece. I have a bond with all the kids, especially my 2y niece as we've been together for long hours of the day since she's been born. 

I have identified & came out to our mother as bisexual when I was 11, ( recently realized that I am lesbian). For some reason I've come out 3 times since 11, each time as bisexual, & each time I've been met with extreme hostility from our mom. The first time at 11, my sister asked me about it. For brevity, I gave an excuse and was never asked about it again.

Over the last few years my sister has made a few homophobic remarks, which she never used to make growing up. Recently these remarks have ramped up & taken over. Being that I am constantly at her home and spending time with her& her family, I hear it much more often. My sister constantly talks about ""gay agenda"" and is starting to instill in her children this rhetoric. 37f sister has started to suspect that 12m is gay (she went through his phone and saw messages of him saying he is bisexual to his friend). 

I live with our mother, and we live <15 minutes away from 37f so I've basically been an on call babysitter for ages. But with this uptick in negativity oozing from my sister (not even kidding. it's ALWAYS a topic when I come around) I've been wanting to come around less,& distance myself. I feel terrible about even considering distancing myself from my nieces and nephews especially with 12m struggling mentally from the disparaging remarks of his mother. But these kids will grow up however they will with how their mother is raising them. Going from 5 days a week to 0-2 will be jarring for everyone.

She is stuck in her mindset, and debating the protections of any community with someone who has no intentions on seeing another pov is not an interest of mine. my heart hurts and I suffer a bit each time I'm around family. I need a bit of advice redditors ... WIBTA?

56,1cgafx8,AITA for wanting to stay away from my friend of 10 years,"It's a really long story but I will try to explain this very briefly.

So this dates to a few years back when my friend of 10 years \[Chris\] started to become obsessive, he started expecting me to hang out with him too often, with no respect for my boundaries. I didn't know how to speak up back then, so I tried to say it nicely rather than firmly. My other friend \[Ann\] advised me to set my boundaries early on but I didn't know how to, However, \[Bri\] told me that we were overreacting. And Chris started to say that Ann is just sabotaging our friendship.

After some thought, I decided to talk to Chris to stop spamming my DMs or Inviting me to hangouts so often, since I was busy irl and ADHD doesn't help, By the end of the day I was out of energy. *(By spamming I meant that they even had set exact times I wake up and they send messages the moment I open my eyes till I close em)*

But he didn't take it well and the situation escalated badly for several months, and i ended up cutting him off.

After a few months when things settled down, we decided to reconnect and clear up misunderstandings. It went well, Bri helped us reconnect. We went back to being friends, but I wasn't as close as before and I had set my boundaries. However, Chris started becoming overly clingy again, and started to be nosy, I had gone through a hard time and had some changes in my life. If he didn't find an answer from me, he would try to ask other friends, even though I always say ""It's personal"". He started to ask too much from me and would complain about my late replies. He also mentioned an old wound when he couldn't get me to talk about my personal issue, which made me feel horrible. *\[ I had entrusted this friend with really private matters previously.\]*

After some time he confessed. I couldn't help but feel betrayed and vulnerable, I told Bri since she was neutral to both of us. She told me that they were aware of this, but couldn't tell me, However Bri had advised Chris to stop the weird act and not be forceful about his feelings, he had done creepy acts a few weeks prior *(ex: Looking at my personal belongings) \[I can't mention them all because of the character limit\].*

Anyways, I respectfully rejected him, it went well until I asked for some time away, I just couldn't feel comfortable. I saw through Bri that Chris had told her he had been using any chance to get closer. That made me feel like our friendship always had an ulterior motive. Chris proceeded to say and do stuff that made me extremely uncomfortable. So I just decided to stop talking to him because he kept arguing when I asked over 5 times to have some distance **for now.**

I have been told that what I did was too much by Bri, and that I'm overthinking it. And that Chris told her that he will move on and I didn't have to cut him off. I keep saying I didn't cut him off for no reason, I wasn't planning to. I did it because when I asked for some distance nicely I couldn't get any!

We both work at a mechanic shop as technicians, when he first started there he was living with his parents still and really wanted to experience some form of independence. We became great friends quickly, and he inquired about renting me and my wife’s furnished basement out and being our roommate, as well as helping him learn independence and living on his own. It was a good arrangement and we charged him almost nothing so that he could save.

He dated a girl during his residence here that was not the most well intentioned partner one could ask for, I never spoke on it as it wasn’t my place. But one day they argued heavy enough that they separated, during a conversation after the fact he asked me to tell him what I really thought of her, and I did. He seemed upset that I gave a different answer than how I had respectfully treated her and their relationship, and asked me to give my honest opinion up front about any other girl he dates.

Enter new GF (25F? I don’t even remember how old she is. Just that she’s older than him and younger than me) that he meets on a dating app. From the get go, I could tell something was off. In the first week he would leave to see her regularly after we got off work, often spending the night at her place so I had never even met her. The first time he brings her over, she avoids any interaction with me and my wife at any chance she could. She wasn’t in our home for more than a few hours before they both left for her place. After two weeks of dating her, he informs me that he is planning to move in with her. I dig into it a bit more and learn he also agreed to start paying half her bills (more than he pays us by a long shot) and get concerned. Without stating directly how stupid that sounded, he was already showing signs of being upset with my reaction so I didn’t press. He moves in with her, and then it gets much worse.

At first it seemed fine, then I hear they argue a lot from him at work, then after a month they are engaged and talking about having a baby together. Then he starts missing work much more frequently, and to now, the heavy part. He informs me that he stopped taking his bi-polar medication, because his girlfriend (who is a CNA) has convinced him he is fine without it. He is not, he switches moods erratically and for no given reasons, and is a dark place to see him in.

I 23f when i first started at this job my manager didn’t really talk to me but after a week of working there he needed my number to get a hold of me if he needed to me to come in or to pick up any shifts or if i had questions. at first he didn’t text me so often and im not a big texter myself. 

These were very long shifts sometimes a lot of overtime since I started. as weeks go on i noticed he started to give me more attention and texting me more. (there wasn’t a lot of girls where i worked) but there was still girls for him to talk to. Just like an average person would do i go to work and do what im assigned to do and then go home. however through out my shifts i noticed he would constantly talk to me or make ways to go another side of my job from where i would be just to see me even if its the longer way to go. he would constantly text me out side of work hours and try to get to know me on a more intimate level and know things about my childhood and stuff like that. if i didn’t respond he would get annoyed even mad at me and be petty.

At this job I did have a crush on some guys and don’t get me wrong I would flirt with them and I did hook up with some of them. somehow my manager found out that i was talking to multiple guys at the job and he got LIVID blocked my number and completely ignored me even if he was the only manager scheduled. he noticed i didn’t care bc he’s my manager why would i care that means he can stop bugging me and texting me. while he texts me he would sometimes say “i want you to move in with me” (my home situation was crazy at the time) but it wasn’t crazy enough for me to want to move out. i do admit i would respond purely outta boredom but i always knew to never get flirty with him or cross lines. I lived across the street from my job so it was convenient for me to work there. One day me and my coworker clocked and we’ve been booking up a couple times a week actually but we knew to go to my house a different times so my job doesn’t see us walking together. that same day my manager drove by and was pissed. texting me and calling me, calling me every name in the book and saying hell transfer me but then regret what he said and tried to get me to talk to him again or just even reply. i can go days w out responding to his messages and he would always get so butthurt and it was an endless cycle where i felt like i was being watched and he would make comments about my clothing and if i wore something that wasn’t even revealing but shows my tattoos and stomach outside my uniform but first to comment.sometimes he would text me he wanted me go to go over to hang out.The two guys I was hooking up with never said anything to anyone bc we three had a 3 way and we all never wanted that to be known information at work. my boss wouldn’t stop calling me so i blocked him

61,1cga4it,AITA for seeing my old dentist?,"So… Last September I moved to a new town as part of my current job. My hometown is about a two hour drive away and I kept most of my professional contacts there (doctors, accountants, etc.) This week I needed to go to the dentist because I’m a year overdue for a checkup. I tried to schedule an appointment with the dentist here, but they couldn’t get me in till October. Without many options nearby, I called my old dentist and quickly got an appointment set up the following Monday at 10:30 because it was the only time slot available.

Because my workday starts at 9, I spoke to my boss about coming in late on Monday. I explained that I was overdue, and I had to go back home for the appointment. I would have just taken the day off, but my paid time off is very limited due to being a recent hire. My boss agreed to let me come in late and - after confirming the appointment was at 10:30 in the morning - I assumed that was the end of it.

Cut to earlier today. I left my apartment early because it’s a 2 hour drive home, got my checkup, and left hometown at 11:30. So I arrive at work at one. My boss won’t speak to me and later on during my shift he practically walks up to me and accuses me of “taking advantage of his kindness” because he didn’t know I was going to be gone till 1. I tried to explain that I never attempted to lie or take advantage since I’d laid it out early on that Id be driving home for the appointment which was a four hour round trip. He wasn’t having it and then asked why I didn’t set up an appointment locally to which I explained that I’d TRIED to do this, but time wasn’t working out. 

So now he’s claiming I should have mentioned this when confirming I could come in late and that he could have gotten me a local checkup. Like, how was I supposed to know he was friends with the local dentist?! It’s not like I don’t come from a small town either, I was driving back to a city for this appointment so he would have known what my travel times would be.

Now, I was very upset, because G1 had no reason to even bring me up to G2, but I’m also upset at G2 for saying that about me. I found G2 on instagram, and texted her “Keep my name out of your mouth piggy.” Now she’s telling people that I’m “bullying her” for being fat, and that somehow I was in a secret relationship with G1.

63,1cga17f,AITA for not following the feeding schedule for the baby?,"My husband (M29) and I (F29) had a baby three months ago, and she has been very happy and bouncy up until this point. She was doing so well and sleeping through the night, and so her doctor recommended that we put her on a schedule for her naps and meals.

The schedule was that she would nap, eat as soon as she woke up, and the have two hours of play before going back down. Unfortunately our previously very happy baby absolutely hated this, but we persevered thinking a) this was following advice from the doctor, and b) it would help to have the baby on a routine for when I go back to work.

Unfortunately, the baby was right. The schedule has screwed up my milk supply and she has started losing weight. Now I have had to go on medication to increase supply and we are needing to supplement with formula. To say I was upset with the doctor is an understatement. I only did all this on his advice! 

Yesterday was the first day since learning of her weight loss, and I was feeding the baby on demand and topping up with formula. However, the argument comes in that my husband believes we should still be sticking to the same routine but now just supplementing. He is saying that her going off the routine will screw up our lives and we will go back to ""having the baby in charge.""

I said that I would rather feed the baby when she shows hunger cues instead of keeping her on something we know has been doing her harm. My husband says that he will leave me alone with this decision but I shouldn't come running to him when I can't get anything done. He also said if I choose to do this, he will not help me at all when I return to work as the schedule was put in place to assist in that transition.

64,1cg9w7g,AITAH for not accompanying my mom to visit her family?,"(TLDR): My mom’s family was toxic when I was young, so I refuse to spend time with any of them. Now my mom wants me to accompany her to see the family and I really don’t want to.

Posted on r/advice but mom and brother don’t like my stance on the family and im feeling like I might just be a jerk (I’m a 24m)

My mom (50yo) has a big family, some 10 siblings and a fuck ton of cousins. Growing up going to family events I was surrounded by drama, violence, alcohol abuse, etc. My grandmother (80) is loved by her children despite being an abusive person who would literally beat her kids till they bled all while yelling how much she hated them.

I hold no love for my grandmother and most of my aunts and uncles. I have no fond memories with them and I don’t feel bad for my lack of interest in their lives. When I was a teen I would take every chance to hang out with friends on holidays like Thanksgiving and New Years instead of going to see the family with my mom.

I understand why my mom wants to see her family, she’s a very loving woman and is nothing like the family. They have done her so much wrong but she chose to be the bigger person and forgave them. 

Fast forward to April 2024, I’m visiting mom for her birthday, and grandmother is also in town (for unrelated reasons, didn’t know mom’s birthday was near, sheer coincidence). Mom and my brother want to visit grandmother and they insisted I join them.

I don’t want to. I don’t feel like I owe it to the family to give them any of my time. If I go I won’t talk to anyone and they don’t talk to me. The family doesn’t act as crazy and shitty as they used to, but that doesn’t matter to me. I have my mom, my brother, and that’s all the family I need. 

My mom has made a point to let me know that it’s unhealthy to hold on to resentment or hate. 
I just want to stay home and skip the family gathering all together. I’m here to see my mom for her birthday and that’s it. Even my brother is saying I shouldn’t be so cold, that maybe I can be the one to change my current dynamic with the family.

69,1cg9egs,AITA for wanting to learn Korean?,"I've never used reddit but an online friend suggested I post here, so please bear with me. :(

I (14f) started to get interested in K-pop/K-dramas around last year. I'm not super obsessed in a weird koreaboo way (think the cringe ""oppa I saranghae you"" way) but more of the ""I just like the music"" way.

My family has a tradition that when you turn 15 years old, you're required to learn a new language, completely on your own. Like, completely. They won't help you with any learning, no advice, no resources, nothing at all. You're required to find your own resources, study on your own, buy your own materials, pay for your certification exam, and if you want a tutor, you have to find and pay for one yourself. The most they'll do is drive you to buy the stuff/get to your tutor and that's only until you get your own license and can drive yourself.

I'm not sure when this tradition started, but I do know it's gone on for a while. My mom, Grandpa, and Uncle learned Spanish, my Grandma learned French, my Aunt learned Dutch, a few cousins learned Arabic, and I don't remember a lot more. But it's a lot of languages. It's like a test of maturity, I guess? It's basically saying that if you can learn an entire language by yourself and speak it fluently, you're mature and intelligent enough to make it on your own. The longest it's ever taken someone to master a language was 12 years, and he was learning Thai.

Anyways, because I started really enjoying K-pop and such, I was thinking I should start to learn Korean on my 15th. I already consume so much media in the language, so I think learning it could fulfill my language requirement, and allow me to understand what I'm listening to without translating. I'm really not trying to be a  koreaboo or fetishize it, I just think it would make sense for me to learn the language that I enjoy.

I was talking to 2 of my friends about this (we'll call them Janice and Sky), and I mentioned that I was already putting money aside for Korean workbooks and my TOPIK exam fee, along with creating a learning plan. They both began to call me a koreaboo (they both listen to Kpop but more casually, not buying albums and stuff) and asked me why I would learn it. Sky (who is caucasian, for reference) said I'm fetishizing it and I probably want to be Asian.

It'll be my 15th birthday in a few months and I really need to make a decision. I don't want to be seen as a koreaboo, or do anything even closely related to cultural appropriation. AITA for wanting to learn Korean?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-29,"AITA for wanting to learn Korean? I've never used reddit but an online friend suggested I post here, so please bear with me. :(

I (14f) started to get interested in K-pop/K-dramas around last year. I'm not super obsessed in a weird koreaboo way (think the cringe ""oppa I saranghae you"" way) but more of the ""I just like the music"" way.

My family has a tradition that when you turn 15 years old, you're required to learn a new language, completely on your own. Like, completely. They won't help you with any learning, no advice, no resources, nothing at all. You're required to find your own resources, study on your own, buy your own materials, pay for your certification exam, and if you want a tutor, you have to find and pay for one yourself. The most they'll do is drive you to buy the stuff/get to your tutor and that's only until you get your own license and can drive yourself.

I'm not sure when this tradition started, but I do know it's gone on for a while. My mom, Grandpa, and Uncle learned Spanish, my Grandma learned French, my Aunt learned Dutch, a few cousins learned Arabic, and I don't remember a lot more. But it's a lot of languages. It's like a test of maturity, I guess? It's basically saying that if you can learn an entire language by yourself and speak it fluently, you're mature and intelligent enough to make it on your own. The longest it's ever taken someone to master a language was 12 years, and he was learning Thai.

Anyways, because I started really enjoying K-pop and such, I was thinking I should start to learn Korean on my 15th. I already consume so much media in the language, so I think learning it could fulfill my language requirement, and allow me to understand what I'm listening to without translating. I'm really not trying to be a  koreaboo or fetishize it, I just think it would make sense for me to learn the language that I enjoy.

I was talking to 2 of my friends about this (we'll call them Janice and Sky), and I mentioned that I was already putting money aside for Korean workbooks and my TOPIK exam fee, along with creating a learning plan. They both began to call me a koreaboo (they both listen to Kpop but more casually, not buying albums and stuff) and asked me why I would learn it. Sky (who is caucasian, for reference) said I'm fetishizing it and I probably want to be Asian. Janice (who is Japanese-American) didn't take it quite that far but said it was weird and that I ""probably won't be an Idol anyways"", and there was no point in me learning it for a ""Korean boy who doesn't even know you"".

I have explained multiple times that we can’t really swing an extra payment of any kind right now with our financial goals and current debts.

The dealership is firm on price but I truly believe it’s not a valuable buy. I don’t think he’ll get the use and mileage out of it that he believes, and we’ll be stuck with this car payment for longer than we even have the car.

79,1cg7xz4,AITA for not wanting to invite my mom's boyfriend to her mother's day dinner?,"Myself (19F) and my 4 siblings have a difference of opinion about inviting our mom's boyfriend to her mother's day dinner.

Yesterday, my mom messaged on our family group chat to ask if we would invite her boyfriend to her mother's day dinner. Every year for about the last 5 years we've taken her out for a meal on mother's day. She separated from our dad in 2015 and she raised us on her own since then.

She's been with her boyfriend for a little over 3 years but they still don't live together full-time. He stays at our house on the days he doesn't have his 3 kids. Obviously, on mother's day his kids will be with their mom and his own mother has passed away. My mom thinks it would be nice to invite him this year as we haven't in the past. 

3 of my siblings (20M, 17F, & 15M) agree about wanting to invite him. Myself and my oldest brother (22M) don't want him to come. Our argument is that it's supposed to be a special evening for us to celebrate our amazing mother. I like our mom's boyfriend and have nothing against him, but is it wrong for me to think it'll be nice to have some 5 on 1 time to celebrate our mom.

My 20M brother feels quite strongly about inviting him. His argument is that he's basically apart of our family now and it feels right to invite him. He'll probably bet at our mom's all weekend so we would just be leaving him at home alone to go out for dinner. He also tried to guilt trip me into agreeing to the invite by bringing up that our mom's boyfriend's mom died when he was 12. He feels it's wrong to leave him alone on mother's day for this reason.

Another point I've brought up is that on father's day last year none of my siblings were included in the boyfriend's outing with his kids, despite the fact our dad's not involved in our lives. I didn't care about it then and I only bring it up now to compare the similar circumstances.

I think my siblings and I's differing opinions comes down to closeness. My 2 brothers (20M and 14M) are particularly close with the boyfriend whereas the rest of us are still less so.

81,1cg7t3b,WIBTA if I refuse my friend's request? ,"Hey everyone! 

I (21M) have the following friends which are relevant to the story- Sarah (21F), Jake (20M), Adrian (20M), and Stella (20F). Some background, Sarah and Jake have been in a relationship from late 2022; Adrian and Stella have been on-and-off since around May last year (9 breakups and getting back together 10 times). I have known Stella since the start of our time in our university, then I got to know Adrian through mutuals, and I've known Sarah and Jake closely for the past year. 

For some context, Sarah and Jake are good academically (both having 2 tech internships under their belt), as well as being quite fun, as we've been on trips, and have partied together. This has made me develop a close bond with both of them, both socially, and academically, even though we've known each other closely only for a year. 

On the other hand, Stella is someone who needs constant emotional support and we've been there for each other whenever the other has needed it. Adrian was someone whom I considered very close till the last year, but his regular breakups with Stella, and his tendency to drag me between their issues, as well as constant lashing out and emotional outbursts over several of his breakups on me has made me a bit distant. As of now, I consider all four equally close to me.

So now coming onto the main issue. Sarah and Stella were put in the same dorm/room this time around and things have been going okayish between them. Adrian and Jack chose to take a dorm/room together, despite Adrian knowing that his interests and habits don't align well with Jack, and me warning him of the same. Slowly, they started bickering over nothing which usually turned into huge arguments, and Jack came back at Adrian with ""yo mama"" jokes which made him lose his temper multiple times. 

With time, issues between Adrian, and Jack and Sarah rose till the point they were all fed up with each other, and Jack and Adrian trying to remain civil as roommates. Adrian and Stella had another patchup-breakup cycle and they got back together again recently.  Stella also has some problems with Jack and Sarah but they're not as apparent, or major. 

Recently, Adrian has told me (and Stella), that he won't take it well, and stop talking to us if we were to hang out with Jack and Sarah. I told him that it's unfair, as they are also my good friends. I ensured him that I can make it work such that I can hang out with Sarah and Jack, as well as Stella and him in a way that they won't have to hang out with each other. He claims that he knows he's unfair, and he wouldn't have done it usually but he's just too annoyed to deal with them, and it'll effect our friendship if I were to hang out with them.

I understand their might be deeper issues than I know of, but Adrian has been cutting off people over small things recently since his last breakup with Stella, and I don't want to choose one over the other as all of them are important to me.

83,1cg78rh,AITA for breaking a broken sofa?,"I visited a coworker on Friday night with a couple of work friends for drinks. My coworker has recently hurt his leg and is on crutches. After a couple of beers, we decided to try and balance on his crutches. I ended up slipping and falling on their sofa, which just snapped in half. (I’m not a big guy, weighing about 82 kg.)

Later that night, his girlfriend, and she was very angry. However, we agreed we would figure it out sober in the morning. The day after, I went over to talk to him. He and his girlfriend proposed a solution: I would pay them around $1200 so they could buy a new sofa like their original one. They had owned the original sofa for 6 months, having bought it second hand for around $935. 

I'm currently in school, so money is tight. I told him I wanted to call my insurance company on Monday before they bought the new one, to see if they could cover any of the cost. On Sunday, he sent me a long, passive-aggressive text, saying that he and his girlfriend just wanted it over with, and that I should pay him the $1200 because he wanted it fixed immediately. 

He also thinks it’s very rude of me for trying to find a solution that only benefits me (insurance, fixing it etc.). I then considered hiring a carpenter, as it seemed he didn’t want to go through insurance. The carpenter said they could fix it in about two weeks for about $300. However, they rejected this option, saying it was too much of a hassle. 

It's worth noting that the sofa is still usable; only the lounge part is broken, and it can be disconnected from the rest. Additionally, there's a big red flag indicating that the sofa was already partially broken where it snapped since there is a big piece of wood holding the couch together where the crack has occurred. On the lounge part, the fabric has been visibly cut off. At the breaking point of the sofa, it seems that it may have cracked before and has been patched/reinforced with a separate piece of wood on the side. 

I felt like I was being scammed into buying them a new sofa. I brought this up to them (in an indirect kind of way), but they claimed they had nothing to do with it and that it didn’t matter. They also didn’t want the original fixed because they didn’t want to be in the same situation in the future. It should be noted their sofas original new price of is $2600, but they bought it for $935. 

It's now Monday, and they want me to pay the $935 they paid for the original 6 months ago, plus more towards the new one, totaling $1200, before we report the damage to insurance. However, I only feel comfortable reporting the damage and seeing how much they can cover, and then figuring it out from there before sending them the money. I asked for their information this morning so I could report it, but so far, they won’t give me their information without me sending $935 first.  
  
Tldr, my coworker wants me to give them money before talking to insurance after breaking their partially fixed sofa while drunk.

(Although they never liked his wife and consistently would fight her)
I saw this as extremely disrespectful and I have told my In-laws about how extremely upset I am for sticking with her and never with me.
I got a call from my sil later and she apologized 
And said she never favored anyone,but her brother called her and asked her if she could come to the hospital and stay by his side,and because he called her she couldn’t find it in her to say no so she went and her sisters tagged along.
Although at my first born child my husband called the same sister crying telling her how hard was it for him at that time, because I was in extreme pain ,and because he couldn’t endure staying in the room he went outside to catch his breath and called her, but she never showed up but why is it different when it comes to my BIL.
Note: they would go to my BIL house while she was pregnant and would clean for her while she’s asleep and would even take the garbage out and mop the whole house for her and they never did that for me never checked on my well being while I was pregnant never came by to help me clean I would do everything on my own.
Am I over reacting?

88,1cg6c88,WIBTA for not accepting my parents money on my wedding,"I (28M) am getting married in exactly 12 months. My GF and I have been saving some money for it in the last year, and thankfully, we have the complete budget already in our bank account. So it is safe to say we are quite ""confortable"" with the expenses.

The thing is that my parents are insisting that they are willing to help us pay for maybe 20 to 30% of the wedding costs. It might sound like a bargain, but there Is a catch.

With money, my parents are kind of difficult, and feel like they are entitled to have power over me or my decisions, and start making comments that I really dislike. For example, even after ten years, they live constantly reminding me how much they paid for my high school education (I live in Latin America, and here is very normal to have private education), and even if they do not do it on purpose, I feel like I ""owe"" this money to them.

In the past, I even had lent money to my parents (a big amount for how much I was earning back then), and to the day, they have never paid me back. And they never did a single thing to start paying me back (like giving me in small amounts or something like that). And when I asked them about it, they were just putting excuses.

So, I don't know if I would be the AH if I just refuse to accept the money from my parents because I don't want them to feel entitled to have all this comments on ""how much they spent on me"".

Or should I just invent an excuse on not accepting the money?

When my husband and I started dating I tolerated their jokes (about my culture), jokes that is sometimes below the belt, their passive agressive comments, unsolicited/condescending advise, etc.

After our wedding, I started seeing a therapist as I had panick attacks whenever we are going to see my in-laws (couldn't breath panick attacks), I was also going to grief counseling as my mental health was taking a toll on me at that time... 

My therapist suggested to communicate to my husband what I was feeling towards his family. 

It did not go well. It took years of marriage counseling before my husband can understand where I am coming from, and REALLY respect my boundaries.

We decided and he laid out our boundaries to his family. I was no longer coming to family events at his hometown. The family events we are hosting, they are welcome to come unless they are uncomfortable and we respected it.

It did not go well with the inlaws. My sister in law will call her Marcie threatened that if I don't have a relationship with them, then I shall not have a relationship with her children.

Honestly, it is the bed I made, and I was happy to lay in it.

I told my husband I understood and I will not stop any of my inlaws to have a relationship with my children.

Through the years, my husband always invites his side of his family whenever we have an event at our house. My children's birthdays, and other occasions. My inlaws never come aside from my husband's mother, but rarely. 

For the record, I always encourage my husband to visit his parents/family. Mother's day, father's day, etc. I just don't feel comfortable around them but i don't want to be unfair to my husband and children.

Through the years, whenever my inlaws send their invitations or cards, it is only addressed to my husband.

My son is graduating high school this year. I was doing the envelopes last weekend when my son made a comment. ""Why are you inviting Aunt Marcie? She's not coming anyways and she's drama, don't waste your postage"". 

I talked to my husband about it and he was surprised with my son's comment. When we talked about it with my son. He simply said, he does not care, if his Aunt will come or not. But, he rather not have a drama at his graduation party. If that's gonna be the case then he rather not have it.

I agreed with my son and decided not to invite my SIL. My husband said I would be an ahole if I don't invite his brother's wife.

We have a good relationship now, friendly but no romantic feelings left at all. It was a mutual decision and we both knew that it wasn't working out. So far so good. 

I met my actual soulmate recently (a year after the breakup) and we are getting married next summer. We have been living together for 6 months now, so we know this is right.

      I am scheduled 50 hours a week (5 ten hour days), as is the GM, however,  we close when my schedule is supposed to end and I have to stay 30-45 minutes to clean and close the system. so really I'm there almost 11 hours. the gm is NEVER there till the end of their shift. they say they're at different locations but I really think that's not always true. 
      on numerous occasions, I have had multiple call outs in one shift and my boss wouldn't even tell me. or make up something about car trouble but they're coming just to pacify me. 
      my boss has taken night shift people off their shift to work day time to help them out and just leaving me with one less body. 
      Last week there was an $80 shortage which my boss ultimately decided by counting what the actual safe showed was deposited, that the safe malfunctioned and the amount deposited and the total were not showing the same. well I guess my job said that's 100% not possible but they can easily justify a bank malfunction where one of my deposits was actually for the day before so yeah I'm still short, it's on me, and now I get a write up for the 80 bucks. AND when I walked in I overheard my boss's boss saying my job is on the line. 
     not allowed to turn lobby lights off to slow business down at night to actually get out close to my scheduled time but I am told that they do the same thing
     ive been outwardly disrespected and asked to not work with people and I've been totally disregarded. (the person was a rehire who was fired for physically assaulting someone)
      yesterday I wasn't even given a late night cashier so on top of already having to do everything closing wise, I was stuck in drive thru till the last second taking orders. I messaged the group chat that this was getting old and I'm tired of having no one on my shift. my boss called me and their resolution was to list everyone who was scheduled, which I already knew. they also told me Sundays aren't busy even though myself and others have been telling them how busy Sundays have been for like the past month.

93,1cg5jga,"AITA for asking newer lake friends who don't understand boundaries respect them, because it feels like they're stalking us?","My husband and I have a lake home. We've been there almost 4 years. In that time, we've become good friends with a few other households on our corner of the lake. Some of our group is quite outgoing... always meeting new people in our lake community and being welcoming, us included. Everyone's awesome, but one couple has become problematic.  

Last year we met Roger and Helene, who have a seasonal cottage on a different part of the lake. They're around weekends. They check-in with us/our friend group when in town, or stop by unannounced. This is fine. What's hard is they want to get together all of the time, and don't seem to accept it when we tell them we're busy. They get in their boat, drive over to our area, and anchor straight in front of our properties. It makes everyone uncomfortable. They'll stay there for an hour +. If we're working in the yard, they'll repeatedly go by, telling us to quit working to join them. Other times, when at the campfire, they'll dock their boat at one of our docks, then join us at the fire - without the invitation. They'll also drive or walk over from their place to check up on us, even after being told we're not available.

When we're in our boat they'll drive theirs over and say ""Let's tie up the boats"" - so we can hangout on the water together. Normally, it's fine, except for when we're hosting guests. We've struggled with how to say no. My husband and I would never say ""Let's tie up"" to other boaters. We would swing by, say hello, then see if we're invited. If not, we move along. That's protocol, but it's lost on Roger and Helene. 

Recently, out-of-town friends who have been to the lake a few times declined our invitation to visit, citing that they don't like the visits being interrupted by the neighbors, specifically Roger and Helene. Our core friend group is very respectful about visitors, so we knew who was the issue. Our corner of the lake complains about these two all the time and has struggled with how to handle their constant orbiting. Having a visit invitation turned down because of them made me extra annoyed.  

Soooo, 2 weeks ago we were on our pontoon with friends, when Roger and Helene showed up and said, ""Let's tie up!"" We'd already told them we were busy via text when they checked in. But apparently, they just couldn't resist coming out when they saw us. Being extra annoyed, I finally spoke up, ""Sorry, we're good. We're entertaining. We'll have to get together another time."" 

Later, I got an angry text from Helene. She said I was rude and embarrassed them. I texted back saying I was sorry they felt that way, but they needed to respect when we're busy, and that at times my husband and I felt stalked. Haven't heard from them since. A couple of our core friends say I shouldn't have said anything; that their stalking isn't a big deal, they're nice... This is surprising and upsetting me.

95,1cg5fc0,AITA for flirting friends while on dr*GS ?,"I am on mobile and it's a throwaway account, english isn't my first langage. 


Everything began two months ago in techno parties in my city. In those parties all my friend's take m*lly, we all kiss each other and never judge any of us for everything we say or do on those parties because we know we are on drugs. So it was a safe place for me. We said to eachother that if we do something wrong, we should talk about it right away so we know the limit we should'nt cross. 


I started going to these parties with my best friend Eduard who intruduced me to his group of friends, including Lana with whom I became really close, she is a really good person.
However, at the last techno party, I've said many things to Saïd, Lana's boyfriend. And as I heard, I' ve told many things to Lana and her friends too. Apparently, I suggested threesome, showed my flipside with sexy pictures to Saïd and things like that. In a previous party she said if she wasn't with Saïd she would be with me, she kissed my crush and me and other people because that's what we do in those parties and I'm totally fine with it. At the moment, everything was doing well, everybody enjoyed the party and we all came home together. I've talk to Lana many times after and it was fun & fine.


After this party I talk to Eduard about what I did about the flipside thing and he said I shouldn't do that again but it wasn't a big deal.
I went on a trip and thought I should talk to Lana about that when I come back. 
Before I came back I recieved a text of Lana saying that I'm sexually devious and she doesn't want to have anything to do with me ever again, that nobody in the friend group want to see me again, that I crossed the limit.


I really regret but I don't think it's fair to call me sexually devious.

96,1cg4vnm,AITA for telling my parents they can't make me invite friends over?,"I (16m) don't invite my friends over to my house anymore. It's been just over a year and my parents are only really noticing that I just outright stopped. The reason for me stopping is my younger sister (12f). She's on the spectrum and talks a lot. You can't have a conversation with her, she doesn't do well with that and her social skills are really bad, you just have to listen. But she can talk for hours without stopping and her special interests are always her topic. It's too much to listen to non-stop but stopping her makes her upset. She would come into my room or into the game room when I had friends over and talk. It meant we couldn't talk to each other without talking over her and it bored them and made them uncomfortable because they witnessed how upset she'd get when I asked her gently to stop talking or tried changing the subject and told her we needed to talk about other stuff.

My parents typically pawn my sister off on me when they grow tired of listening to her talk. They expect me to deal with it. But the older I get the less patience I have to listen like that for so long. So they liked when I had friends over because it was more people to listen to my sister. Now that my friends no longer come over they're annoyed that she talks more to them because I don't spend as much time at home.

On Saturday my parents asked why I never bring my friends over anymore and I told them we do other stuff now that we can't do at home. They said it was odd that it happened so abruptly and I shrugged. They told me I should invite my friends over some more. I told them I didn't want to and they pressed why. I told them it didn't matter and they said it did because it was more people for my sister to socialize with, sorta. I told them it wasn't up to my friends to listen to my sister for hours at a time so they (my parents) could get a break. My parents told me I will invite them over. I said they can't make me invite friends over. My parents told me of course they can and I should be less rude to them. They also told me it's cruel to deny my sister this.

We live very far from them so when they do visit, I genuinely enjoy spending time with them, and encourage the bonds they have with our kids.

Their visits are typically 6-8 weeks and when they leave, we're sad for a few days, but quickly adapt to being a nuclear family in our own space again. 

I'm not sure if it's because it's just the two of them in their home, boredom, jealousy of the time my parents have with the grandkids (who also live very far from us), or a combination of all three, but my MIL has been spending at least half the past year with us and pushing for more frequent visits alone. 

I thought it was just me overthinking things but my wife brought it up recently and asked me if I was okay with her mom being around more frequently.

99,1cg4fn2,"AITA for refusing to give ""my car"" to my brother","I(19F) don't know how to explain this adequately but before I turned 18 my parents applied for a type of financing/loan common in my country in order to buy me a car. I didn't particularly want a car but it was a nice gesture and I figured if nothing else I could just give it to my parents or something. Usually, the process of being granted it takes years, but by some inexplicable luck I was drawn some months ago. 

My oldest brother (32M) has recently married and had a baby, and moved to a farm to start a business of caring for horses. To be clear I love my brother and support his new life endeavors. However, I have watched all my life him being irresponsible with money and he is actually currently in quite some financial trouble, and it has been disclosed to me that he has about 70% of his income (he's a cop) compromised by multiple loans and the expenses of renting and renovating the farm. I also consider him a really reckless driver and he often gets tickets and fines. Since he needs an additional car, he has also applied for the same type of financing/loan that I did but it hasn't been picked yet.

Now, with all the recent change in his life, my parents are trying to help him and his situation as much as possible, so my mom (50F) talked to me about giving him my financing/loan. I had no problem with this, since I don't plan on using it. However, my mom informed me that the plan was that the car would be bought on my name and that while he would use it, the car would still technically be mine. 

Now. I love my brother, but I don't think it's smart for my name to be on something that is used by someone that I consider to be reckless/unreliable. So I told my mom that I would only do it if the car was transferred to his name. My mom informed me however that transferring it to him would cost a whole lot of money that they weren't willing to pay. Today, she sent me a contract for me to sign for the acquisition of the car in question, and I told her I don't feel comfortable signing it. 

My mom is mad at me for this one and is saying I am not being a good sister. She also brings up that it is her money that is on the line so it should be her decision.

103,1cg3qnc,AITA Couple’s finance split disagreement,"Recently, my SO (26f) of 7 years and I (26m) have had a disagreement on how to manage our finances.
Two years ago, when we both started a 3 year full-time studies program at the same time, she made the decision that she did not want to work to completely focus on her school and I decided to work full time at the same time as my studies. The difference being that she was okay with being in debt from school and paying it off later, while I wanted to finish school debt-free. 

Since that decision, our arrangement was that everytime she was not able to contribute her half to our joint account for expenses, I would lend that half and add it to a tab that she would pay in full as soon as she finished her studies (she would borrow the amount from the bank only then and reimburse it whenever she wanted). The point of me lending the money to her with no interest was to spare her from paying the 8% rate on her student credit line.

Yesterday, she came to me asking me to remind her what the arrangement was and when I reminded her, she said she disagreed with this view on couple’s finance. Her point was that after 7 years together, we should be sharing everything and she expected me to clear off the 20k of debt she owes me at this point and keep helping her without adding to a debt.

What bothers me is that even though I agree with the reasoning on sharing everything in a relationship, I feel like I should not have to be in a situation where I’m sacrificing so much while she doesn’t. Her point of view is that she is genuinely trying her best to do the most and that she simply does not have the capacity to do both as I am doing. The empathy in me makes me want to understand and contribute more if I truly am more lucky with my capacity to do so. But I also feel like I am getting completely taken advantage of. I feel very conflicted. I feel like I am in no position to truly know if she actually is trying her best or being complacent/lazy but I also dont feel like I can just believe her that easily.

What I liked about our arrangement was that it allowed me to be okay with her spending lots of time on relaxing and leisure since she was the one that was going to have to deal with the consequences later.

I was thinking on reducing the debt in recalculating it with a 60/40 split instead of 50/50 and to keep that split moving forward. It wont make a huge difference but I feel like any more than that might make me resent her in an unhealthy way.

I would love to hear your perspective.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-29,"AITA Couple’s finance split disagreement Recently, my SO (26f) of 7 years and I (26m) have had a disagreement on how to manage our finances.
Two years ago, when we both started a 3 year full-time studies program at the same time, she made the decision that she did not want to work to completely focus on her school and I decided to work full time at the same time as my studies. The difference being that she was okay with being in debt from school and paying it off later, while I wanted to finish school debt-free. 

Since that decision, our arrangement was that everytime she was not able to contribute her half to our joint account for expenses, I would lend that half and add it to a tab that she would pay in full as soon as she finished her studies (she would borrow the amount from the bank only then and reimburse it whenever she wanted). The point of me lending the money to her with no interest was to spare her from paying the 8% rate on her student credit line.

Yesterday, she came to me asking me to remind her what the arrangement was and when I reminded her, she said she disagreed with this view on couple’s finance. Her point was that after 7 years together, we should be sharing everything and she expected me to clear off the 20k of debt she owes me at this point and keep helping her without adding to a debt.

104,1cg3eib,AITA for telling a woman she looks well despite just giving birth?,"This was a brief exchange between a woman (late 20s/early 30s) and I (late 20s M).

After nearly bumping into me on the stairs this conversation happened, but was very quick and mostly took place whilst we continued to walk in opposite directions.  
  
Woman: (giggles) Opp, sorry, baby brain! I've only just given birth and have only popped in to get something.  
  
Me: No worries! How's it going? You're looking well, my sister looked exhausted for months! (laughs)

Woman: (pulls her face inwards) Uh, we shouldn't have to look well after giving--

Me: Oh, no, sorry, I didn't mean it like--

Woman (We were further apart so it wasn't clear, but something along the lines of): Mmm, it can come across as a little sexist.

  
Was I in the wrong here? She did took totally well in terms of hair, make-up and clothes and she seemed bubbly before I complimented her so it was surprising to hear she'd just given birth and I assume still on maternity. It was just a quick comment from me so maybe I could have worded it better or not said it at all? I'm getting mixed responses from both male and female friends on whether it was appropriate or not.

Thanks

106,1cg2yqg,AITA for warning my father's new girlfriend about his racist behavior?,"Hey. I (15F) have been noticing things about my father (50M) recently.

He's a white man, and since divorcing my mom, he's only ever dated women of color. Which is fine with me. We live in an area where most people are poc, even, so his dating habits aren't too weird on their own.

The problem is the 'jokes' he makes about his girlfriends when they aren't looking. When he had a hispanic girlfriend, he mocked her accent and food. When he had an asian girlfriend, he mocked her 'traditional asian parenting' and her celebrating traditional holidays. When he had a black girlfriend, he mocked her natural hair. When he had a native american girlfriend, he made 'pocahontas' and 'indian princess' jokes relentlessly.

Some of them got angry about these jokes while others would uncomfortably laugh them off, but I could tell none of them were really comfortable with the jokes he made. Sometimes it seems like he dates them just to put them down and then dump them. I hate it. 

Well, yesterday he brought home a girl from India who he apparently met last week. When he was out of the room, I pulled her aside and gently warned her about how he treated his previous girlfriends who weren't white because I didn't want her to date him not knowing how he is until he starts belittling her too. She got really quiet and made up an excuse to leave a few minutes later.

Apparently she hasn't talked to him since yesterday, and my brother felt bad for him and decided to tell my dad what I said to her. So now my dad is angry at me for thinking so little of him and interfering in his love life. 

I was pretty confident that I did the right thing, but my mom and brother both think I should have just kept my mouth shut, and my dad is really angry, so now I'm double guessing myself and whether it was my place to step in.

107,1cg2hr2,WIBTA if I didn't put my father in the dedication of my book?,"Throwaway account because my sibling knows my main.

Basically, a year ago I managed to write and publish a book. It isn't The Book (TM) or anything, but I'm proud of it! It's been a longtime wish of mine.

While I was writing it, one time I was in the car with my mom (who didn't know at that time that I was writing it) and a song played. Said song is dedicated to the mother of the singer, so I said so to my mom. She jokingly said: ""well, let's see when you publish a book and dedicate it to me!"". We both laughed, but I \*knew\* I could do the funniest thing ever. So I did!

When my book got published, my family read the dedication. It was for my grandpa, who died shortly before, and to my mom, referrencing that conversation. I don't know if she remembered it, but she was very happy. My father... well...

In that moment, he didn't say anything about it, but a couple of weeks later, my mom told me that my father said that he didn't understand why he wasn't included and that he was hurt. I was a bit surprised because if he had asked me directly, I'd have told him this same story. It's really not that deep. However, my mom told me that, now I need to write and publish another one so I can put my father on it. I do have another manuscript ready to send around to publishing houses, but it's a darker story that I feel should be dedicated to no one.

I'm afraid that if this second manuscript ever gets published and it is not dedicated to my father, it will stir shit. At the same time, I think that dedications are very personal and I should be able to choose whether to add one and, if I do so, who to dedicate the story to.

So... WIBTA if I don't dedicate the next manuscript to my father?

Edit 1: I've seen it in several comments so I wanna clarify two things. The first one is that the dedicatory to my mom isn't a joke! It was more of a ""haha, got ya, you really got that dedicatory"" situation. She has always supported me in my writing hobby so regardless of the car anecdote, she would have gotten it anyways. The car anecdote was just an excuse and something I referenced in the dedicatory itself.

The second thing I wanna clarify is that, no, my father had no active part in this. He never made me stop writing or said a bad word about me writing. He also never actively supported me (for instance, I know he almost never read my short stories, whenever I send them to him. It's not his thing, I get that!). I'm also almost certain that he did not react the manuscript for my first book prior to it being published (I send it to my family so that they would beta read it).

108,1cg2fs7,WIBTA/Breaking trust,"WIBTA?

I 26f have a cousin 16m who talks to me regularly. I'm someone he can trust and feels comfortable talking to, as I don't do anything to break his trust. This time, I feel it might have to be different because I'm honestly concerned. His dad (my uncle - who has also been my biggest confidant for years) has custody, his mom is so flaky that she might as well not be in the picture, and she's never really cared about what he does - even when she had custody. 

So the kid has some issues he wants to work through, but he's going about it in a reckless way.

He has come to me before and talked, but he has never mentioned these things. When playing outside with the little kids at a family cookout yesterday, I noticed he had carved something into his arm - at this point it was a pretty gnarly scar. I quietly asked him about it, and he said he would talk to me about it later. He said his dad knows about that cut, but not all of the others that he has inflicted upon himself and continues to do once in a bluemoon. 

He also mentioned that he's using a vape, that he has a couple and is getting a new one from a friend at school with higher nicotine content.

Now, I know kids experiment - I was a teenager too. I did behaviors similar because I was confused and needed some professional help. Call it a cry for help if you will, I didn't see it that way when I was a teenager. But as an adult and a parent to a 4yo boy myself, I would want to know if my child was mentally suffering so bad that he was feeling self-destructive and needed help. 

So, with that being said, would it make me an asshole for breaking his trust and going to his dad? I don't really think so, maybe I see it as being protective. He might be mad at me and not confide in me anymore, but I care more about his safety and well-being. Can anyone lend me some advice on how to approach this? That might be the bigger question here.

Thanks in advance.

UPDATE:
I talked long and hard with my cousin about this today. It came down to that he isn't ready to tell his dad everything, but he did ask him about counseling options. He goes in for his first appointment next week to work on getting some help ❤️ he did say that when he is ready to talk to his dad, he would like for me to be there.

I’ve more recently discovered I’m pregnant and planning on keeping it. I’ve told my friends and one of those friends, I’ll just call “M”, has been very very excited for me.

It was fine in the beginning but now she’s starting to practically act like she’s the baby’s father. 

She will insist on buying items for the baby even if I don’t need or want them and if I refuse, get really upset and call me ungrateful.

Refer to the baby as either ‘hers’ or ‘our’ baby. 

Is really obsessed with knowing the gender once I can, really wants it to be a boy for some reason.

Staying over at my apartment more and more and has offered to let me stay in her house which has a bit more space, like really insisting. She has shown me pictures of nursery’s that she’d like to do for ‘her’ baby.

Posting ‘updates’ and photos constantly, like some people thought she was the pregnant one.

I kinda got tired of it all lately and when she was talking about something baby related I snapped and called her a crazy bitch. Of course, an argument ensued and she left my apartment. 

She has told our mutual friends about what I said so I’m getting called a AH and heat for it. Starting to wonder if I’m really just being rude /TA.

111,1cg20o5,AITA for being toxic towards my 72 y/o grandmother who pays for everything I do?,"I (23F) just moved to Greece with my grandma (who is from there originally). We have a long history together; she raised me and has practically paid for everything that I do as a single parent. I've never had a job before because ""school comes first,"" and seeing as I am applying to a masters program, I have no money to do so. She has given me a 24k budget for tuition, housing, food, travel, etc for an entire year total. Which, in retrospect I should be grateful for (and I am... incredibly). But at what cost? I never noticed it until I left for college, but our relationship is very toxic and at times she can be very emotionally and verbally abusive when she doesn't get her way. I feel like she always holds the fact that she is funding me over my head, and that nothing I ever do will be good enough unless it's exactly how she wants. (Here is 1 of the many examples) I have a very estranged relationship with my mom, but in an effort to mend things, I invited her to my senior dance performance, my grandma thought I was paying more attention to my mom and spending more time with her, so she called my dad behind my back and told him some elaborate story, which made him call me and biitch me out that I ""hurt her feelings."" Which I can acknowledge is true, but was was completely unintentional. Thus, then I tried to rekindle things with my mother, again in college (by inviting her to my graduation as a first gen student) I was shut down and told that it would be a bad idea because my grandma would throw a fit behind closed doors, and it would only just stress me out on a day that's supposed to be about me.

I (23F) just moved to Greece with my grandma (who is from there originally). We have a long history together; she raised me and has practically paid for everything that I do as a single parent. I've never had a job before because ""school comes first,"" and seeing as I am applying to a masters program, I have no money to do so. She has given me a 24k budget for tuition, housing, food, travel, etc for an entire year total. Which, in retrospect I should be grateful for (and I am... incredibly). But at what cost? I never noticed it until I left for college, but our relationship is very toxic and at times she can be very emotionally and verbally abusive when she doesn't get her way. I feel like she always holds the fact that she is funding me over my head, and that nothing I ever do will be good enough unless it's exactly how she wants. (Here is 1 of the many examples) I have a very estranged relationship with my mom, but in an effort to mend things, I invited her to my senior dance performance, my grandma thought I was paying more attention to my mom and spending more time with her, so she called my dad behind my back and told him some elaborate story, which made him call me and biitch me out that I ""hurt her feelings."" Which I can acknowledge is true, but was was completely unintentional. Thus, then I tried to rekindle things with my mother, again in college (by inviting her to my graduation as a first gen student) I was shut down and told that it would be a bad idea because my grandma would throw a fit behind closed doors, and it would only just stress me out on a day that's supposed to be about me.

114,1cg1rco,"AITA for ""grounding"" my adult sister?","I (25F) live in a three bedroom apartment with my fiancé (27M). We have a six month old son.

My younger sister Mia (fake name; 20F) recently started attending a university that's closer to where I live than both my parents' places. Because she needs to get to class early in the morning, my fiancé and I allowed her to move into our spare bedroom. She's been living with us since January.

There's a set of rules I've been having Mia follow since she moved in, mostly to make sure everyone can live peacefully. One of the most important rules concerns arriving after my son's bedtime (usually between 19h and 20h). Mia is allowed to come home however late she wants, as long as she doesn't make too much noise.

The door to the apartment has an electronic keypad lock, and the one we use also has a normal lock under it. Everyone has a copy of the key, but we all prefer typing in the password. However, the keypad is very noisy, and my son's nursery isn't far from the door. Every time the keypad is used after I've put the baby to sleep, he wakes up.

So naturally, the rule about getting home late includes not using the keypad. Everyone, including Mia, has known about this since day one.

At first, we had no problems. But now that Mia has gotten used to college life, she's been going out at night frequently. This past month, she has arrived home after midnight every Friday and Saturday night. She always forgets the ""don't make too much noise"" rule, and she has, on multiple occasions, used the keypad. My son wakes up crying every. Damn. Time.

I'd sit her down and remind her of the rule whenever this happened, but she'd continue to do it. My fiancé and I got tired of putting our baby back to sleep because of that, so I changed the password and told Mia she was no longer allowed to use the keypad. She agreed, and promised to try to make less noise.

On Friday night this week, Mia went out with her friends. She came home very drunk at 4AM, and forgot that I'd changed the password. Not only did she use the keypad, she also got the password wrong so many times that she triggered an alarm.

I was furious. Not only did my baby wake up crying, but I also got complaints from my neighbors.

The next morning, I told Mia that I'm establishing a curfew: while living with me, she needs to be home by 20h. She won't be allowed to go out at night for the rest of the semester.

Mia put up a fight, saying I have no right to ""ground"" her **(EDIT: I never used that word)** like this or dictate what she does with her free time, but I held my ground. I told her she'll be free to do as she pleases when she has her own place and raises her own family. While living with mine, she has to do as I say.

She told our parents about this. Our mother and stepfather are both on my side; our father is on Mia's. He's saying I'm not her mother, and I have no right to treat her like a child. He also thinks it's unfair to do this to her over a drunken mistake.

119,1cg0oh0,AITA that I exploded to my mother? ,"Haii, good day! This is a throwaway account and English isn't my first language my apologies for any mistakes. 

An hour ago I left a family dinner with my younger brother after I exploded to my mother. She kidnapped us when I was 6 and my younger brother 5, eleven years ago. To this day she believes this wasn't kidnapping because we're her children and she's our mother. Also very stubborn. 

We were arguing about something unimportant I was trying to get done for my younger brother when he told me to drop it, so I did. Immediately after, my mom told me we must just 'listen to their mother,' to her new husband. It sparked another fire in me that, this time, I didn't manage to hold in. I asked her 'We have to listen without being allowed to offer our opinions?' in which she repeated we must just do what she says.

After, I retorted to my mom,' You want us to be your slaves?"" She got defensive, whining about how she was doing so good and great as a mom for us and how we should be more respectful, so I nearly screamed at her: ""Then why do you keep pressing on about issues I've told you many times I don't want because it makes me uncomfortable?"" she always keeps asking every single visit I have with her about when I'm going to sleep over at her house. When I didn't have her phone number yet about when she'd get my phone number. She only gives 50 a month for childcare, too, for each child.

While I had my eyes mostly focused on her as I kept demanding her for an answer she kept trying to deflect back to the previous issue about the small argument, I did manage to see the reaction of the others. My two cousins couldn't understand a thing but looked worried at my mother, her husband (previously tried to keep butting in to help my mother  until my Lil bro told him to shut up and keep out of the argument) was glaring angrily at me, and her husband's friend did too albeit not as furiously. My Lil bro really wanted me to shut up at the beginning too but then let me continue on, probably because this was the first time I refused to listen to him. After we left he told me he was on my side.

But since the other adults were on my mother's side, even though the cousins didn't understand a word I'm like 100% sure they're going to stand by my mother's side, I was wondering if I went too far. My father told me to be kind too (for the last 10 days because we're on a holiday with my mom, another thing I only agreed to because she just kept on asking and asking) after I told him about the situation. I mean, she does try I suppose by gifting us 70 a month and some clothes when we go to her (which is usually once every few months). She tells me often how she cries every time we left her again, and especially when we were angry at her. Back when we were young, I especially wasn't the kindest. I'd often run away from her.

I guess this is more like a: AITA for not being sympathetic to my mother? ",TL;DR,2024-04-29,"AITA that I exploded to my mother?  Haii, good day! This is a throwaway account and English isn't my first language my apologies for any mistakes. 

An hour ago I left a family dinner with my younger brother after I exploded to my mother. She kidnapped us when I was 6 and my younger brother 5, eleven years ago. To this day she believes this wasn't kidnapping because we're her children and she's our mother. Also very stubborn. 

We were arguing about something unimportant I was trying to get done for my younger brother when he told me to drop it, so I did. Immediately after, my mom told me we must just 'listen to their mother,' to her new husband. It sparked another fire in me that, this time, I didn't manage to hold in. I asked her 'We have to listen without being allowed to offer our opinions?' in which she repeated we must just do what she says.

After, I retorted to my mom,' You want us to be your slaves?"" She got defensive, whining about how she was doing so good and great as a mom for us and how we should be more respectful, so I nearly screamed at her: ""Then why do you keep pressing on about issues I've told you many times I don't want because it makes me uncomfortable?"" she always keeps asking every single visit I have with her about when I'm going to sleep over at her house. When I didn't have her phone number yet about when she'd get my phone number. She only gives 50 a month for childcare, too, for each child.

While I had my eyes mostly focused on her as I kept demanding her for an answer she kept trying to deflect back to the previous issue about the small argument, I did manage to see the reaction of the others. My two cousins couldn't understand a thing but looked worried at my mother, her husband (previously tried to keep butting in to help my mother  until my Lil bro told him to shut up and keep out of the argument) was glaring angrily at me, and her husband's friend did too albeit not as furiously. My Lil bro really wanted me to shut up at the beginning too but then let me continue on, probably because this was the first time I refused to listen to him. After we left he told me he was on my side.

120,1cg0fkl,AITA for getting mad and telling my (now ex) boyfriend he’s an alcoholic?,"Me (F25) and my now ex (M27) had been together for almost 5 years. We got together in our early 20s and drank a lot, what most people do in their younger twenties. He has a really close relationship with a lot of guy friends from highschool and has always made it kinda obvious he’d prefer being with them. Now half of the guys are in commited relationships, but there are still a few that encourage him to get really drunk because they think it’s funny. I’m at the point I want to grow up and NOT drink to excess every weekend. 

Me and my boyfriend broke up a few months ago because he had a responsibility to watch our dogs while I was out of town but he blew them off to go out town with his friends and wasn’t going to tell me or find another dog sitter. We also broke up and I kicked him out two years ago because he stood me up on date night without telling me and finally showed up drunk around midnight (after yelling at me and ignoring my calls) after I told him not to drink and drive. (This wasn’t the only problem, I had been dealing with his drinking and choosing his friends for many times prior) We got back together because he claimed he realized he wants to grow up. I thought the past year he was finally getting there. He had only peed the couch once in a few months! Progress, right?

Last I saw him was a month ago because he drank too much (and drove) so I went to talk to him to make sure he was okay mentally. He was blacked out and upset that we had broken up, then told me it was my fault for giving him an ultimatum to either be responsible and stay with the dogs or breakup and go out (for the 3rd night in a row). Then he starts talking about the people in his life that have died and nothing matters. I texted him a few days after and he said he was embarrassed and is going to try and figure it out.  

Well he went out last weekend and ended up drinking so much that his friend refused to take him home, so he had to stay at my friends. He ended up pissing the couch. Keep in mind, he has peed my bed or couch probably around 15 times. And several other friends or hotels beds. Probably around 30 times total. 

He lives with his parents (I never let him move back in when we got together because he didn’t treat the house well, nor did he contribute anything besides occasional groceries) and they don’t think his drinking is a problem. His best friend thinks his problem is that he needs to pee before going to bed (not that he passes out from drinking too much). My ex thinks he has a bladder problem and needs to go to a urologist because of course his problem isn’t the drinking! And I finally said you have a problem with alcohol. They all think I’m being dramatic and I’m just sensitive because my family member is a recovering alcoholic. No one thinks it’s a big deal. Am I the asshole?

Me (19f) and my sister (36) have been keeping horses for about a year with the help of my family and her husband.
Currently my sister owns a 20-ish year old horse (Cloud) while I recently bought a green 5 year old horse(Frida) that is currently being trained after having a few mishaps with previous horses (mostly behavior problems that could not be resolved within our possibilities), however I noticed that my sister really dislikes my trainer and according to her judgment: she is going to ruin my horse but so far my horse is getting significantly better. Still doesn't want my trainer to get anywhere near her horse, but has given me permission to use it after asking permission her or her husband's permission and so far they always said yes even if not completely happy so whenever my trainer wants to go for a hack I just use my bike while she rides my horse and so far everything was quiet.
Yesterday my cousin (whom my sister also hates) wanted to tag along for a hack, and I gave her my bike which, forced me to ask my sister if I could take her horse (I specified I wouldn't let it gallop and let it take a breaks) and she said yes so me, my cousin and my trainer went on with our thing, however while I was away my sister came alongside her husband to the stables and according to my parents they were pretty pissed off and they had an argument, and their conclusions were: everyone is forbidden from riding their horse, Frida is not a suitable horse for me and the only time we can get neat Cloud is to feed, clean and saddle it for my niece. I'd like to remind that during this argument I was not present and if it wasn't for my parents telling me I wouldn't have known about any of this.

So, I wrote a text for my sister reminding her that since she wants to be so possessive about things, it would be good to remind her that my and my parents own the stables and the property, we pay for the water and electricity, we own the equipment they use to ride and, even if we split the costs, I am the ones always making the car ride for hay and feed every two weeks in addition to being the one trying to give my niece the chance to get close to her horse since her mom is terrified.

127,1cfx68z,AITA for not keeping my kid quiet at all times?,"Edit:* just want to thank for all the posts. It's clearly a very split subject. I just want to address some things. 
We did enquire about a carpet, but since we are renting and our landlord is not happy about carpeting near the kitchen which is where the loud section is. Our apartment is thin and long and therefore the kitchen and living area is shared. 
I can try slippers. It's a possibility. He actually does stop running when we say stop, but can forget again as he is 4 and is caught up in his game. Noice cancellation is hard to figure out since it seems to travel along the floor. *


So we live in a big a fairly moden apartment complex in a big city. 
We have a (now this may)4 year old who is like all 4 year olds... Well lively and lovely. 

We got new neighbours nextdoor to us. We share a wall made of concrete. No other neighbours have ever complained, not upstairs or downstairs or on the other side of us. Just the one next door on the left. 
They can't hear anything except for my son's footsteps when he runs across the floor. No other sounds. 

I heard it like a mild set of drums from their side. I get it, that it must be annoying sometimes and when they moved in and complained the first time I said sorry and would tell my son to walk across the particular floor area in our house as quietly as possible. 
We had the neighbours come to our door angry as hell a Sunday afternoon at 12. Because the running was terrible. They treathend to write the administration. 
And now we have the administration telling us they have received complaints about our kid running at all hours of the day. 
Now first of all. My kid is in kindergarten from 8-9 in the morning to 4 late afternoon. Then if the weather is good we are staying out till dinner time. Otherwise we come home and yes we might play a bit and then he goes to bed at 7 with books and sleeps. So even if we go directly home it's maximum an hour's worth of potential running. We also have told him multiple times to try and walk slowly across the floor. But sometimes he yells: "" I have to pee/poop"" 
So he runs out to the bathroom. (No one wants to stop a popping kid) 

Sometimes he gets scared in the middle of the night and runs into our bed. Which might be disturbing, but I'm sleeping so I don't know what to do.

We are also out every 2 Sunday for family dinner til bedtime. We try to be out every Saturday for family fun or playdates but it's not every weekend, because we also just want to be home and relax. 

I told the neighbours and administration this and that I refuse to live my life in fear of my neighbours. And it feels like they are breathing down our necks.
We live in an apartment complex, we get to hear each other. We hear drilling, people, party music. We accept that others live here. Telling my kid every 5 minutes to walk slower also seems like trying the impossible. 
Here is where I might be the idiot. I told my neighbour the last time she came up complaining, that she was welcome to invest and go Half's on a massive carpet for our apartment and other soundproofing. She huffed and threatened the administration once more.

Am I the asshole neighbour? ",No A-holes here,2024-04-29,"AITA for not keeping my kid quiet at all times? Edit:* just want to thank for all the posts. It's clearly a very split subject. I just want to address some things. 
We did enquire about a carpet, but since we are renting and our landlord is not happy about carpeting near the kitchen which is where the loud section is. Our apartment is thin and long and therefore the kitchen and living area is shared. 
I can try slippers. It's a possibility. He actually does stop running when we say stop, but can forget again as he is 4 and is caught up in his game. Noice cancellation is hard to figure out since it seems to travel along the floor. *


So we live in a big a fairly moden apartment complex in a big city. 
We have a (now this may)4 year old who is like all 4 year olds... Well lively and lovely. 

We got new neighbours nextdoor to us. We share a wall made of concrete. No other neighbours have ever complained, not upstairs or downstairs or on the other side of us. Just the one next door on the left. 
They can't hear anything except for my son's footsteps when he runs across the floor. No other sounds. 

I heard it like a mild set of drums from their side. I get it, that it must be annoying sometimes and when they moved in and complained the first time I said sorry and would tell my son to walk across the particular floor area in our house as quietly as possible. 
We had the neighbours come to our door angry as hell a Sunday afternoon at 12. Because the running was terrible. They treathend to write the administration. 
And now we have the administration telling us they have received complaints about our kid running at all hours of the day. 
Now first of all. My kid is in kindergarten from 8-9 in the morning to 4 late afternoon. Then if the weather is good we are staying out till dinner time. Otherwise we come home and yes we might play a bit and then he goes to bed at 7 with books and sleeps. So even if we go directly home it's maximum an hour's worth of potential running. We also have told him multiple times to try and walk slowly across the floor. But sometimes he yells: "" I have to pee/poop"" 
So he runs out to the bathroom. (No one wants to stop a popping kid) 

Sometimes he gets scared in the middle of the night and runs into our bed. Which might be disturbing, but I'm sleeping so I don't know what to do.

We are also out every 2 Sunday for family dinner til bedtime. We try to be out every Saturday for family fun or playdates but it's not every weekend, because we also just want to be home and relax. 

I told the neighbours and administration this and that I refuse to live my life in fear of my neighbours. And it feels like they are breathing down our necks.

128,1cfwwd2,AITA for keeping my name change a secret for five years?,"So, my (26F) parents decided to name my sister and I after American states. I have permission to share her name (Arizona) and I was called Pennsylvania at birth. Yea, my parents are weird. I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there’s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They’re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic. 

For as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are. 

My sister (28F) didn’t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write ‘Penny’ on my work/books.

When I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend’s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice.

I’m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say ‘I, Penelope’ instead of ‘I, Pennsylvania’.

I invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now.


I know i’m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should’ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would’ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier.

Tldr, parents think I am the AH for keeping this a secret. AITA?

129,1cfwbi0,AITA for wanting to cancell plans with a friend?,"I (F27) made plans to go on a weekend trip with my friend (F25), and two other people (her friend and her mum). The main event will be a concert that she is super-hyped about. This city-trip is about 3 months ahead. The tickets are already paid for. We were about to book a hotel, however I found out the other trip that I have planned will be moved to another time and collide with my weekend plans.

The other trip was supposed to be 10 days long, to another country, with my dad. My dad always wants to go on any trip really, and was delighted to go together there. I always wanted to go there, but I never really had a chance. First, as a student, I had no money, then my ex bf didn't want to go with me, and last year I booked that trip but it got cancelled. This year I hoped I will finally go there, I booked it via travel agency, but they decided to change the date. 

Now I told my friend that I really want to go to the other trip, that I am really disappointed about the changes and that I would love to go to the concert, but if I have to choose, then I really want to go with my dad... And that of course I will pay for whatever costs were already made in connection to the city-trip. She is upset with me now...

For context: she knew about the 10 days trip before and that I have been planning it since last year really. We visit each other regulary, we used to be pretty close as kids and got closer again in the last two years. We went together on a trip only once, a really long time ago. She didn't leave the house since her child was born about a year ago and that weekend city-trip was important to her. That weekend trip won't get cancelled just because I won't go there. In the (close) past we had some really loose plans to go to together somewhere, but she always cancelled due to being sick or her child being sick, and I completely understand that, it is not within her control. I just think it adds to her frustrations. There are other weekends and trips that we can go to, but I think she might be a bit too angry at me to even consider.

130,1cfwaps,AITA for refusing to give my stepdad the role he wants in my wedding in front of his and my mom's families?,"I'll (27f) be getting married in the next year to 18 months (no date finalized yet). Originally I had planned to have my stepdad and my paternal grandpa share the father of the bride duties because my dad has been dead since I was 6 years old and my stepdad has been there for me almost as long but my grandpa is hugely important and has played the role as most important man in my life after my dad. My stepdad did not want to share the role and he wanted the walk down the aisle and the father/daughter dance to be just us. He told me he was not okay with my grandpa doing either alone or both with him. He told me when it comes down to it he was the real dad in my life since I was 7 years old and while he might not be biologically my dad he has been married to my mom and taking care of me for 20 years and he is also the father to all my siblings and his place in my life should be honored and not shared with a grandparent just because I lost my dad. So I told him I would have just grandpa then.

This was not the end of the conversation and it came back up during my mom's birthday dinner. He mentioned it in front of his family, aka his parents and siblings, as well as my mom and my mom's family. He told me he wanted to be father of the bride, he wanted to walk me down the aisle, he wanted a father/daughter dance, he wanted a toast, he wanted everything that comes traditionally with this. Because he brought it up in front of them and because I was slightly annoyed by him bringing it up again without clarifying he was okay with sharing the role, I told him no again. I also told him I had already asked grandpa. This was in front of both families and it did start a debate over this. Once I realized I was hated for saying no, by his family, and some of my mom's family including my mom disliked that I couldn't let him do it (but some were on my side) I decided to leave.

My stepdad told me I had humiliated him and made the dinner all about me. I said he brought it up first and he told me kindness and decency would suggest I not turn him down in front of everyone. I also got a very angry message from one of his siblings and another from the same sibling on behalf of his parents. They told me I had no business treating him this way. When I didn't reply to this person either time my stepdad told me I was going out of my way to behave inappropriately and to hurt him.

The importance of my paternal family in my life has always been an issue for my stepdad and his family, but especially the importance of grandpa. For many years my stepdad has been jealous and his family has commented that I shouldn't need my grandpa because I have my stepdad. His family have expressed their dislike for me several times because I have the relationship with grandpa that they feel I should have with their son.

My stepdad expected an apology and when he didn't get one. He told me yet again that he didn't like my behavior at the dinner.

131,1cfw78l,AITA for snapping at my friend because of her comments about my body?,"I’m F19 and my friend Jenna is F18. Jenna is obsessed with being “thicc.” She’s always taking about how “thicc” she is and how that’s a great trait of hers and it’s frequent enough that it’s annoying but I always just ignore it.

In the past few months she’s started commenting on my body too though. For context I’ve always been thin and have a medical condition that makes it harder for me to gain or retain weight. I feel that my body is proportional and I’m not flat anywhere. I’m happy with my body but I’ve also been working hard to try to build muscle which is more difficult for me than most people and Jenna knows this.

She keeps commenting on how I’m not “thicc” and has been steadily increasing how often she brings it up and how rude the comments are. If I mention the gym she’ll ask if I’m hitting lower body to “get thicc.” She's asked how my boyfriend even enjoys sex with me because I “have no butt” and she asked this in front of him.

Last Friday I made the mistake of going clothes shopping with her and I tried on a really cute pants/tank top set that I loved and had decided to treat myself and get. When I showed it to Jenna in the fitting room though, her immediate response was “it doesn’t make you look thicc.”

I told her I didn’t care about looking “thicc” and that I really liked the set but she doubled down and was like “well yeah but of course you’d rather look thicc though” and commented on the side profile of my butt in the pants. I repeated that I didn’t care and she doubled down and told me not to get the set because I could find something that made me look actually thicc. I got the set anyway and the rest of the evening, Jenna kept making incessant comments about my body. For what it’s worth Jenna tried on some super unflattering clothes and I didn’t say anything about it because she really liked them.

Eventually I snapped and told her I don’t give a shit about being “thicc” and not to talk to me at all if she can’t bring herself to shut up about the way I look. I told her that sometimes she wears stuff I don’t think is cute but I’ve never commented on it because it’s her choice of clothes.

132,1cfvwy6,AITA: Didn’t want to give an older lady a ride home,"Yesterday after church we stopped at a gas station less than 1 minute from where we live. It was me (31F), my boyfriend (36M, driving) and my 14 month old in the car. I was on my phone and then suddenly he was opening the backseat door to let a middle aged lady (maybe 60 years old?) in with her grocery bags. Apparently she was asking people for a ride home and he accepted. 

On the way there they were chatting and he even pointed out where we live, which really concerned me. She lived quite far away from the gas station and I was surprised she said she walked there, thought it wasn’t more than 5 mins away. 

I was really upset that my boyfriend let a stranger into our backseat with our daughter. The lady was very nice, but these days you have no idea if people are carrying a knife or a gun on them… I told him I wished he could have at least had her sit up front so she wasn’t near our toddler, or dropped us off at home first then went back to get her (that would have taken 3 minutes to do). 

I brought this up to my bf. He got really mad at me for “being un-Christ like” and called me a shit person who lives in fear. I am honestly quite the opposite and usually quite trusting of people, just not when it comes to my daughter. She’s too young to talk or understand things. Also was pissed at home for what felt like weaponizing religion against me for my concern. 

Im feeling really guilty because it’s not that I don’t think it was sweet he wanted to give her a ride home. I just had a mom instinct to protect my daughter. This all led to a huge argument between us. Do you think overreacted? 

Edit: I think the gesture was very compassionate, and understand if someone asks you for a ride then there is obviously a desire to help and bit of awkwardness declining.

Unfortunately I have new neighbours who today experienced a ""big cutting day"" for the first time and they work nightshift all week, every week.

In addition, there is rain predicted for the rest of the week which would bring the project to a standstill if these cuts aren't done.

For clarity, the there is no space available to do this job anywhere else. 
They did the classic threat of being noisy with loud music at 3am when my family is sleeping, to which I reminded them that is actually illegal, where I could be paying a tradesman to do the work and it'd be no different (opposed to starting at 7am). 

They aggressively suggested I do it on weekends, however that is when my family are not at work/school and I'd like to spend time with them. 
In addition, I believe this would negatively impact the most amount of people, with power tools being used when majority are at home.

135,1cfuhp4,AITA for wanting to go on vacation even though my boyfriend can’t?,"Alt account because some friends follow my main and I don’t want them to know about this issue yet.

I’ve been with my bf, I’ll call him Joe, for nearly a near. 

Joe and I have different financial situations (I have more money than him) but it’s never been an issue between us. We always do things he can comfortably afford and split costs. I’m totally fine with this because his company is more important to me than what we do together. 

However, every year since finishing school, my friend group takes a trip to a specific area. It started as an “end of exams” celebration but is now a sort of “kick off of summer” trip. Joe has always known about this trip because I met him right when I got back from it last year. 

I extended the invite to Joe to come along, but explained that there were absolutely no hard feelings about him not coming, since the trip would be far outside his budget (I gave him a rough estimate of how much it would be). Joe got annoyed and said if I really wanted him to come I should try and find a compromise that would allow him to come, such as finding a cheaper hotel that he and I/the whole group could stay in, and planning activities that are suitable for him. I said I’m not going to demand everyone downsize their vacation for him. Joe then said that it will hurt him if I go without him. 

I don’t want to miss this vacation. Apart from the fact that it’s the only time our whole group gets together, I admit I do just want to do something I enjoy, without having to accommodate Joe. I don’t think that’s too much to ask. Yes, we’re a couple but I don’t think that means I can’t go anywhere without him.

I (24m) find myself in a bit of a predicament and I need some unbiased opinions. I lost my job in January, my mum passed away this February and currently, I live in a small apartment with no garden and I am taking a bootcamp course to learn skills for a new job. My girlfriend (22) works, and I'm grateful for her support, especially considering we both struggle with depression and are in therapy. We've volunteered for dog walking at the RSPCA and planned to discuss fostering or adopting a dog after some time.

However, my girlfriend's friend recently had a litter of puppies, two of which are left. They're Patterdale Terriers, and while my girlfriend is eager to adopt one, I have reservations. The dogs are inbred, have never had vet checks or vaccinations, and come from a family living on a tight budget due to disability. Despite their financial struggles, they're giving us the dog for free along with supplies.

My girlfriend is adamant about getting a puppy, but I'm worried about our ability to care for it properly. We're both dealing with depression, financial uncertainty, and I'm grieving for my mum. I've always said we should wait until we have a house with a garden, but now my girlfriend wants to surprise everyone with the dog and doesn't want to tell our families.

Whenever I raise a point, she instantly gets upset and doesn't want to talk anymore, making everything more stressful for me. She also deals with health problems that cause her immense pain, and we have regular trips to A&E as we are worried about the medical problems she has.

While I understand her desire for a dog, I feel it's too soon and not the right time for us. AITA for refusing to adopt a puppy despite my girlfriend's pleas?

Since it is considered rude to send the link to buy whatever you want for your birthday to the attendees (which is stupid  in of itself), I asked them to give me cash, which I could save or get art supplies with.

I was already scared to ask them and my bestie literally had to convince me to ask.  
I said just give me a part of the supplies that I want or some cash (specifically, 1000 rupees, about 11 usd) and he said that my grandmother already gave me the cash and that was from all of the family.

And no, we aren't poor, we aren't rich either but we have a comfortable life and I rarely ask for any gifts or anything, I haven't asked my parents for a bday gift in years. I ask for art supplies or books very occasionally. Often times I am turned down (mainly by my dad but my mom takes his side pretty much always).

I'm 20 years old, and I have a friend named Stacy (that's not her real name), who's 4 years older than me. Stacy often comes to me to complain about her past friendships and how upset she is that her former friends have moved on with their lives after she cut them off. I never really understood why she felt this way, but I always try to help her see that she needs to find healthy ways to cope, rather than wishing ill on people she chose to cut off.

Recently, I posted something on my WhatsApp status, and Stacy responded. However, there was a day when I was really tired, and I thought I had replied to her last message, but it turns out I didn't. Two days later, I noticed my oversight, apologized, and explained that I thought I had replied. A week later, Stacy sent me pictures with some girls I didn't know, and then she sent a message saying she thought she had replied to my response, but had to prioritize the important people first.

That same day, she sent me six voice notes, which I didn't listen to, because she told me she wanted her haters to see her. Since I'd had a day filled with positivity, I suggested that she focus on the love around her instead of her so-called ""haters."" She then sent me a message of a list of things she needed to do: Step 1: she needed to vent; Step 2: she needs to go out; Step 3: she needs to stop being fake towards me, and that I should block her on all social media. I simply replied with a paragraph saying that it's fine, she could block me everywhere, because she had already insulted my character instead of talking to me like a normal human being.

142,1cftm23,WIBTA for keeping the necklace my grandma left to me in her will?,"My grandma passed away about 1 year ago unexpectedly during a heart surgery, and it was very hard on me (26F) since she was really the only grandparent I was ever close to and as I said, her death was quite unexpected. The surgery was a routine surgery with a 98% survival rate. My family history on my dad’s side has been very complicated, and it ended with my grandma and my aunt never speaking again until her death last year, for about 10-15 years. The reason they don’t speak is about money (another story).

I live out of the country and was unable to fly back to the US after her passing (finishing and defending my master thesis). I found out later that my aunt offered to help my dad clean out my grandma’s apartment and storage unit, since she had a lot of things. She was not a wealthy woman and did not own her home, so there wasn’t much money left and I never received any monetary amount. My aunt also invited her daughters to come and go through some of my grandmas clothes, pictures, and jewelry while they cleaned out the house. Her daughters would have met my grandma when they were less than 4 years old, but otherwise had no relationship with her since my aunt and her did not speak.

Honestly, this upset me a bit because they never called or consulted me asking about any of her things or if I wanted anything. My dad said that he tried to pick out some things he thought I would like, including several pieces of jewelry she specifically stated she wanted me to have in her will. The jewelry isn’t anything that worth as much as like a 17 carat diamond, but I think there are still some nice pieces there. I am going this week back to the US to see my dad and receive these things he saved for me, but my aunt called me a few months ago saying that there is a necklace in this collection that she gave my grandma that she would like back.

My aunt used to be a jeweler and said that she hand picked/made this necklace for my grandma a long time ago and it has sentimental value to her.

I live out of the country and was unable to fly back to the US after her passing (finishing and defending my master thesis). I found out later that my aunt offered to help my dad clean out my grandma’s apartment and storage unit, since she had a lot of things. She was not a wealthy woman and did not own her home, so there wasn’t much money left and I never received any monetary amount. My aunt also invited her daughters to come and go through some of my grandmas clothes, pictures, and jewelry while they cleaned out the house. Her daughters would have met my grandma when they were less than 4 years old, but otherwise had no relationship with her since my aunt and her did not speak.

Honestly, this upset me a bit because they never called or consulted me asking about any of her things or if I wanted anything. My dad said that he tried to pick out some things he thought I would like, including several pieces of jewelry she specifically stated she wanted me to have in her will. The jewelry isn’t anything that worth as much as like a 17 carat diamond, but I think there are still some nice pieces there. I am going this week back to the US to see my dad and receive these things he saved for me, but my aunt called me a few months ago saying that there is a necklace in this collection that she gave my grandma that she would like back.

My aunt used to be a jeweler and said that she hand picked/made this necklace for my grandma a long time ago and it has sentimental value to her. However, as I said my grandma specifically asked for this necklace to go to me in her will. So would I be the asshole for keeping the necklace?",0.0,0.08708728104829788,0,1
143,1cfti9k,AITA for choosing not to sleep in the room with my wife tonignt,"Friday night, my son went to bed at his normal time and threw up in bed. Begrudgingly, I got up and took care of things and the rest of the night was uneventful.  In the morning we found up he threw up again over night.  I had already washed the sheets so I put them back on the bed and threw his 2nd set of sheets in the wash.  

That night, Saturday night, my younger daughter threw up in bed.  Once again I was the one that went and cleaned everything up.  I went and found a bowl for her to use in case she threw up anymore.  I think I emptied the bowl 4x throughout the night.  At about 1:30am my wife said she didn't feel well so I found an old mop bucket for her and, just in case, I found a couple buckets for my son and other daughter.  Needless to say I didn't get much sleep Saturday night.  

All day Sunday the 3 girls complain about how terrible they felt and I did everything for them all day.  Made specific meals for them depending on what they had an appetite for, ran to the store (30 mins away) an bought Nyquil, Dayquil, Pepto, pepto tablets, ginger ale and 7up.  Younger daughter continued to throw up periodically until I got the pepto in her.  

Sunday night rolls in.  Gave both my daughters Nyquil and tried to offer some to her.  She said no because she doesn't want to throw it up.  I offered pepto she said no to that because it tastes like chalk.  I told her I had pepto pills and she declined those as well.  So I'm upset already because she won't stop whining but won't take anything to help either.  Then she invites the younger daughter to sleep at the foot of our bed.  I'm annoyed but I decide it's fine.  I decide to cover all my bases.  I make sure everyone has a bowl/bucket and a towel so that I can try and get some sleep.

I get up at about 11:30 to fill my water bottle before I go to bed and I see a light in the hallway.  My oldest looks at me and says ""I feel like I'm going to throw up"" and proceeds to throw up all over the hallway. Now I'm pissed ""Why didn't you throw up in the bucket?! I gave you that bucket,showed you were it was and told you to throw up in that if you felt like you needed to puke!  You literally had to step over the bucket to get here!  Why didn't you grab the bucket?!"" She said ""sorry"" and I said ""it's fine.  Just grab the bucket next time"" and went to bed.  

My wife got up and went to my daughter's room and said something I didn't understand and when she came back in my older daughter was with her. 

W- ""I told her she could sleep in here"" 

Me- ""WTF? Why?! We don't have anymore.room in our bed."" 

W- ""she can sleep on the edge on your side in case she needs to throw up""

M- ""nope.  Eff this.  I'm not sleeping in a room, surrounded by sick people.  I'm sleeping on the couch""

W- ""the F***?!""

I grab my phone charger, CPAP, a pillow and a blanket and leave the room.

144,1cft406,AITA for telling my cousin that her 1 year old toddler shouldn't use smartphones?,"I recently visited my cousin. She has a small 1 year old kid whom she lets use smartphone to watch Tiktok and YoutubeKids. I don't like such small kids be given smartphones, and frankly, think it is harmful. I understand parents getting from work tired but still, the child's brain is at risk

Then my mother called out to the kid, she wanted to talk or play with him. But the kid didn't even budge, constantly looking at the screen as if he couldn't even register the presence. After few minutes he eventually closed the smartphone and went to play with her

I was still alarmed and told my cousin that young kids using smartphones will just ""ruin"" them and that it is obviously not good for the brain. She went defensive and basically told me that one day I too will be a parent and she will wait to see how I deal with my kid. I just replied that I will be responsible and not let my toddler use phones ever.

Sure it's not my child but I just wanted to give an advice. Majority of parents let their very young kids and even younger than that use smartphones, watch tiktok or YouTubeKids on their TV screens, and frankly it's infuriating considering all the research and studies done on the negative effects of the screens.

I need advice. Ill try my best to make as simple/short as possible. 

**Background:**

i grew up in a household in which my dad beat us kids and my mum used to stand around and watch.

my dad got help and came around to actually be an decent father, but my mum has always been super selfish and seems to always be pitted against me. between her and my sister they made fun of me at my 16th birthday, and didn't celebrate my 18th at all, come to my 21st birthday and my mum decides this is the perfect time to renew their vows and uses all available funds ( including my money ) to fund this without a single thanks. its basically a long history of me sacrificing things for her and not even getting a thank you. which also includes saving her from getting fired 3 times. 

My parents have also been terrible with money - always. I have bailed them out more times then i can count, There first house, they borrowed money from my granddad and had to sell the house later as they accrued to much debt to sustain it, and recently they have only been able to buy a property due to my dads parents passing away and leaving him significant inheritance. 

**Current situation:**  
I currently manage a team of care workers for my grandmother, I ensure they are there morning and night. Pay for her food/internet / outings etc.. 

My Grandmother has always been a source a light, growing up her house was warm and homey and filled with so much love. 

When my grandmother passes ( hopefully not for like another 15-20 years , i know I'm dreaming ) her house will be left to my uncle and mum. No issues , I'm not doing any of this expecting anything or any type of compensation. 

Recently i got talking with my Grandmother about her house and realized how much i love it , with this in mind I spoke to mum to discuss the IDEA of me purchasing the house from them when the time arise. 

I am aware that my uncle wants to sell the property as is, ( so no issues there ). When i spoke to my mum though she didn't take a single second to process my request to buy the property (prior to renovations) before saying "" you can buy it at full market rates after renovations""   
What hurts most is that she didn't take a single minute to process or think about my request, as always its all about how much money she can get. 

I wouldn't mind if she had said no, she has he right to deny my request but i hoped with all the effort and energy i put into helping my grandmother/ her she would at least take a second to THINK about it.

Now, I feel hurt and honestly spiteful, I want to make her deal with all the nonsense that comes with handling a team of care workers and finances and having to drop everything cause a care worker is sick and unable to go.

","My (29F) wedding was a week ago, my aunty (61F) and cousin (22F) are staying at my mum's (67F) house while here as they live in a different country. My wedding dress has been at my mum's house before and after the wedding day.

A few days after the wedding, I visited them as I wanted to catch them one last time before my honeymoon. 

While I was there, my aunty was showing me some photos she had taken that week & while swiping I saw a picture of someone in my wedding dress. 

My aunty got really flustered and started swiping quickly so I couldn't see the picture properly. I asked to look at her phone, she gave it to me and I swiped straight to the suss picture - it was my cousin in my dress. 

I have no idea whether this photo was taken before or after the wedding, either way I was completely shocked to see someone else in my dress! 

This dress extremely special to me, my mum and I designed it together, something completely unique to anything we have seen elsewhere. 

I didn't say anything at the time, but I slept on it and decided to text my mum to ask if she was aware what my aunty and cousin did. 

I didn't receive anything back from my mum, but my aunty tried to call immediately. I didn't feel ready to talk to her, so I sent her a text instead. 

I explained that I wasn't upset with my cousin (she's young), I was more upset with my aunty, as a mother I'd think she'd understand the significance, and the fact she encouraged it, taking photo's, not thinking of asking me & then trying to hide it really hurt. 

I honestly think I would have been okay with my cousin trying on my dress, she's like my little sister, but I would have wanted to be there for it, definitely not behind my back. 

My aunty apologised and sounded remorseful in her response, so I was happy to move on. 

A few days later my mum was driving my husband and I to the airport for our honeymoon & I asked my mum if she knew at the time what my aunty did, I didn't think for a second that she would have known - I assumed she'd understand how disrespectful it'd be to do this behind my back.

Turns out my mum knew the whole time - instead of just apologising & moving on, she started crying and getting really defensive. She said ""it's (Aunty's) fault for taking those photo's"" and accused me of being a AH for making them feel so bad about it. 

I snapped a little at this point and raised my voice, I asked her to take accountability instead of deflecting the blame.

They do not use coasters on the wooden coffee table that belongs to me (pretty much every piece of furniture in the shared spaces are mine, since I had already been here for a couple years, but I have always said that anything is welcome to be used as long as they are taken care of), so now I have stains from where their drinks left rings on my table. There are other examples here and there. Anything like this I try to communicate, she pushes it back onto me as “complaining,” and as nitpicks against her. She even went as far as to say that I can’t handle roommates, which I have had plenty: some great and some not so great. She, however, has never lived with a roommate before. She calls me rude when I have never said anything against her personally, but she takes everything personally. No owning up to her faults.

153,1cfrv06,AITA if I don’t want to delete acc with dead friends messages ,"So as the text states my gf (17) and me m(17) are at the breaking point of our 1+ yr relationship over my old fb acc. 

For context at the beginning of our relationship she would feel that I’d prioritize my friends over her, which admittedly I did. I felt like I was balancing my personal life and relationship by separating them a bit. I would spend the majority of the time with them and stay out late. In doing this I was also poor at communicating to her what I was doing at the time. Only telling her I was “chillin”, wouldn’t tell her where I was going, or who I was with. In hindsight this was absolutely the most stupid thing I could do. It’d be the same 2 guy friends and I’d assume she’d know but this just led to a huge amount of trust issues. I no longer hangout with them. It’s gotten to the point where I cannot talk to my female coworkers other than a nod or mhm. If there’s any female on my feed even if it’s just them with a chunk of text or their opinions it’s a still a female. If I don’t ignore my coworkers or hit uninterested then she takes it as disrespect. She only takes it this way because of how big of an clear she’s made it. I understand that these are her boundaries only because of how I’ve fucked up in the past. 

I don’t want it to seem like I’m painting her as this control freak for no reason, I’ve kind’ve forced her into this position. These aren’t all the examples just a few. 

The title of the post is where I’ve felt the most conflicted. My friend passed 5 years ago today and my old acc has their messages on it. I got a notif from my old acc that I am not logged into about some mutual posting a picture. She immediately saw it and left my house (already about to leave anyways). And texts me about how I only have that acc to follow bitches. I had made a whole new acc just to have no one on it and so she knew I didn’t have anyone else. I thought this would be enough, but it wasn’t above and beyond as she needs to be shown and what she’s done for me. I should’ve unfollowed every girl I had on that acc previously but it didn’t cross my mind because I was never on it. 

This was the ultimate sign of disrespect atp in the relationship. She’s given me an ultimatum now if I don’t deactivate the account then we’re over. She’s suggested that if it was really the messages I was worried about then I’d just screen shot them to save. This just really irked me. I love this girl and I want her to be able to trust me again. Is this the way?

Edit: I wanted to add that at the beginning of the relationship I was completely in the wrong. I’d talk to people she didn’t like, I wouldn’t prioritize her, and do things to make her feel disrespected. It wasn’t my intent at all, but it came off that way. In my head I had my own way of balancing my personal relationships and my relationship. We’ve had history for years and we fell off for about a year. During this time I was confident that I learned from my mistakes and wanted to be a more open and friendly and open. I was carrying this sentiment early into the relationship I didn’t want to cut people off because of my relationship with her. I’d already done this and ended up isolated after we had stopped talking. I think this is why she feels so insecure in the relationship.

155,1cfrgfi,AITA for telling my best friends ex fling that she’s talking to his best friend?,"Throwaway. I (21f) and my bestfriend (22f) have been friends since our freshman year of highschool. I later made more friends that were added into our group. During our sophomore year, we met these 2 guys that went to a neighboring high school. They were both in the grade above us. She ended up talking to one of the guys (We’ll call him Johnathan) and I ended up talking to the other, Johnathan’s best friend, (we’ll call him Connor). Since they went to a different high school, and both mine and my best friends parents were strict, we were on and off talking to them.

 Although, throughout the years, Johnathan stayed in love with my best friend. She liked him back but not in the same way. Whenever we would get chances to hang out with them once in a blue moon, they would rekindle their little fling and as would Connor and I. Connor and I were never as serious as my friend and Johnathan. Johnathan ended up staying in our friend circle but Connor drifted off.

Fast forward to now, I go to college abroad and haven’t talked to Connor since high school, however, we somehow got in contact and started talking again. Talking about living together once i come back to the states. It was never that serious though.

I came to visit for spring break and saw him a few times and things were cutesy and flirty between us. However, once i left. They all had a big falling out with Johnathan. Apparently, he was shit talking everybody idk. I wasn’t there. I know i should take the side of my friends and cut Johnathan off, but my brain couldn’t really process everything i guess. Terrible excuse on my part. Connor ended up joining the friend group and distanced himself a bit from Johnathan too. 

Connor stopped talking to me and I noticed him and a few friends (including my best friend) were getting weirdly close, to the point i could tell something was going on. I’m a very understanding person and I would never intentionally put a man over my friends. If a friend wanted to talk to an ex fling, go for it. Just don’t hide it from me. Well, I found out that my best friend and Connor had started talking and sneaking around behind my back. Everybody in the circle knew, but nobody told me. Finally, she told me. I was hurt to say the least. Mainly because she kept it a secret from me for a couple weeks. I would have never done that to her. That’s girl code. I was pissed enough to text Johnathan and tell him everything.

156,1cfreu3,AITA FOR MOVING OUT OF MY BOYFRIENDS? (F18),"So to explain why I was living with him and his family in the first place was because I was kicked out of my parent's house. I was kicked out because I could not financially support my father's gambling addiction while still in my senior year of high school and he was emotionally abusive to me and i was exhausted and needed to get my things in order for college.

 Me and my boyfriend (M20) were not together at the time of my moving in; I was originally long-term best friends with his sister (F20) and she offered to let me stay while her mom was in jail. Eventually, my boyfriend and I got together and their mom got out of jail but she was okay with me staying as long as I contributed things like gas, groceries, essentials like laundry soap, did chores, etc.

 Flash forward to Easter I went and saw my parents to try and fix things because honestly I missed them despite what they have done to me. Turns out my father was getting help for his addiction and my mother started holding him accountable. They offered to have me move back in and said things would be different this time so I thought about it and had a discussion with my boyfriend's family a week later. Everyone seemed extremely supportive of me hashing things out with them and I told everyone I was going to start slow and spend a week with my family to see how it goes. 

Fast forward to a couple days after I move into my family's again--- It's going fantastic, Im getting to see my siblings again and it truly is different this time around. Then I get a SERIES of texts from all three of them. They are claiming I used them, left at a purposeful time (their mom is struggling with money), left as soon as my ebt card got refilled, did unfixable damage to my relationship, etc etc. 

The only thing I can think of for why they would be mad is the fact that their mom is struggling with a child support case, and she may have to get a job (she is on disability). Their bills are all behind but I feel that I have paid my dues tenfold and at the end of the day why should the stability of the house fall onto me? 

I have continuously given money into their family even when I was not living there, I babysat my friends child and her cousins kid for free all of the time, I fell behind in school because I couldn't get transportation to the bus stop, couldn't have a job because it was a waste of gas (even though i was putting 60 in gas a week), taking out of my college savings (about 2 grand total) to help out, and I was the only one who took care of the house on top of school while their mom was in jail. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; AITA for moving back into my parents instead of staying at my boyfriend's while their mom is struggling with bills. Despite helping out and not being able to get a job because of the situation. 

Am I the asshole for leaving or should I have stayed?

I was kicked out because I could not financially support my father's gambling addiction while still in my senior year of high school and he was emotionally abusive to me and i was exhausted and needed to get my things in order for college.

 Me and my boyfriend (M20) were not together at the time of my moving in; I was originally long-term best friends with his sister (F20) and she offered to let me stay while her mom was in jail. Eventually, my boyfriend and I got together and their mom got out of jail but she was okay with me staying as long as I contributed things like gas, groceries, essentials like laundry soap, did chores, etc.

 Flash forward to Easter I went and saw my parents to try and fix things because honestly I missed them despite what they have done to me. Turns out my father was getting help for his addiction and my mother started holding him accountable. They offered to have me move back in and said things would be different this time so I thought about it and had a discussion with my boyfriend's family a week later. Everyone seemed extremely supportive of me hashing things out with them and I told everyone I was going to start slow and spend a week with my family to see how it goes. 

Fast forward to a couple days after I move into my family's again--- It's going fantastic, Im getting to see my siblings again and it truly is different this time around. Then I get a SERIES of texts from all three of them. They are claiming I used them, left at a purposeful time (their mom is struggling with money), left as soon as my ebt card got refilled, did unfixable damage to my relationship, etc etc. 

The only thing I can think of for why they would be mad is the fact that their mom is struggling with a child support case, and she may have to get a job (she is on disability). Their bills are all behind but I feel that I have paid my dues tenfold and at the end of the day why should the stability of the house fall onto me? 

I have continuously given money into their family even when I was not living there, I babysat my friends child and her cousins kid for free all of the time, I fell behind in school because I couldn't get transportation to the bus stop, couldn't have a job because it was a waste of gas (even though i was putting 60 in gas a week), taking out of my college savings (about 2 grand total) to help out, and I was the only one who took care of the house on top of school while their mom was in jail. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; AITA for moving back into my parents instead of staying at my boyfriend's while their mom is struggling with bills. Despite helping out and not being able to get a job because of the situation. 

Am I the asshole for leaving or should I have stayed?

157,1cfralx,AITA for intervening when my female friend was getting harassed?,"
I (17M) am part of the theatre program at my high school. This year, a girl named Connie joined our group after transferring from another state. She quickly became friends with Henry, another friend of mine, and his girlfriend, as well as with others in our community. Connie is outgoing and kind-hearted, always trying to see the best in everyone, even those who aren't kind to her. While I don't know her extremely well, I consider us friends.

During the closing weekend of our last show, Connie started experiencing harassment from a guy in our group named Carson. Carson is known for his rude and aggressive behavior, which made Connie uncomfortable. Knowing this, Connie asked Henry and his girlfriend, as well as me and a couple of other friends, to keep an eye on Carson during the closing party at Henry's girlfriend's house.

Throughout the party, Carson persistently followed Connie, making her feel increasingly uneasy. At one point, he cornered her, causing her friend to alert Henry and me. Sensing trouble, we rushed to help while Connie's friend sought out her boyfriend, Gabe, for support. 

Upon entering the room, we found Carson yelling at Connie, who looked on the verge of tears. I attempted to calm the situation, but Carson grew more aggressive. Henry intervened by physically pushing Carson away from Connie, while I positioned myself between them to shield her. Henry's girlfriend comforted Connie, who was visibly distressed.

Fortunately, Gabe arrived shortly afterward, and Carson finally left, hurling insults at Connie on his way out. Understandably shaken, Connie and Gabe left the party early.

The next morning, my girlfriend expressed dismay over my actions, suggesting that I prioritized Connie over her and implying that I had overstepped boundaries by intervening physically. She refused to communicate further, leaving me feeling conflicted about whether my actions were justified.

Now, I'm left wondering if I should have intervened at all. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-29,"AITA for intervening when my female friend was getting harassed?

159,1cfr6t8,WIBTA if I moved out early?,"Hello, this is a sort of messy situation that's been picking at me for a while. My opinion keeps unbalancing, and I keep considering myself immature for what I think, so other opinions would be appreciated.

To start out, I (15f), have moved around a lot in my life. I have not gone to the same school for more than three years in a row, so I never really knew what it was like to know everyone in one place since childhood. My parents moved us in with our grandparents for a short amount of time while they found a home for us.
I settled in extremely well, for whatever cursed reason. I always had trouble fitting in just right, constantly feeling insecure, but I just seemed to click here. I found myself, and I found what I enjoyed. I was generally well-known, and I picked up several talents, skills, and made some memories and had new experiences that people my age don't come across too often (one of those was working a job. I was 14 at the time.) I think I enjoyed living there so much because I felt like I was being treated my age for once. My parents have always seemed to downplay me and discard my opinions and feelings simply because I'm younger. Yet I could feel my time there coming to an end. I knew we had a year, but the longer we spent there, the less willing I was to let go.
Towards the end of my time there, my aunt and uncle (I'd assume sensing how distraught I was), decided to ask my parents if there was any chance they could leave me with them for the remainer of my high school career. I could fly out to visit them with the money from my job. and I could continue to live my life without it being uprooted. I jumped on this right away, begging my parents to let me stay with them. My parents refused to budge, however. They never gave me a proper argument. We just moved away. They did promiss, however, that if I didn't enjoy it here for a year, they'd move me back.
Over this past year or so, I've felt my mental health slipping. Everytime I bring these concerns up to my parents, they insist they'll do something about it and then never do. After months of persisting, my parents grated me a visit, and I decided to take that. As expected, I didn't feel completely okay again. But I felt more supported than I had in months. It all felt normal and fresh, like I had never moved away. I realized the opportunities I had missed out on, where I could have gotten ahead of the curve.

160,1cfr44p,"AITA for leaving my ""best friend"" due to her insecurities?","(P.S: These are fake names)

Backstory: I met Mia in a couple of my classes during August and quickly became best friends. She was THE best friend but she also came with Lia. Lia was a gorgeous person who thought she was too ugly to be loved. But, I think her personal problems made her insecure. Also, Mia and Lia are the best friends who can't be separated cause of their 7 yr old friendship but they were acquaintances for most of it. (Became best friends this year AFTER I joined).

I started talking to both of them but I clicked more with Mia than Lia even though Lia and I have the exact same interests. I admit that I envied her at first but it's all love now. But, she didn't see that, instead I was the maniac that wanted to ruin everything. Her crush, friends, and prettiness. I would NEVER do that.

August - December was the best time but I did notice some toxic traits. I'm not complaining but Mia was always giving therapy to their older cousin (by 9 yrs!) through her phone. I could never have a convo w/ Mia without her phone. Lia always made sure to remind me that they both have been ""best"" friends for longer. I didn't notice it then tho, but now I do. Also, Lia also asked me for validation all the time through texts.

But, in December, I hit a really low mental state yet as usual Lia asked me for advice and care. It was draining. Once, she spammed me abt never finding love and stuff while I was having a panic attack. I shakily texted back saying ""hey I think I'm having a panic attack rn, ttyl?"". She texted ""lol, anyways..."". And then she continued. Turns out, she was also texting the exact same thing to Mia an hour ago and she was just copy pasting to WASTE MY TIME!!! (Mia showed me her texts).

So, during winter break, I did a digital detox (from them mainly). Never responded, and just took pictures on my trip tbh. BEST TIME EVER! They did question it tho but I said I was inactive everywhere  and told them before too.

Then, in January, everything went downhill. Lia called my mom a B\*\*\*\* out of nowhere. I tried resolving the issue but she kept it going. Insulting everything I'm insecure abt, always mentioning that I'm ""stealing"" Mia, never including me in plans, always interrupting me, and the list goes on. I texted her abt how she has been treating me (w/ proof). She responded with ""I'm sorry but I'm trying to get my crush back into my life..."" (exact words) and she said she would change but ofc she didn't.

Then it's v-day! Mia gets gifts for everyone except me. I was ok with this and gave my gifts to people who gave ME one. So she deleted our group insta, blocked me, and deleted our gc. I didn't notice till March when I asked her for a ""friendship break"".

Now, she is going around to people stating that I flirted w/ her crush. I didn't mind tho. Mia did follow Lia ""for their friendship"". People did come up to me w/ many stories from her. Idk anymore... AITA? Shd I still keep a friendship w/ them? I want the honeymoon phase back :(

I made it very clear to them, that if they wanted to add certain toppings, they could prep it and just add it to the pizza. I'll make and roll out the dough, and they can just add what they want. My siblings agreed but my dad didn't want to prep his onions, so he didn't which was fine for me. Just incase, I made the crust thin (he likes thin crust) and baked it when it was done.

I have two other brothers and he didn't ask those two for a cent. It's a long story with this particular brother, he does this type of thing all the time to me, he's very abusive towards me and for a long time I allowed it but I have made the decision to stand my ground.

164,1cfqb5d,AITA for wanting to get my own apartment?,"For context, I’m 19F, my boyfriend is 19M.

We have been dating for 3 years, and we live separately with each of our parents. I don’t have a good relationship with my mom, hence the reason for me wanting to move out of her house. I’ve spoken with one of my coworkers, and they currently live in a studio apartment, all bills paid, around $800 a month directly across from our place of work. I make around $2000 a month, so I feel like this would definitely be doable. I work fast food, so I usually eat at work. I make decent tips (lots of change) which would make it easy for me to pay to do my laundry with the tips I make. 

My boyfriend is completely against this. He says I’ll go bankrupt trying to pay for an apartment by myself, and that we were supposed to move in together. He wants me to move in with him and his mom instead. 

I’d rather not. I would like to have my own space, and live in my own space on my own terms. I feel that I’d feel more comfortable living by myself rather than my parent or his parent. 

He doesn’t want to move into an apartment with me, because he said he wants to save his money for a down payment on a house. He said the timeframe for him moving out of his mom’s would be when he’s about 25 or so, and when I brought that up to him when we were arguing about me moving into my own apartment, he said I need to ask his mom about moving in with them. 

Remember y’all, it’s all bills paid, 800 a month!! Directly across from my workplace!! I usually spend about 600 a month on Ubers to work and back, so I’d realistically have no other bills besides my phone bill and WiFi. I have a decent amount of money saved up too ($1500) which a portion could be used for the security deposit and application fee.

165,1cfq9ou,AITA for not getting rid of my cat?,"My 5yr old is allergic to cats, got him tested at like 2, and I think the allergy causes a consistent cough. Recently, like past Friday, he had a blood draw because his dad thought he might have lead poisoning (boy has been throwing up at school and complaining about feeling weak in the legs). We got the test results but no explanation on Friday evening. And it's a CBC, which isn't for lead testing. Ex/ kiddos dad immediately blames my cat for some the abnormal test results and says I need to get rid of her. I've had said cat for 10 yrs. It's death do us part. Kiddos dad starts saying I'm killing our son and he threatens to take full custody. Cause this is apparently the last straw.

But like AITA for refusing to get rid of or make my 10 yr old cat live outside??

edit, because more info: kiddo does have the cough outside of my house, at his dad's as well, who doesn't own any animals. kiddos paternal grandma does own several animals and kiddo stays at her house like 50% of the time, from what I hear.  apparently she does have a air purifier. 

I do clean my house regularly. and the cat isn't allowed in the bedrooms. cat is honestly avoidant of children, but I know how dander gets every where.

kiddo understands what he is allergic to, and I do give him medicine for the allergy. Kiddos cough isn't a coughing fit, it's like one or two coughs a couple times throughout the day. I have the special filters for my ac but not an air purifier.

167,1cfq22u,AITA for asking my husband to stop pointing out that I say a place name in an apparently silly way?,"I (31 female) have been watching a lot of hockey recently and since I cheer for the Oilers, have been talking a lot about the LA Kings since the Kings are our opponent in the first round of the playoffs. My husband (43 male) has pointed out intermittently over the years that I pronounce LA in a funny way - apparently when I say the city name it sounds like I’m saying ‘allay.’ I’ve been saying the name more recently because of watching the playoffs and almost every time I do, my husband smiles/smirks and then repeats the name back to me the way it’s apparently supposed to be said. 

I’ve explained to him that I cannot hear the difference between the way he says it and the way I do and though I try to play the whole thing off, it’s been starting to really get to me because it just makes me feel really self-conscious and like I’m going crazy trying to hear the difference between something I’m not able to. 

Tonight he did it again and I once again asked him to stop but he just said that it’s not a big deal and I really shouldn’t take it so seriously. And that if it bothers me so much that he corrects me, I should learn to hear the difference and say it properly. We sat apart for a bit after that because I had responded to him with some attitude and after a while I went downstairs to apologize to him for said attitude and once again ask him to just cool it with correcting me for a bit. The entire time I was talking to him, he was just sitting back in his desk chair and had a smirk on his face. I didn’t think he was taking me seriously and told him so, and he once again repeated that this just me saying something in a silly way and I shouldn’t take it so seriously. I said again that he’s hurting my feelings and asked that maybe he could just learn to live with me saying it a little funny but he responded by saying that now I’m the one asking him to have to listen to my funny pronunciation forever and that I’m “setting him up for failure” because he wouldn’t be able to keep a straight face or stop himself from pointing it out. I finally started crying and it was only then that he apologized for hurting my feelings and I responded that I don’t believe he’s actually sorry and that the only reason he said that was because I started crying.

I (31M) am getting married in 5 months. My sister Jenna (26F) has been dating her girlfriend Lucy for about six months now. Jenna lives 3 hours away in another city and is bi, a fact that our family isn't aware of, except for my siblings and me. We've met Lucy a few times, but she hasn't met the rest of the family due to her FIFO work schedule.  
Jenna wants to bring Lucy to the wedding, but so far, Lucy hasn't been able to attend any family gatherings. Our parents' 30th wedding anniversary is next month, but Lucy can't make it due to work, and Jenna feels a cousin's baby shower isn't the right place to introduce her partner. I've told Jenna that Lucy won't be invited to the wedding unless she comes to a family event first or at least shows a photo of them together at such an event.  
Jenna argues that our wedding is the only time Lucy will be free to meet everyone and that it would be a perfect opportunity. However, I believe that the wedding day should be about celebration without the awkwardness of first-time introductions. This stance has led my siblings to accuse me of being homophobic and some are threatening to not attend the wedding if Lucy isn't invited.
