0,1cfpr1q,AITA for not congratulating my best friend on her pregnancy ,"A little back story, I go to college 7 hours away from my family and high school friends. The fall of 2023 was my freshman year. However, I had to withdraw from college in February because of medical issues. I leave to go back to college in 2 weeks.

My best friend and I have been friends for 8 years, since 6th grade. Now, our friendship wasn't perfect it had been on and off since freshman year. Since graduating we have gotten closer and our friendship had been better than ever. My boyfriend came to stay with me over spring break and I had asked her if he could spend some of the nights at her house as she had a spare room and a queen-sized mattress. I only had a twin-sized mattress and I had to make my boyfriend sleep on the couch. She said that he could stay the whole week if he wanted to. 

Around this same time, she stopped her birth control and I asked her if she was going to use condoms and she said no that she and her boyfriend wanted a baby. They are nowhere near ready to have a baby. They just got a puppy and they live in an apartment they can barely afford. It wasn't a stretch to say I thought a baby right now was a bad idea, but I bit my tongue and said I was happy for her. She was super excited and said that I would be one of the first people to know right after her family. After my boyfriend left she ghosted me. We kept our Snapchat streak but every time I asked her to hang out she came up with some excuse. 

Fast forward a month, she posted all over social media that she was pregnant and she had not told me at all. A few minutes after she responded to my snap from earlier in the day, I opened it and didn't respond as I normally would. A few days later she sent me a text message saying that it was good being my friend but goodbye. I asked her what I did and she said that she was upset that I didn't congratulate her on her pregnancy. I explained that I was hurt that she didn't personally tell me about it. She said that it was because I said that she didn't need a baby because now she had a puppy. In all honesty, I don't remember saying that but I could've said it. We talked it through and worked it out. I asked her when she could hang out as I go back to college in 2 weeks and I don't know when I will be back. 

She once again ghosted me so I reached back out to her and asked why she was doing this. She made a bunch of excuses and I called her out on it. The biggest excuse was her pregnancy and I asked how her being pregnant prevented her from texting me back. This turned into a fight and she ended up saying that I would be happy if she had a miscarriage. I have no idea where she got this idea from. I don't agree with terminating a pregnancy just because. I told her to quit lying to herself and I hope that she and the baby are healthy. I have also removed her from every social media.

1,1cfpkg4,AITA for not letting a family member move in,"Backstory, I previously lived with my husbands parents/family when we were younger (early twenties). During this time his sister and brother also lived there. My husbands sister was a complete slob, would damage things from her anger issues and overall showed no accountability for any of her actions. She made it a very hostile environment for everyone and if she did not have her way she was making it known to everyone by screaming, throwing things, and damaging the property. Overall not a great person to be around or live with.

Now, she is going through a divorce because of her cheating on her husband and is looking for somewhere new to live. She has brought up that she would like to move into our house to my husbands parents without asking me or my husband about it. I know that the conversation will come up soon because we have plans to grab lunch later this week. 

I do not feel comfortable with her living with us, she has been sleeping around, is still a slob and our morals and values do not line up whatsoever. My husband also has said he does not want to deal with her nor does he want to support her. Her parents also do not want her to move back in but I am starting to feel guilty about not helping her through a hard time.

2,1cfpg0o,AITA for talking shit about my roommates to my partner?,"I (21F) and my partner (23M) are living with another couple (22F and 25M), Sarah and James. We live with them because it's a good way to save money until I finish school in May and start my new job. Sarah is a student and James is a janitor and doesn't make very much. Financially, this was a good decision. Sarah is the most negative person I've ever met. She is constantly talking shit about James to me and tries to get my partner and I to agree then talk bad about each other. Sarah also talks bad about everyone she knows, including my friends and mutaul friends between the rest of us, and I have heard her talk shit about me a few times but I turned on my TV so she knew I was home. Everyone who knows her warns me she is a narcissist and to be careful around her. My coworker is friends with her dad and says that she is bad news. We've been living with them for about a year and our lease ends in about a month. 5 weeks ago I decided I wouldn't talk to Sarah unless she spoke to me first because she was always so negative. We've talked once in the last 5 weeks because James talked to me first and she was there.

This past weekend I had enough and told my partner while in our bedroom that I couldn't handle how rude Sarah was anymore and he suggested I just keep being nice, be the bigger person because we will be living somewhere else soon anyways. I was upset and in that moment felt like he took her side. I went off about what a terrible person she is and how I hate living with them and called her every name under the sun. Yes, even that one. He finally got me to calm down after we argued about a few things for 30ish minutes.

James texted my partner and said he heard a lot of what was said and that he was sorry we felt that way and that he didnt realize we hated both of them but that he can't hang out with someone who doesn't like him. James and my partner have been friends for a very long time and I feel as if I ruined their friendship. My partner responded to James letting him know that there is no issue with him on his end and that he sees James as one of his really good friends. James left him on read. I texted James letting him know I never said anything about him and I think he's a good guy. He ignored me too.

Everything I said about Sarah, as rude as it was, is how I feel. My partner did nothing wrong. He even stood up for James and Sarah when I went too far but they don't care to hear it.

So, for context, this friend and I had lost contact over the summer as they didn't have a phone at the time, and we live far away from each other. We reconnectted this past September and messaged semi-frequently for months afterwards. Around the beginning of this time and during our conversations, I mentioned my dislike of texting/calling and how I prefer to speak in person.

Now, this person later became more clingy and physically affectionate in person and it bled into their texts. (Their nickname for me for the longest time was 'Cutie'). And I began to get uncomfortable and didn't speak up.

I soon began to stop messaging back, ignoring them until later hours until I merely left them on read every so often. This turned into infrequent messages. And then I would only text when out or on long car rides. And they would complain. And I would apologize, explain I spent my time with my family. My time on social media was limited, etc. etc.

Around the beginning of this month, April, around the 7th? They began to ignore me. They brushed me off and only spoke to me while in group conversations.

I am a part time singer-songwriter and i have a lot of songs that mention this ex by name that i still perform to this day(theyre very meaningful to me), and i haven’t asked my girlfriend how she feels about it but she’s been to the shows and im pretty sure she’s fine with it. 

anyways, after i told her i would be in town my ex invited me to her birthday party(which i was really excited about). It was a dinner with her and her family at a restaurant and i told her that my girlfriend and i would stop by. my girlfriend seemed a little confused when we got there, as she assumed that this was a party and not an intimate dinner, but she got along well with my ex and her family. she and my ex even wore the same color shirt, which i thought was really funny and i took a picture of them together to remember the whole thing.

while we were driving back, my gf seemed a little off and i asked her what was wrong. she said that it was weird that i wanted to go to this party, and it was even weirder for her to meet the girl that all of my songs are about. she said that i put her in an uncomfortable situation and didn’t really give her a choice in going to this thing and that she came to my hometown to meet MY family, not my ex’s. i thought the dinner went really well and she seemed to be getting along with my ex just fine. i think she’s overreacting and is coming off as jealous. am i missing something here?

5,1cfp3b0,AITA for selling an item instead of giving it to my sibling?,"Several years ago my mother was getting rid of a really nice motorized garden tool that she had for years and had used a lot but no longer needed. She asked if I wanted it. I was living in the country and had a large garden and it would be really useful so if course I accepted it. About a year later, my mother passed away suddenly and we were left to deal with her large estate. All the siblings amicably split up all the belongings we wanted to keep and the rest was donated. About 6 months later, I found myself in the middle of a long, nasty divorce and caring for my 4 children on my own. Money was tight and I had moved from my 20 acre property (in preparation for it to be sold and split by me and my ex) and moved into a small rental in town. I no longer had a need for the gardening tool and I really didn't have room for it. On top of that, I really needed money and this tool could be sold for around $1k. When my sister found out I planned to sell the item, she was shocked and said that she and her kids had a lot of good memories with our mom using that tool and she didn't want to see it sold. She asked if she could have it. I told her I needed the money and offered to sell it to her. She refused and became angry. She accused me of being insensitive and only caring about money. I reminded her that I was trying to support 4 children - on my own - with no help from my STBX and I needed every penny I could get my hands on. I also reminded her that this had been given TO ME - from our mom - years ago, because she no longer needed or wanted it. Obviously this item did not hold sentimental value to our mother.

And how could I possibly do this when our mother had passed away. I, again, explained my side and said that if it was that important to her I would happy to sell it to her but she refused. 

(Please know that financially she was more than capable of buying the item. Money was not an issue for her. I know for a fact she had more than $20k in savings at this time.)

7,1cfoega,AITAH for not wanting my boyfriend to hang out or talk with one of his childhood female friends who he had also dated in the past?,"So my boyfriend (19m) of 4 years off and on and me (f18) have been together for 1 full year and 2 months. Before we were off and on all of high school. The first time freshman year we got together he broke up with me too fool around with another girl (who was ""just a friend""), then got back together with me before telling me about the other girl which you probably know how that ended. A year (sophomore year)after that we got back together I ended up helping him cheat on his (at the time) current girlfriend without knowing it and found out about it afterwards. And then senior year we got back together and things were a lot different. He changed a lot got more mature and stopped fooling around with other people. 

We were dating for about 4 months and I ended up getting kicked out of my parents house because of school and went and lived with him and his sister. I had trust issues in the beginning because of the past and slowly we built that trust and now I trust him 99%. We ended up getting our own place and we have a great relationship. He recently brought up how he started talking to his childhood bestfriend who I will call Hannah. 

He had told me about Hannah before hand how they dated when they were younger but it didn't last very long. And the reason I'm very hesitant on this is because last time he talked to her I was on the phone with him back when we first got together senior year; and he completely ignored me and kept talking to her. And our friends don't like her either. I told him I didn't like the fact that he was talking to her and really didn't want him to. He swore up and down that he doesn't like her. So I hesitantly agreed and told him there will be boundries. She's not allowed at our house, he is not allowed to hang out with her alone or without me.

 I sometimes will check their messages just to make sure. He agreed with me and I really do appreciate it but I feel like l'm being toxic and unnecessary. Sometimes there is a small part of me that worries. I do trust him. And sometimes I get iffy when it comes to other girls around him but I try not to go overboard because I love him i our relationship.

We were dating for about 4 months and I ended up getting kicked out of my parents house because of school and went and lived with him and his sister. I had trust issues in the beginning because of the past and slowly we built that trust and now I trust him 99%. We ended up getting our own place and we have a great relationship. He recently brought up how he started talking to his childhood bestfriend who I will call Hannah. 

He had told me about Hannah before hand how they dated when they were younger but it didn't last very long. And the reason I'm very hesitant on this is because last time he talked to her I was on the phone with him back when we first got together senior year; and he completely ignored me and kept talking to her. And our friends don't like her either. I told him I didn't like the fact that he was talking to her and really didn't want him to. He swore up and down that he doesn't like her. So I hesitantly agreed and told him there will be boundries. She's not allowed at our house, he is not allowed to hang out with her alone or without me.

 I sometimes will check their messages just to make sure. He agreed with me and I really do appreciate it but I feel like l'm being toxic and unnecessary. Sometimes there is a small part of me that worries. I do trust him. And sometimes I get iffy when it comes to other girls around him but I try not to go overboard because I love him i our relationship.

8,1cfo5aa,AITA for giving away my dad and my sister's tickets to my graduation ceremony and telling them to not bother showing up,"I (18F) have my high school graduation ceremony this Wednesday. It was sent to my parents in an email that I will be giving a speech that day as my grades made me valedictorian of my school's class of 2024, and I was excited to do so. My school made us reserve and buy tickets to the ceremony weeks in advance, and I picked mine up on the 26th. 

The problem started at dinner when I told my family I picked up the tickets for my graduation day and would keep them with me until the day of just to make sure they don't get lost. My dad told me that he and my sister had plans for an hour before the ceremony, but that my mom would be there the whole time, and that they'd try to be there for the afterparty. I was honestly shocked for a moment, before starting to laugh, assuming they weren't serious. 

When I realized they actually weren't joking, I'll admit I was a bit mad. I'm usually a very shy and non-confrontational person, even around my family, but I started yelling at my dad and sister, asking if they were seriously ditching my graduation ceremony. I told them that the afterparty was useless to attend, and that all the pictures of the graduates with their families would be taken at least 2 hours before the ceremony. They said it's fine and we can take our own pictures the day after my graduation, but I got up and left dinner. 

Over the weekend, I saw a few people on my class group chat complain that they didn't get enough tickets, so I offered up the two tickets I had, and met up with a girl from my class to give them to her, and even though I told her not to, she actually paid me the original price for them. 

When the topic of graduation was brought up by my dad today during lunch, I told him that I gave the other two tickets away and only my mom will be attending, so they shouldn't bother with the afterparty. He got mad and asked why I would do that, to which I replied that I don't see the point in wasting money on tickets if they're not going to use them. My dad blew up on me, saying I'm acting like a spoiled brat, and it's not like I'll die if he and my sister are a bit late to my graduation. 

I spoke to a few people about it, my friends and my grandma. My friends said good riddance and if they consider their plans more important, they can have fun. But my grandma said that while she understands my side, I shouldn't have given away the tickets just to spite my dad, because maybe he would have changed his mind and gone on time. So I'm looking for a non-biased opinion. AITA?

11,1cfn5gh,AITA for playing a powerful MTG commander deck?,"So this is kindof a nerd question. I'll give some pre-amble for those who don't play Magic the Gathering. MTG is a game that has historically been played in a 1-v-1 format, but there is a specific format called commander which features multiplayer pods as well as a wide range of potential power levels decks can operate in. Commander players have a reputation for being a bit on the casual (less competitive) side. Tournaments are a thing but commander is also viable for friday night game night with the boys.

  
My friends and I have recently gotten into commander. I built my first deck with my brother's help, who is a very experienced magic player. Basically the deck works by chaining together extra turns. Totally legal, but maybe not much fun to play against. This deck proceeded to stomp the pod without much competition. My friends convinced me to nerf the deck, which I wasn't too thrilled about but I did it. Even after I nerfed my deck they would sort of grumble and groan whenever I pulled it out. Sorry, it's what I got!

After seeing their reaction I decided to build another deck on my own without my brother's help so my friends couldn't complain that I had an unfair advantage by getting help from a magic veteran. This second deck doesn't chain together extra turns but is powerful for different reasons. My friends still complain about how unfun it is to play against. Today I took the deck to game night at my LGS to see how it might be received in a different meta and I noticed my pod yawning and playing on their phones whenever I took my turn. To be fair, turns with this deck can take a minute, but I go as fast as I can. I have exactly one friend who seems to enjoy the challenge because he plays an equally powerful deck of his own making.

As far as I've seen, nobody in the magic community can seem to agree on what strategies are ""broken"" or ""unfair"" vs. what strategies are ""appropiately powerful"". Personally, I think that distinction is arbitrary and stupid. I think people should play whatever they want within the legal rules of the game, especially in a multiplayer format where power-levels can balance out by teaming up on the most powerful player.

  
I don't know what to do. I want to play to win, but I want to win in such a way that my friends want to keep playing with me. I've already dropped about $600 dollars on magic cards so I'm not to hip to the idea of building an entirely new (deliberately weaker) deck just to make my friends happy.

* He is (in my opinion) emotionally abusive to my girlfriend's sister.
* He disrespected me for no good reason in front of my girlfriend's family. Specifically, I asked the waiter if we could add a chair to our table at a restaurant so that he could join us - he then mocked/mimicked me...
* They very recently broke up (for the 3rd or 4th time), and are now back together + expecting everyone to act as though this didn't happen.
* My girlfriend and her entire family do not like him.

To clarify, I have never treated him badly, and accept that I will have to see and interact with him at other family events - I simply do not want him in my home.

Since the age of 12, my daughter would inquire about things to study and I would teach her different concepts in mathematics and physics and also programming. These days she self studies also. These are typically topics that are more advanced than what she learns at school and as a side effect it has made the school science and math seem trivial for her.

I recently a small assignment for her based on some 3D visualization tool where she can see a simulation and program the controller in C++ using a tool called Robot Operating System. I had her implement a [bang bang controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control) and [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller). Initially to learn on a simulated fan but then to drive a simulated car in a game like environment using simulated LIDAR sensors for the PID control.

While doing so and taking to her about the bang bang controller for driving based on collision detection, I made a joke about the bang bang controlled driving being like her mom's driving. My wife overheard us and got upset at me and called me a jerk. She had just scratched her car by backing into a low concrete ledge the other day and has scraped her car a couple of times before (maybe like 5 or 6). It was just a light hearted joke and I don't think she is a bad driver or anything just had some bad luck. 

She gave me a lecture and took it way too deep saying I am training our daughter to be sexist (which is ridiculous since she is a woman too) and that she will lose respect for her mom or myself.

My niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class. 

She has a high backed booster seat in my car. She's never cared until a couple days ago. I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out. 

I explained the booster seat to the nanny and she told me that the other girl also has a booster seat, just a backless one. I thought about it but I'm really not comfortable with my niece being in a backless booster. She barely meets the weight requirement for a booster seat and we've already had so many health issues since she's moved in with me that I need her to be as safe as possible right now.

I took her with me to get her booster seat and to drop it off with her babysitter and when she saw that we were getting a high back seat, she lost it. She said all of the other kids are going to be mean to her and I'm treating her like a baby and she doesn't want a babysitter if she needs a booster seat. 

I tried reassuring her that nobody in her class is going to know, except for the other girl the babysitter will be watching (and I've volunteered in this class enough to know that this girl is the sweetest thing and won't say anything). Still nothing I say is making her feel better and she's threatening to refuse to get in the car with the babysitter tomorrow. ",No A-holes here,2024-04-29,"AITA for forcing my niece to use a booster seat? I have been my 12 year old niece's legal guardian for a couple months. 

My niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class. 

She has a high backed booster seat in my car. She's never cared until a couple days ago. I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out. 

I explained the booster seat to the nanny and she told me that the other girl also has a booster seat, just a backless one.

16,1cflrk7,WIBTA for not inviting my ADHD cousin to my graduation?,"I, f18, have an annoying, entitled younger cousin, m12, we'll call Darwin (not his real name). Darwin and his sister's mom died 3 years ago, and they've had everything handed to them since. 

I live with my grandparents because both of my parents live 30 minutes out from the school I've attended since freshman year, my dad moving away end of junior year. Since I'm autistic and resistant to change, my grandparents let me stay with them. My grandparents also let my cousins stay with them as opposed to living with their dad. 

Darwin has always been a pain in the ass. He has ADHD, and in the beginning, I got it. But now he uses his ADHD as an excuse for every shitty behavior. Disrespects his grandparents? ADHD. Breaks expensive stuff? ADHD. Ordering stuff he knows isn't a safe food, hence wasting $12+ every time we go out? ADHD. My grandpa tries to be a disciplinarian, but my grandmother cuddles him. It's gotten to a point where me, my grandpa, and his sister refuse to go on trips if he's going. The trip we took this past March told us everything we need to know. As soon as I vote in the next election (the polling location is right down the street from here), I'm moving in with my dad and his gf, as moms house is already packed. 

However, there's one key thing coming up: my graduation. I seriously don't want him or his sister there. However, his sister has agreed not to be glued to her phone while I graduate already. Darwin, however cannot sit still, shut up, or behave. It's not even ""typical ADHD behavior"". It's just him simply misbehaving. I've already told my grandmother but she's just brushing me off.

My friend, let's call her Sara (26f), has recently decided to complain that ""I'm not attentive enough to her these past few months.""  I tried to gently tell her that while I love her a lot, and care for her, and do want to hear any complaint or difficulty she has in her life - I obviously am not as attentive as I once was (we have known each other for 10+ years too), and I need her patience since I'm going thru a lot. Her reply was that she thinks ""I can't see anyone else's pain anymore and think my pain cancels everyone else's."" 

I will add that Sara's recent ""pain"" has been around being super busy with her upcoming wedding (which she declined any help from me at preping) and job, and admittedly some past trauma she was reminded of - but I DO listen when that comes up to my best ability.

Long story short, I got mad and told Sara that while I get that you can be sad or mad or tired while having a decent life, rn she DOES have it way easier and can cut me some slack and lower expectations for a bit, and she is acting completely entitled unlike what I expect of her as someone who actually did have some hardship in life (in which I was there to support her.)

19,1cflkd9,AITA for not wanting to slow down my edible usage for my partner?,"I (F25) have been dating my boyfriend (M24) for a little over a year. We’ve got plans to move in together within the next month. I love him very much and want to make this work.

I’ve been a regular edible taker for about 3 years now. I started to help fall asleep during college. Now I’m graduated for a few years, so I usually just take my edible after I get home for the day to chill, unwind, and still help me fall asleep. During the day, I have a great job, I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, financially independent, involved in the community, etc. So not the type to wake up and immediately hit a bong.

My boyfriend was raised in a home where weed is the devil. His father’s side has also dealt with alcoholism and it tore the family apart. A few reasons for not liking edibles is health concerns and feeling isolated when I get high, as sometimes I go a little mute. I told him I’d make more of an effort to be talkative if that’s how he feels. He also doesn’t think getting high every day is a good way to live life (seems to be the core issue here), but my thought is, if I have my shit together life-wise and I only get high at night, does it really matter?

He makes some valid points and I want to respect his wishes, but on the other hand, I don’t feel like I should have to stop to appease him, especially when it seems like the biggest reason he doesn’t like it is because of his family. I empathize his family doesn’t like weed and that addiction has caused many issues for them, but that doesn’t have anything to do with me.

Some context I am a (26)Male. I work really hard to make ends meet and take care of myself and family. I live with family and pay a good portion of rent. I also tend to alot of different family members needs on a pretty consistent basis, leaving me with not alot of time to myself. I do like to joke around from time to time with all of the people in my life, but nearly most of them seem to take things too far. I get called little annoying nicknames like gayboy, smelly, and alot more honestly. Some things my family does too is consistently cut me off when I'm talking about something important, and then get mad when I tell then to stop and that it's rude. 

An Example: Me and my mom are at the dinner table talking about musical artist and how we feel about some of them. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like a good chat about the music industry. She says what she wants to say, then I start talking. As I do she gets on her phone then ignores me as I'm talking. Watching a tiktok video out loud. I recognize this and stop mid sentence, kind of disappointed. She then says something about how I look like the guy in the video. I then ask her if she was even listening to me. She then gets mad and says that I'm being rude for pointing out her own rudeness. I then get yelled at and berated because I just wanted to talk and enjoy a conversation with my mom. 

Another problem I have alot is when people touch me. I do NOT like being touched. It is something I've made a point to many people. Yet many of them still touch me. For instance family members will touch me even with out asking me, and it will scare the shit out of me. I will tell them to stop and that if they want a hug, hand shake or anything to tell me before they freaking just touch me. And they'll argue, ""your my son! What I can't hug you? That's shitty of you."" Or ""bro rude, we're family, I'm not gonna hurt you!"" Or even ""wow, you must think your so special then!"" 
All it is, is a preference, and something that startles me. I don't have alot of trust in alot of people and I've been hurt by people I even thought I loved. I just want boundaries.
