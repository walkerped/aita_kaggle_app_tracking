Within know us for a few minutes it's really easy to tell us apart and is really no issue. We both had a friend who I will call T. T is non-binary and wanted to go by the name they felt comfortable with. All of our friends were super cool with that and very supportive about it. Well one day T decide it would be funny to only call me by my twins name. It was funny the first few times but quickly got old, so I told them to stop. They didn't. For the entire time they would not stop calling me by my twins name. So they asked me for something ""hey (insert twins name) can you hand me something"" I responded yea followed by their dead name. They go really quite and told me to never call them that. Simply responded by telling them to never call me by my twins name. Later that day I sent an apology, and to this day I still feel really bad about, but I tried to explain to them that it also made me upset when I was called by a name I wasn't comfortable with.

1,1ch2v7f,AITA for rejecting my trans (ex) friend?,"This story is almost a year old, but imma tell it anyway. 

I, (19M) knew a friend in high school (19 FTM) who liked before he came out as trans. When he still identified as a girl, he rejected me and kinda ghosted me for 2 years. This was sophomore year, back when Covid was rampant and people were in quarantine. 

Fast forward to my senior year, literally the last day, I’m getting teachers to sign my yearbook, and he asks me to sign his. I sign his in return, and I basically wrote a big apology for two years ago bc of how I didn’t talk to him (secretly, I thought I was the reason he became trans).

After that day, we started talking again over the phone, just casually and catching up basically. We talked about college plans, memes, how we’re doing in our own friend groups. 

Not even 2 weeks pass before my other friend just hits me with a, “You know he has a crush on you, right?”

This is because they were talking and my trans friend told my other friend about his feelings for me.

I hoped that my friend would just let these feelings wash over and pass on, but he then confessed over text. 

At first, I easily smoothed things over, but my big mouth just had to ask why he even had feelings, and when I got the “I don’t know” text, I was just stricken. Not the “mad” kind, but “disappointed.” 

To sum it up, I basically said “I wish you had these feelings when you still identified as a girl” and that “I had feelings for (deadname), not (current name)”, basically invalidating him. 

We stopped talking after that, even when I apologized for my actions. He didn’t want to be friends anymore, and I accepted that.

FF again to December 2023, and I decide to send one last apology to him, mainly because I felt guilty for the last 6 months and wanted to take accountability, to which he rejected with anger. I didn’t argue with him and left it with a final goodbye.

This isn’t something I linger over, but I have to ask, AITA?

2,1cgw02s,AITA for not apologizing for making fun of my brothers chest? ,"Well. I can’t believe I’m asking strangers on the internet this, but I feel like I’m going nuts. 



I(25F) am not a small woman. Or at least my thighs and butt aren’t. Everything else? Very slight. I’ve had two separate women try to give me the nickname ‘baby tits’. One VERY ex boyfriend told me that I was ‘lucky he had an avocado fetish’. It’s just the way I am, whether I’m actively playing sports or shut up indoors in winter, I am, to quote shitty fashion magazines, a pear. 



Which doesn’t bother me, I think I look fine, but for some reason invites the fucking opinions of everyone else. Especially my little brother. 



For the last eleven years he (24M) has been taking every shot he can at me. From the most juvenile ‘what’s up? Besides your butt’ to playing that one line from the heathers musical soundtrack whenever I walked into the room, he’s been making fun of my butt for over a decade. Everytime I tried yo get our parents to make him stop I would get scolded for not being more mature, for ‘letting him’ hurt my feelings, for not just ignoring him, etc etc.



Here’s the thing. My brother is a trans man. Female to male. Which is great! He’s much happier as ‘Alex’ than he was as \*redacted\*. I’m very happy for him. 



Now. Because god thinks he’s fucking funny Where as all of my fat gathered squarely in my butt and thighs, he got incredibly big breasts. Even if he hadn’t started transitioning, he would have had to get reduction surgery for the sake of his back. 



I was in town visiting our parents a couple weeks ago and his fiancé was there. The three of us were in the kitchen and wouldn’t you know it, but he called me ‘big booty Judy’ right in front of his fiancé. 



I finally snapped and said, ‘oh yeah, too bad I couldn’t have boobs half as big as my baby brothers.’ 



He shut up and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. 



My mom was furious for risking triggering his dysphoria and for making fun of him in front of his girlfriend. She tried to get me to write him a letter apologizing and I refused. Now every conversation I have with her somehow turns into her trying to weasel a promise out of my that I’ll never say it again and that I’ll say I’m sorry. 



Funny enough, my brother hasn’t said shit about my butt since then.

So I'm a 30 year old trans woman. I'm three years into my transition. My friends have all been supportive, my work has been supportive, and my mother is doing her best to learn. The people who seem to be having issues are my dad and brother.

So as part of my transition, I've been growing my hair out and it's gotten quite long. I'm still getting used to things like straightening it and getting rid of knots, but I'm trying my best.

5,1cgjbiv,AITA for saying my boyfriend is trying too hard to be like his best friend,"So me and my bf met in university and we’ve been dating for a few months now. Ever since, I’ve known he was super close with his one best friend since childhood (lets call him Mike), and originally, to me, they just looked like a bunch of best friends that liked doing everything together.

When I started to get closer to Mike and his girlfriend, I started to notice some… odd things, I guess. Like how Sam originally wanted to go to another uni but changed his mind to come to this one because Mike was here, started attending piano lessons because Mike was doing it, etc. 

He even started “picking up” on Mike’s interests, for example, at first, I was a mild anime fan and he would kind of make fun of me for it, but the moment Mike started watching it, my bf had put anime posters in his room and told me he was into it now. When we go shopping, he would buy stuff that I know for a FACT Mike has, but then when they would “coincidentally” run into each other wearing the same stuff, my boyfriend would act all surprised and be like “I didn’t know you had that” when he clearly did. He would also always play music that Mike recommended to him and said that he didn’t need to make Spotify playlists because he would just listen to Mike’s or whatever. 

I also found out that Mike had started dating his gf like, a month before my bf started dating me, and I think we’ve gone on more “double dates” with them than actual dates on our own. Or we would go somewhere and “coincidentally” Mike and his gf would be there. 

Anyway Mike’s gf also noticed the same thing when I was talking to her, but she says Mike doesn’t notice anything out of the ordinary and that he is used to my bf acting this way. However the final straw for me was when Mike said he planned to go to Mexico over Summer break with his gf, and now my bf is trying to convince me to go to Mexico so we can have a couples retreat or whatever with Mike and his gf. I told him to stop trying to be Mike so hard, and my bf got super angry and said I was being delusional.

Middle was full, left lane has the pump on the right (my trucks gas cap is on the left) so I pulled to the far right one. There was another truck not fully pulled up so i had to go around and reverse into said pump. I attempted to reverse but my truck was too big and the person behind me was too close. Once i realized it was best to not attempt to inch as close as possible to the guy behind me (my truck has a hitch with a cooler on it, adds about 2 feet) I simply drove forward and around to the far left lane.

 I rolled my window down and heard a guy yelling. To my surprise, the gas attendant was yelling at me to leave. I thought he was just trying to be funny so i smiled and said whats the problem? At this point a random woman came and started holding this guy back! I said seriously what’s going on? He said “you whip around this place like that? I’m a human being! You’re not getting gas here! You can take it up with my manager tomorrow!” 

I shook my head and left because the guy clearly has a few screws loose but looking back I’m genuinely curious if I did something wrong. Note I did not exceed 5mph to go around to the new pump it’s a very tight area. Curious to hear your guys’ thoughts. ",,0.9798345,1,0
10,1cgionx,AITA for not giving away my shirt to my uncle?,"Honestly, I think this is extremely stupid, but here goes. Also, English isn't my native language, and I am typing from the phone.

I (23F) and my mother have a close relationship, but with rough edges, like anyone else.  As is normal where we live, we generally give things that we do not use or need to other family members who need them, and unfortunately it is very common to force children to give their toys to cousins ​​or siblings younger than them.  She and I have fought a lot about it in the past, and it's gotten a lot better, but recently another issue of that nature came up.

 My boyfriend has (or well, had, because I wear it) a fairly thick dress shirt with a very nice print, it is really of very good quality, but unfortunately it is at least three or four sizes larger than it should be ( long story as to how he got it, is irrelevant), and logically he never uses it, because it looks like a waste.  Since he doesn't use it, he gave it to me so I could wear it as pajamas, and I honestly adore it.  It's like a huge warm and soft nightgown.

 A few days ago, my mother saw the shirt and commented (somewhat insistently) that it would be good for me to give it to my uncle F, because it is his size, and it would fit him very well, since it is practically a high quality shirt. new.  I, who have some problems saying no, told her I would think about it and thought she would forget about it, until yesterday, when we went to visit some relatives and she saw the shirt again (I took it with me in my pajamas, because we spent the night there), and he offered it and practically gave it directly to my uncle who was there, and even showed it to him so he could measure it.  Unfortunately, it was her exact size, and she quite liked the print and fabric.

 Then I spoke privately with her, told her directly that I would not give away my pajamas, and that she had no right to offer or give away my things, no exceptions.  She understood, but she said she wasn't giving away my things.  We didn't argue, but it was pretty awkward, and we basically agreed to disagree.

11,1cgimqt,AITA for paying for my (33F) husband's birthday (36M)?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years, together for 7. He has struggled with his birthday the entire time I've known him, although he's never able to articulate why. The only reason he has ever really given is that they make him feel unloved. He doesn't know where this stems from.

As a result, I made it a mission to make all of his birthdays special. I wanted him to always feel loved, and while I have definitely gone a little over the top on occasion, they're usually well with the range of a normal birthday (gifts, decorations, cake, and taking him out somewhere). He hates when I spend money on him, but he can't articulate why that is, either. We both work.

This year, we're doing the usual gifts & cake, but he asked if we and some friends of ours could go golf together. I checked with our friends and they're free, so I was going to book tee times. When my husband found out I intended to pay for our friends, though,  he came unraveled.

It became a fight. He doesn't want me to pay for their fee and was extremely emotional about it. I strongly feel like I should pay for them. They can definitely afford it, but as the inviter I feel like it's only appropriate to cover their fee. Also, I already told them I was paying when I invited them and to top it off, the additional fee to cover them is only $50. I kept trying to reason with him (I'm his wife, I l WANT to do nice things for him, it's his birthday, etc.) but he just got increasingly more upset that I wasn't listening to him. I tried to ask to talk about it tomorrow but he said he didn't want to talk about it.

It's not a finance issue. We aren't rich but we are comfortable and the money being spent is my ""play"" money. He said I've stressed him out so much that he doesn't even want to go and, well, ditto. It's draining to try so hard every year only to be met with a ""meh"" at best, but not trying would make him feel unloved so that's not an option.

I eventually gave up and told him we would do whatever he wanted but, honestly, I'm not happy with his reaction.

So there’s this workout bench that has adjustable height. I wanted to use it to work my lower abs. So I went to ask my brother could I use it. He asked why and already that was a stupid question. It’s a workout bench do you need anymore answers? I told him I needed it and then he told me no because he’s using it. Mind you this dude is always on his phone 24/7. If he did use it it was prolly for like a good 10 minutes because that’s prolly his limit from his phone. His reason was I use it to squat. I told him there were weights with a bar outside and he told me no. So I told him the reason why he even has it is because I told my dad to bring it here when we moved. See, the bench used to belong to the owner of the house we used to rent. When we moved I told my dad to bring it here when my dad originally didn’t want to bring it. He got all bitchy and so I went to my mom. So finally my mom said we had to use it two days and switch. I told him that. He was like no mom said you can only use it for twos days and it’s mine again. So I told him you don’t have the right to give permission or not because it’s not yours. He goes well it’s not yours either. I’m literally the reason why it’s here!!!!!

16,1cgibem,AITA For ghosting my best friend after he prioritized his gf over me?,"I (16M) recently stopped responding to my best friend after he told me he was going out with his girlfriend rather than me. 

I have a tradition in my life where the people most important to me get to create a unique tradition we do every year together, on our “friendiversary“ (anniversary month of when we first started talking). It usually only spans the course of an evening, sometimes multiple days a week if we have time. This is incredibly important to me, more important than holidays and my own birthday.

  
I have done this for every major relationship in my life since my early tween years, even if im incredibly busy I clear my schedule and always make time as I take my relationships seriously and im very sentimental.

  
My best friend, let’s call him Zack (19M) I met a year ago (April) at his graduating school performance. Ever since then we just were really good friends and began talking every single day consistently. We are very close.

  
In the middle of April he went on an overseas vacation for 8 days. One where he was 7+ hours ahead of my timezone. I set time aside out of my day just to talk to him through that.

  
Before his vacation I tried to set up a time where we could get together and it just kept not working out. So then he goes on his vacation. Comes back and he still has a whole week of vacation time he’s spending back in our state.

  
I once again begin asking him when’s a good time to meet up, mentioning again how “we cant miss our friendiversary :(“ and he says he doesn’t know. No initiative to pick a day he's available.

  
Eventually I make plans with another friend and this last Friday I asked him. “Sunday is the last day we can all make it, the last day this month I can do, are you free?”

His response was short “Aw no I can’t, I have some errands in the morning and then Im spending the day over at gf’s house”

I was heartbroken, not only had I spent time getting him gifts and setting up times to go but I worked extra hard to complete all of my work and homework so my weekend would be clear for him. (I had offered several days that week)

  
I very sourly responded “Just forget it” late friday and ghosted him. Come sunday and I go out with my other friend and we have fun, still not talking to him. 

My reasoning for this being that I was incredibly upset and needed time to myself with people who actually would set time aside for me.

  
Every day he texted me things like “Are you okay bro?” “Im sorry” “Please tell me if I did something wrong I love you bro” “Im sorry” and I havent responded. He also began texting my friends asking for help and if I was okay. I have plans to text him Tue/Wed after I’ve slept it off.

(Additional context. Im lucky if I see my friends more than 16 times a year. I do all my schooling from home and online and rarely ever get to see my friends, we mainly talk online and play video games)

17,1cghlm2,AITA for telling my husband he poops too much?,"My husband poops several times a day. He makes 2-3 trips to the bathroom in the morning (right after waking up + right after breakfast), then at least three more times throughout the day. Each of these sessions is at least 20 minutes, and I know he is actually pooping, although he takes his phone with him (that's not the point of this post, I don't care about the phone). When I asked him why he poops so often, he told me he feels like he's bloated and needs to poop after each large meal. Recently, I lost my patience and told him that his pooping was affecting my life and that he needs to go to a doctor because this is completely abnormal. We have a kid and I find it annoying to have to accommodate my husband's pooping schedule among everything else we need to get done each day.

My husband poops several times a day. He makes 2-3 trips to the bathroom in the morning (right after waking up + right after breakfast), then at least three more times throughout the day. Each of these sessions is at least 20 minutes, and I know he is actually pooping, although he takes his phone with him (that's not the point of this post, I don't care about the phone). When I asked him why he poops so often, he told me he feels like he's bloated and needs to poop after each large meal. Recently, I lost my patience and told him that his pooping was affecting my life and that he needs to go to a doctor because this is completely abnormal.

19,1cghkys,AITA for taking care of a stray cat?,"I, (20f) was taking care of some strays that live in our backyard. For context, I don't usually mess with them too much, and usually try to stay out of their way. My mom usually takes care of them but has felt unwell the past few days hence why I was feeding them.

How they got here is that we had one cat who had five kittens and they've just hung around since then so they are very aware of us but will still let us feed them and get super close.

 Well, one of our strays had kittens inside a kennel outside and ever since then, ive been spoon feeding her wet cat food to give her more nutrients than regular kibble, and so that she doesn't teach her kittens to be afraid of humans. 

Yesterday, we had a huge thunderstorm and she was unable to come out due to the rain. I didn't want her to starve so I spoon fed her some wet cat food from the box with her kittens and she seemed ok with some pets too.

I accidentally touched one of the kittens because my hand slipped a bit but it was only slightly and i quickly changed my position so I wouldn't make the same mistake again. 

There was no sign of aggressive behaivor and i sat to the side so if she wanted to leave she could at any time. I was only around long enough to feed her. 

When i went to feed her again the next day, she didnt really show any signs of distance or weird behaivor out of the ordinary. But now, my mom told me that she moved the kittens and is now blaming me and telling me that she doesnt have much to look forward to other than the cats, and it really sucks how I couldn't just understand and leave them alone.

20,1cghk38,AITA for calling out my friend’s inconsiderate behavior and repeated failures to communicate?,"Throwaway as my friend uses Reddit, let’s call him “Sam.”

Last weekend while home for a concert I introduced my girlfriend to my family. Sam said he was carpooling with a coworker on Saturday for the show (we got in Friday). Sam gets to my parents’ house and texts me “we dropped off our stuff and are out walking.” Initially, I was confused because never once did we discuss this person ever staying with us. I don’t know this coworker well, we’ve talked maybe twice. They arrived to my very surprised mom. I pick up the pieces over text with Sam/my mother. Over text: “Omg I am so sorry, I thought it was implied, that is completely my bad.” followed by “100%, my bad, let’s talk about this later.” We get dinner and try to get to know this person. It’s clear that Sam doesn’t know our coworker well either.

My mom is a bit old-fashioned regarding sleeping arrangements etc. I’m sleeping on the couch while Sam and our coworker are in the same room, and my girlfriend in another. On Sunday we walk around and go thrifting before Sam departs for an art exho. Our coworker does not want to go and stays back as we kill time before the show. Sam meets us there and we have a great time. Later I ask Sam if we can chat and I ask at what point he thought it was okay for our coworker to stay with people she doesn’t know when he doesn’t even know her. Sam is defensive but ultimately asserts he’s sorry and too tired to get into the thoughts behind his actions. I appreciated it but it’s my mom who deserves an apology. He agrees, we table it. Then he realizes his phone’s in the car of our ride home from the concert, so we go retrieve his phone. We’re exhausted but we have at least time to discuss it further. His take: “Well why is it my responsibility to figure out where she’s sleeping?” I’m irked because he’s refusing to take accountability and won’t “talk in circles.” I realize he isn’t willing to consider intent vs. impact. We get the phone and I say I don’t want to have this fight or talk in circles but I need to make sure I’m fully heard. He sarcastically says “Oh you’ve been fully heard.” We abandon the conversation and say goodnight at 1AM, we’re leaving at 5 AM. Sam’s planning on leaving at 5:30 with our coworker. At 4 AM I get this text from Sam:

“Hey man, again I'm sorry, but this was bothering me and woke me up so I went through all my messages and I'm pretty sure there was a text to you that never sent asking if you were cool with _ being on the trip. It's still not the explicit asking for permission for her to stay with you that you're looking for, but that's partially what I was trying to ask. I'm not trying to justify myself, because I'm still in the wrong here, but I think that partially explains the origin of the miscommunication”

I’m jolted, and respond back with: “I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you for looking into it. Do you mean never sent as in not delivered or a message you thought you sent out?”

We broke up and got back together recently.
I have never felt like a priority in our relationship, as I was always the one planning, rescheduling to fit his needs, doing acts of service and bending over backwards to make it work.
Now that we got back together, to make an effort, he invited me to see an exposition of a movie franchise we are big fans of and that we bonded over in the beggining of our relationship. I was really excited, because we have not done anything like that in a long time, and it was something that showed that he still cared.
His mom will be getting a very simple surgical procedure in a month, and they haven't had some alone time between the two of them in a while. So today he texted me asking if he could take his mom, I thought he meant the 3 of us would go and I would be totally OK with it, but he was actually cancelling our plans to go with her alone.
I was upset because it was the first time in a long time he was going to take me to do something different, and now I will have to go by myself to the expo. It is important to clarify that this is basically a one time thing, as it is the first time it will ever be held where we live and I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to go again.
I told him I would be totally ok with him taking her out to dinner, taking her to see a movie she likes, go literally anywhere else by themselves and cancelling on anything else with me. But that this specific thing meant a lot to me and that I didn't feel good about him cancelling.
He told me to f*ing grow up, and that I should understand.

22,1cggtmg,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to day drink, and getting upset when he does?","I don’t make these posts often so please excuse me if the format is bad.

I (20M) have asked my boyfriend, “Mark”(20) on numerous occasions not to day drink (like vodka at 9AM) because I have childhood trauma involving alcoholics, and we both have struggled with addiction in the past. Each time I explain to him that I care about his health and I don’t want him to be drinking like that. I’ve also told him why it makes me uncomfortable. Each time, we get in a disagreement where he says he doesn’t think it’s “alcoholic behavior”.

This evening, me, Mark and my sister, “Lena”(30) were all hanging out in her house when the topic of what he did today came up. While talking, he said while he was out with his mom he ended up taking shots of tequila at 10:00 this morning. When he said this, I looked at him kind of disappointed and asked, “Tequila? That early?”. He just replied “Yeah?” And went on talking to my sister about his day.

At this point I just went quiet, because I didn’t want to say anything about it in front of Lena. I just sat there and scrolled through my phone for a while, until Mark looked at me and asked, “So do we need to have a talk later?” In a somewhat irritated tone. I was kind of surprised since I didn’t say anything else about it to him, but after a second of silence I said “I mean yeah, I guess we do.” And I shrugged. He then went on a tangent, in front of my sister, telling me that I need to “Just get over it” because he “doesn’t think that it’s bad or alcoholic.” And that he “shouldn’t have to change what he does.”

Lena eventually cut him off and stood up for me, telling him how she didn’t like how he was disrespecting me, and telling him how I never disrespect him the way he just did to me. At this point my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and could tell I was on the verge of having a panic attack. So I stood up, looked at both of them and told Mark that I was going out. I ended up getting in my car and leaving, just driving around for a while to calm down. The entire time he was texting me, saying he “didn’t know how he disrespected me” and that he didn’t like that I “just got upset and left like that” when we could have “had a quick talk” about it. 

Now that I’m back home with him, I feel like I’m in the wrong. I still have talked to him or even let him know that I’m back home yet. 

EDIT;

We finally sat down and talked. Both came to the conclusion that this is just not something we’ll both be able to agree on. He doesn’t drink too often so I think I can just deal with it. He promised we wouldn’t get drunk in the mornings, just one drink for fun.

I just needed to get this out there because I’m being bombarded with messages from my mom about how awful I am. 
So my fiancé and I are getting married in September of this year (2024). We have been planning this for over a year now and everything has been booked. The venue is a small place in the woods with some cabins to rent for either the wedding weekends or just camping in general. The issue is that there aren’t very many cabins/ rooms available. 
My grandma has some minor health issues that require her to use the restroom more frequently than most people. So she asked that when we get the code to book the cabins/rooms that we also give her the code so she can book herself a room. I made sure we booked the suites for our wedding party first before giving her the code. 
When I gave her the code to book I specifically said “I have the code for you to book your room. Please only book a room for yourself because Fiancé’s family is all out of state and will need to also book some of the rooms/cabins.” The venue is only 20 minutes from my family that I have invited. 
She booked 4 rooms. 
We didn’t bring anything up straight away because we were honestly just flabbergasted that she would do that when we specifically asked her to book just one room. 
Well we talked to her today to ask because the officiant tried to book and all the rooms are already sold out. So we called my grandma. Explained the situation how it is. We can’t get married without the officiant. Can you please release some of the rooms? Her response was “well we can just not go to the wedding at all then.” We explained to her that’s not what we wanted, but we need a room for the officiant. (The other 3 rooms were for my adult cousins who also live just 20 minutes away from the venue.) she said she didn’t want my cousins to drive in the dark. (They are adults and can make that decision themselves. All of them are in their early- late 20s.) 
The conversation ended with us saying if she feels like she doesn’t want to come anymore because of us asking for her to release some of the rooms then we won’t beg her to come. 
Now she has told all of her kids that I was super mean, rude, and an asshole for asking her to give up the rooms. Making it seem like we don’t want her or the cousins there. 
We never said she couldn’t keep HER room. We also never demanded she give up the rooms either. We were literally asking and trying to get her to see our dilemma of the officiant not being able to get a room.

24,1cggic1,AITA for getting upset when someone was talking on the phone while I was trying to sleep?,"Hello. So for context, I invited someone to join me for a weekend music festival. I paid for the tickets and accommodations and did not ask to be paid for it. On the last night of the festival, we got back to our hotel very late (or early morning), and we had to check out by 11am the following day. We both wanted to sleep as much as possible as we had a few hours drive home.

We had two separate beds in a single hotel room and we both laid down in our beds. She complained multiple times of the light shining through the window and she got up to adjust the curtains. I was scrolling through social media, as I do every night before bed, as it helps quiet my brain and tire me out. I ended up accidentally clicking on something with music and I quickly exited the post because I didn't want to disturb her, but she turned around and said, ""you're keeping me up!"" So, I actually put my phone away and tried to sleep so I wouldn't bother her. Five minutes later, as i was just about to drift off to sleep, she complained about the lights again and asked me if it was bothering me. I ignored the question, as I was on the verge of falling asleep and didn't want to ruin it, but it startled me anyway and I endedup laying there for about an hour trying to sleep.

In the morning, at 9am, she got a phone call and answered it. I was not ready to wake up yet as I hadn't slept well. I asked her if she could have her friend call her later, but she ignored me and continued to chat while I was trying to sleep. The second time I said, ""I'm trying to sleep"", and she ignored me again. The third time, I called her name, and once again she ignored me. I got up (visibly upset) and said, ""fine! It's too late now, I'm up!"" I was not loud at all, as I was mostly talking to myself, but making it clear to her that she woke me.

She quickly ended her phone conversation and got up and began yelling at me about how she is allowed to have a conversation on the phone if she wants to and emphasizing that her conversation was only 6 minutes long. I told her that it is rude to talk on the phone while someone is trying to sleep in the same room, but she persisted with her point and I basically ignored her and began packing to leave, so she did the same. 

We didn't talk about it the whole way home, but then when we got home, she agrily brought it up again and said that what I did in the morning wasn't cool. I told her that I didn't do anything and that what she did wasn't cool and it was just rude. Then we parted ways. So am I the  a-hole for getting upset that she woke me and ignored my pleas for sleep?

I was scrolling through social media, as I do every night before bed, as it helps quiet my brain and tire me out. I ended up accidentally clicking on something with music and I quickly exited the post because I didn't want to disturb her, but she turned around and said, ""you're keeping me up!"" So, I actually put my phone away and tried to sleep so I wouldn't bother her. Five minutes later, as i was just about to drift off to sleep, she complained about the lights again and asked me if it was bothering me. I ignored the question, as I was on the verge of falling asleep and didn't want to ruin it, but it startled me anyway and I endedup laying there for about an hour trying to sleep.

In the morning, at 9am, she got a phone call and answered it. I was not ready to wake up yet as I hadn't slept well. I asked her if she could have her friend call her later, but she ignored me and continued to chat while I was trying to sleep. The second time I said, ""I'm trying to sleep"", and she ignored me again. The third time, I called her name, and once again she ignored me. I got up (visibly upset) and said, ""fine! It's too late now, I'm up!"" I was not loud at all, as I was mostly talking to myself, but making it clear to her that she woke me.

She quickly ended her phone conversation and got up and began yelling at me about how she is allowed to have a conversation on the phone if she wants to and emphasizing that her conversation was only 6 minutes long. I told her that it is rude to talk on the phone while someone is trying to sleep in the same room, but she persisted with her point and I basically ignored her and began packing to leave, so she did the same. 

We didn't talk about it the whole way home, but then when we got home, she agrily brought it up again and said that what I did in the morning wasn't cool. I told her that I didn't do anything and that what she did wasn't cool and it was just rude. Then we parted ways. So am I the  a-hole for getting upset that she woke me and ignored my pleas for sleep?

My stepmom won a fancy wine/food basket which she told us she’d enjoy to all to herself as it was her prize and with the pregnancy/money troubles she said she deserved something just for her. About two days  later while at my moms  I got a text saying I won 

After collecting my prize my mom said I should spend it all on things I always wanted but we couldn’t afford, so I did I get nice shoes,perfumes,makeup etc

Here’s were I made a mistake I posted to social media about winning and what I got. Within 30 minutes dad called me and told me I was selfish and cruel to buy myself unnecessary crap while I knew they were struggling. Stepmom than got on the phone and asked how much I had left so I said 280 

She than asked would I return my stuff or at the very least give them the gift card so they could get stuff for the baby because I knew how bad they were struggling. I said no just like her gift basket it was Mine to keep. She started crying calling me names I couldn’t understand and dad took the phone saying he was disappointed in me and I’ve changed the way he views me.

In August of 2023 I put them on my phone bill. Huge mistake I know, but I just learned boundaries. They both got new phones totaling almost $1300 (now, after paying on them) for the phones and they owe me $420 (lol) for the actual bill.

When Sam and I decided to end the friendship, he told me he would pay me what he owed on the phone bill, then we would get them off my plan tomorrow. Well, 5 tomorrows have gone by and I reached out to Jo after discussing our options with my phone company.

I explained our options to Jo, Sam didn’t want to speak with me. They could pay the late bill, I would remove them from the plan and they would assume the responsibility of paying their own bill. They didn’t like that option. They told me they would pay it when they can, with no indication as to when.  

Then I told them my other option was to take them to small claims court. Over text they told me “you can get behind all the other creditors” then they both proceeded to berate me.

I cannot afford to cover over $1700. Would it be awful to report the phone stolen to the police? I know that won’t help me get the money back, but my phone company said they can claim them stolen under my insurance plan with them if I have a police report. Then I get my money back. I did explain the full situation to my phone company. 

I already suspended their service, and black listed the phones so they can’t be sold or used by other providers.

I think I may be the AH because Sam and Jo   do not know what the legal consequences of stealing is. He doesn’t know that you can’t just give the stuff back, or that it can carry jail time and a fine. My family and friends say I should, but I hate doing it to someone who was my friend.
 It’s horrible that our relationship has come down to this. Before this we had ended it pretty civilly. 

Edit: I have text messages from Sam refusing to return them, and they are both in my name. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-30,"WIBTA if I file a police report for stolen phones? So I (26f) had a 20 year friendship with my friend Sam (25m), I am also friends with his wife Jo (24f).

36,1cgf1ij,AITA for telling my mom that I don’t want her to brag about me? (Very short and simple),"*Note this is my first ever AITA post. I never felt compelled enough to bring my issues to the internet but after years of this happening I just needed to talk about something small.

I (15, NB) may be young but I really need to talk about this. My mother (49, F) has treated me in a certain way all my life, sometimes when she does change she doesn’t do it forever. 

Just a few minutes ago my mom was very affiliated with what I was drawing because it’s about the recent TikTok debate of “Would you rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or a man?” I was just doing art to make my statement and I know if Ms.”Mommygottaknow!” Sees it she would accuse me of seeing disgusting things and take things away from me. 

All I said was that I was drawing a bear and she kept insisting that she should see it like she does with a lot of things I make. She just asked if she could have a copy of the art and for once I said that I do not want it shared with other people. She said directly to me “So I’m not allowed to brag and show my own daughter?” 

(My mom has also brought an undercover transphobia around me, ever since I’ve came out she still refuses to use my preferred pronouns or name and because “Oh I’m your mother I don’t HAVE TO! But your friends can call you that and I’ll still love you” but I guess it’s her right.)  

I told her “well I don’t want you to brag about me. I like it if you can keep it to yourself sometimes.” This is the first time in 4 years I’ve said something like that and first thing she said to me was “There are kids who beg for their parents to be proud and brag about them.” And walked away. I’ve been slightly upset the rest of the night and start to think I’m the dick here. Am I actually the asshole here?

Edit 1 (besides the note from earlier)
thank you everyone said something about it. I feel like next time finally I can say something to her.

37,1cgevs6,AITA: My mother had my ex (narcissist and abusive) contact my eldest child (not his) to tell my youngest son (his) happy birthday and I said no?,"TLDR: My ex-boyfriend blocked me after I got mad that he wouldn't help with his son that he guilts everyone about not having a relationship with - so my mother tells him to contact my other child (12) to avoid speaking to me. I don't let him have unsupervised contact with my son because he's emotionally abusive and my son is autistic.

-----

In the middle of March, I needed help financially and I don't ever ask my ex for help for anything because he's always broke. He doesn't call his child, he refuses to try and spend time with him, and says he feels awful for not having any money so he doesn't want to look bad *eye roll*. I asked him for just $40, and he said no which is fine - I get it you're broke. He then went off on me for acting like I'm holier that thou (meaning that I don't complain to him or often appear to him to need financial help) which yes upset me - and I told him that was not fair and he yelled and got loud calling me a narcissist.

I (not proudly) reacted by yelling that he deserved all the pain that he gets. He hung up on me and blocked me on everything. Out of pettiness, I blocked him also because haha if you unblock me you're blocked (I know, childish).

My eldest child (12, and not his child) has had him blocked because they have nightmares after he texts them. They have CPTSD because of the emotional turmoil this man put us through, so even in kind conversation - anxiety rises, depression comes back, etc. 

Today my mom calls me and tells me that my ex has been trying to get ahold of my eldest child (12, not his) so he can talk to his son, my youngest. I was immediately appalled and told her it was very inappropriate for him to be going through my kid for this. She doesn't see a problem with it. She knew I had him blocked but did not know he had also blocked me. So to see if he had attempted to reach out - I unblocked him only to see I was still blocked from his end. 

I told her that if he wants to be a part time parent to look decent by just saying happy birthday and not being willing to do anything else for his child, he'd at least have to be an adult and contact me to do this. Not my other child. He says he will not. My mom is upset because she says 'She just wanted him to tell his son Happy Birthday' (we won't get into the fact it sounds like this was all her idea and he may not have had the thought in the first place). She is telling me I'm responsible for keeping him out of his life and acting like the only factor in this is that I blocked him.

38,1cgepq4,AITA for nagging my roommate to be cleaner?,"Hey there everyone! I'm a university student (m20) living in Germany with another student (f20) who's from outside of the country. We moved in together about 8 months ago on a convenience basis. We were mild acquaintances before but no friendship that needs/needed salvaging.

This is where my question starts. Since we moved in together, I've had to be the proactive person in getting furniture, setting up systems, and reaching out to various organizations (we had a pest problem a while back, unrelated to any of our doing), because she wouldn't ever do stuff, even if she offered to (I learnt that the hard way). Since then, with all the large organizational stuff out of the way, its been a lot easier to live with her in general.

But I've also been nagging her a lot about being clean. Mainly, my irritation stemmed from an unclean kitchen and living room. It's worth noting here that I have high standards for cleanliness, especially for a uni student, as the opposite reminds me of a dark depression cycle I had a few years back. Since then, this has gotten significantly better. I am still the person that cleans the floors in the apartment and the finer details (stovetop for example), but I'm fine with that (even if she has expressed multiple times that she does so too, which I know not to be the case).

Recently, I asked her to move some of her stuff off of our communal balcony and put it on hers (she has her own balcony, I don't), and to clean up cigarettes and dirt on the floor from her using it over winter (I don't smoke). I don't intend to stop her from doing so on the communal balcony, but rather to not make it front and center for my use of it. She reacted negatively to this, saying that she always tries to see things from my point of view, but that it always feels like she's getting none of that in return.

I can understand why she feels like this, especially with how many times I have asked about certain stuff. However, this has mainly been because she hasn't followed through on doing what she said she would. I get that everyone has their off days, I do too. But its when things stay for a week or more that I get rather annoyed. The balcony is a place I haven't touched over winter, so its state has only been influenced by her use over the last months.

I also am planning on living here with her for the next 2-3 years. Generally, I'm quite happy with the situation now, and I don't want to move; in case anyone was going to throw that out there. I pick my battles, but it just seems that I am the only one asking anyone to clean.

Final point: she's from a different cultural background than me, with a different standard of cleanliness. Thats fine, and compromise is warranted on both sides. But am I asking for too much?
