Within know us for a few minutes it's really easy to tell us apart and is really no issue. We both had a friend who I will call T. T is non-binary and wanted to go by the name they felt comfortable with. All of our friends were super cool with that and very supportive about it. Well one day T decide it would be funny to only call me by my twins name. It was funny the first few times but quickly got old, so I told them to stop. They didn't. For the entire time they would not stop calling me by my twins name. So they asked me for something ""hey (insert twins name) can you hand me something"" I responded yea followed by their dead name. They go really quite and told me to never call them that. Simply responded by telling them to never call me by my twins name. Later that day I sent an apology, and to this day I still feel really bad about, but I tried to explain to them that it also made me upset when I was called by a name I wasn't comfortable with.

1,1ch2v7f,AITA for rejecting my trans (ex) friend?,"This story is almost a year old, but imma tell it anyway. 

I, (19M) knew a friend in high school (19 FTM) who liked before he came out as trans. When he still identified as a girl, he rejected me and kinda ghosted me for 2 years. This was sophomore year, back when Covid was rampant and people were in quarantine. 

Fast forward to my senior year, literally the last day, I’m getting teachers to sign my yearbook, and he asks me to sign his. I sign his in return, and I basically wrote a big apology for two years ago bc of how I didn’t talk to him (secretly, I thought I was the reason he became trans).

After that day, we started talking again over the phone, just casually and catching up basically. We talked about college plans, memes, how we’re doing in our own friend groups. 

Not even 2 weeks pass before my other friend just hits me with a, “You know he has a crush on you, right?”

This is because they were talking and my trans friend told my other friend about his feelings for me.

I hoped that my friend would just let these feelings wash over and pass on, but he then confessed over text. 

At first, I easily smoothed things over, but my big mouth just had to ask why he even had feelings, and when I got the “I don’t know” text, I was just stricken. Not the “mad” kind, but “disappointed.” 

To sum it up, I basically said “I wish you had these feelings when you still identified as a girl” and that “I had feelings for (deadname), not (current name)”, basically invalidating him. 

We stopped talking after that, even when I apologized for my actions. He didn’t want to be friends anymore, and I accepted that.

FF again to December 2023, and I decide to send one last apology to him, mainly because I felt guilty for the last 6 months and wanted to take accountability, to which he rejected with anger. I didn’t argue with him and left it with a final goodbye.

This isn’t something I linger over, but I have to ask, AITA?

2,1cgw02s,AITA for not apologizing for making fun of my brothers chest? ,"Well. I can’t believe I’m asking strangers on the internet this, but I feel like I’m going nuts. 



I(25F) am not a small woman. Or at least my thighs and butt aren’t. Everything else? Very slight. I’ve had two separate women try to give me the nickname ‘baby tits’. One VERY ex boyfriend told me that I was ‘lucky he had an avocado fetish’. It’s just the way I am, whether I’m actively playing sports or shut up indoors in winter, I am, to quote shitty fashion magazines, a pear. 



Which doesn’t bother me, I think I look fine, but for some reason invites the fucking opinions of everyone else. Especially my little brother. 



For the last eleven years he (24M) has been taking every shot he can at me. From the most juvenile ‘what’s up? Besides your butt’ to playing that one line from the heathers musical soundtrack whenever I walked into the room, he’s been making fun of my butt for over a decade. Everytime I tried yo get our parents to make him stop I would get scolded for not being more mature, for ‘letting him’ hurt my feelings, for not just ignoring him, etc etc.



Here’s the thing. My brother is a trans man. Female to male. Which is great! He’s much happier as ‘Alex’ than he was as \*redacted\*. I’m very happy for him. 



Now. Because god thinks he’s fucking funny Where as all of my fat gathered squarely in my butt and thighs, he got incredibly big breasts. Even if he hadn’t started transitioning, he would have had to get reduction surgery for the sake of his back. 



I was in town visiting our parents a couple weeks ago and his fiancé was there. The three of us were in the kitchen and wouldn’t you know it, but he called me ‘big booty Judy’ right in front of his fiancé. 



I finally snapped and said, ‘oh yeah, too bad I couldn’t have boobs half as big as my baby brothers.’ 



He shut up and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. 



My mom was furious for risking triggering his dysphoria and for making fun of him in front of his girlfriend. She tried to get me to write him a letter apologizing and I refused. Now every conversation I have with her somehow turns into her trying to weasel a promise out of my that I’ll never say it again and that I’ll say I’m sorry. 



Funny enough, my brother hasn’t said shit about my butt since then.

So I'm a 30 year old trans woman. I'm three years into my transition. My friends have all been supportive, my work has been supportive, and my mother is doing her best to learn. The people who seem to be having issues are my dad and brother.

So as part of my transition, I've been growing my hair out and it's gotten quite long. I'm still getting used to things like straightening it and getting rid of knots, but I'm trying my best.

5,1cgjbiv,AITA for saying my boyfriend is trying too hard to be like his best friend,"So me and my bf met in university and we’ve been dating for a few months now. Ever since, I’ve known he was super close with his one best friend since childhood (lets call him Mike), and originally, to me, they just looked like a bunch of best friends that liked doing everything together.

When I started to get closer to Mike and his girlfriend, I started to notice some… odd things, I guess. Like how Sam originally wanted to go to another uni but changed his mind to come to this one because Mike was here, started attending piano lessons because Mike was doing it, etc. 

He even started “picking up” on Mike’s interests, for example, at first, I was a mild anime fan and he would kind of make fun of me for it, but the moment Mike started watching it, my bf had put anime posters in his room and told me he was into it now. When we go shopping, he would buy stuff that I know for a FACT Mike has, but then when they would “coincidentally” run into each other wearing the same stuff, my boyfriend would act all surprised and be like “I didn’t know you had that” when he clearly did. He would also always play music that Mike recommended to him and said that he didn’t need to make Spotify playlists because he would just listen to Mike’s or whatever. 

I also found out that Mike had started dating his gf like, a month before my bf started dating me, and I think we’ve gone on more “double dates” with them than actual dates on our own. Or we would go somewhere and “coincidentally” Mike and his gf would be there. 

Anyway Mike’s gf also noticed the same thing when I was talking to her, but she says Mike doesn’t notice anything out of the ordinary and that he is used to my bf acting this way. However the final straw for me was when Mike said he planned to go to Mexico over Summer break with his gf, and now my bf is trying to convince me to go to Mexico so we can have a couples retreat or whatever with Mike and his gf. I told him to stop trying to be Mike so hard, and my bf got super angry and said I was being delusional.

Middle was full, left lane has the pump on the right (my trucks gas cap is on the left) so I pulled to the far right one. There was another truck not fully pulled up so i had to go around and reverse into said pump. I attempted to reverse but my truck was too big and the person behind me was too close. Once i realized it was best to not attempt to inch as close as possible to the guy behind me (my truck has a hitch with a cooler on it, adds about 2 feet) I simply drove forward and around to the far left lane.

 I rolled my window down and heard a guy yelling. To my surprise, the gas attendant was yelling at me to leave. I thought he was just trying to be funny so i smiled and said whats the problem? At this point a random woman came and started holding this guy back! I said seriously what’s going on? He said “you whip around this place like that? I’m a human being! You’re not getting gas here! You can take it up with my manager tomorrow!” 

I shook my head and left because the guy clearly has a few screws loose but looking back I’m genuinely curious if I did something wrong. Note I did not exceed 5mph to go around to the new pump it’s a very tight area. Curious to hear your guys’ thoughts. ",,0.9798345,1,0
10,1cgionx,AITA for not giving away my shirt to my uncle?,"Honestly, I think this is extremely stupid, but here goes. Also, English isn't my native language, and I am typing from the phone.

I (23F) and my mother have a close relationship, but with rough edges, like anyone else.  As is normal where we live, we generally give things that we do not use or need to other family members who need them, and unfortunately it is very common to force children to give their toys to cousins ​​or siblings younger than them.  She and I have fought a lot about it in the past, and it's gotten a lot better, but recently another issue of that nature came up.

 My boyfriend has (or well, had, because I wear it) a fairly thick dress shirt with a very nice print, it is really of very good quality, but unfortunately it is at least three or four sizes larger than it should be ( long story as to how he got it, is irrelevant), and logically he never uses it, because it looks like a waste.  Since he doesn't use it, he gave it to me so I could wear it as pajamas, and I honestly adore it.  It's like a huge warm and soft nightgown.

 A few days ago, my mother saw the shirt and commented (somewhat insistently) that it would be good for me to give it to my uncle F, because it is his size, and it would fit him very well, since it is practically a high quality shirt. new.  I, who have some problems saying no, told her I would think about it and thought she would forget about it, until yesterday, when we went to visit some relatives and she saw the shirt again (I took it with me in my pajamas, because we spent the night there), and he offered it and practically gave it directly to my uncle who was there, and even showed it to him so he could measure it.  Unfortunately, it was her exact size, and she quite liked the print and fabric.

 Then I spoke privately with her, told her directly that I would not give away my pajamas, and that she had no right to offer or give away my things, no exceptions.  She understood, but she said she wasn't giving away my things.  We didn't argue, but it was pretty awkward, and we basically agreed to disagree.

11,1cgimqt,AITA for paying for my (33F) husband's birthday (36M)?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years, together for 7. He has struggled with his birthday the entire time I've known him, although he's never able to articulate why. The only reason he has ever really given is that they make him feel unloved. He doesn't know where this stems from.

As a result, I made it a mission to make all of his birthdays special. I wanted him to always feel loved, and while I have definitely gone a little over the top on occasion, they're usually well with the range of a normal birthday (gifts, decorations, cake, and taking him out somewhere). He hates when I spend money on him, but he can't articulate why that is, either. We both work.

This year, we're doing the usual gifts & cake, but he asked if we and some friends of ours could go golf together. I checked with our friends and they're free, so I was going to book tee times. When my husband found out I intended to pay for our friends, though,  he came unraveled.

It became a fight. He doesn't want me to pay for their fee and was extremely emotional about it. I strongly feel like I should pay for them. They can definitely afford it, but as the inviter I feel like it's only appropriate to cover their fee. Also, I already told them I was paying when I invited them and to top it off, the additional fee to cover them is only $50. I kept trying to reason with him (I'm his wife, I l WANT to do nice things for him, it's his birthday, etc.) but he just got increasingly more upset that I wasn't listening to him. I tried to ask to talk about it tomorrow but he said he didn't want to talk about it.

It's not a finance issue. We aren't rich but we are comfortable and the money being spent is my ""play"" money. He said I've stressed him out so much that he doesn't even want to go and, well, ditto. It's draining to try so hard every year only to be met with a ""meh"" at best, but not trying would make him feel unloved so that's not an option.

I eventually gave up and told him we would do whatever he wanted but, honestly, I'm not happy with his reaction.

So there’s this workout bench that has adjustable height. I wanted to use it to work my lower abs. So I went to ask my brother could I use it. He asked why and already that was a stupid question. It’s a workout bench do you need anymore answers? I told him I needed it and then he told me no because he’s using it. Mind you this dude is always on his phone 24/7. If he did use it it was prolly for like a good 10 minutes because that’s prolly his limit from his phone. His reason was I use it to squat. I told him there were weights with a bar outside and he told me no. So I told him the reason why he even has it is because I told my dad to bring it here when we moved. See, the bench used to belong to the owner of the house we used to rent. When we moved I told my dad to bring it here when my dad originally didn’t want to bring it. He got all bitchy and so I went to my mom. So finally my mom said we had to use it two days and switch. I told him that. He was like no mom said you can only use it for twos days and it’s mine again. So I told him you don’t have the right to give permission or not because it’s not yours. He goes well it’s not yours either. I’m literally the reason why it’s here!!!!!

16,1cgibem,AITA For ghosting my best friend after he prioritized his gf over me?,"I (16M) recently stopped responding to my best friend after he told me he was going out with his girlfriend rather than me. 

I have a tradition in my life where the people most important to me get to create a unique tradition we do every year together, on our “friendiversary“ (anniversary month of when we first started talking). It usually only spans the course of an evening, sometimes multiple days a week if we have time. This is incredibly important to me, more important than holidays and my own birthday.

  
I have done this for every major relationship in my life since my early tween years, even if im incredibly busy I clear my schedule and always make time as I take my relationships seriously and im very sentimental.

  
My best friend, let’s call him Zack (19M) I met a year ago (April) at his graduating school performance. Ever since then we just were really good friends and began talking every single day consistently. We are very close.

  
In the middle of April he went on an overseas vacation for 8 days. One where he was 7+ hours ahead of my timezone. I set time aside out of my day just to talk to him through that.

  
Before his vacation I tried to set up a time where we could get together and it just kept not working out. So then he goes on his vacation. Comes back and he still has a whole week of vacation time he’s spending back in our state.

  
I once again begin asking him when’s a good time to meet up, mentioning again how “we cant miss our friendiversary :(“ and he says he doesn’t know. No initiative to pick a day he's available.

  
Eventually I make plans with another friend and this last Friday I asked him. “Sunday is the last day we can all make it, the last day this month I can do, are you free?”

His response was short “Aw no I can’t, I have some errands in the morning and then Im spending the day over at gf’s house”

I was heartbroken, not only had I spent time getting him gifts and setting up times to go but I worked extra hard to complete all of my work and homework so my weekend would be clear for him. (I had offered several days that week)

  
I very sourly responded “Just forget it” late friday and ghosted him. Come sunday and I go out with my other friend and we have fun, still not talking to him. 

My reasoning for this being that I was incredibly upset and needed time to myself with people who actually would set time aside for me.

  
Every day he texted me things like “Are you okay bro?” “Im sorry” “Please tell me if I did something wrong I love you bro” “Im sorry” and I havent responded. He also began texting my friends asking for help and if I was okay. I have plans to text him Tue/Wed after I’ve slept it off.

(Additional context. Im lucky if I see my friends more than 16 times a year. I do all my schooling from home and online and rarely ever get to see my friends, we mainly talk online and play video games)

17,1cghlm2,AITA for telling my husband he poops too much?,"My husband poops several times a day. He makes 2-3 trips to the bathroom in the morning (right after waking up + right after breakfast), then at least three more times throughout the day. Each of these sessions is at least 20 minutes, and I know he is actually pooping, although he takes his phone with him (that's not the point of this post, I don't care about the phone). When I asked him why he poops so often, he told me he feels like he's bloated and needs to poop after each large meal. Recently, I lost my patience and told him that his pooping was affecting my life and that he needs to go to a doctor because this is completely abnormal. We have a kid and I find it annoying to have to accommodate my husband's pooping schedule among everything else we need to get done each day.

My husband poops several times a day. He makes 2-3 trips to the bathroom in the morning (right after waking up + right after breakfast), then at least three more times throughout the day. Each of these sessions is at least 20 minutes, and I know he is actually pooping, although he takes his phone with him (that's not the point of this post, I don't care about the phone). When I asked him why he poops so often, he told me he feels like he's bloated and needs to poop after each large meal. Recently, I lost my patience and told him that his pooping was affecting my life and that he needs to go to a doctor because this is completely abnormal.

19,1cghkys,AITA for taking care of a stray cat?,"I, (20f) was taking care of some strays that live in our backyard. For context, I don't usually mess with them too much, and usually try to stay out of their way. My mom usually takes care of them but has felt unwell the past few days hence why I was feeding them.

How they got here is that we had one cat who had five kittens and they've just hung around since then so they are very aware of us but will still let us feed them and get super close.

 Well, one of our strays had kittens inside a kennel outside and ever since then, ive been spoon feeding her wet cat food to give her more nutrients than regular kibble, and so that she doesn't teach her kittens to be afraid of humans. 

Yesterday, we had a huge thunderstorm and she was unable to come out due to the rain. I didn't want her to starve so I spoon fed her some wet cat food from the box with her kittens and she seemed ok with some pets too.

I accidentally touched one of the kittens because my hand slipped a bit but it was only slightly and i quickly changed my position so I wouldn't make the same mistake again. 

There was no sign of aggressive behaivor and i sat to the side so if she wanted to leave she could at any time. I was only around long enough to feed her. 

When i went to feed her again the next day, she didnt really show any signs of distance or weird behaivor out of the ordinary. But now, my mom told me that she moved the kittens and is now blaming me and telling me that she doesnt have much to look forward to other than the cats, and it really sucks how I couldn't just understand and leave them alone.

20,1cghk38,AITA for calling out my friend’s inconsiderate behavior and repeated failures to communicate?,"Throwaway as my friend uses Reddit, let’s call him “Sam.”

Last weekend while home for a concert I introduced my girlfriend to my family. Sam said he was carpooling with a coworker on Saturday for the show (we got in Friday). Sam gets to my parents’ house and texts me “we dropped off our stuff and are out walking.” Initially, I was confused because never once did we discuss this person ever staying with us. I don’t know this coworker well, we’ve talked maybe twice. They arrived to my very surprised mom. I pick up the pieces over text with Sam/my mother. Over text: “Omg I am so sorry, I thought it was implied, that is completely my bad.” followed by “100%, my bad, let’s talk about this later.” We get dinner and try to get to know this person. It’s clear that Sam doesn’t know our coworker well either.

My mom is a bit old-fashioned regarding sleeping arrangements etc. I’m sleeping on the couch while Sam and our coworker are in the same room, and my girlfriend in another. On Sunday we walk around and go thrifting before Sam departs for an art exho. Our coworker does not want to go and stays back as we kill time before the show. Sam meets us there and we have a great time. Later I ask Sam if we can chat and I ask at what point he thought it was okay for our coworker to stay with people she doesn’t know when he doesn’t even know her. Sam is defensive but ultimately asserts he’s sorry and too tired to get into the thoughts behind his actions. I appreciated it but it’s my mom who deserves an apology. He agrees, we table it. Then he realizes his phone’s in the car of our ride home from the concert, so we go retrieve his phone. We’re exhausted but we have at least time to discuss it further. His take: “Well why is it my responsibility to figure out where she’s sleeping?” I’m irked because he’s refusing to take accountability and won’t “talk in circles.” I realize he isn’t willing to consider intent vs. impact. We get the phone and I say I don’t want to have this fight or talk in circles but I need to make sure I’m fully heard. He sarcastically says “Oh you’ve been fully heard.” We abandon the conversation and say goodnight at 1AM, we’re leaving at 5 AM. Sam’s planning on leaving at 5:30 with our coworker. At 4 AM I get this text from Sam:

“Hey man, again I'm sorry, but this was bothering me and woke me up so I went through all my messages and I'm pretty sure there was a text to you that never sent asking if you were cool with _ being on the trip. It's still not the explicit asking for permission for her to stay with you that you're looking for, but that's partially what I was trying to ask. I'm not trying to justify myself, because I'm still in the wrong here, but I think that partially explains the origin of the miscommunication”

I’m jolted, and respond back with: “I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you for looking into it. Do you mean never sent as in not delivered or a message you thought you sent out?”

We broke up and got back together recently.
I have never felt like a priority in our relationship, as I was always the one planning, rescheduling to fit his needs, doing acts of service and bending over backwards to make it work.
Now that we got back together, to make an effort, he invited me to see an exposition of a movie franchise we are big fans of and that we bonded over in the beggining of our relationship. I was really excited, because we have not done anything like that in a long time, and it was something that showed that he still cared.
His mom will be getting a very simple surgical procedure in a month, and they haven't had some alone time between the two of them in a while. So today he texted me asking if he could take his mom, I thought he meant the 3 of us would go and I would be totally OK with it, but he was actually cancelling our plans to go with her alone.
I was upset because it was the first time in a long time he was going to take me to do something different, and now I will have to go by myself to the expo. It is important to clarify that this is basically a one time thing, as it is the first time it will ever be held where we live and I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to go again.
I told him I would be totally ok with him taking her out to dinner, taking her to see a movie she likes, go literally anywhere else by themselves and cancelling on anything else with me. But that this specific thing meant a lot to me and that I didn't feel good about him cancelling.
He told me to f*ing grow up, and that I should understand.

22,1cggtmg,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to day drink, and getting upset when he does?","I don’t make these posts often so please excuse me if the format is bad.

I (20M) have asked my boyfriend, “Mark”(20) on numerous occasions not to day drink (like vodka at 9AM) because I have childhood trauma involving alcoholics, and we both have struggled with addiction in the past. Each time I explain to him that I care about his health and I don’t want him to be drinking like that. I’ve also told him why it makes me uncomfortable. Each time, we get in a disagreement where he says he doesn’t think it’s “alcoholic behavior”.

This evening, me, Mark and my sister, “Lena”(30) were all hanging out in her house when the topic of what he did today came up. While talking, he said while he was out with his mom he ended up taking shots of tequila at 10:00 this morning. When he said this, I looked at him kind of disappointed and asked, “Tequila? That early?”. He just replied “Yeah?” And went on talking to my sister about his day.

At this point I just went quiet, because I didn’t want to say anything about it in front of Lena. I just sat there and scrolled through my phone for a while, until Mark looked at me and asked, “So do we need to have a talk later?” In a somewhat irritated tone. I was kind of surprised since I didn’t say anything else about it to him, but after a second of silence I said “I mean yeah, I guess we do.” And I shrugged. He then went on a tangent, in front of my sister, telling me that I need to “Just get over it” because he “doesn’t think that it’s bad or alcoholic.” And that he “shouldn’t have to change what he does.”

Lena eventually cut him off and stood up for me, telling him how she didn’t like how he was disrespecting me, and telling him how I never disrespect him the way he just did to me. At this point my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and could tell I was on the verge of having a panic attack. So I stood up, looked at both of them and told Mark that I was going out. I ended up getting in my car and leaving, just driving around for a while to calm down. The entire time he was texting me, saying he “didn’t know how he disrespected me” and that he didn’t like that I “just got upset and left like that” when we could have “had a quick talk” about it. 

Now that I’m back home with him, I feel like I’m in the wrong. I still have talked to him or even let him know that I’m back home yet. 

EDIT;

We finally sat down and talked. Both came to the conclusion that this is just not something we’ll both be able to agree on. He doesn’t drink too often so I think I can just deal with it. He promised we wouldn’t get drunk in the mornings, just one drink for fun.

I just needed to get this out there because I’m being bombarded with messages from my mom about how awful I am. 
So my fiancé and I are getting married in September of this year (2024). We have been planning this for over a year now and everything has been booked. The venue is a small place in the woods with some cabins to rent for either the wedding weekends or just camping in general. The issue is that there aren’t very many cabins/ rooms available. 
My grandma has some minor health issues that require her to use the restroom more frequently than most people. So she asked that when we get the code to book the cabins/rooms that we also give her the code so she can book herself a room. I made sure we booked the suites for our wedding party first before giving her the code. 
When I gave her the code to book I specifically said “I have the code for you to book your room. Please only book a room for yourself because Fiancé’s family is all out of state and will need to also book some of the rooms/cabins.” The venue is only 20 minutes from my family that I have invited. 
She booked 4 rooms. 
We didn’t bring anything up straight away because we were honestly just flabbergasted that she would do that when we specifically asked her to book just one room. 
Well we talked to her today to ask because the officiant tried to book and all the rooms are already sold out. So we called my grandma. Explained the situation how it is. We can’t get married without the officiant. Can you please release some of the rooms? Her response was “well we can just not go to the wedding at all then.” We explained to her that’s not what we wanted, but we need a room for the officiant. (The other 3 rooms were for my adult cousins who also live just 20 minutes away from the venue.) she said she didn’t want my cousins to drive in the dark. (They are adults and can make that decision themselves. All of them are in their early- late 20s.) 
The conversation ended with us saying if she feels like she doesn’t want to come anymore because of us asking for her to release some of the rooms then we won’t beg her to come. 
Now she has told all of her kids that I was super mean, rude, and an asshole for asking her to give up the rooms. Making it seem like we don’t want her or the cousins there. 
We never said she couldn’t keep HER room. We also never demanded she give up the rooms either. We were literally asking and trying to get her to see our dilemma of the officiant not being able to get a room.

24,1cggic1,AITA for getting upset when someone was talking on the phone while I was trying to sleep?,"Hello. So for context, I invited someone to join me for a weekend music festival. I paid for the tickets and accommodations and did not ask to be paid for it. On the last night of the festival, we got back to our hotel very late (or early morning), and we had to check out by 11am the following day. We both wanted to sleep as much as possible as we had a few hours drive home.

We had two separate beds in a single hotel room and we both laid down in our beds. She complained multiple times of the light shining through the window and she got up to adjust the curtains. I was scrolling through social media, as I do every night before bed, as it helps quiet my brain and tire me out. I ended up accidentally clicking on something with music and I quickly exited the post because I didn't want to disturb her, but she turned around and said, ""you're keeping me up!"" So, I actually put my phone away and tried to sleep so I wouldn't bother her. Five minutes later, as i was just about to drift off to sleep, she complained about the lights again and asked me if it was bothering me. I ignored the question, as I was on the verge of falling asleep and didn't want to ruin it, but it startled me anyway and I endedup laying there for about an hour trying to sleep.

In the morning, at 9am, she got a phone call and answered it. I was not ready to wake up yet as I hadn't slept well. I asked her if she could have her friend call her later, but she ignored me and continued to chat while I was trying to sleep. The second time I said, ""I'm trying to sleep"", and she ignored me again. The third time, I called her name, and once again she ignored me. I got up (visibly upset) and said, ""fine! It's too late now, I'm up!"" I was not loud at all, as I was mostly talking to myself, but making it clear to her that she woke me.

She quickly ended her phone conversation and got up and began yelling at me about how she is allowed to have a conversation on the phone if she wants to and emphasizing that her conversation was only 6 minutes long. I told her that it is rude to talk on the phone while someone is trying to sleep in the same room, but she persisted with her point and I basically ignored her and began packing to leave, so she did the same. 

We didn't talk about it the whole way home, but then when we got home, she agrily brought it up again and said that what I did in the morning wasn't cool. I told her that I didn't do anything and that what she did wasn't cool and it was just rude. Then we parted ways. So am I the  a-hole for getting upset that she woke me and ignored my pleas for sleep?

I was scrolling through social media, as I do every night before bed, as it helps quiet my brain and tire me out. I ended up accidentally clicking on something with music and I quickly exited the post because I didn't want to disturb her, but she turned around and said, ""you're keeping me up!"" So, I actually put my phone away and tried to sleep so I wouldn't bother her. Five minutes later, as i was just about to drift off to sleep, she complained about the lights again and asked me if it was bothering me. I ignored the question, as I was on the verge of falling asleep and didn't want to ruin it, but it startled me anyway and I endedup laying there for about an hour trying to sleep.

In the morning, at 9am, she got a phone call and answered it. I was not ready to wake up yet as I hadn't slept well. I asked her if she could have her friend call her later, but she ignored me and continued to chat while I was trying to sleep. The second time I said, ""I'm trying to sleep"", and she ignored me again. The third time, I called her name, and once again she ignored me. I got up (visibly upset) and said, ""fine! It's too late now, I'm up!"" I was not loud at all, as I was mostly talking to myself, but making it clear to her that she woke me.

She quickly ended her phone conversation and got up and began yelling at me about how she is allowed to have a conversation on the phone if she wants to and emphasizing that her conversation was only 6 minutes long. I told her that it is rude to talk on the phone while someone is trying to sleep in the same room, but she persisted with her point and I basically ignored her and began packing to leave, so she did the same. 

We didn't talk about it the whole way home, but then when we got home, she agrily brought it up again and said that what I did in the morning wasn't cool. I told her that I didn't do anything and that what she did wasn't cool and it was just rude. Then we parted ways. So am I the  a-hole for getting upset that she woke me and ignored my pleas for sleep?

My stepmom won a fancy wine/food basket which she told us she’d enjoy to all to herself as it was her prize and with the pregnancy/money troubles she said she deserved something just for her. About two days  later while at my moms  I got a text saying I won 

After collecting my prize my mom said I should spend it all on things I always wanted but we couldn’t afford, so I did I get nice shoes,perfumes,makeup etc

Here’s were I made a mistake I posted to social media about winning and what I got. Within 30 minutes dad called me and told me I was selfish and cruel to buy myself unnecessary crap while I knew they were struggling. Stepmom than got on the phone and asked how much I had left so I said 280 

She than asked would I return my stuff or at the very least give them the gift card so they could get stuff for the baby because I knew how bad they were struggling. I said no just like her gift basket it was Mine to keep. She started crying calling me names I couldn’t understand and dad took the phone saying he was disappointed in me and I’ve changed the way he views me.

In August of 2023 I put them on my phone bill. Huge mistake I know, but I just learned boundaries. They both got new phones totaling almost $1300 (now, after paying on them) for the phones and they owe me $420 (lol) for the actual bill.

When Sam and I decided to end the friendship, he told me he would pay me what he owed on the phone bill, then we would get them off my plan tomorrow. Well, 5 tomorrows have gone by and I reached out to Jo after discussing our options with my phone company.

I explained our options to Jo, Sam didn’t want to speak with me. They could pay the late bill, I would remove them from the plan and they would assume the responsibility of paying their own bill. They didn’t like that option. They told me they would pay it when they can, with no indication as to when.  

Then I told them my other option was to take them to small claims court. Over text they told me “you can get behind all the other creditors” then they both proceeded to berate me.

I cannot afford to cover over $1700. Would it be awful to report the phone stolen to the police? I know that won’t help me get the money back, but my phone company said they can claim them stolen under my insurance plan with them if I have a police report. Then I get my money back. I did explain the full situation to my phone company. 

I already suspended their service, and black listed the phones so they can’t be sold or used by other providers.

I think I may be the AH because Sam and Jo   do not know what the legal consequences of stealing is. He doesn’t know that you can’t just give the stuff back, or that it can carry jail time and a fine. My family and friends say I should, but I hate doing it to someone who was my friend.
 It’s horrible that our relationship has come down to this. Before this we had ended it pretty civilly.

36,1cgf1ij,AITA for telling my mom that I don’t want her to brag about me? (Very short and simple),"*Note this is my first ever AITA post. I never felt compelled enough to bring my issues to the internet but after years of this happening I just needed to talk about something small.

I (15, NB) may be young but I really need to talk about this. My mother (49, F) has treated me in a certain way all my life, sometimes when she does change she doesn’t do it forever. 

Just a few minutes ago my mom was very affiliated with what I was drawing because it’s about the recent TikTok debate of “Would you rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or a man?” I was just doing art to make my statement and I know if Ms.”Mommygottaknow!” Sees it she would accuse me of seeing disgusting things and take things away from me. 

All I said was that I was drawing a bear and she kept insisting that she should see it like she does with a lot of things I make. She just asked if she could have a copy of the art and for once I said that I do not want it shared with other people. She said directly to me “So I’m not allowed to brag and show my own daughter?” 

(My mom has also brought an undercover transphobia around me, ever since I’ve came out she still refuses to use my preferred pronouns or name and because “Oh I’m your mother I don’t HAVE TO! But your friends can call you that and I’ll still love you” but I guess it’s her right.)  

I told her “well I don’t want you to brag about me. I like it if you can keep it to yourself sometimes.” This is the first time in 4 years I’ve said something like that and first thing she said to me was “There are kids who beg for their parents to be proud and brag about them.” And walked away. I’ve been slightly upset the rest of the night and start to think I’m the dick here. Am I actually the asshole here?

Edit 1 (besides the note from earlier)
thank you everyone said something about it. I feel like next time finally I can say something to her.

I don't let him have unsupervised contact with my son because he's emotionally abusive and my son is autistic.

-----

In the middle of March, I needed help financially and I don't ever ask my ex for help for anything because he's always broke. He doesn't call his child, he refuses to try and spend time with him, and says he feels awful for not having any money so he doesn't want to look bad *eye roll*. I asked him for just $40, and he said no which is fine - I get it you're broke. He then went off on me for acting like I'm holier that thou (meaning that I don't complain to him or often appear to him to need financial help) which yes upset me - and I told him that was not fair and he yelled and got loud calling me a narcissist.

I (not proudly) reacted by yelling that he deserved all the pain that he gets. He hung up on me and blocked me on everything. Out of pettiness, I blocked him also because haha if you unblock me you're blocked (I know, childish).

My eldest child (12, and not his child) has had him blocked because they have nightmares after he texts them. They have CPTSD because of the emotional turmoil this man put us through, so even in kind conversation - anxiety rises, depression comes back, etc. 

Today my mom calls me and tells me that my ex has been trying to get ahold of my eldest child (12, not his) so he can talk to his son, my youngest. I was immediately appalled and told her it was very inappropriate for him to be going through my kid for this. She doesn't see a problem with it. She knew I had him blocked but did not know he had also blocked me. So to see if he had attempted to reach out - I unblocked him only to see I was still blocked from his end. 

I told her that if he wants to be a part time parent to look decent by just saying happy birthday and not being willing to do anything else for his child, he'd at least have to be an adult and contact me to do this. Not my other child. He says he will not. My mom is upset because she says 'She just wanted him to tell his son Happy Birthday' (we won't get into the fact it sounds like this was all her idea and he may not have had the thought in the first place).

38,1cgepq4,AITA for nagging my roommate to be cleaner?,"Hey there everyone! I'm a university student (m20) living in Germany with another student (f20) who's from outside of the country. We moved in together about 8 months ago on a convenience basis. We were mild acquaintances before but no friendship that needs/needed salvaging.

This is where my question starts. Since we moved in together, I've had to be the proactive person in getting furniture, setting up systems, and reaching out to various organizations (we had a pest problem a while back, unrelated to any of our doing), because she wouldn't ever do stuff, even if she offered to (I learnt that the hard way). Since then, with all the large organizational stuff out of the way, its been a lot easier to live with her in general.

But I've also been nagging her a lot about being clean. Mainly, my irritation stemmed from an unclean kitchen and living room. It's worth noting here that I have high standards for cleanliness, especially for a uni student, as the opposite reminds me of a dark depression cycle I had a few years back. Since then, this has gotten significantly better. I am still the person that cleans the floors in the apartment and the finer details (stovetop for example), but I'm fine with that (even if she has expressed multiple times that she does so too, which I know not to be the case).

Recently, I asked her to move some of her stuff off of our communal balcony and put it on hers (she has her own balcony, I don't), and to clean up cigarettes and dirt on the floor from her using it over winter (I don't smoke). I don't intend to stop her from doing so on the communal balcony, but rather to not make it front and center for my use of it. She reacted negatively to this, saying that she always tries to see things from my point of view, but that it always feels like she's getting none of that in return.

I can understand why she feels like this, especially with how many times I have asked about certain stuff. However, this has mainly been because she hasn't followed through on doing what she said she would. I get that everyone has their off days, I do too. But its when things stay for a week or more that I get rather annoyed. The balcony is a place I haven't touched over winter, so its state has only been influenced by her use over the last months.

I also am planning on living here with her for the next 2-3 years. Generally, I'm quite happy with the situation now, and I don't want to move; in case anyone was going to throw that out there. I pick my battles, but it just seems that I am the only one asking anyone to clean.

41,1ch7m1r,AITA for stranding a former friend at a restaurant?,"A few days ago, my (now former) friend Katie (22F), my girlfriend Asia (21F), and I (22M) were at a restaurant. (A few other friends were too, but they aren't important to the story). Asia is African-American and I'm white and we started dating a month ago but have been friends for over a year. Because it's important to the story, Katie is also white.

  
Anyway, we gave Katie a ride and while we were eating, the topic came up that Asia and I were dating. Katie gives us a weird look and said oh, she didn't expect that.

  
A bit puzzled, I said I told you I was dating Asia. To which she said she assumed I was dating a white girl named Asia.

  
This immediately pissed me off. Asia asked why she assumed that, which is when Katie dropped this, ""Well, because you're black.""

  
We were both confused because we didn't think she had a problem with interracial dating. Honestly, we probably should have left then. I commented that she's dating an Indian man, to which she said yes, but he has darker skin than her, so it's okay. She went on to explain how it's okay and socially acceptable for women to date men with darker skin but not okay for men to date women with darker skin.

  
Asia and I both said that was racist and colorist. Katie further put her foot down on the point and said she didn't mind we were dating, but it was just odd. She kept reiterating that she wasn't racist because her boyfriend was from India and had darker skin than her.

  
Asia and I left, but not before I told Katie that I feel sorry for her boyfriend.

  
Anyway, later that night Katie texted Asia saying we were cruel for what we said and for abandoning her at the restaurant, and she felt uncomfortable riding getting an Uber and riding with a stranger. (We both paid for our meals and left. She kept saying she wasn't done, but we didn't care). 

  
I received a similar text. I asked her to apologize which she refused to do and reiterated that she didn't nothing wrong and it should be me and Asia who apologized. I just laughed at her and blocked her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-30,"AITA for stranding a former friend at a restaurant? A few days ago, my (now former) friend Katie (22F), my girlfriend Asia (21F), and I (22M) were at a restaurant. (A few other friends were too, but they aren't important to the story). Asia is African-American and I'm white and we started dating a month ago but have been friends for over a year. Because it's important to the story, Katie is also white.

  
Anyway, we gave Katie a ride and while we were eating, the topic came up that Asia and I were dating. Katie gives us a weird look and said oh, she didn't expect that.

  
A bit puzzled, I said I told you I was dating Asia. To which she said she assumed I was dating a white girl named Asia.

  
This immediately pissed me off. Asia asked why she assumed that, which is when Katie dropped this, ""Well, because you're black.""

  
We were both confused because we didn't think she had a problem with interracial dating. Honestly, we probably should have left then. I commented that she's dating an Indian man, to which she said yes, but he has darker skin than her, so it's okay. She went on to explain how it's okay and socially acceptable for women to date men with darker skin but not okay for men to date women with darker skin.

  
Asia and I both said that was racist and colorist. Katie further put her foot down on the point and said she didn't mind we were dating, but it was just odd. She kept reiterating that she wasn't racist because her boyfriend was from India and had darker skin than her.

  
Asia and I left, but not before I told Katie that I feel sorry for her boyfriend.

  
Anyway, later that night Katie texted Asia saying we were cruel for what we said and for abandoning her at the restaurant, and she felt uncomfortable riding getting an Uber and riding with a stranger. (We both paid for our meals and left. She kept saying she wasn't done, but we didn't care). 

  
I received a similar text. I asked her to apologize which she refused to do and reiterated that she didn't nothing wrong and it should be me and Asia who apologized. I just laughed at her and blocked her. 

  
Though I feel bad for abandoning her at the restaurant, especially since I do know that she gets anxious and even had a panic attack when in a car with someone she doesn't know or doesn't know well. (As for why she didn't get a ride from others we knew there, I don't know).

42,1ch7lf9,AITA for hiding food from my brothers?,"I (18F) have been hiding food in my closet from the household pantry for a little over 2 years now because of my ravenous teenage brothers (14 & 16M). Every month when the groceries come in they go through a month of snacks and drinks in a week. My mom argues that since they're going through puberty, they're going to eat a lot more. But the amount of food they eat is atrocious. For example I've seen the youngest eat TWO frozen Digorno's pizzas, as if they were tacos, in one sitting.

It eventually came to the point where they leave a very small portion of food, if any, left for me when me or my mom cooks a meal and leaving empty containers and boxes in the pantry. Keep in mind my mom usually buys things in bulk to last us for the month.

Because of this I've started hiding packaged foods like ramen, water bottles, and chips for times when I don't get enough to eat or when the quick prep foods run out early. Sometimes if I have the money I'll by myself a treat or two. My mom eventually caught on that I was hiding food and reprimanded me for being selfish. She says that the food she buys isn't mine to take or hide, and if I buy food for myself I have to get the boys something too.

43,1ch7hkt,AITA For Not Wanting to Deal With My Mom's Anxiety?,"I (21f) live with my mom and grandparents, and have for the past few years. My mom has a pretty big anxiety disorder, specifically related to noise. Unfortunalty, our neighborhood is a pretty loud one; there are food trucks and neighbors that play loud music pretty late at night - the exact stuff that sets her off.

Usually we just call the police on them, and that's that; but recently, my mom has been getting more extreme with how she reacts to it. Normally, she'll just yell inside the house for a while and we'll stay out of the way until she cools off, and stuff calms down. For the past couple of weeks, though, she's started going outside and standing on our porch, staring at the people making the noise; and sometimes even yelling at them. This is super embarassing for me and my grandparents, and we also worried that she might escalate things into something physical. In the past, me or my grandmother have sometimes been able to talk her down; but now if we try to get her to go inside she'll yell at us, and sometimes even push us. Now that my younger brother is off at college, we don't have the manpower to pull her inside (me and my grandmother are pretty small, and my mom works out and surfs, so we can't make her move).

Last night, she went out to the curb, and had a full-on scream fight with our neighbors, who had a super loud food truck parked in front of their house for around two hours, at about 8 at night. I wasn't a fan of it either, but I don't want her making a huge scene and possibly putting herself in danger, or getting arrested. I was trying to get her to go inside, but she ignored me. Finally, I gave up and called my boyfreind, who came over to help. For context, my boyfreind (19) is a pretty punk looking guy; he's intimidating enough that he was able to get everyone to sort of calm down and go inside.

I could tell she was upset, but I was basically just humiliated, so I went with my boyfreind back to his place; even though she didn't want me too. Ever since, she's been blowing up my phone with texts about how she knew that me and my brother would get sick of her and leave, and how sorry she is, and how she wouldn't blame me if I never talked to her again.

I really love my mom, and we're very close - when she isn't doing this, we're really good freinds; so I don't want to abandon her. But I hate being stressed out everytime the sun starts going down, because I'm afraid that this stuff will start. I've noticed that, even when she's out of the house, or I'm out in public alone, I get tense if I hear loud noises/music.

AITA for not wanting to put up with this anymore?

  
Update: I forgot to add that she has tried therapy, but left because she felt like it wasn't doing anything.

44,1ch71sl,AITA for wanting to wear my sister's (29) clothes?,"I (18F) was about to clean my room yesterday with the vacuum cleaner, so when I went to search where it were at, I ended up finding 2 whole sacks full of old clothing to donate that weren't touched since 1-2y ago.

I went to tell my mom about it and she said I could give a look into the whole sack, since they were very old and my sister didn't  miss it, so I began to wear some of the ""old"" clothes I liked.

My mother told me she even have threw her clothes in the trash recently, not considering to donate, so I couldn't have it, but since the second time it turned out differently, I thought she wouldn't mind.

My sister came home after work and my mom told her, and she is now pissed off. She said I'm going to rob her style from her and that I need new clothes (even though her clothes aren't old), that will not fit her style, when I actually wouldn't like to wear her style at all.

46,1ch6y5n,AITA for swearing at a classmate?,"Throwaway because I don’t know how many of my classmates use Reddit. And on mobile and first time posting, please bear with me.

I (15f) have a class with my best friend. We’re not what you’d call ‘popular’ my any means, but we do have a friend group of our own (who aren’t in this class with us). The problem is, sometimes my friend gets picked on for the things she likes, or for whatever other reason I can’t fathom. Point is, she gets picked on in this class by one of the ‘popular’ kids and her friends. I’m talking making faces, jeering, the whole lot of funny business in high school. My friend usually either tries to defend herself, or flips them off right back (which isn’t the best option, I know, but it hasn’t stopped even after telling the teacher and asking her to keep an eye out).

So today, one such event happened. These girls were across the room, teacher wasn’t stepping in, making comments such as ‘can we get a woof, [friend]? Can we get a meow?’ My friend flipped them off (which, I know, probably spurred them on, but it’s hard for both of us to ignore this kind of thing when it happens. 

Here’s when I might be the A-hole.

After all of this, I was now standing next to my friend and talking to her (we had some time to catch up on work and were free to talk), when the girl who’s been causing the most problems walked by, looked right over at us, and said ‘me-yooow!’. This ticked me off, and after days and days of witnessing it, I spoke up and snapped at her (entire class present, including the teacher at her desk)

“You’re a bitch”

After that, most of the class went silent and then started laughing. The girl was also laughing, but at that point I had no shits left to give. I don’t know if the class was laughing because I was being stupid, or if it was a nervous laugh (I don’t tend to speak up a ton in class unless I’m talking to my friend).

Afterwards, my friend thanked me profusely and explained to the teacher what had been happening after she looked up from her computer. The girl got called over, and I don’t know the whole exchange of what happened. All I know is that the girl and her friends left laughing and making fun of my words, but I didn’t care.

But now, I know I coulda handled it differently. I know I shouldn’t have said that, but I honestly feel like she deserved it in that moment. My friend still thinks it was awesome and told me I’m amazing.

48,1ch6lok,WIBTA for kicking my ex out of our rented home,"I ( currently 28) moved in with my then-partner (currently 32) a couple of years ago. When we agreed to move in together, we agreed to split the cost of living 50/50 since we reportedly made about the same amount of money.

On the week we were to sign the lease, suddenly he didn't have his half of the deposit. I agreed to make up the difference if he agreed to pay me back, he agreed.

As soon as we moved in, he suddenly claimed he didn't agree to pay half of the moving company cost and that he'd only pay 30% because he had less stuff than me. I backed down quickly because my memory can be unreliable sometimes and it wasn't worth the fight. 

Then the first full month's rent came due and he was short a couple hundred bucks and couldn't help with the power bill. He didn't tell me this until rent was already due. It kept happening like that over and over - me telling him that I needed more warning and him not doing it. He eventually claimed that he thought I was paying the whole power and internet bills since he was paying the garbage bill. The garbage bill is less than just the internet alone and that isn't what we agreed to.

I then brought out the booklet where we wrote down all of the things we agreed to upon moving in together. I showed him where we broke down EVERYTHING down to which streaming service each person agreed to pay separately. He apologized and agreed with me, then a couple of times over the course of 1 year he gave me a few hundred bucks for the power bill (which Was 300 Per month).

Eventually I did the math on how much I spent on groceries and I came to him and said I'm paying 1000 on household shopping and we need to get the budget under control. He said it's fine and nothing needs to change.

Then the breakup happened. I won't get into why. When we broke up I told him that I wouldn't help him anymore.

He got a 2nd job and things were fine for like 2 months. Then he got fired from that 2nd job. Then he got into a head-on collision and couldn't work ANY job. I agreed to pay the full power bill and all of the groceries on the basis that he would pay his full half of rent for the 2 months he couldn't work and that he'd be back to paying for himself by the 3rd month. 

It is month 2 of this arrangement and he will be late on rent (last minute notice). I have someone moving in next month who was GOING to be our 3rd roommate but she can afford to live here just the two of us. And she wants it to be just us.

I know he has nowhere to go - not even a car to sleep in. We have been broken up for 6 months.

And he isn't even respectful of my money. Asking for things he doesn't need like for me to keep 3 kinds of juice, soda, and tea. I spend every morning/night, and most of my breaks/lunches with him since he isnt working. He'll do my laundry for me, make breakfast or lunch or dinner. Rubs my feet to help me get to sleep. Every nice thing he does makes me feel more trapped. I just want out. ",Not enough info,2024-04-30,"WIBTA for kicking my ex out of our rented home I ( currently 28) moved in with my then-partner (currently 32) a couple of years ago. When we agreed to move in together, we agreed to split the cost of living 50/50 since we reportedly made about the same amount of money.

On the week we were to sign the lease, suddenly he didn't have his half of the deposit. I agreed to make up the difference if he agreed to pay me back, he agreed.

As soon as we moved in, he suddenly claimed he didn't agree to pay half of the moving company cost and that he'd only pay 30% because he had less stuff than me. I backed down quickly because my memory can be unreliable sometimes and it wasn't worth the fight. 

Then the first full month's rent came due and he was short a couple hundred bucks and couldn't help with the power bill. He didn't tell me this until rent was already due. It kept happening like that over and over - me telling him that I needed more warning and him not doing it. He eventually claimed that he thought I was paying the whole power and internet bills since he was paying the garbage bill. The garbage bill is less than just the internet alone and that isn't what we agreed to.

I then brought out the booklet where we wrote down all of the things we agreed to upon moving in together. I showed him where we broke down EVERYTHING down to which streaming service each person agreed to pay separately. He apologized and agreed with me, then a couple of times over the course of 1 year he gave me a few hundred bucks for the power bill (which Was 300 Per month).

Eventually I did the math on how much I spent on groceries and I came to him and said I'm paying 1000 on household shopping and we need to get the budget under control. He said it's fine and nothing needs to change.

Then the breakup happened. I won't get into why. When we broke up I told him that I wouldn't help him anymore.

(This is relevant) He is visibly autistic BUT he is not intellectually disabled or anything. She used to talk about how she feels sorry for him because he is always on his own. She told me she’s thinking of letting him in her friend group, I said good, kudos to you. Few months ago he began to hang out with my gf and her friends. 

Fast forward to now, he constantly texts or snaps her. Like we be chilling out and gf’s phone gets bombarded with messages from him, sometimes I check when she leaves the room it’s not something inappropriate , just random stuff. He’s on her insta dms too, giving her bunch of compliments. He also compliments when I’m standing right there too , and idk, I know friends compliments each other but it annoys me because it’s just so obvious he has a crush on her, which she denies. 

I was already annoyed by all of this and yesterday I find out they sometimes hang out together alone, separate from rest of the group. She told me it’s cus he gets overwhelmed in groups. I asked so does he hang outs with everyone one on one, she said “idk probably not, he’s not close with others the way he’s with me” I said what do you mean, “the way” she said you know he’s not as close as with them. I asked what they do in these hangouts, she laughed and asked if I’m jealous , then said they usually go for a dinner, they saw a movie together once, went to picnic once, you know what friends they just do what normal friends to.

Long story in short I basically told her I don’t want them to be this close , i know it’s not it but these hangouts kinda sounds like they are going on dates, she said I’m being ridiculous. “You know what he’s like , I would never see him that way “ I said i know , but he sees you that way, the looks and compliments he’s giving you tells all.

51,1ch5u9l,AITA for telling someone they're not special or a better person for owning a cat?,"I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this, but here we go.

I was recently getting dinner with a few friends who I'll call Jim, Rachel, Blake, Ray, and Cassity, though only Jim, Rachel, and Blake are important to the story. 

First, Jim has a cat. He always talks about how his cat secretly hates him and how cats hate their owners and plotting against them. Fine, it's a dumb overblown joke (and I question anyone who seriously believe cats hate their owner), but I tolerate it.

However, the last time we hung out, Jim, Rachel, and Blake brought up how cats only accept attention on their own terms and it means that people who own cats or like cats better than other animals are more empathetic and understand consent better than everyone else.

Rachel specifically said that left winged people only own cats while it's right winged people who own dogs, but I digress. I am pretty left winged, but they ignored that point, though I would like to get my dog a kitty friend soon.

They said their proof is that unlike dogs, cats only tolerate a certain amount of affection. I brought up that dogs also have a limited threshold for attention and some dogs get annoyed if you smother them too much and some cats can't get enough of it. I also know people who force affection on their cat and have a former friend who is extremely far right who prefers cats.

They rolled their eyes and accused me of lying. So I said (and I'm sure this will get me termed the AH by many people) that fine, if cats having a limited threshold for attention means people who own them understand consent and are empathetic, then they must also enjoy putting animals and people into abusive relationships since in their own words, cats hate their owner and are plotting against them. They're forcing their cats to stay in a one sided relationship and if they (the owners) weren't abusers, they wouldn't force creatures who hate them to live with them against their will.

(And before anyone says anything, no, I do not believe that. It was a joke and an attempt to prove a point, while Jim, Rachel, and Blake honestly believe the empathy and consent thing).

They told me to grow up, and that I was just trying to be rude and make them look stupid.

52,1ch5h5t,AITA for not wanting to share my gym equipment?,"My partner and I have recently set up a home gym. It’s nothing fancy but it definitely gets the job done. We purchased a smith machine and a cable machine, both secondhand. We also have some free weights and a small elliptical. 

We bought the equipment mainly for me, as my partner isn’t big into working out. In addition, the home gym is in the basement right next to my home office (I work from home often).

Since we put it together, my partner’s cousin has been bothering him about starting a workout program together. My partner isn’t really interested as he is very busy with work (physical job) and doesn’t want to commit, but was toying with the idea. When he told me this, I quickly reacted by saying absolutely not. 

I’ve been struggling with articulating this to my partner so I will do my best to describe my feelings here:

1. I have no interest in seeing this cousin on a regular basis, which would need to be the case if they were to have a dedicated program. 
2. I don’t want him to use our set up and wear out our equipment. 
3. I want the space free for when I want to use it as I have a busy schedule and I have no interest in sharing it with anyone other than my partner. 

I guess my question is, does this sound reasonable or selfish on my end? 

My big concern is that my partner is kind of a people pleaser and because of that, he will let his cousin push him. And then this would cause an argument between him and I about it being his equipment too and he can let whoever use it if he wants.",No A-holes here,2024-04-30,"AITA for not wanting to share my gym equipment?

54,1ch59me,AITA: Don’t want flatmate to renew lease,"I live in a reasonably priced 3-bed in London, coming up to the end of our 3rd year-long tenancy in July.

All rooms are nice. There are 2 smaller (almost identical) rooms, one of which is mine. 

Since the beginning, I have lived with a good friend, Alex, who has the other smaller room. Until 2 months ago, the large room was occupied by our other good friend, Bailey. The largest room is 1.8x the seize of smaller rooms, but only 1.08x the price. This agreed based on what we could all afford when we first moved in, but all our salaries increased and so it’s no longer equitable.

As Bailey began looking to buy property in Nov, they asked if Alex and I would let them sublet their room for the remainder of the tenancy. We agreed on Charlie who was looking to move to London. Charlie was a stranger, but a managee of a friend. Alex and I had one FaceTime with Charlie before they moved in. 

A week before Bailey completed on buying their property, the agents sent a tenancy agreement Charlie until the end of the original term, in July.

I explained that Alex and I had agreed on a subletter, but the landlord insisted on a new tenancy. Bailey got antsy, insisting that not signing this agreement would jeopardise their future plans. I that I was being asked to do something I was deeply uncomfortable with, especially because through multiple tenancies I have chosen to never sign a legal contract with someone that either I, or another good friend who will also be a tenant, know before. 

I suspect Bailey might have actually known it wouldn’t be a sublet, but it could have been their lack of communication with the agent. In the end, I relented for the sake of the friendship with Bailey. Note, Charlie is not aware of any of this and no one has ever mentioned anything beyond July to them.

Charlie is ‘just fine’ - Alex and I feel no connection over these 2 months. There is now a constant air of awkwardness and I don’t feel at home anymore. Charlie is very quiet and stay in their room a lot. Alex and I have tried to engage them, but there isn’t much engagement back - they only really speak when spoken to. Alex and Iused to cook with our old flatmate- we’ve asked Charlie and they aren’t interested. I invited Charlie to a dinner with our friends, including their line manager who both the new tenant and I are friends with, and they spent the whole time on their phone. Charlie is a bit younger and feels at a very different stage of life.

If the landlord wants us to renew, they will send through an offer in mid-May. Alex and I agree that we don’t want to live with Charlie for what will be 14 more months from when we’d sign the contract. Alex and I want to stay and have someone else move in. We have 3 people who are interested and we already know. However, I understand that legally we have no leg to stand on by asking Charlie to leave while we stay. I’m just at such a loss for what to do.

At the will reading, my brother volunteered to be the will executer (liquidator). I agreed with him because it is also the oldest who get those responsibilities in our family.

So, I started a conversation with my brother about what we should do and that I wanted to take care of the house (cleaning, throw out the old cloths and food...). He said that he didnt need my help and to sit and wait. He changed the busted door and lock. Now I don't have access to the house.

He also asked me for a salary, because ""I don't want my work to benefit you in any manner."". If I refused, he would give up his role and give it to a lawyer or notary. Now, I have to say that he is a CEO of his company and has millions in the bank and I am jobless and full of anxiety  (due to abuse in my childhood and teenage years). So, he said that it will cost us around 20k to 30k if someone else were to take care of it and he doesn't mind paying because ""unlike you, I can afford it.""  So I had to agree and he had me put it on paper.

I had a panic attack, because after all that he still refused to give me access to the house. I wanted to get a momento and clean because I felt I needed it to say goodbye. I told him all that, but he said it wasn't necessary. I was so angry and sad and anxious that I had a break down and told him I would go hang myself in the house to spite him. 

I told him it was wrong of me to say that because I didn't mean it and I would never do it. He agreed by saying he never saw me like that before and it was out of character. BUT now he is holding it over my head and telling me I am not mentally stable, so he can't give me acces to the house.

He succeeded in breaking my spirit, I had to stop fighting for my mental health. So, instead I can only keep watch and wait.

So, now I am asking him update on the procedure. I ask him for proof of his transactions, I am asking for all the results of the appraisals of my father assets. So far, he gave me nothing (because by law, he only has to do it once everything is finished).

He is getting angry and told me I am asking too many questions and I am demanding too much by asking for copies of everything. I put too much pression on him. Our mother is telling me to stop speaking to him and to stop asking him questions. Some of my friends also say I should wait for it to end and stop speaking to him.

Now, I am still asking him when the process will be finished nand i only get ""I dont know, I will tell you if there is something."" It has been weeks and I keep asking and people keep telling me to stop putting pressur on him.

Also, he won't steal from me, but you can be sur he will profit of any loopholes to get more.

Now, I have to say that he is a CEO of his company and has millions in the bank and I am jobless and full of anxiety  (due to abuse in my childhood and teenage years). So, he said that it will cost us around 20k to 30k if someone else were to take care of it and he doesn't mind paying because ""unlike you, I can afford it.""  So I had to agree and he had me put it on paper.

I had a panic attack, because after all that he still refused to give me access to the house. I wanted to get a momento and clean because I felt I needed it to say goodbye. I told him all that, but he said it wasn't necessary. I was so angry and sad and anxious that I had a break down and told him I would go hang myself in the house to spite him. 

I told him it was wrong of me to say that because I didn't mean it and I would never do it. He agreed by saying he never saw me like that before and it was out of character. BUT now he is holding it over my head and telling me I am not mentally stable, so he can't give me acces to the house.

He succeeded in breaking my spirit, I had to stop fighting for my mental health. So, instead I can only keep watch and wait.

So, now I am asking him update on the procedure. I ask him for proof of his transactions, I am asking for all the results of the appraisals of my father assets. So far, he gave me nothing (because by law, he only has to do it once everything is finished).

He is getting angry and told me I am asking too many questions and I am demanding too much by asking for copies of everything. I put too much pression on him. Our mother is telling me to stop speaking to him and to stop asking him questions. Some of my friends also say I should wait for it to end and stop speaking to him.

Now, I am still asking him when the process will be finished nand i only get ""I dont know, I will tell you if there is something."" It has been weeks and I keep asking and people keep telling me to stop putting pressur on him.

Also, he won't steal from me, but you can be sur he will profit of any loopholes to get more.

So, AITA for pressuring my brother about getting update and copies of the papers?",0.0,1.0459400415420532,1,0
56,1ch528t,AITA for wanting to charge a classmate for asking me to study with them?,"Im currently in university and as you suspect, very close to the end of my spring semester. Because I need a language credit this year I decided to just take an easy A and enroll in a spanish 101 class. As a fluent spanish speaker i thought this would be a good gpa booster and at least fulfill my full time enrollment with this course. 
I took AP spanish in high school as well so it’s not my first time taking spanish as a fluent speaker. 
We are in the last few weeks of the semester so it’s just projects and papers and exams thus far. I, knowing I won’t be stressed out, have put my spanish class in the rear view, since it’s my easiest class. After almost completing this semester my class mate (lets call them Jan) decided to approach me asking for study help. I have been going to class every day with Jan and I can tell they have a pretty good grasp of the material and have a fair understanding of what we’re learning. I help Jan in class as well if they have any questions. 

After talking to me in class about study help, Jan emailed me letting me know days and times they are available.

However, I find it kind of ignorant on Jan’s part to want to ask for study help, right before we have a project due in this class, that I also need to complete, along with multiple project and exams in my other 3 classes. 
If Jan wanted help, don’t you think they would ask me earlier on? Especially since i’ve been helping Jan in class throughout the semester and they never mentioned study help at any other point. 
I haven’t responded to the email yet because i genuinely have no idea what to do…
My friends all say that i should charge Jan because it is quite an inconvenient time of the semester to be taking time out of my own busy schedule to help someone else. 
I’m not against helping others at all, I’m even planning on starting a tutoring business for spanish next semester… in the fall.

I just feel that a couple weeks before the semester ends, is kind of crazy. 

I have my own things going on as well. My days always start between 6:15-6:30am, when i go to the gym, walk my dog, make breakfast, go to class, homework/study time, work, along with any other engagements i have going on. 

My days don’t end around 10 or 11 when I can finally decompress and either do homework or finally get to sleep, before repeating the cycle over again the next day.

I don’t want to be rude and decline but If i were to accept i strongly believe i would charge them.

I got so much more advice than I was expecting, and I appreciate it. A lot of you were saying the airline could do something. I told that to my ex, and she actually bought the tickets from a discount agency online and there was no refund possibility. If you’re curious, I can tell you how it all ended.  

I eventually told my ex that I was not going to pay her more than the $800 for my ticket under any circumstances, and she could take it or leave it and I’d just get my own ticket. She later asked if I’d be willing to let her use the AirBnb if she paid me the entire $1600, basically letting me out of the whole trip all together. To be honest, the Canary Islands were her idea in the first place. It’s not like it’s my #1 destination. I could take the money and go somewhere that I am more interested in. 

I asked my friend who was going to go with me if he’d be interested in something cheaper and closer. He hadn’t bought his plane ticket yet because he was waiting for me to sort everything out with my ex. 

We looked at options and decided to accept her offer and go to Belize. I had my ex agree in writing to pay for any fees or damages incurred at the AirBnb. I really don’t think there will be any. She’s not the type of person to damage a hotel room or something, but I just want to be sure. 

I got Venmoed the money by a male coworker of hers. They have been work friends for a while now, and I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know if this is like a couple’s thing or what. I don’t really think she cheated on me with him. I could see maybe her being interested in him possibly being a factor for our breakup. But I don’t even know if they are together or going as friends. 

At the end of the day, I don’t really care what she does. I got my money back, she gets her vacation. I’m guessing her coworker also bought his own plane ticket, so at the end of the day he’s the one eating the $800 loss. So he can have fun with that.

60,1ch4tsf,AITA for re-folding my laundry when my wife's not watching?,"Fair warning, this probably comes across as very petty. Nevertheless, I look forward to your verdicts.

My wife and I both do the laundry, depending on who's at home and what needs washing.

I have a particular way I would like my laundry to be folded, and explained to her how I want it folded. However, she keeps folding it differently, stating that thinking about folding laundry is not something she wants to spend energy on, she does it on auto pilot.

I try to fold her laundry the way she always folds hers, but she won't do the same for me. Since this is important to me, I will occasionally take my folded clothes, and re-fold them the way I like it. However, this upsets her because it invalidates her efforts of folding the laundry.

As a compromise I told her she does not need to fold my laundry, just leave it somewhere so I can do it myself. She did not think this was a good compromise, as she is already spending time on doing the laundry, she wants to have the satisfaction of finishing the task.

This has been going on for a very long time, and I have come to accept that she optimizes for minimizing energy spent on folding laundry, while I optimize for maximizing ease of access to clean items in my wardrobe. So I stopped bringing this topic up with her, however, I can't stop myself from occasionally reorganizing the clothes in my wardrobe after she folded another batch 'her way'.

61,1ch4kbi,AITA for wanting my cat’s ashes?,"My (23m) family (55m, 53f, 22m) cat died last week. She wasn’t doing well Thursday and my parents decided to bring her to the vet Friday without telling me or my brother. Friday morning she got worse, and they rushed her to the vet. I was home but still asleep and they didn’t wake me up to say goodbye. The vet basically said she’s probably already dead but if she isn’t, we have to give her the shot to relieve her of her pain (she was still twitching so it’s possible there was a heartbeat, but if there was, it was really faint and the vet couldn’t find it). My parents opted for the “simple cremation,” which means that our cat was put in a bunch with several other dead animals to be cremated in a group, and we wouldn’t get the ashes. They offered my brother her collar and me a toy that we bought her but never used because she got sick right after we bought it.

  
I was really upset, both about our cat dying and the fact that my parents didn’t include me in any part of the process. I worked all weekend (literally all weekend - noon Friday to about 9pm Sunday with no break except driving). Monday afternoon I called the vet and asked if there was any way we could get the ashes. They had me call the crematorium, who said that they hadn’t cremated her yet and they could change it to a private cremation (just her and we would get the ashes) if the vet called them to authorize it. So I called the vet back, asked them to change it, and paid the difference between the simple and private cremation ($275). I got home Monday night and told them what I did and that I paid the difference so that we could have the cat’s ashes as a keepsake. I did it because I was really torn up about her dying and didn’t really get a chance to process it before I had to run to work, and quite frankly, I’ve been working nonstop since I found out she died, except for when I’ve been sleeping.

My parents were mad that I went behind their back and decided to get the ashes after they chose the simple cremation. I think that it was the right decision, it was something that I needed to start moving through my grief and I paid my own money.

62,1ch4fif,AITA for buying Persona 4 Golden for my son?,"I (M39) bought my son (15) Persona 4 Golden. To begin with, my son is very bright. He's on the autism spectrum, and excels in school. Over the last year. we've heard nothing but greatness from his district. He's gotten honor roll every single quarter (except the last, but we could probably bet on that) and has great attendance. Now, my son is a big fan of video games. Not to say he's a hermit or anything, in fact, he often goes out to hang out with his friends, but when he's not outside, he's playing video games. Additionally, he hasn't had any kind of outburst all year, at least not one big enough to warrant a call.

To reward this, I'd figure I'd buy him a video game. Here's where the issue comes in. My wife (36) was okay with this, and it came out of my money. The problem with that, is that I never stated what game I wanted to buy him. I remember playing Persona 4 when I was younger around my college days. It was a great game, as any Persona or Shin Megami Tensei game is, and I loved the Golden remake when I played it. So, to reward him, I decided to buy him Persona 4 Golden for his Nintendo Switch.

My wife was slightly peeved about this. After all, I know there is a little bit of content that can be disturbing, like murder and two sexual dungeons.

Admittedly, I could have bought him a different game. I know he's played the Harvest Moon games on our Wii, and he enjoyed them too. I didn't buy Persona 3 Reload or Persona 5 Royal because Reload is very expensive right now, and well... there's a bit too much fanservice in Persona 5 Royal, not to mention Kamoshida's entire dungeon.

Should I have bought him Persona 4 Golden, or am I in the wrong?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-30,"AITA for buying Persona 4 Golden for my son? I (M39) bought my son (15) Persona 4 Golden. To begin with, my son is very bright. He's on the autism spectrum, and excels in school. Over the last year. we've heard nothing but greatness from his district. He's gotten honor roll every single quarter (except the last, but we could probably bet on that) and has great attendance. Now, my son is a big fan of video games. Not to say he's a hermit or anything, in fact, he often goes out to hang out with his friends, but when he's not outside, he's playing video games. Additionally, he hasn't had any kind of outburst all year, at least not one big enough to warrant a call.

To reward this, I'd figure I'd buy him a video game. Here's where the issue comes in. My wife (36) was okay with this, and it came out of my money. The problem with that, is that I never stated what game I wanted to buy him. I remember playing Persona 4 when I was younger around my college days. It was a great game, as any Persona or Shin Megami Tensei game is, and I loved the Golden remake when I played it. So, to reward him, I decided to buy him Persona 4 Golden for his Nintendo Switch.

My wife was slightly peeved about this. After all, I know there is a little bit of content that can be disturbing, like murder and two sexual dungeons.

63,1ch4ekw,AITA for wanting to be alone with my dog the day she is put to sleep?,"Hi. My (25F) dog (18F) is as you can tell, very old. The doctor believes she may have another tumor, but in her brain this time, as she's lost a lot of cognitive fiction. She's always sleeping and very confused and just isn't..happy anymore.
Well, I decided it was most likely time, and I've made the gut wrenching decision to have her put to sleep. I hate watching her fall over and hit her head multiple times a day.

Where I may be ta is because my uncle, I'll call him Gav, previously said he would be happy to help pay for costs. The total for the full service will come to $700, so I reached out to ask if he was still willing to help. I told him that I chose an at home service where my dog can be at home with me, and that I would like to go through the process alone. (I plan to have a see you later party, beforehand.) And explained that if he couldn't, that was completely okay.

Gav proceeded to say the following;
""That is selfish. And death is as hard as we make it. What you need to keep in mind regardless of your emotions that initially she was brought in as a family member not as yours. And if you can't see past that then that is your issue. Everyone else has just as much right as you.""

It hurt to be called selfish for my decision, but I admit that maybe it is. However, being surrounded by people while my baby girl dies in my arms would no doubt give me a meltdown.

To clarify on some things, my dog was given to ME as a gift when I was 7 years old by my late grandmother. She did become to be known as the family dog, but ultimately she is mine. Gav, even on multiple occasions told me that she was not his dog, that he would not take care of her and that she was my responsibility not his, after my grandmother's passed away. Which I understood and after my great grandmother passed away in 2017, I became her soul caretaker. (She used to feed her in the morning and I would feed her at night ect. Gav lived with us and i continued to live with him after until i moved out with my dog). I was okay with this because she's my baby girl.

Is she only the family dog to him when she's dying and not when it came to feeding her? Letting her outside? I don't know. Maybe I'm too absorbed in my own grief. So Aita?

65,1ch45nl,AITA for laughing at my sister for losing a debate and saying she needed to be humbled?,"Have made this as a throwaway account because some of my family follows my Reddit.

My (F18) younger sister, Maddie (16), is both incredibly smart and incredibly confident. I do well at school myself, but Maddie has always excelled, and I'm admittedly a little envious of her ability at school. My parents praise her constantly, and I think it's given her the idea that she really is perfect. For example, whenever she gets 100% or close to it in a test, she comes home and says things like ""look who smashed it again, me"", ""it's just too easy for some"", ""I feel bad for anyone who isn't naturally gifted"". It's pretty corny and I roll my eyes over it, but my parents join in and agree with her, so I've learned to just ignore it.

Maddie has always been involved in debating at school, and she usually does very well. Again, I'd say there's an air of arrogance there, and when another student lost one time, I saw her give them a sarcastic little wave. No one else seems to pick up on it, and I feel there's a ""butter wouldn't melt in her mouth"" element to it. She's confident and does well, so I guess everyone overlooks her sort of negatives to her character.

Well, yesterday, Maddie had a debate. She'd prepared for it and in the morning over breakfast, she was doing her usual spiel about how she was going to ""crush it"", she ""wished they would give her someone good to debate against"" and all the rest. However, a new student ended up entering, and they beat Maddie. They were very impressive, and I could tell my parents and teachers were surprised.

When Maddie was in the car on the way home, she was upset and saying how ""unfair"" it was and how hard she worked. My parents were supporting her, saying she'd win next time and all the rest. I laughed, and she asked what she was so funny. I just replied that perhaps she was overconfident and it was good she lost because she needed humbling. Maddie and my parents both started shouting at me after this, telling me how unhelpful and unsupportive I was being.

When we got home, I thought that was that, but my parents told me to keep my opinions to myself and that was of no benefit to anyone. I told them that she wouldn't always win in life and learning to be gracious in defeat is a positive quality. Maddie overheard this and called me jealous, and I just exited the conversation.

66,1ch3q9f,AITA for agreeing to give a girl a ride and then refusing once she mentioned her dog?,"**Throwaway**

I (M18) had a decent relationship with this girl, Zoey (F18), who lives next door to me at my residence. She's next door to my roommate and we have a few classes together. While we get along most of the time, I’ll admit, that Zoey can at times be a bit annoying and many people have recognized that she especially does this with me lol.

After winter break, Zoey came back to school with this ugly little puppy named Chewy, which she claimed as her new “emotional support dog”. Zoey takes Chewy everywhere with her including classes and sometimes even dining area of our residence. This last part is pretty gross, but Zoey always insists that Chewy isn’t bothering anyone.

Ngl, Chewy is pretty annoying. For example, the second week he was here, he ran in front of my dorm room and took a shit. Another time, Zoey let Chewy shake himself all over me and another person in the elevator after He had come inside from playing in the rain. He also stole my roommate’s shoes several times. Not only that, Chewy always makes weird noises in the dead of night. Whenever my roommate or I mention it to Zoey, she repeats “But he’s a baby”. Pretty sure he hates me because he growls a lot around me and looks at me with suspicion from the moment he was here.

The worst thing about Chewy is that he loves to shit. I’m not joking when I say he literally poops at least 6 times every day. People often mention this to Zoey and she was concerned but apparently her vet says it’s normal so whatever.

On Friday, Zoey asked me if I could drop her off on my way home on Monday. I’d be done with my exams in the morning and she’d be done in the afternoon. She offered to split gas with me, so I agreed. I did so because earlier that week Zoey’s parents stopped by and took Chewy home with them so that Zoey could focus on her exams.

So imagine my shock on Sunday night when I see Zoey walking with Chewy. I honestly was so surprised to see him, I couldn’t even say anything. Zoey walked over to me and thanked me offering her a ride. She then looks at Chewy and goes “Say thank you, Chewy Uncle OP is giving us a ride”. I asked her how Chewy was here and she said that her parents brought him back on Saturday because she missed him.

At this stage, I point blankly told her that I couldn’t be giving her a ride because I didn’t want Chewy pooping in my car. Of course, Zoey wasn’t happy about that. She kept on saying things like how I promised and I wasn’t being fair to Chewy, etc. When I repeated that I couldn’t take the risk she said that I was being unbelievable and childish.

I ended up leaving on my own after my exam on yesterday and now a few people have been texting me saying I’m an asshole for abandoning Zoey on campus and that I should apologize.

Yesterday, I (21 Fem) got a choppy and slightly uneven bob done by myself because I was in the mood for a haircut. I took a picture of it and sent it to my friend, who I’ll refer to as ”Jessica” (19 Fem). Jessica is a fervent fan of the adult show “Hazbin Hotel”, so she made a reference to it by comparing my haircut to one of the characters in aforementioned show. This is the reference: “😂😂😂 You’re rocking the Lute haircut. Don’t worry about your lost arm, I have a prosthetic one for you. Here it is 🦾.” At first, I didn’t get the joke. I searched it up and found that this “Lute” character is an angel that lost her arm in a fight between heaven and hell.   
So I replied, “I don’t appreciate you making jokes that are related to my health, namely, me losing an arm.” I don’t know what in blazes I’ve said in my text that was aggravating, but Jessica started saying tons of stuff I didn’t understand, like, “HEY, THAT’S ABLEIST!!!” Or, “WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT, YOU’RE BEING TOO SENSITIVE!”   
When she said, “You’re a sensitive motherf\*\*er (she typed the actual word) and you’ll never be more than that! What’s wrong with Lute getting her arm ripped off?!”, I got enraged and typed: 

“Oh, please, you’re not going to be a jerk over me saying that I didn’t appreciate your joke, aren’t you?” No response. 

Now, whenever I see her, she seemed gloomy and depressed with her shoulders slumped, very much contrasting her usual bubbly and cheerful behavior and good posture.   
Although all I said was that I didn’t appreciate what Jessica said, I feel like that I was being a blame-shifter and that I was the villainess who provoked this second version of Jessica.

Reddit, am I really the asshole? I don’t want Jessica to be stuck like this forever.

In this class, I was talking with him for parts of the class but the majority I was quiet. Just to clarify, I was speaking at a normal level. There was also another friend who was talking to the teacher too. However during this class I noticed two close friends acting really passive aggressive and unlike themselves. 

It wasn’t just this class though. In our next class they were being petty about it as well bringing it up too saying that they couldn’t get any work done and wanted their AirPods because I was being so loud.

This teacher is known for being chatty as well and it is common to talk across the room. He is the one who commonly initiates conversation too. We were given an assignment and it was due at 3:00 and our class is in the morning. 

In this class, I was talking with him for parts of the class but the majority I was quiet. Just to clarify, I was speaking at a normal level. There was also another friend who was talking to the teacher too. However during this class I noticed two close friends acting really passive aggressive and unlike themselves. 

It wasn’t just this class though. In our next class they were being petty about it as well bringing it up too saying that they couldn’t get any work done and wanted their AirPods because I was being so loud. However this was not our final assignment and we had done it already although it was graded. They however had the option to wear headphones and they were not involved in the conversation either.

70,1ch38aw,AITA for getting into an argument with my friend over the movie Moana,"I was in my 5th period class when Moana’s powers were brought up. I was under the impression that the ocean was a completely different entity, one that Moana hod no power over. But my friend said that she read an article written by “Disney employees” that talked about how she and the water was connected, therefore Moana could actually control the water at her whim. I immediately started trying to prove this wrong by offering up both Google and clips from the actual movie. 
Google says that the water spirit acts as a friend, and that Moana cannot actually control it. She has the ability to talk to the water and ask it to do things, but the water doesn’t need to comply. My friend said that Google could be changed by anyone so the fact that it said that didn’t mean anything. I decided to just let that one go. 
When I showed her the clips I used the ones where she was about to drown, where she asked the water for help with finding Maui, and when she asked the water to part to allow Te Ka to come to her. If she was able to control the water, why not create an air bubble to keep herself from drowning as she tried to break her foot out from under the coral? Why would she need to ask the ocean to help her if she could just do it herself and why would she knock herself out? Why not part the water herself? 
The movie makes it extremely clear from the very beginning that the ocean is a separate entity that has its own thoughts and can make its own decisions. Wouldn’t she just be high fiveing herself after Maui was stabbed with the blow dart? 
Despite all the proof I gave her, she still refused to believe that that it wasn’t Moana controlling the water. Moana’s power is to talk with the ocean, not to control it. Three of my other friends also agreed with me that Moana had no power over the ocean but she still didn’t believe us. 
By this point, we had been arguing so long that we were at lunch and we were both yelling at each other. This continued until she snapped and told me that, that was what she believed and I should mind my own business, and to keep my mouth shut if I didn’t agree with it. That basically ended the argument but me being petty, I couldn’t leave well enough alone and had to have the stupid last word. I said, “Fine, believe what you want to believe, I know what’s fact. Sorry, but it’s like arguing with a flat earther.”

71,1ch32dg,AITA for leaving a gap at the squat rack ,"This is definitely not as heavy as some of the stuff on here but I've been agonising over it so here goes...

I went to the gym today, I saw a guy there that I usually stand and chat with when we see each other. 
There are 5 squat racks at my gym. The first 2 were taken and he was in the middle one. The last 2 were vacant.
Now to preface this, I hate having people either side of me when I am working out and unless i have no choice, I always use a rack at either end, it's just me.
We had our usual conversation and I went over to the end rack.
He looked almost sad that I hadn't used the rack next to him. 
All I could blurt out is that for me it's like urinals, I'll always default to an end one before being in between people!

Was I an asshole here or am I overthinking something yet again?

72,1ch2y1b,AITA for offering to pay my fiancé to be a SAHM & student?,"My (29M) fiancé (24F) & I recently became engaged. My fiancé has had custody of her youngest two siblings (10M & 7F) for the last 3 years and it's looking like we will be officially adopting them after we are married. 

We've obviously been talking about our future together a lot and we've specifically discussed her going back to school at some point. She currently works 30 hours a week at a job she doesn't really like that is only paying her slightly above minimum wage. I recently started a new job and will be making slightly above 110K a year after taxes. I also have a lot of savings and bought my first home a year ago. I am currently very comfortable financially. 

I told my fiancé if she didn't want to continue working I would happily be the main breadwinner. This would give her time to finish her degree and spend more time with her siblings. We also both agree on trying for a baby within the next couple of years. 

Fiancé is interested in the idea but is fearful on becoming financially dependent on me. To offset these fears we've been further discussing how to organize our finances post-wedding. 

Obviously we are going to open a joint bank account with the majority of my salary going into it and I'm going to add her to the house title. I'd be the sole person paying into the joint bank account but it would be used for all shared expenses. However, I also wanted to pay part of my salary into her own account for her own spending. She recently also opened a savings account (after months of me begging her too) and I'd want to pay a monthly amount of money into that as well. I've also been looking into a spousal IRA and opening savings accounts for fiancés siblings.  

My fiancé doesn't like how I laid this out for her and feels like I'd be paying her to be a housewife. I don't really know how other single income couples organize their finances. To me, this plan should placate some of her fears as the majority of the money would be shared, she'd have her own seperate funds for her own things, and she'd have savings of her own if we ever divorced. 

A couple of her friends have even said that me paying money into her account equals me trying to own her. These friends are really making her question my motives and now she's accusing this strategy as being controlling when I was trying to do the opposite.

73,1ch2rpy,WIBTA for not getting help,"i (23 now) struggled with alcohol in my college years as many do and have since reduced my drinking significantly after having a talk with my sister while i lived with her post-college. she's my closest family at the moment as my parents and i haven't been close in years.  
  
bit of background, in college i met my best friends whom i lived with in an apartment for 2 years, and we would regularly go out for drinks or have cozy nights in with a few shots. during this time, i'll admit that i struggled with my alcohol intake and knowing when to stop myself as i was very inexperienced with alcohol, blacking out a few timesbefore getting my act together and knowing my limits.  
  
my sister graciously allowed me to move in with her after college due to my tenuous relationship with my parents and after some rough patches, we talked about my drinking and i limited myself in it.  
  
my parents never really talked to me about this, only mentioning it in passing.  
  
my sister ended up not renewing her lease and i moved back in with my parents while i got back into schooling (extra classes to bump up my resume). all they asked was that i watch my alcohol intake and not eat in my room. i accepted.  
  
turns out that while we were moving my stuff in, they went through all my drawers and packed boxes, awkwardness ensued as many of the items were personal and my diary lock combo was messed with.

i asked what he meant and he motioned to the containers and said, ""either you go to rehab or you're out of the house.""  
  
i asked if it mattered how long it took me to drink them or how often i drank and he said no, any amount was bad. he also said that i wasn't allowed to finish my schooling or get new work until i went. none of the rehab centers have agreed to take me yet, as i pass their breathalyzer and piss tests easily and my drinking habits aren't ""excessive"".

He went on to tell me that I don’t know what it’s like to be poor— me and him, by all accounts have both grown up solidly middle class: i’ve been to his house in the suburbs, I’m aware of what his parents do for work, and I sustain that it would be foolish to say he is poor. 
When I tried to explain this to him with a degree of hesitation and understanding, he immediately told me I was the same as every other white person, and I would never understand what it was like to be him. I knew he experienced different things than me, but I was looking at basic financial ability, it wasn’t about how hard one’s life was, it was about contributing equally when you have equal means. 

He told me I was entitled and ended our friendship there.

79,1ch14s8,AITA For telling my wife to never volunteer me to help her family again,"My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 8 years and have a 4-year-old son.  My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together.

A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.  

This turned into an argument between us because she said I should help them move while she watches our son since I'm stronger than she is and I know how to drive our truck with a trailer.  I told her that she should help them and have them rent a U-Haul for the day.  We ""compromised"" by telling Joe that I would help them but they need to get a U-Haul instead of using our truck and trailer. 

Then, the morning of the move (this past Saturday), my wife told me that a friend of hers got suite tickets through work to a hockey game for that day and invited them.  Yes, suite tickets to a playoff hockey game.  She said she would be bringing our son since her friend was bringing her kids too.  

Great, so not only do I get stuck helping someone move, but my wife and son get to go have an amazing experience together that I miss out on.  And yes, this was my son's first major sporting event and I was missing it.  

And wouldn't you know it, Joe never got a U-Haul.  And his GF wasn't even close to packed up and ready when I got there.  I spent 7-8 hours and multiple trips back and forth helping them move.  All the while my wife is sending pictures to our family group chat of how much fun they're having at the hockey game.  

When everyone was home that night, my wife was surprised that I wasn't in a good mood.  She said that I acted like I barely cared when our son was telling us about the hockey game and how much fun it was.  I asked her if she was seriously confused about why I was upset and she told me to tell her.  

So, I started railing off all the reasons I had to be pissed off.  She volunteered me to help, she got to spend the day doing something very special with our son that I missed out on, her brother and his GF were not prepared, and I had spent the entire day doing manual labor.  I ended my little rant by telling her that she is never going to volunteer me to help her family ever again.  

She told me I was overreacting and I can't hold it against her that her friend invited them to the game. She also said I'm not being fair by blaming her for Joe and his GF.

80,1ch0lz0,AITAH for inviting my friends friend to go shopping with me?,"I (20f) live with my best friend (20f) named Eliza. Recently Eliza’s other friend (21f) Kennedy started asking to hang out with us and do some school work/studying at cafes or the library.  Eliza doesn’t really like Kennedy that much, she always seems kind of annoyed when we’re with her and, I can definitely understand why, Kennedys personality is very different from Eliza’s and I think Kennedy just kind of drains her social battery really fast. Kennedy and I have never hung out on our own though. 

Well I recently broke up with my long term boyfriend and wanted to spend extra time with friends to help and I just think it would be good for me. I asked Eliza if she’d care if I asked Kennedy to go shopping with me sometime (as I really don’t have that many friends that are available to hang out with often, one of my friends moved out of state and another one has a baby so she is busy all the time). Eliza said she didn’t care so I sent her a text. 

Well apparently Eliza DOES care and she seemed to get upset when she found out we actually made plans to hang out. She said she “didn’t even get an invite”, was kidding when she said it was ok for me to ask Kennedy and canceled OUR plans to go to the mall today and told me to just go with Kennedy instead. I tried to remedy the situation by telling her that of course I still wanted to go with her! She’s super fun to hang out with and I even told her it would make hanging out with Kennedy even more fun if she came too! But she said no, she didn’t want to go, and she doesn’t want to go with just me anymore either.

This is all pretty distressing for me, I just lost my boyfriend of 2.5 years and now I feel like my best friend is mad at me and doesn’t want to hang out with me either. I feel so lonely but I also feel like I can’t even hang out with Kennedy either or Eliza will be upset. I also feel guilt for potentially making Eliza feel left out but Eliza doesn’t even like Kennedy that much, I really didn’t think she’d care.

81,1cgzgu8,WIBTA for not going to my cousins wedding?,"I (17F) along with my family was invited to a wedding for my cousin (i’ll refer to him as cousin for privacy reasons) and his fiancé. They live a state away, and we would be gone for 4 days. My boyfriend (very recent, we’ve been talking for 2 ish months, but been really good friends for a little over a year) is turning 18 the day I’m supposed to leave for the wedding. This is on a Friday, and he wanted to plan stuff all weekend for his birthday. 

My parents don’t know we’re together for a few reasons we agreed upon, but they do know we hang out pretty much every day and have for the last ~6 months. I told my parents that it was his birthday that day and asked if I could miss the wedding to stay for his birthday. They told me that they won’t force me to go but that this would be (hopefully) his only wedding and that my boyfriend will have many more birthdays.

 My opinion on it is, I’m not even very close with this cousin in the first place. He lives in another state and we only see each other once every few years. He’s also significantly older than me and he’s pretty cool but I wouldn’t consider us to be “close” at all. I have him added on facebook but we’ve never talked outside of the times my family visits. It’s also my boyfriends 18th birthday which in my opinion is a special birthday and I really wanted to be there with him. He said he wants me to stay for his birthday but he’s not gonna try and convince me not to go and that we could plan more stuff to do when I get back. I considered this but that would mean I’d still miss the party my friends will throw for him and probably other stuff too.

My problem is, both my older siblings have been telling me I’m selfish for not wanting to go, and that a wedding is more important than my friends birthday (they also don’t know about our relationship.) I’m torn on what to do. My boyfriend is telling me I should go so I don’t upset my family, but I can tell he wants me here. I much rather would be here for his birthday than the wedding.

86,1cgxodx,AITAH For telling my boyfriend to stop being a mama's boy,"Sorry for my broken English, it's not my primary language but I know basic grammar and spelling. 

For some context, I(23F) am with my boyfriend (24M) James, for a little over 3 years now. Started dating during the pandemic when I was in my 1st year in college and he was in his 2nd year. Now, I'm still in my third year and he graduated a year ago. I currently don't have a job or any source of income at the moment, so does he. I do some freelance on the side to get by for my wants, and sometimes his. Oh, and by the way, we don't live together. I still live with my grandma and he lives with his parents. 

The thing is, a few months back, James was supposed to start a job that his mom and his mom's friend offered him to do. I don't know what exactly the job is, but he was telling me how good the pay is. Of course, I was excited for him as he was to start earning for himself. Time to time I kept asking James about his job , and he would always tell me that he only needed to finish this task and he would start working. Well, a few months went by and still nothing. James now would keep on complaining about how he doesn't have money and is to broke to give me anything. I told him that maybe he should start working for a part-time job.

For some context, I(23F) am with my boyfriend (24M) James, for a little over 3 years now. Started dating during the pandemic when I was in my 1st year in college and he was in his 2nd year. Now, I'm still in my third year and he graduated a year ago. I currently don't have a job or any source of income at the moment, so does he. I do some freelance on the side to get by for my wants, and sometimes his. Oh, and by the way, we don't live together. I still live with my grandma and he lives with his parents. 

The thing is, a few months back, James was supposed to start a job that his mom and his mom's friend offered him to do. I don't know what exactly the job is, but he was telling me how good the pay is. Of course, I was excited for him as he was to start earning for himself. Time to time I kept asking James about his job , and he would always tell me that he only needed to finish this task and he would start working. Well, a few months went by and still nothing. James now would keep on complaining about how he doesn't have money and is to broke to give me anything. I told him that maybe he should start working for a part-time job.

She pretty much ticks all the boxes for a covert narcissist however she has never been diagnosed officially (since she refuses to see anyone) and I know how hard it is to diagnose NPD in any case but I truly believe she has covert NPD. 

My Dad and I have become closer emotionally over how she is and we would talk a lot about it and things she does. My dad would confide in me a lot and still does. We have each other is what I mean.

Now I’m 18 and realise she will never ever change. About 7 months ago my view of my mom completely changed just naturally and I am done with her behaviour and how she treats people.

Today, I said to my Dad that he should leave her and that she doesn’t care and never will. I was definitely harsh and agressive I think (because I’m so angry myself with how my mom has treated me as well). He looked like he was going to cry and left for the gym.  I feel horrible now and I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do at all. He said we’ll talk more about it when he gets back. I know he still loves her so much.

91,1cgx2b5,AITA for joking with my best friend till he believed i hated him?,"(throwaway account because i'm kind of embarrassed)

I (20M) am in a friendgroup with my best friend (22M) (lets call him M), we are both in the same college but have known each other way before that. It all started when one time our friendgroup got kind of bored by the typical drinking games,  card games etc so we decided to write assumptions of each other on paper, mix them up in a cap and then you either held up a circle (agree) or crossed your fingers (disagree) about each assumption that was read. Honestly it was a pretty funny game until one question was read out loud that threw me for a loop; Does \[me\] hate M?

Now I was thrown in a total loop, it felt like total whiplash, and in our friendgroup we use the term hate pretty loosely for comedic effect but the question still rubbed me the wrong way. Even as I kept protesting and saying i dont almost everyone held up a circle, including M. It kinda hurt a lot, and I got very embarrassed that even one of my best friends (m, that is) was agreeing with the dumbass assumption that I kind of exploded on him right then and there. 

I didn't yell or cuss or anything, but I was very distraught over it because seriously? Why would you think that? M laughed it off awkwardly and kinda got away saying he needed to go the bathroom because he's the kind to never do good with confrontation 

I was still obviously upset by it, and some were starting to feel awkward over the tension and just migrated in different parts of the apartment (lol). But then another best friend of mine kinda jokingly snapped at me and said ""what did you think M would think?"" and then listed all the...jokes I've been playing on him since we've known each other, and how I used to act. Basically I always joke about his height (hes shorter than me lol), and would pick him last in games, and tease him because he's very fun and cute to tease, and just typical teasing between two guys yk. He's also a very affectionate guy, he's the type to kiss you on the cheek as a greeting and casually cuddle up to somebody, so combine that with me who doesn't know what to do with that kind of affection...well, I don't know. Every time he would get close or jokingly try and kiss me I would push him away or run off because I would feel too flustered (i'm a very shy guy, but M never made me uncomfortable). 

I'm not saying i'm the most mature person on earth, I know that but I didn't think he would (even just a little bit) start thinking i *hate* him, or find him annoying. Our other best friend said how I should've known since M is a very sensitive guy (he had an intense period where he struggled with an ED, it still kinda lingers). It makes me think of how i've noticed he's pulled back a bit recently, not being as clingy as he used to with me and I wonder if its bcs of me.

Despite the awkward tension, we bounced back pretty quick because M is just like that, forgiving and extremely nice, and thats exactly why it's still on my mind and why i feel so guilty.

It delayed the divorce so they had been separated for more than two years and the separation started when Tommy learned Marla had cheated. We found out about the stealing after (and she stole from us after the separation). All in all Marla stole close to 35k between us all.

My husband and I went to court and were awarded very generous grandparents visitation under grandparents rights of our state. Marla was furious. She tried to appeal but it was rejected twice. The relationship between us was not civil. So we kept it simply and only communicated times for pick up, dates were already specified. 

Marla remarried and now has additional children. Marla has asked a few times for us to include her other children. We ignore the requests.

My friend who I have not known very long asked me to be in the wedding. I am absolutely gutted but I don’t know how to tell them their partner is dodgy. If I say anything, I don’t want them to think I do not support their lgbtq lifestyle, but it is not about that at all, their partner simply is terrible. 

The wedding is coming, and one of the other friends in the wedding party and I have had a chat. we are not sure if it is our place to say anything considering how little time we have known our friend, but it is apparent that they need to end it with their partner and are blind to the problems or maybe ignoring them, but we can see from the outside that it’s toxic and rough to watch. We think that as friends it would be best to try to stop our friend from having to get divorced in the future, but we fear that we will alienate them and cause more unforeseeable problems.

My friends family is not approving according to their brother and just getting along with it, and the partners family is just chuffed to see their child supported by their partner

It is clear that their partner is extremely immature whiny and infantile for being much older than my friend, does not pay for any part of their share of anything, and has seemed to wiggle out of all responsibility (like quitting work and letting my friend pay for everything) as soon as they noticed that my friend would take the lead on every aspect of their lives from every small detail you can imagine- from meals to paying bills to appointments to going to the market doing their school getting general things done and I see my friend running in circles, their light has left, they have lost themselves taking care of their fully able partner. And when I say my friend does everything for them... bloody hell…  

We have seen many times My friend’s partner wont do the simplest thing for them, and we watched our friend laugh it off after having their messages read and calls ignored by the lazy bones partner... I am trying to be vague on examples but the specifics of how little the partner does for the friend would astonish any old bloke 

We recently met some of our friend's old friends from uni who are also in the wedding party at their shower, and even more red flags came out. Our friend is an outstanding human being and deserves a better life than this

I really don't think our friend would cancel the wedding this close for many reasons, but it is hard to watch them make the biggest mistake of their life and not try to warn them. My family advised me to not say anything as people must make their own choices, but I don't think they understand the depth of it

Should we tell our friend and risk losing them?

My friend who I have not known very long asked me to be in the wedding. I am absolutely gutted but I don’t know how to tell them their partner is dodgy. If I say anything, I don’t want them to think I do not support their lgbtq lifestyle, but it is not about that at all, their partner simply is terrible. 

The wedding is coming, and one of the other friends in the wedding party and I have had a chat. we are not sure if it is our place to say anything considering how little time we have known our friend, but it is apparent that they need to end it with their partner and are blind to the problems or maybe ignoring them, but we can see from the outside that it’s toxic and rough to watch.

95,1cgwp29,AITA for not wanting to invite all my fiance's groomsmens girlfriends to my Bachelorette party?,"My fiancé and I are planning our separate bridal parties for our wedding. We will have the parties the same weekend but at separate locations at least 2 nights as of right now. I have 3 bridesmaids and 1 maid of honor. He has the same,  3 groomsman and 1 best man

 One of his groomsmen (Matt) is coming from quite a few states away from us, so him and his long term girlfriend (Hanna) will be flying here together a few weeks before the wedding and staying with us until the wedding day. With that being said, ONE of his groomsmen's (Matt) girlfriend Hanna is invited to my Bachelorette party because we don't want her staying at our house alone while they visit as we will be gone for multiple days and I feel it's the right thing to do as she is both of our friends as well. 

I had one of the other groomsmen (Eric) confront me out of the blue in person asking me to invite his fairly new girlfriend to my Bachelorette party. I have nothing against Eric's girlfriend I just feel if I included her as well the rest of the guys would expect me to bring their s/o which I really don't want to do. I am not asking my financé to invite any of my girls s/o. I feel a little jaded in the fact my fiancé agreeing with his groomsmen and just telling them to ask me which puts me on the spot, but I do appreciate him not telling them yes on my behalf.

A few things to note:
 Our parties are still months away and it's all in a rough draft stage, with general ideas for each party.
 We trying our best to be ""budget friendly"" so less people means less hotel rooms/ needing a bigger air bnb and a more intimate and personal connection at each of our parties.
 I'm a very antisocial person and the girl friends I do have are all very close friends of mine and I'm not an open person upfront to newer people and I don't want it to strain against Eric's girlfriend if she were to come. I would just feel awkward and out of place at my own party, especially if it was all the guys girlfriends that I don't really know that well. 
 I may have a little bit of bias towards Eric's girlfriend because I've seen and heard some things that shows she has some kind of interest in my fiancé (more than friends) even her boyfriend has seen it and we have discussed it but everything is civil as a whole. I'm not as worried about anything happening in that sense but more of I don't want to be around it if I don't feel obligated to be. 

Would I be the asshole saying no to Eric's girlfriend but allowing matt's girlfriend from out of state to join our bachelorette while shes staying in town?

97,1cgw32c,AITA for telling my dying father I will not be cleaning up his mess? ,"On a throwaway because not a lot of people know about this ugly story. 

My dad had affairs, but one of the women got pregnant. He managed to keep this a secret for a couple of years but the AP told my mom and all hell broke loose. Parents split up, my dad was excommunicated from his own family. His life went to complete shit because as you can imagine he’s not the most emotionally stable individual. 

He tried to keep a relationship with me (I was 10 by the time my parents split and he moved in with AP) but I wasn’t stupid so I figured out what kind of person he was and wanted nothing to do with that whole household. He fought for joint custody and tried therapy for him and me, until I was 13 and I ran away from home to avoid going to his house on the weekend (made it to another country actually lol). That was when he gave up making me visit. 

We were extremely LC until about a year ago, when I found out via one of my aunts that he’s dying (liver disease). I got back in contact to have some closure. It’s been 4 months, and I honestly feel like a weight has been lifted. I’ve made my peace with everything as far as I’m concerned. I’ve been helping out with a lot of medical costs to keep him as comfortable as possible. I’ve never had any contact with AP or their kids (I’ve bumped into her once at the hospital and flat out ignored her). 

A few days ago I was visiting my dad at his palliative care facility and he brought up that he would like me to talk to the extended family about letting AP and the kids have contact. He said they would listen if it came from me because I was the one was affected by his poor choices and he just wanted the kids to have family (AP doesn’t have any). I said absolutely not, I will not clean up his mess for him, that just because I’ve accepted his mistakes that doesn’t mean I want to see them every year at Christmas, if the rest of the family want to reach out that’s up to them but I won’t pretend it’s what I want. He seemed hurt but hasn’t brought it up again. 

I know the kids will be left with nothing when he goes. His medical insurance is from his job but I’m covering a lot of the shortfall, and I’ve been handling a lot of his paperwork, I know he’s broke. They will lose their house when he goes. A family connection would help. But then again, I don’t think I owe it to him to lie to everyone and say I’m fine with them being part of things when I’m not. If they started going to events I’d stop. I want nothing to do with these people.

There’s actually a chance she will see this so please be respectful if you comment. I 22F had my actual birthday pass this past weekend, though I spent my birthday out of town for a formal event unrelated to my birthday. Obviously, people still wished me happy birthday and stuff, but I decided to plan my bday party for next weekend so that I could actually have plans unrelated to the event. This is important context, because my friends bday is the week after my party. 
Our birthdays are almost exactly 2 weeks apart. I tried to plan my party for the weekend before, but because of issues with the party bus, I have to have it a week later than my bday. 
My friend 21F did not want to attend the trip and event that happened on my actual bday (it involved a weekend of partying and she’s not super into clubbing and such) but decided to come for the one day, my bday, and drove up with her bf and his 2 friends to join us at the club. 
For some background on her bf, they get in fights a lot. She rants to us and asks for advice, but then gets mad if we say our opinion on him. Anyways, unsurprisingly to our friend group, they got into a terrible fight the night of my bday that ended in tears and an argument between me and her bf.
He says extremely cruel things to her when he’s mad at her, and especially when he’s drinking. I went home upset because I wanted to have a good time and enjoy my bday but had to comfort my friend and fight with her bf. 
Last night, me and my friend had a long conversation about her bf and how she’s sick of how he treats her, the constant fighting, etc. and I told her I don’t want him at my bday party next weekend. She understood and agreed. 
Today, however, her opinion changed. She now is saying that it is unfair that he is uninvited because she was partially to blame for the fight (they fought bc he made her upset for a valid reason and he blew it up after she voiced how she felt). 
His friend is seeing my other friend, and I’m allowing the friend to come because he was very mature the night of the fight and treats the other friend right. She’s upset about this, and that my party is a week before hers, as she feels no one cares about her birthday now. 
For context, I planned and paid for my bday party myself and with the girl I’m having the party with (another friend who i’ve been talking about having a joint bday party with since the beginning of college because our bdays are almost the same day). I told her that all of our friend group is looking forward to her bday whatever she decides to do. She’s now saying she’s not having a party or doing anything because of this and she doesn’t want to come to my party. 
She said this is the most hateful thing I could have ever done to her.

Today, however, her opinion changed. She now is saying that it is unfair that he is uninvited because she was partially to blame for the fight (they fought bc he made her upset for a valid reason and he blew it up after she voiced how she felt). 
His friend is seeing my other friend, and I’m allowing the friend to come because he was very mature the night of the fight and treats the other friend right. She’s upset about this, and that my party is a week before hers, as she feels no one cares about her birthday now. 
For context, I planned and paid for my bday party myself and with the girl I’m having the party with (another friend who i’ve been talking about having a joint bday party with since the beginning of college because our bdays are almost the same day). I told her that all of our friend group is looking forward to her bday whatever she decides to do. She’s now saying she’s not having a party or doing anything because of this and she doesn’t want to come to my party. 
She said this is the most hateful thing I could have ever done to her. I realize that there might be a lot of missing context here, but long story short, I want zero drama at my party and I have lost all respect for her bf and I don’t want him there.",0.0,0.028712891042232513,0,1
102,1cgvkhg,AITA for not wanting to listen to my friend vent?,"I’ve been friends with this girl, let’s call her Bella. Bella is an extremely sweet person that been friends with for a few years. Despite the fact that we see each other irl constantly, most of our closeness comes from texting and sending reels to each other. We grew even closer recently as she has been venting about the many struggles she had and continues to have in her life. 

I come from a culture that doesn’t encourage speaking to people, even your closest friends, about such personal things. These secrets should only stay at home, and revealing them to anyone can cause others to take advantage of you of your vulnerability or ruin your reputation. This built-in belief I have causes me to not disclose everything and anything about my personal life, and sustain boundaries between my friends and I, and generally, my very close friends that come from my same culture behave the same way. However, Bella’s struggles mostly come from her parents and their abusive nature, so venting to them isn’t exactly the brightest idea, making me her only vessel. 

Because I’ve never had a friendship like this, it’s difficult for me to feel comfortable listening to a person getting so vulnerable around me. It’s definitely a sign that she trusts me, and whenever she needs advice I try my best to give her just that, but the way I go about my problems and issues are simply not suitable for her. She is suffering, and her vents always devastate me as I feel like I am of no use to her. Although I’ve been told I’m a good listener and she constantly seeks my advice, I just always feel uncomfortable and upset whenever she vents. I am a people pleaser and I can’t get myself to express how I feel about this to her, and I feel like it will hurt her if I admit this to her.

I (39F) have been wanting to go to Paris and the Louvre since I was in high school because I love art. My husband (47M) has finally made some plans for us to go next year for our 20 year anniversary. Nothing concrete like booked flights or hotels, but he is really serious about it this time. We have traveled internationally before (we live in the US), and while Paris was always at the top of my list of destinations, we just haven’t had the chance to go. I’m excited to go with him next year. 

However, about a week ago, my mom told me that my younger brother couldn’t go on their planned trip to Paris this June, so she asked me if I wanted to go. I got super excited about the idea of going two years in a row, especially since I’ve been waiting so long. When I went home to tell my husband about my opportunity, he was devastated. He said I should not have even considered it since we are going next year. I said I wanted to go both times, but he said that if I go to Paris with my mom this June, then he would be so heartbroken that we won’t go for our anniversary next year, or ever. 

Now I’m the one who’s heartbroken because I had to turn down my mom’s offer. I tried to bring it up again with him, but he said that he wants to see my reaction the first time I see the art in the Louvre. He said he cares about seeing that kind of stuff more than me because he is more romantic than I am (which is true, I’m not very sentimental or romantic).  

I understand where he’s coming from, but I still want to go with my mom AND with him. I’m tired of waiting. Now I’m mad because I am once again putting what I want aside to keep him happy.

I told her about my vision to go travelling, but she was upset for not being included in those plans. I didn't include her in my plans because she has been living of wellfare money and only has enough to pay for her rent, so she wouldnt have enough to pay for anything at all. She got hurt for me not including her in the plans, and I understand that.  
We've been together for a couple of months now and I pay 90% of the time I'd say. But it doesn't feel healthy to me. She is currently unemployed for over a year, but has been in a senior role before. She doesn't take on a lower paid role, because she is also in debt because of het current financial status and for filing a lawsuit against her previous employer that she lost.  
I feel like I'm in such a dilemma, because I would love her to join on this trip, but honestly I want to travel for at least 6 months and I only have enough to pay for myself. Also I feel like its just weird to financially carry someone right away when starting a relationship, that just doesn't sit well with me.  
I asked her to take on a temporary job to save for our trip, but she is afraid of not getting wellfare money after the trip. Her pov seems to be that I should carry her financially, but I feel so uncomfortable with it now. I told her that the moment we move in together, that changes the situation, but right now I view my money as mine and hers as hers, but I am willing to give/share (as I am doing for the last couple of months, 90% on me).

106,1cguvaj,"AITA for telling my mom if they move back to Greece, I won’t follow?","So for context me and my family have been living in America for 10 years (which in my mom’s words is longer than they expected to be here). For the past 4 months my mom has been telling me how “dad is tired and I don’t think he will last here for another summer”. 
Anytime I talk to her this has been the topic, “you know dad is tired and he would like to move back, I can see it in his eyes” were her exact words. And because I only have one year left of school she keeps telling me to find colleges in Greece because “we will be moving”.

 I tried to not give her an answer and just smile and leave anytime she says that. I thought about it and I don’t want to move, I don’t want to leave this place. She doesn’t understand why I don’t want to move because she sees Greece as her home (which I understand, she grew up there) but I lived here for 10 years and have no memories (or good memories) of Greece anyways.
Yesterday we had a “talk” about it. She brought it up as soon as I came from school. “You know I found a good college for you in Greece it’s very close to home…” and gave me directions of how to get there (like I knew the streets). I didn’t say anything and tried to eat my food. 

“You know dad is tired and I don’t think he can do this no longer” and continued “look we can stay until you finish school and then you can go to college in Greece.” And continued “you need to think reasonable, plus it’s going to be an American college you don’t even need to know Greek.” I got tired and finally told her “I don’t want to go back, I would like to stay here instead”

 She got angry and started screaming “you understand that dad can’t keep working like this he is getting tired” I told her okay and that I still want to stay here. She told me I can’t support myself because I don’t have a job and I told her I am going to get a job this summer. 

She paused for a moment and started telling me how it’s not like I’m going to lose anything I don’t even have friends and don’t go outside so why would I want to stay here. I screamed back at her and told her “I’m not telling you to stay here, I’m not yelling at dad for being tired, I just don’t want to move!”

 She didn’t stop but got angrier and told me “and where are you going to live? You know we will sell this house right? You know how hard it is to get an apartment? You don’t even know how to cook your own food!” So at that point i just went back to eating and stoped talking, she still went on about the college and I said to her (while laughing) after that whole hour “mom can I just get some silence you have been talking for an hour. Please I’m trying to eat.” Then finally she just went on talking about the show on the tv. 

Not gonna lie that conversation exhausted me so back I immediately fell asleep at like 5pm until it was morning. But moving back to that place is not an option, i don’t hate it but i don’t love it either. I just hope she stops talking about it.

107,1cguumj,AITA for refusing to do chores as long as my brother doesn't contribute,"I (19F) am currently staying at my parents while studying for my finals as well as entrance exams. I am currently waking up at 7am and immediately start studying with only a one-hour break until 9pm, which is when I get to call my boyfriend. It's 13 hours of straight studying, and it's definitely exhausting, but I will get a one-week break in 2 months right before starting my summer job. 

My (17M) brother does not study, does not have a job, and just plays video games from the moment he gets home at 3pm until the moment he goes to bed. He also has his own weekends. My brother is very talented at doing this thing commonly known as “weaponized incompetence”. He will purposefully fuck up very simple tasks in order to not have to do them next time, and I even suspect he's  punishing our parents for daring to give him chores. The most egregious example we've seen recently is when he poured bleach in the washing machine and pretended he didn't know the difference between bleach and laundry detergent. 

&#x200B;

So, when it comes to chores, my parents rely on me. It goes from cooking and grocery shopping to laundry and deep cleaning the house on weekends. I don't mind doing a few chores, but it's taking me a few hours every day. Since I'm already on a tight schedule and my studies are the priority, I have to compensate by taking time off of the few moments I have with my boyfriend or sleeping. I'm not overexaggerating, I am expected to cook full meals from scratch three times a day, grocery shop (we live in a rural area and I don't have my licence, so that's an hour and a half walk every time we need something) then to tidy, clean, and hoover a three-bedroom house. Almost every day.  

I have deadlines coming in, and already don't have time to see friends or for any of my hobbies. My entire day is just chores → studying → chores → studying → 5 hours of sleep. I'm exhausted, while my brother just sits on his ass gaming. I feel like I barely get recognition for my help, whereas he gets congratulated for showering twice a week. 

&#x200B;

Therefore, I confronted my parents a week ago. They explained that firstly, my brother was a minor, so he does not owe them as much, whereas I should feel grateful that they pay my rent at almost the age of 20. And, most importantly, that he is so incompetent that “explaining a task to him just takes more time than just doing it yourself, not to mention having to clean up the aftermath, why bother?”.

I'm convinced my brother is being dense on purpose. There is no way a 17-year-old does not know how to cook pasta or that you have to put frozen food away in the freezer because if you leave it out in the open it's just going to melt. And so I just told my parents that I would stop helping them out as long as he did not pull his weight in. I think I was almost immediately called ungrateful and childish.

109,1cgu4ll,AITAH Not Seeing MIL for Mother’s Day ,"As I get closer to 40, I find it almost unbearable to do things for people based on duty or obligation alone. 

Context: My SO and I have been together for 14 years. My own mom passed in 2015 and my Dad has emotionally distanced himself from my brother (who lives across the country) and myself. He booked multiple cruises this last round of holidays. I have no kids. 

The issue that might make me an unintentional asshole: My MIL is upset that I have other plans on Mother’s Day. For the past few years I’ve made minimal effort to show up for holidays or her birthday. She got mad this past Easter when we only showed up to eat. I realize now it seemed rude to her. I was supposed to come early and help her cook. That was the expectation. I want her to realize I’m not interested in performing social roles or niceties just because.

When we arrived and I asked her how I could help, she looked at her boyfriend with a knowing side eye and said something about it being too late for that. I have chronic pain and fatigue and would’ve been happy with nothing/anything. She has a new boyfriend, so I assumed he would help her at the house. Whoops. 

With regards to Mother’s Day…my mom passed in 2015 and I like to spend the day how I choose. I’ve known my MIL for 14 years and we get along but are not close. I knew her when my mom passed and she’s never mentioned my mom since. She’s never asked me about myself. Who she thinks I am is based only on our interactions together. She doesn’t know my birthday. 

She’s not an outwardly manipulative person, and I’m not a doctor, but I suspect some level of narcissism. My SO is accepting of my choice and I love him for giving me freedom of choice for how and when I interact with his mom. He is loyal to his mom and will always look out for her. She wasn’t the best mom to him, but he overlooks and forgives because she’s the only family he has. I know he wants us all to be one happy family, but I’m just not willing at this point in my life to entertain someone else out of a sense of duty.

Context: My SO and I have been together for 14 years. My own mom passed in 2015 and my Dad has emotionally distanced himself from my brother (who lives across the country) and myself. He booked multiple cruises this last round of holidays. I have no kids. 

The issue that might make me an unintentional asshole: My MIL is upset that I have other plans on Mother’s Day. For the past few years I’ve made minimal effort to show up for holidays or her birthday. She got mad this past Easter when we only showed up to eat. I realize now it seemed rude to her.

Where I live corruption is rampant and that frustrates the crap out of me. I get people as classmates who have no business with electrical engineering. Cheating is a big thing here. 

I accused a girl that I offered electronics tutoring of cheating(different course). She and a friend of hers terrorized me to take them in because they took up a complex thesis which they knew nothing about. In the end she did cheat, by using the last year's exam. She flew into a rage when I made the allegation telling me that she was apalled by my behaviour.

The problem is that I finished the tutoring by December of 2023 and as of today I still haven't been fully paid. I only got 50%. Her friend didn't even give me a dime. For context, I charged each one 150 euros total for 6 tutoring lessons(25 euros per lesson)
I did my job and explained the concepts needed by them in their thesis work. They seemed happy. We started in September 2023 and finished in December 2023. 

I was accused of being vain, calling people who knew nothing about our field humps(this one is actually true and I admit it), and being greedy (median income in our country is 850 euros, and a good rental flat costs 300 euros).

I also have to do most of the reports in our team for 9/10 courses because she simply knows nothing. If I ask for help I get seen messages or : 'I'll figure it out"" which means I'll do nothing. She also brought a different friend of hers that does nothing. It has been like this for the past 3 years. I do have to admit that she helped me in the first year of Uni, in two classes but that's it. I offered to pay her then and there but she declined and that was it. Years 2,3 and 4 I was the main worker in our team. I pumped the reports, did the lab work and helped the others.

She confronted me today about calling the people who cheated humps. I told her it was an ugly thing to say but I admitted it and revealed my frustrations with the whole ordeal. I was called insensitive, mean, greedy and other stuff. I offered to pay her the 50% back and told her friend to simply forget about any money.

Am I the asshole for acting like this and confronting her? I talked face to face with her. Then she sent me some messages.

The problem is, we’re now two months away from moving in (we signed the lease three months ago) and suddenly the one roommate is changing her mind about me getting a puppy (she’s ok with an adult) I told her I want a Swiss doodle which can be a very calm and highly intelligent and well trained breed. 

I should note as well that I very much want a rescue and an older dog however my mom is severely allergenic and I need a breed that accommodates (Swiss doodles are hypoallergenic), which my roommate is aware of. Importantly, my third roommate is getting a kitten. 

She gradually made comments that told me she wasn’t ok with a puppy but I specifically noted I would like a roommate who is ok with there being an dog of any kind. She’s gone as far as telling me which breed I need to get, how old is must be, and how calm it needs to be. 

I told her I’d be willing to pay extra for training (I haven’t purchased the puppy yet) and be willing to get an older puppy so it won’t teeth but she just texted me this morning that her mom now won’t cover her college funds if I don’t get an adult dog because it won’t be well trained.

It’s worked: in a month she has lost 7 lbs and she looks even more gorgeous.

I made sure to congratulate her on her hard work but she accused me of being controlling and taking over her entire life.

I got married about 4.5 years ago, since then my wife has constantly injected herself into my friends night.. she constantly stresses over the conditions of our house (I help clean and set up everything), cooking (I usually cook something in a crockpot for everyone) I even work from home on Mondays to help make sure everything is up to her standards.. 

She asked me to cut down my friends nights, knowing she was overwhelmed I obliged and cut it to once a week, then She asked me to cut the time down from 6 hours, again I obliged, and now we only get together for about 4 hours which makes for 2-4 games of magic which is good because we can swap up the pods.

 I have 7 friends and they don’t all come every week.. since then she’s asked me to cut it to 4 people per night, I told her no and I explain that 2 pods of 4 or 3 are the best way to play and I don’t want to exclude anyone so we can switch up who plays with who. She asked me to cut it to once a month I told her no because I don’t really have any other hobbies. Now she asks for me to cut it down to every other week… 

 I spend EVERY minute of my at-home life with her, all I ask for is one night a week. Flash forward 2 years and we still have this argument almost on a weekly basis… the stress from it all makes me not want to even play anymore… 

My house isn’t the biggest but it’s the most central location where everyone can get to, and the only space big enough to accommodate all of us, otherwise we have to drive a significant distance and we don’t all get to play together. 

We now have foster children who are with us temporarily, this adds to the stress for her and I help out from the moment I get home to the moment I go to bed.. 

My wife has been unable to maintain jobs due to her disability causing us to rely on my income alone.. This causes us to have severe financial stress… 

Edit: ( to be clear this is mostly the past, I make enough money to get by just fine alone but when emergencies happen we get financially strained) and I’ve had to sell significant portions of my collection to just pay bills month to month… I’ve had to cut down to one card of each and sell my most expensive and prized items in my collection in attempts to keep us afloat.. 

I’ve tried to start other hobbies but everytime I want to invite anyone over it’s an argument and there is always an excuse for why I can’t… every time I want to go out and do something else alone, again argument and more stress.. 

So AITA for trying to hold onto the one night per week I can actually do something I enjoy with other people I care about?

119,1cgs6zr,WIBTA by sharing my girlfriend is being stubborn?,"Throwaway account just in case.

Me (30m) and some other male friends, have been trying to plan a surprise girls trip for our significant others. During planning, I let my gf know that I would be busy that weekend with the boys so that she didn’t sign us up for any other activity.

She has been trying for a long time to plan a girls trip but the girls have not agreed or committed to anything. My gf had huge expectations of that girls trip and had imagined it in a specific way. 

My gf saw this as an opportunity to try to get her trip planned so I had to come up clean about the surprise getaway we had made for them. My gf straight up told me she didn’t wanted that and that she would prefer if I let her and the girls plan the whole thing.

I was ok with that - sort of. Later I learned that all the other girls were actually happy about the surprise and wanted us to plan it. None of them felt strongly about the getaway plans my gf was trying to make and were really happy to find out that the guys had take the initiative to plan something even though it was different than what they had discussed about.

I am torn. I’ve tried to nudge my gf to feel the same. They can always plan another trip later. I have asked her point blank if she wants to go and she tells me she needs to think about it. She is fixated by the idea that the guys took control and that they are not allowing the girls to have a longer getaway. I, standing in the middle, feel that she’s being stubborn and has a “my way or the highway attitude”. 

I have so far not shared this with the guys. I think if they hear it probably would cause a lot of bad blood from them to her and that would also hurt the girls feelings as she is preferring her own opinion to sharing time with them.

I need to vent and catch other points of view.
So I'm going back to my country to visit my family (from my mother side) never came back since I was 8y old (31y now) but we kept contact all this year's.
I'm taking my son and husband to meet all of them, and we are planning to rent a house and have a weekend there with all the family together in once.
My husband first though it was a good ideia, and suggested we could pay the rest of the stay. I thought it was a good idea as well, I never went back, really want to pay the rest, to show love and appreciation for my aunt's and because as a tradition once we married we didn't accomplish with the mandatory steps.
But it's not a obligation is just something that is important to me, but at this point my husband changed his mind and refuses to do it.
Now I Don't know what to say to him, but I'm a bit mad.

121,1cgrfk0,AITA for not allowing guests to poop at my house?,"Me (42F) and my husband (49M) own a home and enjoy hosting friends and relatives. Here's the thing: I am completely disgusted by the thought of other people's poop. The thought of another person that's not me or my husband defecating in my house fills me with disgust, dread, and anxiety. As such, it's always been a policy in my house that guests are not allowed to poop in my toilet. I am very clear on this whenever we have guests over. Guests are allowed to pee in our bathroom, but that's it. If they really need to go #2, I just ask that they please go somewhere else to do that. I have made this policy clear to all our guests in the past and it has never been an issue. Hubby has always disagreed with me on this, and I can tell he thinks I'm being ridiculous, but he doesn't fight me on it.

&#x200B;

  
Well, this past weekend hubby and I were hosting friends at our house, another couple: Courtney (40F) and Mike (41M). Court and Mike stayed the night with us after we all had a little too much to drink and they crashed on our couch. Court and Mike have been to our house many times and are well aware of this rule. That's why, when I woke up the next morning, I was appalled to find 'evidence' that someone had recently pooped in the downstairs bathroom. Without being TMI, there was that lingering stink smell mixed with febreze and markings in the toilet bowl... Yuck. Upon discovering this I immediately felt a sense of panic setting in. More than anything I was deeply upset and hurt by the disrespect of my guests. (It wouldn't have been my husband, as he uses our upstairs bathroom).

&#x200B;

  
I angrily marched over to our guests in the living room. Mike asked what was wrong. I told them I had just been in the bathroom to get a tissue, and that it stunk in there with was a mess in the toilet. In my anger, I said that I have one big rule in this house and if they ""want to act like pigs then they aren't welcome to stay over anymore."" Mike looked confused, so Court fessed up that she ""really had to go to the bathroom"" and she ""didn't think I would be out of bed for a while."" She looked embarrassed and her face turned red. She was initially apologetic, and I admit this was a bit harsh, but I told her what she did was disgusting, unsanitary, and that it was disrespectful to me to violate my boundaries like that by getting her germs all over my bathroom. Court suddenly got defensive, called me ""insane,"" and we had a little back-and-forth before she and Mike decided to leave. She left my house crying.  
My husband was irritated with me and said I was being unfair to Courtney and should apologize, and that I should stop enforcing this rule in general. I told him my reaction was fair because she was being disrespectful of my boundaries, and she could have easily driven 5 mins down the road to a public restroom but chose not to.

&#x200B;

  
We haven't heard from Courtney and Mike since.

But like this guy I share a few classes with is obsessed with becoming my friends it’s so annoying, I ignore him most of the time but he just follows me everywhere and talks to me anyway. He forced me into letting him come home with me and he met my mom. He told my mom that it’s really admirable how great of a mom she is even though my dad is gone and then he told her that he was sorry for her loss, he’s so weird I don’t know why he said any of this honestly. She was really confused and he told her that I told him that my dad’s dead.

It’s not really a lie anyway because my dad might be dead I don’t know if he is and anyway it’s not like i’m ever gonna see him again so it is like he’s sorta dead. Lying about my dad was working out though because I didn’t speak to too many people so I didn’t have to lie about my dad much anyway and nobody who thinks my dad is dead will ever meet my mom because we’re not friends so it’s not like my mom would ever be able to tell them the truth.

But like this guy I share a few classes with is obsessed with becoming my friends it’s so annoying, I ignore him most of the time but he just follows me everywhere and talks to me anyway. He forced me into letting him come home with me and he met my mom. He told my mom that it’s really admirable how great of a mom she is even though my dad is gone and then he told her that he was sorry for her loss, he’s so weird I don’t know why he said any of this honestly. She was really confused and he told her that I told him that my dad’s dead. My mom told him that I lied and got really annoyed at me, she yelled at me and told me I need to stop lying to people who want to be my friend otherwise I won’t have any or something. My mom has been really upset with me since, she told me that she’s worried about me (?). My kind of friend hasn’t spoken to me since but I don’t really care about him I just care  my mom like I feel kinda bad for making her worry and whatever like I didn’t mean to, I didn’t think this would be such a big deal?

127,1cgp8lw,AITA for not telling my friend what her partner was saying? I think I already know the answer ,"My best friend - A
Friends partner- B

I used to do OF...as you may or may not know, the people can be anon on there and you won't  know who it is. I had a sub on there for a few months. One day, he said something to me that was weird for him to know. I messaged A and told her how weird this is and I wonder who it could be? I was sending A screenshots of the convo and photos he had sent etc we were trying to figure out who it could be as it was obviously someone I knew. Then A sent a reply and said ""I think it's.."" her BOYFRIEND. I said no fking way as if. And she kept saying yes it is. By this point I felt sick to my stomach. 

We determined that it was in fact him. I felt so disgusted and violated as he shouldn't of been on there but was anonymously. I imagine A felt even worse. At that point A wasn't blaming me as it wasn't my fault because I didn't know it was him. 
Later she asked me to screenshot and send her the entire convo from OF and any of our messages together in general. I sent them all without a thought. 

I hardly know her partner never really spoke to him in person I thought he was shy and I was convinced that he was a good partner to my friend. I was obviously wrong. 
Before finding out it was him on OF about a couple of months prior B started messaging me and i thought it was innocent, because to me it was. There was a music festival coming up that A had mentioned she wanted to go with me. B messaged me about it saying he will pay for her and my tickets to go etc and then A  said she didn't want to go anymore and would rather the money be spent on something else. B asked if I still wanted to go and I said no only if S is. B said he was going to go and lie to A about going. I said to B he better tell her or I will. I know I should've just told A myself what he was saying but I didn't.

 
A few weeks after that B messaged me again saying there's a p!nk concert coming up and asked if I think A would like it I said I wasn't too sure and he should communicate with her but I wanted to go to her concert a while ago but wasn't gonna go as it was too expensive. B said he'd pay for me and A to go.
A ended up telling me she didn't want him paying for stuff like that.

 A few weeks later A birthday was coming up and I wanted to do something fun with her for her bday. I tried to organise something but it didn't end up happening. I was also telling B  he should take her somewhere nice for her bday etc and was trying to figure out dates with him for when he'd be home from work and able to look after their kids so me and A could go out.
Now maybe my priorities were wrong but all I wanted to do was go out and do something with my best friend. I never wanted her man but she thinks otherwise. 
This whole thing was stressing me out for weeks I couldn't eat or sleep properly knowing I hurt my friends feelings. Now she won't reply to me and I don't know what to do. Her partner lied and denied it for days. She is trying to fix their relationship. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-30,"AITA for not telling my friend what her partner was saying?

129,1cgox85,AITA for telling my mom it’s creepy to take pictures of strangers?,"(Throwaway because my main has identifying info on it.)

The other day, my (28F) mom (62F) told me that while she was at the park near our local library, she took pictures and videos of two men playing basketball with a little boy. I got upset with her invading their privacy, and told her how inappropriate and creepy it was to do that, especially to the boy, without their knowledge or consent. She also told me there were girls at the park who yelled at her not to film them, but she swore to me that she wasn’t filming the girls, but rather the sun through the trees at that time. (I trust her on that part.)

She argued that since they were in public, she could do what she wanted, and since cameras are everywhere, people should just expect to be filmed in public. I told her that it’s not okay to think that being in public is consent to being on some stranger’s camera roll, even IF intentions are pure. (Impact > intent.) Also, security cameras are there for protection (and have their OWN harmful surveillance issues), whereas actively filming specific people (especially a minor) in public is NOT for safety.

We both yelled at each other in the argument, and I ended it by saying that we would HAVE to discuss it when we both had time to cool down.

Unfortunately, we never got to have the calm discussion, because today, she told me she had filmed the people who were working on our next door neighbor’s roof (but “don’t worry, because they didn’t film (HER)”).

Once again, I was livid with her thinking it’s okay to film strangers doing a JOB on PRIVATE property. She and I are also both white women, and the workers on the roof were not white, which makes me feel another layer of discomfort at her filming them.

I asked her how she’d feel if strangers did that to me at work, but she insisted it was “different because (I’m) a woman”. I told her that gender doesn’t matter in this situation at all, because everyone has a right to privacy, and it’s our moral obligation to not invade it just because someone dared to be in our line of sight.

After a while of yelling back and forth, I could tell she still had no regrets, and saw me as wrong/overreacting. Knowing I was getting nowhere, I told her to give me her phone. She, of course, said no, so I tried to grab her phone from on her bed, to delete the videos and pictures she took of the strangers. She laughed AT me as I grabbed for it, but then ended up getting a leg cramp in the process of trying to keep me away from her phone.

I backed off immediately bc I did NOT want to hurt her, stood there as her pain subsided, and then told her none of this was funny, and that she’s ruining our (close) relationship dying on this hill, as we almost never fight, so she needed to know I was deadly serious. Then I left her room, slamming the door behind me.

At this point he knows I’m allergic to his cat and not comfortable around his gf so I believe it’s clear I have no intentions of moving in.

My sister (25F) recently got kicked out from my Grandparents and has been house hopping for the past few months. She had lost her driver's license two years ago and doesn't have a car. Currently she has been house hopping between my house (Thursday- Sunday) and my Godparents place (Monday- Wednesday)

My sister is struggling with mental health problems and has a hard time maintaining and making relationships, she's often put as the villain in most things related to our family.

Since she has been house hopping, she constantly asks our mother and I to give her rides to places. I obviously say no, but my mom says yes most of the time which isn't good for her health as my mother has stage four cancer and needs to rest. My sister is terrible at saving/ spending money and would often use non-existent money to bribe me into taking her. She'll also borrow money and rarely ever pay it back. Everytime we put our foot down to get her to take the bus, she purposely doesn't make it in time and gets us to take her instead. 

Yesterday she finally got a lease for an apartment near her job and college but because she spent all of her money she can't pay for the deposit before the due date. My parents couldn't get any money as they're already barley scraping by. I currently am well off in money and will soon have enough to get my own apartment, and because of this she asked me to pay her deposit and she'll pay me back when she gets the chance, that way she won't be house hopping anymore and won't have to ask us for anymore rides.

My ex likes maps a lot, and we already had the Skyrim and GOT map, so when he saw my box set had a map, he said he wanted me to put it up next to the others. I told him that if we did that, I'd like to get it in a frame so that it wouldn't get torn up when we'd get it down.

He then insisted for half an hour that I was being ridiculous, pouted, and was overall unpleasant until I gave in and put up the map.

Now, I've taken my stuff out of the house and, lo and behold, when I took the map down, it torn in several places. Nothing that will be too noticeable when put in a proper frame, but still, it's damaged in every one of the ways I said it would be.

133,1cgoph7,AITA for not wanting to look after my mate's dogs anymore?,"TL;DR - have looked after my mate's 4 dogs for nearly 6 months and I'm over it.

High level story is my friend got himself in a spot of bother. His australian visa expired, he went on holiday and then wasnt allowed back in the country. This was September 2023. He had someone looking after his dogs for a bit but that fell through. Despite me having 2 big dogs of my own along with a thankfully understanding wife and 2 toddlers I offered to collect his dogs and look after them 'til he came home. That was November.

His situation sucks, it's a real shame and he's super unlucky.

Not as unlucky as his dogs though! 3 girls 1 boy. Not spayed. Yes, our man's a backyard breeder/puppy farm. It's shit, I hate it but it's not the dogs fault and they were basically going to be abandoned so like the soft touch I am I fetched his dogs. Pretty much brought them back from the fucking mange and have given them a loving family home for 6months for less than the cost he would have incurred had he put them in a kennel for a fortnight.

Kennel cost is $50 per dog per day. $200 a day for his 4. The deal was he pays me $300 every 4 weeks for food and tick/flea/worming tabs. He was late with the pament over christmas, fucking LOL, and hasn't paid the latest installment either. Anyway... the math is a kennel would cost, what, $2800 for a fortnight? He has so-far paid me $1500 and owes $300 to get him up to date (and his next installment due is May 9th).

I mentioned his dogs aren't spayed. I feel I must add that he misled me regarding their vax status and that they're hardly fucking trained either. I've done all I can but I still can't get them to shit on grass (he lived in a small 1 bedder in a city with no garden just a little patio, I'm lucky enough to live more rural and have big gardens). Even on the bush walks they shit on the path ... it's infuriating and no amount of treats and praise will sway them it seems. I have at least managed to stop them shitting in the house whenever they please and they have learned the basics.

Anyway, our man has had no luck breeding them. Typically, within 2 months of being in my care 2 of the 3 girls got pregnant. Fucking 11 puppies. There are 17 dogs in my house and I am over it. So. Fucking. Over it.

AITA? I'm not going to give him a single penny when I sell his pups as I'll be using those funds to fix the floors, decks and garden that his dogs have stained with their almost constant pissing and shitting (floors and decks) and digging (gardens).

TL;DR - have looked after my mate's 4 dogs for nearly 6 months and I'm over it.

High level story is my friend got himself in a spot of bother. His australian visa expired, he went on holiday and then wasnt allowed back in the country. This was September 2023. He had someone looking after his dogs for a bit but that fell through. Despite me having 2 big dogs of my own along with a thankfully understanding wife and 2 toddlers I offered to collect his dogs and look after them 'til he came home. That was November.

His situation sucks, it's a real shame and he's super unlucky.

Not as unlucky as his dogs though! 3 girls 1 boy. Not spayed. Yes, our man's a backyard breeder/puppy farm. It's shit, I hate it but it's not the dogs fault and they were basically going to be abandoned so like the soft touch I am I fetched his dogs. Pretty much brought them back from the fucking mange and have given them a loving family home for 6months for less than the cost he would have incurred had he put them in a kennel for a fortnight.

Kennel cost is $50 per dog per day. $200 a day for his 4. The deal was he pays me $300 every 4 weeks for food and tick/flea/worming tabs. He was late with the pament over christmas, fucking LOL, and hasn't paid the latest installment either. Anyway... the math is a kennel would cost, what, $2800 for a fortnight? He has so-far paid me $1500 and owes $300 to get him up to date (and his next installment due is May 9th).

I mentioned his dogs aren't spayed. I feel I must add that he misled me regarding their vax status and that they're hardly fucking trained either. I've done all I can but I still can't get them to shit on grass (he lived in a small 1 bedder in a city with no garden just a little patio, I'm lucky enough to live more rural and have big gardens). Even on the bush walks they shit on the path ... it's infuriating and no amount of treats and praise will sway them it seems. I have at least managed to stop them shitting in the house whenever they please and they have learned the basics.

Anyway, our man has had no luck breeding them. Typically, within 2 months of being in my care 2 of the 3 girls got pregnant. Fucking 11 puppies. There are 17 dogs in my house and I am over it. So. Fucking. Over it.

AITA? I'm not going to give him a single penny when I sell his pups as I'll be using those funds to fix the floors, decks and garden that his dogs have stained with their almost constant pissing and shitting (floors and decks) and digging (gardens).

135,1cgobjz,AITA for telling my friend I don't like their gf?,"I have a best friend Clara. Since I started dating my gf Sam 3 years ago, whenever I wanna meet Clara, we hang out mostly with Sam, as she usually stays at mine. Clara never expressed any bad feelings about it and they even hang out without me.

When Clara's ldr gf Alex came to our city, we decided to meet her in my apartment. Clara warned Alex is shy, I said no problem. Sam had to come 2 hours later. The first 2 hours were extremely long. I was the one making the small talk, which is hard for me, so I was desperately waiting for Sam to come and take my place as the conversation-pusher.

When Sam came, she made Alex all the compliments, Alex replied ""I know"". The evening became a disaster. After another round of small talk, Sam started asking Alex general questions about her, Alex said she needs more specific questions. Sam specified the questions, Alex replied ""Why do you need this info?"". She never asked anything back, then said ""I don't want to answer any questions"". Girl, the whole meeting is about us getting to know you, but ok.

Sam started talking about something else, like languages, cultures and history. Clara and I were laughing, having fun. We paid attention not to make Alex participate in the conversation unless she wanted to say something. Alex interrupted mid-sentence saying she's bored in a very rude voice. Sam smiled uncomfortably and asked her to suggest any topic she'd like to discuss. Alex said she has nothing to suggest. The room went silent. Sam suggested games and activities that don't require us talking to each other, to which Alex said she has no desire to play. I am all for sitting silently and relaxing, but with friends, not with a rude stranger at my place who I'm supposed to meet and know. She didn't look shy in the slightest, just plain arrogant.

At this point I was praying they leave already, because we just sat in awkward silence, occasionally Alex saying something about Genshin to Clara. Sam made an excuse and made them leave.

The next day, Clara texted me asking what do I think about Alex and the nice evening we had. I replied honestly, pretty much saying everything I wrote here, telling her I have no idea how to interact with her girlfriend and would like some sort of instruction in case we meet again. She just replied she had no idea I was uncomfortable, and been distant ever since.

I miss Clara and feel I might be TA for outright telling the truth, but realistically I think it's Alex who's supposed to apologize to me and Sam. AITA for telling the truth? AITA for not wanting to hang out with Alex despite us often hanging out with Sam?

137,1cgnzek,AITA for refusing to trick my great granny aka lie to her for my dad?,"My maternal great granny loves to make blankets and baby clothes. She did it for all her kids and then for her grandkids and she continued the tradition for her great grandkids. When my parents had me (17f) and then my brother (14m) she made us a really cute baby blanket each. All my maternal cousins have them as well.

When my mom was alive my dad was close to my maternal family. They had a really good relationship. But when my mom died 6 years ago and dad moved in a new woman, who is now his wife, 10 months later (they had been dating for 2/3 months) it fractured their relationship beyond repair. My grandparents and great granny asked dad to slow down for the sake of my brother and me. We had already told him it was too fast for us and we told our maternal family. Dad accused them of only doing it because he was moving on and that they wouldn't have responded so strongly to mom moving on so fast. They told him they would if we had struggled. That more than anything they believed kids needed to be considered in this time. That he could date but to slow down with moving forward. My great granny especially took it hard because she saw how miserable we were during that time.

The relationship came to a final close when 6 months later none of our maternal family attended his wedding.

My dad and his wife are now expecting a baby together. Dad asked if he could take one of our baby blankets and use it for the new baby. We both said no. Our grandparents have them stored at their house and we told them we didn't want them shared.

Dad asked grandma if she'd make a blanket for his new baby, because she has started up what great granny does, and grandma said no. They hardly ever talk and only when my grandparents take us to their house or want to take us places. He hasn't spoken to great granny since the wedding. He did write her a letter asking and she ignored it which upset dad a lot. He went to my grandparents again and grandma told him the new baby was not her family so she wasn't going to make a blanket for them.

Dad then asked me to trick great granny into making one. He said I could pretend I want a second blanket that fits me better at the age I'm at now. And that I could give it to the baby. I told him he was asking me to lie to great granny and that was wrong. I also told him he needed to accept the baby wasn't part of their family and they didn't want to make the blanket. His wife found out that I had refused and she told me the baby might not be their family but I was also making it clear I don't see the baby as part of mine and that my brother was acting the same way. She said it made us terrible people to reject a baby that was part of us, part of our family.

Then a few days after my dad told me he didn't ask me for favors ever and this was something I could/should do for him. I refused. He told me I was making this harder. He also accused me of punishing the baby for him moving on faster than I would have liked.

Today, while my MIL, housekeeper, and grandma were inside my BF's apartment, my FIL was at work, and my BF was just arriving, the apartment exploded and burned down due to a gas leak (apparently). Most of it is unrecognizable. Sadly, his cat, whom we all loved dearly, passed away in the fire.

As the firefighters and police were trying to contain the fire, they managed to rescue the cat. The paramedics attempted to revive him, but to no avail. They handed the cat to me since my MIL and BF were experiencing severe panic attacks. I had my mother come to pick him up and take him to the vet. After they confirmed that there was nothing to do for him, my mother made the decision to have him cremated.

My FIL called later saying he wanted to see the cat, but they had already taken him to the crematorium and don’t disclose information on where that is, this is the first time I let them know. I helped them move all I could from the house after the fire receded and explained to MIL that there was nothing I could do about them seeing the cat (this was a couple of hours after he passed) and left with my BF to help him calm down. Later, FIL arrived at the house some four hours later, expressing his desire to see the cat. I told them again how things happened and helped all I could to move some other things that were left in the apartment. However, MIL and FIL started going on about how that wasn’t my choice to make and how they wanted to see him, berating me for doing my best to help them. Despite my efforts to explain the situation, my in-laws insisted on seeing the cat, becoming increasingly upset. I repeatedly apologized and explained the circumstances, but tensions escalated. I tried to extract myself from the situation several times only to be called back. My BF, in an attempt to defuse the situation, was met with hostility from his parents, who berated him.

The argument escalated to the point where my MIL was screaming and waving a finger close to my face, and my FIL was on the verge of physical violence. MIL's sister, instead of diffusing the situation, added fuel to the fire by insisting on knowing the cat's whereabouts and supporting my in-laws' accusations against me.

Despite my repeated assurances that I didn't have the information they sought, the situation continued to deteriorate. Feeling overwhelmed and threatened, I reached a breaking point. In response to my MIL's aggressive behavior, I confronted her away using my chest and chaos ensued.

Ultimately, my BF and I were asked to leave, and my MIL and sis made repeated threats against me. It's clear they hate me now, and I can't help but feel terrible about the situation. I understand that they were distraught and suffering from their loss, but I did my best to offer support and empathy.

141,1cgnt9x,AITA? I am straight. My gay roommate told me everyone thinks we are a couple,"My gay friend of many years was kind enough to let me rent me his spare rooms after my divorce. He’s one of my best friends and we go eat together, ride bikes and go on walks occasionally, and have a large group of friends. I have 2 teenage children that are my world. They stay with me half the time. This evening after some drinks he said, “you know everyone in the neighborhood thinks we are a couple?” I was taken aback. “No, I didn’t know that, why would you say that?” “Well, we spend a lot of time together and that’s the belief around town now!” I told him I didn’t like this rumor, cause it isn’t the truth and I don’t want this lie putting me in a difficult position with my kids. I have raised them very socially aware and inclusive and tolerant. He was super offended that I didn’t want to be labeled gay, even though I am straight. He called me a jerk for even caring what people think about my sexuality, and I told him it’s my right to care what people think. I feel gaslighted and manipulated. AITA for taking a stance in this scenario?! 

*Edit #1* 
For more context about the situation…I have woken up and he has been next to me in bed without my permission. He gets drunk and flirty and touchy and I have to tell him to please stop. I’ve established boundaries but he pushes them too far and it makes me uncomfortable. This is why I feel like he has feelings and maybe pushing the idea of being a couple, which I absolutely do not want with him! I’m not homophobic in the slightest, but don’t touch me without my permission and don’t assume I want to be a couple with you. I pay my bills, I just want a roommate, nothing more.

Don’t use Reddit much but now realize I should have clarified the edits. I didn’t add the context in edit #1 cause it’s was an entirely different issue in my mind. I see how it correlates now. Not trying to save face. These are details that probably do matter to the entire situation. Going to have a conversation with him about physical boundaries.

142,1cgnnfj,AITA for accidentally sleeping with my situationships roommate,"Alright basically I have been involved with this girl for a few months now, we talk a lot and hook up just as much. I sleepover at her dorm on campus probably 3 times a week so I also know her roommate pretty well. Her roommate is also my coworker so we are all friends, I actually met the roommate before my situationship, Me and this girl have a good dynamic however we tend to argue a lot which usually is more playful in nature. Sometimes however when I actually do piss her off we can get kinda loud and she gets pretty worked up cause I like to mess with her lmao. 

Anyway last night she was doing homework and I was bugging her cause I was bored. She flipped out a little and told me to go to the living room so she could work and that I was overstimulating her. Not a big deal it's a semi-regular thing as I have ADHD and can be annoying not gonna lie. Anyway her roommate was in the living room with her friend taking shots while watching a TV show. They asked if I wanted to join and I agreed because I had nothing to do today and was staying over and wasn't driving. My situationship (let's call her Vanessa) walked out a few times over the next two hours to get food and drinks, and each time she came and talked to me and even kissed me on one pass by. She wasn't bothered and was just glad I was leaving her alone to work but would be there in the morning to gym. 

We got pretty slammed and I honestly passed out cause we also hit a wax pen. I woke up on the couch shirtless and her roommate was wearing my shirt laying on me. As soon as I realized she was on me I jumped up which woke her up and we started arguing. I asked ""Why the fuck are you on top of me what the hell Where is Vanessa?"". The roommate replied ""it's fine I just got cold Vanessa knows I'm not like that."". Well Vanessa wasn't in her room and that means she walked right by us and must've left. I knew I was FUCKED vanessa is LATINA. I knew Vanessa had class so I couldn't call, so I went and got her favorite matcha and a chocolate croissant then waited outside her class. As soon as she walked out I got up and walked up but she ignored me and was crying. I tried to explain but she blew up on me which drew a lot of attention then she walked away and I followed her trying to explain until we got to her dorm. We took the argument to her living room and eventually her roommate joined in and vouched that I passed out before she did and I did nothing wrong. Vanessa then told me to leave so she could talk to her roommate alone and that's where I am now I am in the campus library writing this.

144,1cgnbh6,AITA for shutting my ILs down when they brought up issues with photos of my children's mom in our home?,"I (46m) have two children; Fia (13f) and Cael (10m). Their mom died five years ago in a car crash. We had been married at the time but only legally. For the last three years of her life we were pretending to still be together and we stayed married, but it was all pretending for the kids. We did not want to divorce for our kids' sake. Both of us came from divorced families and what I consider broken homes because of how badly our parents handled the divorces. We didn't want that for the kids.  We feared we couldn't do better. The end result was us hating each other. It ran deep too. I regret that now. The last words we exchanged were not kind. Our kids deserved better than that. Better than having parents who hated each other because we were so afraid to divorce.

So after she died I was determined to let go of all that hate and I was determined to make sure the kids knew they were loved by both parents and were not burdened by the issues we'd had. Their mom and dad both love them. I truly believe their mom's love still exists for them in them. And they deserve to know that love. That was what I focused on. So I saved everything of hers for them. It's all stored safely for them one day. And a couple of years after she died, I did remove most of the photos of our married life. But I let the kids keep two photos of their choice out in the open in common areas of the house. The rest are either in their room or stored for them with the rest of her stuff. My kids love and miss their mom so much and it brings them comfort to have her photos out. I make sure they can always talk about her or ask questions. They also have a very close relationship with the three siblings she spoke to. This is my children's home above all and I make sure it always feels that way.

When I met my wife (I remarried last year) I told her about the photos and said a partner of mine needed to accept this. She did. We got married. Nobody has taken the photos of my kids and their mom down. But my ILs do have a problem (and maybe they're speaking on behalf of my wife and she's not open I'm still figuring that out). They were staying with us at the weekend and during a dinner they questioned my kids about keeping the photos out when my wife now lives with us. My kids said they like having photos of their mom they can see in the house. My ILs began to say that it was inconsiderate of my wife and they should not be in common areas when I stepped in and shut them down and I told them that this is still my children's home too and part of that is displaying photos of their mom in their home where they can be seen. I told them it did not need to be discussed more.

The following day my ILs said I had no reason to be so rude and I had an unhealthy attachment to keeping their mom present in their lives when she's dead. They told me they should be allowed to question things about their daughter's home and I overreacted.

Also he gets mad that I get hungry when I’m out of school..uhm I go to school from 9-2:20pm, is it like bad to be hungry? I was so pissed!! Another thing is that he did some blood tests and he got something bad and now everybody on the house has to eat healthy like salads and chicken etc, don’t get me wrong I love that food and whatever but when I was in that situation, he used to buy candy and unhealthy food and said “oh she is on a diet not me” and now look at him. Another thing is that made me feel like crying I guess I don’t know.. but the thing is my dad was going to give my brother 10 dollars I was like okay but what about me damm, don’t give me wrong again I’m not mad or jealous of my brother but you know broke college here wanted too 😭. And my dad told me “I’m already paying 50 dollars for your anxiety pills” like okay? That’s a need you know and I told him “maybe if people shut their mouth and make me have a peace life I would be fine” and that’s where I felt like is it my fault? Why is it my fault? If it’s other people were hurting me and it became worse. I was bully since elementary to high school and end up with depression and high anxiety that every morning I had to throw up. It would be fine if he would he said no but he said that and that made me so mad and I wanted to cry. Another thing that happened is that when I was helping my mom did a work he needed to be send to a email and I’m not really good at that, that I needed to ask my dad and just a simple task he just started to say to me “you don’t know how to do this,you don’t know college, you don’t know blah blah” and I was like what?

150,1cgmqpk,AITA for asking the lady at the gas pump to move her car forward?,"Hi. I (m38) pulled into my local gas station to get some diesel (I was driving my old Toyota 4Runner) and food, all but 3 of the pumps were occupied and a 4wd pulled into 1 and I didn’t want the 1 behind it as it only has the basic diesel, I fill my car up with premium diesel. 

I noticed a lady walk up to her car and space behind her so I pulled in there not realising how far back she was parked and that I couldn’t actually reach the pump.

No worries she’ll be driving off soon I thought and I can use the front pump, nope she proceeded to start putting air in her tyres, starting with the back left and she knew I was there waiting. 

I waited for her to do the tyre thinking it might only be one but then she started to move onto the next one so I beeped my horn to get her attention and motioned with my hand for her to move her car forward. 

Another customer (middle aged man) immediately came up to my car and started abusing me telling me she wasn’t doing anything wrong. I tried to explain my point of view but he wouldn’t have it. Then a male staff member came out and stepped between him and my car window, this was good on his part. 

Once the hero got back in his car the staff member asked me what my problem was. I told him and he replied with “she wasn’t parked back towards the middle of the 2 pumps and I could’ve reached the pump, This wasn’t the case though as if I’d tried to do so my car would’ve been touching hers and I still wouldn’t have been able fill up my car, this felt like gaslighting on his part so I told him he was a fuck’n idiot and that I’d take my money to a different gas station.

151,1cgmjl0,AITA for not forgiving my dad for being a bad father?,"I’ve never wrote a Reddit post before I’ve only seen social media posts about it and I feel like I need advice because I can’t tell anyone else this. I’m about to turn 17 and my dad who’s in his 40’s has been in and out of jail my whole life. But about 3 years ago he got out of prison after being in there for around 8 years. When he came out he did good but he’s falled back into old habits now.

 He drinks almost every day again he always was an alcoholic. When I was younger he got my mom kicked out of all her houses because he would just destroy things when he was drunk and mad. The only reason we lived in our house for so long was because he was in prison. I was young but even then I remember how horrible he acted when drunk. I even remember him pushing my pregnant mother against a closet door and screaming in her face when I was about 6. 
 
When he was arrested me and my newborn sister were with him while my mother was at work. I remember crying so hard thinking I would never see him again that the officers were trying to comfort me and my sister while waiting for my mom. But that wasn’t even the first time I had been with my dad when he got caught almost all my early memories were with him handcuffed in the backseat of cop cars with me sitting right next to him. The other memories with him was when he took me to this house and sat me on a couch with a bunch of strangers while he went in a room. I don’t know what he did in there but he was in there for so long that the sun would be down by the time he came out.

Now with all the anger he has and all the harm he’s doing again I’ve grown resentful towards him. When I look at him all I feel sadness and disappointment. I know it’s wrong to think this but I’m tired of forgiving someone who keeps making false promises of change. I’m only 16 I don’t know everything he’s done and been through and I have a nice life thanks to my mother’s hard work and sacrifice but I’m starting to have unhealthy thoughts some times. I don’t think I’ll do anything because I have to take care of my sister but all the hurt he caused me and my family is stuck in the back of my mind. Everyone forgives him and he can charm strangers so easily I don’t get how can someone who acts like that can be liked so greatly. 

Maybe because they don’t see the pain e puts my mom through or the feeling of loneliness his kids feel because of a lack of a father. My older brother even started getting in trouble with the law just like my dad because he was never there for him. And he wasn’t there for the first part of my younger sister’s life. I think he knows I can’t forgive him anymore. I created a wall between us when we use to be so close. And I know it’s my fault we drifted apart but sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom or late at night when nobody’s awake I cry because I miss my daddy and I miss when I was his princess and he loved me. I don’t know what to do anymore.

152,1cgm81b,AITA for parking a motorized bike at a bike rack?,"It's probably best if I describe the bike and my parking first, because that's what this hinges off of.

Now motorized bike makes it sound large, but it's not really that big. It's a tiny 50cc scooter thing, that tops out at 30 mph. A little vespa thing. It's about the same size as a bike, just a little longer. including handlebar width, but the actual body of the bike is a few times wider than a normal bike. It's also substantially easier for me to use because of its seat. I can't ride bikes because of the seat, but I don't know if that's important.

Whenever I park it, since it's essentially just a motorized bike with a fancy storage seat and footrest, I have to park it locked to something. The bike is essentially in permanent neutral, no lock or anything on its wheels making it absurdly easy to steal by simply rolling it onto a trailer or truck bed. I'd know, ive had to steal my own bike twice because I've locked the keys in it. The best option usually is a bike rack, since I can't lock it around light poles and I can't park in handicap spots. I park it parallel to the building or even between the building and the rack, as opposed to straight on to the rack, and I chain it to the very last pole of the rack, as far out of the way as it can go, because I thought it'd give bicycle riders more space to deal with their bikes.

I went to the store for a gallon of milk yesterday, and I took it instead of my car because it gets good mpg, it was a nice day, and I only needed one thing. I parked it like I described, essentially wedged between the rack and the building, locked to the pole that connects with the ground. The rack wasnt full at all, with maybe one bike there on the other end. I come out, and this angry looking man is standing by the rack. When I went to the bike to put my milk and a bag of chips (look buddy we've all been there) away in it, he said:

""who the fuck do you think you are, parking that shit here?""

And I said ""excuse me? Is there an issue?""

To which he responded with ""yeah, your stupid fucking gas bike is in the normal bike rack. You're lucky someone didn't cut your brake lines, moron. Next time ride a bike, you lazy fucking asshole.""

He then walked into the store, I unchained the scooter, checked it for damage, especially the brakes, and left. I was shocked because I'd never been made aware there was a problem with that parking method in the year I've done it, until this guy told me rather aggressively there was.

So, am I actually an asshole? Is the parking that bad that it warranted that reaction, or is he going overboard? If i was bad, how would you all suggest I park it in the future so I both keep it secure and don't interfere with cyclists?

  
edit: cant lock it to a light pole because the lock isnt long enough to fit around the concrete pole base. also i fear a driver will hit it if its parked in a normal spot like that since they wont be able to see it.",Asshole,2024-04-30,"AITA for parking a motorized bike at a bike rack?

It was thirty minutes past midnight. Not past his birthday.  No. It had only been his birthday for thirty minutes.  Would it have been sweet and cute to be first to wish him happy birthday.  Sure. It definitely would.   

 For some context I struggle with time blindness.  I set alarms for anything important.  I had set an alarm a few days before for noon the day of his birthday.  He usually doesn’t wake up till about 4pm.  We talk on the phone evenings and nights when he works out of town. He is nightshift. 

He said because I was awake at midnight and didn’t remember then it just shows how I don’t care about him.  I think he is looking for an excuse to end our marriage.  He threatens ending it often.    I apologized and told him that I did not remember what the date was at that moment.  But he wasn’t letting it go with that. I didn’t really know what to do. Was pretty much shocked.  Ended up a very heated argument.  It just seems like a pretty extreme reaction but maybe I’m just too in it to see his perspective clearly.

154,1cgks23,AITA for bringing up my feelings about a coat my mum (67F) bought for me (29F)?,"
For context, my mum was a teacher (now retired). We were sorting through items and the coat she bought me years ago appeared. I mentioned that I remembered the circumstances around that coat. She had bought one for a student for hers and then decided to buy the same coat from me. Not overly expensive at $40, but not a piece of clothing she had or would otherwise have ever bought for me up until then.

For context, the student had a poor homelife, had a disability, and as far as the school knew her parents struggled to care of her. Teachers buying items was quite normal and in fact usual tasks at the school involved doing the shopping for students who needed help.

I was a teen, about 14-15yo. My mum had up intil this point never bought me anything of the sort - I was always clothed in basics, never had the ""luxury"" of owning a jacket/coat, and knowing that my mum didnt spend on such things, even if I had asked the answer would have been no (I did ask for things as a child, and soon gave up after I realised the answer would 95% if the time be a it's not necessary, a no). And no not even for birthday gifts. A coat/jacket was what I considered a luxury. Yet, here she buys me this 'second in mind' to the student. It's petty but I have stomached a lifetime of this, her dismissing anything i have said.

As I grew up in a very frugal household, I wore hand me down clothing and hardly ever wore anything new. When we did go clothes shopping, it was to buy underwear. Extremely ocasionally, a new t-shirt. But certainly not a nice looking coat.

So seeing that my mum had bought this for a student was hurtful to me at the time, despite knowing that the student would obviously have loved the gift.

Anyway, when I alluded to that at the time my mum had a total freak out talking about how I'm ungrateful, she had meant well, she thought it was a nice coat, put no further thought into it, I blame her for everything, etc. etc., she can do no right. I decided to drop it.

This time merely mentioning it and thinking my mother would react differently was a mistake. I don't blame her and I just wanted to talk about feelings from when I was a child. The response that I think would have been fine would've been 'yes i know how that could have come off, i didn't know you felt that' acknowledging that I could feel hurt is all i naively hoped for after all these years. I should've known better than that, she has reacted the exact same way as then. I clarified that I was just talking about my perspective as a child, at the time, I said nothing about blame. She is now stone-walling me.

I'm not even angry, I'm disappointed. She doesn't have the emotional capacity to hear my thoughts without going full defensive and taking it as blaming her as a parent.

I then posted it on Facebook for memories, and tagged John and my close friends. Thanking everyone for a wonderful night. 

Fast forward to this year. It popped up on my newsfeed and I reshared it. I put, this night is definitely one for the books. Such great memories. Well, I am no longer dating John. We had broken up four years ago. The next day John messaged me, asking if I can take down the video. His girlfriend feels uncomfortable that I still have videos of us together in in that video. I told him no. I no longer have any of the original videos and photos, because this was five years ago. Plus, this is my only memories of my close family and friends, and some who I no longer see anymore. I also told him, if his girlfriend felt uncomfortable, I'll untag him so they both don't have to see anymore.

 I guess that wasn't enough for her, because apparently we had mutual friends who sees the videos still. She then messages me the next day and ask me to delete the video. She doesn't like that fact I still have videos of her man. I explained to her again of what I told John. She then accused me that I still miss him and want him back. That's why I reshared it in the first place, and won't delete it. I just told her she's crazy and blocked them both.

Fast forward to this year. It popped up on my newsfeed and I reshared it. I put, this night is definitely one for the books. Such great memories. Well, I am no longer dating John. We had broken up four years ago. The next day John messaged me, asking if I can take down the video. His girlfriend feels uncomfortable that I still have videos of us together in in that video. I told him no. I no longer have any of the original videos and photos, because this was five years ago. Plus, this is my only memories of my close family and friends, and some who I no longer see anymore. I also told him, if his girlfriend felt uncomfortable, I'll untag him so they both don't have to see anymore.

 I guess that wasn't enough for her, because apparently we had mutual friends who sees the videos still. She then messages me the next day and ask me to delete the video. She doesn't like that fact I still have videos of her man. I explained to her again of what I told John. She then accused me that I still miss him and want him back. That's why I reshared it in the first place, and won't delete it. I just told her she's crazy and blocked them both. ",0.0,0.9915301203727722,1,0

I texted my friend the day before and she agreed. We are pretty close and I usually take her home every other week because she's always too lazy to bike to school. I also buy her a lot of stuff like food and way more stuff, so she owes me. It was the first time she has ever done anything for me like taking me home.

160,1cgjth0,WIBTAH if I never spoke to my friend after what they did?,"This has been on my mind for a little while now. I (25F) have a friend that I had an argument with not too long ago. I’m trying to be a little more vague in case they find out it’s them so let’s call them Sam. Sam and I have been friends for years. I’ve had their back and they’ve had mine through thick and thin. More recently though, things have been sort of tense between Sam and I. 

When we would hang out or talk, it became about only what they wanted to do or what they wanted to talk about. I couldn’t really talk about my interests or about my day to day without Sam becoming completely uninterested to the point of being straight up silent on me. When Sam had a bad day, they were extra pushy about only talking about and doing what they wanted to do. 

Because of this, I started feeling the need to avoid Sam some days. If I tried talking to them about these concerns, Sam would just claim they weren’t forcing me to do anything I didn’t wanna do, or that they weren’t asking for much. But Sam almost seemed to expect me to use every moment I had free time to talk to them or hang out with them. But I have a spouse, a job and a household to take care of. I didn’t always have time for them. This made Sam upset. I give all this to give the context that things were already tense between us. 

Now for the incident. I recently found out I am expecting. When I found out, I wanted to tell all my close family and friends, Sam included. When I told them, however, I was met with anger instead of happiness. Sam said this was going to be bad, that my spouse and I should have been more safe (because that was appropriate) and that I could lose my job. It hurt when Sam said that. I told Sam that the rant wasn’t necessary and they just replied with “I’m sorry that’s just how I feel. I can’t be happy for you right now.” They said they needed time to take it in. We didn’t talk for a little while after that, then the big argument came. 

We had just started talking again when I started getting good news about the baby. By this point Sam had apologized and gave their congrats. When I told them about it. I was met with a short, annoyed response. When I pressed about it, Sam went on this rant about how I already barely pay attention to them, but when I have my baby, I’ll have no time for them at all. And that even if we do hang out, I’ll have my kid with me and they won’t feel comfortable with that because they don’t really care for kids. And even if I don’t push my kid on them (which I would never do), they wouldn’t be comfortable with it. 

Sam just makes it seem like because I’m moving into this new phase of life, we can’t be friends anymore. Sam said his final point that things won’t be all sunshine and rainbows with this.

I have a 4 year old dog, whose mixed breeds are known as hunters who track prey and also herd. My dad enjoys taking my dog for a walk and often comes to my house with my permission and walks the dog - whether I’m there or not. Here’s the issue, he refuses to put her on a leash and instead lets her roam free - and he insists upon it. He is strict about her staying near him, and for the most part she listens fairly well. However, I am concerned that one of these days she’s going to take off and get hit by a car, or even encounter another dog and get hurt, scare someone, etc.

I have asked my dad repeatedly to use the leash which is easily accessible to him and he even usually brings it with him. I’m at the point where 1) I fear for my dogs safety and 2) on a deeper level am disappointed my dad won’t respect a simple and what I would consider a reasonable request of mine.

163,1cgjksz,WIBTA if I told my professor how much my teammates actually contributed?,"I am a senior in a mechanical engineering program. Our largest project is 2 semesters long. This group project is for design and the group consists of 4 people. Me, Lauren, Rachel, and Jack. Rachel and Jack got married last semester and Lauren also got married. Additionally, I am partners with Rachel in another class, which I will refer to as the small project. 

With the situation I am in now, either 2 students who do not deserve their degrees get their degrees as planned, or I potentially ruin the next 6 months of their lives by delaying their graduation a semester. I am having a hard time finding the line between being fair and being an asshole. 

For the design project last semester, when Rachel and Jack severely under-contributed, I blamed it on the fact that a wedding is stressful to plan and have. I thought this semester would be different; otherwise, I would have asked them not to be in my group anymore. 

For the design project I have done the vast majority of the work. Lauren has also contributed heavily. Throughout this semester Jack has gotten increasingly condescending and rude. If you do not love his idea he will not only raise his voice and be demeaning, if he is upset enough he throws a tantrum like a child, including stomping his feet and other immature actions. 

For the design project, many schedules and project divisions were created. Though at the beginning of the semester, they were equal, as Rachel and Jack did not make their contributions, their original larger assignments were broken up, and parts were re-allocated. Eventually, Lauren and I completed the majority of the project. 

By the end of the project, I asked Rachel and Jack for their contributions (for the 50th time), and they barely had anything. I  then did their contributions for the design that night. 

During this night, however, I did not respond to Rachel's text messages for 4 hours, as she and I had been rude. She then decided to go to our professor who is over our small project, and say that she could not work with me since I do not communicate. 

Not only is this bad for my academic reputation, but that professor is also my boss at work. 

The final straw is that when writing the last portions of the paper I saw Rachel's ""contribution"" list. It included many tasks that she simply did not contribute to, or that she barely contributed to and Lauren I completed. 

The issue is that all 4 of us are about to graduate. Either the teacher only takes Lauren and me a little seriously and drops Rachel and Jack's grades down, or he understands the gravity of the situation and fails them, delaying their graduation. Though I would love the satisfaction of their actions having real consequences, I would feel terribly guilty for delaying someone's graduation. They have already paid for their cap and gowns, made graduation plans, and begun their job search. Additionally being a snitch is kind of an asshole move in the first place.

If you do not love his idea he will not only raise his voice and be demeaning, if he is upset enough he throws a tantrum like a child, including stomping his feet and other immature actions. 

For the design project, many schedules and project divisions were created. Though at the beginning of the semester, they were equal, as Rachel and Jack did not make their contributions, their original larger assignments were broken up, and parts were re-allocated. Eventually, Lauren and I completed the majority of the project. 

By the end of the project, I asked Rachel and Jack for their contributions (for the 50th time), and they barely had anything. I  then did their contributions for the design that night. 

During this night, however, I did not respond to Rachel's text messages for 4 hours, as she and I had been rude. She then decided to go to our professor who is over our small project, and say that she could not work with me since I do not communicate. 

Not only is this bad for my academic reputation, but that professor is also my boss at work. 

The final straw is that when writing the last portions of the paper I saw Rachel's ""contribution"" list. It included many tasks that she simply did not contribute to, or that she barely contributed to and Lauren I completed. 

The issue is that all 4 of us are about to graduate. Either the teacher only takes Lauren and me a little seriously and drops Rachel and Jack's grades down, or he understands the gravity of the situation and fails them, delaying their graduation. Though I would love the satisfaction of their actions having real consequences, I would feel terribly guilty for delaying someone's graduation. They have already paid for their cap and gowns, made graduation plans, and begun their job search. Additionally being a snitch is kind of an asshole move in the first place.

She doesn’t have a driver’s license yet. She has almost 10k in savings, and gets approximately $900 every two weeks as a paycheck. Rent is $300 every month as we still live with our parents. She is very good about making sure that once money goes in, it doesn’t come out. Our Mothers birthday is coming up, as well as Mother’s Day, and so I wanted to get her an umbrella for her patio. I ran the idea by both her and our dad, and they both agreed to pitch in. It’ll be $65 from each of us. Because she doesn’t have enough in her checking account to pitch in and take Ubers to work, she told our parents that they won’t get rent until the next paycheck. Sometimes this is fine, but there are a few extra bills due this coming month that means they need the extra money (her rent and mine) by the 2nd. She is now saying that either she doesn’t have to pay rent until her next check, or she’s not buying anything for our mom. 
Her saying that she’s is ‘broke’ or has ‘no money’ has caused arguments before, because the rest of us don’t have even close to what she has in savings. My parents and I both have our own bills to pay(I pay for my car and insurance-which eats up a lot bc I can’t work full time due to a disability), so it’s so much harder for us to save 75% of every paycheck. 
And I’m not saying that she shouldn’t save, or that she needs to give others her money, all I’m saying is that taking $65 out of her savings won’t make her unable to purchase a car.
