I know I'm incredibly lucky to have parents who are willing to drive me to and from work, so maybe I should just let them have their fun. 

A couple days ago, I bought a halter top. It wasn't cropped or anything, but the overshirt I wanted to wear with it is a neon yellow mesh hoodie that's cropped right above my chest. It's a style of clothing that I like and I think I look good in. I was feeling confident that day and even took a couple pictures to send to my boyfriend. It wasn't long after that that I had the following interaction with my parents:

Dad: isn't that top a little small?

Mom: oh relax, he's just teasing.

Me: well I wish he would stop.

Dad: [literally fucking laughs and walks away.]

Mom: oh please, I've been through so much already, just throw me this bone. [Also laughing]

Me: I'm not going to throw you a bone if it makes me insecure.

Mom: [starts laughing harder and in a condescending voice] I wish I could afford to be insecure, but I can't. 

I'm nonbinary, born female with a pretty flat chest. I have my ideal body type. However, my parents make these sort of comments about my body and my clothing a lot. Any time they do, it makes me feel gross, weird, uncomfortable, embarrassed, and insecure. It feels as though the only times they don't say anything about my body or clothes is when I'm wearing long sleeves and pants (you can probably guess what summer is like). 

Some added context: we are not religious, my parents are just extremely strict, especially with what I wear and always have been. They still expect me to wear the same style of clothing as I did when I was 10.

1,1chf65b,AITA for telling my online friend that I don’t care about his friends?,"This happened recently and I'm honestly not sure if I'm in the wrong.

So I (19F) met (21M), who we will call Toboe, in 2022 through a video game, a mutual online friend of ours introduced us to each other.

At first, we both didn't like each other. Toboe immediately didn't like me because he saw me as the ""popular kid"" with all the friends. He was never mean to me in-game because I was always surrounded by at least 5+ of my online friends.

I didn't like him because he kept trying to prove me wrong about everything as if I didn't know anything about the game we play.

So when we became friends eventually, we have had a lot of conflict and lots of arguments. He always tries to prove me wrong or say I'm in the wrong.

So, here's what recently happened: 

Toboe and I were arguing about pronouns.

I asked him if he could use they/them or something else in reference to me besides she/her. I often get insecure about my gender being told online and would rather people not know I'm a female online due to harassment I have received.

He got mad at me, saying that I'm not transgender and that I'm born a female IRL so that's what I am unless I come out as transgender.

Toboe has very strict rules when it comes to determining whether or not someone is transgender. If you don't check off his list then you're not transgender.

So, if you're not transgender, you have no right to use another pronoun than the one you're assigned to at birth.

After arguing about it, he claims I treat him unfairly and then he brings his transgender friends into it; saying they find it offensive when regular people treat pronouns like a pair of clothes.

I said that I have my own transgender friends who don't find me using another pronoun as offensive.

Toboe says he doesn't care what my transgender friends think and that he cares what his transgender friends think. Toboe then claims that his transgender friends would rather die than live with people with opinions like mine and my transgender friends.

And I told him I didn't care if his transgender friends died.

Toboe was furious with me after that, saying I'm in the wrong and that I am insensitive, coldhearted, and selfish.

I defended myself; asking him to remember that time he told me in the past that he hopes one of my friends die, and that he would say ""L"" if he learned that friend passed away.

Toboe then claims that my friend deserved being talked about like that because they were rude to him in the past.

I've never met Toboe's transgender friends. They've been ghosting him for years. All of Toboe's friends have been ghosting him for months or years.

Toboe struggles to maintain friendships because of how much he fights with all of them / because of his autism. When I say all of his friends ghosted him, I mean ALL of them.

My friends think I'm NTA, and one of them even said there's a reason he has no friends; another friend said I could've been a bit too harsh.

Toboe hasn't talked to me since.

2,1chcqa1,AITA for quitting my dad’s company,"(Super long post)
I (M26) left my dad’s company.

Three years after high school, my dad hired me into his company due to needing to replace the last guy that left. He didn’t want to hire me, but he was desperate to have someone pick up the slack. I quit my job at the packaging plant and did my work well enough that he kept me on. HR offered me a full time position with the added caveat that I had to also continue to be enrolled in college (dad’s idea). Took the deal because the salary was just good enough to pay for my classes and rent.

It was weird working with my dad. It was fun at times and we got closer, but also more distant. It didn’t matter if it was during or after work hours, I was always his employee. If I ever got in any argument or disagreement with him, no matter how small, he’d threaten to fire me.

Taking vacations and sick days was next to impossible. If I ever called in sick or used a vacation, he would send my mother over to my house to check on me. I had to take my key back from her because she would like to walk in and check if I was really sick. Or she’d call and “warn” me that my dad was upset I took a vacation and my job wasn’t secure anymore.

My job revolved around providing overwatch to assignments in progress regardless of work hours and time zones. So if I got off at 7pm, and one of my assignments is kicking off at 11pm, I would have to stay up to provide instructions/answers/overwatch until the job is complete. There are quite literally only four employees (including myself) to handle these jobs.

Being in college was no excuse. If I had an exam or test after work hours, my dad would threaten to use my vacation time. Work assignments started affecting my sleep, forcing me to go multiple days in a row with only 2 hours under my belt and still expected to come into the office. I couldn’t pass my work to my coworkers because they had the same issues as me. When the company got popular, more work added on. It was a nightmare because they refused to hire more employees.

When time came to sign up for classes again, I simply didn’t. It was impossible for me to do this and school. Before I can talk to my dad about my decision, my brother (who my dad sent to my college) informed him that I haven’t signed up for classes. Got a very angry text that I have three weeks to leave, so I gave my two-weeks to my truly amazing manager and left.

Fiancé has been covering my side of the bills and she’s informed me that she got a pretty big raise to do so comfortably. As soon as we’re officially married, we’re going to try for kids and I’m going to be the stay at home dad.

Parents are disappointed in me. I’m told constantly that I could have had everything and that I’m giving my fiancé too much power. Mom tells me he’s hurt I went behind his back and left the company. Said I should have talked to him before making the decision to drop out.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for quitting my dad’s company (Super long post)

3,1chcggb,AITA for reporting my vehicle as stolen?,"Fake Names Used - Me 21NB: Me - Sister 22F: Paige - Nephew 1M: Luke - Sisters BF 23M: Rory

Currently I live at home, renting a room from my mom.  Paige, Rory, and Luke all live here as well. I was recently able to buy my first car and I haven't been able to drive it yet, because I have a broken ankle. I'm the only one on the registration and I pay for everything.

Paige is really irresponsible with her belongings and has previously stolen from me, she also doesn't have her license yet. Rory has crashed both his mom's car and his car. So when I got my car I told them that nobody but me was driving it. They also both smoke and refuse to wait until we've parked to smoke. They'll start smoking while we're still going, even with Luke present. I don't smoke and don't want anyone to smoke in my vehicle.

They keep asking to borrow it and I've been telling them no each time, which leads to them asking mom and me getting yelled at to let them borrow it. I've been sticking to my guns and not letting them borrow it, despite getting punished for it. I've also been keeping the key on me so they can't take it.

Luke has been sick recently, he had his vaccines and is having a mild reaction. Paige called the doctor and everything was normal. She still wanted to take him to the emergency room. I was out of my room at the time and had the key in my purse, in my room. She decided to grab my key and just go, without even asking me.

I went to take the trash out later and noticed my car missing. I called her and my mom and told them they had 30 minutes to have my vehicle home or I was reporting it stolen, hospital is 15 min away so they would have had time to get it back. I guess they didn't believe me because they didn't show back up with my car. I called the police and my insurance, let them know it was stolen. I told the police what hospital they should be at, and the police showed up. Rory and Paige both got taken into police custody. Luke was picked up by his dad, whose in the middle of a bad divorce with Paige.

I was able to get my car back, thankfully with no new damage. They had definitely smoked in it though, so I had to deep clean it. I decided to drop the charges, no need to make the living situation even worse. However from my understanding the police might still decide to prosecute. I didn't mean to make their life bad, I just wanted my car back. CPS showed up at the house and now it's looking like Paige might lose Luke.

4,1chcef4,AITA for trying to help clean up a store's stock?,"I (21M) work for a relatively large auto retail store. Recently, two management jobs opened up a store in a neighboring city that can help me move up, and obviously, I applied. I spoke with the district manager, and he set me up there as a guest for the store. The ""but"" is I can move things around and help out the store if need be.

When I got there, the back stock was a mess and most of everything there needed to be reset because you could hardly find anything there. None of the planograms in the back were set correctly, so I decided to do some with permission from the district manager and the possible general manager. I also did a couple of other things unrelated to the stock, but the inventory was the majority.

A couple of days ago, one of the employees there had told me that what I did to inventory pissed off a lot of people despite no one saying a word and saying the exact opposite. I had called up the district manager about it and there was only two people who got mad- the one who told me (20sM), and a completely other guy (70sM).

As it turned out, (70sM) was the one who set those planograms despite it not being their job, and (20sM) was mad because I was a ""guest"" in their store and therefore shouldn't have moved the things that I moved. He continued by telling me it's the equivalent of someone going into your house and rearranging the furniture which I totally get. I decided not to argue with him because the position I'm applying for is supposed to oversee all of that anyways.

Here's where I may be the asshole. Today, I was helping another worker fix a planogram that needed fixing and (70sM) walked up to me aggressively and basically demanded that I don't deal with the stock anymore because I'm not supposed to. I told him that I was doing what I was allowed to and I would continue to do so which he walked away angrily. I didn't think much of it and brought it up with a different worker who told me that (70sM) was about to walk out and quit because of what I did.

Because of all that, I was placed on just the register which is making me think that maybe I was wrong, or maybe I shouldn't have helped at all. AITA?

5,1chca32,AITA for saying that my sister's boyfriend is a bum and either he goes or I go?,"Hi. So I (F22) have always had a rocky relationship with my sister ""Alex"" (F34) for multiple reasons. As you can see, we have a fairly large age gap so we haven't been very close growing up.

I live with our parents. I work full-time, contribute towards electric and water and I pay the internet bill. My parents are both immigrants and come from a culture where your kids don't move out until they are married.

Around 3 months ago, Alex moved back into our parents' home with her boyfriend ""Tom"" (M32) and she announced that she was pregnant. They've been together for just under a year. Previously they were staying with Tom's parents but chose to move out as they are having marriage problems and will likely get divorced. 

I (and my parents were too) was under the impression this would be a very temporary thing but they are still here.

Alex was working part-time and had a pretty active social life so she was most often out of the house, although last month has been prescribed bedrest by her doctor.

Tom on the other hand, is unemployed and has been since Christmas. He does the occasional odd job that's cash-based but spends most of his day loudly playing video games or scrolling on his phone. He insists that he is applying for lots of jobs but never hears anything back.

Tom is really bothering me for many reasons but I'll only list the main ones. He never cleans up his own messes or helps out with the housework, in fact I've been doing a lot of his laundry just so it will stop stinking up the house. He's always up late and sometimes wakes the whole house up by screaming at his video games. He has bad personal hygiene, he rarely showers and he stinks. I can never use the living room or fully relax because he's always occupying it to play video games.

I had a serious conversation with my parents and said that I cannot stand living with Tom and I think he's a bum. They told me that although he can be annoying I should be trying to get along with him and he is our family now. The conversation derailed and I basically said either Tom changes his behaviour or goes, or I go.

My mom told Alex and Tom what I said and now they are both furious and this situation is a huge mess. They are both insisting that Tom's behavior is not that bad and I am overreacting, since it's not like he has been mean to me.

The document was a K-1 form, and listed about $3,000 of dividends and interest income attributable to my wife. The document also listed my wife's balance (about $130,000). I assumed that the $130,000 was money held for my wife in a trust, and that the dividends and interest income would be held for her as well. Under this assumption, I gladly paid the taxes ever year.

Earlier this year I learned that my father-in-law plans to use all the funds for a family cabin, and to give joint ownership of the cabin to each of his six kids. My wife and I want nothing to do with joint ownership. We would rarely use the cabin and don't want to owe thousands a year for utilities, maintenance, property taxes, etc. Furthermore, we don't want to deal with the inevitable disputes that would arise between her siblings regarding use of the cabin, who owes what, etc.

At this point my wife and I had paid $6,031 in taxes for the income to be used for the cabin, and I was upset that we were never told the income would be used that way. As I saw it, the cabin was my father-in-law's dream, not ours. I believed he should have paid the taxes on that income, not us.

My wife called my father-in-law to discuss the issue. He told her the funds were not held in a trust, but a Family Limited Partnership (FLP). An FLP is more difficult to get out of than a trust, but he offered to buy her out for $100. Furthermore, he offered to pay us the $6,031 we had paid in taxes. (My wife said he didn't have to.)

Later, I called my father-in-law. I spoke calmly. I told him my wife and I had been hurt by the way the FLP was operated, but that I wanted to be at peace with the situation and move forward with a positive relationship. I asked that he buy my wife out as he offered. I then said that as the one who manages our family's finances, I thought it would be appropriate for him to pay us the $6,031, even though my wife said he didn't have to. Finally, I suggested that he pay cash distributions each year to each of the other five siblings to offset their tax liability. I said that was the expectation of FLP legal experts, per research I had done online.

When we visited my in-laws a few weeks later, he bought my wife out for $100 and wrote her a check for the additional $6,031 in taxes. I didn't discuss the matter at all with them during our visit.

7,1chc5jh,AITA for refusing to pick up my [F23] boyfriend [M25] after he smoked weed?  ,"[Quick update at the end]

So last night my boyfriend came over. After a bit of alone time (I had homework I had to finish) weed was offered to us by my brother. Boyfriend said yes initially, but after my brother has left I asked if he'd reconsider as I'd been really wanting to spend some quality time together (no technology, no substances and no distractions). He agreed and asked if I wanted a cup of tea. 

The kind gesture left me feeling listened to and happy. 15 minutes go by and I get the sinking feeling he's been distracted by something, namely, weed. As I go downstairs to get my tea myself I pass him in the stairwell and I get hit with the smell of weed on his breath. I continue past, and I ask my brother if they'd just smoked together. He said they had, and that boyfriend had said yes to it when it'd been offered to him a second time. I explained the situation and my brother was empathetic. 

Boyfriend and I ended up having a small argument, ending in me explaining that I'm too upset to spend the night with him and that I'm going to drive him home. Once I drop him off I explain we're on a break now, as stuff has been piling up for a while and this was the ""cherry on top"". 

Next morning I get a bunch of messages from him asking me to drive him back to my place so he can get his car. My brother and mother both said he should catch a bus (or walk the downhill hiking track that leads directly from his suburb to mine!) since it was his fuck up that got him in this situation. 

I told him as much, and he told me I'd ""forced him out of the house"", pleaded with me about not ""making him"" spend money to get to his car and explained that me giving him a ride wouldn't jeopardize the break I've put us on. 

I reiterated the reasons why I've put us on a break, and he replied with ""I was [just as] disappointed when you got as upset as you did, but to be fair you didn't really make much of an effort to come and hang out with me last night."" 

To clarify, I'd been busy with homework, he'd put a show on that he'd wanted to finish. When that show was done, he came over, we chatted for like two minutes before weed was offered. Then you know the rest. 

He said a few other things, but there's not enough space for me to quote it. We haven't spoken much at all. 

I'm feeling really confused and frustrated about all this. He's called me several times now but I've ignored them. I don't know if refusing to go get him when he has multiple options to get here himself is a dick move or not. 

AITA? 

TL,DR; asked boyfriend if we could skip smoking weed tonight so we could have quality time together. He agreed, offered a cup of tea, and then ended up smoking weed whilst I was waiting for my tea. We started to argue but I felt so over it all that I ended up driving him home. He wants me to take him to his car but I'm refusing, AITA? 


Update; 

I finished work not too long ago and found him waiting by my car with a smoothie he'd bought for me. And a hand written letter I haven't opened. He then asked me for a lift. He then told me he'd got his PARENTS to drop him there. I asked why he couldn't have asked them to drive him to his own damn car but he couldn't give me an answer. I was so overwhelmed and freaked out I didn't know what to do, but in the end I drove him to mine in silence, and he just thanked me as i walked to my house. I'm so angry. He had the entire day to get to his car. It would have taken him under an hour to bus to mine, under two if he'd walked. I wish I'd just left him at my work, but I don't know if that would really make me an AH

A little backstory, my friends have expressed in the past that they think I'm ignoring them as I've been spending a lot more time with other people. Granted, I kind of was ignoring them, as I had more fun with those other people, but in my eyes, I think I've stepped up my game since then.

So basically, I (M 17) was a bit late to meeting my friends (all M 17) at lunch break today. I had to talk to a few of my teachers about assignments and had to pick up lunch. Point is, I had reasons for being late that weren't stupid. When I got there, my friends were planning a hangout. Chill, right? They were around the beginning-middle of their conversation when I sat down to join them.

Not once did they ask me if I was free to join them all throughout planning this thing. Even though I was right there next to them, they just went on until they moved on to a different topic of conversation, hockey teams. Finally, around 10-ish minutes after they were done planning, and the conversation about hockey died down, did one friend (Dude A) turn to me and ask me if I was free to join them that Friday. WTF??

Now here's where I might've been the asshole. I kinda curtly told them I wasn't free because of baseball practice, and just left to see other friends.

Thinking I don't trust her and called me ""selfish"" and ""ungrateful"" for not giving her my phone and told me to never use her phone again if I wasn't going to let her use mine and said she was going to change her phone's PIN but funny thing is that she ***came*** to me to help her how to change the PIN on her phone right after.

we became good friends and he had confessed to me once but i said i was sorry and dint like him back. Emmera who had liked Apple dint beileve that but we got over it.

Apple texted me with song lyrics he had made. i joked about them (it was along the lines of him wishing he could be with someone) At the time he liked Emmera and i had asked if it was her?  He said no, i had tried to ask many times who but he didn't say. i ignored it until he told it was me, he had joked this a few times but he was serious. he apologized and i informed Emmera and my bf about this. I told him to not talk to me until he lost feelings since it made me uncomfortable.

Timeskip to yesterday, he said he had lost feelings and we became friends again. Emmera was still upset saying i liked him when i didn't. I hadn't minded it though because she dose this alot. She got over it or so i thought. Today at lunch she said, ""I know you like apple so just talk to him or something its so obvious"" I got really pissed, but said calmly ""I dont, please understand that, Neither you or him can understand i have a bf who i seriously care about. we've been through shit and yeah he might not be the best looking but still""  (I dont remeber it fully but along the lines of these) I told my friends later that im getting pissed that she cant understand that just because he likes me dosent mean i like him. Emmera has been pissed about it all day and continues to talk about him and ask if we talk privately. which i said yes because were friends but if she wants to look over the texts she can.

So yeah ive been mad at her and she knows it. But am i the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for getting mad at my friend because she said i liked i guy i didn't? (i thinks thats how you spell did not, istg if my friends find this or my other post im dead)

So my friend and I both work decent jobs, but I make significantly more than her. Over the past year or so of our friendship I’ve given her a good sum of money for gas, food, etc. and never asked for anything in return. In January of this year she asked for money so I gave it and told her to pay me back. It came to a point where I had to beg her for $10 just so I could afford my bills (I’m a waitress and tips were awful that week). Later she takes more money out of my wallet bc she needed cash and couldn’t use her card. I was promised she would pay me back. It’s been almost 5 months.  So anyways, I had been bringing it up every now and again, while still buying her breakfast some mornings just bc it seemed nice and I wasn’t too mad at her yet. She then pays me $10 in cash so I could “calm down”. After bugging her a few more times she tells me she’s going to send me a certain amount, then she never does. Keep in mind she’s always posting about her “shopping hauls” and constantly tells me abt all the purchases she makes. The other day I was talking to two girls about it, and one of them went a told her, which is what I expected. She sent me the $20 and then yelled at me for “taking her last dollar.” I apologized, and said thank you. She then went on about how her family is in a tight spot (even though her family goes on lavish vacations like 4 times a year) and how she only gets $300 bi weekly, yet makes $14/hour and works 20-30 hours a week.

Basically I have finals this week and I have a class that I thought my advisor signed me up for as a blow off class so I hasn’t even gone in months and then I found out I actually need this course as pre-rec for next year. So I have been trying to learn a semester worth of material in three days and have not slept.

 Today was the final and I accidentally smashed into the side of my sister’s car on the way out of the drive way (it didn’t help that she parked like an idiot) it did a lot of damage to both our cars but I was running really late so I just drove on. 

When I turned my phone back on after the test my family group text was going crazy trying to figure out who had hit Eva’s car. By some crazy coincidence our ring cams had stopped working so even the police had come out. 

I chimed in and said that I was sorry I was the one who hit the car. I tried to explain about my final but no one cared. They are so mad at me. When I got home I tried to explain it’s not a big deal because our dad pays our insurance so since it’s the same insurance it’s a write off and it won’t cost us anything.

My sister was crying/screaming at me that she loved that car and had taken such good care of it. I said it would only be a matter of weeks before it was covered in smelly pink drink cups like her old car. She said “you are such a fucking asshole” and stormed off to her room. My dad won’t see it my way either and was even more pissed when he saw all the damage to my car. 

He said he didn’t want to hear another word about my final and he has never been more disappointed in  one of his kids in his entire life and needs a “break” from me.

I text her and she says she has it… this is kinda usual for her to forget or what have you so I was like “ok can you bring both over sometime this week?” She said sure… however almost every other day I ask if she can bring it over that week she says she’s too tired or doesn’t feel like it. Fast forward to the weekend and my thesis is due Monday night. I am getting a MA in art education so I had to make some artwork as well along w my thesis. I have been staying up most nights painting or working on the writing part of my thesis so come Saturday morning I had a huge headache in the morning and decided to take a nap before I began working again. I also had plans that night to go on a date to an improve show that I already paid for. As I am almost asleep I see my sister is calling me… I decide not to answer bc I was already about to sleep anyways. Well no more than 10 minutes later, I do fall asleep but I here my front door open. It wakes me up and freaks me out and I slowly get up to see what’s going on. It’s my sister… and she has this sheepish smile and she just like fake innocently smiles and says “heyyyy”. I am infuriated. Not only was I awoken from my nap and now my headache is even worse from being startled, she uses my house keys that I wanted back a week ago to enter my house!!! I began yelling at her saying that this is not cool and she was crossing boundaries.

I got back to my room to try to sleep again but I can hear she is still here. 5 minutes later she knocks on my door and peeps her head in with another stupid smile. I tell her again how violated I feel and I want her to leave. Anyways she doesn’t and I guess she was hungover so that’s why she came over?? So she is now puking in my toilet super loudly which is right next to my bedroom. Keep in mind she has her own apartment and my parents place only 5 minutes away. She even calls our mom to come pick her up so she could have went to her to begin with! She is also 25 and a grown ass adult and teacher… She wanted me to “comfort her”.

17,1chahi5,AITA for accepting my single mother's wedding gift?,"I come from a family of 3 brothers and I'm the oldest brother. We were raised by a single mother who did her best and worked to the bone to get herself thru university while we were kids. My mom is now a successful and independent professional 58 yr old and us boys are adults ranging from 27-37 all living in Canada.   
I'm the first in my family (including my mom) to be married. I had a happy engagement to my (now) wife and both of our families were involved in healthy ways. As a gift to us, my wife's family paid $10,000 towards the wedding, which covered most of it. My mom offered to pay for an open bar, which we graciously accepted ($800 US dollars).   
Once my middle brother found out we accepted my mother's gift to pay for the bar a switch happened. I didn't know until after, but as we were having our wedding in the USA, he actively stopped trying to renew his passport to attend at this time. He did not tell me. 2 weeks before the wedding he messaged the family group chat advising he was ""too sick"" and ""too poor"" to attend. I messaged and called him right away (to offer to help and/or pay for him to attend) and did not hear from him until 2 days later. He advised our mother owed him money and he was in a rage that she had offered to pay for the bar while owing him. I did not know this at the time of accepting her gift and did not know how to respond.   
I ended up essentially telling him to mind his own business - to give my mom autonomy over her finances and also to stop being tacky (my opinion) and he advised he would not be attending the wedding under these circumstances. My youngest brother stepped up as my best man, my mom was devastated and me and my wife were hurt by his absence. The wedding was still the best day of my life and all other family bonded and came together.   
We are now 6 months after the wedding and my brother and I have still not spoken, except for once around Christmas when I messaged him to clear the air before seeing each other in person and he called me entitled and spoiled and said he would not be attending Christmas if I was there. I went to Christmas anyways, he did not, and we haven't spoken since. AITA for accepting my single mom's gift and how this all went down?   
\*\*\*An interesting aside to this story is my mom never \*actually paid\* for the bar. The invoice was never sent and after many attempts to contact them and pay, they never sent us a bill and have closed down. I've never gotten to tell my brother this, and haven't mentioned it on principle.

I had no problem with this and listened to Alex ramble while I filed my nails when Kevin started giggling at me cause he thought it looked like I was doing an inappropriate hand movement if you catch my drift. I brush it off and say nothing cause I don't care and in the past he's made it clear he hates me and doesn't consider me a sibling, which is fine I feel the same minus the hate part until tonight when he just hung up the call interrupting Alex. of course, Alex calls me back right away and something else is said by Kevin when Alex speaks up being an innocent 6 year old ""but she's my sister"" Kevin replies with sarcasm ""shes not my sister I don't even know her"" I calmly say ""Why don't you mind your business, Alex and I were talking that was rude of you"" ik I come off blunt often, I don't mean to it's just how I talk. now I'm not upset at his next actions but he called over my stepmom and told her I was ""being a b\*tch"" and yelling at him. It's funny how she was sitting right across from them at the table but told him to but out and Alex will call me when I was ""in a better mood.

19,1chaftn,AITA for being unwilling to play Santa? ,"My wife is responsible for events at her job, and one of these events is ""Christmas in July."" This event has been going on for years and is generally well attended. I have helped in years past with serving refreshments and never had any issue doing so. This year she finds herself in a pickle because the person who historically plays Santa at these events unfortunately passed away since least year's event.


I was informed that I would be playing Santa this year (not asked if I would be willing). I had an instant internal reaction to this and was not on board. This led to a bit of a fight where she finally relented with, ""fine, I'll figure something else out"" and I thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later she brought it up again as if I had agreed. I mentioned I thought it was decided she would figure something else out and she said, ""yeah, the something else was I wad going to wait and you would warm up to the idea."" I told her I wasn't happy about that but told her if she had no other options I would do it, but I wasn't thrilled about it.

I am quite large, to the point that rental Santa suits likely would not fit. I'm also concerned about being dressed in velvet and fur for an outdoor event in July. I'm also not the usual demographic, I'm younger than Santas are traditionally. The idea of being in my 30s having random children sit on my lap while I sweat profusely sounds awful. I know there are plenty of people that like the idea of playing Santa. I do not. I explained all this to her and told her I legitimately do not feel comfortable doing this.


For context, this very well may be her last year working in this position, meaning it will be her last time hosting this event. We also have an infant son, for whom this would be his first of these events. 


In response to my explanation of why I don't feel comfortable, both of these facts were brought up as supporting reasons why I should play Santa anyway. She then proceeded to tell me she was hurt that I was unwilling to help her. I told her I'm more than willing to help, and I have volunteered for multiple years at that exact event, but playing Santa wasn't something I wanted to do.


I'm feeling guilty about this, because I hate disappointing her and I know it can't be fun or easy to find someone willing to volunteer to be Santa. I also feel like my issues with doing it are reasonable and defensible.

This event has been going on for years and is generally well attended. I have helped in years past with serving refreshments and never had any issue doing so. This year she finds herself in a pickle because the person who historically plays Santa at these events unfortunately passed away since least year's event.


I was informed that I would be playing Santa this year (not asked if I would be willing). I had an instant internal reaction to this and was not on board. This led to a bit of a fight where she finally relented with, ""fine, I'll figure something else out"" and I thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later she brought it up again as if I had agreed. I mentioned I thought it was decided she would figure something else out and she said, ""yeah, the something else was I wad going to wait and you would warm up to the idea.""

After some self-reflection, I have realized I don't think I am a good suit to be your friend. You are amazing and smart, and this doesn't affect how amazing you are.

We had also planned to go to a concert and had cancelled the day I was about to order tickets. Before this, I had realized that I had been uninvited to many events and began to be increasingly ignored by my friend group of five.

   I was invited to parties after this and everyone has sided with her except for one. I've begun to question if part of the reason is my boyfriend which I highly doubt since he is quiet and rather shy keeping to himself. The large reason I have found this to affect me is my ADHD I tend to not understand social cues and it takes me a long time to unmask and open up to people. Around Christmas of 2023 is where I truly started being myself and that's when I started being pushed away. The most ironic part of this all is one of my friends the rest wanted to quote on quote ""kick out"" and when I called them out they called me crazy. That friend is still in the group and everyone has ignored me and won't explain anything. Maybe I don't deserve an explanation but it's so frustrating.

I've been taking a community college class online to work towards getting an associate's in a field unrelated to my major, but aside from that, I've been job searching and volunteering throughout the week. On weekends I sometimes babysit for a family to make some income, but aside from that, I'm not working or making much of an income.

I help my mom out with anything she asks me to. Getting groceries, picking up/dropping off my little sisters, will drive her for drives as long as 4-5 hour roundtrips as needed. I proofread her work assignments, I've also been helping her with filling out her divorce paperwork, which is time-consuming. This is all to say that I quite literally help her with anything else she asks at the drop of a hat, no matter what it is. My mom is happy to have me home and has always expressed to me that she doesn't want me to move out and needs my help at home.

I can clean the entirety of the kitchen; the dishes, the dining table, the floor, taking out the trash, wiping down the stovetop, the counters, and I kid you not, it will revert back to being extremely messy in 1-2 days.

After about a month of cleaning the kitchen for 1-2 hours each day, I've just been really exhausted from it. In college, I lived with roommates who along with myself kept our place clean all of the time. I've tried explaining to my family that they need to stop creating so much mess everyday and clean after themselves more in the moment, and that I'm demotivated from cleaning, because I don't see the point in doing it if the place will just revert back to being messy the next day anyways. I truly don't contribute to this mess; most days I'm just on my laptop applying to positions, and if I eat something for myself I wash my dish afterwards. The only mess I contribute to is the trash/recycling filling up.

My mom is upset with me because she says it's not fair that everyone goes to school and work all day and I'm home and not cleaning. I understand where she's coming from, but I've tried explaining that I wouldn't be so opposed to cleaning if the mess were just more manageable on a daily basis. The sink is completely full with dishes each day, the stovetop, counters, table and floor always have spices and food spilled all over them, I'm tired of it all. People are creating mess left and right and acting as if I should be the one cleaning it all, and it's not right even if I'm unemployed.

I truly don't contribute to this mess; most days I'm just on my laptop applying to positions, and if I eat something for myself I wash my dish afterwards. The only mess I contribute to is the trash/recycling filling up.

My mom is upset with me because she says it's not fair that everyone goes to school and work all day and I'm home and not cleaning. I understand where she's coming from, but I've tried explaining that I wouldn't be so opposed to cleaning if the mess were just more manageable on a daily basis. The sink is completely full with dishes each day, the stovetop, counters, table and floor always have spices and food spilled all over them, I'm tired of it all. People are creating mess left and right and acting as if I should be the one cleaning it all, and it's not right even if I'm unemployed. I love my family but it's hard for me to live in a messy state and it makes me wish I could get a position sooner so I could go back to living with roommates, but I just can't afford to for now.

28,1ch9oaw,AITAH for not wanting to pay him back ,"AITAH for not wanting to pay him back?

This all took places 2 days ago and were both freshman in highschool.

So it was the end of class and I was sitting on my phone scrolling. I have an, let's call acquaintance, named Gavin(not real name). He came up next to me and we started talking, but then he kept trying to take pictures of me up close and take videos. I kept swatting his phone away and grabbing it to stop him from taking pictures of me. At one point he retracted his phone back and after a second or two I thought he was going to take another one so I swatted the phone down again, but this time the phone fell (3 feet at most) and hit the floor. He picked it up and a large majority of the screen was black and fuzzy. 

Now I see how I could be the asshole since I am the one who smacked the phone down but still. 
More context to help my points as well.
Next day he told me he wants me to pay him 200$ as a way to repay him. 
My issue is
 1. I feel like this is fuck around and find out territory
2. He isn't going to be the one paying for the new phone (he told me this), it will be his grandma (implied he'd use money to repay her)
3. His phone was by itself 200 dollars (iPhone SE gen3) and he's getting a brand new iPhone
4. Being honest I'd probably have given him the money by now if he wasn't being a total asshole about it saying I'm ""indebted"" to him now until I pay him and saying if I ""dont pay him by the 5th, I dont want to know whar will happen"" (joke but still)
5. He said ""I may not even use it for the phone"" which I quickly saw him go ""oh f**k"" in his mind and try to pretend like he didn't say it out loud 
6. Threatening that if I don't his grandma will call the school and I'll get in trouble (i have a clean record and I'm pretty sure this is mostly not my fault)

So in summary am I the asshole for not wanting to pay him $200?

30,1ch9hsr,WIBTA if I didn’t thank my brother for a gift?,"I (34f) posted a while ago about my brother (36m) who constantly gives me passive aggressive bday gifts.

Long story short: my brother acts like he’s better than everyone because he’s religious and the only one of us siblings who had children of his own. For the past several years he refuses to talk to me but has given me passive aggressive bday gifts including discounted Easter candy in a Walmart bag with the receipt showing 70% off and last year got me a fountain pen with no ink where he admitted he didn’t even buy it. Someone gave it to him and he didn’t want it. Him and his wife have ignored me for years while I’ve constantly reached out in attempt to have a relationship with him before finally just going no contact for my own mental health.

I decided this year if he messaged me that he was bringing a gift I was going to tell him not to bother. I didn’t want anymore “gifts” from him. So my brother didn’t call or text or anything. Just showed up at my apartment unannounced, left a generic card on my doorstep, didn’t knock or ring the doorbell or anything. My ring camera caught it. And then he just left. This was at around noon.

So he texted me 6 hours later to let me know that “the mail delivered my bday card”. While I’d love to be just as petty as him, I’m trying to just take the high road. I don’t necessarily want to thank him for doing the absolute bare minimum (if not less).

One day I ended up at his house due to my uncle inviting me to the water park and I accepted not knowing he was going to go, and when he found out he was not happy. He started talking bad about me to my family on his side and I was hurt. The next day we wanted to go somewhere again, so I stayed the night with no words said to him throughout the time. The next day I was washing dishes and playing video games with friends and he says my dish was not washed, but it was. I washed it again and he claimed they were ""still dirty"", so when I tried to come to show him he started abusing me. He did awful things I can’t say but I got brusies. while i'm just 14 not even in highschool and he's 6'3 220 just beating me, it wasn’t fair. He then runs to his car and get his “tool” and aims it at me. I was lost at words and he told me to get out. Since then I removed him out my life. He's got married, a new family, barely talks to my sisters, and just obsessed with my life. This brings me to the present. I'm close to my mom's side, which has my aunt and grandma.

I said I would keep it short and simple to ask him and she tried to stop me claiming she didn't want ""drama"" so i sent it anyway because I felt disrespected. I texted him and he didn't respond and he ended up texting my mother and my mother got mad at me. She told me to not say anything to her and I just said ""ok"" and that was it.

My parents are separated due to my dad cheating on my mom, and since then it's always been back and forth between parents. Me and my dad bumped heads a lot and most of my dads side of the family treated me weird due to me being ""Too Proper"". Anyways it was all good until I was 14. He started bringing multiple females around me and my sisters and I distanced myself. One day I ended up at his house due to my uncle inviting me to the water park and I accepted not knowing he was going to go, and when he found out he was not happy. He started talking bad about me to my family on his side and I was hurt. The next day we wanted to go somewhere again, so I stayed the night with no words said to him throughout the time. The next day I was washing dishes and playing video games with friends and he says my dish was not washed, but it was. I washed it again and he claimed they were ""still dirty"", so when I tried to come to show him he started abusing me. He did awful things I can’t say but I got brusies. while i'm just 14 not even in highschool and he's 6'3 220 just beating me, it wasn’t fair. He then runs to his car and get his “tool” and aims it at me. I was lost at words and he told me to get out. Since then I removed him out my life. He's got married, a new family, barely talks to my sisters, and just obsessed with my life. This brings me to the present. I'm close to my mom's side, which has my aunt and grandma. They understand the story but still tries to push him back into my life saying I should forgive and forget. I have but they don't listen. They continue to talk to him and invite him and tell him about all my events, awards, and life in general. I told them I don't appreciate that multiple times and they don't listen.
Recently I had prom and I took photos of cours check on facebook to see I got tagged in a comment to a post of my dad's of my prom photos. I was pissed and told my mother and she told me to calm down and just manipulate me, ie and play victim. She told me my aunt and grandma wanted to send him pictures but she stopped them but she sent them and gave permission for him to post them. I called her out on her mistake and she says that she's sorry but doesn't plan on fixing it and asking him to take it down. I said I would keep it short and simple to ask him and she tried to stop me claiming she didn't want ""drama"" so i sent it anyway because I felt disrespected. I texted him and he didn't respond and he ended up texting my mother and my mother got mad at me. She told me to not say anything to her and I just said ""ok"" and that was it. That was two days ago and nobody has said a word to me since. I'm thinking about not inviting nobody to my graduation because I feel disrespected. Why should I trust people who can't respect my life, and share all my successes to people not in my life for their own gain?",,-0.012688752,0,0
37,1ch8fer,AITA for giving my brothers cat to his ex?,"My fiancé (32M) and I (31F) live in a two family home with his brother (Adam) and new wife (Martha) as our neighbors.   
  
Before Adam met Martha, he was in a 3 year relationship with Vicky. Together they owned two cats. They ended up breaking up, and Adam kept both cats. A few months later, Adam met Martha and quickly married. They then got a kitten and since then, one of the original cats (Luc) started pooping outside of the litter box. Adam and Martha started leaving Luc outside to “teach him a lesson”.   
  
Whenever I saw this happen, I’d bring Luc into my home until Adam is there to take him back in. The neighbors on our block have also made comments that they’ve seen Luc meowing by their door to be let in at night.  
  
Last week, after I found Luc again, my fiancé asked Adam and Martha in person if they still want the cat since they keep leaving him outside. Verbatim, Martha says “I don’t want that f\*ing cat. He is disgusting”. My fiancé then tells them both that we will give the cat a home. Both Adam and Martha don’t contest.  
  
My fiancé and I then buy all the necessary cat supplies. We decide to house him with intentions of finding him a permanent loving home. After a week, Adam tells me that everything is going well now that Luc is gone. That day, we decide to message Adam’s ex, Vikki, to see if she would like to keep the cat.   
  
We thought that asking Vikki first would be the right thing to do since Luc knows her, and since he was her cat for a period of time. We also know that Vikki is a responsible and loving pet owner. Vikki was a former vet tech. She was so appreciative that we took Luc in, and was thrilled to keep him.  
  
Adam and Martha are upset that we gave the cat to his ex. They dislike our rationale and asked “You couldn’t find anyone else to give the cat to?”

38,1ch83sf,AITA For wanting to Kick My Wife’s Friend Out For Her Veiws,"UPADATE: some one In the comments (sorry can't find your user) made a great point about why not just sell the trailer then. We had just been keeping it for storage but we have already started moving most of the stuff out to accommodate Jane. The trailer at least in my opinion isn't great for living in. I used it as a workshop so it's spartan. So after talking to the wife again. I've decided the best course to keep everyone happy and us protected from Jane's BS is to sell the trailer to her. I'm going to defer the payment until she gets established but I don't really think she will pay nor I'm I too worried about it if she doesn't. I got way more then my money's worth out of that place as a workshop and storage. So if her getting a freebie gets the head of ache of the trailer out of my hair, keeps the wife happy and keeps me from having to play daddy landlord with Jane's antics then I'm pretty ok with that solution. Thanks AITA for your insights and ideals. I will respond to comments as I can and update if  anything else happens.

My wife reconnected with a friend from high school last year. A week ago she asked if we can help Jane because she’s splitting up with her husband and is going to be homeless. I said yes.

So we made a plan Jane would move into a old trailer i own we had been useing for storage and she would stay with us while she finds a job in the area of the trailer and gets the lights and water turned on. The trailer is in a park where i pay rent on the lot each month. We told Jane we would pay for it this month and starting in June she would be responsible for the Lot Rent and keeping the yard kept up but we wouldn’t charge her any rent for the trailer itself. This trailer had been just getting used as storage and I have an older VW bug in the driveway that needs some repairs. I thought about it and decided i was never really going to have time to do it and so I told Jane if she wanted to get that car fixed up she could have it too. 

So Far:

Jane brought a guy into our house we didn’t know and F*cked him so loudly that the neighbors complained(The wife did  aperently tell her she could have a friend over) 

Jane came over with $100 to her name and spent it on non-essentials 

Jane boks are doing any housework ussaly saying she doesn’t know how to

She doesn’t want to fill out job applications and when she does she does it half drunk

There have been other things she’s done I can get into in the comments if people need.

At this point I was getting annoyed with Jane and told my wife I don’t know if this is going to work long term but then today the following happened that made me want to kick her out. But then today I took Jane to see that trailer. Once we were there she acted very grateful and started talking about how she was going to fix it up but then she springs on us that her 1st ex husband was going to move in with her. This weirded me out because she didn’t talk to us about anyone else living there but i figured it’s not my place to say who she can live with. Then she starts talking about selling the furniture in the trailer I didn’t like this and reminded her that its still my trailer were just let her use it she said ok. But then she started talking about selling the VW bug. (I may be the asshole for not likening that because I did say she can have it if she wants but IDK I don’t like the ideal of giving it to her just to sell) On they way back to the apartment she starts talking about the issue with black people and the gays. Me and my wife are very liberal and i did not like this at all. I told her keep talking like that and I’m pulling the car over and dropping you off. This was the straw that made me really want to kick her out. My wife reminded me that the trailer is a bigger head ache for us empty because we have to deal with the lawn and lot rent  and so even though I don’t like Jane its better to have her in there because it means more time and money for us. So let me have it Reddit i kept hitting the character limit so I’ll answer any follow up or context questions as i see them.

39,1ch81t6,AITA for going on vacation and yelling at my father while he was in the ICU?,"I (28F) and my father (48M) have never had the best relationship. I have 3 other siblings that have cut contact, while I have thought about it, I have a sibling that just turned 13 and I have stuck around to be there for them. In December of 2023 I started to plan a cross country vacation for April of 2024.

The Friday before I was supposed to leave (6 days before departure), I got a call on my way to work that my father was in the ICU due to a stroke. I called work let them know I wouldn't be in and drove the 4 hrs to the hospital. I stayed the night and visited 3 more times over the weekend and before I left. I got continuous updates when I wasn't and always called my stepmom and nurses to check in on him when I was not there. He had several complications throughout his stay; another stroke, 2 blood clots, put on a vent and sedated, ect. I had already spent so much money and knew there was nothing I could do sitting there so I decided to go and made a plan to get back early if things took a turn for the worse while I was gone. While on my trip I got a text in the group chat that had been started with other family members to give updates on my father to limit the amount of calls/text for updates when something happens, calling me out for being a terrible daughter for going on vacation while he was still in the ICU. Eventually I called my stepmom to find out what was going on, she proceeds to yell at me even more for not being at the hospital with my father while he is dying. I then hear my father in the background agreeing with her and telling her that I'm a disappointment. I had no idea that he was even off the vent and awake until that phone call. I tried to explain my side, I heard my father say that I am a B\*tch and worthless just like my mother. 

I calmly asked if I was on speaker phone, I was. I then proceeded to explain that I am the only sibling minus the youngest that is still around and that's because she lives with him. I drove 4 hrs multiple times to be there and was still getting updates on his condition the whole time and that after years of mental and physical a\*use when I was younger, he is lucky that I talk to him. If he really wanted to push it, I would take him to court for custody of my little sister and it wouldn't be hard to do since he lost custody of his other 4 kids before she was ever born and she has told me on multiple occasions that she would rather live with me anyways, before handing up the phone. I have been dropped from the group and told that until I apologize, I would not be able speak/see my little sister. Everyone else has continued to blow up my phone telling me that I'm a horrible person to say any of that while he was still in the ICU and demanding that I say sorry, or they are cutting me off as well.
