I know I'm incredibly lucky to have parents who are willing to drive me to and from work, so maybe I should just let them have their fun. 

A couple days ago, I bought a halter top. It wasn't cropped or anything, but the overshirt I wanted to wear with it is a neon yellow mesh hoodie that's cropped right above my chest. It's a style of clothing that I like and I think I look good in. I was feeling confident that day and even took a couple pictures to send to my boyfriend. It wasn't long after that that I had the following interaction with my parents:

Dad: isn't that top a little small?

Mom: oh relax, he's just teasing.

Me: well I wish he would stop.

Dad: [literally fucking laughs and walks away.]

Mom: oh please, I've been through so much already, just throw me this bone. [Also laughing]

Me: I'm not going to throw you a bone if it makes me insecure.

Mom: [starts laughing harder and in a condescending voice] I wish I could afford to be insecure, but I can't. 

I'm nonbinary, born female with a pretty flat chest. I have my ideal body type. However, my parents make these sort of comments about my body and my clothing a lot. Any time they do, it makes me feel gross, weird, uncomfortable, embarrassed, and insecure. It feels as though the only times they don't say anything about my body or clothes is when I'm wearing long sleeves and pants (you can probably guess what summer is like). 

Some added context: we are not religious, my parents are just extremely strict, especially with what I wear and always have been. They still expect me to wear the same style of clothing as I did when I was 10.

1,1chf65b,AITA for telling my online friend that I don’t care about his friends?,"This happened recently and I'm honestly not sure if I'm in the wrong.

So I (19F) met (21M), who we will call Toboe, in 2022 through a video game, a mutual online friend of ours introduced us to each other.

At first, we both didn't like each other. Toboe immediately didn't like me because he saw me as the ""popular kid"" with all the friends. He was never mean to me in-game because I was always surrounded by at least 5+ of my online friends.

I didn't like him because he kept trying to prove me wrong about everything as if I didn't know anything about the game we play.

So when we became friends eventually, we have had a lot of conflict and lots of arguments. He always tries to prove me wrong or say I'm in the wrong.

So, here's what recently happened: 

Toboe and I were arguing about pronouns.

I asked him if he could use they/them or something else in reference to me besides she/her. I often get insecure about my gender being told online and would rather people not know I'm a female online due to harassment I have received.

He got mad at me, saying that I'm not transgender and that I'm born a female IRL so that's what I am unless I come out as transgender.

Toboe has very strict rules when it comes to determining whether or not someone is transgender. If you don't check off his list then you're not transgender.

So, if you're not transgender, you have no right to use another pronoun than the one you're assigned to at birth.

After arguing about it, he claims I treat him unfairly and then he brings his transgender friends into it; saying they find it offensive when regular people treat pronouns like a pair of clothes.

I said that I have my own transgender friends who don't find me using another pronoun as offensive.

Toboe says he doesn't care what my transgender friends think and that he cares what his transgender friends think. Toboe then claims that his transgender friends would rather die than live with people with opinions like mine and my transgender friends.

And I told him I didn't care if his transgender friends died.

Toboe was furious with me after that, saying I'm in the wrong and that I am insensitive, coldhearted, and selfish.

I defended myself; asking him to remember that time he told me in the past that he hopes one of my friends die, and that he would say ""L"" if he learned that friend passed away.

Toboe then claims that my friend deserved being talked about like that because they were rude to him in the past.

I've never met Toboe's transgender friends. They've been ghosting him for years. All of Toboe's friends have been ghosting him for months or years.

Toboe struggles to maintain friendships because of how much he fights with all of them / because of his autism. When I say all of his friends ghosted him, I mean ALL of them.

My friends think I'm NTA, and one of them even said there's a reason he has no friends; another friend said I could've been a bit too harsh.

Toboe hasn't talked to me since.

2,1chcqa1,AITA for quitting my dad’s company,"(Super long post)
I (M26) left my dad’s company.

Three years after high school, my dad hired me into his company due to needing to replace the last guy that left. He didn’t want to hire me, but he was desperate to have someone pick up the slack. I quit my job at the packaging plant and did my work well enough that he kept me on. HR offered me a full time position with the added caveat that I had to also continue to be enrolled in college (dad’s idea). Took the deal because the salary was just good enough to pay for my classes and rent.

It was weird working with my dad. It was fun at times and we got closer, but also more distant. It didn’t matter if it was during or after work hours, I was always his employee. If I ever got in any argument or disagreement with him, no matter how small, he’d threaten to fire me.

Taking vacations and sick days was next to impossible. If I ever called in sick or used a vacation, he would send my mother over to my house to check on me. I had to take my key back from her because she would like to walk in and check if I was really sick. Or she’d call and “warn” me that my dad was upset I took a vacation and my job wasn’t secure anymore.

My job revolved around providing overwatch to assignments in progress regardless of work hours and time zones. So if I got off at 7pm, and one of my assignments is kicking off at 11pm, I would have to stay up to provide instructions/answers/overwatch until the job is complete. There are quite literally only four employees (including myself) to handle these jobs.

Being in college was no excuse. If I had an exam or test after work hours, my dad would threaten to use my vacation time. Work assignments started affecting my sleep, forcing me to go multiple days in a row with only 2 hours under my belt and still expected to come into the office. I couldn’t pass my work to my coworkers because they had the same issues as me. When the company got popular, more work added on. It was a nightmare because they refused to hire more employees.

When time came to sign up for classes again, I simply didn’t. It was impossible for me to do this and school. Before I can talk to my dad about my decision, my brother (who my dad sent to my college) informed him that I haven’t signed up for classes. Got a very angry text that I have three weeks to leave, so I gave my two-weeks to my truly amazing manager and left.

Fiancé has been covering my side of the bills and she’s informed me that she got a pretty big raise to do so comfortably. As soon as we’re officially married, we’re going to try for kids and I’m going to be the stay at home dad.

Parents are disappointed in me. I’m told constantly that I could have had everything and that I’m giving my fiancé too much power. Mom tells me he’s hurt I went behind his back and left the company. Said I should have talked to him before making the decision to drop out.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for quitting my dad’s company (Super long post)

3,1chcggb,AITA for reporting my vehicle as stolen?,"Fake Names Used - Me 21NB: Me - Sister 22F: Paige - Nephew 1M: Luke - Sisters BF 23M: Rory

Currently I live at home, renting a room from my mom.  Paige, Rory, and Luke all live here as well. I was recently able to buy my first car and I haven't been able to drive it yet, because I have a broken ankle. I'm the only one on the registration and I pay for everything.

Paige is really irresponsible with her belongings and has previously stolen from me, she also doesn't have her license yet. Rory has crashed both his mom's car and his car. So when I got my car I told them that nobody but me was driving it. They also both smoke and refuse to wait until we've parked to smoke. They'll start smoking while we're still going, even with Luke present. I don't smoke and don't want anyone to smoke in my vehicle.

They keep asking to borrow it and I've been telling them no each time, which leads to them asking mom and me getting yelled at to let them borrow it. I've been sticking to my guns and not letting them borrow it, despite getting punished for it. I've also been keeping the key on me so they can't take it.

Luke has been sick recently, he had his vaccines and is having a mild reaction. Paige called the doctor and everything was normal. She still wanted to take him to the emergency room. I was out of my room at the time and had the key in my purse, in my room. She decided to grab my key and just go, without even asking me.

I went to take the trash out later and noticed my car missing. I called her and my mom and told them they had 30 minutes to have my vehicle home or I was reporting it stolen, hospital is 15 min away so they would have had time to get it back. I guess they didn't believe me because they didn't show back up with my car. I called the police and my insurance, let them know it was stolen. I told the police what hospital they should be at, and the police showed up. Rory and Paige both got taken into police custody. Luke was picked up by his dad, whose in the middle of a bad divorce with Paige.

I was able to get my car back, thankfully with no new damage. They had definitely smoked in it though, so I had to deep clean it. I decided to drop the charges, no need to make the living situation even worse. However from my understanding the police might still decide to prosecute. I didn't mean to make their life bad, I just wanted my car back. CPS showed up at the house and now it's looking like Paige might lose Luke.

4,1chcef4,AITA for trying to help clean up a store's stock?,"I (21M) work for a relatively large auto retail store. Recently, two management jobs opened up a store in a neighboring city that can help me move up, and obviously, I applied. I spoke with the district manager, and he set me up there as a guest for the store. The ""but"" is I can move things around and help out the store if need be.

When I got there, the back stock was a mess and most of everything there needed to be reset because you could hardly find anything there. None of the planograms in the back were set correctly, so I decided to do some with permission from the district manager and the possible general manager. I also did a couple of other things unrelated to the stock, but the inventory was the majority.

A couple of days ago, one of the employees there had told me that what I did to inventory pissed off a lot of people despite no one saying a word and saying the exact opposite. I had called up the district manager about it and there was only two people who got mad- the one who told me (20sM), and a completely other guy (70sM).

As it turned out, (70sM) was the one who set those planograms despite it not being their job, and (20sM) was mad because I was a ""guest"" in their store and therefore shouldn't have moved the things that I moved. He continued by telling me it's the equivalent of someone going into your house and rearranging the furniture which I totally get. I decided not to argue with him because the position I'm applying for is supposed to oversee all of that anyways.

Here's where I may be the asshole. Today, I was helping another worker fix a planogram that needed fixing and (70sM) walked up to me aggressively and basically demanded that I don't deal with the stock anymore because I'm not supposed to. I told him that I was doing what I was allowed to and I would continue to do so which he walked away angrily. I didn't think much of it and brought it up with a different worker who told me that (70sM) was about to walk out and quit because of what I did.

Because of all that, I was placed on just the register which is making me think that maybe I was wrong, or maybe I shouldn't have helped at all. AITA?

5,1chca32,AITA for saying that my sister's boyfriend is a bum and either he goes or I go?,"Hi. So I (F22) have always had a rocky relationship with my sister ""Alex"" (F34) for multiple reasons. As you can see, we have a fairly large age gap so we haven't been very close growing up.

I live with our parents. I work full-time, contribute towards electric and water and I pay the internet bill. My parents are both immigrants and come from a culture where your kids don't move out until they are married.

Around 3 months ago, Alex moved back into our parents' home with her boyfriend ""Tom"" (M32) and she announced that she was pregnant. They've been together for just under a year. Previously they were staying with Tom's parents but chose to move out as they are having marriage problems and will likely get divorced. 

I (and my parents were too) was under the impression this would be a very temporary thing but they are still here.

Alex was working part-time and had a pretty active social life so she was most often out of the house, although last month has been prescribed bedrest by her doctor.

Tom on the other hand, is unemployed and has been since Christmas. He does the occasional odd job that's cash-based but spends most of his day loudly playing video games or scrolling on his phone. He insists that he is applying for lots of jobs but never hears anything back.

Tom is really bothering me for many reasons but I'll only list the main ones. He never cleans up his own messes or helps out with the housework, in fact I've been doing a lot of his laundry just so it will stop stinking up the house. He's always up late and sometimes wakes the whole house up by screaming at his video games. He has bad personal hygiene, he rarely showers and he stinks. I can never use the living room or fully relax because he's always occupying it to play video games.

I had a serious conversation with my parents and said that I cannot stand living with Tom and I think he's a bum. They told me that although he can be annoying I should be trying to get along with him and he is our family now. The conversation derailed and I basically said either Tom changes his behaviour or goes, or I go.

My mom told Alex and Tom what I said and now they are both furious and this situation is a huge mess. They are both insisting that Tom's behavior is not that bad and I am overreacting, since it's not like he has been mean to me.

The document was a K-1 form, and listed about $3,000 of dividends and interest income attributable to my wife. The document also listed my wife's balance (about $130,000). I assumed that the $130,000 was money held for my wife in a trust, and that the dividends and interest income would be held for her as well. Under this assumption, I gladly paid the taxes ever year.

Earlier this year I learned that my father-in-law plans to use all the funds for a family cabin, and to give joint ownership of the cabin to each of his six kids. My wife and I want nothing to do with joint ownership. We would rarely use the cabin and don't want to owe thousands a year for utilities, maintenance, property taxes, etc. Furthermore, we don't want to deal with the inevitable disputes that would arise between her siblings regarding use of the cabin, who owes what, etc.

At this point my wife and I had paid $6,031 in taxes for the income to be used for the cabin, and I was upset that we were never told the income would be used that way. As I saw it, the cabin was my father-in-law's dream, not ours. I believed he should have paid the taxes on that income, not us.

My wife called my father-in-law to discuss the issue. He told her the funds were not held in a trust, but a Family Limited Partnership (FLP). An FLP is more difficult to get out of than a trust, but he offered to buy her out for $100. Furthermore, he offered to pay us the $6,031 we had paid in taxes. (My wife said he didn't have to.)

Later, I called my father-in-law. I spoke calmly. I told him my wife and I had been hurt by the way the FLP was operated, but that I wanted to be at peace with the situation and move forward with a positive relationship. I asked that he buy my wife out as he offered. I then said that as the one who manages our family's finances, I thought it would be appropriate for him to pay us the $6,031, even though my wife said he didn't have to. Finally, I suggested that he pay cash distributions each year to each of the other five siblings to offset their tax liability. I said that was the expectation of FLP legal experts, per research I had done online.

When we visited my in-laws a few weeks later, he bought my wife out for $100 and wrote her a check for the additional $6,031 in taxes. I didn't discuss the matter at all with them during our visit.

7,1chc5jh,AITA for refusing to pick up my [F23] boyfriend [M25] after he smoked weed?  ,"[Quick update at the end]

So last night my boyfriend came over. After a bit of alone time (I had homework I had to finish) weed was offered to us by my brother. Boyfriend said yes initially, but after my brother has left I asked if he'd reconsider as I'd been really wanting to spend some quality time together (no technology, no substances and no distractions). He agreed and asked if I wanted a cup of tea. 

The kind gesture left me feeling listened to and happy. 15 minutes go by and I get the sinking feeling he's been distracted by something, namely, weed. As I go downstairs to get my tea myself I pass him in the stairwell and I get hit with the smell of weed on his breath. I continue past, and I ask my brother if they'd just smoked together. He said they had, and that boyfriend had said yes to it when it'd been offered to him a second time. I explained the situation and my brother was empathetic. 

Boyfriend and I ended up having a small argument, ending in me explaining that I'm too upset to spend the night with him and that I'm going to drive him home. Once I drop him off I explain we're on a break now, as stuff has been piling up for a while and this was the ""cherry on top"". 

Next morning I get a bunch of messages from him asking me to drive him back to my place so he can get his car. My brother and mother both said he should catch a bus (or walk the downhill hiking track that leads directly from his suburb to mine!) since it was his fuck up that got him in this situation. 

I told him as much, and he told me I'd ""forced him out of the house"", pleaded with me about not ""making him"" spend money to get to his car and explained that me giving him a ride wouldn't jeopardize the break I've put us on. 

I reiterated the reasons why I've put us on a break, and he replied with ""I was [just as] disappointed when you got as upset as you did, but to be fair you didn't really make much of an effort to come and hang out with me last night."" 

To clarify, I'd been busy with homework, he'd put a show on that he'd wanted to finish. When that show was done, he came over, we chatted for like two minutes before weed was offered. Then you know the rest. 

He said a few other things, but there's not enough space for me to quote it. We haven't spoken much at all. 

I'm feeling really confused and frustrated about all this. He's called me several times now but I've ignored them. I don't know if refusing to go get him when he has multiple options to get here himself is a dick move or not. 

AITA? 

TL,DR; asked boyfriend if we could skip smoking weed tonight so we could have quality time together. He agreed, offered a cup of tea, and then ended up smoking weed whilst I was waiting for my tea. We started to argue but I felt so over it all that I ended up driving him home. He wants me to take him to his car but I'm refusing, AITA? 


Update; 

I finished work not too long ago and found him waiting by my car with a smoothie he'd bought for me. And a hand written letter I haven't opened. He then asked me for a lift. He then told me he'd got his PARENTS to drop him there. I asked why he couldn't have asked them to drive him to his own damn car but he couldn't give me an answer. I was so overwhelmed and freaked out I didn't know what to do, but in the end I drove him to mine in silence, and he just thanked me as i walked to my house. I'm so angry. He had the entire day to get to his car. It would have taken him under an hour to bus to mine, under two if he'd walked. I wish I'd just left him at my work, but I don't know if that would really make me an AH

A little backstory, my friends have expressed in the past that they think I'm ignoring them as I've been spending a lot more time with other people. Granted, I kind of was ignoring them, as I had more fun with those other people, but in my eyes, I think I've stepped up my game since then.

So basically, I (M 17) was a bit late to meeting my friends (all M 17) at lunch break today. I had to talk to a few of my teachers about assignments and had to pick up lunch. Point is, I had reasons for being late that weren't stupid. When I got there, my friends were planning a hangout. Chill, right? They were around the beginning-middle of their conversation when I sat down to join them.

Not once did they ask me if I was free to join them all throughout planning this thing. Even though I was right there next to them, they just went on until they moved on to a different topic of conversation, hockey teams. Finally, around 10-ish minutes after they were done planning, and the conversation about hockey died down, did one friend (Dude A) turn to me and ask me if I was free to join them that Friday. WTF??

Now here's where I might've been the asshole. I kinda curtly told them I wasn't free because of baseball practice, and just left to see other friends.

Thinking I don't trust her and called me ""selfish"" and ""ungrateful"" for not giving her my phone and told me to never use her phone again if I wasn't going to let her use mine and said she was going to change her phone's PIN but funny thing is that she ***came*** to me to help her how to change the PIN on her phone right after.

we became good friends and he had confessed to me once but i said i was sorry and dint like him back. Emmera who had liked Apple dint beileve that but we got over it.

Apple texted me with song lyrics he had made. i joked about them (it was along the lines of him wishing he could be with someone) At the time he liked Emmera and i had asked if it was her?  He said no, i had tried to ask many times who but he didn't say. i ignored it until he told it was me, he had joked this a few times but he was serious. he apologized and i informed Emmera and my bf about this. I told him to not talk to me until he lost feelings since it made me uncomfortable.

Timeskip to yesterday, he said he had lost feelings and we became friends again. Emmera was still upset saying i liked him when i didn't. I hadn't minded it though because she dose this alot. She got over it or so i thought. Today at lunch she said, ""I know you like apple so just talk to him or something its so obvious"" I got really pissed, but said calmly ""I dont, please understand that, Neither you or him can understand i have a bf who i seriously care about. we've been through shit and yeah he might not be the best looking but still""  (I dont remeber it fully but along the lines of these) I told my friends later that im getting pissed that she cant understand that just because he likes me dosent mean i like him. Emmera has been pissed about it all day and continues to talk about him and ask if we talk privately. which i said yes because were friends but if she wants to look over the texts she can.

So yeah ive been mad at her and she knows it. But am i the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for getting mad at my friend because she said i liked i guy i didn't? (i thinks thats how you spell did not, istg if my friends find this or my other post im dead)

So my friend and I both work decent jobs, but I make significantly more than her. Over the past year or so of our friendship I’ve given her a good sum of money for gas, food, etc. and never asked for anything in return. In January of this year she asked for money so I gave it and told her to pay me back. It came to a point where I had to beg her for $10 just so I could afford my bills (I’m a waitress and tips were awful that week). Later she takes more money out of my wallet bc she needed cash and couldn’t use her card. I was promised she would pay me back. It’s been almost 5 months.  So anyways, I had been bringing it up every now and again, while still buying her breakfast some mornings just bc it seemed nice and I wasn’t too mad at her yet. She then pays me $10 in cash so I could “calm down”. After bugging her a few more times she tells me she’s going to send me a certain amount, then she never does. Keep in mind she’s always posting about her “shopping hauls” and constantly tells me abt all the purchases she makes. The other day I was talking to two girls about it, and one of them went a told her, which is what I expected. She sent me the $20 and then yelled at me for “taking her last dollar.” I apologized, and said thank you. She then went on about how her family is in a tight spot (even though her family goes on lavish vacations like 4 times a year) and how she only gets $300 bi weekly, yet makes $14/hour and works 20-30 hours a week.

Basically I have finals this week and I have a class that I thought my advisor signed me up for as a blow off class so I hasn’t even gone in months and then I found out I actually need this course as pre-rec for next year. So I have been trying to learn a semester worth of material in three days and have not slept.

 Today was the final and I accidentally smashed into the side of my sister’s car on the way out of the drive way (it didn’t help that she parked like an idiot) it did a lot of damage to both our cars but I was running really late so I just drove on. 

When I turned my phone back on after the test my family group text was going crazy trying to figure out who had hit Eva’s car. By some crazy coincidence our ring cams had stopped working so even the police had come out. 

I chimed in and said that I was sorry I was the one who hit the car. I tried to explain about my final but no one cared. They are so mad at me. When I got home I tried to explain it’s not a big deal because our dad pays our insurance so since it’s the same insurance it’s a write off and it won’t cost us anything.

My sister was crying/screaming at me that she loved that car and had taken such good care of it. I said it would only be a matter of weeks before it was covered in smelly pink drink cups like her old car. She said “you are such a fucking asshole” and stormed off to her room. My dad won’t see it my way either and was even more pissed when he saw all the damage to my car. 

He said he didn’t want to hear another word about my final and he has never been more disappointed in  one of his kids in his entire life and needs a “break” from me.

I text her and she says she has it… this is kinda usual for her to forget or what have you so I was like “ok can you bring both over sometime this week?” She said sure… however almost every other day I ask if she can bring it over that week she says she’s too tired or doesn’t feel like it. Fast forward to the weekend and my thesis is due Monday night. I am getting a MA in art education so I had to make some artwork as well along w my thesis. I have been staying up most nights painting or working on the writing part of my thesis so come Saturday morning I had a huge headache in the morning and decided to take a nap before I began working again. I also had plans that night to go on a date to an improve show that I already paid for. As I am almost asleep I see my sister is calling me… I decide not to answer bc I was already about to sleep anyways. Well no more than 10 minutes later, I do fall asleep but I here my front door open. It wakes me up and freaks me out and I slowly get up to see what’s going on. It’s my sister… and she has this sheepish smile and she just like fake innocently smiles and says “heyyyy”. I am infuriated. Not only was I awoken from my nap and now my headache is even worse from being startled, she uses my house keys that I wanted back a week ago to enter my house!!! I began yelling at her saying that this is not cool and she was crossing boundaries.

I got back to my room to try to sleep again but I can hear she is still here. 5 minutes later she knocks on my door and peeps her head in with another stupid smile. I tell her again how violated I feel and I want her to leave. Anyways she doesn’t and I guess she was hungover so that’s why she came over?? So she is now puking in my toilet super loudly which is right next to my bedroom. Keep in mind she has her own apartment and my parents place only 5 minutes away. She even calls our mom to come pick her up so she could have went to her to begin with! She is also 25 and a grown ass adult and teacher… She wanted me to “comfort her”.

17,1chahi5,AITA for accepting my single mother's wedding gift?,"I come from a family of 3 brothers and I'm the oldest brother. We were raised by a single mother who did her best and worked to the bone to get herself thru university while we were kids. My mom is now a successful and independent professional 58 yr old and us boys are adults ranging from 27-37 all living in Canada.   
I'm the first in my family (including my mom) to be married. I had a happy engagement to my (now) wife and both of our families were involved in healthy ways. As a gift to us, my wife's family paid $10,000 towards the wedding, which covered most of it. My mom offered to pay for an open bar, which we graciously accepted ($800 US dollars).   
Once my middle brother found out we accepted my mother's gift to pay for the bar a switch happened. I didn't know until after, but as we were having our wedding in the USA, he actively stopped trying to renew his passport to attend at this time. He did not tell me. 2 weeks before the wedding he messaged the family group chat advising he was ""too sick"" and ""too poor"" to attend. I messaged and called him right away (to offer to help and/or pay for him to attend) and did not hear from him until 2 days later. He advised our mother owed him money and he was in a rage that she had offered to pay for the bar while owing him. I did not know this at the time of accepting her gift and did not know how to respond.   
I ended up essentially telling him to mind his own business - to give my mom autonomy over her finances and also to stop being tacky (my opinion) and he advised he would not be attending the wedding under these circumstances. My youngest brother stepped up as my best man, my mom was devastated and me and my wife were hurt by his absence. The wedding was still the best day of my life and all other family bonded and came together.   
We are now 6 months after the wedding and my brother and I have still not spoken, except for once around Christmas when I messaged him to clear the air before seeing each other in person and he called me entitled and spoiled and said he would not be attending Christmas if I was there. I went to Christmas anyways, he did not, and we haven't spoken since. AITA for accepting my single mom's gift and how this all went down?   
\*\*\*An interesting aside to this story is my mom never \*actually paid\* for the bar. The invoice was never sent and after many attempts to contact them and pay, they never sent us a bill and have closed down. I've never gotten to tell my brother this, and haven't mentioned it on principle.

I had no problem with this and listened to Alex ramble while I filed my nails when Kevin started giggling at me cause he thought it looked like I was doing an inappropriate hand movement if you catch my drift. I brush it off and say nothing cause I don't care and in the past he's made it clear he hates me and doesn't consider me a sibling, which is fine I feel the same minus the hate part until tonight when he just hung up the call interrupting Alex. of course, Alex calls me back right away and something else is said by Kevin when Alex speaks up being an innocent 6 year old ""but she's my sister"" Kevin replies with sarcasm ""shes not my sister I don't even know her"" I calmly say ""Why don't you mind your business, Alex and I were talking that was rude of you"" ik I come off blunt often, I don't mean to it's just how I talk. now I'm not upset at his next actions but he called over my stepmom and told her I was ""being a b\*tch"" and yelling at him. It's funny how she was sitting right across from them at the table but told him to but out and Alex will call me when I was ""in a better mood.

19,1chaftn,AITA for being unwilling to play Santa? ,"My wife is responsible for events at her job, and one of these events is ""Christmas in July."" This event has been going on for years and is generally well attended. I have helped in years past with serving refreshments and never had any issue doing so. This year she finds herself in a pickle because the person who historically plays Santa at these events unfortunately passed away since least year's event.


I was informed that I would be playing Santa this year (not asked if I would be willing). I had an instant internal reaction to this and was not on board. This led to a bit of a fight where she finally relented with, ""fine, I'll figure something else out"" and I thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later she brought it up again as if I had agreed. I mentioned I thought it was decided she would figure something else out and she said, ""yeah, the something else was I wad going to wait and you would warm up to the idea."" I told her I wasn't happy about that but told her if she had no other options I would do it, but I wasn't thrilled about it.

I am quite large, to the point that rental Santa suits likely would not fit. I'm also concerned about being dressed in velvet and fur for an outdoor event in July. I'm also not the usual demographic, I'm younger than Santas are traditionally. The idea of being in my 30s having random children sit on my lap while I sweat profusely sounds awful. I know there are plenty of people that like the idea of playing Santa. I do not. I explained all this to her and told her I legitimately do not feel comfortable doing this.


For context, this very well may be her last year working in this position, meaning it will be her last time hosting this event. We also have an infant son, for whom this would be his first of these events. 


In response to my explanation of why I don't feel comfortable, both of these facts were brought up as supporting reasons why I should play Santa anyway. She then proceeded to tell me she was hurt that I was unwilling to help her. I told her I'm more than willing to help, and I have volunteered for multiple years at that exact event, but playing Santa wasn't something I wanted to do.


I'm feeling guilty about this, because I hate disappointing her and I know it can't be fun or easy to find someone willing to volunteer to be Santa. I also feel like my issues with doing it are reasonable and defensible.

This event has been going on for years and is generally well attended. I have helped in years past with serving refreshments and never had any issue doing so. This year she finds herself in a pickle because the person who historically plays Santa at these events unfortunately passed away since least year's event.


I was informed that I would be playing Santa this year (not asked if I would be willing). I had an instant internal reaction to this and was not on board. This led to a bit of a fight where she finally relented with, ""fine, I'll figure something else out"" and I thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later she brought it up again as if I had agreed. I mentioned I thought it was decided she would figure something else out and she said, ""yeah, the something else was I wad going to wait and you would warm up to the idea.""

After some self-reflection, I have realized I don't think I am a good suit to be your friend. You are amazing and smart, and this doesn't affect how amazing you are.

We had also planned to go to a concert and had cancelled the day I was about to order tickets. Before this, I had realized that I had been uninvited to many events and began to be increasingly ignored by my friend group of five.

   I was invited to parties after this and everyone has sided with her except for one. I've begun to question if part of the reason is my boyfriend which I highly doubt since he is quiet and rather shy keeping to himself. The large reason I have found this to affect me is my ADHD I tend to not understand social cues and it takes me a long time to unmask and open up to people. Around Christmas of 2023 is where I truly started being myself and that's when I started being pushed away. The most ironic part of this all is one of my friends the rest wanted to quote on quote ""kick out"" and when I called them out they called me crazy. That friend is still in the group and everyone has ignored me and won't explain anything. Maybe I don't deserve an explanation but it's so frustrating.

I've been taking a community college class online to work towards getting an associate's in a field unrelated to my major, but aside from that, I've been job searching and volunteering throughout the week. On weekends I sometimes babysit for a family to make some income, but aside from that, I'm not working or making much of an income.

I help my mom out with anything she asks me to. Getting groceries, picking up/dropping off my little sisters, will drive her for drives as long as 4-5 hour roundtrips as needed. I proofread her work assignments, I've also been helping her with filling out her divorce paperwork, which is time-consuming. This is all to say that I quite literally help her with anything else she asks at the drop of a hat, no matter what it is. My mom is happy to have me home and has always expressed to me that she doesn't want me to move out and needs my help at home.

I can clean the entirety of the kitchen; the dishes, the dining table, the floor, taking out the trash, wiping down the stovetop, the counters, and I kid you not, it will revert back to being extremely messy in 1-2 days.

After about a month of cleaning the kitchen for 1-2 hours each day, I've just been really exhausted from it. In college, I lived with roommates who along with myself kept our place clean all of the time. I've tried explaining to my family that they need to stop creating so much mess everyday and clean after themselves more in the moment, and that I'm demotivated from cleaning, because I don't see the point in doing it if the place will just revert back to being messy the next day anyways. I truly don't contribute to this mess; most days I'm just on my laptop applying to positions, and if I eat something for myself I wash my dish afterwards. The only mess I contribute to is the trash/recycling filling up.

My mom is upset with me because she says it's not fair that everyone goes to school and work all day and I'm home and not cleaning. I understand where she's coming from, but I've tried explaining that I wouldn't be so opposed to cleaning if the mess were just more manageable on a daily basis. The sink is completely full with dishes each day, the stovetop, counters, table and floor always have spices and food spilled all over them, I'm tired of it all. People are creating mess left and right and acting as if I should be the one cleaning it all, and it's not right even if I'm unemployed.

I truly don't contribute to this mess; most days I'm just on my laptop applying to positions, and if I eat something for myself I wash my dish afterwards. The only mess I contribute to is the trash/recycling filling up.

My mom is upset with me because she says it's not fair that everyone goes to school and work all day and I'm home and not cleaning. I understand where she's coming from, but I've tried explaining that I wouldn't be so opposed to cleaning if the mess were just more manageable on a daily basis. The sink is completely full with dishes each day, the stovetop, counters, table and floor always have spices and food spilled all over them, I'm tired of it all. People are creating mess left and right and acting as if I should be the one cleaning it all, and it's not right even if I'm unemployed. I love my family but it's hard for me to live in a messy state and it makes me wish I could get a position sooner so I could go back to living with roommates, but I just can't afford to for now.

28,1ch9oaw,AITAH for not wanting to pay him back ,"AITAH for not wanting to pay him back?

This all took places 2 days ago and were both freshman in highschool.

So it was the end of class and I was sitting on my phone scrolling. I have an, let's call acquaintance, named Gavin(not real name). He came up next to me and we started talking, but then he kept trying to take pictures of me up close and take videos. I kept swatting his phone away and grabbing it to stop him from taking pictures of me. At one point he retracted his phone back and after a second or two I thought he was going to take another one so I swatted the phone down again, but this time the phone fell (3 feet at most) and hit the floor. He picked it up and a large majority of the screen was black and fuzzy. 

Now I see how I could be the asshole since I am the one who smacked the phone down but still. 
More context to help my points as well.
Next day he told me he wants me to pay him 200$ as a way to repay him. 
My issue is
 1. I feel like this is fuck around and find out territory
2. He isn't going to be the one paying for the new phone (he told me this), it will be his grandma (implied he'd use money to repay her)
3. His phone was by itself 200 dollars (iPhone SE gen3) and he's getting a brand new iPhone
4. Being honest I'd probably have given him the money by now if he wasn't being a total asshole about it saying I'm ""indebted"" to him now until I pay him and saying if I ""dont pay him by the 5th, I dont want to know whar will happen"" (joke but still)
5. He said ""I may not even use it for the phone"" which I quickly saw him go ""oh f**k"" in his mind and try to pretend like he didn't say it out loud 
6. Threatening that if I don't his grandma will call the school and I'll get in trouble (i have a clean record and I'm pretty sure this is mostly not my fault)

So in summary am I the asshole for not wanting to pay him $200?

30,1ch9hsr,WIBTA if I didn’t thank my brother for a gift?,"I (34f) posted a while ago about my brother (36m) who constantly gives me passive aggressive bday gifts.

Long story short: my brother acts like he’s better than everyone because he’s religious and the only one of us siblings who had children of his own. For the past several years he refuses to talk to me but has given me passive aggressive bday gifts including discounted Easter candy in a Walmart bag with the receipt showing 70% off and last year got me a fountain pen with no ink where he admitted he didn’t even buy it. Someone gave it to him and he didn’t want it. Him and his wife have ignored me for years while I’ve constantly reached out in attempt to have a relationship with him before finally just going no contact for my own mental health.

I decided this year if he messaged me that he was bringing a gift I was going to tell him not to bother. I didn’t want anymore “gifts” from him. So my brother didn’t call or text or anything. Just showed up at my apartment unannounced, left a generic card on my doorstep, didn’t knock or ring the doorbell or anything. My ring camera caught it. And then he just left. This was at around noon.

So he texted me 6 hours later to let me know that “the mail delivered my bday card”. While I’d love to be just as petty as him, I’m trying to just take the high road. I don’t necessarily want to thank him for doing the absolute bare minimum (if not less).

One day I ended up at his house due to my uncle inviting me to the water park and I accepted not knowing he was going to go, and when he found out he was not happy. He started talking bad about me to my family on his side and I was hurt. The next day we wanted to go somewhere again, so I stayed the night with no words said to him throughout the time. The next day I was washing dishes and playing video games with friends and he says my dish was not washed, but it was. I washed it again and he claimed they were ""still dirty"", so when I tried to come to show him he started abusing me. He did awful things I can’t say but I got brusies. while i'm just 14 not even in highschool and he's 6'3 220 just beating me, it wasn’t fair. He then runs to his car and get his “tool” and aims it at me. I was lost at words and he told me to get out. Since then I removed him out my life. He's got married, a new family, barely talks to my sisters, and just obsessed with my life. This brings me to the present. I'm close to my mom's side, which has my aunt and grandma.

I said I would keep it short and simple to ask him and she tried to stop me claiming she didn't want ""drama"" so i sent it anyway because I felt disrespected. I texted him and he didn't respond and he ended up texting my mother and my mother got mad at me. She told me to not say anything to her and I just said ""ok"" and that was it.

My parents are separated due to my dad cheating on my mom, and since then it's always been back and forth between parents. Me and my dad bumped heads a lot and most of my dads side of the family treated me weird due to me being ""Too Proper"". Anyways it was all good until I was 14. He started bringing multiple females around me and my sisters and I distanced myself. One day I ended up at his house due to my uncle inviting me to the water park and I accepted not knowing he was going to go, and when he found out he was not happy. He started talking bad about me to my family on his side and I was hurt. The next day we wanted to go somewhere again, so I stayed the night with no words said to him throughout the time. The next day I was washing dishes and playing video games with friends and he says my dish was not washed, but it was. I washed it again and he claimed they were ""still dirty"", so when I tried to come to show him he started abusing me. He did awful things I can’t say but I got brusies. while i'm just 14 not even in highschool and he's 6'3 220 just beating me, it wasn’t fair. He then runs to his car and get his “tool” and aims it at me. I was lost at words and he told me to get out. Since then I removed him out my life. He's got married, a new family, barely talks to my sisters, and just obsessed with my life. This brings me to the present. I'm close to my mom's side, which has my aunt and grandma. They understand the story but still tries to push him back into my life saying I should forgive and forget. I have but they don't listen. They continue to talk to him and invite him and tell him about all my events, awards, and life in general. I told them I don't appreciate that multiple times and they don't listen.
Recently I had prom and I took photos of cours check on facebook to see I got tagged in a comment to a post of my dad's of my prom photos. I was pissed and told my mother and she told me to calm down and just manipulate me, ie and play victim. She told me my aunt and grandma wanted to send him pictures but she stopped them but she sent them and gave permission for him to post them. I called her out on her mistake and she says that she's sorry but doesn't plan on fixing it and asking him to take it down. I said I would keep it short and simple to ask him and she tried to stop me claiming she didn't want ""drama"" so i sent it anyway because I felt disrespected. I texted him and he didn't respond and he ended up texting my mother and my mother got mad at me. She told me to not say anything to her and I just said ""ok"" and that was it. That was two days ago and nobody has said a word to me since. I'm thinking about not inviting nobody to my graduation because I feel disrespected. Why should I trust people who can't respect my life, and share all my successes to people not in my life for their own gain?",,-0.012688752,0,0
37,1ch8fer,AITA for giving my brothers cat to his ex?,"My fiancé (32M) and I (31F) live in a two family home with his brother (Adam) and new wife (Martha) as our neighbors.   
  
Before Adam met Martha, he was in a 3 year relationship with Vicky. Together they owned two cats. They ended up breaking up, and Adam kept both cats. A few months later, Adam met Martha and quickly married. They then got a kitten and since then, one of the original cats (Luc) started pooping outside of the litter box. Adam and Martha started leaving Luc outside to “teach him a lesson”.   
  
Whenever I saw this happen, I’d bring Luc into my home until Adam is there to take him back in. The neighbors on our block have also made comments that they’ve seen Luc meowing by their door to be let in at night.  
  
Last week, after I found Luc again, my fiancé asked Adam and Martha in person if they still want the cat since they keep leaving him outside. Verbatim, Martha says “I don’t want that f\*ing cat. He is disgusting”. My fiancé then tells them both that we will give the cat a home. Both Adam and Martha don’t contest.  
  
My fiancé and I then buy all the necessary cat supplies. We decide to house him with intentions of finding him a permanent loving home. After a week, Adam tells me that everything is going well now that Luc is gone. That day, we decide to message Adam’s ex, Vikki, to see if she would like to keep the cat.   
  
We thought that asking Vikki first would be the right thing to do since Luc knows her, and since he was her cat for a period of time. We also know that Vikki is a responsible and loving pet owner. Vikki was a former vet tech. She was so appreciative that we took Luc in, and was thrilled to keep him.  
  
Adam and Martha are upset that we gave the cat to his ex. They dislike our rationale and asked “You couldn’t find anyone else to give the cat to?”

38,1ch83sf,AITA For wanting to Kick My Wife’s Friend Out For Her Veiws,"UPADATE: some one In the comments (sorry can't find your user) made a great point about why not just sell the trailer then. We had just been keeping it for storage but we have already started moving most of the stuff out to accommodate Jane. The trailer at least in my opinion isn't great for living in. I used it as a workshop so it's spartan. So after talking to the wife again. I've decided the best course to keep everyone happy and us protected from Jane's BS is to sell the trailer to her. I'm going to defer the payment until she gets established but I don't really think she will pay nor I'm I too worried about it if she doesn't. I got way more then my money's worth out of that place as a workshop and storage. So if her getting a freebie gets the head of ache of the trailer out of my hair, keeps the wife happy and keeps me from having to play daddy landlord with Jane's antics then I'm pretty ok with that solution. Thanks AITA for your insights and ideals. I will respond to comments as I can and update if  anything else happens.

My wife reconnected with a friend from high school last year. A week ago she asked if we can help Jane because she’s splitting up with her husband and is going to be homeless. I said yes.

So we made a plan Jane would move into a old trailer i own we had been useing for storage and she would stay with us while she finds a job in the area of the trailer and gets the lights and water turned on. The trailer is in a park where i pay rent on the lot each month. We told Jane we would pay for it this month and starting in June she would be responsible for the Lot Rent and keeping the yard kept up but we wouldn’t charge her any rent for the trailer itself. This trailer had been just getting used as storage and I have an older VW bug in the driveway that needs some repairs. I thought about it and decided i was never really going to have time to do it and so I told Jane if she wanted to get that car fixed up she could have it too. 

So Far:

Jane brought a guy into our house we didn’t know and F*cked him so loudly that the neighbors complained(The wife did  aperently tell her she could have a friend over) 

Jane came over with $100 to her name and spent it on non-essentials 

Jane boks are doing any housework ussaly saying she doesn’t know how to

She doesn’t want to fill out job applications and when she does she does it half drunk

There have been other things she’s done I can get into in the comments if people need.

At this point I was getting annoyed with Jane and told my wife I don’t know if this is going to work long term but then today the following happened that made me want to kick her out. But then today I took Jane to see that trailer. Once we were there she acted very grateful and started talking about how she was going to fix it up but then she springs on us that her 1st ex husband was going to move in with her. This weirded me out because she didn’t talk to us about anyone else living there but i figured it’s not my place to say who she can live with. Then she starts talking about selling the furniture in the trailer I didn’t like this and reminded her that its still my trailer were just let her use it she said ok. But then she started talking about selling the VW bug. (I may be the asshole for not likening that because I did say she can have it if she wants but IDK I don’t like the ideal of giving it to her just to sell) On they way back to the apartment she starts talking about the issue with black people and the gays. Me and my wife are very liberal and i did not like this at all. I told her keep talking like that and I’m pulling the car over and dropping you off. This was the straw that made me really want to kick her out. My wife reminded me that the trailer is a bigger head ache for us empty because we have to deal with the lawn and lot rent  and so even though I don’t like Jane its better to have her in there because it means more time and money for us. So let me have it Reddit i kept hitting the character limit so I’ll answer any follow up or context questions as i see them.

39,1ch81t6,AITA for going on vacation and yelling at my father while he was in the ICU?,"I (28F) and my father (48M) have never had the best relationship. I have 3 other siblings that have cut contact, while I have thought about it, I have a sibling that just turned 13 and I have stuck around to be there for them. In December of 2023 I started to plan a cross country vacation for April of 2024.

The Friday before I was supposed to leave (6 days before departure), I got a call on my way to work that my father was in the ICU due to a stroke. I called work let them know I wouldn't be in and drove the 4 hrs to the hospital. I stayed the night and visited 3 more times over the weekend and before I left. I got continuous updates when I wasn't and always called my stepmom and nurses to check in on him when I was not there. He had several complications throughout his stay; another stroke, 2 blood clots, put on a vent and sedated, ect. I had already spent so much money and knew there was nothing I could do sitting there so I decided to go and made a plan to get back early if things took a turn for the worse while I was gone. While on my trip I got a text in the group chat that had been started with other family members to give updates on my father to limit the amount of calls/text for updates when something happens, calling me out for being a terrible daughter for going on vacation while he was still in the ICU. Eventually I called my stepmom to find out what was going on, she proceeds to yell at me even more for not being at the hospital with my father while he is dying. I then hear my father in the background agreeing with her and telling her that I'm a disappointment. I had no idea that he was even off the vent and awake until that phone call. I tried to explain my side, I heard my father say that I am a B\*tch and worthless just like my mother. 

I calmly asked if I was on speaker phone, I was. I then proceeded to explain that I am the only sibling minus the youngest that is still around and that's because she lives with him. I drove 4 hrs multiple times to be there and was still getting updates on his condition the whole time and that after years of mental and physical a\*use when I was younger, he is lucky that I talk to him. If he really wanted to push it, I would take him to court for custody of my little sister and it wouldn't be hard to do since he lost custody of his other 4 kids before she was ever born and she has told me on multiple occasions that she would rather live with me anyways, before handing up the phone. I have been dropped from the group and told that until I apologize, I would not be able speak/see my little sister. Everyone else has continued to blow up my phone telling me that I'm a horrible person to say any of that while he was still in the ICU and demanding that I say sorry, or they are cutting me off as well.

I would've cleaned the garage myself, but I only have one bin in there and my step dad is very particular about his things, so I've done what I could on my own. The ticket is only $40 btw. He's complaining that he doesn't have the money for it. And I'll add that my mom and I worked all day to clean the garage and could fit her car in there and he is still dissatisfied. 

He keeps saying that I should pay because he pays the mortgage and I should accept it because I decided to get the car knowing we didn't have room. So AITA?",0.0,0.039954766631126404,0,1
43,1ci0jry,AITA for leaving my friend at prom?,"Myself (18F) and my two friends, whom I'll refer to as Sam and Kyle (both 18F), had been planning to attend prom for two months. Kyle invited Sam to be her guest since she's homeschooled. To include our friend July (17F), who opted not to go to prom, we decided to have a sleepover.

During the week of prom, we were busy making dinner reservations and gathering groceries for the sleepover. However, on the day of the sleepover, Kyle abruptly decided she didn't want to attend, citing that the ""vibes for prom were already ruined."" Despite our attempts to persuade her, she kept giving different excuses, so we eventually gave up

Then, she proposed that if we invited her friend Ryan (17M) to dinner, she would join the sleepover because he had been ditched by another friend, Cam (18F). Sam wasn't keen on the idea since Ryan tended to gossip a lot, and in the past, Kyle would only talk to Ryan in group settings. However, Kyle quickly withdrew her suggestion, and we proceeded to dinner.

During dinner, Kyle remained glued to her phone and mainly discussed how Cam was a bad friend. She even refused to eat the meal she had chosen. Towards the end, she announced she was meeting Ryan for pictures at 7. We offered to drive her and meet them for pictures afterward, to which she said no before leaving.

Sam and I took pictures at the park and then left. Kyle later texted us while I was driving, suggesting we meet up. We informed her that we had already left and were near Sam's house, but we could meet at prom instead.

Upon arriving at prom, we waited for Kyle and attempted to call her, but she didn't answer. Eventually, she arrived with Ryan and Cam. Throughout the night, she barely interacted with us, causing Sam to feel abandoned and upset. Consequently, we left an hour before the end of prom.

Upon reaching Sam's house, I decided to text Kyle about my feelings, expressing that I felt ditched and that if she had preferred to spend time with her other friends, she should have communicated that to us. In response, she cursed at me, stating she hated me and demanded I never speak to her again. She accused me of ruining her prom and mentioned she had spent a lot on an unpleasant meal because of us. She then asked me to block her, which I did, feeling both angry and shocked.

Now, Kyle and her friends are claiming that our decision to leave was disrespectful and that we were in the wrong. However, Kyle never informed me that I was her ride, as she had made last-minute plans.

44,1ci0jql,AITA for not giving my mother back the money for my wedding?,"Last year me(25F) and my partner (25M) got engaged and we will get married next in February.

We are both recently graduate students, so we are not that stable financially (I'm doing my PhD and he is working, we have a fairly good income,but nothing too extravagant).

I was raised in a really wealthy family that is currently (sometimes) supporting us with money for school, vacations, etc. 

My fiance is an orphan, so he is solely supporting himself. We initially wanted a small ceremony we could afford, but my family insisted we do something big (I've always wanted a bit of a more extra wedding, but didn't mind at all having something small and intimate) that they will 100% cover. We were super thankful for this opportunity, obviously.

Now, we live in a more traditional region (don't know if that's what everybody does) and people usually have the parents name on the invitation. I presented the invitations to my mother (I, for obvious reasons, did not include that parents rubric). She freaked out, wanting her and my father's name to be on it. I explained to her it wouldn't be appropriate to do it, since my partner does not have any family besides me, but she stated that we can add...his passed parents. I freaked out and went home.

Apparently she called my fiance and made this entire scene. He is a really kind and nonconflictual person and said he doesn't really care about invitations, so we can do it the way nu mother wants to avoid any big argument.

I refused, but eventually I sent my immediate family and some of their close friends those disgusting ass invitations, and sent normal ones to everybody else.

Somehow my mother found out about the other invitations and came over to my house. She yelled and threw a tantrum and told us that she is not paying for anything. We already paid much of the wedding off, but she now wants us to return her money.

I refused, called her a bad word I'm ashamed to share here (not my best moment) and sent her home.

Now all my family (besides my dad and sister) threaten to not come, call and argue with me and say I'm being a selfish ass for not ""letting my mother who is paying have at least this little wish"". My mother constantly comes over, demanding her money back, but I don't plan on doing so.

Edit and more context: My partener was raised in a children's home, he did not ""meet"" his parents, he does not have any memories whatsoever.  I know how he feels about them, like they are strangers, and he is not attached to the idea of his parents. He told me we normally wouldn't put the names there (it's just random to put some names he doesn't have any connection with on his wedding invite), but because he knows my family and how they would react, he doesn't mind making this compromise. I did not disrespect his wishes or anything like that.

Update: Thank you all for the suggestions. I talked to my dad (my mother won't speak to me, just through dad) and we decided putting a little note in gift baskets among the lines ""mrs and mr x have the pleasure to host todays wedding of daughter y and x"".

45,1ci0c2w,AITA for Wanting to Move Out for University?,"Hey Reddit,

I (18F) am feeling conflicted and could really use some advice. I recently graduated from school and was thrilled to get accepted into my dream university. However, my excitement quickly turned to despair when I realized that my parents refuse to support my education simply because I'm a girl, despite having supported my older brother financially for university.

Here's the situation: My parents paid for my brother's entire university education without hesitation. They covered his tuition, accommodation, and living expenses. But when I asked them about supporting me for university, they told me that they wouldn't because, as a girl, my future is to get married and settle down, not to pursue a career.

To make matters worse, my brother (23M) has been completely unsupportive. He echoed our parents' beliefs, telling me to accept their decision and not make a fuss. His lack of empathy has been hurtful, especially since I've always looked up to him.

Last night, I finally confronted my parents about their unfair treatment. The argument escalated quickly, with my mum insisting that it's a waste of money to educate girls beyond secondary school. My dad supported her, saying they've already invested enough in my upbringing and now it's time for me to focus on being a good wife and mother.

I couldn't hold back my tears as I tried to reason with them, explaining my passion for learning and my desire to have a career. But they were unmoved, dismissing my aspirations as frivolous.

Now, here's the real issue: My parents are well-off, which means I don't qualify for financial aid or student loans. They also refuse to let me get a job to save up for university, insisting that I stay home to help with household chores until I'm ready to start a family. It feels like they're forcing me into a traditional role that I never wanted for myself.

I'm torn between pursuing my dreams and keeping the peace within my family. On one hand, I want to stand up for myself and move out to attend university against their wishes. On the other hand, I wouldn't want to upset my family.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for Wanting to Move Out for University? Hey Reddit,

We have attempted to be more than friends but I thought it wouldn't work out so I declined but he still has feelings for me. but we do flirt and say I love you and hold hands too. but he said something to me recently that has me reconsidering being friends with him:

so yesterday I reached out to him because I was feeling overwhelmed with school.

we normally call at night to talk, and he was helping me and telling me everything will be fine.

then after a while we were watching a move together, he jokingly said there was a guy who wanted to talk to me. And I jokingly said give me his Instagram.

then he was like no and then when I probed further, he was like drop it.

then I asked him to help me find a guy like a boyfriend and asked him for tips and that's when he started being mean. like said I needed to lose 30 pounds change my skin color and tbh I took it as a joke and then he was like you need to stop being manipulated easily. And mentioned like 2 days ago when we were at the park, he was like hugging touching me but not so inappropriate.

and that's basically what got to me. like this happened yesterday when I was feeling so bad because of school stress and I felt like instead of helping me he said stuff that hurt me, and don't be easy to manipulate was what got to me.

like he never said that to me before and it was so specific. so, I ended up blocking him and he texted me on snap and I blocked him there and he send me an apology video, created another snap account and send me apology messages, and send more apology messages on Instagram, email, snap.

and I saw and was like thank you for apologizing but now I don't really know how to approach this.

And when i confronted him about what he said he said it was a joke and never thinks of me that way and that he loves me and still has feelings for me and that I he can't live life without me. my problem is like he is a good guy and treats me so kindly and nicely and he was joking when he said those things, or it started as one and escalated but I am not okay with it.

and the fact that he said I was easy to manipulate got to me.

and we did end up talking about it today and he apologized and said that he said it randomly and that he had no intentions behind it. but I don't know what to do because every time I see him I can't seem to forget what he said.

any advice will be appreciated!

edit1:

I have told my guy best friend that I do not want to be more than friends and he accepts that and has claimed to be okay with whatever I want. He has stuck to honoring my bounderies but sometimes he and I both find ourselves in a situation that put us back into flirting phase over and over again.

edit2:

I know some of you are saying he wants to get me in bed. I have considered that but I know for a fact he isn't because of some other situation I am not gonna name here.

edit3:

I do admit that what I am doing with allowing things to happen and flirting while also declining is leading him o. I don't know what to do because we have had lets just be friends conversation over and over again. To the point I had considered going no contact for a month so all feelings can die down. But every time I bring it up, he is against it because he believes that he will be able to just be friends with me knowing that he has feelings for me. Like regardless of whatever I do or say, he goes along with it and just wants to be friends even after I told him that nothing more than friends can happen between us. Like he is satisfied as long as we are still talking and in no way pushes me to do things that make me uncomfortable.

edit4:

So I have had another conversation with him about it, and he is adamant that he is good with being friends only. He also said that I was never stringing him along after I asked him about it. I suggested no contact for a while or going our separate ways, he said he doesn't want that. He said that if he feels like I am leading him on he will let me know, and said that he has already moved on as in no longer likes me like that. I also told him no more flirting, kissing, hugging, and holding hands. He said fine to all but objected to hugging and said I was taking it way too deep.

At twenty one I got a job abroad moved and two mounts after that I stopped accepting his calls (he never called before I moved), I feel suffocated each time I see a message or a call from him, am I the asshole for cutting contact with him.

50,1chzpow,AITA for asking SIL to take down video of my animals,"I (22f) live on my family farm and recently my brother (32m) divorced his wife and got remarried (33f) and moved back to the farm in a 5th wheel. Legally speaking, he has no claim to the place, its only me and one parent. Funny enough, that's not even the problem I'm in.

I have 3 horses and a flock of sheep, and I just had my first ever lambs, one I'm bottle feeding. I am so protective over all my animals which is a very well known fact about me. For example, I live where winters can get well below freezing and I have to haul water by hand for all of them daily. I do the daily chores, pay for their needs and everything. My new sister in law has been sneaking around my horses, telling people about them and inviting them over to ""meet them"" like they belong to her. She's also been sending her kids in to play with the bottle baby, pick him up and whatever else, specifically when I'm not home. I have asked them before to not do this, and if they want to spend time with them, they need to ask me otherwise it's dangerous and can put both them and the animals at risk, and that its a standard boundary for horse owners. I've only been met with anger, gaslighting and backlash. She has also been very judgemental and makes degrading remarks. 

A week ago, she took a video of one of the lambs and posted it all around, didn't ask or tell me about it and it was the final straw. I asked around to other friends and family if i should ask her to take it down and they said it wouldnt hurt to try and they can understand that I feel used. I asked a couple days ago for her, nicely, to take it down only on Tiktok mostly because the hard work I've done and the hardships I've gone through makes it feel like a slap in the face that she'd try and get tiktok views out of it. I didn't complain about anywhere else, i specified Tiktok since I can get over it being on FB for friends and family, although I would have prefered her ask or tag me. She gave me the nastiest passive aggressive response, how she thought sending me the video first meant I could post it too (i dont understand that logic if someone could explain that to me) and she didnt even know i was on tiktok. 

Since, she's been rallying the rest of the family against me and making awful claims on her FB and just being petty. This morning, she made a super vague and cryptic one that says ""people keep her under thumb and keep control of her life."" I do try my hardest to be understanding and avoid being unreasonable, and i have kept my mouth shut about tons of things that upset me just to keep peace and avoid conflict, but trying to get views from the fruits of my labour bothered me so much. 

I understand she took the video and strangers could do the same, plus its only a video but its different to me when a family member does it. A part of me feels like I'm overreacting, but another feels like speaking up now can prevent problems in the future.

51,1chzlsr,AITA for creating separate Netflix profiles,"Long time lurker (43f). Vicariously-lurking partner (44m) suggested I post this here.

Netflix finally cut off our access to a friend's account (honestly surprised we got away with it this long as she lives on a different continent let alone a different household) (we were paying her half the subscription fee, so not assholes there). I therefore created our own account, and transferred over our profile.

With free reign over the account I then decided to also add separate individual profiles for myself, him and our cat-sitter. For clarity, our existing shared profile stays as-is for shared viewing.

I removed my own individual titles from our list and added them to my own profile, then suggested he do the same. Suggested - not demanded nor started the process for him.

This to me would be helpful for moments of wondering what to watch alone by having the options clearly there, rather than our need in the past to check in advance of solo tv nights or having to message each other while one of us is out. I also assume this is what most people do who haven't been piggy-backing on a friend's account.

He says I'm an asshole for causing unnecessary disruption and extra work (""Hassle of having to move between profiles when one was working perfectly well for me""). He'd like you to know that he does the primary workload of the searching through Netflix to add titles, and this is adding to his admin.

I think he's making a mountain out of a molehill, and that his 'admin' is something he does voluntarily. I also think next time he's out and can't remember if I did or didn't want to watch something he'd be grateful for the list. And have said that if he doesn't go along with the system then I don't want him asking me 5 times about the same show.

We both think this is probably too small and pretty for AITA but you can be the judge of that LOL. But he things he's right to be annoyed and that reddit can be the neutral adjudicators.

Strangely he didn't call me an asshole for making his profile picture Regé-Jean Page as the Duke.

52,1chzlox,AITA for ‘literally’ breaking my mother's heart,"I (34M) am at a crossroads with my mom (55F).

Things started going south with my mom around the time I moved out when I was 20. That's also when I started dating my now-wife (34F). Relevant: When I proposed to my fiancé, my mother called, sobbing. After an hour-long call, she said, “It’s either her or me!” Nothing I said convinced my mom I loved her, and the call ended with us both in tears.

Since moving out, Mom has missed some big milestones. She bailed on my college graduation and blamed it on drama with my wife's family. Later, she blamed her anxiety. That same drama resulted in us eloping. When invited to our wedding reception, she claimed “exclusion through inclusion” and then didn't show up, later claiming food poisoning for her, my father, and brother (the only family I have in my life). This year, she confessed there was no food poisoning. Instead, she claimed Dad drove her and my brother to the reception, and they left because of her anxiety.

She apologizes after these events, but she also flips things to make me feel guilty for putting pressure on her to attend. She likes using the silent treatment or avoidance as a means to solve issues as she “tries to find the right words”.

Our conversations are minefields. They almost always end up being about her. She has health problems she refuses to properly treat, expecting everyone else to adapt to her needs instead of seeking help. She has acid reflux, and because it has gone untreated for years, she has difficulty eating most foods and now it is on everyone else to find and cook recipes she can eat. She is able bodied. She also refuses to keep a food diary or see a doctor and will lie about what she eats before eventually tattling on herself. She gets annoyed by conversations around food now since she has limited options.

Example: Wife asked how reducing sugar had gone. Mom claimed she cut it out completely. During dinner, Mom talked about having ice cream (‘for the acid’) and chai tea that week. - Calling her out doesn’t go well, and my wife didn’t really care what she ate, she just hoped my mother had found something to help with her diet.

One of the worst fights occurred recently. I had grown out my facial hair, and she criticized me, calling me a “hobo” and other names. This kicked off an hours-long argument. It’s like my appearance and choices are up for debate. After arguments, I’m left feeling like a bad son. She has ended phone calls before saying “You don’t love me”.

My wife no longer speaks to my family, resulting in the text to me, “You're literally breaking our hearts.” As requested, via email, I sent her a list of the experiences and behaviors I’ve struggled with over the last 14 years. Her response had little empathy followed by half-apologies and excuses.

After her response, I feel like I might be the AH for siding with my wife about her, and for sending her a list of grievances, even though she requested it.

53,1chzl31,AITAH for canceling a trip gifted to me by my boss?,"My job is incredibly stressful. My boss is the reason why.

I do all of his work for him. He doesn't show up to work even a whole day in a given week and expects me to run his business for him. I've been doing this for 7 years now.

The list of what I do for his is too long to list for Reddit but it's been explained to me that I do the work of 5 different people.

The pay is...okay. I'm lucky to have my husband's income because I wouldn't be able to survive on mine alone. I've wanted to quit this job so many times.

But I can't because my boss wants to retire and sell the business to myself and 2 other people, one of them being my husband (he works here too). The other person (lets call him Nathan) is someone we do not like and do not get along with. He only cares that he makes as much money as possible without doing any work.

My boss emphasized he needed me on board because I'm essential to the running of the business and that I didn't have to worry about sharing w/ Nathan because ownership would be split evenly so my husband and I would have majority ownership to make decisions.

Since the potential of owning the business is something we want, we've spent weekends and evenings coming up with business acquisition plans and we've been doing the legwork to make this sale happen.

So, my boss took off on vacation for the past 5 months. I ran the office while he was away. When he came back, he decided that for my efforts, he would give me and my husband a trip. He wanted us to drive 6 hours to a location on Friday, stay the weekend, drive back on Monday and be to work on Tuesday.

Not much time off and we'd pay for gas and food but it was a nice gesture so we took it and thanked him for it.

Then we had an office meeting. He mentioned he's now decided myself and my husband are to be one entity for the purposes of ownership so that we didn't have the option to overrule the authority of Nathan. So essentially, we would own 25% each and Nathan would own 50%.

It was a smack in the face.

Not only have I worked my veritable ass off for him so he can go on 5-month-long vacations and not worry, but my husband has been picking up the slack of Nathan's ineptitude to keep everything running as well. We've been the ones coming forward with all of the business sale ideas and we've been the ones really trying to make this work.

Because of that, my husband and I started to feel like the time off he was giving us was more of a bribe than anything else to keep us around and accept whatever trash deal he put forward. We thought about it and came to the decision that we didn't want to go anymore. It felt dirty.

I canceled the reservation for the place he was sending us and broke down in tears. This was going to be the first time off I've had in years and I didn't realize how much it meant to me till now.

Nelly told us that without her we could not check in early or use the hotel parking, so we use da public space 5 min from hotel. After some time, she called to let us know they were almost there, and to wait at the car so they can show us to hotel parking. But after half an hour, there was still noone there and noone was answering texts or calls. 

Matt head to the hotel to see if they are there. When he came back, he explained that there was an issue with the booking and they didn't have enough rooms and someone would have to stay at another hotel. And they decided it would be me and Bella and Nelly was waiting for me to show me to the other hotel. One thing you need to know here: I'm currently getting tested for autism. One of my ""worst traits"" is that I have difficulty with spontanious change and even then, people knew that (minus autism test)

Nelly tried to say that the other hotel is nicer because she felt my negativity, and I tried to explain that I don't care, and why of all people it had to be me, when they know I have the hardest time adapting, but she stayed silent. Belly was already waiting, and immediatly comforted me since she knew this could end really bad for me. She also told me the others decided it should be me because I was not there to argue which only hightened my anxiety. I took a shower, and we talked while getting ready which lead us to be a bit late for our group meetup to go for dinner.

I didn't wanna talk to the others because I felt realy betrayed and was afraid I was gonna ruin the night by complaining, but then I heard Nelly and some others talking about how ungrateful I was and how dramatic and something just snapped and I went into a full blown panic attack. First it was just hearbeat, then hyperventilating and then came crying out of anger, panic, and also shame. Matt told the others to go ahead and it took what felt like an eternity to calm me down. I was afraid this was gonna happen and now it did and my ""friends"" were mocking me for it.

The rest of the vacation was a strained. The mood of the group never recovered and the topic was avoided after that. I thought Nelly and I had moved on from this, but recently she brought up how I never apologized. I was shocked, because the memory is really triggering for me and hear her say that she thinks I owe her an apology for having a panic attack made me really angry. I asked her to leave and have been wondering if I do owe her an apology or not ever since. I don't think I do, but she clearly thinks otherwise.

58,1chyz6x,AITA for not telling my boyfriend that my « male » cousin was a family friend ? ,"So me (F22) and my boyfriend (M23 ) met 1.5 years ago and we got together 9 months ago.

I have a sister Emi (F27), a brother Leo (M26) and my « cousin » Kai (M26).

 Some info : When I was around 6 Leo and Emi met Kai and they became close really quickly.

Now I was quite young at this time so I don’t remember everything very well but I know that by the time they were 12 Kai was at our home basically everyday after school and had sleepovers at least once a week and when he was 14 he was also sleeping over on some week end and coming with us to familly events.

For highschool my parents paid for his tuition so he was able to go with my siblings and from that time he basically moved in (I think it was when my parents became his guardians).

After that he really came everywhere with us and it’s when we started telling people that he was our cousin to avoid questions and long explanation. It helped that he already knew our whole family.

 For my aunts and uncles he is their nephew, my grandparents call him their grandson and he is the cousin of everyone.

 Now as I said I am very close to my family and my siblings so in my close group of friends everyone know them. My parents have a big house with a pool so in the summer me and my friends often go there and pretty often my siblings are also there.

 It’s how my bf met my family. At that time he was still my friend and when I introduced him I told him that Kai was my cousin. The same thing I say to everyone.

 After we got together he came to some family dinners at my house and of course Kai was here.

 

Now the issue : This week end we had a big family party with all the extended family and I invited my bf. It was the first time that I was introducing him to all the members of my family. Everything went well until he asked where were Kai’s parents. At first i didn’t understand until I realised that indeed if he was our cousin his parents were supposed to be here. So I told him the truth, that he wasn’t really our cousin. My bf said ok.

 I didn’t realise at the time but he got weird, and he was distant on Monday so yesterday I went to his place to talk to him. He told me that he was upset that I kept the fact that Kai wasn’t my real cousin a secret. That as my bf he should have know that I was spending so much time with a male family friend, he especially talked about vacations and stuff like that. That he felt betrayed.

I honestly don’t know what to think. It’s true that I am close to Kai as much as my siblings, I don’t see any differences between them, but I also realise that our family family dynamic isn’t really « the norm », but I also think that my bf have no right being mad at me for being this close to « another man ».  ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for not telling my boyfriend that my « male » cousin was a family friend ?

59,1chyy0o,AITA for telling my Dad why I don’t want to go on vacation with him on Memorial Day weekend? ,"I’m 32 years old and my Dad keeps messaging me every couple of days asking if I can go to an out of town trip with him and my Mom on Memorial Day weekend. I do not enjoy vacations with my parents, as all my Dad does is stress out the entire time, argue with my Mom, ignore us so he can zone out, spend 4 hours a day walking his dogs around the hotel to get “private time”, and maybe has about 1-2 hours of actual quality time that is peaceful out of the entire weekend. This has reoccurred since my childhood, and hasn’t changed. 

Well, when my Dad pressed me to give him a yes or no answer, I told him I am not sure yet, my friends had plans and I still need to discuss with them and see what’s going on, as it’s still a month away and I haven’t had a chance to work out my own plans.

 He then presses me more, saying “this is what family does, go on vacation, not chose friends over family”

 In which I replied honestly, and as polite as I could, “whenever we do go on vacations, we end up arguing the entire time. I don’t know if I want to commit to that yet.” 

He immediately gets defensive, turns his back to me and repeats “okay, Cam” over and over any time I try and explain what I meant. 

As I walk away, I hear him shout back at me “you know, you have a real attitude problem!” 

And I left it at that. 

Am I the asshole for what I said?

60,1chyvxq,AITA because I defended my cousin when his mom was comparing him to me?,"So my (17M) aunt was over 2 Mondays ago along with my cousin. He's a senior and he's graduating this year. He doesn't know what he wants to do and he was on the verge of failing this year. Instead on scolding him in private my aunt was doing in the open. She started comparing me to him and it just made me uncomfortable and I could tell he was getting upset about it.

 I cut my aunt off and told her that I hate school and that I only got the grades that I have because I used to get in trouble if I made Bs. I told her that if school was optional I would NOT be going so I don't see why she should compare my cousin to me when I'm not even sure if I'm going to college once I graduate. This pissed off my parents.

 They got mad at me for jumping into an adult conversation when I shouldn't have opened my mouth but they were discussing it right in front of me. They also got mad because I said I wasn't planning on going to college? I told them that I didn't really care what they thought because once I turn 18 I wouldn't need their permission for anything regarding my education. They grounded me for about a good 2 weeks until they gave me my phone back. I don't understand what I said wrong. I hate school. I'm forced to go. And my cousin and I are basically the same he just has worse grades than I do.

62,1chy5fa,WIBTAH if I reported my roommate for neglecting his dog?,"I have a roommate (M33), we’ll call J, who has neglected his dog for the past 9 months.  His dog is suffering and so are the roommates. His dog is a large, high energy and a social breed. He dog has lost a lot of weight since he won’t eat if J isn’t home, he is left outside for days at a time, be locked inside his tiny room for days at a time, he’s wallowing in his own filth, and he’s lonely as hell. 

9 months ago, J started dating a new girl. It started with him slowly being home  
less and less, which we all saw as normal for a new relationship. Then he  
slowly stopped coming home and relied on 3 roommates to take his dog out and  
take care of his needs. 

At first no one minded helping because it was only 1-2 days a week. Over time, it  
became 3, then 4, then 5, then we were lucky if we saw him once a week and we  
all became extremely irritated at him for making us take care of his dog and  
stopped replying to his texts.  For a time, J started coming home more to  
care for him, but when he did, he acted pissy. Slamming doors, stomping through  
the house, and doing it late at night. J only works 2 days a week and sits on  
his girlfriend’s couch all day when she’s at work.

Then he stopped coming again and we decided we needed to talk to him. We are all in college, have jobs, our own dogs and social lives and we told him it’s unfair  
to us/his dog. We talked to him several times and he always said he was going  
to be better and was working on a solution. The problem is that this guy is  
desperate to be seen as the nice guy. Constantly telling you how nice he is and  
how good of a guy he is. He is constantly telling you the image you should have  
of him and is desperate to be seen as the nicest guy that when confronted with  
an issue, he will just nod and tell you what you want to hear and say he will  
be better, then doesn’t.

We got desperate. We talked to his girlfriend a few times, we called his mom, and talked to our landlord. But because his dog is ESA, our landlord can’t do much. 

Now J comes home once/twice a week for maximum 5 min, takes him to the yard on a leash, and leaves again for days. He is scary skinny, poops/pees in his room  
and J won’t clean it up, so he’s living in his filth, and we are stuck with the  
awful smell that only gets worse. We would check on him when we could, but the  
smell is so bad we can’t without getting sick. He’s become aggressive from lack  
of socialization, is tearing apart the wall and screams night and day. Not  
howling or barking, but screaming, nonstop. All night long. 

We are sick of the smell, aggression, and noise. I’m not getting sleep because of  
it and my room smells because its coming through the walls.

We have been afraid to pull the trigger because we know what he’s like when the  
nice guy act drops. We feel we have done all we possibly can, and we are afraid  
to check on him one day and have him dead or be attacked.

  
UPDATE: I spoke to my land lord and today he is telling him he needs to find the dog a family and pay for repairs on the room, or he will be evicted. At which point we will be reporting him.

I texted this to EVERYONE confirming they still were okay to join and if  the bill amounts were uneven let’s all bring cash or we can Venmo each other afterwards. Everyone RSVPd no problem.

She absolutely refused to blindly put her card down and proceeded to pull out a pen and paper and itemize the entire bill. If that wasn’t embarrassing enough at a fine dining restaurant, this process took about 40mins and completely ruined the mood and the end of the birthday. We were there to celebrate and everyone knew the prices and the payment situation going in and since we could not split it, itemizing was a waste of time. She kept ripping up the paper and starting over, also completely ignoring TAX TIP AND GROUP FEES. So her itemized decision of what her and her husband owed was off by a lot. 
She finally declared a random number she would pay and then I paid a larger majority than that leaving the group with a smaller amount to be owed. 
Afterwards I was extremely upset but tried to keep it together for the sake of the birthday. We were all supposed to go out afterwards and everyone cancelled due to the mood killer. A week later when I calmed down Lucius texted her about it and she in insisted I was an AH  for inviting so many people to an expensive restaurant that doesn’t split checks and they probably would have split it if we asked.

64,1chxmzt,WIBTA for considering suing my family for negligence of my puppy?,"I’m the asshole for considering suing my parents. But It’s fair for me to be upset that they caused this, even if it was an accident. 


WIBTA if I ask my parent to reimburse for their negligence?

I 20f, am a college student. Earlier this year I got a puppy. She is the love of my life and means everything to me. I decided that was going to move down half of my dorm the weekend before finals week. This included my puppy as our school has very strict quiet ours during finals week and she has a habit of whining. I thought all would be well when it came to leaving her with my parents for three days. Tuesday- Thursday. All they had to do was feed her, take her out to potty, and give her some love. Simple. However when I was home my dad fed her while I was asleep, overfed her actually. She went to my clinic and got check out. It was a concern but okay. I have my family very specific instructions and I even prepared all her meals for her her so they wouldn’t mess up her feedings from now on. Then I left. The next day I got a FaceTime from my sister saying my dog was throwing up. She threw up a piece of a toy. Which she’s not allowed to play with without supervision. This concerned me so I asked them to take her to my clinic. My mom refused. My sister found all the pieces to the toy so I didn’t make the drive home that night. This morning my dad texts me saying the dog is sick and he’s taking her into the vet. My clinic did an ultrasound and discovered a foreign body. Aka the toy that she ate has now impacted her. My mom called to blame it on me and claiming the dog was already sick. This is now set me back $6000 and my parents are not taking responsibility for their negligence. 

For extra context I go to school a little over four hours away so I can’t make the drive home very often. We have finals this week and most students are advised to take their esa’s home. I left Monday and planned to come back Thursday. Leaving her in their care for three days for payment.

We planned this event 1-2 weeks beforehand but couldn’t get the right date and time for me to come help him because I had finals that week. To add on to the story my other boss from my actual job was coming to help us to make extra money but he also was going to be late. I was in class when I called boss/friend to tell him that we both most likely was going to be late, since my professor wasn’t here for the finals. We talked for a minute because he was already at the job and I had a final exam at that time.  He let me come a little bit later which was around 1 pm while the other guys started at 8 am or some time after. After I got done I noticed that there was one address sent on my phone so I went to that Church area. Well it wasn’t the right church and so I called him again and he told me to come 20 mins the opposite direction. The more I thought about it on the drive, I started wondering why did I go to the wrong Church. So I read my text messages and saw that he never even sent me the address of the location I was supposed to go to, even though we planned for 2 weeks. I got really pissed off, because beforehand I have told him multiple times to text me the address instead of telling me it because it’s easier for me to know where I’m going. I started driving there, he texted me and said he told me the location on a phone call in a long message. I was heavily confused because I had no memory of him even telling me an address, but again I was working with 2 hours of sleep and had a final right after our conversation which he knew. So when I got there I found him and started going off. It made me frustrated because he expected me to know where to go when the address was random numbers and the name of the street, plus he told me that an hour before I was on my way. I also didn’t understand how he expected my friend to get there because he didn’t communicate with him at all. So I told him it was very stupid on how he managed people and a good boss would have sent the location through any form of message so the person could have a clue to where he’s going. I also started to raise my voice at him which I tried my best to calm down but it just every single time he doesn’t listen to the words I say and keep doing the same thing.

68,1chwdkv,WIBTA if I think my rich sister should get less help from our parents?,"I (44F) have an older sister (49F) who is married with a couple of kids. I am a single mother with a couple of kids. 

My sister's husband (52M) works in Finance and they do very well. I just heard he's getting ready to retire! I don't know exactly how much they're worth, but they have sent both their kids to Ivy League colleges, own their multimillion dollar home outright, and take pretty nice vacations. I would guess they're worth somewhere in the $7-$10 million range. I will say that they are not ""showy"" about their money. They don't flaunt it or brag about their stuff. They are quietly wealthy, but no one's confused that they are.

I work at a pretty stable job in the public sector, so while I can make ends meet, it is pretty difficult for me and I don't have a lot of ""fun"" money. And I do not have my house paid off and I take pretty frugal vacations and I am totally sweating how to pay for college for my kids. Even if they go to an in-state school.

Our parents are pretty wealthy, too. They have a big home in a medium cost of living city. And they also have a nice vacation home in a travel destination area. They also take nice vacations, although less so these days now that they aren't physically able to travel as much. They're getting old, and their health is starting to get bad. I don't want them to die anytime soon, of course, but aging sucks.

My sister and I have started talking about Assisted Living for them. I live close to them still, so a lot of that will fall on my shoulders to help with.  Our parents have said that everything is split 50/50 between me and my sister, and that they will sell both their main house and the vacation home when they go into Assisted Living. So we won't have to deal with any real estate. I think their total estate will be somewhere around $2.5-$3 million, although how much we inherit will depend on how much they end up spending while in Assisted Living.

When they do eventually pass away, I think I should get more of the inheritance, though. My sister does not need it and I do. I never married, but she did and got lucky  marrying a guy with a good career. My brother-in-law is a little arrogant, but he's not a jerk to my sister, their kids, my parents or me and my kids.  I already do get some small benefits from my parents since I live close. They helped with my house down payment, and whenever we go out to eat, me and my kids always eat for free. And I can use their vacation home whenever I want to. My sister lives far enough away that it's not really convenient for her and her family to use it. 

But I think it would be more equitable for me to get a larger inheritance. Maybe something more like 2:1 instead of 1:1.

I’m just overall pissed that I gave them so many handouts and it feels like they through it away and spat in my face

At no point have they made any effort to make their own account.

This past Christmas, they got Baldur's Gate III as a gift. I guess they'd asked for it on PC, so it's on the shared Steam account. A couple months ago, I asked if I was allowed to play it, sibling said yes.

Recently I've been looking into mods for BG3, and I downloaded a couple. Nothing raunchy, just one to remove the party limit and another that made one character look like Handsome Squidward (I saw it in a video and thought it was funny).

When my sibling found out about this, they were pissed at me because I'd downloaded mods without asking them first. I showed them that the mods only affected my playthrough and wouldn't work on their computer since the files were only on mine. Despite that, they're still really upset at me for it, and when I asked why, they didn't respond.

So, where I live, we usually take coaching classes for the common entrance test of the country and that is after usual school hours.
I wanted to go to a reputed coaching but the fees is too high and my dad told me that we cannot afford that much (it was $1800 for a full year).

We discussed this and I was going to try for a scholarship test. I did the test and got a discount but it was still about $1200 and that was out of budget. This test allowed us to give two attempts and I wanted to attempt again and try for a better score and for that reason, I did not tell my dad about the previous discount.

Fast forward to today, my uncle and his family came over for a gathering and while they were about to leave, he asked me what I wanted to be. I have always wanted to be a scientist and everyone knows that but I just stayed quiet. He then came and adviced me to become an engineer and that I could later do a PhD and become a scientist who earns well, I agreed. But to get into a good engineering college, you need a good score on the entrance and to get a good score, you need a good coaching.

He asked me if I was already going to a coaching. I wasn't. 

I told him about my scholarship tests and all of that and then he just told me that he would pay for my coaching classes because the tests are just a waste of time. I was hesitant but he kept insisting. I looked at dad and then I agreed to let him pay for the coaching classes because he would not stop. 

I feel like that made dad feel bad because he is the one who's taken care of all my bills so far and my uncle paying for one of them made him feel like he's not able to do enough.

I tried to talk to him. He was like you made me look incompetent and incapable of being able to afford your fees and made me look bad. I tried to convince him that it was not what I did but he just didn't listen and is not talking to me now.

His mother approached me and told me that I was out of line. I wanted to tell her they had problems years ago and that there was no need to be hostile now, but she told me that he still has extreme anxiety when he  sees the guy. She even showed me medical documents that show that he had significant issues from the incident from back them, feeling heaviness in chest and agitation and anxiety for days after reminding himself  of bullying.

In the past Lex and I have argued over them not liking Jane's vibe and didn't want to sit near them. I told then that's okay and I'd sit with Jane elsewhere. This bothered Lex for some reason and led to a huge argument between us.

After this argument there was another over homework they thought I was withholding from them, then thought I was talking bad about them. Lex went on a rant of everything they thought I did wrong including calling me some nasty names. I told them I was sorry and immediately worked on fixing said issues. Lex had told me after this that they were crying about what they had said.

After this I made the decision to slowly remove them as my friend. As I worked on removing then they made comments comparing me to comic relief side characters, which continued to distance our bond.

All of this led up to today when Jane approached me. As Jane approached Lex went ""its her"" with a annoyed sigh. I got up and walked to sit with Jane. I then reached out to Lex asking them politely to not hate on my friends if I was around. I made sure to validate their opinion of my other friend. They then got upset asking ""what are you on"" ""I never said that"" ""That's not talking bad"" ""it's too early for this"" and a few other things.

82,1chsvzu,AITA for telling my MIL why I have vaseline next to my bed?,"Hello, sorry for the new account, I don't want this associate with my other account.

Okay, so, my MIL! Or actually I will start with my wife ""Tara"". Tara is lovely and wonderful. Tara also escaped from her little midwestern hometown and ran to the coast the absolute moment that she could, and I am pretty sure her mom took that personally. (her mom was born and raised in and around that small town)

So my MIL. She is emotionally immature. Tara read that one book about immature adult parents and she finally understood her family dynamic in a way she never did before. MIL is not a bad or evil person, she usually means very well, but she's kind of, I don't know how to put it, self-centered? Like her first thought process is always ""how do I feel about this new information"".

Tara and I bought a little starter home last year (fuck interest rates but we're hoping they come down and we can refinance, the place was too good to pass up) and her MIL invited herself over last week. This is something that is extremely on brand for her, and we like to pick our battles in this family, so we just let her. 

Her mom (who again is not terrible, just has bad emotional regulation and boundaries) shows up and drops her stuff in the spare room and just immediately starts giving herself the tour. Again, whatever, we actually hired a cleaner before she arrived so we wouldn't worry, annoying but that's life.

So she's wandering around and comes to our bedroom. I have a jumbo sized tub of generic vaseline next to my bed because I use a nose CPAP and my lips get chapped so she picks it up and makes this really weird face and says, almost direct quote, ""well I know what THIS is for!"" And I respond, ""oh that's for chapped lips, I don't jerk off with vaseline.""

Apparently my timing was good because my wife laughed but my MIL did not laugh at all. Then for the next three days she kept asking me ARE YOU GONNA BE GROSS AGAIN when I tried to make normal conversation. I said over and over that she was the one who made the joke and her response was always ""yeah but that was a JOKE!"" like what I said was totally serious? And I guess it was, I mean, I was telling the truth, but I was only bantering because she started it. I didn't even invite her into our bedroom.

Anyways she brought it up over text to Tara and there is subtle pressure from her to just apologize, but I don't think I did anything wrong.

83,1chsp2o,AITA for telling my sister she was unfit to take care of our nephew and niece?,"English is not my first language, thank you.

I’ll give background context first, me (29M) and my sister (34F) have never gotten along with each other. Since I was a kid I’ve lived with my grandparents, because our parents didn’t want more kids than my sister, so we didn’t grow up together. And the times we did see each other, were short and just holidays. 

She is a cop, single. I run my (late) grandparents’ business, and I date my girlfriend (30F) for 6 years, we live together. 

Now, the actual problem. I’m not sure what happened with my cousin (her kids are technically my 3rd grade cousins, but I call them nephew and niece) but she got into drugs. She has two kids with different men that never showed, I’ll call them Max and Sara. Max is 13, he is rude and seems always at edge of anything, he has been suspended from his school multiple times, gets into fights often and already smokes. Sara is 7, she is a shy kid but she still is young, but she seems in a better mental condition than Max is. 

Our cousin recently overdosed and was sent to the hospital, she is fine, but police took the kids as she was seen unfit to parent them. So we were contacted, and yesterday I met with my sister and my girlfriend to discuss it, it was my first time seeing my sister in long, and my girlfriend’s first time. 

We talked about the kids, and my sister spoke like she had assumed she was gonna take them in, saying that her living costs were going up and she was going to need our help financially, I asked what she meant, and she said how she didn’t expect an unmarried couple to take in two kids from a troubled home, that she was a much better fit to parent them, and that social services would trust her way more because she is a police officer. 

I was still confused, and said how was she going to work a full time job and take care of them, then saying how my girlfriend is an art teacher and I work mostly from home, and we were much better for it. She laughed, saying that she didn’t trust me for it, that we could split in any time, and that if I couldn’t take care of my grandparents, how was I supposed to take care of Max and Sara? (For context, my grandparents passed away naturally when I was 20, they were already quite old). 

I’m sure I was visibly annoyed, and told her how she didn’t know a thing about me or my life, never showed interest on being a sister for me, how she shouldn’t talk about my relationship stability if she could barely keep a boyfriend, and how she sounded exactly like our mother. 

She told me to do whatever I wanted, and to see how I was going to be doing with them, and left after that. 
My girlfriend stayed quiet all the time, and then called me out on my behavior. We slept on different rooms. 

Today she was feeling better, but we still talked and she said how I should apologize, I don’t know if I should. 
I talked with a friend on the phone, and he said that while she insulted me to, I shouldn’t have done that.

86,1chsf01,AITA for going through my roommate’s room after she stole from me?,"
I just moved in with my best friend and her mother about four months ago to start college. Everything has been great, up until about two months ago. My best friend’s other friend, I’ll call her Lucy for the sake of this post, unexpectedly got kicked out of her house, so we let her move in TEMPORARILY. We never meant for her to be a permanent resident, and we made that clear. 

Recently, me, my friend, and her mother have all been missing things, mostly makeup/perfume, things like that. Well, my friend informs me that Lucy has had a bad habit of ‘borrowing’ (aka stealing) things from her, and that she has found her personal belongings in Lucy’s bags before. 

We tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We would ask if she’s seen certain things, to keep a look out for them. She’d always deny seeing them. It was always ‘I don’t know’. 

So yesterday when Lucy was gone, My friend and I went into the room that she’s been staying in, and lo and behold, we found everything. Everything that we had been missing was in her room. 

Understandably, my friend gets angry and confronts Lucy over the phone. Lucy gets pissed off and says that she feels unsafe, aggravated, and that her privacy has been breached. While that’s true, she did the exact same thing to us, how does she think that we feel? To get these items, she had to go into our rooms while we weren’t in the house. She had to dig. 

I did my best to stay out of it, because even though I was obviously upset, my friend knows Lucy way better, but of course I had to be dragged into it. Lucy even tried to divert attention by bringing up that my friend was ‘replacing’ her with me, which I honestly have no idea where that even came from. 

I do feel guilty for joining my friend in looking for our stuff, but I feel like part of it was justified, since our trust in her was already broken. Am I the asshole?

TLDR; My roommate stole from me, my best friend, and my best friend’s mom, then got mad when we found our things in her room. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for going through my roommate’s room after she stole from me?

87,1chs2n5,AITA for hiding my friends glasses,"
Me (15F) and my good friend Reese (16M) usually mess around a lot in gym class because there wasn't really a structure to the class (it was basically a two hour study hall). This day our messing around escalated.

It started when we were stealing and hiding each other's phones, which was pretty typical for our jokes, there was no ill intent. After Reese took my phone, I decided it would be funny to take his glasses and hide them on top of our bleachers that were folded up at the time. It was all fun and games until we got to the end of the period and I tried to return them. Reese was at the end of the bleachers, so I thought I could just slide them over to him across the top, this did not work.

The glasses fell in the small space between the bleachers and the wall. It was too small for us to reach any hands through and get them out on our own, so we would get the gym coach to try and help us. However, we had lunch directly after gym class and it was already time to go when this happened, so we decided to ask after lunch. When we went, tensions were high.  Reese was stressed about possibly needing a new pair of glasses and I was terrified because I would be the one responsible if they were broken. I spent most of lunch in tears and couldn’t eat because I had so much guilt.

After lunch, we went to one of the gym coaches and explained the situation. He got this sort of broom that I think cleans the gym (I'm not sure what it was but it had a long stick at the end)??? He stuck it between the bleachers and the wall to try to push it out from behind, but with the bleachers closed we couldn't even see where the glasses were.
He said we could open the bleachers but it might crush the glasses depending on where they were. But after we opened the bleachers we were able to see the glasses (not broken).

The coach worked on trying to fish them out while I held my phone's camera and Reeses phone flashlight to try and get a better view of them. Reese was standing there, just panicked (reminder, he cannot see). After a while, we were finally able to get them out. However, the lenses were badly scratched and the part that connects to the frame had loosened and later snapped. I had no idea what to do but we had to go to our next class, we were already late from this whole thing.

Reese could still see with the glasses, but due to all the scratching, it wouldn’t stay viable. I knew I was responsible for helping him pay for any replacements, but due to some money struggles within my family, I was unable to help more than a few dollars. (I did not realize how expensive glasses are omg) He said it would be okay if I couldn’t pay, but I have definitely sensed a shift in our friendship, it just wasn’t the same. After explaining it to our mutual friend Leo (15M), he said I should’ve never done what I did in the first place and that the whole situation was just really wrong of me.

88,1chs1fe,AITA: broke sister won’t pay back rich brother ,"Two years ago, I lent my sister $3,000 to be repaid when our $30k inheritance from our grandmother came in. It was supposed to come in within months, but it took two years due to numerous reasons. 

During those two years, my sister and her husband went into debt to have a six-figure wedding.  Shortly after, it appears both of them started having issues with their incomes and have also been struggling with their debt. Her husband owns a few restaurants, apparently they aren’t doing well enough to support their lifestyle. Just a complete and utter financial disaster. 

I patiently wait for the inheritance to finally come in, and then my sister messages me saying she is not going to pay me until she fixes her situation. They are selling their share of a business and I’ll get paid then. 

After some months of waiting I message her:

“Hey do you have an update on repaying me? I was supposed to get paid back after the inheritance came. My loan to you was just 10% of the inheritance. What did you do with the inheritance funds?”

I asked her what she did with the inheritance funds because unless it was used to pay down debt immediately, I don’t see any justification for not paying me. I heard she have invested a portion of it in the market. I strongly feel that paying me back takes precedence over investing (gambling?) it in the market. 

Her response in full:

—————-

Do you sit in [location] and think hmmmm

Let me ask my sister for 3k

“What did you do with the inheritance funds”

Like what are you on about

It’s called, we are actively trying to fix our situation

So no I am not paying you 3k until I do

And that is my final answer

If you would like to complain more when your net worth is SIGNIFICANTLY more than mine

I have explained very clearly that [husband] does not have a salary

If you message me again about this until I tell you that we’re good, do not expect me to speak to you again

I have been more stressed out than I’ve ever been in my life

And I will not have my multi millionaire brother be on my ass about 3k

Get some fucking empathy

———

Edit: including my response back to her

————-

True or not true you invested some of it in crypto?

How much net worth do you need to your name before you pay me back the 3k?

U literally got a 30k cash infusion

You couldn’t survive with 27k?

You think because I have money and you don’t, you can avoid paying me back on time

It changes the ethics equation for you

When I lent you the 3k to survive UNTIL the 30k came in

Then it came in and you had enough spare money to clown around in crypto

Nope that’s not ethical.

You clear the debt

It’s about trust

A 3K payment is going to sting regardless

It’s only 6 months of a horse payment

It is unhealthy to have this debt hanging over our relationship. So settle it, and move forward.

—————-



So my position here is pretty clear.  The debt was 3k. We received 30k inheritance from our sweet grandmother. If things aren’t dire enough that they have money to invest in the market from that 30k, then that is money that should be paid to me first. End of story. 

My current financial standing is irrelevant here, and is just an excuse to not do what is right. 

Some are asking whether I have proof of original agreement. Yes I do, over text. 

So, AITA?    Do I need more empathy?


",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA: broke sister won’t pay back rich brother  Two years ago, I lent my sister $3,000 to be repaid when our $30k inheritance from our grandmother came in. It was supposed to come in within months, but it took two years due to numerous reasons. 

During those two years, my sister and her husband went into debt to have a six-figure wedding.  Shortly after, it appears both of them started having issues with their incomes and have also been struggling with their debt. Her husband owns a few restaurants, apparently they aren’t doing well enough to support their lifestyle. Just a complete and utter financial disaster. 

I patiently wait for the inheritance to finally come in, and then my sister messages me saying she is not going to pay me until she fixes her situation. They are selling their share of a business and I’ll get paid then. 

After some months of waiting I message her:

“Hey do you have an update on repaying me? I was supposed to get paid back after the inheritance came. My loan to you was just 10% of the inheritance. What did you do with the inheritance funds?”

I asked her what she did with the inheritance funds because unless it was used to pay down debt immediately, I don’t see any justification for not paying me. I heard she have invested a portion of it in the market. I strongly feel that paying me back takes precedence over investing (gambling?) it in the market. 

Her response in full:

—————-

Do you sit in [location] and think hmmmm

Let me ask my sister for 3k

“What did you do with the inheritance funds”

Like what are you on about

It’s called, we are actively trying to fix our situation

So no I am not paying you 3k until I do

And that is my final answer

I took the first 6m off work to heal from a difficult birth and bond as they were born at 34w. My husband took time off to help; he is a very active and loving father & husband. I returned to work full-time, and twins attend daycare. 

The twins’ 1st birthday is in 2m, and I’m planning a birthday party. My parents & in-laws live out of state (different states) and are retired in their 60s. I reached out to gauge interest & availability. I would have considered moving the date out, but the following weekend is a major holiday, so I’m trying not to interfere with that – I also want to have the party on their actual birthday weekend. My husband & I initially discussed that we won’t have anyone stay with us to not show favoritism between families.

My parents plan to drive & stay nearby during the week & help with the kids where they can – no conflict with being here on their birthday weekend and come beforehand to help us get ready for the party.

My in-laws are flying, but we had a lot of debate on schedule. My MIL mentioned she had tentatively agreed to babysit for my SIL/BIL (let’s call them Kay & Ben) that weekend so that Ben can attend a get together w/ friends. This event is for Ben, but Kay also wants to attend – hence MIL babysitting their other 4 grandchildren. MIL says that there is no one else that could babysit & that she would feel bad cancelling because she tentatively agreed & Ben had to pay his deposit for a rental. They asked if we could move the party to accommodate.

We moved the party so all could attend. However, their flight arrives the AM of the party & have booked on a budget carrier that often delays/cancels flights – leaving them at risk of missing the party, showing up late, or asking us to pick them up from the airport immediately before/during the party. They are also now planning on staying with us, which goes back on not showing favoritism.

MIL babysits a lot for Kay/Ben. Ex of family dynamic – Kay was expecting her third child 1m before our wedding; when she was pregnant, we discussed that we completely understood if she couldn’t come. Her response was, “A wedding is just one day, a baby is forever.” It feels hypocritical now with no reciprocation with the twins turning 1, in which in-laws are prioritizing babysitting.

I'm trying to focus on the positive -- but I can’t shake that I’m hurt / annoyed by accommodating for something optional & also husband caving to letting them stay w/ us.

Looking for advice on a recent issue that I have run into. My fiancé (m 33) and I (f 31) are getting married in August and paying for the entire wedding ourselves. it’s not a huge wedding but it’s fairly sized with about 80 guests. My fiancé has a childhood friend who hasn’t made the best choices in his life. despite that they’ve remained friends. My fiancé has a great job. We have a good home life. While his friend became addicted to drugs very badly and has been trying to clean himself up by taking methadone. This is a constant cycle of getting clean and relapsing over and over with him. A few years ago the friend borrowed my fiancé‘s car ended up crashing it and never paid us any money back for any of the damages. We really havnt heard from him since which I was fine with. He is no longer with the mother of his children, and I’m not sure if he sees his children . recently he’s been doing “better” and he’s dating somebody new.  because of how well he’s been doing and since they are childhood friends my fiancé wanted to invite him to our wedding. He’s been living in a recovery house and he met his new girlfriend who is in recovery also. my fiancé thought of a good solution which was to invite him and have his mom as his plus one. My fiancé is very close with his mom as well so I thought this would be a great compromise and to make sure that the night went smoothly. Him and his mom RSVPed and now this is where the dilemma comes in. my fiancé randomly got a call from him asking what the cost is to cover his girlfriend coming to the wedding because she’s bummed she can’t come. my fiancé told him that there’s no cover charge but there is a cost associated with everybody. He said he would let him know if he can bring her. I personally don’t know the girlfriend and I don’t want her to come I also don’t want to shell out 250 for her to come. Not only that that’s now three people in their party We’d have to accommodate. The friend knows that he will not pay us any money nor would we ask him to pay for his girlfriend to come as he is a sweet talker and it’s just trying to get us to say yes she can come. personally I don’t trust him or the girlfriend so having his mom come with him was the best compromise, what do I do?

92,1chrrej,AITA for expecting my ex to pay rent?,"I broke up with my ex 7 months ago. Let’s call them Lee. Since the breakup, Lee started coming home less and less, and eventually stayed out most of the time, with their stuff still here, but continuing to pay rent. 

In early April, they texted our group chat (we have another roommate) and said they would be moving out in May, two months before our lease ends. 

I spoke to Lee, and asked that they pay their share of the remaining rent. Our other roommate and I both owe them some money. (I feel ashamed of this, but during our breakup they said that it was ok to take my time giving it back.) So I suggested that their share of the rent could come out of what we owe. They initially agreed to this, and later changed their mind after speaking to their fiancée.

Let’s call their fiancée Veronica. We were polyamorous, and they had started dating a few months before we broke up. Our breakup had nothing to do with her, and was just us having different visions for the future and me falling out of love with them. We were previously all friends, but since the breakup I have felt a hostility from her that Lee confirmed. 

So anyway, Lee changed their mind, saying that they signed the lease under the agreement that we were together, and now that we have broken up, they no longer have the obligation to pay. I asked if it would be possible to find some kind of middle ground. They suggested paying half their rent and keeping their stuff there till the end of the lease. I agreed. 

As I left the venue, Veronica yelled at me. She said I was the most toxic person she has ever met, and that Lee has been paying their rent honestly despite not living there, and that I have been using them. She accused me of smiling “because I knew what I was doing”. 

She said that since I was a local and Lee and her were foreigners, it would be easy for me to find another job. (Lee told me that Veronica had lost her job, which is why they needed to move.) 

I was stunned. I told her I was sorry that things have been hard for her, and that I was smiling because I was nervous (because she was yelling at me). I didn’t know what else to say, so said I was sorry and left. She said, “you should be.” 

Later that night, Lee texted the group chat again, saying they felt manipulated into this agreement, and that they would move out by May, wouldn’t pay the remaining rent, and asked for their deposit back as well.

I’ve now drafted a message giving them two options: 

1. Find someone to sublet their room for the remaining months, or

2. Sever the agreement, and we will take their share of the deposit. 

For context, their deposit is two months worth of rent.

Is it reasonable for me to expect that they take care of their share of the rent, even though I was the one who broke up with them? Am I being somehow extremely toxic and “using” them, like Veronica said? And if they don’t pay and don’t sublet, is it reasonable for us to not return their deposit?

I (32M) have a housemate, let's call her Julie (19F), and a girlfriend of 2 years, Anna (28F).

I own this house. Julie is a friend of the family who goes to university, which is walking distance from my house. If she stayed at home with her parents, it would be an hour commute each way. Our agreement is that Julie doesn't pay rent, but she keeps the house clean. She's a friend of the family, and I've known her since she was 10.

To have some pocket money, she's looking for a job that can be combined with her studies.

Last Friday, I came home and could tell that Julie was down. After asking her a couple of times what was going on, she explained that she was rejected from a job she really wanted, especially after they had her come back multiple times for interviews.

Julie was feeling down because she felt like a burden to me. She was broke and just felt useless.

So, I decided to take her out to cheer her up. I told her to get ready, we were going out to eat. She protested because she was broke, and I told her not to worry, it was my treat.

We went to a popular cafe with a live band. We talked, ate (great burgers!), and it ended up cheering her up.

Anna was visiting her sisters for the weekend. When the sisters get together, they have low contact with the rest of the world.

Sunday afternoon, she was back and came over while Julie was studying. We told each other about our weekends, and I told her about taking Julie out. Everything was okay until I mentioned that the bill wasn't as high as I expected.

That's when Anna asked me if I paid the whole bill, which I confirmed. This upset her. She said that if I paid the bill, that meant it was a date. She took offense to me taking Julie out on a date. She left angry accusing me of cheating or trying to cheat. She has ghosted me since.

I'm trying to wrap my head around this. So, everything would have been okay if we split the bill, but because I paid, like I said I would since I invited her to cheer her up, it's now considered a date and that implies I'm cheating or trying to cheat?

Is this a modern dating rule I'm not aware of?

They aren't really ""friends"", but you know, acquintances, I guess? He is in love with her, and has confessed around 4 months ago. She rejected him obviously, because she is dating me, and more precisely because she is not even remotely interested in him. 

2 months later he confesses \*again\* and acts as if he forgot that he did that before already. My girlfriend then asked me to write a reply together with her, so I basically wrote the entire reply for her which made it \*very\* clear that she has a boyfriend and is not interested.

Today she has a trip with a college group. They ride together in a bus, and she sits together with that guy, because he's the only one she knows, and she's also mostly with him during the trip. That guy is \*still\* trying to make advances on her. Telling her how pretty she is, how he likes her hair, or the make up she did, how much she likes her, and so on.

I then told my girlfriend that I want her to get away from him and not spend any more time with him. To completely reject him and completely leave him hanging.

AITA for this, because I am controlling whom she can be with and with whom she can't?

For clarification: She does have other male friends, that she also visits alone here and there. I have no problem with it. She also told me before the trip that she'd sit together with him and I was fine with it. What irks me is that the guy is still making advances on her, and that's where my boundary is.

I am not insecure, I do not think she'd cheat, given that I know she loves me and that I know she really doesn't like him like that. But I think having my girlfriend stay away from guys that don't accept a ""no"" as an answer, is a fair and valid boundary to have, no?

TLDR; My girlfriend is on a college trip with a guy that she rejected before but still loves her and is still making advances on her, and I told my girlfriend to stay away from him.

96,1chpy5r,AITA for not wanting to do work on the house for my mom?,"I (M 21) live with my fiancé (f22) in my mother’s house that I grew up in. I ‘rent’ from her, I put quotations because we have no official renting contract, I just Venmo her mortgage and we call it good. She is offering to sell the house to me, and she said she would treat it as any other house buyer, so no bullshit, doing things the right way (getting the house evaluated for market price, getting an inspector, etc.) Now, out of the kindness of my heart I have done some minor work on the house for her, the biggest thing I’ve done for her is putting new asphalt shingles on the garage roof, and let it be known I am no professional, but my mom insisted I do it because I would be potentially buying the house from her. So my naive ass did the job for free, but also not perfect, there are areas of the roof that have no wood sub roofing due to wood rot, I just put weathering paper over it and then the shingles and called it good, like I said, not a pro. Fast forward to last week, my mom no longer wants to get the house inspected at analyzed for a professional market price opinion, and I believe it’s because she would be unhappy with how much lower she would be making in the buy if an estate agent and an inspector looked over the house, so she informed me she would be making the executive decision on how much the house costs. This is sketch, and now she wants me to make sure the garage roof is in tip top shape for an inspection coming in a month or two, and I do not feel like doing anything to the roof for her, I am her son, but like she said, she wanted to treat this like any other house sale, so why would I as the buyer, do free labor to pass inspection on a house I don’t own yet. And why would I continue putting my valuable time into something that my mom is now not treating like any other house sale. I want to refuse doing any extra work from here on out, and have an inspector and estate agent to value the house professionally before I even talk about finalizing a deal. AITA for that?

later this year he will get this degree and has already some good ideas about what to do after. what really has been bugging me lately, is the fact that for the past year he been going out with some ""friends"" he made at college. literally dudes in their early 20s, young adults, while he is twice their age. now, he can really pass for way younger than he is (you know that sub ""13 or 30""?) and i guess they took him for a late 20 something. what initially started with ""i am going out to study with them"" ended up him crashing at somebody's place drunk because they partied too hard. i know he is not cheating on me, i follow them on instagram and i see what they do. just guys being dudes i guess. the problem is i need him FUNCTIONING because we have stuff to do around the house and i rely on him since i am at the office all day. we don't have kids, but you know, committments and errands like ADULTS.

when i confronted him about his behavior, he defended himself saying that he never got to experience the ""college life"" and he just wanted to have some fun. i was ok with it initially but as the degree is approaching they really are taking it too far. now he is even talking about going for a vacation with them this summer. i was like ""EXCUSE ME? vacation with teenagers now? maybe you should bring ME for supporting you during all this mess"" he said he would, but wanted to have one last shot at the college life he never had before parting ways forever with them.

eventually i had enough, and i sent a message to one of the ""dudes"" saying if they can please leave him alone for a while, because apparently i have to step up and be the only adult, besides he clearly cannot keep up with them and i am afraid this will affect his grades. he cannot go out as much as they do, he has responsibilities being ALMOST 40 and stuff. well, they distanced from him ever since, he was enraged when he found out and i said i would have preferred if he did it himself, but apparently he was so enthralled by the college life that, for a moment, i really thought he self-convinced to be 20s again. he stopped speaking to me, and said he wants to focus on his final exams.",Asshole,2024-05-01,"AITA for revealing my bf's real age to his college friends i am 40 and my bf is turning 40 too as well very soon. we been a couple for almost a decade now, living together since right before covid. when the pandemic hit, he lost his job and i kept us afloat with my own salary while he tried to get by, until he decided to go back to college because he never got any degree after highschool. we discussed it, i was ok with him not working in order to support his studies. at first he really struggled with focusing and concentrating and almost gave up but i noticed his improvements, encouraged him, and now he really is on a good track for excellent grades.

She invited them to another bar to hang out my boyfriend then told me he considered going but it was a Monday night and he had to work in the morning. this hit me hard and I was like ?? what do you mean that you would have gone? I let him finish his story and apparently, his friend WENT because ""he thought he had a shot at getting laid"" and my boyfriend was just casual about it. I truly was offended that he would even consider going to a different bar with this girl who he later told me was single so I found her profile picture and two days after they ""caught up"" he was liking her updated profile picture on Facebook. mind you in five years I never hear anything about this girl so I brought it up It upset me that he would have considered going to a different bar with this girl and his friend and he got defensive and said he would have told me he was going and I asked if he would have told me who he was going with and he said ""no I cant tell you anything because you react like this and start going crazy on me"" I also told him its concerning how he was so calm and normal about his friend trying to cheat on his girlfriend? and that the entire situation made me uncomfortable and he says I am being crazy Am I overreacting?

She met her second husband almost 2 years after her first husband died. They dated for a little over a year before moving in together and getting married at the courthouse. She was so much happier, she was looking forward to their future again and she changed so much before our very eyes. It was amazing to see her happy again. But it didn't really last.

Her husband's children were old enough to remember their mom and old enough to not blend as seamlessly with everyone. My sister wanted siblings for her daughter, she wanted a true family for her. But she did not get that. Her husband adores my niece with all his heart. But his kids are indifferent and lean more negative in their indifference. They have expressed they're not happy their dad remarried. They have also expressed that my sister and niece will never be people they accept as family and they don't want to work on this.

My sister and her husband and his kids went to family therapy.

It's been four years since they got married and nothing has changed. They are no closer and my sister has become more depressed about the indifference. She has vented to me many times in the last two years about the sadness she feels because her stepkids don't want to even be friends with her daughter and how her daughter looks at them as her big siblings but they have expressed they don't return those feelings. She said it's not what she wanted and it upsets her daughter when the other kids in the house don't even talk to her the majority of the time.

I have always listened. She has mentioned that the therapist has expressed on more than one occasion that the kids can't be forced to love my niece and that they might never be more interested than they currently are. They can try to encourage it without force and make sure the home is welcoming and inclusive. But feelings can't be forced or demanded. My sister has told me she hates that and she feels like she failed my niece. I have reassured her before she hasn't. But she said she couldn't give her them as siblings.

She was in a particularly upset state a few days ago and she was venting and so I may have overstepped and I asked her why she didn't end her marriage if the whole thing was making her this upset. I told her that's not to say she needs to. But she doesn't seem happy and maybe the two of them would do better with just the two of them for a while.

She can have the party the only thing i ask is her dress be white at the church she can have a color at the party and no Alcohol.  The way i see it is that of they are so stuck on serving alcohol the party isn't truly for her anyway",1.0,0.4166085720062256,0,0

103,1chp399,AITA for not taking one of my girlfriends in my Bachelorette trip?,"I have a friend group counting besides me, two other girls and two guys. One girl and guy are dating and the other guy, let's call him Sam, is dating another girl, Kate.

Me, Sam and the others met in college and went through a lot together while Kate was just an addition on the road. I have absolutely nothing against her, she's an unproblematic person, but for me it only represents Sam's girlfriend. We couldn't bond too much and we don't have many things in common except things somehow related to Sam. Me and the girls hung out with her (without Sam) a couple times and we just didn't click. We don't complain because Sam is the one who has to like her, not us.

Anyways I'm getting married to my fiancé and I've always dreamed of this Bachelorette trip. I managed to plan a fully paid 7 days vacation to a nice location for 6 people, me included. Out of these girls, two are the aforementioned from the group and the others are my cousin and two very close friends of mine. I really want to feel surrounded by my closest and dearest girls, that's why I made this stretch. Now, if Sam and the other dude were women, I'd have invited them too, because they're dear friends of mine, but I wanted this to be an all girls trip.

Upon hearing she's the ""only one"" not invited, Sam's girlfriend lost it and instead of maturing up and talk to me, she threw a fit to Sam and sent him to scold me for not inviting her. I explained to Sam the intimacy of the trip and kindly suggested that, even though his girlfriend is often acquainted with us, for me she's not exactly a close friend at the moment. (I'm talking more than 5 years of friendship with the two girls and more than 10 with the other girls invited. Kate has been in the picture much later).

104,1chp01s,AITA for refusing to make a cookie table for my sons wedding,"My son is marrying Wendy and the wedding is this summer. She is not close to her own mother for multiple reason and is pushing hard to have me fill in the gap. I am not comfortable with it at all especially with how hard she is pushing. She has multiple times overstepped boundaries such as inviting herself along, discussing very personal issues, very touchy etc…. 

Due to these issues we are not close and my own daughters are not a huge fan of her. She asked me this week if I would make the cookie table for the wedding. It is something the brides own mother would do with other female relatives. This is the first time hearing about this tradition and I did some research. I would have to make over a thousand cookies from scratch to feed the wedding guest. I asked my daughters if they wanted to do it and it was a strong no.


I informed her that I can not do it, it is way to much work and I don’t have the time. She told me okay and I thought that was it.

My son called me up and told me I am a huge jerk. That Wendy has been crying about it and I should step up. I am still refusing to do it.

AITA?

Edit: common questions

Did DIL tell me the number: Yes she stated 1000-1200

105,1chowp5,AITA for telling my (24F) boyfriend (24M) off for his view on work culture? ,"Last night I (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) were trying to talk about our future together. We’ve been together 3 years and want to come up with a budgeting plan to buy a house. 

While talking I asked if he had considered getting a job. Currently he works Doordash and just finished a year of grad school. He’s an aspiring jazz musician - where we live doesn’t have many gigs so he hasn’t been paid for performing all school year. 

He immediately shut down because he was “caught off guard.” In his mind he had planned to work Doordash all summer to get money. He told me he couldn’t stand the idea of working for someone else and that getting a “real job” just wasn’t who he is. 

Context. I’ve worked since I was 16. I have been working the entire time while he was in school splitting our expenses 70-30. I have begged him to work in the past to take some of the load off but instead he has been using student loans to cover rent for the semester. 

Honestly if he genuinely follows through, I wouldn’t even be mad that he was working Doordash. He makes decent money when he does it, but the thing is every time he’s promised me that he’ll work he ends up not following through.  

I felt upset that he was bashing “real job culture” when I have had to work so much in my life to keep us where we are. We got into an argument and ultimately I ended up saying that if he refuses to acknowledge his toxic view of work culture then I can’t be with him. He couldn’t believe that I said that so easily after 3 years together so he drove off for a few hours. We’re now at this point where neither of us is willing to budge. 

I will admit that I have an anxious attachment style where I push too hard in arguments and I don’t give things time to settle. Sometimes I need to be told that I’m right because I seek validation in arguments and it makes people upset with me - which is valid. I pushed last night and I want to hear that I’m right. I can’t tell if I was right or wrong for pushing this particular issue.

106,1chop5j,AITA for not wanting to put my future on hold to watch my sister's kids?,"

I'm an 18-year-old female with an older sister, Sarah, 29, who has two children, ages 8 and 4. Most of my childhood was spent taking care of her kids while she went out partying. Now that I'm starting a practical nursing course to boost my university resume, Sarah is asking me to put my future on pause and watch her kids so she can enjoy herself before I leave for university.

Our mom warned me when I was young not to babysit for Sarah's kids because of her attitude. She also said this might be Sarah being jealous because she used to study nursing but dropped out due to bad company and not passing her final exam.

Everything came to a head yesterday when applications for the course opened, and I was talking to our mom about it. Sarah overheard that I applied and got mad, shouting about how selfish I am and how this is the only thing she's ever asked me to do. I told her to stop being childish and that it isn't my fault she had children, and I'm not their mother. The kids have called me ""mom"" for about two years, even when corrected. Apparently, I shouldn't have said that, as she started yelling at our mom, saying I'm her favorite because if I wasn't, she would tell me to put my future aside and help her with her children.

Our mom told her point-blank that she would never tell any of us to put our future on hold. She said she gave us all the same opportunity, and it's not anyone's fault that Sarah didn't use hers wisely. Now she has children, and I'm going to take my life more seriously. She needs to take responsibility for her children because no one told her to have them, and she can't look after them.

Sarah started crying and left, then our mom started on me, saying she warned me from the very beginning, and I didn't listen. She said I need to stop being a pushover because I lost all my childhood when I was supposed to be outside playing with friends, going out, and just being a kid. I was babysitting like I gave birth. Our mom said it's my fault Sarah became so entitled because when she made plans for me to go out, I would cancel to watch the children. She's not wrong; I would always feel sorry for Sarah because she knew how to manipulate me, just because I don't like to see people suffer or be sad.

Sorry for the long post; I just want to know if I'm the asshole for not putting my future on hold. I do know I'm not putting my future on hold.

Now, my mother (43F) has her birthday coming up in a few days. She wants to have a family day out that everyone is going to enjoy. Yesterday, she suggested going to look at monster trucks. Since my little brother (12M) was the only one enthused about the idea, she instead booked tickets for a blues concert. Because I don't like blues music, I said that I didn't want to go, instead choosing to stay here and help my grandma look after my other little brother (2M) because I love them both to death and would rather spend that time with them than go to a concert I wouldn't enjoy. She immediately became furious with me, calling me an ungrateful little shit and a cow, and begging me not to ruin her birthday treat, and saying that she thought she'd give me a nice night out and that she was only trying to fulfil my wishes of spending more time with her before I move. This struck me as slightly hypocritical, because the night before she offered to play a game of Scrabble with me. I told her I'd be with her in half an hour after I finished the game I was playing with my brother- the 12 yr old one. Then when I went down, excited to play, she replied in an offhand, don't care tone 'I don't want to now.' ??? Do you want to spend time with me or not?

However, I can see how I might have come across as ungrateful. I shot her down pretty quickly- after she'd already booked the tickets, too. And I kept on saying that in terms of spending time with her it wasn't what I'd had in mind- therefore making it seem like I was trying to make her birthday treat about me. And I wasn't totally calm, I was aggressive too. Partly because she wasn't listening to me, partly because I get angry very easily. And it's very true that I may be ruining her birthday treat.

[Story Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/s/VoPgjeF2Lh)

In December he got his mates dog to take care of him for a few weeks without taking our permission and even though we are not allowed to have pets. We enjoyed having him but has caused loads of damage in the house.

10 days ago we started seeing this random guy in our house the whole time and told us he is staying here for a couple of weeks. He is staying rent free, without our permission, keeps using our stuff and our utilities, and sleeping in my housemates room. He even has PlayStation set up in the living room with his TV. This isn’t the first time his friends stay over, he had a friend staying here a couples days every week for two months, and there was three here for a week.

The dog came over again last week. Both the first and second time he used to keep the dog in the hallway the whole day, never took him out for walks, never brushed him, always forgets to feed him, all we hear is crying, poo everywhere for the whole day until he finally decides to clean it up, and even attacked us a few times. When my housemates would be busy the dog could’ve stayed over 18 hours with no water food or attention.

My housemate went to Manchester for a couple of days while the dog was still here and paid his friend that’s staying over to take care of him. Same story as my housemate, even worse, hardly ever cleaned his poo until it literally stunk the whole house, ran out of food two days before he left and he couldn’t be asked to go and get some. The dog pissed him off once so he locked it outside in the backyard. The dog left yesterday.

Today I came to shower, When I entered the whole shower was full of pubes, when I looked at my razor set I leave in the shower it’d been used with soap. My house mate uses soap for shaving and their hair type matched the one in the shower exactly. They had both showered yesterday as-well. I asked my house mate about it he calmly said it wasn’t him. So I went and asked his friend and he started kicking off calling me disrespectful and how easy it is for him to go get a razor if he needed one.

We started arguing with each other and my housemate had to hold him back because he began to get aggressive. I have voice recorded both interactions secretly for my safety. Now I’m furious and I don’t want him in the house anymore. I am already very annoyed from my house mate due to the incident in the September and now would be good time to get him out.

We are all on separate contracts and pay rent and bills separately. I am a Lebanese international student so I feel like they would have more superiority in this case because they are British.

She also never cooks. Most nights I make dinner, or we eat leftovers, or we get takeout.

110,1chnwuy,WIBTA for giving my [35M] wife [32F] an ultimatum about dental visits?,"
My wife and I have been marriage for 8 years and she is my best friend, but her dental health is causing me intense anxiety. A few years ago, after begging for her to finally see a dentist for the first time since we got married, she saw a dentist who recommended some serious dental work, including extractions and a root canal. 

She hasn’t gone back since. It’s been 2 years.

I've tried all the gentle nudges—offering to book appointments, suggesting we go together, looking for less intimidating dentists or those who specialize in dental anxiety, but nothing has worked and now she either gets defensive if I bring it up during the weekdays she’s too busy with work (alternatively, that “it’s finally the weekend I just want to relax”). 

She’s not in any pain and never complains, but obviously if she continues to ignore the teeth that need to be pulled it could lead to some serious dental complications such as infection and sepsis and early death. She knows the risks of not following up—she's even talked about how it can be dangerous to ignore issues. We make a combined 280k so money is obviously not the issue here. 

I’m extremely concerned about her ignoring dental health. So I’m thinking of setting a kind of deadline/ultimatum. If she doesn’t have a dental visit scheduled by the next time we see her family, we will need to go to couples counseling or it’s over between us. I want to spend my life with her, but I feel like a terrible life partner if I can’t help her address this elephant in the room.

It kills me because she’s my best friend and she was there for me when my dad passed, but it feels like I’m failing for not being able to be here for her and support her in protecting her health. I just actually have no idea what to do. I just want us to grow old and healthy together, but it’s inevitable that she will have serious health complications from neglecting her teeth.

I(26,f) will start in a new job in a new city next month, I can drive but I rarely got the chance to do so (i dont own a car). So last week I just got my driving license. My new job required me to use car because the distance from my housing to the job is quite far. My boyfriend (32M) own a car and usually leave it parked because the maintenance is expensive and he got company car to use. Back story, when he first got the car he always say that this is our car because i do pay for it as well. Last year i gave him money for insurance and tax, this year too. Even my salary would go couple hundred to help him with his commitment. I even pay for his phone installement. Because of that I dont have any money to buy a car let alone license. So this month because of the job i finished my driving license and start to submit loan to bank.


The thing is the loan will takes 2 weeks atleast. When im supposed to start next week. He keep saying to ask around if i can hike with someone to work (like ive been doing for years) but i said i dont want to because i dont want to give that first impression again. He said its normal for someone to not have car on her first job (mind u im in upper executive level). He even asked if i can postpone my start date until i get a car. He simply refused to let me borrow the “our car” because my driving license is too new and his car is a pickup and i wont be able to drive it because its too big.

112,1chnlks,WIBTA if I told my mom to stop vaping indoors/around me and my younger sibling?,"Throwaway because I don't want the drama

I've recently quit smoking and vaping, it's been a couple months and I've been doing very well but my mom has been making it rather difficult

She vapes in the living room all day, she has stopped doing it when I'm directly in the room with her but if I step into the connected kitchen she starts again and I have to open the windows or go outside so I don't breath it in. She'll ask me to come down and do something and I'll walk through a cloud of vapir and can taste and smell it and I don't want to babe any second hand nicotine. It makes me want to not be around her

I have a younger sibling too who is 9 years old. I don't know how much of it is because they're a kid or how much might be because of inhaling second hand vapour every day, but they constantly have a cough. My little sibling frequently coughs up a large amount of phlegm every day and has done for a long time now, our mom doesn't think it has anything to do with the vaping. My mom will vape when she's about 10 feet away from them indoors without much ventilation and will keep vaping up the moment they enter the room, I'm worried this might cause health problems for my siblings

Now my reasons for being reluctant to say anything; I'm an adult, I used to vape with her and didnt realise how bad it was until i quit, life hasn't been that good the past few years so I've been staying with my family again so I feel like it wouldn't go well asking her to not do something in her own house, and her boyfriend already doesn't like me and gets angered easily. Only my mother uses nicotine in the house. I also don't have any proof that second hand vape can be harmful, she knows smoking inside is bad but thinks vaping isn't harmful at all. She's also disabled and has tested positive for a terminal illness that luckily hasn't started showing symptoms yet. So I feel like I don't have any right to say anything, but I worry about my sibling and I don't want to be anywhere near my mother right now because she won't stop vaping in front of me. She also said that she never wants to quit

Would I be a bitch or out of line to ask her to stop vaping inside? Or to at least not vape in the same area that me or my sibling are in/near?

unfortunately, my immediate family and my extended family have never gotten along, and lots of arguments have caused extremely high tensions between everyone. as a kid, i spent a lot of time with my cousins, as we were only 2-3 years apart, and i also spent a lot of time with all my aunts. we would all do basically everything together.

This past February, my mom received a $6k check from child support and told me (I was out the state at the time). When she shared the news, I was a bit skeptical to accept the check. Last time we received the check from CSS, my mom had to pay it back because it came from a joint account from my dad. She told this time it's from my dad's refunds and that it's safer. She put the money in my account (because she forced me to get a joint account with her) and told me to use it however I want since its mine. Then she goes back and say that what if the strings are attached to this one and end up owing again. 

She gave me mixed signals but eventually I did use it because I was actually 3 weeks away from moving and didn't know how I was going to go from Florida to Maryland with only  less than 1k when I still had to pay the prorated month.  That check made the moving process easy and I paid a big amount off my credit card with money left over. 
Now, without my consent, my mother has also been using my money. Before the check, I noticed that the checks I get from work are always lower than expected until I found she's been using my fundings for herself to buy food, Uber and so forth. She makes 3x the amount I make and has a car so I was confused. 

Fast forward to last night, and I wasn't surprised. Child support demanded the money to be returned as apparently my dad does not owe anymore. My mom berated me over the money without explaining anything saying how I ""wasted the money"" and ""it's my fault because I called CPS and I have to pay!"" No, I didn't call and when I did call about Child support, I am not a 3rd party on my OWN case, so I have no say. I told her I legally cannot do anything about it and to call to see what's up. She refused , claiming I was influenced and did this to myself. I told her if I pay, she too has to pay but she refused again because her defense is she sent me money in the past and for that, we're even. I told I won't pay because she swore up and down that it's not really MY MONEY, it's HER MONEY because my father had back loans to pay to HER not me. I used that and she said but I AM the one responsible to pay child support back. 

I said no and she threatened me with legal actions. I called her bluff and said sure.

Before the check, I noticed that the checks I get from work are always lower than expected until I found she's been using my fundings for herself to buy food, Uber and so forth. She makes 3x the amount I make and has a car so I was confused. 

Fast forward to last night, and I wasn't surprised. Child support demanded the money to be returned as apparently my dad does not owe anymore. My mom berated me over the money without explaining anything saying how I ""wasted the money"" and ""it's my fault because I called CPS and I have to pay!"" No, I didn't call and when I did call about Child support, I am not a 3rd party on my OWN case, so I have no say. I told her I legally cannot do anything about it and to call to see what's up. She refused , claiming I was influenced and did this to myself. I told her if I pay, she too has to pay but she refused again because her defense is she sent me money in the past and for that, we're even. I told I won't pay because she swore up and down that it's not really MY MONEY, it's HER MONEY because my father had back loans to pay to HER not me. I used that and she said but I AM the one responsible to pay child support back. 

I said no and she threatened me with legal actions. I called her bluff and said sure.

118,1chm2nf,AITA for choosing to live with my grandparents instead of my siblings and stepmother?,"My dad died 5 months ago. It was really sudden. He wasn't sick. He just went to work one day and didn't make it back home. Dad had five kids. He had me (16m) Mia (11f) and Ky (10m) with our mom and she died 9 years ago. Dad got remarried 5 years ago and had two kids with his second wife. Dad had set it up where Mia, Ky and I would stay with his wife if something were to happen to him. He never brought this up. But when I found out I wasn't really happy and I expressed a wish to live with my maternal grandparents. Ky and Mia wanted to be with his wife. They call her mom and have a really close relationship with her and our half siblings. They wanted me to stay as well. They said they didn't want to lose me too and even though I assured them they would still see me, they were angry and sad. My dad's wife told me I should just stay. That I could give her a chance to be a second mom to me and could have her and my siblings for support. I told her I didn't want to live with her.

An emergency custody hearing was held and I spoke to the judge with my grandparents and my dad's wife in the room with us. He asked me why I wanted to go against my dad and if I would like to have some kind of shared custody set up for me. I said no. I wanted to live with my grandparents outright. That I loved and respected them and needed them but I did not love or respect or need my dad's second wife and that I love Mia and Ky so much and I had nothing against my half siblings, but I felt better being with my grandparents.

The judge agreed. He ordered I could live with my grandparents while Ky and Mia could stay with my dad's wife. He did order the three of us to have individual therapy to help them not hate me. And that helped. They ask a lot of questions when I see them, and they don't understand me not loving ""their mom"" but they do get now that she's not my mom like she is theirs. They know she's not their bio mom. She's the only mom they know.

My dad's wife is furious and she has made so many comments about my decision. She has also brought up what I said to the judge and the fact I don't love all four siblings is disgusting. But she said I turned my back on my family and I basically said I didn't care that she had done her best to be a good mother to three kids that weren't hers, it wasn't good enough for me. She said my decision was totally unfair to everyone and I was selfish.

 My husband works while I work from home while looking after children so I don't need annual leave but husband does. 

I spoke to my husband when invite arrived and asked him to try and book the day off and day after off work and we started to look at hotels nearby. 

Husband said getting time off might be a problem as it is in August so holiday might not be available I asked him to try and he said he would.

For several weeks I have been reminding and asking home to try as I need to let my friend know if we are attending.

Today husband tells me he hasn't asked and isn't going to because he doesn't want to ask because August is a busy holiday month I was upset as we have been looking at hotels and wedding clothes for the event.

I said I wouldn't go without him when the invite arrived however husband said maybe I should think about going on my own. When I suggested only going for 2 hours then driving home l
 
Husband became upset saying he didn't want to come home from work when I and the kids were not there. I got upset and said he tricked me into thinking and planing a way to go without him. 

I then hung up on him telling him that he doesn't want to go or even try to go but doesn't want me to go either which is unfair.

120,1chkuhh,AITA for calling my girlfriend’s kpop obsession unhealthy?,"This is so stupid and I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong but my girlfriend is upset at me and it makes me feel like second guessing.

My (M24) girlfriend (F24) is incredible. She’s insanely hot and probably the nicest person I know. We’ve been going out for just around a year and a half and get along great. My one gripe is that she is obsessed with K-Pop. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not shitting on it, I respect her music taste. I even let her drag me to a concert a while back. It’s definitely not my thing, but it makes her happy so I don’t really care.

Recently though, she seems to have gotten way more obsessed with this group, particularly one guy called Bang Chan. I’m not an insecure man by any means but she has been taking it too far. She changed her lockscreen to a him, and she carries a picture of him around everywhere. She has like 10 of them and matches them to her outfits. She watches every live stream or video that has him in it too.It’s odd but mostly harmless so I haven’t said anything about it.

I mean I’ve had celebrity crushes before like Sydney Sweeney so I know it’s normal to an extent but my girlfriend takes it too far. Recently she spent hundreds on several copies of the same album because apparently it enters you into a prize draw to video call the group? I’m not really sure how it works but she obviously didn’t win and was inconsolable. Not even about her reckless spending but because she cant talk to Bang Chan. She managed to resell them so that wasn’t a problem but I think her obsession with him is a little concerning.

Just today, a picture of him she ordered arrived in the mail and she started cooing over how cute he looked. At this point I’d had enough and told her that her obsession was getting unhealthy and she needed to realise he doesn’t actually give a shit about her and that she’s falling for marketing.

She got really huffy and said she knew that she was just having fun and I was being a dick for making fun of her interests. I honestly think I’ve been really patient with her and haven’t said anything out of line, so am I the asshole here?

  
**UPDATE**



Hey everyone, thank you for all the replies. I’ve read through everything but obviously can’t respond to them all. It’s given me a lot of perspective. I’m glad I’m not the asshole in this situation but honestly I don’t think she is one either. I think some of you might have gotten the wrong idea about her, she’s not obsessed with Korean men or anything in general, just her kpop group, and she’s not prioritising watching live streams over our dates or anything.  
  
  
I admit I blew some things a bit out of proportion, so I feel like I should clear some things up. She doesn’t carry around the picture in her hand or anything, it’s on the back of her phone case and in regards to the lottery raffle,  she wasn't ""inconsolable"" in a literal sense - she was just sad and mopey, which I thought was disproportionate.   
  
  
Obviously I’m not breaking up with her over something so small or fucking her with a mask of him on , but I did talk to her about it like some of you suggested. She reassured me that she was self aware and it was all just a bit of fun, but said she understood how it might seem a bit concerning or uncomfortable to me. She has ADHD so she does fixate on things. Her childhood was also pretty rough so she likes doing things to “make her inner child happy” like this.  
  
  
 She seems to recognise that her interest is childish but doesn’t want it to get in the way of us so she’s promised to tone it down and be a bit more receptive to my own hobbies too. She has attended some of my gigs in the past and seems to enjoy the films we watch together so this could be good for us both.   
  
I think it really clicked for her when I asked her how it would feel if the roles were reversed. If I was carrying around a picture of Sydney Sweeney or Victoria De Angelis all the time. Even if she wasn’t jealous of them, she would find it creepy, right? She doesn’t want to give up the cards completely, because they’re monetarily valuable apparently, but she’s put them in a binder instead of her phone case, which I think is much healthier.  
I’m really glad she was so open, and would like to thank you all for your help.

He’s kind, helpful, treats her like a princess and is both charming and funny. It’s clear that he loves my niece a lot and would do anything for her.

I told my niece she hit the jackpot with her husband a few days ago which has caused some issues between me, my other nieces and their partners. For some context my niece had their first child 4 months ago and because her friends have been telling her horror story after horror story about women who gave up their careers to raise children she’s been feeling scared and stressed. To alleviate her anxiety her husband has moved assets he owned prior to the marriage onto her name and made sure he legally wouldn’t be able to take them back if they were to divorce. I personally think it’s a wonderful gesture. On top of that he’s been leaving work early or working from home whenever she’s feeling overwhelmed or just wants him to stay with her. Obviously, not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to leave work whenever but I still find it sweet of him, especially as she refused to hire a nanny so she would have help while he’s working which he doesn’t get upset at her over.  

He’s my brother-in-law’s favourite son-in-law so my other two nieces and their partners, who were there at the time, are upset because they also think I’m favouring him. Even though he is objectively the better catch, I told them that all of their partners were amazing to soften the situation but I don’t think it helped. One of my other nieces is especially mad because I was praising him for things that ‘normal people’ just can’t do which is unfair to them.

I told them I wanted to call her Britt and they said that was okay. I was asked about the bonus mom thing and I said I'd rather use stepmom. They told me I could change that at any time but they wanted to know which made me more comfortable. So Britt was always Britt and I use Britt and stepmom interchangeably when talking about her. To her face she's Britt. To friends I'll normally say Britt but other people, if they don't know who Britt is, I'll typically say ""my stepmom"" instead of just Britt. And for people who know but I'm not that close to it depends.

Britt and I get along great and I love her. I never saw her as my mom or considered her to be like my second mom though. She's a motherly figure for sure but she's not the only one and I'm not even closest to her out of those motherly figures. My dad and Britt always accepted that though. I know she'd love if I did call her mom or one day told someone she was my mom. But she has never pushed it.

Last Friday we were at Britt's parents house and my dad's side of the family was there too. This doesn't ever really happen. My dad was talking about me making it into the school newsletter and how proud he was. For some reason this started my grandparents and Britt's parents off on calling her ""my mom"".

124,1chhyvw,AITA for complaining about my teachers' behavior and expectations towards my class,"I (M19) am a student of a preparatory class. A few days ago, I learned that one of my teachers openly blamed me for ruining the teacher/student relationships of this year's promo.

With 2 other colleagues they taught 3 of the most important classes in the whole preparatory process, the ones that are detrimental to accessing the higher level education almost everybody in the group sought when entering the structure.

I have had school issues in the past, I went to a psychiatric hospital for dangerous behavior and was put on antidepressants. I spent a year recovering and this was my first year studying post-graduation.

In the first weeks of classes, I began viewing  some of these teachers' behaviors in class as innapropriate for an educational structure. They'd express their desire to spend time with students beyond school time, citing past year's groups' practices (parties being thrown with them) as examples, blaming us for an apparent ""lack of cooperation and social skills""

They also started to take very personally any absence, bad grade, question someone had in class, while consistently comparing us to the class that came before, to the point where every class started with the mandatory 15 minutes of throwbacks to a more ""social time"".

As I was concerned with this, and knew the whole class was pretty distraught by these expectations being thrown at us every time, I started complaining publicly during class, regularly and sometimes extensively about their practices and the content of their lessons (which was a mistake and probably reassured them into the belief I was being a smart-ass). I was not the only one of our little group (16 students) to do this but I was the most frequent.

Eventually, they all started making remarks about my own behavior. In front of the class AND after. One teacher told me he thought I was a ""narcissistic asshole"", another one said that every teacher in the school thought I was a jackass, in front of the whole class. A little portion of the class (2 people) started to be annoyed by my bickering even though we shared those opinions and feelings.

One of the teachers is a local celebrity in this rural town, we learned thru old students and other people that he was dumped by his wife for having a relationship with a student (18F, possibly less). We even met the previous class and saw how they treated the teachers, basically worshipping them and being on a first name basis.

The mood went downhill from there, as the teachers refused to help students that struggled in their classes and even threatened to sabotage our applications to the promised following studies if we continued this ""lack of respect"". At the end of the year, attendance rates dropped, the teachers' rants went longer and longer.

125,1chhlqr,AITA for telling my dad and stepmom their home isn't my home?,"My parents had me and pretty soon after they divorced.  My parents divorce was not amicable. I (16f) don't know all the details obviously, but I know that bad blood exists on both sides. And if you want my suspicions. I think they divorced so badly because my dad wanted to set up his own business but my mom didn't want that to happen right after me. My dad owns his own business ,actually he owned two and the first one he had to close up. The first one he started right after the divorce which is why I suspect what I do. My dad also complained once or twice that mom never supported him.

So there are issues between my parents. When I'm with my mom you would never know it. She does not vent about dad, badmouth him, or try to hide the fact they were married and had me together. She has some photos of us before the divorce in our living room among the rest of the family photos. And while I have issues with my stepdad and he's not my favorite person ever, he has never complained or tried to erase the fact he married a woman who had a kid with someone else. He never got that part wrong despite our issues.

But my dad's house is so very different. It got worse after he married my stepmom. I'm not supposed to mention my mom at all, they don't let me have anything there that my mom bought, even my favorite plushy that mom bought me as an infant. I can't have a single photo of my mom or my half siblings on her side. I used to have a little pinboard of photos and my dad and stepmom went into my room in the past and removed all traces of mom. My stepmom even said she burned the photos of mom. They have told me in their house they do not want to see my mom and my room is not a compromise. So of course I don't like being here. I spend 50% of my time here, and no the courts won't let me stop coming and they would punish my mom if I stop and the judge told my mom if she does not force me to go, and stay, she would pay. After our last attempt a few months ago dad started telling me I don't treat my room like my room or I don't act like it's my home. He asked me why I wanted to leave ""our home"".

On Sunday my dad and stepmom told me I act like I'm a guest in their house instead of part of the family and that it's my home. I told them it's not my home, it's their home. I told them I can't mention my mom or keep a photo of her in my room. I can't do whatever I want with my room like they claim so no, all of that means this was never my home.

126,1chhl9z,AITA for wanting my money back instead of a present?,"I have been friends with this girl - let’s call her nicki for about 4 years and i would consider her as one of my best friends. I wholeheartedly trust her so this incident has left me quite upset. 
there is an event happening soon and nicki was in charge of buying all the tickets for our friends and we obviously all paid her prior to her buying the tickets. nicki was holding onto my ticket for me since i will be going with her anyways. unfortunately, something popped up so i will not be able to attend this event anymore and decided to sell my ticket. 

i found a buyer and he was going to pick my ticket up from nicki but he was paying in cash so i asked nicki to just transfer me the money after she receives the cash from the buyer. a couple days go by and nicki still hasn’t transferred me the money so i asked her about it only to be told that she has something else for me instead. I met up with her and she said she used the cash to buy me a birthday present because it was my birthday a couple weeks ago. 

i didn’t really know how to react because im grateful she got me a gift but at the same time that’s my money?? im genuinely so confused right now because she essentially made me use my own money to buy myself a present that i didn’t even ask for. the ticket was also a couple hundred dollars so i was planning to use the money to pay for my bills but now im just stuck with a random birthday present that i basically bought myself. 

i told a couple people about this and they all said i was being dramatic and ungrateful because nicki was just being nice. am i really the asshole here???

edit: i appreciate all of your responses and after reading them i’ve decided to send her a lengthy message. to sum it up i asked her to return my money or else i will consider taking further actions. 

i just wanted to clarify a few things too. i told her i wanted to return the gift and needed the receipt but when i asked her for it she said she lost it because she didn’t think i would need it. the gift she got me was also less than half of what the ticket is worth so i have no idea where the rest of my money went. she’s also always the “sweet” and “nice” friend of the group so the people i spoke to about this believe she had no ill intentions and that she would never try to purposefully take my money. we are also in our 20’s in case anyone is wondering so no she is not a child.

last update: after a lot of back and forth and a little bit of yelling, nicki has finally agreed to pay me back under the condition that i give “her” present back which was what i was offering to do from the start. she has blown this completely out of proportion and managed to gaslight our friends into believing that i threatened her. it really doesn’t matter to me anymore because she and along with some of my other friends who took her side will be cut from my life. all is good again :)",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for wanting my money back instead of a present?

127,1chhiqc,AITA for wanting to have my friend  as my bridesmaid when my partner hates them?,"For context, I 22ftm, am getting married to my partner, let's call them Denis, 22ftm, 2026. I am really close to this friend, for story sake let's just call her Yvenne. Now I am extremely close to this friend for the following reasons.

I moved to this place from across the country to live with my partner. I literally knew no one here besides my partner. I met Yvennes Boyfriend at this job and we hit it off. I met Yvennes shortly after. Me and Yvenne became very close friends. I'm talking, we call every day, and we hang out almost every week. We talk about everything and anything together. She also understands me more than most because we both share a disability.

So within this past year, Denis and Yvenne have not been getting along. Yvenne has been trying to wedge themself into me and Denis' relationship and has made me insecure about wether or not my partner is cheating on me. My partner does have mental illness, and has split on her a few times.

I have had multiple conversations with Yvenne at this point about how she treets my fiancee. And how is like for her to communicate with my partner. However both sides just seem disinterested.

I only have three friends here. Yvenne, her boyfriend, and then another friend from a different work place.

Now. I want Yvenne to be my bridesmaid. I also want her to be involved in the wedding planning, however... I feel like a jerk, because my partner doesn't even want to talk to Yvenne or text them. They have also told me that they don't want her over at our house. 

I truly don't know what to do at this point, and I'm left asking myself. Am I the asshole for inviting my friend to our wedding as a bridesmaid, if my fiancee doesn't like them?

EDIT 1)

More information that I was lacking in the post:

1. My partner has Borderline Personality disorder. Diagnosed. They are not currently on any medication or in therapy at the moment.

2. I have bipolar 1 disorder and dissociative identity disorder both diagnosed and things I go to therapy for and I am medicated. Though to be completely honest I struggle with taking my medications regularly.

3. Yvenne also has borderline personality disorder. I think I was in my feelings last night because of a constant argument that the three of us have been having for this last week. Orginally- Denis did want her to be in his party. Up until an argument that sparked up because he has been spending more time with a best friend who he happened to be dating in highschool.

4. I had a conversation with Yvenne talking about my insecurities and she did somewhat try to tell me that we where most likely wrong about Denis cheating , but also said in the same breathe that it was weird to her how much Denis and their ex have been hanging out recently, and canceling plans to hang out with me and Yvenne to hang out with the ex.

5. I have communicated and discussed this all with Denis and he is okay with her still at the wedding, and said when he split it made him feel like he didn't want her around anymore.

6. Me and Denis' have a very positive relationship. We talk about everything even the uncomfortable stuff. I just feel like I may have been the asshole because in some situations I do stick up for Yvenne when he gets upset with her. But I always will stick up for Denis. No matter what.

7. Denis has talked to several people that I personally do not like, and has them in his party as well. There is one specific friend that he has that I am incredibly uncomfortable around most of the time, due to the fact that one argument we had, Denis went to her and she called me an abusive narcissistic partner because I had set a boundary with Denis about some emotional abuse he had been doing with me due to his borderline.

8. I recognize that Yvenne walks over me Alot but that is slowly changing as we communicate more boundaries with each other, and overall my stance on Yvenne is complicated. She is a very good friend majority of the time. There are just some things that we need to work on, Denis has agreed with this statement. 

9. We are planning the wedding two years in advance because we are on a very tight income. We are trying to save up for the wedding we both want which is why it is so far out in advance.

10. I come from a very very abusive background. I do have abandonment issues that I am working on, and Alot of amnesia barriers in my day to day life. I admit that sometimes I am a shitty partner, but more often than not I do push aside my wants, needs, feelings, emotions, thoughts and aspirations so that my partner gets everything he could ever dream of. This is why I desperately want Yvenne at my wedding. Yvenne helps me get through my thoughts and communicate what I want more efficiently. 

11. I truly think I may be the asshole in this situation. However I do not know how to change it. Denis's view on Yvenne is constantly changing.

129,1chh7dd,AITA ending a 10 year friendship over a work issue,"I (25F) have been working in an industry where workers are essentially self-employed, but still somewhat managed- rosters etc by a third party. The money is fairly good and the job is flexible allowing me to work 3 days a week with a cognitive disability and afford to make ends meet without other sources of income. Being self employed and earning my income from commissions means sometimes money is great and other times it’s terrible but on average it is a very well paying job.

I reconnected with a close friend (also 25f) from when I was younger and this past year we have become good friends again.
She is on a disability pension and has two casual cash jobs, and she studies part time.

A few months ago she was struggling to make ends meet and I pulled some strings and offered her a job in my industry, she took it and all was well for the first few months- in fact I quite enjoy getting to work with her on the occasions I do.

Our financial situations are now quite different as I make my money solely from my job, and she has the problem of needing to spend money and go on overseas holidays so her pension doesn’t get cut for having too much in her bank.

Here’s the main problem- my shifts are now getting given to her (I’m losing days of work so she has work opportunities).
Basically management is treating us as a sole entity instead of two and that is not her fault but she is benefiting from it.
I spoke to her when it started happening a few weeks ago as I’ve been low on cash, and asked her if I could have my regular shifts back as she has all of these extra sources of income and my job is my only income.
She got offended by the fact I brought up her pension and said it has nothing to do with the matter. I disagreed but we came to the agreement that if it were to happen again she would give me priority to my own shifts since I got her the job.

Fast forward to recently and it’s happened again except this time she put her foot down and told me she’s taking the shift, which would be fine if it wasn’t one of my two shifts this week. (Due to her wanting me to take a day off to go to a concert with her- and lied to me about the price knowing I can’t afford it)

Her lack of awareness to others situations and her lack of thankfulness for getting her a job has really irritated me.
The big reality check for me has been realising the only thing people care about is money.

I’ve never had an issue with her being on a pension as I understand the supports it allows access to are necessary for her functioning, like free psych support, occupational therapist etc but it also grants access to things she does not need, like a minimum wage without working, and disabled parking to say the least.

I have the same disabilities as this woman but I understand I would need to lie about my severity to access a pension- and that doesn’t sit right with me.

Her selfishness and entitlement has really given me the ick and I don’t think it’s worth keeping her as a friend, AITA?

She got offended by the fact I brought up her pension and said it has nothing to do with the matter. I disagreed but we came to the agreement that if it were to happen again she would give me priority to my own shifts since I got her the job.

Fast forward to recently and it’s happened again except this time she put her foot down and told me she’s taking the shift, which would be fine if it wasn’t one of my two shifts this week. (Due to her wanting me to take a day off to go to a concert with her- and lied to me about the price knowing I can’t afford it)

Her lack of awareness to others situations and her lack of thankfulness for getting her a job has really irritated me.
The big reality check for me has been realising the only thing people care about is money.

I’ve never had an issue with her being on a pension as I understand the supports it allows access to are necessary for her functioning, like free psych support, occupational therapist etc but it also grants access to things she does not need, like a minimum wage without working, and disabled parking to say the least.

I have the same disabilities as this woman but I understand I would need to lie about my severity to access a pension- and that doesn’t sit right with me.

Her selfishness and entitlement has really given me the ick and I don’t think it’s worth keeping her as a friend, AITA?

Basically he was saying that it had to cover the whole head in a circular shape to be classified as an afro but I was saying that while that’s true theres different ways it can be trimmed and stuff- it doesn’t need to be in that exact way or lengh to be considered an afro lol. I know it’s a silly discussion and that’s what I thought at the time but he genuinely got extremely upset and very heated with me saying that I wasn’t listening to his perspective whatsoever and that I just kept repeating the same thing-but he just kept yelling “i’m right and your wrong” and I wasn’t even entirely disagreeing with him I was just stating my point.

131,1chgmb1,AITA for leaving without a word to my roommate after dealing with her for months?,"I (20F)  had concerns about my side of the room in our new dorms, so I planned my trip to the hostel early. Sarah(19F), my new roommate, wanted the left side, and I agreed, intending to switch later. I told her I'd rearrange my side to avoid the washroom smell.  

When she showed up two days later, she complained about the arrangement calling it 'unacceptable', but we managed to hash out a new room arrangement after some back and forth (although she wouldn't let me speak). She kept saying how anxious she felt about speaking up, and how she was a people-pleaser. 
 
For the next 10 days, she left her bags unpacked, blocking my cupboards, claiming she'd sort it soon while talking about changing rooms, leaving me unable to access my stuff, yet insisting we'd ""figure it out"", despite having space under her desk.  

After she asked to host a dance party shortly after we met, I expressed discomfort with strangers in our room; later, she unpacked and takes up most of the space so I asked for adjustments she got angry and stormed out after flinging her laundry bag in frustration, yelling “ this is wanted right? U didn’t like the laundry bag?” She finally listens after I tell her it's my room too.  

I adjusted my study habits when she asked, but when I asked for the same, she just got mad about it. I avoided the bathroom due to her lack of hygiene to prevent conflict.  
When I got back from being sick for three weeks, I let my roommate borrow my fairy lights, but when I mentioned her using my stuff too much, especially my extension cord, she took it as mean and hurtful, even though she has her own things.  

She calls me inconsiderate but then claims her own actions as consideration, despite my efforts to accommodate her.  

Next few days she passive-aggressively does things to piss me off, despite it inconveniencing her too.  

She tells me to silence my phone notifications because they annoy her, but she continues to talk loudly on calls till 3 am, won't let me open the blinds cuz the light hurts her, yet ironically stays up late on call and keeps her lights on.  

Fed up with her, I tried to switch rooms, but struggled to find someone willing to swap because of her reputation; when I learned she was going on a trip, I pushed harder and managed to move out the day after she left. Once she left, I moved out, turned in my keys, and never looked back; I still feel conflicted, I'm relieved to be out of that mess, wondering if I handled things wrong and was rude for leaving without a word.

134,1chf34m,WIBTA if I got a new dog?,"Ps. Sorry for my grammar, its 2 am and English isn't my first language.

For background: I already have a dog who's around 6 years old. I got him when he  was 2 months old, and We were inseparable. Until, he started getting skin allergies when he was around two years old. He was suffering, losing his fur, scratching until he bled, so I spend hundreds on skin care, medicine, and vet visits for him. 

I guess all the baths, and meds ended up in him not loving me anymore. He was just scared. No matter what treat I had he would just instantly run the opposite way, he hid under furniture and refused to come out for me, ignored me daily when I tried playing with him, refused to eat when I was the one to fill his bowl so I always had to ask my sister or parents to take the bowl and act as if its they were the ones doing it. 

I thought he would settle down once he was healed so I kept trying to show him that my hands were always empty, and bought him toys and treats. But years went by and he still remained the same way. he basically only looks for me when I'm the only one home family during fireworks or thunder season. It hurts me to see him become a different dog when he's with my family qnd I'm not around.

The problem: After waiting for so long, I want to adopt a new puppy who I can pour all my love to, who won't ignore me or treat me like I'm nuisance or watch me like a hawk thinking that I'm some sort of threat whenever I go into the same room he's in. But, my sister thinks I'm an asshole because I'm 'replacing my dog'.

But, I don't think I'm an asshole because I wouldn't throw him away. I will still buy his food, pay for any future vet visits, and get him new toys and treats once every few weeks. I'll just stop trying to give him unwanted attention, or focing him to be with me when he clearly doesn't want to. I will leave him to my family's love and affection like he wants, and focus on the new little one.

142,1chd9ll,AITA for selling my friend my project car,"A few months ago I sold my 1998 mustang cobra to a friend of mine for realistically about double its value at the time. He understood the market but decided it was a fair price and I am not one to turn down money. But he wanted to pay half up front then the rest in installments. I took 500 off the price and didn’t charge him interest. 

He waited for many months for me to get the car running and driving before buying it and when it did he had me take it to an inspection that I paid for. I learned the car had a bunch of issues I didn’t even know about but he just graduated mechanic school and wanted a project car he could put his skills to the test with and this definitely tested those skills.

I told him the general run down of what the inspector found and he was cool with it and paid me. A few months of payments go by and I told him I found the inspection report tucked away and if he wanted it. I sent him a picture and I guess he never checked up with his own inspector because most of the needed repairs were a shock to him.

Now he has called me saying he wants to discuss the price again now that he knows about these issues. I am not okay with this. What he is paying for the car is now what the car is worth and I’m not looking to get fucked out of a deal. I was only willing to take partial payments because he is a good friend.

144,1chd82z,WIBTA for not selling my friend a piece of machinery?,"# WIBTA for not selling something I said I would?

Hi all - want to gather some thoughts since I am on the fence about it.

My friend and I both share a specific hobby that the machinery required is expensive. My friend who has a small business like me currently does not have this piece of machinery. I have one, but it is older and is starting to act up.

While browsing facebook, I came across a brand new machine for about half off. A whopping deal. I sent it to my friend and we geeked out for it and he went on about how he wished he could afford it. I offered to let him pay me back for it, and I went ahead and picked it up in his truck. I learned after the fact that it would take him about a year/24 months to pay this off.

Well, ever since I picked this up my life has went sideways. I have unexpected equine vet bills, I blew a head gasket on my car, and finances tightened up real quick. I wasn't in a position to rush before, but now I am needing to buy another car (or fix mine) and I owe multiple thousands to the equine vet.

I was just going to silently struggle since i do like to uphold my word, until he became super cynical one day about my work when I was grieving about my friends death that morning. I also asked if i could use a accessory on my machine and he got an attitude with me. This irked me to the point where now I am wanting to consider selling the new machine for market value (i already have a offer) and flipping a profit on it so i don't have to take out a personal loan. I also want to add that I wasnt going to charge him interest on the loan, or above what i paid for it. There is no contract yet.

145,1chd7k6,AITA for asking my best friend for gay porn?,"I’ve been bffs with my best friend since we were babies, and I love him like a brother.

I found out recently that he was bi because he started seeing a mutual friend. I should have seen it coming because he was constantly asking about this mutual friend and they would disappear together for hours at a time when we were hanging out with our friends.

I didn’t think I was homophobic in the slightest, but it definitely threw me off. Neither of them seemed gay at all, and I always thought I’d know if my best friend was gay. We have known each other for 20 years.

But he came out to me specifically and I should have been more encouraging, but I was just shocked. I kept accidentally calling him gay and asking how that’s possible when he’s slept with women and he kept correcting me and saying he was bi.

It was a really uncomfortable conversation, but it ended with him saying that I don’t need to stress because he won’t be “shoving it in my face” and “I’ll hardly know they’re together”. He said he knows it’s a lot and it’s okay if I need time to process. 

And he was right. I did need time to process. Because not only did I find out he was gay, but I also found out he was dating a mutual friend of ours. A male friend.

I have gay friends, but I always knew they were gay, so maybe that’s why it’s different?

My best friends new bf also has a best friend that I’m friends with. I asked how he was taking the news of them dating and he said he had known he was gay for years and he went out of his way to be supportive. He said he has heard all the sex stories, seen him make out with men, and he hypes him on.

I just kind of felt bad because I want to be that supportive friend and I haven’t been that. I talked to my bff and said that I still love him and I’m sorry about the awkwardness. I said I wanted to learn more and be a better advocate for gay people and I think he could help me with that.

He said absolutely. I asked if he would send me gay porn. I said if I was going to have a gay bff, I should know the ins-and-outs of gay sex. We have talked about sex before, and we can still do it. I just need to desensitize myself to gay sex and gay people. I said it would be a good learning opportunity for me.

I was trying to be supportive, but instead he just looked… uncomfortable? He said he doesn’t watch much gay porn, and he’s confused on how that’s going to help me understand gay people.

I was horrified I asked. I tried to explain I thought it would normalize gay people and I didn’t want him to feel like he couldn’t be open with me about sex. He said porn isn’t going to teach you about gay people, a lot of porn is unrealistic, and being gay is about a lot more than just sex.

148,1chd1al,AITA for making my surgery his problem?,"I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for about 2.5 years. We are both in school at the same university.

 In January, I took a learn-to-ski course, and decided to go up the chair lift despite it probably being way ahead of my skill level. Surprise! It was, and I tore my ACL in the process of getting down. It was a really light fall but next thing you know my body was down hill and my leg was uphill with my ski still on my foot. 

I have been dealing with the pain and the physical therapy since January, and am finally getting my reconstruction surgery within the next two weeks!! Yippee!! I asked my boyfriend if he was going to come visit me at all (my guess is that I’ll be lonely and struggle with mobility) and he said no, not until I can come visit him. 

For context, he believed this whole ordeal is my fault (which I guess it is) and that I deserve all of the consequences for choosing to put myself in that position. Anytime I complain about pain, physical therapy, am anxious of the surgery or the recovery process afterward, or get sad because I can’t take part in my physical activities I get the same response - I need to stop complaining because I did this to myself and I don’t deserve sympathy. 

Reddit, is he right? I know I burdened my loved ones by injuring myself but it really wasn’t my intent and now I’m struggling on this journey alone and without his support. 


EDIT: 
I know I just made this post but I want to add some extra context. 

He’s been somewhat supportive - babysitting my activities since he knows I’m in a hurry to get back to them and wants to make sure I don’t make myself worse by going too hard. He also has a professional certification exam on the 29th of May that he needs to and wants to focus on which is why he also won’t come visit (we live 45 mins away from each other and he’s been studying for about 8 hours each day). ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-01,"AITA for making my surgery his problem? I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for about 2.5 years. We are both in school at the same university.

 In January, I took a learn-to-ski course, and decided to go up the chair lift despite it probably being way ahead of my skill level. Surprise! It was, and I tore my ACL in the process of getting down. It was a really light fall but next thing you know my body was down hill and my leg was uphill with my ski still on my foot. 

I have been dealing with the pain and the physical therapy since January, and am finally getting my reconstruction surgery within the next two weeks!! Yippee!!

149,1chd0pl,WIBTA if I confronted my friend over 2 yr old stuff I just found out about?,"I (21F) have this friend we'll call Rosie (21F) and we're both part of a college group with Jasmine (21F) and Annie (22F). Rosie dated a guy from our class named Joe (21M) in late 2022, which is the year this whole thing starts

Around April-May 2022 I had my first kiss and since Rosie was my friend and I was very happy about it I excitedly told her thinking nothing of it. Unfortunately for me the kiss began a situationship that ended around the same time she started dating Joe (Important fact)

Rosie and Joe only dated for like 3 months and ended in pretty bad terms, making Jasmine, Annie and I completely despise the man for his weird behavior towards her. This hatred lasted until about a month ago when I ended up being partnered with Joe for two semester-long projects and realizing he at least puts in the work

Flash forward to last Saturday, I was working on one of these projects with Joe and our two other teammates and since they're all friends and I'm on good terms with them we got distracted and started talking. We entered the topic of relationships and that's when the bomb exploded: After asking me if I had ever dated anyone, Joe proceeded to say he heard about my first kiss

I exploded (pretty disproportionately, I'll admit that). I yelled up and down in disbelief that Rosie had actually told him about it. Joe and I had never spoken at that point and she knew the kiss had become a sensitive topic for me after things ended with that guy, so imo she had no business telling him

Eventually I calmed down, him and I agreed to talk it out later and we continued with the project. And when we did talk it out later he apologized for bringing it up and dropped another bomb on me

Around the first half of that spring semester (Southern Hemisphere, spring semester is Aug-Dec) I figured out Rosie, Jasmine and Annie had a gc without me. They always seemed to be in tune with things I had no idea about, and more than once they slipped a ""I sent it to the gc"" in front of me and my notif-less phone.

After a few months of me keeping quiet about it I was randomly added in a gc with them and was pretty excited about it. Well, a year and a half later Joe told me they only made that new gc bc he saw a comment I made online about feeling excluded and brought it up to Rosie saying how wrong it was. It took HIM, a guy I did not know even knew my name, intervening in the situation for them to make the stupid gc

Again, this is all pretty old info that I found out abt last Saturday, and istg I feel like I have the angel and the devil on my shoulder. On one hand it would feel kinda stupid to make a big deal out of such old stuff (Which is what my parents think) but on the other hand I genuinely think I have a right to be mad at them  and let them know (Which is what one of our teammates think). No, I really have no opinion of my own here bc nothing ever happens to me so I've never been in a situation like this before

So, folks, WIBTA?

150,1chcun4,AITA for not caring bout this Situation ,"AITA for not caring about this situation?
So my fiancé used to be married and we’re still currently waiting for the divorce papers to be sent for some reason, even though it’s been over 2 months. So with that being said of course they still communicate. However I don’t like that they’re not usually talking about the divorce papers . I’ve voiced to him many times how I didn’t like it especially after she sent a “special video” of her work performance, and how he discusses our private situations with her like they’re best friends when he’s told me some foul stories about her.

So, someone had hurt himself and ended up dying, BUT he told me it was HIS brother . Now I only know of the one so I was a bit confused . Come to find out the next day it was actually HER brother . Now, I love him and care about how he feels so of course I’m heartbroken that he’s so upset and hurt that his friend died. But I do not care about the fact that it’s her brother. I understand I may seem like a bitch about it but personally I’m not understanding why he’s still having any contact with her (divorce topic exempt) or her family to begin with.

Secondly I don’t like that fact that she feels comfortable enough to CONSISTENTLY call and text him about everything else but the divorce papers and why they haven’t shown up when everything has been paid for and signed, and the only thing they were waiting for , was for it to be sent .

Now back to topic. So we’re going to drive 9hrs to go to his ex wife’s, brother’s funeral and honestly I don’t know how to feel about it and I don’t want to act out of character at what’s supposed to be a very emotional event. However I feel that it’s an event that we shouldn’t and/or don’t need to be going to. But he wants to so we will.

I just feel like I’m being really insensitive and selfish about it but at the same time I feel like I have every right to be upset and not want to go. I need some outside help so please lmk AITA🤦‍♀️",Asshole,2024-05-01,"AITA for not caring bout this Situation  AITA for not caring about this situation?

151,1chcqpm,AITA for slowly not supporting my friend with the guy she likes and for being upset at her that she's meeting him today? ,"
Im f16, and my friend, Shelle f17 has this person. Let's name him J. In our place we call her relationship with this person MU or when u have mutual understanding of each other's feelings, but you're not ready to put a label on it, which i was okay with the first time. We have this other friend, Yuri f17, she was not so supportive. 

Yuri isn't so supportive of Shelle and J because J is from a school where she knows red flags come from. I don't generalize with her because that's not very nice. I kind of support the idea of Shelle with J because J seems nice, by the way he texts her (Shelle shows me) 

Btw Shelle met J, through valorant, and has been talking to for more or less 2 months. 

But lately Shelle has been acting weird because she seems to be moving too fast into this relationship. They barely know each other and they're already throwing i love yous at each other. Weird but not my business. (again, she shows me her chats) 

The problem is, Shelle isn't allowed to have a boyfriend yet, her mom doesn't know anything about this. her chance at having a boyfriend happens when she's 18, and this is just in 4 months. Last week she invited J to our school, he stayed for a few but Shelle made him go home since we had volleyball training at the time. Okay, nice, she's meeting him at places that is safe.

But today is May 1st in the country we live in, we don't have classes since it's Labor Day. Shelle decides to meet up with J at the place he lives. Without her mother knowing. She asked for permission by using her other friends as an excuse. Yuri and I thought this was getting out of hand and we flooded Shelle with messages as to why we thought this was wrong on so many levels.

In the place we live its not safe to go out by you're especially if you're a young girl. I just think it's not nice that she had to draw her other friends into her situation, because if something bad happens to her or if her mom looks for her, she's gonna look for Shelle at her friends' place. If Shelle's mom finds out she's not at any of her friends' places, who knows what could happen. It's not safe either. They could be blamed if something happens to Shelle. 

I'm just trying to look out for my friend because she tends to give her all when she loves someone, this is very unhealthy and I've tried talking to her about it. Yuri and I have been talking to her about all of this and yet she never listens to us and I'm starting to lose my support for her, I'm very upset at her too, so is Yuri. Am I the asshole? Are we the assholes?
