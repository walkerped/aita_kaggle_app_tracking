0,1cialmw,AITA for talking to my friends about some issues?,"I (15 trans male) and most of my friends (F and NB 14-15) have a friend (14 F) who is a bit problematic. Here‚Äôs a small list of things:
-victimizing
-using others as a personal shield 
-immaturity 
-selfishness 
-anger issues
-threats
-unnecessary drama
-dead naming a friend 
-inability to handle constructive criticism 
-inability to be accountable for actions 
-mention of triggers for multiple individuals. 
I tried to communicate these topics to her, and it was extremely hard to tell her anything. I was trying to tell her as much as I could without angering her. I gave her so much evidence to show her how that affects me and some others, but she denies everything. She also victimized herself during this, telling me that ‚Äúthose people are assholes and they‚Äôre just imagining this!‚Äù. I also tell her to stop using a phrase that involves ending yourself but, she denies it, even after making me cry one time. 

And just when I thought that at least one thing that I said had stuck, she went back to gossiping after I told her ‚Äúplease try not to gossip as much‚Äù. I literally snapped, feeling like she wasn‚Äôt getting how much damage she does. So I told her straight up ‚Äúplease shut up? Has nothing that I said actually gone through your thoughts? I get that this girl did that and you like that boy, but I need you to understand that not everything is about everyone else. You‚Äôre not the center of attention and I and others think that you should contribute to the conversations we have instead of changing the topic‚Äù

Turns out that she did not take it well. She started swearing and calling me slurs and so many combos of swears. She stormed out of the room we were using. I told the others and I felt guilty about snapping at her. I apologized through text and I‚Äôm gonna apologize tomorrow as well. 

I feel really guilty but I also want her to understand some things that make us uncomfortable.

They had adopted a new puppy back in September after their old dog passed away. They went to Florida for 3 months on vacation with the puppy. (It was nice to have the place to ourselves) But now they are back and it's been a month now and I'm going crazy.. am I the asshole for being irritated that they bought another puppy ? Their puppy that they had before the new one is still not fully trained and she likes to play bite and jump still.. I just hope the new puppy doesn't pick up on bad habits .. I do pay rent and it's cheap, so that way we can save for a house down the road.

3,1ci5pd0,WIBTA for charging my brother rent if he doesn‚Äôt have a job,"Long story but basically i moved in with my dad and brother after finding out i was pregnant to save money. My dad ending up moving out without saying anything leaving my fianc√© and I with my 17 year old brother while I just gave birth to my baby. I‚Äôve been taking care of him without question since. Very minimal if any help from my dad. 

Some extra backstory: my grandma gave my brother a car and mine had just broken down so I asked my brother If I could just buy his car for 3k and he could look for a car instead bc I didn‚Äôt really have the time or really want to tbh. He said yes. Two weeks later he borrowed my car and totaled it. I told him no worries I know he doesn‚Äôt have a job so I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to pay for it, but let us use his car when he buys it so we can get groceries, go to work etc. 
He ended up totaling his new car so I saved up and bought myself a used car. I recently got a better job so I‚Äôve been able to do a little more. 

anyways we haven‚Äôt charged him rent at all bc I wanted him to save up and buy himself a car. I‚Äôve actually made a deal with him and until he finds a good job, I‚Äôll give him 300 a month to clean once a week and watch my daughter during doctor appointments or grocery shopping, etc. I told him when he gets a job he can keep doing this and it‚Äôll cover rent or he can stop and pay only 300 for rent. 

But recently he‚Äôs been terrible to me. I feel taken advantage of tbh. He was screaming at me because he just got out of a relationship and he‚Äôs depressed and he feels like when he had a car he could just go anywhere and if I had asked him to go somewhere that he would always take us and he feels like now that I‚Äôm the one with a car we don‚Äôt go anywhere and it‚Äôs not fair. But I always gave him gas money. He can‚Äôt afford to give me anything which is fine, but I can‚Äôt just go to the mall whenever. It‚Äôs a lot of work leaving the house with a toddler and I‚Äôm currently pregnant with severe morning sickness.

4,1ci5ha3,AITA Boss gets in my face,"I live in a cold climate, and it's colder than normal for this time of year. So, 2 weeks ago, it was colder than normal in the store. A repairman was brought in to look at the heating system. The repairman said the system needed a new part, but he recommended a new furnace because the current one was outdated and would continue to need repairs. 

  Bare in mind the building is very old and it's a small shop so I work alone the first half of the week. Trying not to complain, I went to work bundled up to stay warm. Usually, a business around here is at 70¬∞F. I run colder than normal. However, the temperature in the building ran 10-15¬∞F colder than normal for businesses in this area. This resulted in me shivering to stay warm, but I made no complaints about it to my boss.

   He then came in and said that my co-worker who works the second half of the week must have turned on the air conditioning. Even tho I knew the heater was still broken. Tho I said nothing. So, yesterday, he sent me home because he said I can't have u working in here with it being so cold in here right now and ""dressed up like an Eskimo."" 

  He claimed he wanted the part replaced all along that there was a misunderstanding. My suspicion from multiple conversations with customers is that they complained enough about the temperature in the building. So he said they were going to try and get the part in today, and we will call u to come back and finish your shift when it gets replaced.   

  Completely changing his previous story of ""it's not broken."" Having not received a call or a text, I went in today not wanting to do a no-call/no-show. So now we come to today, he comes in the store and replies, ""the temperature went up a few degrees since yesterday"" and I replied in a soft calm voice ""it did go up a few degrees since yesterday."" Even tho the part wasn't replaced because he had shut off the thermostat and it was 35-39¬∞F outside and only 10¬∞F warmer inside.

   To which he got in my face and yelled at me and told me I can go home, and I asked why, and he said ""because u had an attitude and I'm the owner and your not going to talk to me like that."" The whole situation ended up with me in tears because I've never experienced that behavior from an employer, and now I'm not wanting to go back to work tomorrow. 

  Now I don't want to go back to work tomorrow. Would I be in the wrong for being afraid to go back to work because my boss got in my face and yelled at me?

5,1ci5gxl,AITA for cutting down a tree and don't care? ,"AITA for cutting down a tree and don't care?

Long story short.
Neighbors are hoarders.The woman of the house lives inside. Man lives in a shed. Last year a weed in their yard started to grow on our fence line and scared me that it would ruin plumbing and other things on both sides. 

We brought it up to the man on the property and even offered to help cut it down. Man said it's just a chicken tree but eventually said he'll do it. Year later the tree is now tall and has grown through their fence.  Majority of tree is now in our yard. We bought a pole saw just for the purpose to take out tree. 

Without telling BF, I cut it down. I leave it in our yard for BF to cut. He's always talked about using wood cutting as a form of stress relief. So we go get BF a new axe. He chops away and put the tree at the road. 

At this point the male neighbor hasn't been around for weeks if not months. Maybe she kicked him out? 

I leave for the night and get a phone call from BF that the man was mad and said he has planted that tree for his dead brother. BF explains the conversation we had before. Man says he didn't know we were talking about THAT tree. It's the only tree. I don't know about the brothe but the rest is a lie. BF is furious with me saying I should of told him before I cut it. We had been talking about this for a year.

Even after apologizing on the phone, in person, etc. My BF has basically been giving me the cold shoulder. I keep apologizing. He wants me to go talk to woman about everything.

I guess he's okay today. But I'm so disoriented. I don't feel like I need to go talk to her.

This is not being done lightly and is after years of issues with her mother (25F). 

To start, her mother is a good mother, she is caring and kind but is not well off and unfortunately has two other children (1M, 7 months F) to care of and the dad for those two is not around. What triggered this decision is her mother getting evicted after being three months late on her rent in Feb 24. She did not make any effort to ask for help or reach out to me until it was too late. This resulted in my daughter coming to live with me and me having to find schooling for her with three days notice. 

I have also paid all expenses for this schooling in addition to my normal child support alongside food and clothing with no support from her mother aside from my daughter visiting her some weekends when her work schedule allows it. We recently had a discussion about my daughter returning to her mother which resulted in both of us being upset because her mother insisted on two weeks with her and two weeks with me, her current school isn‚Äôt willing to take on part time students and I work from home, so having her at home would result in distractions and potential mistakes. 

I believe I could be the asshole here her mother is a good mother, she just admittedly, is not the greatest with money and has definitely made some mistakes.

However, I cannot leave my daughter to be in a one bedroom apartment with her mother and two other children and by  her mothers own admission, no clothes that fit her.

however the problem started when he gave an instruction that i didn't understand and i asked for clarification, then i stopped the car so that i wouldn't be distracted by this while driving

from there the conversation went like this to the best of my memory:  
me: \*stops the car\*

f: why did you stop

me: i know that you tend to get angry when i ask you to explain things so i decided to stop so that you could tell me what you meant without this escalating since if i keep driving something else might come up

me: like what?

me: i really don't, can you please explain?

15,1ci4kog,AITA Monthly Open Forum May 2024: Rule 4,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

We‚Äôve highlighted some changes to a couple of rules the past few months, so we figured we‚Äôd go with a simple one this month - Rule 4, Never Delete An Active Discussion.

This may be the most straight-forward rule of the sub. In fact, we don‚Äôt even cover it in [our FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) And if you‚Äôve ever taken the time to look, you know we cover a lot!

For the purpose of our sub, a discussion is deemed active for the first 48 hours. Once comments have begun rolling in, we do not permit OPs to delete the thread. Of course, a removal by a moderator for a rule violation is different. But, we sometimes see an OP post and then try to delete once things don‚Äôt appear to be going their way. That‚Äôs a rule violation.

Why is it a violation? If someone has taken the time to read your post and give genuine feedback, it is inconsiderate to dip out early because you don‚Äôt like the responses. You have to be prepared to see comments saying you‚Äôre the asshole in the situation. 

One thing that is sometimes brought up in the monthly forums is why doesn‚Äôt the sub have a karma minimum to post, or some other form of verification. As stated in the rule, throwaway accounts are perfectly fine, for those who want to maintain [some privacy.](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMnhtbTdyMmVyZzByYm9qZ2UwdW1lcW4wMWQyNnVkeGQ4Ym02M2Z2dyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/u5LZOILIojA0AaznHn/giphy.gif)

My dad(57m),my step mom(49f)and I have had a very rocky relationship when i was a child but my last year of hs we grew closer and I thought we had put everything behind us.Since 2024 started, both the parents have been completely rude IMO.My dad has threatened that CPS will take my child more than once for things such as not having outdoor running shoes in the winter.We live in northern Alberta where winters are long and cold.My kid got to go skating for the first time and SM told me I should be ashamed that she didnt learn sooner.My dad jumped on that band wagon real fast.Last weekend she was supposed to go with my dad to see SM.He wanted me to pack her hover board so she could show my SN sister but they also wanted to keep the trip a surprise for my kid.I told them that my kid had a bike accident earlier in the week and her bum still hurt so she might not want to ride the board.They told me to pack it anyway.I had a weird feeling about it so the morning of the day she was supposed to leave i asked her if she was interested in riding her board over the weekend.She said that she doesnt want to ride it because her bum hurts still and she doesnt want to hurt it again by falling.I took her to daycare and waited to hear from my parents.My dad called a couple hours later and reminded me to pack the board.I said that my daughter doesnt want to ride it because of her injury.He said""we all have to do things we dont like"".I was extremely upset with this answer as I knew he would not respect my kid's boundaries.I told him we would be leaving the board at home and he got pissed off and hung up on me.I called one of my sisters and explained everything a.I stayed on the phone with her well my dad tried to call me 14 times texted me asking where to pick her up and showed up at my house ringing the doorbell and pounding on the house,yes the house not the door.He went to my neighbors to try get the extra key and called my BF to get him to tell me he was here.I sat in my room which could not be seen from the windows that were open and had a panic attack on the phone with my sister.He eventually got the hint and asked for a one word response on if my kid was going or not.I said no.The next day I got messages from SM.She told me she was hurt and how could I so on and so forth.I explained a bit of what he did and told her to be mad at him. I still was in a panic from the day before and with previous threats about CPS I knew i should mentally prepare for them to call. She kept trying to guilt me in her messages and I kept telling her I was protecting my kid.I am now debating going no contact with either of them over this whole thing.

19,1ci46as,AITA for planning on moving out after my dad recovers from surgery?,"Throwaway so nobody can link this to me. Im a F18 who moved in with my dad and stepmom around five years ago. At first it was amazing, however now that they have had kids I feel like I don‚Äôt belong. This has added up over time, especially in the last two years. In the last two years my dad hasn‚Äôt paid for a single thing I need, including clothes,medicine, food, etc.

This often leads to us arguing because he says he‚Äôs helping me so much to in my eyes he isn‚Äôt. Especially this year my senior year. He has missed so many important milestones, such as my senior pictures, and 18th birthday for work and his new family. But that aside everything boiled over for me tonight.  

My car has old tires, myself and my stepdad have been telling him this for the past year (the tires are over 5 years old) but he refuses to help me pay for some, my stepdad is now helping me pay after tonight. When I was driving home from work my tire ripped, right next to the rim. even my stepdad said there was no way I could‚Äôve done it without doing damage to the rim which there was no damage after I called him and begged him to come to the house because my dad was nonstop yelling at me not listening to me at all. 

After this my stepdad came over and talked to him and told him to stop and he would cover the tires and left, my dad turned right around and started to yell at me. (my stepdad is a mechanic)

but my dad doesn‚Äôt know yet is after his surgery. I‚Äôm moving out to live with my mom. The only people who know are my stepdad, mom, and grandparents.

My grand parents insist i should just hold out another month, but I genuinely don‚Äôt think I can emotionally. and that‚Äôs where they‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm being an asshole since he‚Äôll just be recovering from a surgery that he‚Äôs needed for months for his health. I‚Äôve told them over and over again he‚Äôs done and Grandmother is starting to understand. My grandfather is still holding firm that I should hold out.

But after tonight and the way he treated me, saying that somehow the tire ripping was my fault it was just the car saying that somehow the tire ripping was my fault it was just the stick that broke the camels back. I love my dad because he‚Äôs my dad but the same time ever since him and my stepmom have had their family. I feel like an outcast. He doesn‚Äôt even try to spend time with me anymore. so my opinion, I‚Äôm not being an asshole moving out after his surgery, but I wanted opinions from people who aren‚Äôt friends and family.

26,1ci3ccy,AITA for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù my roommate . ,"So I‚Äôve been living with 3 roommates for the last year or so . All 3 of us are in recovery and met either in rehab or AA meetings . First roommate we will call John and second roommate we‚Äôll call Jack . Long story short John relapsed at the beginning of this year . Went on a complete bender for about 3 weeks then one day woke up and took off to rehab . He called us two weeks before rent was due and said he had no plans to return . I covered his February rent and needless to say it wrecked me financially . Roommate Jack also had some late fees stack up that I ended up covering . However for the last 3 months Jack has stepped up into helping me cover half of John‚Äôs rent . 

Living with Jack hasn‚Äôt been super ideal . We definitely have different standards of cleanliness and the few times I‚Äôve called out his dishes being in the sink for days he got testy about it . On top of that he‚Äôs not the most financially stable person , meaning he can never really split the cost on furniture  with me , etc . He‚Äôs also never lived on his own and at times it shows . Doesn‚Äôt help check the mail , runs AC too much leaves lights on etc . Our lease on our current spot is up at the end of this month and seeing as how I didn‚Äôt really have any options I told Jack we‚Äôd just get a new spot together . He doesn‚Äôt have the money for the security to deposit so I told him I‚Äôd pay his portion and he could pay me back over time . That on top of his late fees that I‚Äôve already covered means he‚Äôs owing me close to $1000. I‚Äôve been tight financially before and understand it can be hard but I also understand that living on your own means that you have to be able to sustain yourself . I can‚Äôt help but shake the feeling that I‚Äôm carrying another grown man and that doesn‚Äôt sit all the way right with me . 

Now, recently a good friend of mine whom well call Joe ,  I‚Äôve known for five years extended the offer to move in together . His lease at his current spot is a 2 bedroom . His lease ends in June and we plan to get a new apartment together come July 1st. His roommate is moving out in a week and he said I could live there for free all of June (his old roommate plans to cover her portion since she‚Äôs leaving early ) . This is a godsend . Saving that money would be super helpful , plus I‚Äôve known Joe for a long time . We‚Äôve got similar interests and a similar friend group . 

My question is am I the asshole for telling Jack that I‚Äôm gonna be going in a different direction and basically giving him 4 weeks to figure out a new living situation on his own . I‚Äôm pretty sure he can go stay with one of his parents if need be but I can‚Äôt help feeling I‚Äôm abandoning him and leaving him out in the cold. :(

Living with Jack hasn‚Äôt been super ideal . We definitely have different standards of cleanliness and the few times I‚Äôve called out his dishes being in the sink for days he got testy about it . On top of that he‚Äôs not the most financially stable person , meaning he can never really split the cost on furniture  with me , etc . He‚Äôs also never lived on his own and at times it shows . Doesn‚Äôt help check the mail , runs AC too much leaves lights on etc . Our lease on our current spot is up at the end of this month and seeing as how I didn‚Äôt really have any options I told Jack we‚Äôd just get a new spot together . He doesn‚Äôt have the money for the security to deposit so I told him I‚Äôd pay his portion and he could pay me back over time . That on top of his late fees that I‚Äôve already covered means he‚Äôs owing me close to $1000. I‚Äôve been tight financially before and understand it can be hard but I also understand that living on your own means that you have to be able to sustain yourself . I can‚Äôt help but shake the feeling that I‚Äôm carrying another grown man and that doesn‚Äôt sit all the way right with me . 

Now, recently a good friend of mine whom well call Joe ,  I‚Äôve known for five years extended the offer to move in together . His lease at his current spot is a 2 bedroom . His lease ends in June and we plan to get a new apartment together come July 1st. His roommate is moving out in a week and he said I could live there for free all of June (his old roommate plans to cover her portion since she‚Äôs leaving early ) . This is a godsend . Saving that money would be super helpful , plus I‚Äôve known Joe for a long time . We‚Äôve got similar interests and a similar friend group . 

My question is am I the asshole for telling Jack that I‚Äôm gonna be going in a different direction and basically giving him 4 weeks to figure out a new living situation on his own . I‚Äôm pretty sure he can go stay with one of his parents if need be but I can‚Äôt help feeling I‚Äôm abandoning him and leaving him out in the cold. :(

27,1ci3bxb,AITA for scolding my brother for comparing his life to mine? ,"I was doing well at getting past this but it has started to bother me again so it will mention dated issues. To start, I (34f) had a freak reaction to a surgery almost eight years ago that rendered me mute and paralyzed. It was on my nervous system but at my pelvis so this reaction didn't really make sense. Shortly after this reaction my very large extended family all abandoned us and my father left us. There were probably other driving forces but I think I was the main one. Always felt responsible at least. My mother is incredibly mentally abusive and everyone I ask for help doesn't think it's that big a deal, no matter how alarming the conversations. I can't get a caregiver to stay. My disability case worker changes every six months. My doctors refuse to understand what happened to me and are content to leave me as a question mark. I can't scratch my nose, feed or bathe myself, and need help to go to the bathroom. Tl;dr I've had a bad time. 



Up until about a month or two after the Maui fires, my brother (30m) had been living in Maui. He lived on the north side of the island and I think the fires were on the west side. His main sources of income were working on a coffee farm and taking pictures of tourists as they took surf lessons. He lived in a friend's guest house. Far from an awful life, though his best friend died of cancer and other ick. 



We live in western Washington so he would visit often. I think this particular visit was November. I don't recall the rest of the conversation, but he compared the last six months of his life to my 7+ years. I very calmly told him that that was a rude thing to say. He promptly flew off the handle and ended up leaving. I remember being extremely confused by his reaction. My mother was in the room and I was glad that she saw this tantrum, but a few weeks ago she said that he had experienced more loss than I had and when I told her that was rude her response was ""K"", so that. I know I am missing stuff but you get the gist. I don't think I am TA but my mother regularly informs me that I am just wrong about everything so I could be TA. AITA?

This past November she mentioned to me again that she wanted to sell her home and move out here. I warned her not to do it.

They both said they didn't want to do that and she was still dead set on moving to California. 
She said she was going to move back in March.
One day in March i get a call from her, she is on her way to Cali and is actually already in Arizona. 
I asked about her house she said she left it in the care of someone she met and they will pay the mortgage, fix it up, and then sell it for her.. she would get 20k out of it. She moved in with her sister who live out here.

29,1ci2kqu,AITA for telling my sister to stop talking about her wedding,"My sister is going to get married in late July.
The wedding date has been set since August of last year.
I am honestly super happy for her, she was engaged once to a d-bag and they broke up a few months before their wedding.
Now she‚Äòs engaged to someone that really makes her happy and she deserves that, but the Bridezilla was set loose the second the date was fixed.

She‚Äòs always been a little over the top, but this is next level. In the beginning I was really supportive, but it‚Äôs gotten a little out of hand.
First she tells her bridal party (bridesmaids, maid of honor etc.) to learn a specific dance she wanted us to do with her at her wedding. So we did, after work we met up for months and practiced the dance until she was happy. A few weeks ago she decided it was too tacky and told us we won‚Äôt be dancing anymore. We thought ok? But didn‚Äôt say anything.

Since we work together (not the same schedule though + different departments) and live together, we see each other a lot. We share a friendgroup, since she‚Äôs only 2 years older than me.
ALL she ever talks about is her wedding. She has turned into a control freak and even made the invitations herself, because I quote ‚Äûno one will make them as perfect as me.‚Äú and she did, they turned out beautifully.

But now she‚Äòs made a List for her Bridal Shower, her Hen night and also her wedding and everything needs to be followed to a t. 
It‚Äôs just too much, for almost a year I‚Äòve been hearing and listening nonstop about this wedding and every time we go out to have some fun, no one is allowed to talk about anything else.

So a few days ago we went out with our friends and she again just wanted to talk over her wedding details and ask us for opinions on 1000 different things she‚Äòs already asked us 1000 times before and everyone started to feel annoyed. 
Since she is my sister I told her to just enjoy the night and finish her last sentence about the wedding and stop talking about it because we couldn‚Äôt hear it anymore.
She was pissed and took off once she realized everyone felt the same way as I did.

I (M14) have two siblings (F12 and F15). I will admit, I haven't really been the best at school. I try, of course, but I average like a 2.5-2.8 most semesters. My sisters have always been better. My younger sister is basically straight A's (because middle school's easy) and my older sister has a mix of B pluses and As. 

  
Well, last week, my dad checked up on my grades (he does so every Friday for some reason) he saw i had most 83s-90s, so he congratulated me with 250 in cash. Obviously i was really excited and he checkedc up on my sisters grades too. For one thing, my dad has never rewarded any of us for grades. I thought it was just a one time thing for me, and that made me even more excited. 

  
Well, on Monday, after school, at around 5 ish, my sisters burst into my room, because they wanted me to show them theres. My dad was in there, and he was presenting a gift for my sisters. In short, they had $1500 each to remodel their bedrooms. Like as in they just have the money, and can spend it on anything room related. Not gonna lie, i was kind of mad they got 6x my amount, but my dad said it was for ""all the years of consistent good effort.""

32,1ci1m8r,AITA for throwing out a sentimental item left behind?,"Last year I allowed someone to move into my house. Let‚Äôs just say things did not end up well at all. 
Early into her stay here, she found an item that had been her late grandfathers.  She was very excited to have found it and said she thought she had lost it for good.  She didn‚Äôt want to keep it in her room so against my advisement, stored it in my living room wardrobe where I keep the coats. I warned her about putting it in there as she most likely forget it was in there. Sure enough, after things turned bad between us and she moved out she left it behind along with some other items she was clearly abandoning for me to dispose of.   I asked her if she had left anything behind she still wanted and she said no, there was nothing.  I waited 30 days before disposing of everything as required by law, except that sentimental item.  I‚Äôve held onto that sentimental item for a over 90 days until it was clear she had no intention of even trying to solve things between us and preserve our friendship.   I‚Äôm pretty sure if she ever does remember she left that item behind she‚Äôll assume I trashed it immediately out of anger because she believes she is always the victim and the world is nothing but horrible people. 

I wouldn‚Äôt feel bad throwing it out since she‚Äôs had 90 days to reclaim it, she was specifically asked if there was anything she left behind she wanted still, and she was warned against storing it in a wardrobe that was not her storage area instead of her room where it would have been safe and not forgotten. 

Would throwing it away or donating it be an Ahole move knowing if she remembered it she‚Äôd want it back?  I feel like I‚Äôve done my due diligence as far as any responsibility goes, but I shouldn‚Äôt be responsible to keep track of her precious items.  
To note, the only reason I can come up with keeping it I s as a bargaining chip to recover money she owes me she refuses to pay, but I think I‚Äôd rather just take the loss and be done with her, and holding it to exchange for money later seems like the Ahole move to hold it ransom like that.  


Edit: all I needed was a few people to say Ahole move to toss it and that sorted my head right quick.  I realized I would be acting out of anger and stooping to her level.  I considered how I would feel if the places were swapped, and while I‚Äôm confident she‚Äôd throw my sentimental item away without a second thought, I‚Äôm going to be the bigger person and I‚Äôve contacted a family member who will pick it up and store it for her.
