0,1cialmw,AITA for talking to my friends about some issues?,"I (15 trans male) and most of my friends (F and NB 14-15) have a friend (14 F) who is a bit problematic. Here‚Äôs a small list of things:
-victimizing
-using others as a personal shield 
-immaturity 
-selfishness 
-anger issues
-threats
-unnecessary drama
-dead naming a friend 
-inability to handle constructive criticism 
-inability to be accountable for actions 
-mention of triggers for multiple individuals. 
I tried to communicate these topics to her, and it was extremely hard to tell her anything. I was trying to tell her as much as I could without angering her. I gave her so much evidence to show her how that affects me and some others, but she denies everything. She also victimized herself during this, telling me that ‚Äúthose people are assholes and they‚Äôre just imagining this!‚Äù. I also tell her to stop using a phrase that involves ending yourself but, she denies it, even after making me cry one time. 

And just when I thought that at least one thing that I said had stuck, she went back to gossiping after I told her ‚Äúplease try not to gossip as much‚Äù. I literally snapped, feeling like she wasn‚Äôt getting how much damage she does. So I told her straight up ‚Äúplease shut up? Has nothing that I said actually gone through your thoughts? I get that this girl did that and you like that boy, but I need you to understand that not everything is about everyone else. You‚Äôre not the center of attention and I and others think that you should contribute to the conversations we have instead of changing the topic‚Äù

Turns out that she did not take it well. She started swearing and calling me slurs and so many combos of swears. She stormed out of the room we were using. I told the others and I felt guilty about snapping at her. I apologized through text and I‚Äôm gonna apologize tomorrow as well. 

I feel really guilty but I also want her to understand some things that make us uncomfortable.

They had adopted a new puppy back in September after their old dog passed away. They went to Florida for 3 months on vacation with the puppy. (It was nice to have the place to ourselves) But now they are back and it's been a month now and I'm going crazy.. am I the asshole for being irritated that they bought another puppy ? Their puppy that they had before the new one is still not fully trained and she likes to play bite and jump still.. I just hope the new puppy doesn't pick up on bad habits .. I do pay rent and it's cheap, so that way we can save for a house down the road.

3,1ci5pd0,WIBTA for charging my brother rent if he doesn‚Äôt have a job,"Long story but basically i moved in with my dad and brother after finding out i was pregnant to save money. My dad ending up moving out without saying anything leaving my fianc√© and I with my 17 year old brother while I just gave birth to my baby. I‚Äôve been taking care of him without question since. Very minimal if any help from my dad. 

Some extra backstory: my grandma gave my brother a car and mine had just broken down so I asked my brother If I could just buy his car for 3k and he could look for a car instead bc I didn‚Äôt really have the time or really want to tbh. He said yes. Two weeks later he borrowed my car and totaled it. I told him no worries I know he doesn‚Äôt have a job so I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to pay for it, but let us use his car when he buys it so we can get groceries, go to work etc. 
He ended up totaling his new car so I saved up and bought myself a used car. I recently got a better job so I‚Äôve been able to do a little more. 

anyways we haven‚Äôt charged him rent at all bc I wanted him to save up and buy himself a car. I‚Äôve actually made a deal with him and until he finds a good job, I‚Äôll give him 300 a month to clean once a week and watch my daughter during doctor appointments or grocery shopping, etc. I told him when he gets a job he can keep doing this and it‚Äôll cover rent or he can stop and pay only 300 for rent. 

But recently he‚Äôs been terrible to me. I feel taken advantage of tbh. He was screaming at me because he just got out of a relationship and he‚Äôs depressed and he feels like when he had a car he could just go anywhere and if I had asked him to go somewhere that he would always take us and he feels like now that I‚Äôm the one with a car we don‚Äôt go anywhere and it‚Äôs not fair. But I always gave him gas money. He can‚Äôt afford to give me anything which is fine, but I can‚Äôt just go to the mall whenever. It‚Äôs a lot of work leaving the house with a toddler and I‚Äôm currently pregnant with severe morning sickness.

4,1ci5ha3,AITA Boss gets in my face,"I live in a cold climate, and it's colder than normal for this time of year. So, 2 weeks ago, it was colder than normal in the store. A repairman was brought in to look at the heating system. The repairman said the system needed a new part, but he recommended a new furnace because the current one was outdated and would continue to need repairs. 

  Bare in mind the building is very old and it's a small shop so I work alone the first half of the week. Trying not to complain, I went to work bundled up to stay warm. Usually, a business around here is at 70¬∞F. I run colder than normal. However, the temperature in the building ran 10-15¬∞F colder than normal for businesses in this area. This resulted in me shivering to stay warm, but I made no complaints about it to my boss.

   He then came in and said that my co-worker who works the second half of the week must have turned on the air conditioning. Even tho I knew the heater was still broken. Tho I said nothing. So, yesterday, he sent me home because he said I can't have u working in here with it being so cold in here right now and ""dressed up like an Eskimo."" 

  He claimed he wanted the part replaced all along that there was a misunderstanding. My suspicion from multiple conversations with customers is that they complained enough about the temperature in the building. So he said they were going to try and get the part in today, and we will call u to come back and finish your shift when it gets replaced.   

  Completely changing his previous story of ""it's not broken."" Having not received a call or a text, I went in today not wanting to do a no-call/no-show. So now we come to today, he comes in the store and replies, ""the temperature went up a few degrees since yesterday"" and I replied in a soft calm voice ""it did go up a few degrees since yesterday."" Even tho the part wasn't replaced because he had shut off the thermostat and it was 35-39¬∞F outside and only 10¬∞F warmer inside.

   To which he got in my face and yelled at me and told me I can go home, and I asked why, and he said ""because u had an attitude and I'm the owner and your not going to talk to me like that."" The whole situation ended up with me in tears because I've never experienced that behavior from an employer, and now I'm not wanting to go back to work tomorrow. 

  Now I don't want to go back to work tomorrow. Would I be in the wrong for being afraid to go back to work because my boss got in my face and yelled at me?

5,1ci5gxl,AITA for cutting down a tree and don't care? ,"AITA for cutting down a tree and don't care?

Long story short.
Neighbors are hoarders.The woman of the house lives inside. Man lives in a shed. Last year a weed in their yard started to grow on our fence line and scared me that it would ruin plumbing and other things on both sides. 

We brought it up to the man on the property and even offered to help cut it down. Man said it's just a chicken tree but eventually said he'll do it. Year later the tree is now tall and has grown through their fence.  Majority of tree is now in our yard. We bought a pole saw just for the purpose to take out tree. 

Without telling BF, I cut it down. I leave it in our yard for BF to cut. He's always talked about using wood cutting as a form of stress relief. So we go get BF a new axe. He chops away and put the tree at the road. 

At this point the male neighbor hasn't been around for weeks if not months. Maybe she kicked him out? 

I leave for the night and get a phone call from BF that the man was mad and said he has planted that tree for his dead brother. BF explains the conversation we had before. Man says he didn't know we were talking about THAT tree. It's the only tree. I don't know about the brothe but the rest is a lie. BF is furious with me saying I should of told him before I cut it. We had been talking about this for a year.

Even after apologizing on the phone, in person, etc. My BF has basically been giving me the cold shoulder. I keep apologizing. He wants me to go talk to woman about everything.

I guess he's okay today. But I'm so disoriented. I don't feel like I need to go talk to her.

This is not being done lightly and is after years of issues with her mother (25F). 

To start, her mother is a good mother, she is caring and kind but is not well off and unfortunately has two other children (1M, 7 months F) to care of and the dad for those two is not around. What triggered this decision is her mother getting evicted after being three months late on her rent in Feb 24. She did not make any effort to ask for help or reach out to me until it was too late. This resulted in my daughter coming to live with me and me having to find schooling for her with three days notice. 

I have also paid all expenses for this schooling in addition to my normal child support alongside food and clothing with no support from her mother aside from my daughter visiting her some weekends when her work schedule allows it. We recently had a discussion about my daughter returning to her mother which resulted in both of us being upset because her mother insisted on two weeks with her and two weeks with me, her current school isn‚Äôt willing to take on part time students and I work from home, so having her at home would result in distractions and potential mistakes. 

I believe I could be the asshole here her mother is a good mother, she just admittedly, is not the greatest with money and has definitely made some mistakes.

However, I cannot leave my daughter to be in a one bedroom apartment with her mother and two other children and by  her mothers own admission, no clothes that fit her.

however the problem started when he gave an instruction that i didn't understand and i asked for clarification, then i stopped the car so that i wouldn't be distracted by this while driving

from there the conversation went like this to the best of my memory:  
me: \*stops the car\*

f: why did you stop

me: i know that you tend to get angry when i ask you to explain things so i decided to stop so that you could tell me what you meant without this escalating since if i keep driving something else might come up

me: like what?

me: i really don't, can you please explain?

15,1ci4kog,AITA Monthly Open Forum May 2024: Rule 4,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

We‚Äôve highlighted some changes to a couple of rules the past few months, so we figured we‚Äôd go with a simple one this month - Rule 4, Never Delete An Active Discussion.

This may be the most straight-forward rule of the sub. In fact, we don‚Äôt even cover it in [our FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) And if you‚Äôve ever taken the time to look, you know we cover a lot!

For the purpose of our sub, a discussion is deemed active for the first 48 hours. Once comments have begun rolling in, we do not permit OPs to delete the thread. Of course, a removal by a moderator for a rule violation is different. But, we sometimes see an OP post and then try to delete once things don‚Äôt appear to be going their way. That‚Äôs a rule violation.

Why is it a violation? If someone has taken the time to read your post and give genuine feedback, it is inconsiderate to dip out early because you don‚Äôt like the responses. You have to be prepared to see comments saying you‚Äôre the asshole in the situation. 

One thing that is sometimes brought up in the monthly forums is why doesn‚Äôt the sub have a karma minimum to post, or some other form of verification. As stated in the rule, throwaway accounts are perfectly fine, for those who want to maintain [some privacy.](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMnhtbTdyMmVyZzByYm9qZ2UwdW1lcW4wMWQyNnVkeGQ4Ym02M2Z2dyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/u5LZOILIojA0AaznHn/giphy.gif)

My dad(57m),my step mom(49f)and I have had a very rocky relationship when i was a child but my last year of hs we grew closer and I thought we had put everything behind us.Since 2024 started, both the parents have been completely rude IMO.My dad has threatened that CPS will take my child more than once for things such as not having outdoor running shoes in the winter.We live in northern Alberta where winters are long and cold.My kid got to go skating for the first time and SM told me I should be ashamed that she didnt learn sooner.My dad jumped on that band wagon real fast.Last weekend she was supposed to go with my dad to see SM.He wanted me to pack her hover board so she could show my SN sister but they also wanted to keep the trip a surprise for my kid.I told them that my kid had a bike accident earlier in the week and her bum still hurt so she might not want to ride the board.They told me to pack it anyway.I had a weird feeling about it so the morning of the day she was supposed to leave i asked her if she was interested in riding her board over the weekend.She said that she doesnt want to ride it because her bum hurts still and she doesnt want to hurt it again by falling.I took her to daycare and waited to hear from my parents.My dad called a couple hours later and reminded me to pack the board.I said that my daughter doesnt want to ride it because of her injury.He said""we all have to do things we dont like"".I was extremely upset with this answer as I knew he would not respect my kid's boundaries.I told him we would be leaving the board at home and he got pissed off and hung up on me.I called one of my sisters and explained everything a.I stayed on the phone with her well my dad tried to call me 14 times texted me asking where to pick her up and showed up at my house ringing the doorbell and pounding on the house,yes the house not the door.He went to my neighbors to try get the extra key and called my BF to get him to tell me he was here.I sat in my room which could not be seen from the windows that were open and had a panic attack on the phone with my sister.He eventually got the hint and asked for a one word response on if my kid was going or not.I said no.The next day I got messages from SM.She told me she was hurt and how could I so on and so forth.I explained a bit of what he did and told her to be mad at him. I still was in a panic from the day before and with previous threats about CPS I knew i should mentally prepare for them to call. She kept trying to guilt me in her messages and I kept telling her I was protecting my kid.I am now debating going no contact with either of them over this whole thing.

19,1ci46as,AITA for planning on moving out after my dad recovers from surgery?,"Throwaway so nobody can link this to me. Im a F18 who moved in with my dad and stepmom around five years ago. At first it was amazing, however now that they have had kids I feel like I don‚Äôt belong. This has added up over time, especially in the last two years. In the last two years my dad hasn‚Äôt paid for a single thing I need, including clothes,medicine, food, etc.

This often leads to us arguing because he says he‚Äôs helping me so much to in my eyes he isn‚Äôt. Especially this year my senior year. He has missed so many important milestones, such as my senior pictures, and 18th birthday for work and his new family. But that aside everything boiled over for me tonight.  

My car has old tires, myself and my stepdad have been telling him this for the past year (the tires are over 5 years old) but he refuses to help me pay for some, my stepdad is now helping me pay after tonight. When I was driving home from work my tire ripped, right next to the rim. even my stepdad said there was no way I could‚Äôve done it without doing damage to the rim which there was no damage after I called him and begged him to come to the house because my dad was nonstop yelling at me not listening to me at all. 

After this my stepdad came over and talked to him and told him to stop and he would cover the tires and left, my dad turned right around and started to yell at me. (my stepdad is a mechanic)

but my dad doesn‚Äôt know yet is after his surgery. I‚Äôm moving out to live with my mom. The only people who know are my stepdad, mom, and grandparents.

My grand parents insist i should just hold out another month, but I genuinely don‚Äôt think I can emotionally. and that‚Äôs where they‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm being an asshole since he‚Äôll just be recovering from a surgery that he‚Äôs needed for months for his health. I‚Äôve told them over and over again he‚Äôs done and Grandmother is starting to understand. My grandfather is still holding firm that I should hold out.

But after tonight and the way he treated me, saying that somehow the tire ripping was my fault it was just the car saying that somehow the tire ripping was my fault it was just the stick that broke the camels back. I love my dad because he‚Äôs my dad but the same time ever since him and my stepmom have had their family. I feel like an outcast. He doesn‚Äôt even try to spend time with me anymore. so my opinion, I‚Äôm not being an asshole moving out after his surgery, but I wanted opinions from people who aren‚Äôt friends and family.

26,1ci3ccy,AITA for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù my roommate . ,"So I‚Äôve been living with 3 roommates for the last year or so . All 3 of us are in recovery and met either in rehab or AA meetings . First roommate we will call John and second roommate we‚Äôll call Jack . Long story short John relapsed at the beginning of this year . Went on a complete bender for about 3 weeks then one day woke up and took off to rehab . He called us two weeks before rent was due and said he had no plans to return . I covered his February rent and needless to say it wrecked me financially . Roommate Jack also had some late fees stack up that I ended up covering . However for the last 3 months Jack has stepped up into helping me cover half of John‚Äôs rent . 

Living with Jack hasn‚Äôt been super ideal . We definitely have different standards of cleanliness and the few times I‚Äôve called out his dishes being in the sink for days he got testy about it . On top of that he‚Äôs not the most financially stable person , meaning he can never really split the cost on furniture  with me , etc . He‚Äôs also never lived on his own and at times it shows . Doesn‚Äôt help check the mail , runs AC too much leaves lights on etc . Our lease on our current spot is up at the end of this month and seeing as how I didn‚Äôt really have any options I told Jack we‚Äôd just get a new spot together . He doesn‚Äôt have the money for the security to deposit so I told him I‚Äôd pay his portion and he could pay me back over time . That on top of his late fees that I‚Äôve already covered means he‚Äôs owing me close to $1000. I‚Äôve been tight financially before and understand it can be hard but I also understand that living on your own means that you have to be able to sustain yourself . I can‚Äôt help but shake the feeling that I‚Äôm carrying another grown man and that doesn‚Äôt sit all the way right with me . 

Now, recently a good friend of mine whom well call Joe ,  I‚Äôve known for five years extended the offer to move in together . His lease at his current spot is a 2 bedroom . His lease ends in June and we plan to get a new apartment together come July 1st. His roommate is moving out in a week and he said I could live there for free all of June (his old roommate plans to cover her portion since she‚Äôs leaving early ) . This is a godsend . Saving that money would be super helpful , plus I‚Äôve known Joe for a long time . We‚Äôve got similar interests and a similar friend group . 

My question is am I the asshole for telling Jack that I‚Äôm gonna be going in a different direction and basically giving him 4 weeks to figure out a new living situation on his own . I‚Äôm pretty sure he can go stay with one of his parents if need be but I can‚Äôt help feeling I‚Äôm abandoning him and leaving him out in the cold. :(

Living with Jack hasn‚Äôt been super ideal . We definitely have different standards of cleanliness and the few times I‚Äôve called out his dishes being in the sink for days he got testy about it . On top of that he‚Äôs not the most financially stable person , meaning he can never really split the cost on furniture  with me , etc . He‚Äôs also never lived on his own and at times it shows . Doesn‚Äôt help check the mail , runs AC too much leaves lights on etc . Our lease on our current spot is up at the end of this month and seeing as how I didn‚Äôt really have any options I told Jack we‚Äôd just get a new spot together . He doesn‚Äôt have the money for the security to deposit so I told him I‚Äôd pay his portion and he could pay me back over time . That on top of his late fees that I‚Äôve already covered means he‚Äôs owing me close to $1000. I‚Äôve been tight financially before and understand it can be hard but I also understand that living on your own means that you have to be able to sustain yourself . I can‚Äôt help but shake the feeling that I‚Äôm carrying another grown man and that doesn‚Äôt sit all the way right with me . 

Now, recently a good friend of mine whom well call Joe ,  I‚Äôve known for five years extended the offer to move in together . His lease at his current spot is a 2 bedroom . His lease ends in June and we plan to get a new apartment together come July 1st. His roommate is moving out in a week and he said I could live there for free all of June (his old roommate plans to cover her portion since she‚Äôs leaving early ) . This is a godsend . Saving that money would be super helpful , plus I‚Äôve known Joe for a long time . We‚Äôve got similar interests and a similar friend group . 

My question is am I the asshole for telling Jack that I‚Äôm gonna be going in a different direction and basically giving him 4 weeks to figure out a new living situation on his own . I‚Äôm pretty sure he can go stay with one of his parents if need be but I can‚Äôt help feeling I‚Äôm abandoning him and leaving him out in the cold. :(

27,1ci3bxb,AITA for scolding my brother for comparing his life to mine? ,"I was doing well at getting past this but it has started to bother me again so it will mention dated issues. To start, I (34f) had a freak reaction to a surgery almost eight years ago that rendered me mute and paralyzed. It was on my nervous system but at my pelvis so this reaction didn't really make sense. Shortly after this reaction my very large extended family all abandoned us and my father left us. There were probably other driving forces but I think I was the main one. Always felt responsible at least. My mother is incredibly mentally abusive and everyone I ask for help doesn't think it's that big a deal, no matter how alarming the conversations. I can't get a caregiver to stay. My disability case worker changes every six months. My doctors refuse to understand what happened to me and are content to leave me as a question mark. I can't scratch my nose, feed or bathe myself, and need help to go to the bathroom. Tl;dr I've had a bad time. 



Up until about a month or two after the Maui fires, my brother (30m) had been living in Maui. He lived on the north side of the island and I think the fires were on the west side. His main sources of income were working on a coffee farm and taking pictures of tourists as they took surf lessons. He lived in a friend's guest house. Far from an awful life, though his best friend died of cancer and other ick. 



We live in western Washington so he would visit often. I think this particular visit was November. I don't recall the rest of the conversation, but he compared the last six months of his life to my 7+ years. I very calmly told him that that was a rude thing to say. He promptly flew off the handle and ended up leaving. I remember being extremely confused by his reaction. My mother was in the room and I was glad that she saw this tantrum, but a few weeks ago she said that he had experienced more loss than I had and when I told her that was rude her response was ""K"", so that. I know I am missing stuff but you get the gist. I don't think I am TA but my mother regularly informs me that I am just wrong about everything so I could be TA. AITA?

The wedding date has been set since August of last year.
I am honestly super happy for her, she was engaged once to a d-bag and they broke up a few months before their wedding.
Now she‚Äòs engaged to someone that really makes her happy and she deserves that, but the Bridezilla was set loose the second the date was fixed.

She‚Äòs always been a little over the top, but this is next level. In the beginning I was really supportive, but it‚Äôs gotten a little out of hand.
First she tells her bridal party (bridesmaids, maid of honor etc.) to learn a specific dance she wanted us to do with her at her wedding. So we did, after work we met up for months and practiced the dance until she was happy. A few weeks ago she decided it was too tacky and told us we won‚Äôt be dancing anymore. We thought ok? But didn‚Äôt say anything.

Since we work together (not the same schedule though + different departments) and live together, we see each other a lot. We share a friendgroup, since she‚Äôs only 2 years older than me.
ALL she ever talks about is her wedding. She has turned into a control freak and even made the invitations herself, because I quote ‚Äûno one will make them as perfect as me.‚Äú and she did, they turned out beautifully.

But now she‚Äòs made a List for her Bridal Shower, her Hen night and also her wedding and everything needs to be followed to a t. 
It‚Äôs just too much, for almost a year I‚Äòve been hearing and listening nonstop about this wedding and every time we go out to have some fun, no one is allowed to talk about anything else.

So a few days ago we went out with our friends and she again just wanted to talk over her wedding details and ask us for opinions on 1000 different things she‚Äòs already asked us 1000 times before and everyone started to feel annoyed. 
Since she is my sister I told her to just enjoy the night and finish her last sentence about the wedding and stop talking about it because we couldn‚Äôt hear it anymore.

32,1ci1m8r,AITA for throwing out a sentimental item left behind?,"Last year I allowed someone to move into my house. Let‚Äôs just say things did not end up well at all. 
Early into her stay here, she found an item that had been her late grandfathers.  She was very excited to have found it and said she thought she had lost it for good.  She didn‚Äôt want to keep it in her room so against my advisement, stored it in my living room wardrobe where I keep the coats. I warned her about putting it in there as she most likely forget it was in there. Sure enough, after things turned bad between us and she moved out she left it behind along with some other items she was clearly abandoning for me to dispose of.   I asked her if she had left anything behind she still wanted and she said no, there was nothing.  I waited 30 days before disposing of everything as required by law, except that sentimental item.  I‚Äôve held onto that sentimental item for a over 90 days until it was clear she had no intention of even trying to solve things between us and preserve our friendship.   I‚Äôm pretty sure if she ever does remember she left that item behind she‚Äôll assume I trashed it immediately out of anger because she believes she is always the victim and the world is nothing but horrible people. 

I wouldn‚Äôt feel bad throwing it out since she‚Äôs had 90 days to reclaim it, she was specifically asked if there was anything she left behind she wanted still, and she was warned against storing it in a wardrobe that was not her storage area instead of her room where it would have been safe and not forgotten. 

Would throwing it away or donating it be an Ahole move knowing if she remembered it she‚Äôd want it back?  I feel like I‚Äôve done my due diligence as far as any responsibility goes, but I shouldn‚Äôt be responsible to keep track of her precious items.  
To note, the only reason I can come up with keeping it I s as a bargaining chip to recover money she owes me she refuses to pay, but I think I‚Äôd rather just take the loss and be done with her, and holding it to exchange for money later seems like the Ahole move to hold it ransom like that.  


Edit: all I needed was a few people to say Ahole move to toss it and that sorted my head right quick.  I realized I would be acting out of anger and stooping to her level.  I considered how I would feel if the places were swapped, and while I‚Äôm confident she‚Äôd throw my sentimental item away without a second thought, I‚Äôm going to be the bigger person and I‚Äôve contacted a family member who will pick it up and store it for her.

33,1ciupuq,AITA for wanting to move out of the apartment I convinced my roomies of getting? ,"1 (19) F just started living abroad for a diploma. I started out living on a homestay but being out of the country and away from my parents made me want to be independent and live on my own.
At school I knew some friends that come from the same country that I do and I thought it would be a good idea to move in together and split rent. Everything started alright until I noticed that they don't clean after themselves. Dishes? Never washed. Hairs in the bathroom floor? Rotting food on the fridge? You name it. I was basically their nanny and was picking up after themselves, and every time I mentioned that or really, anything else, they would say that that's not how they do it back home. This would all be livable and tolerable if it wasn't for one specific roommate. I'll call her Kiara (24) F, she's the most passive agresive person I know, always giving backhanded comments and always making a drama out of everything. She's also extremely jealous of me. We both work/study on a very competitive field and I have (by mere luck) been more successful recently while she on the other hand hasn't as much. But every time something good happens in my life, for example, getting a boyfriend, getting a job, or winning a contest, it constitutes a full-on mental breakdown for her. It's emotionally draining, she's also very emotionally dependent on me even tho I just met her six months. She's demanding for me to always be 24/7 with her. I just wake up? If I don't talk with her immediately it means that I don't like her. I hang out with literally anyone else? Why didn't I invited her? And she always does it in that backhanded way too. She says ""Oh I'm just gonna stay all weekend at home and rot"" or ""Have fun with your little friends"". She has a mental breakdown every other week and brings me and my roommates down with her every single time. And when we try to comfort her she always has something to say, always a ""but this"" to what we say. She truly doesn't feel like she's capable of anything and every time we say that she is she doesn't believe us and makes us feel guilty for it(?). And honestly after so much of this I really don't wanna be with her anymore, I'm drained, I'm angry and I only have six months left in this city and I want to actually enjoy my home and not feel like I'm walking in eggshells all the time. The thing is, rent is divided by the four of us, and when I pass the contract to another one of our roomies l'm considering that what happens next is none of my business, wether they get a new roomie or move out I think it's their decision. My other 2 roomies (27) M and
(28) M have no problem with getting a new roomie but Kiara is over it, right now she's doing the silent treatment to me and giving her usual backhanded comments about the situation cause she doesn't wanna get a new roomie nor split the rent by 3 instead of 4. And I get it's a difficult thing to do and I feel sorry for them but at the same time their actions led me to move away.

At school I knew some friends that come from the same country that I do and I thought it would be a good idea to move in together and split rent. Everything started alright until I noticed that they don't clean after themselves. Dishes? Never washed. Hairs in the bathroom floor? Rotting food on the fridge? You name it. I was basically their nanny and was picking up after themselves, and every time I mentioned that or really, anything else, they would say that that's not how they do it back home. This would all be livable and tolerable if it wasn't for one specific roommate. I'll call her Kiara (24) F, she's the most passive agresive person I know, always giving backhanded comments and always making a drama out of everything. She's also extremely jealous of me. We both work/study on a very competitive field and I have (by mere luck) been more successful recently while she on the other hand hasn't as much. But every time something good happens in my life, for example, getting a boyfriend, getting a job, or winning a contest, it constitutes a full-on mental breakdown for her. It's emotionally draining, she's also very emotionally dependent on me even tho I just met her six months. She's demanding for me to always be 24/7 with her. I just wake up? If I don't talk with her immediately it means that I don't like her. I hang out with literally anyone else? Why didn't I invited her? And she always does it in that backhanded way too. She says ""Oh I'm just gonna stay all weekend at home and rot"" or ""Have fun with your little friends"". She has a mental breakdown every other week and brings me and my roommates down with her every single time. And when we try to comfort her she always has something to say, always a ""but this"" to what we say. She truly doesn't feel like she's capable of anything and every time we say that she is she doesn't believe us and makes us feel guilty for it(?). And honestly after so much of this I really don't wanna be with her anymore, I'm drained, I'm angry and I only have six months left in this city and I want to actually enjoy my home and not feel like I'm walking in eggshells all the time. The thing is, rent is divided by the four of us, and when I pass the contract to another one of our roomies l'm considering that what happens next is none of my business, wether they get a new roomie or move out I think it's their decision. My other 2 roomies (27) M and
(28) M have no problem with getting a new roomie but Kiara is over it, right now she's doing the silent treatment to me and giving her usual backhanded comments about the situation cause she doesn't wanna get a new roomie nor split the rent by 3 instead of 4. And I get it's a difficult thing to do and I feel sorry for them but at the same time their actions led me to move away. What should I do?",0.0,0.02312392182648182,0,1
34,1ciuk88,AITA for screaming at my sister‚Äôs babysitter?,"I (16f) grew up in an immigrant family and have a little sister with special needs. I was raised by a single mother since my parents got divorced when I was little and my father went no contact. 

 So all this to say that my mom doesn‚Äôt have much time for me. I am not okay with this, and never will be, but it‚Äôs not like I have much choice in the matter, so I just dealt with it. 

I always want to spend time with my mom and jump at every opportunity to, and when she found a babysitter of sorts (I say of sorts because this is not a random teen we found online, this is a grown woman who works for a company specializing in situations like this), I was hopeful that she would have more time for me.

It would have been like that, if the woman had actually done her job. In her almost year long employment (we kept her because it was better than nothing), she cancelled 37 times and was late over 30 minutes 109 times.

She was a pleasant enough woman so I didn‚Äôt exactly dislike her, but I was prone to being annoyed by her inability to be professional. 

Or that was at the beginning, but as time went on, I slowly started to resent her because she canceled or was late literally every single time my mom and I planned to hang out.

A list of everything I wasn‚Äôt able to do with my mom because she was late/cancelled:
Museum-4
Opera-1
Musical-1
Movie-7
Park-12
Mall-4
Other-13

So I started to resent her, but I stayed pleasant because my sister liked her. Until one day, I woke up to her and my mom having an argument.

Please note that I had been sick for several days with a fever, so I was much more emotional than usual, in addition to the stress of missing so much school.

I woke up to go to the restroom and they were arguing, and the gist of it was that my mom was mad that she was late again, and the woman was mad because she‚Äôs had to wait for my mom before as well, and the way my mom was speaking to her was unprofessional and disrespectful.

I then told her that in order for others to be respectful, you actually had to be respectable, and in order for others to be professional, you had to be as well. She rolled her eyes at me and told me that it was not my business.

I then lost my temper and screamed at her that it was completely my business because her incompetence had cost me every single thing I had planned with my mom. It‚Äôs almost the truth, since there have been only 3 instances (that I can remember) of me actually being able to do what I had planned with my mom.

She then said that I had no right to talk to her that way and stormed out. Now my mom is mad at me.
AITA?

TLDR: My sister‚Äôs babysitter does her job poorly and and when told so through excessively passionate means, she quit and now my mom is mad at me. AITA?

Additional info: My mom has been looking for other people for some time now, and was going to fire her when she did. She‚Äôs also not angry about the fact that the babysitter quit, but at the fact that I reacted so strongly. 

Additional info 2: I would also like to add that she is late basically everyday, I‚Äôve only listed the times when she was over 30 minutes late because she believes that there should be a ‚Äúcourtesy period‚Äù or something. 

Clarification: To like to further clarify, ‚Äúbabysitter‚Äù is an umbrella term, she is more of a personal assistant. She works for my sister, and gets her pay from my sister‚Äôs insurance company.

35,1ciui94,AITA for getting mad at my (25F) partner (30M) for not keeping the agreement we had on keeping our kitchen clean,"This is stupid I know but I'm at my wit's ends about it and I feel like no one is really hearing me out. 

My partner (30M) and I (25F) have been dating for almost 2 years and moved in together about a year ago. However, we have been having problems with the kitchen chores because we have different habits regarding cleaning. The main issue is that dishes with food residue are left in the sink overnight. (One time I went on a week-long trip and I came back and found food in the kitchen a mess. Plates and bowls covered in food just sitting in the sink. Pots and pans sitting on the stove with dried-up cooked food like it's been days old. Overall the kitchen was just nasty.) Although we have tried to come to a compromise, where he would do the dishes by putting them in the dishwasher and rinsing out the ones that won't fit and I would clean the counters and sweep since I hate doing the dishes. It hasn't been working out as well as we hoped. I have kindly asked him to rinse the dishes out or I do it myself, but it seems like we can't agree on a solution. He works a demanding job so I try not to ask much from him regarding other chores around the house. I try to make his evening as relaxed as possible. I know when he has a rough day at work I will do everything myself and I will let him relax and decompress cook him a hot meal or reheat leftovers and he will do the same vice versa. But other days it's different. Frankly, it's stupid to argue over the kitchen every single time so I just stay quiet and do the kitchen myself, but not every day do I do the kitchen because as a nurse I also have a demanding job I as well would leave dishes in the sink if they don't fit into the dishwasher but I rinse them and the sink so they don't attract bugs. I don't want to feel like I'm being a maid, so I need some advice on how my partner and I can keep the kitchen clean without leaving food in the sink. AITA?
Edit: I grew up in a structured home with 2 other siblings where the kitchen would be cleaned after every meal and my partner who grew up with 5 other siblings hasn‚Äôt. Even our parent put us on rotation with my siblings I have always HATED doing the dishes. But regardless of that I have taken his non structured environment into consideration. Hence the reason we sat and talked it out with the compromise in place. I just wanted to add this in to also help better understand the problem.

So my dad died back in the end of 2019. My mom and I moved from California to Arkansas almost a year ago. We‚Äôre about 6 hours from our closest family. My mom has really bad arthritis. Has constant teeth problems. And her knees are bad. So I help her a lot around the house. I‚Äôve never had a job or anything. Kinda been a bum since my dad died. Partly because of health problems. Although that‚Äôs my fault for not checking up with the doctor like I should. But over the last month or so I‚Äôve been working out and bettering myself, becoming more confident and really wanting to finally grow up and become my own man. I want to get in shape enough to get a good job. Maybe that‚Äôs just an excuse to prolong it, but that‚Äôs the plan I have. 

My mom has lots of problems and needs help with stuff, but we have horrible arguments every other day. Sometimes multiple days in a row. And yesterday when I told her I was going to work out like I always do before helping her, she told me I was a horrible person and selfish because she has arthritis and needs help with things at home. It made me feel so bad that I didn‚Äôt work out as much that day and cheated on my diet for the first time in weeks. That‚Äôs on me though. I shouldn‚Äôt have let it stop me. And then when I asked her what it was she needed help with, it was a short task of starting the lawnmower for a second. I only work out for 2 1/2 hours at a time‚Ä¶Then later that night she told me she was jealous of me being able to work out the way I do. We talked that night and made up. Or so I thought. 

The next morning she was giving me the silent treatment. I asked her if she wanted me to go to the dentist with her, and she ignored me. When she got home and I asked her what I did wrong, it started another argument. We eventually stopped and said we love each other. It was bad timing I admit but we had talked about me moving out multiple times before and she never got this angry. I started talking about how I may want to move out in the far future. She started getting angry and threw our remote at the ground. She started claiming I was abandoning her. I clarified that I didn‚Äôt know she would get so hurt because we had talked about it before and she didn‚Äôt act like this. I told her that it‚Äôs not a sure thing and that I wouldn‚Äôt move out if she was that hurt. Not to mention that if I did, it would be years from now, and I would still help her. She then went on to say I was trying to kill her with stress and threatened to take my name off our house that we co-own.  She then repeatedly said I‚Äôm disgusting and that I disgust her.

I‚Äôm personally very skeptical of marriage but I‚Äôm now the black sheep of the family by still being single. 

Last year they came to me with another potential match. We began chatting on WhatsApp and then began meeting up. It was nice, he seems like a good match and I was sick of the comments from older friends and family. I told my parents it was a good match and they began planning on the wedding. 

We were suppose to get married in 2 months but then a girl messages me and claims to be my fianc√©‚Äôs gf. I thought it was a scam but she knew everything about him and sent me photos of them together. She said they have been together for 6 years and they were supposed to be married.

I ask if they were still together and he says no but the girl sent a photo of them kissing at a festival that happened the previous weekend. So I don‚Äôt believe they are officially broken up and I think he plans to keep a side piece after we marry.

We have a mutual acquaintance, Angela, whom we went to school with. This friend lost a preemie baby five years ago, and usually posts about it once a year on the baby's birthday. Angela and I are not close, but I know that Mary also vents to her a lot and leans on her for support. 

Here is the issue: every year when Angela posts about the baby she lost, Mary rolls her eyes and says that she's being dramatic and shouldn't she be over it by now, which I think is a horrible thing to say, but I never thought it was my place to say anything to Angela, since I was closer to Mary. 

So my question is: WIBTA if I share with Angela what Mary said to me? I feel like Mary is taking advantage of Angela (as she did with me) while being a jerk behind her back, but I realize that I might be projecting and it probably isn't my place.

40,1citg8g,AITA for wanting to skip out of my cousin's destination wedding?,"Hi, so where do I begin? My cousin is getting married in Mexico in a few months. We have known about his wedding plans for a while now, so he has given multiple reminders and asked for advance payment. Well, here's where I am. Hesitating, my cousin failed to reach out at a time when I needed him the most last year. The doctors diagnosed my father with stage 4 brain cancer. Everyone, including him, knew of the diagnosis. However, during the last few months of my father's life, he has failed to reach out or visit him. He did not even send a simple text. However, his brother and a few other members didn't show up until it was almost too late. He was the only relative who didn't visit my father until the funeral. He was very well aware that my sister and I were upset that he was not reaching out when my father was in hospice. Heck, his own fiance sent a text message praying for his well-being. I didn't want to be the type of person to outwardly complain. However, I did ask a few relatives why he wasn't reaching out. They came back and told me he was just very busy and wanted to come visit, but always forgot. 


 We used to be very close as children, but of course, as we got older, we kind of distanced ourselves. However, whenever he would host family events, my sister and I will try to go. Generally, she visits more frequently than I do. We visit him and his fiance for their engagement party. It was two days after that party that we found our father in the hospital. So he was very aware that this was going on. It's been months now. We're still healing and processing our father's death. However, he and his fianc√© really want us to go to their destination wedding. They thought it'd be great for a vacation, and they just want us to maybe help us process our father's death and not think too much of it. At first, I was very forgiving. I had a small conversation with his brother and told him it was okay. 

I initially forgave him, but my sister was not so forgiving. However, I succeeded in persuading her to set aside past grievances, agree to attend the wedding, and maintain a united family front. But as the days passed, I started to really resent them. I never really asked for anything, and the one thing that should have been common sense was to visit a family member who's dying. He failed to do that. We didn't even have a fallout. There was no fight prior to this, so I didn't understand what the reasoning was. He has yet to give me one, so I decided I probably should not go to the wedding at all, and I just don't need to give him a reason, just like he failed to provide me with an explanation for his absence from my father.

41,1cit51q,AITA for not going to another restaurant after my boyfriend refused to order from where I stopped?,"Earlier today I asked my boyfriend to go with me to run some errands. When we finished I was hungry and picked a Mexican restaurant for lunch. It was more of an authentic place which I absolutely loved but my boyfriend said nothing looked appealing. He gave me money for my meal and said he was going to go to a place down the street. 10 minutes later he's back because the place had a really long wait
time.

I made some suggestions from the menu he would probably like to try but he said no. He said he told me last week he was burned out on Mexican food when we went out for dinner with my parents because 'we always eat it'. He didn't order anything that night either which was really embarrassing to have someone at the table not eating the entire time and trying to explain to my mother and step-dad in a way that didn't sound disrespectful. 

Service at this place was rather slow so I wound up taking most of my meal with me. He said to stop along the way to my place so he can get something to eat. I said no because he knew I had to be home by a certain time for a maintenance person and everything he wanted was in the opposite direction.

We got back to my place and he said he was going to go home because he was starving. I said he could stay and cook something here but he said no and that he needed space after I 'made him starve'. I told him he wouldn't be starving if he hadn't been picky and he left. He's still mad at me so AITA here?

ETA: No I am not Mexican but my stepdad is so I grew up eating it most my life. My stepdad picks where we choose to eat each week or he won't go, and they want all of us there each week or its a whole drama. I do cook other kinds of food sometimes. I do eat different food when I go to his home. When my boyfriend eats with me including our weekly meal with my parents it's only 3-4 days eating some kind of Mexican cuisine. I'll start asking him where he'd like to go when I drive.

The place he walked to was like 5 minutes away but he thought he wouldn't have time to wait for take-out since take-out was a 35 minute wait. Usually the sit down places I go to are pretty quick, like get your food 10-15 minutes after ordering. When we realized the place I chose was slow he didn't have time to go back or place an order online.

42,1cit4w1,AITA for going NC with my aunt?,"I‚Äôm 22 years old and autistic. Several months ago, I told my aunt about some bullying that he was experiencing at work. One of the managers called me a fool and a f**king idiot in front of the whole restaurant because i did something the assistant manager told me to do and she didn‚Äôt agree with it. I got very upset and stood up to her, and a few of my coworkers yelled at me and cussed me out. My coworkers had been treating me like shit for a while, and today was particularly bad. She told me she was sorry all that happened and knew it must‚Äôve been upsetting. She wouldn‚Äôt have liked it either. 

Later that day, on my lunch break, I called her and said they‚Äôre still mistreating me and that, after some thought, I told my boss everything that had happened. As a result, she put me on nearly opposite schedules and punished the manager by deducting her pay.  Then I said I wondered if the two were connected and she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty damn sure they are. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt tattle.‚Äù

I said that wasn‚Äôt tattling but she insisted it was, telling me I‚Äôm not gonna change the world and at the end of the day, your bosses don‚Äôt care that your coworkers are calling you names or whatever. All they care about is you doing your job and doing it well, they have enough things to worry about. Besides, it‚Äôs only natural for a bully to continue their behavior when they get into trouble. I asked her if she‚Äôd say that to a kid being bullied worse in school after telling a teacher. Her argument was that a child in school and an adult at work are two different things. Apparently, when you‚Äôre an adult and it‚Äôs your job, you have to weigh things out and ask yourself if this is really something the boss should know about or not. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been mistreated at jobs, but I was in a position where I couldn‚Äôt just leave, because I was single and divorced and had to support myself and my two kids. So I sucked it up and took it.‚Äù

I‚Äôve had a few grievances with her in the past, but this *really* took the cake. How I took that was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you get‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs your fault you got bullied.‚Äù I decided to go NC with her. This went on for a few months and then her husband called me. He gave the phone to her and immediately she confronted me about how she hadn‚Äôt heard from me in months. According to her, I can‚Äôt just cut people out of my life because they piss me off or I don‚Äôt agree with them, especially family. Apparently family is immune. If I do that, I‚Äôm gonna have a lonely life. I wasn‚Äôt being ‚Äúmature‚Äù. She said that she was mad at me and her feelings were hurt.  Additionally, her son almost died of a heart attack and spent weeks in the hospital and she used that against me by saying that I could‚Äôve been there for her during that time.

After we got off the phone, she sent me a text saying that if she ever said or did anything to hurt my feelings that she was sorry, that it‚Äôs never her intent. Me and how other people treat me are her foremost worry and she loses sleep and cries over me many nights. She‚Äôs always loved me like one of her own.

Side note : Sarah met friend Jody in ¬†September of the same year in a lunch that I organized so she only know her for couple of months.

Move forward to December ,when Sarah texted me and while that she sent me a message saying that she contacted Jody asking her about the problem between us and she told her a couple of stuff and Sarah started blaming me for hiding things from her . I got angry and didn‚Äôt respond to her .

44,1cisir7,AITA for not letting my wife drive my new car?,"During the initial stages of the COVID outbreak, my 1997 Camry's engine blew out unexpectedly, causing a major setback for my family as I usually drove my mother to work. We urgently needed a replacement vehicle, and fortunately, my mother secured a 2021 Honda lease. Initially, she intended to transfer ownership to me so that I could use the car freely (love you, mom).

A few months later, I met my now-wife, and we welcomed a baby boy into our lives. While my wife has her own car, she prefers using mine for reasons I don't entirely understand, but I'm fine with it. Despite her history of accidents and tendency to leave messes in the car, I allowed her to drive the Honda. However, I always felt a bit uneasy as a passenger due to her driving style.

As the lease neared its end, I explored options to trade it in for a Toyota but found that Honda doesn't allow other companies to buy out their leases. So, I opted to trade it for a newer Honda and decided to finance it this time. With my mother cosigning, I began making payments on my first car under my name. Given this, I've become extremely protective of the car, setting rules to keep it clean and limiting who can drive it to just myself.

My wife finds my attachment to the car odd and insists it's a family car, although I never declared it as such. I'm more than willing to chauffeur my family around, but I prefer driving due to concerns about my wife's driving history. This has led to some tension between us, with her feeling insulted that I don't trust her driving skills. Am I in the wrong here for being hesitant to let her drive my new car?

Update: I had a heart felt conversation and apologized for making her feel insulted and that wasn't my intention when I brought up her driving history/habits. I realized how materialistic I was and told my wife that she can have the freedom to drive the car. She can treat it however she wants but I would feel uncomfortable if she left the car in a mess and drove unsafely.

46,1cirnyu,WIBTA if I bring up my feelings about my son's girlfriend's mother?,"I (59f) met my son's (28m) girlfriend's (21f) mother (whom I believe is only 40) for the first time at the hospital when my granddaughter was born.

My son had been dating his girlfriend for only six months when she got pregnant, so they've been together for about fifteen or sixteen months in total. She moved in with him when she was only a few months along. She gave birth a few days ago. In the hospital, I met her mother for the first time. Previously, I didn't know much about her, only that my son's girlfriend was the second of five children, and that she and her older sister have a different father from the younger three.

The girlfriend's mother showed up to the hospital in pajama pants, a crop top, and some shoes that looked like slippers. It looked like she hadn't even bothered to shower or get ready. We were waiting in the hallway until my son and her daughter were ready for visitors. I tried to make conversation with her. I mentioned how much I've come to know and love her daughter and was glad to finally meet her. She said she really liked my son and was glad that her daughter had found someone with a good job who would be a good father to her grandchild.

My son is college-educated and has a well-paying job. However, the way she said it rubbed me the wrong way because it seemed like that was the only thing she cared about‚Äînot that my son is polite, kind, hardworking, and treats others with respect. I feel like if I were to judge her daughter just based on her job and/or education, she wouldn't be that impressive. But I'm not like that because I find her to be a very nice girl.

After some awkward small talk, with her mother mostly giving one-word answers and eyes glued to her phone, a nurse came out and mentioned that they were ready for visitors. The girlfriend's mother jumped up and rushed in, taking the only empty chair available when I have a bad hip and walk with a cane.

She held the baby first, and when it was my turn, she and the girlfriend were talking, acting as if I wasn't even there. Her mother was joking around, being a bit inappropriate and immature, and it felt unsettling. After about forty-five minutes, I left. I found out later that her mother stayed an additional hour before leaving to let the baby bond with my son and his girlfriend.

It's been a few days, and I'm still rubbed the wrong way. I just found the girlfriend's mother rude, immature, and maybe not the best influence. I really want to talk to my son about my feelings and just get a feel for how he truly feels about his girlfriend's mother. He is non-confrontational, will go with the flow, and not say anything or set any real boundaries if he's uncomfortable. He will open up if I ask him. I just want him to be careful and also want to be sensitive because I don't want to offend his girlfriend.

47,1cirfdn,"AITA for ""spoiling"" my daughter by taking her on holiday? ","Made this as a throwaway account for personal reasons.

I (M53) split up with my ex-wife (F49) about nine years ago. We have one 17-year-old daughter from the relationship, Tilly, who we share custody of. Due to work commitments, my ex has Tilly most of the weekdays, and I have the weekends. So my ex isn't stuck entirely with the ""boring"" schooldays, she also gets the weeks when Tilly is on vacation.

While my ex got remarried a few years ago, I never did. Although I dated here and there, a combination of work commitments and just not finding the right person meant it never clicked and I've stayed mostly single. I've worked my way up the career ladder as a result and I have a healthy amount of excess income, which I mostly put towards Tilly. I wouldn't say she's spoilt because I still try to give her a sense of responsibility around the house by helping with chores and don't hand out pocket money unless it's earned. However, since I have the means to do so, I do treat her with any clothes, makeup, gadgets, and the like. It's something I enjoy doing and she shows gratitude for it.

On the other hand, my ex is a stay at home mom and her new husband/Tilly's stepdad has a pretty standard job. I don't mean that disrespectfully but.the income generated in the household is average at best for a similar family type. As such, Tilly rarely gets any presents from her mom/stepdad other than on birthdays or any other holidays.

As Tilly's 18th birthday is coming up, I wanted to do something vey special for her, to also tie in with her leaving for college shortly. I arranged a trip to Europe for the two of us for two weeks over the summer. As co-parenting plans have to be arranged, I phoned my ex to say this would be my plan and to sort out all the logistics. To be surprise, my ex exploded at me. She said how I was ""spoiling"" Tilly and was only doing this to spite her because she knew that any gift she gave by comparison would be meaningless, making me the ""favourite parent"". I told her that wasn't true, and I just wanted to give my only daughter a present she'd love and memories to cherish.

Nonetheless, this went on, and my ex called me an asshole over the situation, saying that I need to scale down my present to not spoil Tilly and put us at a ""level playing field"". I laughed and said she was being ridiculous but to avoid any argument, I offered to say this was a ""joint present"" from us both if she/her husband were willing to contribute. This idea was shot down because Tilly ""wasn't stupid"" and knew it would be my present. I was done arguing at this point, so put down the phone.

48,1cirdlv,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's friend to stay with us?,"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) promised his friend (22M) he could stay with us for a week without asking me. 

For background, I met my boyfriend at a pizza shop where me, him, and his friend all worked together. I know this friend well, but he is definitely my boyfriend's friend, not mine. My boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years. I work full time and pay all of the bills. The house is mine that I inherited from a family member. My boyfriend started living with me over 2 years ago. He recently was out of work and now only works 2-3 days a week at a movie theater making not great money. 

His friend was living with his girlfriend and was not talking to my boyfriend often at all. Once the friend and his girlfriend started having problems and the girlfriend told him he needs to find somewhere else to stay, the friend started coming to my house every day to hang out with my boyfriend. The friend also has no job currently and he has both a mother and a brother in the city that he could stay with. My boyfriend asked me about a week ago if the friend could stay with us, and he knew I did not want it to happen. I said if he had no where else to go, he could stay a week tops. But this was a last resort as I am not comfortable with another person staying. I don't have room for him and I have four animals to care for and tend to. 

Last night, I got home from work and the friend was once again at my house. My boyfriend and I were already not on the best terms for other reasons.

However, like me, he has mental health issues. Like, REALLY bad mental health issues. I don‚Äôt blame him for that and i dont mind, but when he goes into a depressive episode or gets upset for no reason. 2 days ago, he gave me his phone to use at school so i can listen to music during class, since i dont have a phone, and the school blocked spotify for me since my mom told them to. Anyways, i tried to customize my discord server for roles and all that, and a bot sent me an automated message. I looked at it, and i noticed above some odd pictures from last year. They were depicting a bunch of girls that he used to talk to. He said that he completely forgot about them and that he regrets doing it. I said that it doesnt matter and that he‚Äôs really weird for doing this. The next day we began to hold hands and hug and all that before first hour started, but i began to think about him, and i went into this world of thought that he‚Äôs weird and that i dont want him anymore. While i was walking with him to his second hour class like i always do, i said ‚Äúi dont think this is gonna work‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwhat isnt?‚Äù And i said ‚Äúus‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs that‚Äù and i responded with ‚Äúi have my reasons.‚Äù He continued to walk towards the stairs, and i said ‚Äúbye‚Äù and walked past my second hour class. During band that day i said ‚Äúi only want to break up with you because some of the things you do make me uncomfortable‚Äù but he didnt hear me and said ‚Äúwhat? And i said ‚Äúnever fucking mind im just done with you.‚Äù When band eventually ended he stood up quickly from his chair, and tried to walk quickly to put his instrument away with a distressed look on his face, but i grabbed his hand and said ‚Äúi still love you.‚Äù 

Earlier today in band i told him that i wanted to move schools, without mentioning why which is because of some of the incredibly rude people in our school. I‚Äôve brought this desire up many times to him, and he usually gets upset because of it. Like usual, he said ‚Äúi understand‚Äù but seemed upset, and i said ‚Äúim not even gonna move schools even though i want to, you get upset for literally no reason and it‚Äôs fucking annoying.‚Äù he stopped looking at me and he began to stare off into space, facing the music stand. i turned away from him, and i didnt notice this at the time but he started to tear up.

My (14f) boyfriend (14m) have an overall great relationship, we see each other every day and give each other physical attention a lot, we also talk about our problems and other information like that. However, like me, he has mental health issues. Like, REALLY bad mental health issues. I don‚Äôt blame him for that and i dont mind, but when he goes into a depressive episode or gets upset for no reason. 2 days ago, he gave me his phone to use at school so i can listen to music during class, since i dont have a phone, and the school blocked spotify for me since my mom told them to. Anyways, i tried to customize my discord server for roles and all that, and a bot sent me an automated message. I looked at it, and i noticed above some odd pictures from last year. They were depicting a bunch of girls that he used to talk to. He said that he completely forgot about them and that he regrets doing it. I said that it doesnt matter and that he‚Äôs really weird for doing this. The next day we began to hold hands and hug and all that before first hour started, but i began to think about him, and i went into this world of thought that he‚Äôs weird and that i dont want him anymore. While i was walking with him to his second hour class like i always do, i said ‚Äúi dont think this is gonna work‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwhat isnt?‚Äù And i said ‚Äúus‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs that‚Äù and i responded with ‚Äúi have my reasons.‚Äù He continued to walk towards the stairs, and i said ‚Äúbye‚Äù and walked past my second hour class. During band that day i said ‚Äúi only want to break up with you because some of the things you do make me uncomfortable‚Äù but he didnt hear me and said ‚Äúwhat? And i said ‚Äúnever fucking mind im just done with you.‚Äù When band eventually ended he stood up quickly from his chair, and tried to walk quickly to put his instrument away with a distressed look on his face, but i grabbed his hand and said ‚Äúi still love you.‚Äù 

Earlier today in band i told him that i wanted to move schools, without mentioning why which is because of some of the incredibly rude people in our school. I‚Äôve brought this desire up many times to him, and he usually gets upset because of it. Like usual, he said ‚Äúi understand‚Äù but seemed upset, and i said ‚Äúim not even gonna move schools even though i want to, you get upset for literally no reason and it‚Äôs fucking annoying.‚Äù he stopped looking at me and he began to stare off into space, facing the music stand. i turned away from him, and i didnt notice this at the time but he started to tear up.

My nephews are getting bigger and they want seperate rooms. My brother asked me to help him finish his basement, make a couple of rooms down there, add a washroom, add a kitchenette, and wire up a family room. 

I priced it out and said I would charge him $32,000 including materials. This was a sizeable discount. The bathroom alone I would charge anyone else 15,000. His wasn't even roughed in. 

He never paid me. He always had excuses. I paid for the material and I paid my guys for the work. We did it when I had downtime so I didn't lose out on other money but it still sucked to get shafted. 

So I put a construction lien on the house. He didn't care and I wasn't going to make him homeless.

I came out as gay as a teenager, and my brother is married with a pregnant wife. Due to our religious trauma, we have deconstructed together many times and have both expressed that we are atheist. We agreed not to tell our parents this, because they are still very religious.
The problem started when my mom told me that my brother had begun to read the Bible again. I thought this was odd, so I called him to see what was up. He told me it was true, and that he didn't tell me because he was afraid of how I would react. I told him that I did not care and if he is doing something that helps him in any way then I am proud of him. I did say that I wanted to make sure he wouldn't return to our old homophobic beliefs, which was probably a dumb thing to say. He got offended and told me that given his track record, he's earned my understanding on this. He then said that I

He said ""Sorry, I didn't know it was a secret, it wasn't a secret for me."" I told him that wasn't true, and he knew I didn't want him to tell our parents. I said that he hurt me because I trusted him (my dad actually outed me to my mom after telling me not to come out to her, so stuff like that really bothers me.) He started yelling stuff like
""believe it or not my spiritual journey is not about you"" and ""you're an adult, talk to your parents."" I told him my point was that his spiritual journey wasn't about me, and I asked him to leave me out of it. I also told him that it wasn't fair to tell me what to tell anyone.

For context, I have issues with sound. I'm not sure why. I've always gotten really overwhelmed by large, loud noises. I'll feel like half of my brain has just shut down and then the other half is screaming so I'm really slow and not really rational when in noisy situations. I'm aware of the fact that I'll often get short and testy after spending some time in these situations and I'm trying to work on it, and I've gotten better as I've gotten older. I should've prepared for the ceremony better but I was stupid and just asked my parents to pick me up, not for details.

Because it was a large competition with tons of divisions, it took a couple of hours. Loud music was playing the whole time and all the talking and clapping meant that I was finding it really hard to not get angry at the people next to me. Every sound just sounded painful by the last hour, if that makes sense? IDK I feel really dramatic when I type it out but that's the best way I can explain it.

We had a couple minutes before reuniting with my brother (they had all the winners in a separate area). Before he came out, my parents asked why I seemed to upset and I told them that I was fine, I was just kind of overwhelmed because the noise was just a lot. They reminded me to seem happy which I was trying my best to do.

Then my parents took us all to dinner, which was really nice of them, except they talked all the way to the restaurant. My brother wasn't feeling too chatty (he said he was tired). When we got to the restaurant, he went to the bathroom to change, so there was about ten minutes alone with my parents. They asked why I seemed upset and I reminded them that I was saving my energy to be happy around my brother, but the noise was just expectedly a lot and I was still getting over it. I told them I just wanted it to be quiet for a bit (I would've gone to the bathroom at this point but there was only one in the restaurant).

My parents then kept questioning me, and here's where I think I'm at fault because after a bit I snapped at them and said, ""Could you stop talking?"" They seemed surprised and hurt at my outburst and I felt really badly and apologized. They continued to be sad and distant the rest of the meal. My brother came back from the bathroom not sure why we all seemed off. We just ate and sat in the silence I asked for.

I later overheard my parents complaining to my aunt about how I always ruin things with my weird noise issues.

I also discussed with the business and gave a disclaimer. I said I‚Äôd been drowning with everything as a new mom and that the house was cluttered and had never had a cleaning service help.

I also said that I wasn‚Äôt expecting any miracles at all, just any help would help.

At this stage, the house was ready for vacuuming, wiping windows, etc. 

I got a message complaining about the house. Basically ‚ÄòNext time you need to move things out of the way. We had to move things to clean and rearranged a couple things.‚Äô

60,1ciogpz,AITA for not accommodating my house guest?," I (42F) rent a 1500 sq ft house which has one bedroom and bathroom in the main area, and a converted garage with an additional bathroom. The garage is now a guest space. When my friend (46F) visits, I let her use the main bathroom, which is technically closer to my bedroom, while I use the one near the garage. They are about 20 steps apart.

Despite multiple explanations, she seems upset about using the bathroom closer to my bedroom. She frequently leaves personal items in my own bathroom and gets irritated when I move them to avoid getting them wet.

She‚Äôs begun criticizing the temperature settings in my home. During her last visit, despite it being a snowstorm outside, she complained it was too hot inside at 73¬∞F. My house, being quite old and drafty, tends to cool down quickly, as confirmed by a room thermometer. The thermostat setting is actually a bit misleading due to these drafts.

I‚Äôve asked other guests about both the bathroom arrangement and the temperature, and none have expressed the concerns she has.

62,1cioaau,AITA for telling my dad and his wife I don't know what her daughter is into?,"My dad got married 3 years ago to Josie. My sisters (15f and 13f) and I live with full time because our mom died. I (17m) kind of stepped up because dad was never the most involved parent and after mom died he still wasn't great with parenting stuff. He got married again 4 years after mom died. Josie and her daughter (15f) moved in with us.

So Josie is basically the same as dad. Not that involved. Actually, she seems less involved than my dad. But what I didn't know is she expected me to take on her daughter as a sister and be there for her like I am my sisters which didn't happen. I don't hate her but I see Josie's daughter as someone I'm in a forced roommate situation with. Not family. I see Josie the same way.

I don't do stuff for Josie's daughter like I do my sisters. Sometimes I'll buy them something I know they'll like as a treat. Normally one at a time since I'm only working weekends.

My dad and Josie never checked on her daughter or that we'd all gotten close. Then Josie got a call from the school that her daughter was being bullied and going through a rough time. Josie decided to spoil her daughter and asked me what stuff her daughter liked/was into. I didn't know and I told her. She called dad in and she asked me again and I said I didn't know, I don't spend time with her daughter.

They brought up the stuff I do for my sisters and I said yeah, I do them for my sisters, not the random girl who lives with us. I said I don't do stuff for either of them, meaning dad or Josie, either. Josie freaked out and said I was supposed to treat them all the same and she asked me why I hadn't taken her daughter on as my sister. I said because I already had two and didn't need to worry about anyone else. I said they were the adults and they didn't make a family, they just thought they could get me to basically adopt Josie's daughter.

Josie called me names, dad was like why wouldn't you embrace the girl, we really thought you'd do everything to make sure she felt wanted. I told them it wasn't my job.

Josie still doesn't know what her daughter likes and I'm getting glared at every day now.

64,1cio30o,AITA for not believing in my friend's animal telepathy business while being a tarot reader ?,"First time posting and English is not my main language, so my apologies for any mistake.

My (25M) friend from high school (25F) decided one year ago to quit her job and become an animal caregiver and a natural treatments vendor in a pyramidal scheme.

Her kind of ""therapy"" with animals is telepathic. It's called Animal Communication, also found it being called ""Telepathic silent language"" on the internet. She basically sit near a pet, dog, cat, horse... and says she receives messages from them by thelepathy, that she communicates to the owner. She says she can do it with just a photo and the name of the animal, even if it is far away.

Now about 3 months ago, she entered a pyramidal scheme type of business to sell different ""natural medicines"" such as essential oils, jewels, dreamcatchers... you name it.

She seems very on board and sincere in all of this. She really talks about it with passion, and explains a lot what she feels. She says that she can feel the energy flowing around and from people/animals and interacts with it with her items and her own energy. She calls it her ""own science"".

Why is that a problem to me ?

1. I'm not a believer in all this at all, especally since she made it a business. Would it be anybody else than her, i would believe she would be a scammer.
2. Once, she told me i had dark energy emissions, because my own family is supposed to be mediums as per my grandpa's say (i don't fully believe it), read tarot and stuff. But none of us take it seriously and none of us has made a business out of it. I would always say to friend i give readings that there is a huge part of interpretation and approximation that makes it easy to connect it to anybody's history and character. I only do it in good fun because i was taught how to do it and it's nice to share these moments with others. I also have some really nicely decorated games and love to show it to visiting friends and explaining the history of tarot. For the medium part, my grandfather and uncle said they felt when somebody is close to death's door, but i kinda believe it's more of a coping mechanism.
3. She is really bothered that me and our other friends are not on board with this. Like, not paying her to see our pets, not organizing some sales in our homes for her products...

Recently, she said we are not respecting her and her beliefs. A friend and i told her that we do not believe in what she does and it made her rather furious. She said we respect religions but would not respect her beliefs, making us AH and biggots. She was especially targeting me, for the tarot and medium thing (which i do not fully believe and do not sell once again) and said i was controlling what she is supposed to feel and how she is supposed to live.

Some friends told me that she was right to target me because of the tarot thing. I just do it for fun and collections because i find them pretty and the symbolism really hits me.

I see this job as self improvement and opportunity‚Äôs to learn from, I like the atmosphere and the colleagues are nice. I meet inspiring people everyday.  I respect my boss and I also learn a lot from him. I wanna leave on good terms ofcourse. so theres not much I can do about it.

my boyfriend on the other hand is pissed, he says that im choosing my minimum wage job over our dreams of moving abroad and that he wouldn‚Äôt wait and leave alone. 
I said that he‚Äôs letting me down and that it‚Äôs fine if he wants to leave but that I don‚Äôt wanna see or hear from him again. I think thats very fair because why would I want to wait until he leaves, rather immediately so I can ‚Äúgrieve‚Äù now rather in summer and unknown of what we‚Äôre doing. now he‚Äôs saying that all he wants is just for us to be happy and together and 
that he doesn‚Äôt want to lose me and just go with him. 

I want to, but I can‚Äôt really let them down. I understand that its also wrong of me to make plans before summer as that isnt what I told in the interview but cant he just wait 2 more months?

I see this job as self improvement and opportunity‚Äôs to learn from, I like the atmosphere and the colleagues are nice. I meet inspiring people everyday.  I respect my boss and I also learn a lot from him. I wanna leave on good terms ofcourse. so theres not much I can do about it.

my boyfriend on the other hand is pissed, he says that im choosing my minimum wage job over our dreams of moving abroad and that he wouldn‚Äôt wait and leave alone. 
I said that he‚Äôs letting me down and that it‚Äôs fine if he wants to leave but that I don‚Äôt wanna see or hear from him again. I think thats very fair because why would I want to wait until he leaves, rather immediately so I can ‚Äúgrieve‚Äù now rather in summer and unknown of what we‚Äôre doing. now he‚Äôs saying that all he wants is just for us to be happy and together and 
that he doesn‚Äôt want to lose me and just go with him. 

I want to, but I can‚Äôt really let them down. I understand that its also wrong of me to make plans before summer as that isnt what I told in the interview but cant he just wait 2 more months?

66,1cinvar,AITA for uninviting my friend's boyfriend to my birthday dinner?,"My birthday is tomorrow and I am having dinner with close friends. One of my best friends, let's call her Annie, has a boyfriend of 5 months, Derek. Annie and Derek have had a rocky relationship so far. There are few big areas of life that they are not seeming compatible in. They have almost broken up several times, the¬†most recent being last week. Derek is not a bad or evil person, however he is quite immature, emotionally unavailable, and having some mental health issues that he is not willing to get support for (Annie's words). One of the worst issues that popped up for them was that he chose to do nothing for her 30th birthday in March, which he knew was very important to her. It is very hard for me to like Derek after all of the incidents that have occurred.¬†

Now for my birthday dinner: I never invited Derek*.* We are not friends and have only hung out maybe 5 times. I was never going to invite him to my dinner as I only want close friends there. Annie misunderstood this because at one point I mentioned considering inviting a different friend's boyfriend but I haven't met him yet and decided it wasn't the right occasion and I wanted close friends there. Two other friends that attending are married and their husbands are coming too; I am friends with their husbands. I told Annie that Derek could come only because she had already told him he was invited.¬†

Last year I was going through an extremely rough mental health period. On my actual birthday all I did was cry hysterically and the birthday celebration I had with friends was not fun to uncomfortable for various reasons. This year I am in a completely better and healthier place. Birthdays are super important to me and I wrestled with uninviting (can it be that if I never did?) Derek as I knew Annie would be upset. Ultimately, I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of him going.

I told Annie that I was rescinding my ""invite"". I said I understood if she was upset and if she needed space, but that I truly only wanted people I was close with at my dinner. Annie did not take this well. She said I am extreme, that I can't be a supportive friend, and that she felt like she couldn't talk to me without me taking things out on her. She said me saying that at this moment in time his behavior has made me dislike him, was unacceptable and she supports her friends no matter what. Nothing I said about Derek to her was any different than the past few months or even two days before. She also let me know she will not be going now. Since last Friday, she has not responded to my last message and has also been sub-tweeting¬†me.¬†

**TL;DR** I uninvited my friend's boyfriend who she is constantly almost breaking up with from my birthday dinner. I technically never invited him, I only agreed he could go after she told him he was invited. Since last Friday she hasn't spoken to me and is being petty on twitter.

67,1cinuiy,AITA for spreading my wife's ashes without inviting her sister?,"My wife passed away in June of last year. It's been a difficult transition for me but I'm holding it together and adjusting to my new life. My wife specified in her will that I and a couple who were with us when we were married in Hawaii 30 years ago return to Hawaii to spread her ashes at Wai ªƒÅnapanapa State Park on Maui. Our trip is planned for October, where I will spread her ashes on our anniversary at the place we agreed is the most beautiful place we have ever seen. 

My wife had two sisters, one of whom I'll call Lara. Before passing, my wife warned me that Lara was going to have a very hard time dealing with her passing, and she was right. Lara is  still very emotional about her sister's passing and has said several times that she wants to go when I make the trip to spread the ashes. I always remained non-committal on that.

The thing is, I want to stick with what my wife specified in her will, which is me and our two close friends taking the trip together. While this trip has a purpose, it's also a vacation for me. I and my two friends are making it a blowout vacation, with first class plane tickets and beachfront rooms in nice hotels, something I've never done before, but that's how my wife would have wanted us to do it. Lara is on very limited retirement income and could not afford to join us if invited. I guess I could pay for it but I don't want to vacation with her. She's a sweet and thoughtful person but disaster seems to follow her everywhere. I like her. I just don't want to vacation with her.

Today Lara asked me if I've made my plans to spread the ashes and I told her I have. I know she's hurt I'm not inviting her. I could see it in her eyes. After all, this is her sister, and I understand how she feels and how this would her with closure. I've thought about giving her some of the ashes she could spread somewhere herself, but I don't like the idea of splitting them up.

I am planning my guest list in advance to work out pricing for the dinner reservation, and it included two important characters. DJ and Redhair (fake names)

DJ and Redhair are my friends, and I only just met Redhair while I knew DJ for about nine months. they both were close friends, and honestly inseparable. If DJ was there, Redhair was there too. Redhair had a Bf who im gonna call Bf, and DJ had a girlfriend. 

Bf and Red dated for a couple months, but ended up breaking up due to ‚Äúneeding time‚Äù (yeah right). It turns out Red said Bf was way too sexual and she wasnt ready. She called me to complain about it and it hit harder when she said Bf tried forcing her hand down his pants. This new hit close to home due to a similar thing happening to me as a pre-teen.

Red explained she wanted to try dating him again when they‚Äôre both ready.

 But secretly, Bf kept flirting with Red because he ‚Äúmissed her‚Äù. They obviously still liked eachother. She‚Äôd talk about Bf while giggling and blushing. 

around a month later, DJ got broken up with by her girlfriend. Bf found out and went for DJ immediately(RED‚ÄôS BEST FRIEND) and they began dating THE DAY AFTER DJ BROKE UP WITH HER GIRLFRIEND. Red told everyone about the SA, but screenshots got out that revealed it was one big lie to play the victim. Red found out about them dating and slapped Bf in the courtyard, and a week later they both apologized to eachother. Red and DJ both hate eachother now. I talk to DJ a lot less

70,1cimzo1,AITA for talking to my boss this way,"
Okay so I started working at this company a little over 6 months ago and we do construction. It is usually (25)me, tim,(19) and John(58) We ride to the job in a single cab truck and I ride middle. John sits to the left and smokes his cigarette the entire ride and ash blows everywhere. Me and tim have talked to John about it multiple times and it gets better for a day then he does it again. Me and tim finally report this to our main supervisor. While we were reporting this I also reported how John has been throwing trash and bags out of the window every day riding between jobs. And also left the job for 2 hours one day to go to the grocery store up the road to use the restroom and still got paid for it.  The supervisor says we need to just stop complaining. John has been there 4 years and frequently takes the easy task at work. 
So last week on the way home from the job when arrived at the shop the supervisor was in his truck pulling out to leave and I had clocked out at this point, starts to ask me what is wrong, I was clearly and visibly upset but wasn't saying anything. After he asked about 2-3 times I finally say ""I do not have anything to say to you right now"" and get in my car and proceed home. 

The supervisor then goes to pull behind my car in the employee lot, blocks me in almost completely, and tried to call my phone 5 times in the span of 15 minutes. I sent him a text message that said ""I do not want to talk about work on non work hours"" and left it at that 

The next morning the supervisor brings me, tim, and John into his office and says ""so you (me) have a problem with John and don't like him, correct?"" I replied, "" it's not about liking him, he is doing things that are wrong and illegal"" something like that. John instantly denies throwing any trash ""not that I recall, only cigarette butts"" (as if that isn't littering also) and tim confirms that he did see john throw things out as well. 

That goes on for about 5 minutes and then the supervisor looks at me and says ""why did you not answer when I was calling you yesterday?"" And I replied, ""I'm not going to talk to you about work while I'm off the clock"" and he replies ""you will talk to me about work whenever I want you to"" and we go back and forth and I finally said ""okay next time you wanna talk after I leave work I'll start a timer on my phone and send it to the payroll lady"" and "" I feel like your goal in this conversation is to fire me so just go ahead and do it now"" and then he told me to leave and I walked out. Didn't say anything else. 
I called him and apologized later that day for what I said. 
 I go to get my last check, return my time card, and material. After I returned it the supervisor text me ""hey, no hard feelings, I'll consider letting you return to work in the next few days."" 

I text him 3 days after and said ""hey, was just wondering if you were going to let me return to work or do I need to begin looking for another job"" and he didn't reply.

78,1cilw5s,AITA for not working for my grandmother for free?,"
Hello, this has been bothering me for quite some time and I need advice. Me and my grandma came to an agreement that if I were to help her shower and clean her house, she'd pay me. She was the one who offered this deal to me. I earn $70 dollars for showering her ‚Äî And cover for when her nurse cannot be there. Her nurse is paid the same amount and she does not mind paying me the same. For cleaning her 4 bedroom 3 bathroom home, I get $50 every other two weeks. I don't go up just to make money, but I am there to cook her meals and spend time with her EVERY day. I have a trip coming up, and as she said, ""You scratch my back, I scratch yours.""

Cut to a few days ago, I learn that my cousin has been lying behind my back and said I stole over one thousand dollars from her this month alone. Over the course of three months, I have earned that amount. But not stolen.

Now, my aunt is texting me and saying I've started a whole shitshow because I told my parents about it and, according to her: misinterpreted what my cousin said. So her and my dad are arguing. Which, by the way, meant my cousin was going through my grandmas checkbook for some reason. She told my dad that her ""boy"" (he's in his 30s. I am 19.) would never lie and to not believe everything I say.

My aunt's main concern is that I did not text her about it. And she has been referring to my grandmothers money as ""her"" money and that she cannot afford to pay for me helping and expects me to do it for free. 

AITA?

Edit: Thank you guys SO much for the advice. My aunt has a medical power of attorney over her, nothing more. There is quite alot going on, as my cousin HAS stolen from her before!! A few years ago he was caught with my grandmothers credit card and when I told my aunt, my cousin bitched me out aggressively and accused me of stealing. It was brushed off that he had it to buy her groceries. We went to a lawyer and tried to get my aunt, my uncle and father to get a Conservatorship to ensure no more thievery, but they could not come to an agreement.

81,1ciln1j,AITA: When i am upset I shut down and can only speak very quietly if at all. My partner is hard of hearing. Am I being ableist?,"When I (NB19) get upset I cannot control my volume, which results in me speaking very quietly one second before getting panicked and SCREAMING because i'm trying to get the words out . I used to not be able to speak at all in any disagreement especially if voices are raised as it made me shut down, the most I could do was shake or nod my head. This is due to past trauma where i've been punished for speaking in disagreements.

My partner (NB19) is hard of hearing, which makes it difficult for us to communicate sometimes. Most of the time I am able to control my tone when speaking loudly (speaking loud enough for them to hear requires a lot of strain on my voice as I am a small individual, i've gotten better at controlling my tone when speaking loudly but it's still not perfect and I used to always sound angry before I learned how to control it). This is especially an issue during arguments as them speaking their normal speaking volume sounds extremely loud to me as if they're yelling at me (only in disagreements, I think it is due to me becoming more sensitive to stimuli when upset) which triggers me and usually makes me shut down and speak in a whisper. Like I said earlier, this then develops into me actually raising my voice really loudly but this is not something i'm doing voluntarily- I am just panicked because me speaking quietly frustrates my partner and makes them more upset.

When I say I can't speak louder even though I've explained this to my partner they've said that i'm being ableist by not accommodating their disability. I understand where they're coming from, it's very frustrating when you can't hear someone and they're refusing to speak up. But in my case it's that i'm genuinely unable to control my volume, at least consciously. The raising my voice afterwards doesn't exactly help my case as it makes them think I'm lying and could raise my voice the whole time and just didn't want to. 

Is this actually ableist of me or is this a genuine misunderstanding? Could I possibly control my volume when upset but be refusing to through some sort of mental block??

Edit for relevant information:

I have been diagnosed with cPTSD and anxiety and I do struggle with confrontation and ""perceived rejection"" (not sure how to say this, those with ADHD have likely heard of RSD or rejection sensitive dysphoria, basically makes me react very strongly to any perceived social rejection like criticism, like ""why can't you ___""), my partner knows this. I do strongly suspect that I'm neurodivergent in some way but i'm not seeking a diagnosis as i cannot afford it and getting one would likely lead to me being discriminated against in my field of study. 

I appreciate all the replies, even the ones calling me the asshole; it's given me insight on what I can do here and what I should be aware of.

I am in active therapy and I'm working on trusting that people are not rejecting me or attacking me, that i don't need to guess anyone's mood in order to be safe (except my mother's, who i am still unfortunately in contact with out of necessity. I am 19 and an international student which limits my working hours to 20hrs/ week during the year so I am still dependent on her for financial support).

I have tried alternative forms of communication like texting or writing on paper instead, it is a bit difficult to navigate as texting during arguments doesn't work for my partner and non-verbal signals (so if i were for example to make a ""time out"" signal with my hands indicating i need to go calm down, they would not pick up on it) don't either. The solution I have right now is just to try to make sure i don't get distressed enough to get to that point.

All the best to you all!!",Asshole,2024-05-02,"AITA: When i am upset I shut down and can only speak very quietly if at all. My partner is hard of hearing. Am I being ableist? When I (NB19) get upset I cannot control my volume, which results in me speaking very quietly one second before getting panicked and SCREAMING because i'm trying to get the words out . I used to not be able to speak at all in any disagreement especially if voices are raised as it made me shut down, the most I could do was shake or nod my head. This is due to past trauma where i've been punished for speaking in disagreements.

My partner (NB19) is hard of hearing, which makes it difficult for us to communicate sometimes. Most of the time I am able to control my tone when speaking loudly (speaking loud enough for them to hear requires a lot of strain on my voice as I am a small individual, i've gotten better at controlling my tone when speaking loudly but it's still not perfect and I used to always sound angry before I learned how to control it). This is especially an issue during arguments as them speaking their normal speaking volume sounds extremely loud to me as if they're yelling at me (only in disagreements, I think it is due to me becoming more sensitive to stimuli when upset) which triggers me and usually makes me shut down and speak in a whisper. Like I said earlier, this then develops into me actually raising my voice really loudly but this is not something i'm doing voluntarily- I am just panicked because me speaking quietly frustrates my partner and makes them more upset.

When I say I can't speak louder even though I've explained this to my partner they've said that i'm being ableist by not accommodating their disability. I understand where they're coming from, it's very frustrating when you can't hear someone and they're refusing to speak up. But in my case it's that i'm genuinely unable to control my volume, at least consciously. The raising my voice afterwards doesn't exactly help my case as it makes them think I'm lying and could raise my voice the whole time and just didn't want to. 

Is this actually ableist of me or is this a genuine misunderstanding? Could I possibly control my volume when upset but be refusing to through some sort of mental block??

I brought it up to him and his reasoning was it's because they share a room...I obviously do not agree with this.

I WFH twice a week, and do most of the chores as I only think is fair. I did, however, ask my partner to please help out during the weekend and to keep clean and clean after herself during the week. 

I told her I‚Äôm comfortable with splitting things 60-40 and I don‚Äôt expect her to do anything during the week, but at least one morning during the weekend I would like for her to do something.

She won‚Äôt wash and rinse the sink, as this is my job as well. When she cooks she won‚Äôt clean the hob either, so I then have to clean the mess she left behind as well. 

I‚Äôve asked her many times in many different ways to please help me out more. Her response is always that I‚Äôm obsessing over the wrong things, that I need to stop stressing her out with this, and that I need to stop nagging. 

Every time I ask, no matter how nicely I do it, to please remember to take out the rubbish or throw away the 10 empty glass bottles that she has accumulating on the floor because she cannot be bothered to throw them away, she starts yelling at me and tells me to stop, and why do I always starts?

This made S mad and he kept bickering under his breath. C and L both spoke up and politely asked 4 times for S to drop it so we could enjoy dinner. At this point R was silent. S starts attacking R‚Äôs character spewing things out of anger.

N‚Äôs brother S asked if she could move her chair from the shaded area under the umberella into the sun so his wife could sit next to him. My wife politely noted that we paid for the chairs and umberella and she‚Äôs not gonna sit in the sun when we paid for shade and comfort which to me was understandable. My wife stated that the rental was $40 and he could get one. Once N said that, S flew off the handle stating how he‚Äôs not in the mood and to drop it because he doesn‚Äôt want to hear us anymore. We digressed. 

Fast forward to dinner. We all get to dinner and things are going good. We‚Äôre all talking about what we are doing Friday because it‚Äôs couples day. S bought playoff basketball tickets and was asking R if he could take them down there. (We only have one vehicle). R stated that the game is an hour+ from where they are going and S should look into a Lyft/Uber. S starts trying to poke at R to get under his skin because S didn‚Äôt get what he wanted. R attempted to diffuse it since we were out to dinner and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just drop it and you can look into it later and we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù. This made S mad and he kept bickering under his breath. C and L both spoke up and politely asked 4 times for S to drop it so we could enjoy dinner. At this point R was silent. S starts attacking R‚Äôs character spewing things out of anger. I looked at S and said, ‚ÄúYou need to drop it because we‚Äôre all trying to enjoy our vacation, but instead we have to listen to you guys constantly bickering back and forth over trivial stuff. I‚Äôm sick of it. You guys are each others worst enemy and lack the ability of letting something go. This is a toxic family dynamic and I don‚Äôt understand how this is ‚Äònormal‚Äô to you guys.‚Äù I will admit I was yelling and should‚Äôve handled it better. C stormed off in tears, L followed her to console her. S looked at me and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to referee my family, this is how we‚Äôve always been‚Äù S stormed off at that point. L asked if I was willing to apologize. I said yes even though I was still heated because I didn‚Äôt want this to affect our entire trip. So we walked down to where S and C are, I gave them both a hug and apologized for my actions and raising my voice to them. I also stated that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy to constantly bicker and fight because it‚Äôs really toxic behavior. Especially towards family. After apologizing there was an awkward silence and he told N that my apology was backhanded. ",1.0,1.0181020498275757,1,1

I met this man almost 18 months ago, and I instantly connected with him. He was charming, smart, and funny. I introduced him to my husband and son, and he became close to our family. It was one of the most beautiful friendships I have ever had, and I became emotionally invested in this relationship. He had borrowed some money from me in small amounts over the course of one year, citing various reasons. It didn't really bother me until I asked him once about the possibility of returning the money, and he had an excuse. I then made a sarcastic comment about him not returning the money once, and this offended him. He immediately wanted to break all ties with me and end the friendship. I realized my mistake and apologized. But this fell into deaf ears. No matter how much I tried to approach him and tell him not to worry about returning the money, he wasn't ready to listen and blocked me out on WhatsApp and Instagram.

The petition accused a tenant that I do not even know of taking drugs and listening to loud music all day, claiming the drug use is so bad that other tenants get a headache from it. He wanted me to sign it.

I read through it and only the barber and another female tenant signed it. Personally, I live right under the roof so I have never noticed a lot from other tenants. When thinking back, there is a flat that sometimes has pot smell coming outside of it, but it is not a regular thing (at least from what i smell) and I do not even know whether that is the tenant they mean.  But aside from that, I never, EVER have heard loud music when moving through the stairwell, not even one single time. So really, that is not enough to just be supportive of the petition in my book.

I told the barber that i do not feel comfortable signing an accusatory letter without ever having noticed anything myself. He instantly went from friendly to really upset, saying ""well, I do not force you, but when something happens, I will tell everybody you did not sign it"". I do not know what he means by that, I can only imagine he thinks the other tenant is dangerous or might start a fire when on drugs. He accused me of not caring about the other people living there, including the woman who signed. I got upset myself and went on my way.

Any thoughts there? Should I have inquired further instead of just denying it outright?

99,1cij9km,AITA for not wanting to go to g/fs ex's funeral?,"My partner of nearly 11 years recently found out her ex died a week ago of pancreatitis (he drank a lot). She wasn't in contact with him but she did follow him on socials. His brother apparently had her number and let her know. He even sent her the photo of his corpse (apparently he took the photo when he found his brother and she wanted to see it?). 

Now his sister invited her to the funeral. When I got home from work last night, she was apprehensive. I knew something was up, and she eventually told me that she was invited. She asked me if she could go, and I told her I'm not going to stop her and she's a grown woman and can do what she feels like doing and I will be here for her when she gets back, but I don't want to go with her. 

Her ex may have been special in her life at one point  (she said he treated her ok but he had a terrible drinking problem and that is why she left him), but he is nothing to me and I would feel very uncomfortable being there. I have mixed feelings on the whole matter but I'm not her keeper and won't try to control her. She seems fine to go on her own, but AITA for not wanting to go with her?

100,1cij1dn,AITA for mocking my friend about her toxic ex?,"So I (28M) have been friends with Trent and Amy. Me and Trent are both aro/ace. Well Trent is actually probably somewhere on the spectrum but I don't really know anymore. He came out a 16, me 17. It was around this time that our friends started going off in relationships and I felt lonely. I noticed that everywhere, no matter where romantic relationships always seemed to take precedence over everything else. And I get that I really do, its like a staple of romantic relationships that they come first. I talked about this with Trent, and we decided the best way to get past this (cause he was feeling the same way) was to basically get like a kinda pact between the 2 of us. That we were gonna come first for each other, kinda like boyfriends but without the romance.

This worked pretty well. We were even considering getting married just to solidify it. Meanwhile, Amy had a new boy/girl every month. She‚Äôs had this recent obsession, Ryan. I don't want to pass judgement on Ryan because. obviously, I don't know him. But from what I can tell he's an embarrassment to humanity. He can't hold down a job, is drunk 90% of the time to the point where he doesn't come out of his apartment. His apartment- by the way- is paid for by me. Cause Amy comes crying to me asking for money for him.

Now, back to me and Trent. So Trent now has a boyfriend. Like a real one. And I'm reeling. I don't know how or when this happened. Maybe I've been to busy with work or looking after my grandma to notice but somewhere along the line he got a boyfriend, without telling me. Edit: I have obscured said boyfriend's name for privacy. Lets call him Trevor.

So I went crying to Amy cause, you know, my world just got annihilated and I feel like I'm dying. Also Trent and I live together so I didn't want to go to my house. Amy then proceeded to act very confused and then ask me why I'm crying so much cause it's not like Trent and I were actually boyfriends. She then told me that I should be happy for Trent who finally has a 'real' relationship.

I snapped and here's the part where I may have been the AH. I told her she has no leg to stand on when it comes to 'real' relationship cause she kept running back to Ryan on her knees, at least I could hold down a relationship for near a decade 'real' or not. Which, admittedly, cruel. And I stormed out. I know toxic relationships can be hard to get out of and since I've been her shoulder to cry on since we were teens I know full well just how much pain this douche has caused her. I feel bad about throwing it back in her face but at the same time I'm still hurting. A lot.

101,1ciih26,AITA for accepting to be the best man in my best friend's wedding after he didn't invite my new girlfriend?,"Let's go color code. Best friend will be Blue, his bride will be Yellow. My GF will be Pink. We are all adults pushing the 30s. 

It all started a few days ago when Blue came to my house with Yellow and gave me the invitation to his wedding and bottle of wine with a little note saying ""You were with us since the very beginning. Would you be our bestman?"" 

I was very happy. I was honored. Blue and I are best friends for 15 years. We barely see each other or even talk nowadays but we never lost that connection. We had a promise that we would be each other's bestmen since before we were legally able to marry. So, I accepted without a thought. 

Then he said something like ""We just need to see who you gonna pair up"" to each Yellow said ""I think it will be <Random Girl I Never Heard About>"". Then Blue starts talking about how they are struggling with invitation, cuz they both have big families and they are already over the capacity of the venue. A lot of long time friends are not getting invited at all. 

All is great. We part ways and then I take a better look at the invitation. Nothing about a plus one. I sent a msg asking about my girlfriend, Pink, and he says he is sorry but they are over the venue capacity already. But if someone refuses the invitation she can go. 

I tell the news to my girlfriend and, man... She was devastated. We are together for 5 months. But we already talk about moving together, marrying, having kids. We are pushing 30s we don't want to fool around, both of us are looking someone to settle down. So when she heard that she was not invited and that I would be paired up with another woman, she felt humiliated. She felt unwelcome. I said I didn't like it either, but it was not my wedding and that I would never refuse to be his bestman. She then says that he is more important to me than her and we get in a big argument. I get why she is hurt but is not my wedding, I won't fight with my friend who I'm sure is stressed enough as is. She said if he was my best friend I could make him let me if I said I would only be his bestman if he let her come. And I'm like, so I have to blackmail him? 

Also a point she brought up was how he is supposed to be my bestman if we marry in the future but she can't stand the thought of having him as bestman when she wasn't even invited. 

But here is the thing. They don't know her. They know OF her. But Blue and Yellow never met Pink. So it is kinda expected that she would not be invited over friends and family. And unreasonable that she would be a bridesmaid (she wants pair up to me) to someone she never saw. 

The argument died down but she is still very much not over. She feels like I didn't fight for her and I don't care about her. Her family all agree with her. I didn't ask my family or any of my friends because I don't want to make this even bigger.

It's all kinds of awful and pathetic on my brothers part. It started when my nephew was doing his homework one day and one of his sheets he had to answer questions. For a question about his parents he said he has 2 and his mom is dead so he has one left.

My nephew's mom died when he was 5 and my brother remarried 2 years ago. Stepmom took over the primary caregiver role but sometimes my brother is home to ""help"". This was one of those days. My brother and SIL saw what my nephew had wrote and my brother tried to correct him. My nephew refused to change his answer and ever since it's been a fight.

I tried telling my brother he shouldn't fight his kid over something like that. He should just let the relationship be whatever and try to not make it such a power struggle. He told me his wife deserves more respect and recognition than that. SIL was so hurt that an 8 year old didn't mention her in his homework. She apparently thought he loved her like a mom and she was let down he didn't even like her enough to add her to the homework. I heard this and suggested to my brother that maybe they needed to sit down and talk calmly (him and his son). But I was told that wasn't possible where this problem is concerned. 

It's been a year of this battle between father and son and to me it's annoying. Mother's Day last year was crazy. My brother bought a card that said mom on it and my nephew tore it up. SIL was upset again that he didn't want to give her a card with mom on it and it pissed my brother off. They couldn't shut up about it when they showed up at the restaurant for the Mother's Day dinner our family has. I know this year will be equally crazy.

At the weekend my brother was complaining about the fighting and saying his son tells others more stuff than he tells him. He was also saying people were judging him. I said of course they do, that he's the adult fighting with his son for over a year, whose still a young kid, all because he didn't want to write that SIL is his mom and parent.

My brother accused me of mocking him. I was incredulous and maybe a little sarcastic about some points.

To explain the problem. We live in a house that has stairs from both sides. From downstairs up quite long ones and from upstairs down, it's not so bad.

He refused to read the divorce papers meet with my lawyer or even sign them. Somehow he is under the impression that if he sober up and gets clean, I will take him back. But I told him that there was a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell that would ever happen.

106,1cihq2l,AITA for wanting to go to a family reunion instead of my step-grandfather‚Äôs 80th birthday?,"I am a 24M currently living with my parents while working as an entry level Civil Engineer as they allow me to work off some of my college debt. Figured this might be somewhat important to know for context.

For further context, in the past, my mother has had a notable disdain for my father‚Äôs side of the family. She claims it‚Äôs from past interactions, but I‚Äôve never witnessed a particularly harsh interaction in my experience.

My dad recently found out that his side of the family is doing an informal family reunion sometime this August. After long coordination, they settled on one weekend due to everyone‚Äôs schedules to afford the most amount of people that can make it. Also note this is occurring one state over, so driving over one weekend is affordable and relatively quick. It‚Äôs also important to know that I have not seen the majority of his side of the family since I was 4, 20 years ago. One couple is having to travel from England as well, we are likely never going to get another chance to see them. 

My mother also realized that my step-grandfather on her side of the family is turning 80 this year. Being an important age milestone and the fact that we have not visited him since I was in high school, we figured we‚Äôd travel this year. Coencidentily, his birthday falls on the same weekend of the planned reunion. Keep in mind, we do see him at least every other year as we all travel for holidays. He lives multiple states away in Texas, so ease and expense of traveling is somewhat of an issue. 

Last night, we were eating dinner together when my father mentioned the reunion and asked if I wanted to go. Of course I said yes, but I had not remembered my step-grandfathers birthday. I don‚Äôt know if it was the mention of the event or my willingness to go, but my mother became noticeably frustrated with the discussion. She said something along the lines of, ‚Äúif the reunion doesn‚Äôt impact your grandfather‚Äôs birthday, you have my permission to go‚Äù. The mention of her permission somewhat stung and felt imposing, so I gently responded with, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware I needed your permission‚Äù. 

I did not raise my voice, but obviously the tone didn‚Äôt help. From that she became more furious and stormed out during dinner. She later angrily texted my dad and I stating that she felt like she was being bullied about the situation based on that conversion and separate ones between my dad and her. I have no idea what those conversions looked like as they were private.

110,1cigu4z,AITA for not forcing my daughter to do her friend's homework so she can graduate?,"I (42f) have a daughter, ""Mia"" (17f) who attends online school, and her best friend is ""Emily"" (17f) who she met in the 6th grade.

Last year, Mia started slipping with her grades a lot.  She did have trouble in school before, but it was usually just math and science based subjects that she struggled with, and reached out for help when she needed it.

This was due to a mental health crisis since our house had burned down, and a lot of valuable things were lost. Also varying health scares and surgeries with close family members.

I put Mia into counselling and I worked out a deal with her school, where in short, she'd only have to keep her grades passing or above passing in order to graduate.

Mia improved a lot after that, and she has been keeping her grades above passing ever since then.  Her graduation is next month.

""Susan"" (45f). Emily's mom had gotten the same deal, but Emily hasn't bothered trying to keep it up.  Emily also has struggled in school, but from what Susan and my daughter says, she doesn't try to actually improve.  Mia herself has tried to help Emily in the subjects she does well in (English and History) in the past and it did work for a little bit, but then her grades dropped again.

I was on the phone with Susan earlier, and she was venting to me about how if Emily didn't complete her overdue work and get her grades up in the next two weeks ( May 17th is their last day to turn in school work except for credit classes), she wouldn't graduate and would have to repeat senior year.

She then asked me if Mia could take on the responsibility of getting the majority of Emily's work done, so that Emily can have passing grades and graduate.

I was really shocked that she would ask that and asked if she was joking.  Susan confirmed she was in fact, not joking around and said it would be really nice of my daughter to help out her best friend like that.

I gave her a hard no. Not only was that super against the school's policies, and could get them both kicked out before graduation, but Emily has an insane amount of overdue work and Mia has her own work to focus on that would really hurt her grades if ignored in favor of Emily's.

Susan tried to argue with, and plead her case to me but I hung up on her without thinking. Later on, Susan sent me multiple screenshots of Emily's overdue homework ( 28 in total) and said that Mia would only have to do half of that.

I told this to my husband, thinking he'd agree with me that it's an insane request, but to my surprise he said that I should consider it since Mia is doing way better in school than she was before, and Emily has been her best friend for 7 years.

He also that it would probably make both girls feel horrible if one graduated while the other got left behind.

Fast forward a month and I asked her if I could come swing by and pick it up and she told me she had drank the rest of it. And yes I had asked to pick it up a couple times before but I got too busy. I told her that was fine as long as she paid me back for what she drank and she surprisingly refused and told me that $10 was enough and I shouldn‚Äôt have left it at her house that long. I was so surprised by this response. I told her that I‚Äôm sorry I left it at your house but I had been busy with work and the timing was just never right but just because I left it at your house doesn‚Äôt mean you have the right to it. She responded with a one word ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and pretty much left it at that. I‚Äôm not sure if she thinks that I want her to pay the entire bill but I clarified that I just want her to pay me back for what I drank. The bottle of wine was more than $10 alone. The other thing that bothers me is she never asked me if she could drink it. I think I would‚Äôve been less upset if she did but now I‚Äôm down all those drinks and the money I used to spend them. This is not the first time she has tried to not pay me back but I‚Äôm genuinely surprised at how she responded to this. To give a bit more background, she has also left a couple of things at my place for a decent amount of time but I also made the effort to give it back. I made the point that just because they were at my house for this period of time doesn‚Äôt mean I decided they were mine now. I knew she had probably forgotten and gave it back. This was when she just gave me the one work ‚Äúsorry‚Äù response. So am I the asshole for leaving my alcohol at my friends house and asking them to pay me back?",1.0,0.08489347994327545,0,0

She lives on her own but uses for convenience. Ive struggled with paranoia since kid. Partner helps me cope. I know its not their problem, they are supportive. We call each other soulmates. It is common knowledge that we dont keep secrets between us. Partner said they dont care if I look at their phone. I txt for them occasionally if they are busy. With their help my paranoia is down.

Health/money issues has us stressed. Were frustrated and argue some. Like all relationships we have highs/lows. We both know were low and were waiting on less stressful days. Daughter hates inconvenience and has tantrums. She was upset about running errands. She came over complaining, going back and forth from her room. I was cooking. She was in the room next to mine asking Partner where a speaker was. I have two and she likes a certain one. I thought I had left it elsewhere. She says she got it. I call out and say the speaker she likes is in another room. Very condescendingly said she has it then fake laughs. She makes snide remarks and pretends its ajoke. Usually I let it go but how she said it upset me. I said it wasnt funny. She muttered something and stormed off.

Partner got angry txts. Partner defended me, offending daughter. Daughter txted that if she spoke to me she would curse me out. Daughter will be mad for a week then start talking to me again like nothing happened. For the sake of peace I let it go.

Today I woke up before Partner they are a heavy sleeper andcant wake up to alarms. Partner likes when I listen for ringing and check alerts. When I checked Partners phone I remembered Daughters txts. I looked at txts to better understand what was told to me. Most of it was her saying how I was wrong for getting an attitude, she was being funny. Then she said I was vile and despicable to Partner. I know Partner and I had been arguing but I didnt think it was bad. Our fights are like bickering. I then looked for what made them think this. I found a complaint from Partner about frustration. I understand that people rant. I dont mind Partner ranting and I take this as a way to better myself. Daughters response shocked me. She told Partner to leave me. I was surprised. I typed my name in the search and read what was said about me. I saw more times that Daughter told Partner to leave me. Partner would complain and Daughter would be nasty about me. Partner never acknowledged Daughters comment.

Partner assured me they didnt want to leave me that they talked to her over the phone before were Daughter said to leave me and Partner said no I was their soulmate. Knowing this happened more upset me. Partner got upset and told me not to go through the phone. I felt like a slimy AH. I aid that I was upset with Daughter wanting them to leave me. They said they understand the way I feel. It feels like my paranoid habits are back. AITA?

Edit to add info:
Bc of character limit it was hard to explain everything right.

Daughter is 30ish yro, not a teen.

I am disabled because of the paranoia and a couple of other things. Partner and I established from the start of the relationship to be 100% transparent. Bc of this I haven't looked through the phone in almost 2years.

We are all in individual therapy. Mine and my partners therapist are both happy that we communicate so well and are open about everything.

The only reason me and partner got upset with each other is that I wanted them to acknowledge how hurtful their daughter was about leaving me, and they were dismissive about it.

114,1cifzig,AITA for telling my boyfriend to continue parking in the spot in front of my house when my sister asked him not to?,"I (F23) have been with my bf (M24) for around 3 years now and he has been driving for a year and a half of that. My sister (F24) has been driving for for about 4 or 5 years and would usually park in the space right in front of our house. We have a driveway that our parents also use but it's not big enough for more than one car.

Parking was never much of an issue even after my bf got his started driving, he would take whatever space was available near our house, which sometimes was my sister's usual space but if he couldn't get that it was fine, there is almost always room to park across the road from our house (like 20 extra steps at most).

My sister left travelling with her bf for 6 months and now she's been home for a few months and kept telling my boyfriend to stop parking directly in front of our house in ""her"" space and we laughed it off. I see why it's normal to be frustrated when you can't get the closest possible space to your home so we didn't take it too seriously until recently when she sent my boyfriend a really rude text asking him if he had learning disabilities because he hadn't comprehended that that was her space after her telling him multiple times that it was. This was a day when parking was limited in our neighbourhood and she had to park 2 houses down from ours because ""her"" space wasn't available but does she expect him to leave that space free and hope no one else takes it before she gets home and have us have to walk further because she is ""more entitled""?

My brothers have said that they see both sides because one of her arguments is that it's not his house and he doesn't live there but they became more unsure when they learned that when I recently passed my driving test she warned me not to take her space and I said that's fine because it's harder to get in to. She is asking our parents to speak to my bf about it and they are trying to tell us that we should just let her have the spot to stop the arguing but she is acting entitled and none of us can reserve a space close to the house so why does she think that she can? They know I'm more of a pushover so they are trying to get me to give in but she was so rude to my bf about it I can't just let her have it.

It would be different if she asked him nicely that if there was space across the road to park there instead but yesterday the other side of the road was totally clear apart from my car and she just blocked our driveway and moved her car twice to let our dad out and have him move it this morning to go to work instead of parking there. She came into the house and just said to my bf that she's told him about this already and to stop parking in her space.

I'm thinking of just putting my car in the space to see if it makes a difference to her approach but it really shouldn't as both of us use both cars now anyway.

115,1cifyu6,AITA for refusing to participate in my cousins' church ceremony?,"My (18F) Baba was born in the Soviet Union and is Russian Orthodox. So, my older cousins and my older sister speak, read/write Russian fluently. However, as my Baba got older and she had more grandchildren, she lacked the time and energy to continue dragging us to Saturday school and teaching us the language. I am grandkid number thirteen, I speak very little Russian, and I can't read/write it at all.

My cousin Madelina is turning thirteen, which is a huge milestone and represents becoming a woman. As the next oldest cousin, I am expected to sort of 'mentor' her through the process. As I've gotten older I've really enjoyed teaching my younger cousins about our culture, so I agreed, and it's been a lot of fun.

However my aunt recently asked me if I'd looked at the readings I'd be doing. I should have known there were readings, but I assumed my next oldest cousin Annastaczia would be doing them, as I did one at my ceremony and it went disastrously. Baba had to anglicize it for me so I could read it, and my pronunciation was so terrible my family joked that I was speaking Spanish. I still get jokes made about it to this day, all in jest, but it's still a bit hurtful.

I joked to my aunt that I could only read it if it was written in Spanish, but eventually realised she was serious. After talking to my Baba and members of the Church I found they were highly reluctant to let others step in, as it was traditional for the next oldest girl to do it. They told me just to practice, but it's a long bible passage, not easily memorized.

I told my Baba I would not do the reading and she was extremely upset with me. I offered to read it in English, or let Annastaczia or another cousin do it. She told me I was selfish for taking away from Madelina's day, and that if I didn't want to mentor I should have said no from the beginning. The dress had already been bought for me as a surprise, and my Baba had hand embroidered me and Madelina matching traditional hair covers especially.

My whole family is furious with me and Madelina is distraught - she says I've taken away the 'tradition' of her day, and I shouldn't have agreed to mentor her if I didn't want to. I apologized, but my aunt (Madelina's mum) told me not to bother coming to the ceremony, and that if I really felt that way about church I shouldn't worry about going anymore.

I feel terrible. I just can't embarrass myself and my whole family like that again. It's a small Church and people talk, and everyone was so disappointed in me when I screwed it up last time. I hate to have let Madelina down, and I know I should have known there would be a reading in the first place, but I also thing it's unfair that they expect me to do it knowing how it went last time.

Amidst the chaos of adjusting to our new lives, dad's girlfriend at the time asked if we wanted to adopt one of her kittens, born from a recent litter of barn kittens. Despite our initial reluctance due to the overwhelming load we were already carrying, she persisted, constantly asking if we were willing to adopt a cat, which we said no to.  
  
Months rolled by, and as we settled into our lives, the idea of pet ownership began to feel less daunting. In December 2023, we finally decided to take her up on her offer. Upon meeting the kitten, we noticed its skittish demeanor, particularly around my dad's girlfriend. She confessed to struggling to coax the cat into eating, hinting at its delicate nature as the runt of the litter. We were also concerned when we observed her laissez-faire attitude towards letting the kitten roam outside unsupervised for extended periods.  
  
Despite the initial apprehension, the kitten gradually warmed up to us over the weeks, becoming more comfortable and allowing us to hold her without resistance. It seemed we were providing her with the care and affection she needed, fostering a happy and secure environment within our apartment.  
  
Several weeks later, my roommate and I made the decision to formalize our commitment. We met with my dad's girlfriend, expressing our desire to officially adopt the cat as a permanent member of our household. Graciously, my dad‚Äôs ex-girlfriend confirmed that she was okay with this agreement. She also offered to cover the pet fees associated with adoption. However, in mid-February, my dad and his girlfriend broke up.  
  
In April, my dad's ex-girlfriend approached us, demanding the return of the cat, citing the dissolution of her relationship with my father as her reasoning. Despite our prior agreement and her commitment to cover the pet fees, she went back on her promises.  
  
We asserted our ownership rights and the responsibilities we had upheld. Yet, she resorted to harassment, reaching out to my family and friends to tell them we were thieves and stole the cat.  
  
She started bombarding us with messages from various phone numbers, attempting to force us into submission. Faced with mounting pressure and harassment, I finally responded, presenting evidence of our prior agreements and her explicit consent to our ownership of the cat.

118,1cif4ms,AITA for turning down a nice request immediately seconds after I said yes?,"I don't know if this will get much attention it's pretty minor. But I still feel like I might have been disrespectful to seemingly two very kind people.

My (F26) experience with door-to-door missionaries are short, honest, and polite. I'd say I'm sorry I'm not interested in religion and decline the pamphlet explaining it would be a waste to give it to me. They nicely say have a good day and go to the next door. Unfortunately for these two missionaries (looked fairly young maybe 20s M & F) they caught me at a bad time.

I was coming home working a 10 hour shift. The 2 saw me pulling into the parking lot and waited for me to come out of my car. The young man did all the talking. Did the usual pleasantries of ""how are you's"" and then he gave me the ""would you like the learn the word of God"" and I gave my automatic response of ""I'm sorry, no, I'm not interested in religion"". When he offered his pamphlet, I kind of went off script. I said ""No, I'm sorry I had a pretty rough day at work. I'd be too tired to do any reading tonight so I'm afraid it'll be a waste on me"".

The man said he was sorry to hear that and then he asked me if I would like it if they prayed for me. I just said ""that's ok I don't mind"" and was expecting him to say ""I hope you have a good day"" and I can say it back to them and we'll go on our day. But what he said next shocked me. He asked me, ""would you like to do this in your car or in your apartment?"". My mind instantly went to people praying over someone, everyone putting their hands on them to heal them. Having strangers hovering over me and touching me made me feel uncomfortable so I just went ""uuuuuuuhhhhhh no sorry nevermind"". They both smiled, probably finding my awkwardness funny (valid). Then the guy said ""we'll keep you in our prayers tonight"" and then said our ""have a good day's"".

I thought this would be a silly little story to tell my friends and family. One suggested I could have asked to have the prayer right there standing on the sidewalk which no, even then I wouldn't want that. When I agreed to the prayer, I thought they were going to do it in private. Still I felt like I was rude to them, especially since I know prayer is important to Christians. And I was touched by the sentiment. I just, y'know, didn't want to be touched. But even then, my assumption of that might have still be wrong. My brother and a few friends think they weren't going to put their hands on me, just put their hands to the sky or holding their bibles. Which makes me feel bad for my assumption.

I was coming home working a 10 hour shift. The 2 saw me pulling into the parking lot and waited for me to come out of my car. The young man did all the talking. Did the usual pleasantries of ""how are you's"" and then he gave me the ""would you like the learn the word of God"" and I gave my automatic response of ""I'm sorry, no, I'm not interested in religion"". When he offered his pamphlet, I kind of went off script. I said ""No, I'm sorry I had a pretty rough day at work. I'd be too tired to do any reading tonight so I'm afraid it'll be a waste on me"".

The man said he was sorry to hear that and then he asked me if I would like it if they prayed for me. I just said ""that's ok I don't mind"" and was expecting him to say ""I hope you have a good day"" and I can say it back to them and we'll go on our day. But what he said next shocked me. He asked me, ""would you like to do this in your car or in your apartment?"". My mind instantly went to people praying over someone, everyone putting their hands on them to heal them. Having strangers hovering over me and touching me made me feel uncomfortable so I just went ""uuuuuuuhhhhhh no sorry nevermind"". They both smiled, probably finding my awkwardness funny (valid). Then the guy said ""we'll keep you in our prayers tonight"" and then said our ""have a good day's"".

I thought this would be a silly little story to tell my friends and family. One suggested I could have asked to have the prayer right there standing on the sidewalk which no, even then I wouldn't want that. When I agreed to the prayer, I thought they were going to do it in private. Still I felt like I was rude to them, especially since I know prayer is important to Christians. And I was touched by the sentiment. I just, y'know, didn't want to be touched. But even then, my assumption of that might have still be wrong. My brother and a few friends think they weren't going to put their hands on me, just put their hands to the sky or holding their bibles. Which makes me feel bad for my assumption.

We talked about it for awhile and at first she was slightly on board even admitting she really misses how close her and her dad used to be and she‚Äôd like to go back to that, but now she‚Äôs making slightly better money at her job and everything has changed, she wants to move 30 minutes closer to family, making a 45 minute to her work but a 3 1/2 hour drive from family, and I told her that‚Äôs not what I want and she blew up on me, saying that I‚Äôm selfish. Last night we sat down and talked and she told me she‚Äôs nervous that she won‚Äôt make as good of money down home, quick little back story, I work for a union, so I travel for work, usually not very far and they try to station me in areas close to where I live (normally 45 minutes to an hour) so I know we will make good money still, and we both know we will like being closer to family I like to live life by what I know so I think taking the risk of making slightly less money to be with people we love and care about is worth it, and hell she might even make more money there.

Update: This is definitely not the update I was expecting to type out, but here it is.

About 6 months ago, her cousin (23f) moved in to the same complex. There is 12 units, 8 with washer and dryer hookups, and 4 units on the lower level without them. However, there is a hallway in the basement that has washers and dryers that take quarters. For the first couple of weeks, she would use them but complain that the dryer never dried all the way and would also borrow our quarters. After that, she has brought her laundry to our apartment on average 3 times a week.

Sometimes she‚Äôs good at getting them that day, but most times I‚Äôm the one switching the load over as we have lots of laundry that needs washed almost daily.

Anyways, she has started to bring his laundry over too, and that‚Äôs the last straw for me. I don‚Äôt want to wash their clothes, especially with my own. 

I want to add that we don‚Äôt pay for water, and she does bring her own detergent over so money isn‚Äôt the issue, but I just think it‚Äôs crazy to just expect to use someone else‚Äôs washer and dryer. I can‚Äôt quite put into words exactly why I don‚Äôt want them to bring their laundry over, but I just don‚Äôt want them to?

121,1ciepwf,AITA for not telling him/lying about my past with my guy friend ?,"We met 3 months ago and have been seeing each other regularly since (2/3 times a week). He's 25M and I'm 22F. He's already met my friends and vice versa. He told me a month ago that he'll have to move in September for work (2 hours away by train), but he said he'll come every weekend because he wants to make it work.

Before he met my friends, I told him that I kept ""us"" secret - although that is false, cuz I say everything to my closest friends - he later found out (the night he met them) that my friends already knew (one of them couldn't hide) and was upset I lied to him. This was a month ago.

Later that night, I told him I'm not looking for exclusivity. Personally, I don't want to get too attached to someone who's leaving, because I don't even know if the long-distance plan will work. He said he doesn't expect anything from me and understands me. However, I still don't feel like we're on the same page. Two months ago when he met my friends (two guys), he asked me afterward if there was something between me and one of them, and I said no.

Yesterday he told me he still hangs out with his ex but there's nothing going on, as they have the same group of friends. I told him he can do whatever he wants (I genuinely don't care, no jealousy on my part). So, in that discussion, I admitted to him that I kissed one of my friends (that he had met). It happened tho a year ago once, we were just drunk and stupid, but he is my bff today and that is why I told him there was nothing between us last time he asked cuz there genuinely isn't. He seemed very upset, repeatedly telling me I lied to him. I don't understand why he is questioning me a lot and why he wants to know EVERYTHING about me although we agreed on NO exclusivity...

**He is making me feel like I'm in the wrong. Idk, am I the asshole here ? I don't know how to make up for it if that is the case.**

Well my mom has lived here two years now. She doesn't exactly pay a flat rate in rent or for other bills. She just sends money whenever. I calculated the cost and that not counting rent that's just utilities and shit. So technically she's lives rent free here. She just works and comes home and goes straight to her room. I get it I don't work I'm home all day. But I still pay for the bills. I just wanted help with dishes cause they pile up fast with 4 ppl. That was the first problem. She doesn't really try cooking atleast sometimes either. I feel like she lives rent free atleast try helping a lil more but in her head her being there shouldn't be a big deal cause wed b paying what we pay regardless and she shouldn't have to help cause shes never really home and hardly makes a mess? Anyways she's tired of living here cause she feels like we are assholes cause we feel we contribute more financially and she doesn't really help. So she wants 500 a month from me and 300 from my brother to help her move out and have her own place.

In uni I [23F] made a few friends in my same course, specific ages aren't relevant but we are all between 21 and 25. A couple of years ago I proposed to start playing different TTRPGs with them, and so we started playing sporadically, and this January we started a full campaign (with me as GM) and are playing more regularly.

An important bit of context is that one of these friends, we'll call her Lydia, is incredibly behind on her exams, like ""we're all close to graduating and she still hasn't finished taking all of her first year exams"" level of behind. Which is absolutely fine, I dropped out of uni once before starting over, so I know how it feels to struggle. I and another girl have been trying to check up on Lydia and even offered to help her with exams, but now in this semester she is straight up not attending classes and will not reply to our texts. And I mean, she won't reply for weeks. I texted her in early March and she didn't reply until two weeks later. I can try to check up on her all I want, but if she doesn't text back... I don't know what else to do.

So this longer campaign with more regular sessions that I started GMing was to me a way to check up on Lydia and make sure she was okay without harassing her with texts she wasn't going to reply to anyway.

Recently, we started having some issues with the campaign, where I realized that right now my personal workload became too much to leave me time or energy to prepare the sessions in the way I wanted, it took me so much time and I sent a text to the group chat asking if it was okay to put this campaign on hold for a while, and in the meantime I could run an official DnD campaign that is much shorter and easier for me to master.

Everyone replied agreeing to this plan, except for Lydia. I sent this message a week ago at this point, and she hasn't replied yet. I know she has seen it because this is on Whatsapp and it shows the read receipt, she even listened to the voice message I sent. Maybe she has forgotten to reply, but she hasn't even read the messages in the groupchat that have been sent after that.

I invited 2 other people to the campaign, my boyfriend and another friend. So now I have 5 players. I could definitely handle a 6th and that is not the problem, but I have a feeling that if I text Lydia about it, she won't reply for days. We want to start next week so I don't really have the time to wait for her reply and risk having to postpone the session because she might not be available.

I will ask this to my friends as well, but I ask this here so an uninvolved party can weight in and give me a different perspective on the situation. So: Would I be the asshole for not following up with her privately about this and quietly excluding her from the campaign?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-02,"WIBTA for excluding one of my [23F] friends [21-25] from a DnD campaign? Giving context for this situation is difficult but I will try to at the best of my ability. Also sorry in advance for grammar mistakes but english is not my first language and I'm typing this on my phone.

In uni I [23F] made a few friends in my same course, specific ages aren't relevant but we are all between 21 and 25. A couple of years ago I proposed to start playing different TTRPGs with them, and so we started playing sporadically, and this January we started a full campaign (with me as GM) and are playing more regularly.

126,1cidn7s,AITA for refusing my bf‚Äôs decision even though we don‚Äôt live together ?,"My boyfriend and I (both 24) have been dating for 6 months. We do not live together and do not plan to in the near future because we both love our respective apartments and neighborhoods, we are just happy with the way it is currently. However, we do spend more time together than on our own (either at his place or mine).

My boyfriend has been wanting a dog for a few years. He lives in a very small one-room apartment (20m2) that, in my sense, isn‚Äôt appropriate for a dog long term. My boyfriend agreed it was not the right time to get a dog as he is not financially stable and that he would reconsider it in a few years.

However, last week, he impulsively contacted a pug breeder to buy one. I‚Äôm in a very delicate position : we do not live together, so that decision of getting a dog belongs to him. BUT we spend most days of the week either at his place or mine, so that decision will ultimately impact me and our relationship. We talked and I express my concerns about it, which I think are valid because I‚Äôm a human like everyone else and this is a sudden change I was definitely not prepared for :

- I do not want him to bring his dog to my place. 

- My boyfriend wants the dog to sleep in his bed. Problem : my boyfriend‚Äôs bed is a single bed, we barely fit together so imagine what it would be with a dog‚Ä¶ 

- I said I won‚Äôt take the dog for walks as it is HIS dog and that I unfortunately don‚Äôt think I am currently emotionally available and have a place in my heart for a dog. He said he would never expect me to care for the dog but hey, the dog will follow us everywhere and be part of our life. What would happen if I really have no feelings towards the dog ? This could potentially make my boyfriend sad.

- We have very good sex. But I know him, he‚Äôs quite prude and having sex in front of the dog (since he wants the dog in his bed) will definitely disturb him. 

So according to my concerns, this is how I picture what it would be : I would spend more time at his place than at mine and carry a bag of clothes almost every day. I would have very uncomfortable nights and be tired all the time because the bed is too small to fit two humans and a pug + the pug potentially snoring + my boyfriend having to wake up earlier than he does today to walk the dog early in the morning witch ultimately will wake me up. We also won‚Äôt be able to have sex because yes, he confirmed it, it would be awkward for him. Wow. What a dream relationship. Makes everyone jealous.

I express all of these concerned to him but they were left unanswered. He basically confirmed the above and decided not to get a dog after signing papers at the bredeer‚Äôs

He said he would need a few days because it felt like a miscarriage. I think the word miscarriage is important here because it shows he would have considered the dog his baby and it would have been imposed to me against my will. But I feel guilty now that his dream of having a dog can‚Äôt come true (for now)

She owns it while I pay my share of costs, I don't step on how she wants it to look. She has a maximilist taste and likes unique one of a kind pieces and things that are unconventional.

We both grew up in Christian households and while neither of are religious now it still shaped us. While I'm not a practising Christian now I still have a connection to simply because it connects to my family. I still have the bible my dad gave me for my 18th birthday. She meanwhile is now anti religion and states that she has spent her life working to undo the self destructive beliefs her religious background instilled and doesn't want anything like that in her world.

She also won't tolerate anything sacrilegious or generically spiritual. This includes meditation, stories that leans too heavily into demons/witch craft or even being told ""Bless you"" when she sneezes. She found gospel music in my music collection and was horrified. I only ever listened to it privately because I grew up with it and sometimes I find it soothing but never played out loud in the house but just me having it was horrific to her. I like writing fantasy but when she found I had books on symbololgy, myths and arcane stuff that I kept for reference material she demanded I get rid of them because she didn't want that ""energy"" in her house.

I've pretty much hiden anything religious, spiritual or mystical that I'm into because I don't want have to deal with her reacting to it. I don't share many of shows or books I like because of any supernatural leaning it might have. I don't share anything I've written with her, I've given up meditation or affirmations and last time I accidentally said ""bless you"" when she sneezed she tore me a new one because she has made it clear she doesn't like it. 

Now she likes going thrift stores to find stuff for the house. A few months back a local church and school tied to it closed down and somehow pieces have made it into the local thrift stores. This included a couple of paintings and a waist high statue of Jesus that she bought and has proudly displayed because she finds them quirky and out there. She's elated about the statue in particular and starting having fun decorating it for holidays (she put a Santa hat on it for Christmas and bunny ears on it for Easter). 

I meanwhile am pissed and growing resentful even though part of me feels that it's irrational. This is her house, I have nothing against the statue and honestly if anyone else was doing what she was doing I'd probably find it amusing. The problem is that she made me feel so bad about me bringing anything remotely religious/spiritual into the house and now we have a Jesus statue and paintings that quite literally came out of Sunday school classrooms just because she thinks they're wild and fun. I want to call her out on the double standard but I can't tell if I'm being petty or unreasonable.

129,1cicx76,AITA for asking my friend of 2 years to play a certain way on valorant,"Ik most people on this subreddit are asking abt shit that actually matters, but i just need ur opinion on this.

I (13yo male) just got into an argument with my friend of 2 years( 14yo male) for the stupidest shit ever. It started from about a month and a half ago when we started playing Valorant together, and for the most part it was going great. We were having fun and everything, that was until we got level 20 in the game, allowing us to queue competitive games. Until this point, we were both ass and frequently got killed during matches, but it was more of a ""if we have fun we won"" kinda thing. But i'm extremely competitive and don't really enjoy losing, so i started trying to get better at the game bc it makes me feel happy beating others, I never dragged him into this whole thing, it was just me training maybe 30 mins a day for my aim and some other things. for him we just kept playing as usual as I tried to win more and more in games. he's the type of person to want to play a game how he wants to and doesn't really like being told what to do in almost anything. this didn't matter until one game 2 weeks ago where I asked him if he could watch one area so that the enemies couldn't push through there, he then said in a rude tone ""don't tell me how to play, it's a game just play how you're supposed to."" I replied with ""bro I'm just asking u if u can do something so tha-."" and he quickly interrupted me and said ""I. dont. care."" (the dots are there bc he paused after saying a word) And I'm not the type of person to get angry easily, with almost anyone I'm chill and laid back. so I just kinda pushed it to the side and thought something like ""oh whatever, maybe hes just having a bad day"". For the next week, day after day it got worse until he just left and stopped talking to me after this one game where he got to low health and I asked him to come back towards us for protection. Again in a rude tone ""don't tell me how to play, i got this"" he then proceeded to die and make excuses and shift the blame towards, you guessed it, me. Earlier that same game I asked if he could use his ability to flash bang them through a smoke bomb, this way we could make it easier to enter in the site. And it was the same tone, same thing he said, same death and round loss, and same excuses and of course, the same blame on me.

Here's the thing, Valorant is a team based strategic tactical shooter . remember when he said to just play the game how we're supposed to. I fucking was, I was strategizing with my teammates. Every thing he got mad at and saw as back-seating or being an annoying toxic teammate or telling him how to play the game. is strategizing and a part of the game. communicating with your teammates and form plans to beat the other team is the main theme of any team based game, not just Valorant. He's claiming I hate him for playing bad, which is the farthest thing from the truth. I've never called him out or been a dick to him for being bad at the game, bc truthfully I dont care. because I'm also not the best and even if I was good, my end goal for a game is having fun, i just seek it in more ways than one. until 2 weeks ago playing with him was fun no matter what. but then his excuses and poor sportsmanship made it a nightmare to play with him. thats why I'm annoyed with him and its also why I expressed how much of a dick he was being.

130,1ciceel,AITA for not wanting to go to my Grandfather's Brother's burial?,"Over many years, my maternal Grandpa and his family (siblings, parents, children, etc.) went no contact with his very recently deceased brother.

This happened multiple times because of the way he (Grandpa's brother) used to act in life. 

Despite the rest of the family never really forgiving him for the shit that he used to do, my Grandpa always forgave him and gave him a million chances because my Grandpa has a big heart and values blood relations greatly.

I never met the guy (Grandpa's Brother) in my entire life, and have only ever learned of his existance and the whole no contact thing when he entered the hospital two months ago.

Over that period, I have never heard of him being spoken of kindly outside of my Grandpa, all I learned was that he was a paranoid greedy asshole who used to be a doctor back in the day, and that he initially refused treatmen and had to sign a waiver as he was leaving against the first hospital's orders and recommendations.

He was warned that his case would severly worsen if he left and he insisted on leaving, claiming he knew better than the ""quacks"" there. When his case actually worsened and he got admitted to another hospital, as the first one refused taking him back, he kept unplugging machines, removing his oxygen mask, and outright refusing treatment and throwing tantrums because he just didn't feel like paying for his treatment and thought they were all quacks who didn't know shit.

I was also told that in the past, he went through four divorces in his life from how much of a psycho he was (his wives were basically running away) and that his wives were better off without him. I was also told that no one really loved him (besides my grandpa who values blood ties greatly), but was only tolerated in the family due to blood ties.

The guy will be buried in the cemetery 1.5 hours away from me, and my Grandpa is recovering from heart surgery (stress of his brother being a psycho diring that period almost did him in) so he won't be able to go to the burial.

I told my family that I will come by for the post-burial wake held nearby, but not the burial itself as I have other things to do.

Almost everyone lost their shit and told me to be a man and do my duty and go to the burial for my too forgiving, too big hearted Grandpa's sake. That if my father was alive, he'd have went. And that my uncles (father's brothers) will be going becaue ""it's their duty towards my mother and Grandpa as their in laws"".

My mother did a 180 on her now deceased uncle, and told me not to tell anyone of how the guy was actually hated, and not to tell anyone any of the psycho shit he did that I wrote above, and now she's telling me that the guy was well loved and liked by the family as if the whole previous two months of hate being thrown around didn't exist. She now says that she doesn't hate him, but disliked the stress he put my Grandpa through. 

AITA for not wanting to go to the burial? Or should I just just fold on this and go?

Edit: -

The original plan, as presented by my Grandpa himself is for me to stay with him and basically take care of him during the burial while his usual caretaker would be busy preparing the post-burial wake/reception, and then I would take him to the reception post burial when everything is ready.

But now, since my uncles are going to the burial, another family member will stay with him while I go in his stead to the burial (as he feels that he needs to be there for his in-laws) and will be meeting him at the post-burial wake/reception later.

Almost everyone lost their shit and told me to be a man and do my duty and go to the burial for my too forgiving, too big hearted Grandpa's sake. That if my father was alive, he'd have went. And that my uncles (father's brothers) will be going becaue ""it's their duty towards my mother and Grandpa as their in laws"".

My mother did a 180 on her now deceased uncle, and told me not to tell anyone of how the guy was actually hated, and not to tell anyone any of the psycho shit he did that I wrote above, and now she's telling me that the guy was well loved and liked by the family as if the whole previous two months of hate being thrown around didn't exist. She now says that she doesn't hate him, but disliked the stress he put my Grandpa through. 

AITA for not wanting to go to the burial? Or should I just just fold on this and go?

Edit: -

The original plan, as presented by my Grandpa himself is for me to stay with him and basically take care of him during the burial while his usual caretaker would be busy preparing the post-burial wake/reception, and then I would take him to the reception post burial when everything is ready.

But now, since my uncles are going to the burial, another family member will stay with him while I go in his stead to the burial (as he feels that he needs to be there for his in-laws) and will be meeting him at the post-burial wake/reception later.

Edit #2: -
I went to the burial and kept the peace, then went to the reception. It all lasted a good 5-6 hours from start to finish. Grandpa was happy. I was happy cuz Grandpa was happy.",0.0,0.09362009167671204,0,1

132,1cic0im,AITA for saying my DIL is choosing her career before her family?,"I (65M) recently visited my daughter (Nicole - 33F) and her wife Ava (35F) in their home which is in another state.

Nicole is my only child and I have no wish other than her happiness. I have never had an issue with her falling in love with a woman. What I have an issue is her partner taking advantage of her. Let me give you a basic backstory.

Ava is the definition of that successful charismatic character everyone adores. Except she is a workaholic. She's a general surgeon, will soon be an attending physician, has multiple awards, published papers, etc. She really mostly loves and cares about her job.

Nicole gave birth to their son Harry 2 months ago. Ava has only taken two days off of work, and those were around Nicole's labor. Other than that, from what I could see for the week that I was there, Nicole was mostly parenting alone. 

Ava only came around to help for an hour or two, and that is only if she had the time (she would go read or write resesech papers, work on her laptop). Nicole is overworked. Other than that, and eventually pampering Nicole with her favourite food or flowers or something, Ava is literally not doing anything else.

During a rare dinner when Ava and Nicole were both home, I casually said Ava chose her career before anything else, and didn't really help out with the parenting. Ava got very upset and left the table. Nicole followed. She later told me my comment was overly insensitive. I was just worried about my daughter.

133,1ciboo8,AITA for taking in my MIL's wedding dress?,"My BIL Jamie (30 M) is getting married in a couple of months to my SIL Emily (30F). She is a lovely woman, and I have known her for two years since she started dating Jamie. Emily has started to look for wedding dresses, and she said she would not be wearing her mother's as it was not her style. My MIL then offered her wedding dress.

For info, my in-laws got married at 18 & 20. They were then, by no means wealthy, and my MIL's wedding dress was very simple and casual. My husband is adopted, and when we were planning our wedding, my MIL offered her dress to me too. I adored it, and more than that, it was a more emotional thing than just a dress, I loved my MIL and wanted to have something of hers for my wedding. Plus, she has always felt that her wedding was very simple, so my wearing her dress meant a lot to her. Emily, however, declined the dress and said she wanted her own. This was well received by my MIL who then told me to take the dress permanently and pass it on to our kids if we wanted to, as I wore it first, it should then go to me.

However, yesterday we had dinner at our in-laws, and Emily pulled me aside and asked me if our MIL didn't like her. I assured her that was not the case, that she was lovely, and that we both were ecstatic that she was joining the family. She then, albeit very politely, said that my constant 'being joined at the hip' with my MIL and always doing everything she asks me to, makes Emily feel like our MIL loves me more, and maybe I might back off, as she feels like I'm trying too hard which is why she is falling short. My wearing my MIL's wedding dress and keeping it as an heirloom just made her look bad. Honestly, I'm not confrontational, but I told her that my relationship with my MIL was not going to change from my side and that I was extremely sorry if she felt hurt by me in any way. I then excused myself, and when we were home, I told my husband what Emily said to me. He was mad and went outside to call my BIL and I didn't hear what he said. I thought that would be it, as I asked him not to involve his parents in our issues.

Today, Emily's Maid of Honour called me and told me off for being a 'snitch' and wanting my in-laws to 'always fawn over me'. She said she couldn't believe I'd ruin a relationship over a dress and I should just give it back to make it even with Emily. She also told me to back off from my BIL's relationship as I have now caused issues between them.

Let me start by saying that I‚Äôve never been a great sleeper and I‚Äôm constantly fatigued. I mentioned this to my doctor before my last bloodwork and we ordered relevant labs to check the source. Everything turned up normal.

I (28m) am dating Vivi (26f). I have a newer phone, while Vivi has an older model. It was never an issue as neither of us is obsessed with the whole phone thing.

Vivi has a best friend Aria (24f) who she always looks up to. They have been friends since they were toddlers and Vivi has a weird obsession with Aria. Like she would copy after Aria, buy the same clothes, do the same activities, just because Aria does so. In Vivi‚Äôs eyes, Aria could never be wrong. It bothers me sometimes, but never to the point of making a scene about it.

The issue: we went on a double date (me with Vivi and Aria with her boyfriend Nate). Nate comes from another generation and although he isn‚Äôt obsessed with social media, phones and stuff like that, he has the newest IPhone Pro Max. The whole time Aria was using his phone as if it was hers since ‚Äúthe camera is better‚Äù (she also has an older phone). She was filming stories on his phone, replying to messages. Vivi was watching this and later that night she asked me if we could share my phone the way Aria and Nate do.

The problem is, I have my social media on my phone, I use it myself. I‚Äôm not uncomfortable with the idea of Vivi seeing my private DMs, but having her accounts, notifications and other stuff on my phone would be bothersome and messy. Perhaps if I was a boomer who only uses his phone to take pictures, make calls and post on Facebook, it would be different, but I have active social media presence and I don‚Äôt want my stuff to be mixed with Vivi‚Äôs. Not to mention that I don‚Äôt want to turn our relationship into some weird Aria x Nate LARP.

The conflict: I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù and explained, why. Vivi said that Aria‚Äôs boyfriend is okay with that, I explained that I‚Äôm not Aria‚Äôs boyfriend. She said that Aria said it‚Äôs more convenient and shows the mutual trust. I said that I trust her, she can go through my phone at any given moment, but I don‚Äôt want to have her social media accounts there.

The whole time Aria was using his phone as if it was hers since ‚Äúthe camera is better‚Äù (she also has an older phone). She was filming stories on his phone, replying to messages. Vivi was watching this and later that night she asked me if we could share my phone the way Aria and Nate do.

The problem is, I have my social media on my phone, I use it myself. I‚Äôm not uncomfortable with the idea of Vivi seeing my private DMs, but having her accounts, notifications and other stuff on my phone would be bothersome and messy. Perhaps if I was a boomer who only uses his phone to take pictures, make calls and post on Facebook, it would be different, but I have active social media presence and I don‚Äôt want my stuff to be mixed with Vivi‚Äôs. Not to mention that I don‚Äôt want to turn our relationship into some weird Aria x Nate LARP.

The conflict: I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù and explained, why. Vivi said that Aria‚Äôs boyfriend is okay with that, I explained that I‚Äôm not Aria‚Äôs boyfriend. She said that Aria said it‚Äôs more convenient and shows the mutual trust. I said that I trust her, she can go through my phone at any given moment, but I don‚Äôt want to have her social media accounts there. She backed off, but she was sulking and I heard her call Aria and complain about me.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if she was unreasonable when she asked me to let her use my phone as if it was hers or if I was an asshole to her. After all, it‚Äôs not really a massive thing, definitely not worth fighting over in my book.",0.0,0.01360629964619875,0,1

It has two rooms, one is bigger with an ensuite and the other is a single. I didn't want to live alone for safety reasons, so I posted about getting a roommate (them having the ensuite). I got lots of messages, but when people found out I was the landlord, they usually left the conversations. I was very upfront that I wanted clean/tidy/organised/quiet/non-drinking people and my sister said that was probably sending a 'toxic message' since I was also the landlord. So I stopped mentioning that and very shortly after I found people.

They're a really nice engaged couple (F29 and M28) and though I wouldn't say we are close best friends, but we are friendly, have dinner together sometimes and the living situation has been really nice. The rent was on the cheaper side of average in our area, we split bills, streaming and internet etc. But they did not know I was the landlord.

I will fully admit, I can be a strict. I hate things being messy/disorganised/loud, and especially since I am the owner I want things sorted quickly to avoid damages. So a few times I have scheduled ""checks"" to get things rolling if they're being pushed aside and mentioned I might have to complain if things weren't tidied up properly.

Recently, the girl had some health issues and has been working less, which means they have been struggling on rent payments. Again, I don't *need* their money to pay off the mortgage, but have been using it to help give me some extra money.

I decided to come clean and mentioned I would cut the rent payments fully until she got better and found stable work again. They were nice about it and took the deal until she got better. They then moved about last month and I went on the search for new roommates.

They started trashing me to everyone they knew about how I lied about being the landlord, was a strict pain in the ass bitch, was trying to steal their money in a cost of living crisis to pay off my debts etc.

Word has gotten around and I've actually stopped taking enquires. Some of my friends and family members are saying I was an asshole and should have been honest about it from the get go, others are saying I didn't owe them that information and ended up doing them a favour.

I don't really know what to believe. Was I the asshole?

EDIT: They were paying for a single room together like what someone alone would have been paying, it wasn't doubled because they were two people, I didn't need the extra money, I just wanted to live with people to feel safer at home. What I was doing was legal where I am (I checked beforehand). No I wasn't ridiculously strict (they could have a drink, just not parties and big groups) and I did give good timelines for any 'inspections' far above the minimum requirement.

  
Just for clarity, for damages I meant things like a window being left open and it rained so water damage was a concern. Breaking the front door lock after using the wrong key and it needing replacing. Replacing their toaster because the wires were exposed and I was worried about a potential fire. Their habit of leaving the stove turned on with nothing on it.

147,1ci9dqr,AITA for going out for 3.5hrs with friends while spouse was ill.,"
The other day, my husband (32M) woke up having a tummy ache and diarrhea from food poisoning. While I (31F) spent the morning and most afternoon trying to make him comfortable and checking on him. 

He slept through most of the afternoon while I watched TV. Then by 5pm I decided to meet up with some friends over some tea since I have been stuck at home for the past two weekends and really I needed some time to be social, when I asked him if I can go out and see them he said ‚Äúokay‚Äù.

So off I went to see my friends. His dinner was ready as he had ordered it in advance. While, I was out with friends they decided that we could have dinner together. I gave it some thought since my husband was stuck at home, so I message him telling him I‚Äôll be joining them for dinner and he replied with an ‚Äúok baby‚Äù. Then I messaged him back asking ‚Äúhow are you and would you like any soup?‚Äù, he said ‚Äúhis temp has climbed up and not to buy soup but buy some meds‚Äù

So I had my dinner with friends and left them by 8:00pm to buy medicine for him. By 8:30pm I was home with the meds and went to check on him. He was definitely warmer and I offered help. He said ‚Äúno‚Äù and was kind of ignoring me for the next 30 minutes. I knew something was off with all the ignoring. Eventually, I asked him again if there was anything I could do to help him feel better. He asked if I could buy some juice and pick up his food for the following day, then I went to get the juice and pick up his food. 

The rest of the night seemed okay. The following day, I asked him if he was feeling better. He was and fever has gone down. I asked him if he wanted me to stay home for the day, he said no need. Everything seemed fine, then things got emotional when I asked him if he was pissed at me last night for going out. Apparently, he was pissed for leaving him alone sick. I told him, he should‚Äôve told me to come home and not join the dinner. He shoot back and said  ‚Äúhe would never leave me all alone sick and I should have known better‚Äù. 

He continued with ‚Äúnext time you get sick, I‚Äôll also go out with friends‚Äù. I was hurt and truly felt bad for being a terrible partner. I told him ‚ÄúI am not a mind reader and when I told you that we‚Äôll be having dinner together, you gave me an okay‚Äù and continued with ‚Äúyou should be more direct next time‚Äù.  

He just reiterated that next time when I‚Äôm sick, he‚Äôll be out with his friends so I could feel what he felt. I bawled my eyes out and apologized for what happened. But now I see things more objectively, I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong. 

We‚Äôve been together as a couple for 5 years and married less than a year. We rarely fight but when we do it always seems like I am on the wrong. Don‚Äôt get wrong we love each other very much but it seems like communication is not his strong point.

148,1ci9cpt,AITA for not prioritizing my mom? ,"My husband bought a new car however we still have a month left on our old car.

I decided to give the car to my sister who has a newborn and is going to move to a new place in a few weeks, shes the first person that came to mind because of this. We have decided on a time and date for my sister to come over and get the old car from my place

On the morning of handover, my dad instead calls me asking me what time can he pick up the car as my mom wants to use it to visit her relatives.

I was confused so I texted my sister to clarify. Apparently there were talks behind my back about how my mom was sad that I did not ask her first if she wanted the car, and she quoted that a year and a half back my husband mentioned of selling the old car for a small sum and my mom expressed interest in it. 

My mom does not have a drivers licence and it was a conversation we had while walking to the supermarket at the time. It was our mistake we did not take her interest seriously and we forgot that the conversation happened so it is indeed our mistake on that. 

I called my mom to apologize but she was shocked and said the conversation did not happen and she was perfectly ok with me giving my sister the car. 

So I texted my sister back and apparently my eldest sis (who hates me) was the one who told her about the whole convo about my mom. 

Anyway at this point I really don‚Äôt know who to trust. I told her she can come to get the car and we can get this over and done with. 

My sister comes and I asked her if I could see what my eldest sis texted but she was defensive and did not want to disclose what was discussed and refused to show me the convo. She said I was a ‚Äúbad daughter‚Äù for not asking my mom first and so I said if this is making things worse, I can just sell it off or give it to someone else.

She flipped out even more saying what‚Äôs wrong with me why can I just give the car to my mom?
She insulted me and my husband and things got heated. 

I called my mom again and yet again mom was super nice and said she‚Äôs fine. 

So I said its fine and so my sis drove off with the car.

At the end of the day my sister felt guilty and showed me the convo, indeed it was my mom who expressed to my eldest sis how disappointed she was in me for giving my second sis the car. My eldest sis was the one who forwarded the texts to my second sis.

I feel so lost and confused. What I intended as a simple gesture at the start then turned into me feeling guilty and apologizing to everyone at the end of the day.

149,1ci9c9m,WIBTA if I(26F) date my friend's friend after he(21M) confessed his crush on me? ,"For context, I met my friend at work a little over a year ago. We're part of the same friend group and we all used to get along with no issues until around 2 months ago. 

This guy, I'll call him Dude, was the adorable younger one in our group. He used to bring snacks or drinks for us, treat us to food and always seemed to do it happily. He stopped abruptly and even stopped talking to us for a few days until we got him to open up and he claimed we never did those things for him, which was a lie because we all do it for everyone in the group, although not daily as he wanted. 

I was the first one to reach out, he came around and I'm regretting it now. We used to talk daily at work and went on breaks all together or just the 2 of us, he told me about his life (he's an awful person towards people he isn't close to and I didn't know until D-Day) and I even told him about a guy I started to like not even a month ago who turned out to be his friend in another department. 

Dude was upset, I noticed and asked about it but he brushed me off. He spoke shit about his friend (mostly lies, I know now) and that night, he texted me to say he likes me, he's jealous of and hates my crush, I'm so pretty, he's not enough and ""I'm up there while he's so down here"" whatever that means. Also, he said I didn't like him because he's 5 years younger than me, but I like Crush and he's the same age, so he should have a chance! 

Dude was angry when I rejected him, although I was as kind as anyone in that situation could be, but he said he understood, asked if we can still be friends and I stupidly agreed. He only asked me not to talk about my crush with him and not to tell the others, which I wasn't planning on doing. 

Crush asked me out the next day after a short conversation and I obviously said yes but didn't have time to ask my other friends not to mention it with Dude around, so they did and he told me I could have waited and I'm a liar because I didn't like guys his age or I wouldn't be crushing on Crush, left our table and told everyone that I played with his feelings, including Crush. 

My friends don't believe him, know he's playing victim because they figured he liked me way before he told me and knew I didn't feel the same. They wondered why tf would he even tell me if he knew I was into someone else. 

Crush asked me to reconsider it if I wanted to, since he didn't want to hurt our friend. I told him if he's okay with it, then I was too. Whatever we do is none of Dude's business. He agreed but still asked me to think about it and make sure I was okay, he didn't want to make me lose a friend. 

Dude is problematic. Crush is sweet, I wouldn't like him otherwise.

152,1ci95zi,"AITA for ignoring my ""bsf"" ?","Me and her have known since we were in kindergarden. In middle school we lost contact due to us being in different classes but always remained on good terms and eventually got closer again. Now we are in highschool and here is where everything went downhill between us. It started almost 8 months ago, when she changed class. For context, we were never in the same class, she was in a class full of bad people that treated her like garbage so it's a relief she's not there anymore. 

Anyway, she quickly got close with one of her new classmates and i was and still am happy for her, but I feel like she's slowly forgetting about me. At first it was all right and we even hang out for a bit all together after school. They clicked fast. Beside her classmate, in mid august she met another girl and, unlike with her classmate, they didn't became friends instantly. At first she kind of hated her but still talk and hang out with her. Sometimes she would complain about her behavior to me and they even argued in mid october. After that, I don't know how but they started to hang out again and included also the classmate. From then on, they became a trio.

She started to hang out more with them and less with me and sometimes ignore me. Our conversations became insignificant. It got to the point where she would contact me just to know what busses were there at the time she needed. And she needed those to go hang out with her new friends. She did this for the entire december. Not even a ""merry xmas"" or ""happy new year"". She continued to ask but eventually i got tired and stop responding. Since then, i've been trying to avoid her, witch was really easy cause she would ignore me, but sometimes she'd chat with me outside school, like nothing happened. It really bothers me. She ingore me but when she needs something, she just asks, like everything is fine.

I feel like shit for ignoring her and not do anything about our friendship but at the same time i'm annoyed with her. I want to keep being friends with her but if it is a one way thing i can't do much. Sometimes i feel like she expect an apology from me but for what? For have left her space with her new friends? I really don't know what I did wrong for her to think I owe her an apology.

AITA?",No A-holes here,2024-05-02,"AITA for ignoring my ""bsf"" ? Me and her have known since we were in kindergarden. In middle school we lost contact due to us being in different classes but always remained on good terms and eventually got closer again. Now we are in highschool and here is where everything went downhill between us. It started almost 8 months ago, when she changed class. For context, we were never in the same class, she was in a class full of bad people that treated her like garbage so it's a relief she's not there anymore. 

Anyway, she quickly got close with one of her new classmates and i was and still am happy for her, but I feel like she's slowly forgetting about me. At first it was all right and we even hang out for a bit all together after school. They clicked fast. Beside her classmate, in mid august she met another girl and, unlike with her classmate, they didn't became friends instantly. At first she kind of hated her but still talk and hang out with her. Sometimes she would complain about her behavior to me and they even argued in mid october. After that, I don't know how but they started to hang out again and included also the classmate. From then on, they became a trio.

She started to hang out more with them and less with me and sometimes ignore me. Our conversations became insignificant. It got to the point where she would contact me just to know what busses were there at the time she needed. And she needed those to go hang out with her new friends. She did this for the entire december. Not even a ""merry xmas"" or ""happy new year"". She continued to ask but eventually i got tired and stop responding. Since then, i've been trying to avoid her, witch was really easy cause she would ignore me, but sometimes she'd chat with me outside school, like nothing happened. It really bothers me. She ingore me but when she needs something, she just asks, like everything is fine.

153,1ci94ls,AITA for asking my friend to buy me new towels after she stained mine with makeup?,"My (20sF) friend (30sF) recently came to stay with me for a week last minute. I was not expecting her at all, she came to visit my city and while we were out to lunch, she mentioned that she didn‚Äôt have a place to sleep that night as she didn‚Äôt get a hotel and ‚Äúwould have to put it on her credit card‚Äù. I ignored it at first because she didn‚Äôt really ask, but for about 30 minutes she kept mentioning how she had nowhere to go and finally I offered to let her crash at mine until Friday. She asked if I was sure and I said yes - I would be annoyed as I live alone, but she‚Äôs a friend in need of a quick place to crash and I‚Äôve been known to let people sleep on my couch before, though never for that long.

Cut to her stay - she is a lot. She cooks for every meal and insists I eat her cooking (I‚Äôm uncomfortable with this as I got a weird vibe & I usually eat at the office, not at home). She sits all night watching movies and when I try to sit with her for a quiet shared moment, she won‚Äôt stop talking. Even over HER favorite films. She is constantly asking ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù Every 5 minutes. I assured her multiple times that if I had an issue with her I felt needed addressing, I would address it. She still kept asking if I was mad at her every day. I finally told her the constant asking was too much and she continued to do it. She was constantly correcting me on things I know how to do. But the cherry on top was the towels - the day I went to lunch with her, I ordered brand new cotton towels in my favorite color. When they arrived, I told her they were new (she saw the package) but allowed her to use them as she was my guest.  I also gave her a special makeup removing washcloth for her makeup.

Well, she used my brand new towels to remove her makeup. She wears a LOT of it, so they were badly stained. As soon as I noticed, I told her she had to stop and use the proper washcloth I gave her (worth noting, she brought her own smaller version of that same washcloth). She apologized and offered to wash them, which I accepted. Well, she left on Saturday (a day late) and she never washed them. The stains are still there. I finally tried and I can‚Äôt get them out. I texted her the following, but was told after I sent it that I was being an asshole by my sister:

‚ÄúHey, so I‚Äôve been trying to wash the makeup stains out from the towels you used while you stayed with me but unfortunately it‚Äôs not working for all of them. Tried shout, oxi clean, borax (I cannot use bleach as they‚Äôre color). Would you be able to purchase new ones? While I normally wouldn‚Äôt mind a stain, I did literally just purchase them brand new a day before you came so the fact they immediately got stains on them is kinda rough.

My oldest does club sports. Usually practice is close, today it was an hour away. I got her a ride with her friend 20 minutes away. She spent the night at this friend 2 weeks ago. My husband and I both dropped her off. 

She messaged me her ETA around 8pm. I left the two toddlers with my husband and took the baby. The toddlers have been on BS.

Before I left I looked pretty exasperated because my husband gave me a kiss bye and said ‚Äúwhen you get home take a shower everything will be okay! Just relax.‚Äù

I pull in the driveway, ask how far she is, she said 2 minutes at exactly 8:25pm, and I put my phone on the dash, get out climb in the back and feed the baby.

Growing up, my father was an alcoholic, if he was drunk, hungover or even sober, he was always angry at something. He went from having two beers a night to three or four beers and a bottle of wine¬†by himself.¬†

He and my mum (49) had been married for nearly 27 years, while she, my brother and my sister all know he is an alcoholic.

He took my sister to her weekend activities,¬†played¬†games with my brother. While I was the problem middle child with all the mental health issues. (I have depression and anxiety)

I stood up for myself. This meant we butted heads A LOT, but it was also his outlet. He would actively seek out confrontation with me. He would find anything I did wrong and yell at me.¬†

He would joke about mental health, sexist jokes, homophobic jokes. All of these, I would call him out on.

When I was 17, my parents finally separated. My mum and dad had a amicable divorce and she even helped him move out.

Before he left, I asked him calmly, ""Dad, do you want a relationship with me? I'm nearly 18, I don't have to see you and you don't have to see me. So, do you want a relationship with me?"" I told him about how I've been trying for the past ten years to work on this with him.

I learned to cook, learned instruments he played, listened to his favourite music, got into acting and martial arts because he did it when he was younger, FOR YEARS, I have been trying to have¬†*anything*¬†in common with him.¬†

So I told him all of that, and I said to him ""I don't know what else I can do, so I'm giving you a chance now, I'm telling you that I need you to work on yourself to have a relationship with me, because I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of walking on eggshells around him. I'm tired of hearing you say ""I love you"" to my sister through the wall every night when you've never even said those words to me.""

His response; an eye roll. He just walked away from me.

After he moved out the rest of the family get along with him well and pressure me to see him more often, (currently seeing him monthly).

But things have changed now.

My dad has a girlfriend.

She's 26 years old.

They worked together for the last five years, and, around a month after my dad moved out, he flew overseas to meet her mother. Now... this hasn't been confirmed, but it seems to be pretty extreme to fly¬†overseas¬†to meet the mother of your girlfriend of only a month.

The rest of my family are happy for him. I'm not.

I'm angry that he gets to brush the decade of hurt aside¬†to¬†just¬†restart¬†while I've had years of therapy to try and heal. The rest of my family say I'm holding onto the past. His life is moving on and I should be happy for him.

But I'm not. I don't want him to be able to¬†just¬†move on like that. I want him to know how hurt I am from everything. But he doesn't care. And I don't think he ever will.

So I told him all of that, and I said to him ""I don't know what else I can do, so I'm giving you a chance now, I'm telling you that I need you to work on yourself to have a relationship with me, because I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of walking on eggshells around him. I'm tired of hearing you say ""I love you"" to my sister through the wall every night when you've never even said those words to me.""

His response; an eye roll. He just walked away from me.

After he moved out the rest of the family get along with him well and pressure me to see him more often, (currently seeing him monthly).

But things have changed now.

My dad has a girlfriend.

She's 26 years old.

They worked together for the last five years, and, around a month after my dad moved out, he flew overseas to meet her mother. Now... this hasn't been confirmed, but it seems to be pretty extreme to fly¬†overseas¬†to meet the mother of your girlfriend of only a month.

The rest of my family are happy for him. I'm not.

I'm angry that he gets to brush the decade of hurt aside¬†to¬†just¬†restart¬†while I've had years of therapy to try and heal. The rest of my family say I'm holding onto the past. His life is moving on and I should be happy for him.

But I'm not. I don't want him to be able to¬†just¬†move on like that. I want him to know how hurt I am from everything. But he doesn't care. And I don't think he ever will.

**So, AITA for not wanting my dad to be happy.**",0.0,-0.0012705402914434671,0,1
159,1ci8a80,WIBTA for selling the house my sister lives in?,"I (F30) left home from the town I grew up in at 21, and my older sister (F32) for university at 18. My dad died in a car accident before I was born and mum never remarried. My mum and I were very, very close but mum and my sister had a very bad relationship.

Four years ago, my sister actually moved back to our hometown, got married and has just had her second kid. I am a lesbian and engaged to my future wife, the town is not a great place for queer folk, so it isn't a place we are ever going to live.

Two years ago my mum passed away and the house was put in my name. I offered to let my sister and her family to live there free of charge. They took the offer and bought a house with a mortgage that they are renting out and putting their own payments toward. (they are still a long way off paying it off)

My fiance and I want to buy a house where we currently live, stop renting and start a family.

If I sell the house, we will be able to buy a small house outright and we will not need a mortgage. But that would mean kicking out my sister to sell the property. I tried to very gently bring this topic up and she blew up at, saying that this is unfair, not fair mum gave me the house rather than splitting it, putting her out etc. I will add that I told her this would not be a permanent thing.

They will obviously be put out financially, but this wouldn't happen for another 12 months. They will need to cut back on lifestyle spending, but they won't be struggling.

A few of my family members aside from her are calling me selfish. That I don't have a family to support, I'm just lucky to have been given this house, she got ripped off, I should be more accommodating and think of her kids etc.

161,1ci83y9,AITA for keeping a delivery that wasn't intended for our house?,"Got home from work today to discover a relatively large package/cooler that was clearly marked and packed from a big box gourmet steak/fish/food delivery service. It was addressed to the previous owners of our home, which we have owned for 1 year now. Based on the labeled contents, I figured it was easily worth $200-$300. 

It had the previous owners' phone number on it - so I called them to let them know their package was here and please let us know what to do with it... Left a voicemail explaining the situation. Well a couple hours passed, the cooler continued to sit, so my wife called the big box service - they said something to the effect of ""this is not your problem to solve, so sorry for the inconvenience, we'll make it right with them and replace their box."" And when my wife asked what we should do with the box, they said we should keep it.

So naturally we were sheepishly excited with our unexpected windfall of steaks and fish - unboxed it and filled our freezer. 

Then about an hour later the previous owners called.  I was honest with her about what happened - it was clear she was not thrilled with the outcome. They were expecting the package (I'm not clear how the address mixup happened). She was relatively short with me - when I was explaining that they told us to keep the steaks, and that we'd already unpacked it, she interjected that ""It's mostly fish anyway!"" Anyway, I felt genuinely remorseful for keeping this food that isn't ours, which we didn't pay for -- and I said as much on the call, but OTOH we tried to do the right thing, and it felt weird to offer to repackage everything.

I‚Äôve been independent all my life so I told him I can take myself out or cook  be he just highly disagrees. I just feel like he shouldn‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

167,1ci7kmd,AITA for ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù my roommates alarm clock?,"I (M19) have been living with my roomate (M20) for almost a year now since the start of the 2023 fall semester. Background: we both met at the beginning of 2023 as FWB both looking to move out of our current living situations. Over the summer we became closer as friends and decided we were better off that way after living with each other for sometime. Well since the start of 2024 my roommate Q, has been seeing his new boyfriend Z (M27), and it has caused some issues for us. 

I don‚Äôt mind him seeing other people I myself have been on multiple dates the past year. What I‚Äôm not supportive of is Z. I don‚Äôt know why but even though I never met him I get bad vibes from what Q has told me. From the fact that neither of them have jobs to Z being an alcoholic and the fact that the first weekend the two spent together back in January Q went MIA for over 24 hours and found out 2 days after I last heard from him that Z got so drunk he ended up in the hospital and Q let his phone die and had no way of coming home as Z had been the one driving. 

(Background context on jobs: Q has never had a job before due to extracurriculars in highschool and having an overwhelming course load his past 2 years of college on top of his ADHD. The boyfriend had no desire to go to school due to lack of interest although he is a supposedly amazing chef who wants to go to culinary school.) 

Here‚Äôs where my main issue is. Q is basically never home has he always spends most nights at Z‚Äôs house. But he has this alarm clock that lights up and makes bird chirping sounds whenever it goes off. The problem is he has let it go off multiple times when he is not home and I‚Äôm the one who has to turn it off. I have a crazy schedule as a full time server currently and usually don‚Äôt get home until 11 at night, go to bed by 2 in the morning, and get up around 10 in the morning. My roommate gets up at 7 which means that is when his alarm clock goes off. The first few times I was fine with it but eventually I finally asked him to remember to turn it off before he leaves. That turned into having to ask him multiple times to remember to turn it off but he always forgot. 

Eventually about two weeks back, he left and acknowledged that he was leaving so we both knew that I was aware of being out of the house for the night. Well the next morning his alarm clock went off yet again, and per advice from coworkers and family members, I snapped and just unplugged the clock. I was going to break it because of how tired and annoyed I was but instead I just tossed it on his bed. 

The next night he came home saw the clock and got mad which caused a fight. The next day he told me it was broken and that he didn‚Äôt know how to fix it. I told him that breaking it was never my intention but reminded him that I had asked him multiple times before to turn it off. He got mad and told me that I knew how to turn it off which caused a huge fight.

168,1ci7gwl,AITA for not inviting my parents to my wedding?,"I (32F) recently got engaged to a wonderful man. My parents (60s M/F) have been divorced since I was in elementary school. Their divorce was not pretty. They have only been in the same room once in the last ten years for my college graduation.

Almost immediately after we announced our engagement, parents came to me with separate and outrageous demands.

My dad made it clear he would not attend the wedding if my mother is there. (I lived with my father after the divorce due other issues with my mom, so I am closer to my dad.) Not the biggest problem, but he also said he wouldn't be contributing even though he is very well off. I told him it was unfair to say both ""it's your wedding, do what you want,"" and that he will not attend if my mother is there. He hasn't returned my calls since.

My mom demanded that we use a religious officiant of her choosing, and if I didn't, she would be left out. My mom and I practice different religions, and she, again, did not raise me after the divorce. The difference between our religions is substantial--not different denominations of Christianity or something. When I repeatedly said no to her religious ceremony, she said that I was not committed enough in my beliefs and it hurts her to exclude her at my wedding, while implying she would not attend a religious ceremony of my choosing.

I told my mom she doesn't have to be in my life or attend the wedding and blocked her.

Although my mother has solved my dad's problem, I don't want to allow my dad to enjoy the windfall of my mother's toxic demands either. He needs to give me a sincere apology, but he is refusing to talk to me. 

So now, neither of them are invited.

I gave him almost half my room bc I felt sorry his family kicked him out and thought about how hurt he must have been.

3 months later, he starts getting entitled to the room.

170,1ci76lo,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to pretend to be interested in things I like?," I'd like to preface this by saying that I adore my bf and don't mean anything negative with this post. I(16F) have a bf (18M), and he's been everything I could ask for in a partner. However, tonight he and I got into an argument after he acted dry about something I was excited about. My younger brother(14M) is currently working on a Minecraft mod, and in my discord server posted some screenshots of his progress thus far. When I tried to show the screenshots to my bf and explain how proud I was of my little brother, he responded dryly.

To get more of a reaction out of him, I tried saying things such as ""He's only 14 look how good these models look! I can't believe he only started it this week!"" Despite my efforts, he ended up saying it's only a ""4/10, maybe 7/10"" and that he'd ""be more impressed once there's more progress"". This upset me and I and tried to explain it hurts that he's not even at least trying to be interested, which he responded with saying he just isn't that into it. After, he and I argued a bit where I attempted to make my point that I just really wished he'd at least pretend to be interested in stuff I like. He said that he's going to say if he's not into something. I always try to show interest in things he likes even if it's not something I'm 100% into. An example of this was when the latest FNF week came out and despite the fact I'm not huge on it, I watched him play it and even tried to play it myself. 

He ended up telling me that when I get like this it genuinely upsets him, to which I apologized. I went on to say that the reason it hurt me when he wouldn't even make an attempt to be happy with my brother's project was because for me, showing interest in a partner's things to me is a form of showing that they care. When I show interest in the things he likes even if it's not my cup of tea is showing I care and appreciate him, and want to take the time to make him happy and that I value him. I'd like if he could do the same, even if it's just pretending he's into it. I told him this mainly applies to stuff with my family since they're one of the most important things to me. 

   When he doesn't, it feels like he doesn't care. It's showing to me he doesn't value what I like, which in turn feels like he doesn't like a part of me. I told him with what I like if there's non family-related things that he really can't stand he can tell me about it not being his cup of tea or he can change the subject and we can move on, but I really don't like him not even making an attempt with at least family related things. I understand he and I don't have the best relations with his family but I want him to make an attempt to show he cares about mine since my family is like the extension of me. He seemed confused and said he could try to show more interest in the things I like, but the way he said it didn't seem too enthusiastic.

Hi, I (24M) and my ex (23NB, will use she/her here) were in a really happy relationship for the most part. I want to say that everything was really working well but we had hard time not arguing over things. I sometimes apologized, and she sometimes apologized, and we moved forward and tried out best not to cross that bridge again.

She made me feel like the world was mine and one time was introduced to playing the Yakuza series. It was fun, and I would say I met really cool people through communities and memes. However, this one time was where it kind of struck me the wrong way.

  
In Yakuza 4, there is a character called Saejima. The final moments before the battle, his translated line reads: ""Balls out, Kido!""  
(And of course, for those of you who don't know what that means, it's more in the lines of ""Don't look back and press on"")

And we joke about that line a lot cause it's funny to us. Yes, as weird as that sounds.

  
But whenever I pronounciate the name, I tried to articulate as much as possible but still have hard time splitting Ki and Do, so she would always commentate saying that I said it like a ""kiddo"".

If it would have stopped there, I would have laughed and be like ""I'm trying to say Ki-Do"". But she didn't. She added on saying ""That kinda sounds like a p\*do"" and I was like uhhhhh.



I tried explaining to her, that even if she meant it as a joke, that wasn't okay to say. I said this specifically because I felt like that was very unfiltered and simply not correct. I did tell her that I understand she didn't mean it in an accusing way, but I simply was just upset at the saying.

But she went on and on, making herself believe that I'm trying to be defensive about something. I told her I am not. I wanted to tell her numerous times that I did not like what she said even for a joke. Then, somewhere along the lines of back and forth, she apologizes and starts bursting in tears, saying how she had an ex who was a predator before and all. I tried to comfort her as much as possible and told her it's okay (though it really isn't, I was hurt at the time, but looking back now, being hurt would be incorrect from me). 

With many of the incidents being the true dealbreaker after so long, this is one of the incidents I wish to be judged upon.

173,1ci6xvb,WIBTA for leaving my job and leaving my boss alone after only a few months of working?,"For context- I work as an assistant supervisor for an after school program. Prior to my promotion to this position, I was previously a group leader for the same program but at a different school site. When I was a group leader, I was working hands-on with the kids, supervising their after school activities and I loved it. The staff were awesome, friendly and accepting. I loved my assistant supervisor and head supervisor there. It was really hard emotionally for me to leave when I promoted to the position I‚Äôm in now.

I went from being a group leader there to an assistant supervisor of the program at another school. I thought I would really enjoy the job, it meant more pay and benefits, and I would gain more experience in working with families.

But I'm slowly starting to hate the position. I am not a fan of having to stay at my desk in the main building that we work out of. Most days I‚Äôm just sitting there and calling over our walkie talkie for each of our 100+ kids to go home, or unfolding behavioral issues and student conflicts. I was much more active when I was at my old site since I was outside with them all the time, I was up and moving around while guiding them through activities. And now, I'm at my desk my whole shift and I'm inside all day. I've noticed I'm more depressed, less eager to work, not to mention I don't feel entirely accepted at my site. The staff are far friendlier to the head supervisor, I feel ostracized. I've been working there for 3 months now. The people aren't as friendly, and I feel a significant lack of happiness compared to how I was at my old site in my lower position. The kids are worse in terms of behavioral issues, and I don't feel as connected to them. I‚Äôve had so many days where I come home emotionally drained and I don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to do anything besides eat/sleep.

I plan on staying at least through the summer, because I know I'm needed for those three months. (We are open all day, 7-5, 5 days a week with 2 field trips/week for our summer program). Here‚Äôs the kicker: By demoting, I would want to go back to my old site and if that were not possible, I'd quit altogether. Our after school program is severely understaffed across all sites and my position most likely would not be filled.

Prior to me being there, My head supervisor had to run the program on her own from August-February (which is when I started) and she was working split shifts that entire time (6:30-8:30 in the mornings, then 12-6 in the afternoons).

If I were to demote or quit, I would essentially be depriving her of an assistant supervisor again. (There were 2 before me- one moved to another site, the other quit). I feel like I would be pulling the rug out from under her because I‚Äôm disappointed in the job. However, I feel like my mental health and happiness are being jeopardized.

Would I be the asshole for leaving my job and boss to run it herself?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-02,"WIBTA for leaving my job and leaving my boss alone after only a few months of working? For context- I work as an assistant supervisor for an after school program. Prior to my promotion to this position, I was previously a group leader for the same program but at a different school site. When I was a group leader, I was working hands-on with the kids, supervising their after school activities and I loved it. The staff were awesome, friendly and accepting. I loved my assistant supervisor and head supervisor there. It was really hard emotionally for me to leave when I promoted to the position I‚Äôm in now.

I went from being a group leader there to an assistant supervisor of the program at another school. I thought I would really enjoy the job, it meant more pay and benefits, and I would gain more experience in working with families.

But I'm slowly starting to hate the position. I am not a fan of having to stay at my desk in the main building that we work out of. Most days I‚Äôm just sitting there and calling over our walkie talkie for each of our 100+ kids to go home, or unfolding behavioral issues and student conflicts. I was much more active when I was at my old site since I was outside with them all the time, I was up and moving around while guiding them through activities. And now, I'm at my desk my whole shift and I'm inside all day. I've noticed I'm more depressed, less eager to work, not to mention I don't feel entirely accepted at my site. The staff are far friendlier to the head supervisor, I feel ostracized. I've been working there for 3 months now. The people aren't as friendly, and I feel a significant lack of happiness compared to how I was at my old site in my lower position. The kids are worse in terms of behavioral issues, and I don't feel as connected to them. I‚Äôve had so many days where I come home emotionally drained and I don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to do anything besides eat/sleep.

174,1ci6wbw,AITA for refusing to do School Plays,"I am a Technical Director, handling Lights, Sound, SfX, and Props work in theater. I started a BFA two years ago (volunteered with them a couple years before), and when I began, I worked every show, usually as the TD or ATD.

Now, I'm not the typical student in this program. I'm leagues ahead of the others in the program, I have done this work before and am really good at running tech and so on most shows I got put as the TD or ATD under the program director (who is amazing). The issue comes into play with the Stage Manager (SM). Because this is a small program and no student has expressed interest in the job, the SM is always the same woman. An alum of the program she claims to have worked in this field professionally, but I've been told that, in fact, she has only ever worked a changeover.

So, I come in and run my technical team. I'm big on stay in your lane and the chain of command. The director doesn't talk to my techs; they talk to me. You do your job and dont worry about anything else kind of stuff. The techs under me usually are at first intermediate by this approach but by the project debrief find it to be a empowering way to work because they are given wide freedom in a very narrow band.

¬†Now I'm being told by some others in the theater department that they don't think it's right that I am refusing to support the program and that it sets a bad example for the other students that I am not doing the program's shows anymore.

I genuinely cant tell if im trying to change his character or change some of his habits. I feel like im trying to be a good girlfriend and look out for him. For example of the smaller things ive suggested for him to do; 

I noticed during dinner time when he makes his plate he skips out on his vegetables or he dosent put a proper proportion on his plate. So I tell him to put more.

When he goes for a walk at night to clear his mind, i tell him to wear a hoodie or jacket thats light in color so it can be spotted by cars, instead of a plain black one.

I told him to stop drinking so many monsters because they are really unhealthy for him, and he has had problems with his heart in the past. The lower half of his body has terrible circulation, his legs and feet are practically purple. Hes a smoker as well. hes had exposure to different drugs in his childhood and literally flat lined in the back of an EMS from an overdose when he was younger. CHF literally runs in his family.

I love him, I do. I really care for him and about him. I could see that maybe instead of telling i should instead suggest, but i thought i was doing ‚Äòmy duty‚Äô of being a good girlfriend. I dont THINK im trying to change him or his personality.

Today he said im not letting him think for himself and not letting him have an opinion when i told him to wear something light colored for his walk in the dark. He said he was this way even towards his mom. I feel like hes making it hard for me to love him and look out for him. 

I dont want to change him, i just want to be with him for longer and have as much time as i can get. Am i going about this wrong? AITA?

edit: Thank you all for your opinions and perspectives it has helped me greatly. I truly did not realize how big of a red flag my actions were. I was very misguided. So far from your suggestions ive started researching and have found something called intentional dating. 

It is honestly a weight off my shoulders knowing i dont have to look out for him that way, as you all have reminded me that he IS an adult. This is not a deal breaker for me, so ill ride out this relationship. Its very hard me in general to look at things from a different perspective and i am blessed to have had reddit at my disposal.

He said that he didn't want to have to rely on me cooking all the time and wanted to help me out for a change. I thought this was really sweet.

Well, his gesture is but his food isn't that good in the nicest way possible. I wasn't expecting it to be great because he had no prior history of cooking so I just did my best to hide it. He didn't want me to help him and wanted to do everything by himself.

He's been cooking for about 2 times a week for 3 weeks now. When ever he prepares for us I always tried my best to be supportive and encourage him. I wanted to give him some critiques, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings as he always prepared it with a smile. 

His food is always overseasoned, or overcooked. He doesn't seem to mind and was eating as is. Last week it made me nauseous and I had to stop eating.

 But yesterday, he tried to cook steaks and they didn't turn out right, At ALL. I couldn't lie to him anymore and he couldn't lie to himself either. It was practically chalk. I'm going to cut to the chase and say he was upset once I told him that I was lying about liking his cooking. I told him that I didn't want to hurt his feelings and he got mad at me for saying that. 

He said I should have told him sooner because he didn't feel good knowing that I was eating something I didn't like. Even thought he was  pretending to like his own food but told me it was different with him. I felt that he was being hypocritical but he insist that he wasn't.

 But yesterday, he tried to cook steaks and they didn't turn out right, At ALL. I couldn't lie to him anymore and he couldn't lie to himself either. It was practically chalk. I'm going to cut to the chase and say he was upset once I told him that I was lying about liking his cooking. I told him that I didn't want to hurt his feelings and he got mad at me for saying that. 

He said I should have told him sooner because he didn't feel good knowing that I was eating something I didn't like. Even thought he was  pretending to like his own food but told me it was different with him. I felt that he was being hypocritical but he insist that he wasn't. 

 I offered to help him cook again but he told me that it'll be pointless and he's gonna find something else to cook for me by himself as he doesn't want anyhelp but now he can't trust me to be honest with him. It hurt my feelings when he said that as It wasn't my intention on being dishonest. ",1.0,1.0130503177642822,1,1
180,1ci6ent,AITA for not making enough food to include my mom for meals?,"As an early 30s F, I have lots of aunts and cousins who have shared their cooking advice with me. My mom has always been the biggest, loudest ""be awed and amazed and look at it"" type of cook.

Growing up, she was always making something in the kitchen for some reason--funeral, birthday, baby shower, someone sick, church functions, etc. She still does.

Since she hasn't slowed down, I sometimes cook dinner. I've been cooking for myself and others since I was 15 and except for experiments, I consider myself an ok cook. But for her, its always the same. There's always something wrong with it: too bland, too salty, wrong seasoning, not enough meat, too much meat, why are you using those vegs instead of the one I like, it's not colorful enough, and her current favorite phrase ""why don't you cook like me?"" or ""you didn't get your cooking skills from me cause my stuff doesn't taste/look like that"".

It's gotten to a certain point, she'd rather go out than eat my food. Red beans and rice? Burger King. Spaghetti and salad? Popeye's.  Fried chicken, green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy? Catfish plate. It's like my food is poisonous.....

And even if I follow her recipe or suggestions, it's still wrong. A backhanded compliment is still an insult. So instead of making enough for everyone and extra portions for lunch, I make only enough for me and my 2 kids. Truthfully, I don't think she's even noticed I do it. She mainly complains if I don't cook, which makes the point moot if she doesn't eat it.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-02,"AITA for not making enough food to include my mom for meals?
