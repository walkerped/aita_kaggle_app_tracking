0,1cjear7,"AITA for making my daughter watch ""kids TV""?
","My husband (38M) and I (38F) have 2 kids, our daughter Joelle (16F) and our son Blaine (13M).  
  
On Saturday, Blaine had his friends over, this is fairly normal. Blaine‚Äôs friends come to our house fairly often, most of his friends are from his baseball team. One of the boys in his fiend group isn‚Äôt on the team, but is autistic and his special interest is sports, this boy is also transgender.  
  
Blaine and the other boys are very protective of this friend. We live in a conservative area in the Midwest and it‚Äôs not easy being a transgender autistic teen here. Blaine has spoken to us about how all he wants is for his friend to be happy.  
  
The boy is a very smart kid and is absolutely a positive influence on our son and his other friends. Sometimes his response to the stresses of life is age regressing. He likes watching kids TV shows and sometimes acts younger than 13.   
  
Apparently, Curious George has been trending on TikTok recently and one of the boys asked if they could watch Curious George together, they all agreed and asked the aforementioned autistic boy which episodes to watch, as he still watches the show sometimes.   
  
They were out in the living room watching the show when Joelle came out of her room for a snack, she asked the boys why they were watching it and told them to stop acting like babies, this started an argument and in it, she called the autistic friend an r word. This is when the boys started to scream at her and she went into her room to avoid them.  
  
My husband and I were out for lunch just to have some time to ourselves. When we came home, the boys started all talking to us at once and we asked them to calm down and explain what happened. They told us what went down, and were very angry at Joelle. They were calling her a bully, an asshole and other words. My husband and I went to speak in our room to discuss, we told the boys we would punish Joelle and asked the autistic boy if he had any recommendations on how to teach her about his disability, he mentioned an episode of the PBS Kids show Arthur.  
  
After the boys left, we spoke to Joelle, we took away her phone for the argument and put on the Arthur episode on her TV. She was rolling her eyes the whole time when watching it and said she didn‚Äôt want to watch that ‚Äúbaby crap‚Äù and said we were just being too sensitive.  
  
I called my sister for advice, as she‚Äôs a teacher (general ed but she has has autistic students), she told us we shouldn‚Äôt have made her watch the Arthur episode as she‚Äôs 16 and that would only cause more resentment. She said that we should just let our daughter deal with her own views herself and we won‚Äôt change her mind at her age and we‚Äôre only making her more resentful.

My sister Eliza died suddenly in March. She was in an accident, that is all I‚Äôm going to say.  

My family is big on giving back to the community. So for her funeral, in lieu of flowers we asked that people donate to a charity in Eliza‚Äôs honor. She was a huge animal lover, she was involved in animal rights causes like conservation and banning animal testing, and volunteered and fostered pets for adoption.  So the charities we chose were for animal welfare, ex: ASPCA or Best Friends Animal Society.

One of my friends (not Eliza‚Äôs friend) didn‚Äôt think this was good enough. She wanted to donate to another charity for a cause that‚Äôs been in the news a lot lately. Let‚Äôs say, trans rights.  Which is noble and important, but it wasn‚Äôt Eliza. If she had money, it‚Äôs going towards saving endangered orangutans or feeding homeless cats. 

My friend Pat got hissy with me. She said she didn‚Äôt want to waste money on someone who isn‚Äôt going to notice and would rather her paycheck goes to something that will actually make a difference. I told her no because the donations are for Eliza, not her. I‚Äôm not budging on this.  

Of course, Pat took to social media to paint me out as a villain. Our other friends think that I should have made an exception to Pat and let her donate to the other charity. I still said no because it feels gross. Pat donating somewhere else isn‚Äôt about Eliza, it‚Äôs just an excuse for her to virtue signal. 

Anyway, the funeral was a few weeks ago and things are still tense between me and the people I‚Äôm doubting our friendships with.

2,1ciz13l,AITAH for think is stop supporting my brother?,"Hi everyone, firstly I would like to apologize if I write in broken English. I'm not a native speaker u_u I would like to tell you about our context.

Our mom was a teen mom and then she got married to another man. Sadly, she chose to be a wife and didn't finish her studies. She said her husband didn't let her study or work because he's an extremely jealous man! 

20 years ago they had a son, I'll call him S. He didn't have a nice childhood because his parents were so dysfunctional and when he was like 5 y.o he saw his father trying to s**c*d* and guess... Nobody took him to therapy.

Currently, I support my brother with his university expenses (laptop, clothes, bus tickets, student assurance, notebooks, pens and so on), I checked his scores and are terrible, even worse than last semester. Surely he can't understand he can be expelled from the university. 

Our Grandpa talked with him and said this is because he's so stressed at home, do you think this can be a good reason to be a bad student? I provided him with all the ""tools"". His parents didn't save money, even a cent for his studies and I took the responsibility. I just asked for good scores because I don't want him to work and study at the same time, I had to do it and it isn't easy at all. 

Few months ago, I bought 2 tickets for a concert and I ask him for a 4/5 score in the university if he wanted to come with me. I can see this is like an impossible mission for him. I know I'll feel guilty if I don't let him come with me because is an old band and surely this will be the last time in our country. 

I would like to let you know he has always been a bad student and he chose his major. He said he love it and when I talk with him, I ask if he's happy studying it and he say ""yeah!"". I understand if he hates his major he can choose another.

I talked with some friends who have kids and they said my brother deserves to have a ""punishment"" and learn to be more grateful with me.

Now the question is: AITAH for consider stop supporting my brother?

I'm renting a room in a share house with the rules being quiet time is between 11pm and 9am. I just bought a new blender and plan to use it daily, normally around 10am but today I was off and did some meal prep.  

One of my roommates just said something loud woke him.  So maybe I'm overreacting about him complaining.  The other left a message in the group chat about a loud noise waking him and someone else up and how people are being disrespectful.  

However I do think the second roommate might be being petty because someone (I think him) had diarrhea and left shit all over the bathroom.  I left an angry message in the group chat with pictures.  He later responded that someone needed to clean the feces in the bathroom (as if he never saw my message).  However I saw him go towards the area of the bathroom and a few hours later it was cleaned.  It had stayed dirty for several hours.  

Another thing that makes me think it was him and that his comment might be passive aggressive.  This apparently happened before but I wasn't home.  Another roommate that has a drug problem blamed me and they both get along.  She flips out sometimes and he hugs her later telling her it's alright to walk around the house ranting at 2am and leaving weird messages in the group chat.

5,1ciy7m7,AITA for removing one of my friend's sales?,"I could use some outside, unbiased perspective on this.

I would she is my only close friend at the moment, she's always been sweet and looked out for me when I needed it (and sometimes when I didn't). But here comes the issue: since the sales department deals with a lot of sensitive information, including the clients' payment information, it is against our security policies that the sales agents save that information outside of the approved payment processors, but we have some agents that keep saving it in unauthorized Notes apps, sometimes leaving it there for days until they remember to delete it. It has happened very frequently, so our OPS Manager said that if we have someone who continuously makes this same mistake of saving the client's payment information, we should remove a sale from them as a disciplinary action. My friend is one of those that leave the client's card details hanging around for too long.

I have talked to her about it (nine times, to be specific) and I even told her of this new rule our OPS Manager imposed. She told me she wouldn't commit the same mistake again. She was very hopeful because our bosses told her she needed to reach a certain number of sales in April so she could receive a raise. She actually reached the goal they set for her. The thing is that she kept one of the client's credit card details saved in one of those Notes apps, even after our talks about it.

I noticed when I was auditing, and told her about it, and she expected me to keep quiet and not tell anyone that she left the card saved there, but I had to tell our OPS Manager, so I did. I plead with him to let her keep the sale, but he didn't budge, so I had to remove the sale from her. Without that sale, my friend no longer qualified for the raise.

She now won't talk or even look at me. I understand that she is upset and I didn't want this to happen either, but she is making me feel like I broke some kind of friendship rule when I had warned her about this issue numerous times, including what would happen if she did it again, and she knows that if somebody found out that I didn't go through the established process and applied the necessary disciplinary actions, then the blame for that security breach would fall on me. 

I tried to talk to her about it, but like I said, she won't even look at me.

I (23f) have a big family. 10 siblings in total. I had a medical issue that disabled me at a young age and I have been trying to work on my personal life and be more independent.

My mother yells at me and calls me names for most of anything as well as my sibling. I have been told that no one cares about me when i need to go to the doctor for my disability.

They do help but it feels like its out of obligation rather than a want or care for my health. They do not want me to drive, yet they make excuses not to take me to the doctor. they also made me stop physical therapy for my weaker side of my body because ""it wasn't working"". I was only going for a few weeks.

I do get ssi for my disability, but that money is taken for the house by my mother who takes the money and give me whats left which is 200.

I will still want to help my family , but I want to start being more independent. but my family (mainly my mother and older brother)  keep telling me how I can't do anything right and call me dumb.

I feel like I am being TA because we are poor and I was told my ssi is used for taking care of the house but I feel like I am the only one putting in to the house that doesn't belong to me or I have any say in how the money is being used.

Eventually my parents and most of my extended family came around to the idea and it has been so long now that most people don‚Äôt even think of her living as anything but a woman. I now have a great friendship with her and she has been a wonderful aunt to my kids. 

My husband (53M) and I have three children (25M), (21M) and (19F). Our oldest son Casey (25M) is gay and has always been very gender non-conforming. He would demand to wear ‚Äúgirls clothes‚Äù from the time he was little and would become very angry if he didn‚Äôt get his way. My husband and I didn‚Äôt have anything against this at home but didn‚Äôt allow him to dress like that in public to avoid bullying. My sister introduced Casey to drag through watching the tv show drag race when he was in high school. He actually started performing in drag a few years ago and now performs a few times a month as a hobby. My husband and I have been very supportive and gone to some of his shows. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem with Casey but because of everything we went through with my sister and how he seems to be becoming more and more feminine (he has grown out his hair and is wearing more feminine clothes even when not performing) I do worry that he is ultimately going to transition. I brought this up to my sister and asked if Casey had spoken to her about it. Somehow this really offended her even though it wasn‚Äôt my intention. She didn‚Äôt like that I was trying to find out the details of conversations they have had privately and that after having her as my sister I‚Äôm still worried about having a trans kid. She said it hurt her feelings to know I would be upset if my child turned out like her.

8,1cixxla,AITA for a situation i am in with my mother.,"i (25f) live on my own and my parents have always been very controlling of me as they were with my two older siblings. last year my father died and since then my mom has become extremely overbearing, especially when it comes to money. she‚Äôs constantly asking for money from me, usually for her bill or shopping trips, sometimes even for things i pay for myself (like gas). every time she asks for money she gets angry if i don‚Äôt give it right away and has started getting very manipulative with it, telling me that ‚Äúif you loved your dad you would‚Äù or asking me to help her out because ‚Äúyour dad always did‚Äù so i can‚Äôt really refuse without feeling like a terrible person. 

this has been going on for the past year and last month when she asked if i could give her $80 for my mom to go shopping with, i told her no and that she needed to pay back some of the money she had borrowed from me over the past few months because she was supposed to have paid it back by then. instead of listening, she got upset and asked if i could give her $10 for gas since she was out of money and her car needed gas. i told her no again but said that i would give her some later that day after work if she still needed it. when i came home from work, she had already left and didn‚Äôt come back until late the next night, telling me to go get groceries for her because she was too tired from working all day. 

i went to bed angry at her manipulation of money since she only works part time and has more than enough money in her bank account (i know this because she showed me how much is in there) so the next morning i told my mom that she needed to pay back the $60 she had borrowed from me over the past year. i didn‚Äôt ask for it, i just gave it back to her and told her that if she wanted money again she needed to pay it back first. this made her extremely angry and she started screaming at me about how she was my mother and how she always helped me out when i was growing up so now i have to do the same for her. she said that even though i don‚Äôt live with her anymore, i still owe her everything because she raised me and without her i wouldn‚Äôt be where i am today. this really hurt me because my mom is a great person but she has always been very controlling and manipulative of us as children so i feel like now she is taking advantage of that to get money from me whenever she wants it. anyway, this all happened last week and i haven‚Äôt spoken to her since then.

10,1cixw72,AITA for telling my MIL that I already have a lot of clothes?,"I (26F) have a 2-year relationship with my partner (30M). Although his family has a totally different political ideology than mine, we are very cordial and they are more like my family than my own family. I have a very very bad relationship with my family, in which they neglected me a lot since I was little and abused me in many ways. Until recently all my clothes were donated although my sisters always had new clothes, I always had donations from other people or I bought used clothes with what I had left over from small jobs that I had while I was studying (I sold candy, or bought things on Aliexpress and resold them on Facebook Marketplace). The issue begins with the fact that a few years ago I started having formal jobs and being able to buy my own clothes, so I lost control and bought a LOT of clothes, and only used a small part of them. Why did I only use a small part? Because I'm autistic, and clothes that seemed pretty to me at first glance ended up making me feel uncomfortable. The point here is that I barely always wear the same 5 t-shirts (Dragon ball, Pusheen, Jaws, Hello Kitty and The Exorcist) and 5 pants (Spongebob, Dragon Ball and no prints). My MIL, aware of my bad relationship with my family, noticed that I always wore the same clothes and the same sneakers (Although I have 3 different pairs, they are all the same model) and she started giving me clothes, a lot of clothes, which at first I didn't understand but soon I connected the dots and the next time she gave me something I told her ""Thank you very much, but I have a lot of clothes, I just don't usually use it."".
She was a little surprised and I noticed that she was upset with me for a few days, although she never expressed it verbally, since then she has not given me clothes again.
A friend says that maybe I shouldn't have told her that, because she did it out of genuine concern, but I don't like the idea of her spending money on me.

12,1cixvmi,AITA for cancelling 2 hours before a date? ,"For context I 20F got asked out on a date by a guy 22M. I met him while I was working since he works at the bank and I have to visit the bank to deposit money. We‚Äôve never really interacted except for the small convos when I visit the bank. One day he walks into my office and asks me out on a date, I said yes and agreed since I did find him cute. 

We end up deciding on Saturday which is the day after he asked me out. He calls me the night before to organise the date and we decide on a nice restaurant in the city that he recommended and he ends up paying a $70PP set meal. During the call I realised I started feeling slightly overwhelmed, I have no experience dating and this will be my first date so I felt like it all happened too fast and I would rather have gotten to know him better before being asked out. Also I realised he isn‚Äôt really my type and I didn‚Äôt feel too strong of a chemistry during the call. However, it‚Äôs already a bit late since he already made the reservation so I decided to just push myself to go and just follow through with it. 

The next day I wake up and have this strong gut feeling that I really don‚Äôt want to go on this date. I just felt like I didn‚Äôt want my first date to be this guy and I know it‚Äôs selfish in this case to prioritise myself since he did already pay for the meal and also the date was scheduled in 3 hours. I ended up following my gut feeling and called to him to cancel the date, I told him honestly I just didn‚Äôt feel like it anymore and apologised multiple times. I also offered to pay my part but he said he‚Äôll find a friend to go with so it‚Äôs fine so I didn‚Äôt end up paying him. Unfortunately I still have to see him every Friday and it‚Äôs slightly awkward despite trying to keep it friendly. Do you guys think he finds me flaky or has like a negative opinion toward me?

16,1cixoea,AITA for talking on the phone with a stranger in front of my wife ? ,"Good evening and thank you for reading.

A little context for this situation. My dad is 70 years old. He is a semi-retired divorced boomer who is currently in vacation in Europe with his girlfriend. When I was 16-17, I was an exchange student in France, this was 16 years ago. I have not spoken french or really used it with anybody or anything ever since (l know my fault).

Today my wife asked me if I could drive her mom to buy some things my mother in law needed for an upcoming trip she is having. 

While driving to the store, my dad calls me, I answered the phone and the call goes to speaker phone since my phone was connected to the car's Bluetooth. He opened the call saying "" hey son, I am with 2 french ladies right now, and I can't pronounce the name of the city you lived"" I told him the name of the city I used to live while I was an exchange student. He the goes ""you tell her, talk to her"" and he puts her on the phone. 

This person says hi to me and I do as well. I don't really recall the conversation since my french is very rusty. I just told her, or at least I tried telling her because it seemed like she didn't really understand, that I lived a year in France and that I haven't spoken with anybody in a long time. I tell her take care of my dad to end the call, she puts my dad on the phone and he then just says "" Hey, you want me to take a picture of them so you can see how pretty they are"" and I just answered ""no, I am not interested"" he then laughs at me and says ""ok bye"" and hangs up. Whe he laughed I noticed he was maybe a little drunk, and judging by the hour he called, it was nighttime in Europe.

When the call ended I tell my wife and mother in law what I had said in French since the didn't understand. This is when I see my wife's face and she is furious. I was seriously confused, and may be I screwed up a little, since out of pure reaction I ask her ""are you angry?"" And she goes ""I don't know"". She went dead silent. We bought the stuff and took her mom back. 

Right away we started arguing, she said I humiliated her, to wich I said I never intended to do that, I was trying to be polite to that woman. She also said ""I knew my father's intent"" to wich I really don't even know what to say. Among other things. We had a pretty bad argument, she is really mad at me and doesn't want to speak to me. I tried talking but she ignored me. I really don't feel I did anything wrong.

Was I an asshole?

He the goes ""you tell her, talk to her"" and he puts her on the phone. 

This person says hi to me and I do as well. I don't really recall the conversation since my french is very rusty. I just told her, or at least I tried telling her because it seemed like she didn't really understand, that I lived a year in France and that I haven't spoken with anybody in a long time. I tell her take care of my dad to end the call, she puts my dad on the phone and he then just says "" Hey, you want me to take a picture of them so you can see how pretty they are"" and I just answered ""no, I am not interested"" he then laughs at me and says ""ok bye"" and hangs up. Whe he laughed I noticed he was maybe a little drunk, and judging by the hour he called, it was nighttime in Europe.

When the call ended I tell my wife and mother in law what I had said in French since the didn't understand. This is when I see my wife's face and she is furious. I was seriously confused, and may be I screwed up a little, since out of pure reaction I ask her ""are you angry?"" And she goes ""I don't know"". She went dead silent. We bought the stuff and took her mom back. 

Right away we started arguing, she said I humiliated her, to wich I said I never intended to do that, I was trying to be polite to that woman. She also said ""I knew my father's intent"" to wich I really don't even know what to say. Among other things. We had a pretty bad argument, she is really mad at me and doesn't want to speak to me. I tried talking but she ignored me. I really don't feel I did anything wrong.

Was I an asshole?

17,1cixfti,AITA Friends with benefits until it wasn't ,"About a year ago, I started hanging out with some friends, and one of them turned out to be a woman who worked at the same company as I do. I was 26, she was 35. We never had any interaction at work, as I'm a production manager and she's an executive level director. 

We do have a number of mutual interests and background.  Mainly cooking, college football, and ethnic background.  On a few occasions, some of us would stay overnight so we did not have to drive after drinking. No big deal, I usually ended up on the couch in her home office. '

This goes on for about 4 months. At no time had I made any moves or flirt. 

We made dinner for a group of people, and afterwards, I offered to help clean up and put everything away. We continue drinking a bit, nothing out of the ordinary, not getting drunk, but feeling fine. We decide to watch some TV and she offers to let me sleep on the couch again. Fine by me. 

I admit, I made the first move, I don't know what I was thinking, as it wasn't planned. She stiffened at first, but didn't say no, move away or gave any indication for me to stop. Things progressed, with both of us getting a little heated. 

She pushes me back, and stares for a few seconds. and says that we need to talk before this goes any further. 

If this was to go forward, I need to understand this was not a beginning of a relationship, but just two people enjoying each other. No one can know, and under no circumstances was this to become romantic.  I agreed, and for the next 5 months or so, see each other 1-2 times per month, and I get reminded that I should not get romantically involved. I accept this as fact, and still date people in my own age group. 

You can guess what happens next, she's tells me she's in love with me. It's been so ingrained in my head that the first thing that blurts out of my mouth is ""Well, I don't love you"". I tried to walk it back and explain why, but it was no use. I was told to leave and I did.  I called, texted, and never got another reply.  She resigned and moved out of state to where her parents live. 

A few weeks go by and one of her friends asks to meet me after week and I agree.  I was told I ruined her life, career and caused world hunger. I was the self centered asshole. 

Really, am I the asshole?

Fast forward to us getting married and my in laws have really showed their true colours, literally on the day off. They were extremely demanding and entitled to the extent that my mil tried to force me to leave one of my wedding events right before it was meant to start to pick her up, with absolutely no warning (I could have organised a driver for her if she let me know beforehand).

I asked again and he eventually responded with yea. His attitude and behavior towards me has also been very hostile when I ask work related questions, so I can do my job such as payroll, I‚Äôm met with attitude or he just ignores me and walks away.  So today I‚Äôm trying to leave again and ask if he‚Äôs going to lock up and as usual he walks away.  I‚Äôve had it. I ask what his issue is with me and if he even has permission to be hanging out after hours. As expected he turns it around on me and says ‚Äúdo you want me to have a problem with you‚Äù 
I told him I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing something that could get me in trouble and he says I‚Äôm not his boss.
Cool, so I text the boss and ask he he‚Äôs allowed to be hanging out after I leave for the day. He says no.
I tell my coworker this and he just starts yelling leave me alone. And what did I do to you ?! 
So this guy is over 6ft and easily 230 + 
I‚Äôm 5.2, 120 after I eat a heavy meal. 
I‚Äôve never been scared of this guy but at this point I just leave. 


Why did I never ask the boss before ? Previously I had assumed he made an arrangement and this was all okay. Many of us are aware of his situation and many people have offered him a place to stay. 
But staying at the office ‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs an office suite we lease. He has a key because his job requires him to have one. But for obvious reasons people can‚Äôt just stay there which before I didn‚Äôt think that was happening but now I‚Äôm not so sure. 


Now I just feel bad about the whole thing.

",TL;DR,2024-05-03,"AITA I may have gotten a homeless coworker fired or in trouble (not sure which yet) My coworker is in a tough situation.

This has worked out for the past month and a half. I agreed to try this out.

The last time we were both at my parents‚Äô place, and as we were leaving, I mentioned that we would be coming again in three weeks. Over the past few weeks, when I spoke to them I mentioned that we would be coming on Saturday.

The problem started this past week when his dad caught a cold. We decided that it would be best if we stayed home. Our washing machine was broken, so we took care of that. I had a brief conversation with my mom and she asked us if we wanted to come over that day, but I decided not to because it was such short notice.

I was not aware of this change in plan until today. My husband says that he added it to the shared calendar so I should have known but unfortunately I did not see it.

When we had the conversation today, I thought that it was unfair to change plans after making them. Especially since it was based on a schedule he had decided on. He thinks I‚Äôm being ridiculous because obviously there was a special circumstance that has caused the scheduled rotation to change.

2. Before we set this schedule, my husband didn‚Äôt always make plans in time to see his parents every other week so sometimes it wasn‚Äôt three weeks before we saw them
3. my brother/parents are busy the next couple of Saturdays so if we don‚Äôt go this Saturday, we won‚Äôt see them until Mother‚Äôs Day.

29,1civq6b,AITA for getting an Uber driver fired?,"Throwaway.

The other day, I (M 30) called an Uber to pick me up from work to take me to my weekly trivia game. I don't drive due to a medical condition.

The driver they assigned me refused to pick me up. And he refused to cancel the ride. ""You can do it,"" he kept saying over and over. After several back and forths of me telling him ""No, you cancel it"" if he didn't want to pick me up, he left me on read. I suspected he wouldn't cancel it himself because he thought he'd still get some kind of compensation due to the cancellation fee, so I gave him one more chance and told him, ""If you don't cancel it, I'll be calling Uber right after I do."" Again, he left me on read.

I was already running late at this point, so true to my word, I cancelled the ride, got another ride through Lyft, and used Uber's help feature to explain the situation and report this guy so as not to be charged the cancellation fee. The person they had me texting with said it would be taken care of. I thought that was the end of it.

--until yesterday, when the guy showed up at the school! (I guess he screenshot the ride or wrote down the address before I canceled, I don't know.) He confronted me in the parking lot as I'm walking to that day's Uber because Uber deactivated his account, pending an official review. This dude was IRATE. Another teacher had to come and break it up. He got in his car and drove off.

Because it was so noticeable what happened, today, it got around school to the staff and even some students the basics of what happened. Some of my co-workers are saying I shouldn't have reported him, that potentially costing this man his job was not worth the $35 refund. I don't think I did anything wrong.

For this particular work, I have to set up a team of creatives to work on it. My friends are all very talented but I want to choose the directive that is closest to my creative vision. They all got surprised when I told them that I want them to actually pitch for the position instead of me just accepting them cause they're my friends, one of the in particular got super angry and made a drama, even saying things like ""I'll make it easy for you and won't even apply so it's easier for you to decide"". I feel like they're guilt tripping me into choosing them cause they feel bad. Or am I being way too harsh and taking it way too seriously?  ",0.0,0.015008355,0,1
34,1civ3yb,AITA for making a complaint? ,"So I work in an office and have had to make a few complaints lately. Basically where I work its in an office, a credit union.



I had an issue with a specific employee who would chew up office equipment, pens, ect or put that stuff to their body like pick their scabs or something with it just nasty stuff. I had tried to be really cool and not complain but we share offices and I have to use all that stuff when they are done with it and its nasty. I addressed it directly to this employee and they just laughed it off. and then keeps doing it. I keep going into an office and stuff will be dirty or chewed up and gross and I have to throw this stuff away wash my hands get new stuff. So I got upset about it and decided to send an email. I emailed the employee:



""Please stop chewing on the pens, I have had to throw away a bunch of them. It's nasty when they are put back into the pen cup for members(customers) and other employees to use. Buy some Gum or something. Thank you.""



and CC'd the manager to make sure it was addressed. Wasn't trying to be a dick or rude but it keeps happening and its gross to deal with. We are not in middle school and I have tried asking her nicely a few times to stop with no luck. Well today I get pulled aside saying my email COULD be viewed as rude. And that its being reviewed by my managers manager, her manager and HR. Basically saying I am about to be written up over making a complaint via email. My manager admitted when I said it verbally it didnt sound as bad, and also if I sent it only to the manager it wouldn't have been an issue. Well pretty much every time I fucked up doing something other departments or employees email me directly and CC my manager. Its the go to format for making a complaint or bringing attention to a situation that needs to be addressed. I even talked to the employee chewing the pens if she thought the email was rude or offensive and she said no. She only cared I involved management and didnt talk to her directly (which i tried before.) So now I am about to get a write up over something that MIGHT be considered rude or COULD be considered rude according to the manager. But wasnt rude when pretty much said the same thing in person. The directed employee doesnt think its rude, and I was trying to say please and thank you to crube any unintended meaning in the message.



Was I wrong to even bring it up? Am I in the wrong for making a complaint? Or does it feel like I am being retaliated against for making the complaint at all? I feel like I am being retaliated against. I have had to make other complaints about people not doing their job right forcing me to pick up their slack right before this too and I feel like they are punishing me for bringing this stuff up.

35,1civ2av,AITA for wishing my friend never met her boyfriend?,"I (25F) share an apartment with my best friend (26F) who has been in a relationship for the past 2 years with her boyfriend (39M). They have one of those subtly patriarchal relationships where she does most of their chores and he, well, I‚Äôm not sure as to what he does but they are both okay with it. She says he makes her happy and she loves doing things for him.

Any how, until a year ago our living situation did not allow guests so whenever she wanted to spend time with him, she went to his place. Now that her and I have moved to a new place, he is over all the time and I have to like a guest in my own house. 

Tbh I never liked him so I never tried to talk to him before he started coming over to our place. He is one of those people who just have to be right all the time. Most of the time I ignore his snarky remarks about my erratic sleep schedule or the shows I watch or the people I talk to or my eating habbits or how I should live a better life, because I have better things to do. (My friend and I are junior residents and have very hectic schedules so I like to sleep and relax in the little time I get for myself, alone. Honestly, if I wanted someone to taunt me at every little thing I do, I‚Äôd go live with my mother. He works freelance and therfore has the liberty of having a fixed schedule. I‚Äôd love that for myself but I practically live in the hospital.)

I have tried talking to her about it. It stops for a while, then it starts again. I do not understand his pathological need to control everyone around him irrespective of whether he understands their situation. She might be okay with it but I am not. 

I have also talked about her moving in with him and me finding a new roommate but she refuses to because he is planning on selling everything and going on a trip for a year in a few months. 

I wish she‚Äôd never met him or she‚Äôd atleast acknowledge my problem. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-03,"AITA for wishing my friend never met her boyfriend?

36,1civ18b,AITA for telling my friend my test score knowing it would probably upset her,"i (19f) and my best friend (20f) are taking the same course at our university. We recently had a pretty big test and we were both anxious to see our scores. Once they were released she called me asking how i did, so I checked my score and was met with some disappointment. I spent hours studying and was confident I could get an A, and was hoping I would as it would boost my in the course which i really needed. So when i saw i got a 80 on the exam i was decently upset, and immediately texted my friend and told her i did bad. I know and 80 is not a bad score but i had set a higher goal for myself and worked hard to achieve it, so my immediate reaction was that i did bad. When she pried more i told her i didn‚Äôt want to share my score, since she‚Äôs gotten upset in the past by comparing our grades. However, she seemed annoyed that i wouldn‚Äôt tell her and called me ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and so i caved and gave her my score. At this point ive come to terms with my score and was no longer very upset, after all it is still a good grade and wont hurt me. But after she got me score just got upset and said she was ‚Äúdisappointed i lie about my grades‚Äù. I told her i wasn‚Äôt lying about my score and i only said it was bad because i studied a lot and had set a goal for myself that i failed to reach.

37,1ciutgy,"AITA for defending my ""selfish"" uncle?","I (36f) was at a cousin's wedding. 

Background: there are two autism cases in the family, my sister (who passed away a year ago) with high needs nonverbal autism, and my cousin  (moms older brothers son) who is more independent and verbal but let's just say he's on a first name basis with the cops. He has a younger NT brother who's been pretty trau matized from the whole experience, as have I and my youngest NT sister. We are the only cousins who are unmarried without kids (not that there's anything wrong with this, but I come from a traditional family where it's not considered ""normal""). 

Then my other aunt (moms sister) had 3 daughters, their father was a narcissist and they divorced while they were better adjusted than us and my other cousin they still had issues as a result. Two are married with kids the other just got married 

Then there's my mom's younger brother who has a good marriage with his wife, 3 NT children, neither of the parents are narcissistic. All three ended up married with kids and good jobs and seem very happy and well adjusted. 

My mother and aunt(my marriage, older brothers wife) have bonded over their children with disabilities, and both are in serious denial on how much of an impact it's had in their NT kids, but I can tell their both hurt at having no weddings or grandkids. I heard them gossiping about my younger uncle, that he's  ""selfish"" (he's only mildly so, like grabbing the largest slice of pizza at a super bowl party petty stuff, nothing too extreme, id still take him over my parents any day), I think they are bitterly jealous because his kids turned out much more well adjusted with no major issues (I'm not saying being single with no kids is an issue, but they've been the only one who've ended up without mental health problems). 

I said to them ""say what you want about him but his kids are the most well adjusted of anyone's in the families"" and they said I was ""cruel"" and  I ""have no idea how hard it is to raise a disabled child, he had no disabled kids"" I said ""that may well be but it just goes to show you how much the environment a child grows up in makes a difference in how they turn out as much as you two want to pretend it has no impact whatsoever"" 

My dad says I need to apologize to my mom, I don't feel I have anything to apologize for I spoke the truth.
