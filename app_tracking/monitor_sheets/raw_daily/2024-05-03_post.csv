0,1cjear7,"AITA for making my daughter watch ""kids TV""?
","My husband (38M) and I (38F) have 2 kids, our daughter Joelle (16F) and our son Blaine (13M).  
  
On Saturday, Blaine had his friends over, this is fairly normal. Blaine‚Äôs friends come to our house fairly often, most of his friends are from his baseball team. One of the boys in his fiend group isn‚Äôt on the team, but is autistic and his special interest is sports, this boy is also transgender.  
  
Blaine and the other boys are very protective of this friend. We live in a conservative area in the Midwest and it‚Äôs not easy being a transgender autistic teen here. Blaine has spoken to us about how all he wants is for his friend to be happy.  
  
The boy is a very smart kid and is absolutely a positive influence on our son and his other friends. Sometimes his response to the stresses of life is age regressing. He likes watching kids TV shows and sometimes acts younger than 13.   
  
Apparently, Curious George has been trending on TikTok recently and one of the boys asked if they could watch Curious George together, they all agreed and asked the aforementioned autistic boy which episodes to watch, as he still watches the show sometimes.   
  
They were out in the living room watching the show when Joelle came out of her room for a snack, she asked the boys why they were watching it and told them to stop acting like babies, this started an argument and in it, she called the autistic friend an r word. This is when the boys started to scream at her and she went into her room to avoid them.  
  
My husband and I were out for lunch just to have some time to ourselves. When we came home, the boys started all talking to us at once and we asked them to calm down and explain what happened. They told us what went down, and were very angry at Joelle. They were calling her a bully, an asshole and other words. My husband and I went to speak in our room to discuss, we told the boys we would punish Joelle and asked the autistic boy if he had any recommendations on how to teach her about his disability, he mentioned an episode of the PBS Kids show Arthur.  
  
After the boys left, we spoke to Joelle, we took away her phone for the argument and put on the Arthur episode on her TV. She was rolling her eyes the whole time when watching it and said she didn‚Äôt want to watch that ‚Äúbaby crap‚Äù and said we were just being too sensitive.  
  
I called my sister for advice, as she‚Äôs a teacher (general ed but she has has autistic students), she told us we shouldn‚Äôt have made her watch the Arthur episode as she‚Äôs 16 and that would only cause more resentment. She said that we should just let our daughter deal with her own views herself and we won‚Äôt change her mind at her age and we‚Äôre only making her more resentful.

My sister Eliza died suddenly in March. She was in an accident, that is all I‚Äôm going to say.  

My family is big on giving back to the community. So for her funeral, in lieu of flowers we asked that people donate to a charity in Eliza‚Äôs honor. She was a huge animal lover, she was involved in animal rights causes like conservation and banning animal testing, and volunteered and fostered pets for adoption.  So the charities we chose were for animal welfare, ex: ASPCA or Best Friends Animal Society.

One of my friends (not Eliza‚Äôs friend) didn‚Äôt think this was good enough. She wanted to donate to another charity for a cause that‚Äôs been in the news a lot lately. Let‚Äôs say, trans rights.  Which is noble and important, but it wasn‚Äôt Eliza. If she had money, it‚Äôs going towards saving endangered orangutans or feeding homeless cats. 

My friend Pat got hissy with me. She said she didn‚Äôt want to waste money on someone who isn‚Äôt going to notice and would rather her paycheck goes to something that will actually make a difference. I told her no because the donations are for Eliza, not her. I‚Äôm not budging on this.  

Of course, Pat took to social media to paint me out as a villain. Our other friends think that I should have made an exception to Pat and let her donate to the other charity. I still said no because it feels gross. Pat donating somewhere else isn‚Äôt about Eliza, it‚Äôs just an excuse for her to virtue signal. 

Anyway, the funeral was a few weeks ago and things are still tense between me and the people I‚Äôm doubting our friendships with.

2,1ciz13l,AITAH for think is stop supporting my brother?,"Hi everyone, firstly I would like to apologize if I write in broken English. I'm not a native speaker u_u I would like to tell you about our context.

Our mom was a teen mom and then she got married to another man. Sadly, she chose to be a wife and didn't finish her studies. She said her husband didn't let her study or work because he's an extremely jealous man! 

20 years ago they had a son, I'll call him S. He didn't have a nice childhood because his parents were so dysfunctional and when he was like 5 y.o he saw his father trying to s**c*d* and guess... Nobody took him to therapy.

Currently, I support my brother with his university expenses (laptop, clothes, bus tickets, student assurance, notebooks, pens and so on), I checked his scores and are terrible, even worse than last semester. Surely he can't understand he can be expelled from the university. 

Our Grandpa talked with him and said this is because he's so stressed at home, do you think this can be a good reason to be a bad student? I provided him with all the ""tools"". His parents didn't save money, even a cent for his studies and I took the responsibility. I just asked for good scores because I don't want him to work and study at the same time, I had to do it and it isn't easy at all. 

Few months ago, I bought 2 tickets for a concert and I ask him for a 4/5 score in the university if he wanted to come with me. I can see this is like an impossible mission for him. I know I'll feel guilty if I don't let him come with me because is an old band and surely this will be the last time in our country. 

I would like to let you know he has always been a bad student and he chose his major. He said he love it and when I talk with him, I ask if he's happy studying it and he say ""yeah!"". I understand if he hates his major he can choose another.

I talked with some friends who have kids and they said my brother deserves to have a ""punishment"" and learn to be more grateful with me.

Now the question is: AITAH for consider stop supporting my brother?

I'm renting a room in a share house with the rules being quiet time is between 11pm and 9am. I just bought a new blender and plan to use it daily, normally around 10am but today I was off and did some meal prep.  

One of my roommates just said something loud woke him.  So maybe I'm overreacting about him complaining.  The other left a message in the group chat about a loud noise waking him and someone else up and how people are being disrespectful.  

However I do think the second roommate might be being petty because someone (I think him) had diarrhea and left shit all over the bathroom.  I left an angry message in the group chat with pictures.  He later responded that someone needed to clean the feces in the bathroom (as if he never saw my message).  However I saw him go towards the area of the bathroom and a few hours later it was cleaned.  It had stayed dirty for several hours.  

Another thing that makes me think it was him and that his comment might be passive aggressive.  This apparently happened before but I wasn't home.  Another roommate that has a drug problem blamed me and they both get along.  She flips out sometimes and he hugs her later telling her it's alright to walk around the house ranting at 2am and leaving weird messages in the group chat.

5,1ciy7m7,AITA for removing one of my friend's sales?,"I could use some outside, unbiased perspective on this.

I would she is my only close friend at the moment, she's always been sweet and looked out for me when I needed it (and sometimes when I didn't). But here comes the issue: since the sales department deals with a lot of sensitive information, including the clients' payment information, it is against our security policies that the sales agents save that information outside of the approved payment processors, but we have some agents that keep saving it in unauthorized Notes apps, sometimes leaving it there for days until they remember to delete it. It has happened very frequently, so our OPS Manager said that if we have someone who continuously makes this same mistake of saving the client's payment information, we should remove a sale from them as a disciplinary action. My friend is one of those that leave the client's card details hanging around for too long.

I have talked to her about it (nine times, to be specific) and I even told her of this new rule our OPS Manager imposed. She told me she wouldn't commit the same mistake again. She was very hopeful because our bosses told her she needed to reach a certain number of sales in April so she could receive a raise. She actually reached the goal they set for her. The thing is that she kept one of the client's credit card details saved in one of those Notes apps, even after our talks about it.

I noticed when I was auditing, and told her about it, and she expected me to keep quiet and not tell anyone that she left the card saved there, but I had to tell our OPS Manager, so I did. I plead with him to let her keep the sale, but he didn't budge, so I had to remove the sale from her. Without that sale, my friend no longer qualified for the raise.

She now won't talk or even look at me. I understand that she is upset and I didn't want this to happen either, but she is making me feel like I broke some kind of friendship rule when I had warned her about this issue numerous times, including what would happen if she did it again, and she knows that if somebody found out that I didn't go through the established process and applied the necessary disciplinary actions, then the blame for that security breach would fall on me. 

I tried to talk to her about it, but like I said, she won't even look at me.

I (23f) have a big family. 10 siblings in total. I had a medical issue that disabled me at a young age and I have been trying to work on my personal life and be more independent.

My mother yells at me and calls me names for most of anything as well as my sibling. I have been told that no one cares about me when i need to go to the doctor for my disability.

They do help but it feels like its out of obligation rather than a want or care for my health. They do not want me to drive, yet they make excuses not to take me to the doctor. they also made me stop physical therapy for my weaker side of my body because ""it wasn't working"". I was only going for a few weeks.

I do get ssi for my disability, but that money is taken for the house by my mother who takes the money and give me whats left which is 200.

I will still want to help my family , but I want to start being more independent. but my family (mainly my mother and older brother)  keep telling me how I can't do anything right and call me dumb.

I feel like I am being TA because we are poor and I was told my ssi is used for taking care of the house but I feel like I am the only one putting in to the house that doesn't belong to me or I have any say in how the money is being used.

Eventually my parents and most of my extended family came around to the idea and it has been so long now that most people don‚Äôt even think of her living as anything but a woman. I now have a great friendship with her and she has been a wonderful aunt to my kids. 

My husband (53M) and I have three children (25M), (21M) and (19F). Our oldest son Casey (25M) is gay and has always been very gender non-conforming. He would demand to wear ‚Äúgirls clothes‚Äù from the time he was little and would become very angry if he didn‚Äôt get his way. My husband and I didn‚Äôt have anything against this at home but didn‚Äôt allow him to dress like that in public to avoid bullying. My sister introduced Casey to drag through watching the tv show drag race when he was in high school. He actually started performing in drag a few years ago and now performs a few times a month as a hobby. My husband and I have been very supportive and gone to some of his shows. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem with Casey but because of everything we went through with my sister and how he seems to be becoming more and more feminine (he has grown out his hair and is wearing more feminine clothes even when not performing) I do worry that he is ultimately going to transition. I brought this up to my sister and asked if Casey had spoken to her about it. Somehow this really offended her even though it wasn‚Äôt my intention. She didn‚Äôt like that I was trying to find out the details of conversations they have had privately and that after having her as my sister I‚Äôm still worried about having a trans kid. She said it hurt her feelings to know I would be upset if my child turned out like her.

8,1cixxla,AITA for a situation i am in with my mother.,"i (25f) live on my own and my parents have always been very controlling of me as they were with my two older siblings. last year my father died and since then my mom has become extremely overbearing, especially when it comes to money. she‚Äôs constantly asking for money from me, usually for her bill or shopping trips, sometimes even for things i pay for myself (like gas). every time she asks for money she gets angry if i don‚Äôt give it right away and has started getting very manipulative with it, telling me that ‚Äúif you loved your dad you would‚Äù or asking me to help her out because ‚Äúyour dad always did‚Äù so i can‚Äôt really refuse without feeling like a terrible person. 

this has been going on for the past year and last month when she asked if i could give her $80 for my mom to go shopping with, i told her no and that she needed to pay back some of the money she had borrowed from me over the past few months because she was supposed to have paid it back by then. instead of listening, she got upset and asked if i could give her $10 for gas since she was out of money and her car needed gas. i told her no again but said that i would give her some later that day after work if she still needed it. when i came home from work, she had already left and didn‚Äôt come back until late the next night, telling me to go get groceries for her because she was too tired from working all day. 

i went to bed angry at her manipulation of money since she only works part time and has more than enough money in her bank account (i know this because she showed me how much is in there) so the next morning i told my mom that she needed to pay back the $60 she had borrowed from me over the past year. i didn‚Äôt ask for it, i just gave it back to her and told her that if she wanted money again she needed to pay it back first. this made her extremely angry and she started screaming at me about how she was my mother and how she always helped me out when i was growing up so now i have to do the same for her. she said that even though i don‚Äôt live with her anymore, i still owe her everything because she raised me and without her i wouldn‚Äôt be where i am today. this really hurt me because my mom is a great person but she has always been very controlling and manipulative of us as children so i feel like now she is taking advantage of that to get money from me whenever she wants it. anyway, this all happened last week and i haven‚Äôt spoken to her since then.

10,1cixw72,AITA for telling my MIL that I already have a lot of clothes?,"I (26F) have a 2-year relationship with my partner (30M). Although his family has a totally different political ideology than mine, we are very cordial and they are more like my family than my own family. I have a very very bad relationship with my family, in which they neglected me a lot since I was little and abused me in many ways. Until recently all my clothes were donated although my sisters always had new clothes, I always had donations from other people or I bought used clothes with what I had left over from small jobs that I had while I was studying (I sold candy, or bought things on Aliexpress and resold them on Facebook Marketplace). The issue begins with the fact that a few years ago I started having formal jobs and being able to buy my own clothes, so I lost control and bought a LOT of clothes, and only used a small part of them. Why did I only use a small part? Because I'm autistic, and clothes that seemed pretty to me at first glance ended up making me feel uncomfortable. The point here is that I barely always wear the same 5 t-shirts (Dragon ball, Pusheen, Jaws, Hello Kitty and The Exorcist) and 5 pants (Spongebob, Dragon Ball and no prints). My MIL, aware of my bad relationship with my family, noticed that I always wore the same clothes and the same sneakers (Although I have 3 different pairs, they are all the same model) and she started giving me clothes, a lot of clothes, which at first I didn't understand but soon I connected the dots and the next time she gave me something I told her ""Thank you very much, but I have a lot of clothes, I just don't usually use it."".
She was a little surprised and I noticed that she was upset with me for a few days, although she never expressed it verbally, since then she has not given me clothes again.
A friend says that maybe I shouldn't have told her that, because she did it out of genuine concern, but I don't like the idea of her spending money on me.

12,1cixvmi,AITA for cancelling 2 hours before a date? ,"For context I 20F got asked out on a date by a guy 22M. I met him while I was working since he works at the bank and I have to visit the bank to deposit money. We‚Äôve never really interacted except for the small convos when I visit the bank. One day he walks into my office and asks me out on a date, I said yes and agreed since I did find him cute. 

We end up deciding on Saturday which is the day after he asked me out. He calls me the night before to organise the date and we decide on a nice restaurant in the city that he recommended and he ends up paying a $70PP set meal. During the call I realised I started feeling slightly overwhelmed, I have no experience dating and this will be my first date so I felt like it all happened too fast and I would rather have gotten to know him better before being asked out. Also I realised he isn‚Äôt really my type and I didn‚Äôt feel too strong of a chemistry during the call. However, it‚Äôs already a bit late since he already made the reservation so I decided to just push myself to go and just follow through with it. 

The next day I wake up and have this strong gut feeling that I really don‚Äôt want to go on this date. I just felt like I didn‚Äôt want my first date to be this guy and I know it‚Äôs selfish in this case to prioritise myself since he did already pay for the meal and also the date was scheduled in 3 hours. I ended up following my gut feeling and called to him to cancel the date, I told him honestly I just didn‚Äôt feel like it anymore and apologised multiple times. I also offered to pay my part but he said he‚Äôll find a friend to go with so it‚Äôs fine so I didn‚Äôt end up paying him. Unfortunately I still have to see him every Friday and it‚Äôs slightly awkward despite trying to keep it friendly. Do you guys think he finds me flaky or has like a negative opinion toward me?

16,1cixoea,AITA for talking on the phone with a stranger in front of my wife ? ,"Good evening and thank you for reading.

A little context for this situation. My dad is 70 years old. He is a semi-retired divorced boomer who is currently in vacation in Europe with his girlfriend. When I was 16-17, I was an exchange student in France, this was 16 years ago. I have not spoken french or really used it with anybody or anything ever since (l know my fault).

Today my wife asked me if I could drive her mom to buy some things my mother in law needed for an upcoming trip she is having. 

While driving to the store, my dad calls me, I answered the phone and the call goes to speaker phone since my phone was connected to the car's Bluetooth. He opened the call saying "" hey son, I am with 2 french ladies right now, and I can't pronounce the name of the city you lived"" I told him the name of the city I used to live while I was an exchange student. He the goes ""you tell her, talk to her"" and he puts her on the phone. 

This person says hi to me and I do as well. I don't really recall the conversation since my french is very rusty. I just told her, or at least I tried telling her because it seemed like she didn't really understand, that I lived a year in France and that I haven't spoken with anybody in a long time. I tell her take care of my dad to end the call, she puts my dad on the phone and he then just says "" Hey, you want me to take a picture of them so you can see how pretty they are"" and I just answered ""no, I am not interested"" he then laughs at me and says ""ok bye"" and hangs up. Whe he laughed I noticed he was maybe a little drunk, and judging by the hour he called, it was nighttime in Europe.

When the call ended I tell my wife and mother in law what I had said in French since the didn't understand. This is when I see my wife's face and she is furious. I was seriously confused, and may be I screwed up a little, since out of pure reaction I ask her ""are you angry?"" And she goes ""I don't know"". She went dead silent. We bought the stuff and took her mom back. 

Right away we started arguing, she said I humiliated her, to wich I said I never intended to do that, I was trying to be polite to that woman. She also said ""I knew my father's intent"" to wich I really don't even know what to say. Among other things. We had a pretty bad argument, she is really mad at me and doesn't want to speak to me. I tried talking but she ignored me. I really don't feel I did anything wrong.

Was I an asshole?

He the goes ""you tell her, talk to her"" and he puts her on the phone. 

This person says hi to me and I do as well. I don't really recall the conversation since my french is very rusty. I just told her, or at least I tried telling her because it seemed like she didn't really understand, that I lived a year in France and that I haven't spoken with anybody in a long time. I tell her take care of my dad to end the call, she puts my dad on the phone and he then just says "" Hey, you want me to take a picture of them so you can see how pretty they are"" and I just answered ""no, I am not interested"" he then laughs at me and says ""ok bye"" and hangs up. Whe he laughed I noticed he was maybe a little drunk, and judging by the hour he called, it was nighttime in Europe.

When the call ended I tell my wife and mother in law what I had said in French since the didn't understand. This is when I see my wife's face and she is furious. I was seriously confused, and may be I screwed up a little, since out of pure reaction I ask her ""are you angry?"" And she goes ""I don't know"". She went dead silent. We bought the stuff and took her mom back. 

Right away we started arguing, she said I humiliated her, to wich I said I never intended to do that, I was trying to be polite to that woman. She also said ""I knew my father's intent"" to wich I really don't even know what to say. Among other things. We had a pretty bad argument, she is really mad at me and doesn't want to speak to me. I tried talking but she ignored me. I really don't feel I did anything wrong.

Was I an asshole?

17,1cixfti,AITA Friends with benefits until it wasn't ,"About a year ago, I started hanging out with some friends, and one of them turned out to be a woman who worked at the same company as I do. I was 26, she was 35. We never had any interaction at work, as I'm a production manager and she's an executive level director. 

We do have a number of mutual interests and background.  Mainly cooking, college football, and ethnic background.  On a few occasions, some of us would stay overnight so we did not have to drive after drinking. No big deal, I usually ended up on the couch in her home office. '

This goes on for about 4 months. At no time had I made any moves or flirt. 

We made dinner for a group of people, and afterwards, I offered to help clean up and put everything away. We continue drinking a bit, nothing out of the ordinary, not getting drunk, but feeling fine. We decide to watch some TV and she offers to let me sleep on the couch again. Fine by me. 

I admit, I made the first move, I don't know what I was thinking, as it wasn't planned. She stiffened at first, but didn't say no, move away or gave any indication for me to stop. Things progressed, with both of us getting a little heated. 

She pushes me back, and stares for a few seconds. and says that we need to talk before this goes any further. 

If this was to go forward, I need to understand this was not a beginning of a relationship, but just two people enjoying each other. No one can know, and under no circumstances was this to become romantic.  I agreed, and for the next 5 months or so, see each other 1-2 times per month, and I get reminded that I should not get romantically involved. I accept this as fact, and still date people in my own age group. 

You can guess what happens next, she's tells me she's in love with me. It's been so ingrained in my head that the first thing that blurts out of my mouth is ""Well, I don't love you"". I tried to walk it back and explain why, but it was no use. I was told to leave and I did.  I called, texted, and never got another reply.  She resigned and moved out of state to where her parents live. 

A few weeks go by and one of her friends asks to meet me after week and I agree.  I was told I ruined her life, career and caused world hunger. I was the self centered asshole. 

Really, am I the asshole?

Fast forward to us getting married and my in laws have really showed their true colours, literally on the day off. They were extremely demanding and entitled to the extent that my mil tried to force me to leave one of my wedding events right before it was meant to start to pick her up, with absolutely no warning (I could have organised a driver for her if she let me know beforehand).

I asked again and he eventually responded with yea. His attitude and behavior towards me has also been very hostile when I ask work related questions, so I can do my job such as payroll, I‚Äôm met with attitude or he just ignores me and walks away.  So today I‚Äôm trying to leave again and ask if he‚Äôs going to lock up and as usual he walks away.  I‚Äôve had it. I ask what his issue is with me and if he even has permission to be hanging out after hours. As expected he turns it around on me and says ‚Äúdo you want me to have a problem with you‚Äù 
I told him I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing something that could get me in trouble and he says I‚Äôm not his boss.
Cool, so I text the boss and ask he he‚Äôs allowed to be hanging out after I leave for the day. He says no.
I tell my coworker this and he just starts yelling leave me alone. And what did I do to you ?! 
So this guy is over 6ft and easily 230 + 
I‚Äôm 5.2, 120 after I eat a heavy meal. 
I‚Äôve never been scared of this guy but at this point I just leave. 


Why did I never ask the boss before ? Previously I had assumed he made an arrangement and this was all okay. Many of us are aware of his situation and many people have offered him a place to stay. 
But staying at the office ‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs an office suite we lease. He has a key because his job requires him to have one. But for obvious reasons people can‚Äôt just stay there which before I didn‚Äôt think that was happening but now I‚Äôm not so sure. 


Now I just feel bad about the whole thing.

",TL;DR,2024-05-03,"AITA I may have gotten a homeless coworker fired or in trouble (not sure which yet) My coworker is in a tough situation.

This has worked out for the past month and a half. I agreed to try this out.

The last time we were both at my parents‚Äô place, and as we were leaving, I mentioned that we would be coming again in three weeks. Over the past few weeks, when I spoke to them I mentioned that we would be coming on Saturday.

The problem started this past week when his dad caught a cold. We decided that it would be best if we stayed home. Our washing machine was broken, so we took care of that. I had a brief conversation with my mom and she asked us if we wanted to come over that day, but I decided not to because it was such short notice.

I was not aware of this change in plan until today. My husband says that he added it to the shared calendar so I should have known but unfortunately I did not see it.

When we had the conversation today, I thought that it was unfair to change plans after making them. Especially since it was based on a schedule he had decided on. He thinks I‚Äôm being ridiculous because obviously there was a special circumstance that has caused the scheduled rotation to change.

2. Before we set this schedule, my husband didn‚Äôt always make plans in time to see his parents every other week so sometimes it wasn‚Äôt three weeks before we saw them
3. my brother/parents are busy the next couple of Saturdays so if we don‚Äôt go this Saturday, we won‚Äôt see them until Mother‚Äôs Day.

29,1civq6b,AITA for getting an Uber driver fired?,"Throwaway.

The other day, I (M 30) called an Uber to pick me up from work to take me to my weekly trivia game. I don't drive due to a medical condition.

The driver they assigned me refused to pick me up. And he refused to cancel the ride. ""You can do it,"" he kept saying over and over. After several back and forths of me telling him ""No, you cancel it"" if he didn't want to pick me up, he left me on read. I suspected he wouldn't cancel it himself because he thought he'd still get some kind of compensation due to the cancellation fee, so I gave him one more chance and told him, ""If you don't cancel it, I'll be calling Uber right after I do."" Again, he left me on read.

I was already running late at this point, so true to my word, I cancelled the ride, got another ride through Lyft, and used Uber's help feature to explain the situation and report this guy so as not to be charged the cancellation fee. The person they had me texting with said it would be taken care of. I thought that was the end of it.

--until yesterday, when the guy showed up at the school! (I guess he screenshot the ride or wrote down the address before I canceled, I don't know.) He confronted me in the parking lot as I'm walking to that day's Uber because Uber deactivated his account, pending an official review. This dude was IRATE. Another teacher had to come and break it up. He got in his car and drove off.

Because it was so noticeable what happened, today, it got around school to the staff and even some students the basics of what happened. Some of my co-workers are saying I shouldn't have reported him, that potentially costing this man his job was not worth the $35 refund. I don't think I did anything wrong.

For this particular work, I have to set up a team of creatives to work on it. My friends are all very talented but I want to choose the directive that is closest to my creative vision. They all got surprised when I told them that I want them to actually pitch for the position instead of me just accepting them cause they're my friends, one of the in particular got super angry and made a drama, even saying things like ""I'll make it easy for you and won't even apply so it's easier for you to decide"". I feel like they're guilt tripping me into choosing them cause they feel bad. Or am I being way too harsh and taking it way too seriously?  ",0.0,0.015008355,0,1
34,1civ3yb,AITA for making a complaint? ,"So I work in an office and have had to make a few complaints lately. Basically where I work its in an office, a credit union.



I had an issue with a specific employee who would chew up office equipment, pens, ect or put that stuff to their body like pick their scabs or something with it just nasty stuff. I had tried to be really cool and not complain but we share offices and I have to use all that stuff when they are done with it and its nasty. I addressed it directly to this employee and they just laughed it off. and then keeps doing it. I keep going into an office and stuff will be dirty or chewed up and gross and I have to throw this stuff away wash my hands get new stuff. So I got upset about it and decided to send an email. I emailed the employee:



""Please stop chewing on the pens, I have had to throw away a bunch of them. It's nasty when they are put back into the pen cup for members(customers) and other employees to use. Buy some Gum or something. Thank you.""



and CC'd the manager to make sure it was addressed. Wasn't trying to be a dick or rude but it keeps happening and its gross to deal with. We are not in middle school and I have tried asking her nicely a few times to stop with no luck. Well today I get pulled aside saying my email COULD be viewed as rude. And that its being reviewed by my managers manager, her manager and HR. Basically saying I am about to be written up over making a complaint via email. My manager admitted when I said it verbally it didnt sound as bad, and also if I sent it only to the manager it wouldn't have been an issue. Well pretty much every time I fucked up doing something other departments or employees email me directly and CC my manager. Its the go to format for making a complaint or bringing attention to a situation that needs to be addressed. I even talked to the employee chewing the pens if she thought the email was rude or offensive and she said no. She only cared I involved management and didnt talk to her directly (which i tried before.) So now I am about to get a write up over something that MIGHT be considered rude or COULD be considered rude according to the manager. But wasnt rude when pretty much said the same thing in person. The directed employee doesnt think its rude, and I was trying to say please and thank you to crube any unintended meaning in the message.



Was I wrong to even bring it up? Am I in the wrong for making a complaint? Or does it feel like I am being retaliated against for making the complaint at all? I feel like I am being retaliated against. I have had to make other complaints about people not doing their job right forcing me to pick up their slack right before this too and I feel like they are punishing me for bringing this stuff up.

37,1ciutgy,"AITA for defending my ""selfish"" uncle?","I (36f) was at a cousin's wedding. 

Background: there are two autism cases in the family, my sister (who passed away a year ago) with high needs nonverbal autism, and my cousin  (moms older brothers son) who is more independent and verbal but let's just say he's on a first name basis with the cops. He has a younger NT brother who's been pretty trau matized from the whole experience, as have I and my youngest NT sister. We are the only cousins who are unmarried without kids (not that there's anything wrong with this, but I come from a traditional family where it's not considered ""normal""). 

Then my other aunt (moms sister) had 3 daughters, their father was a narcissist and they divorced while they were better adjusted than us and my other cousin they still had issues as a result. Two are married with kids the other just got married 

Then there's my mom's younger brother who has a good marriage with his wife, 3 NT children, neither of the parents are narcissistic. All three ended up married with kids and good jobs and seem very happy and well adjusted. 

My mother and aunt(my marriage, older brothers wife) have bonded over their children with disabilities, and both are in serious denial on how much of an impact it's had in their NT kids, but I can tell their both hurt at having no weddings or grandkids. I heard them gossiping about my younger uncle, that he's  ""selfish"" (he's only mildly so, like grabbing the largest slice of pizza at a super bowl party petty stuff, nothing too extreme, id still take him over my parents any day), I think they are bitterly jealous because his kids turned out much more well adjusted with no major issues (I'm not saying being single with no kids is an issue, but they've been the only one who've ended up without mental health problems). 

I said to them ""say what you want about him but his kids are the most well adjusted of anyone's in the families"" and they said I was ""cruel"" and  I ""have no idea how hard it is to raise a disabled child, he had no disabled kids"" I said ""that may well be but it just goes to show you how much the environment a child grows up in makes a difference in how they turn out as much as you two want to pretend it has no impact whatsoever""

I brought two of my dogs with me, one is potty-trained, the other not yet since its still a puppy. My parents has a 1 year old jack terrier mix who is supposedly potty-trained (not really).  
I was tasked to do everything dog-related i.e. bathing and feeding. Now the problem lies here, one of my dogs and the family dog have tasted human food - like those off the table - and have developed a habit of asking for crumbs during mealtimes. The family dog has the worst case of begging - even pawing at you if you don't it food. I have decided to be strict with this and told my parents beforehand not to give them any, not even seasoned meat, or I'll stop feeding their dog. They agreed.  
So this one mealtime, my dad keep teasing me that he will give a small chunk of meat to the dogs, I keep saying no, don't do it. But, *womp womp*, he tossed the meat to the family dog.

I admit I saw red and declared I'm not feeding their dog anymore. I made progress with both dogs. The habit of begging was wearing off and this small piece of meat negated all my hard work and its back to the start of training them again not to beg for scraps.

And, now they're calling me an asshole and overreacting for keeping my promise that **one** mealtime. I felt guilty with the family dog, thinking they might not provide it with enough food and nutrients, so I kept feeding it. But, I am not talking with any of my parents cause they're mad.

The result was being unemployed for 4 months. I was living paycheck to paycheck, so I was extremely worried that I'd lose my home if I couldn't find a job fast. Thankfully I managed to find the job I'm currently at and I couldn't be happier.

During those 4 months of unemployment I was gifted a book from one of my friends. It was signed by the author (one of the most popular horror novelists of all time, I'm sure you can surmise who I'm talking about), who is one of her all-time favorites. She actually met him in person to get the book signed. The idea behind the gift was that I could sell it if I found myself in a financial bind. I felt bad that she was parting with this obviously prized item in order to help me out, but she insisted I take it. I did. Thankfully I found employment not long after that and I didn't need to sell the book, but I did forget about it's existence once I started the new job.

41,1cjm3zb,AITA for kicking my MIL out of my house for being passive aggressive about my husband cleaning up?,"My husband, Tom, and I recently moved into our house, today we hosted our first dinner party with my mother in law (mil), FIL, BILs and their wives and SIL. I took a day off from the my business to make sure everything was perfect. I spent hours on my feet to make sure everything was perfect, I went grocery shopping, cleaned the house and cooked. By the time everyone got here I was exhausted but I still entertained everyone because I was so excited to have them over.



Everyone was having a good time, even MIL, I think its because Tom and I sat at opposite end of the table and she got to sit next to him. We moved to the living room to have dessert and that's when everything went to crap. I was in the kitchen with SIL plating up the desserts she brought and making more ice cream. A few minutes later Tom came back and started clearing up the dishes that were on the table, I didn't ask him to do this, he's just like this. MIL heard us talking and came to the kitchen and saw Tom loading the dishwasher, she asked if he knew what he was doing and he told he did.



MIL came in after Tom went back to the living room and said (I forgot some of the other stuff she said).

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-03,"AITA for kicking my MIL out of my house for being passive aggressive about my husband cleaning up? My husband, Tom, and I recently moved into our house, today we hosted our first dinner party with my mother in law (mil), FIL, BILs and their wives and SIL. I took a day off from the my business to make sure everything was perfect. I spent hours on my feet to make sure everything was perfect, I went grocery shopping, cleaned the house and cooked. By the time everyone got here I was exhausted but I still entertained everyone because I was so excited to have them over.



Everyone was having a good time, even MIL, I think its because Tom and I sat at opposite end of the table and she got to sit next to him. We moved to the living room to have dessert and that's when everything went to crap. I was in the kitchen with SIL plating up the desserts she brought and making more ice cream. A few minutes later Tom came back and started clearing up the dishes that were on the table, I didn't ask him to do this, he's just like this. MIL heard us talking and came to the kitchen and saw Tom loading the dishwasher, she asked if he knew what he was doing and he told he did.

42,1cjlv3y,AITA for failing to stop my MIL buying ‚Äòlandfill‚Äô for my kids at a funfair?,"
I went to a local funfair with my kids & mother in law (MIL).

We decided to walk around looking at all the rides before deciding what to go on. 

MIL had forgotten her wallet so it would be me buying any rides. (This let me relax about the sometimes tricky dynamic of who is paying for what.)

As we walked past a prize stall (pay money to win a prize), MIL commented in shock at the high price & I agreed.

At the next ride, my husband joined us. He & I were chatting when we noticed that MIL had gone back to the previous prize stall with the kids.

He asked urgently what I had agreed with her about that stall, & I (slightly confused at his urgency) remembered we had both thought it overpriced.

I knew she didn‚Äôt have money on her so I assumed they had just gone back to look.

We have disagreed with MIL many times about her excessive (in our view) gifts for the kids. Each visit she buys toys which soon get discarded, or more sweets & snacks than the kids can eat.

This is important to us because (a) we want to teach the kids moderation & value rather than excessive disposable expenditure, (b) we are worried about the environment & the excess of toys contributes to landfill, (c) while she has the right to use her money, the amount spent on this stuff feels wasteful when it could be used for more lasting things for the kids.

Back to the fun fair.

My husband insisted I tell him what I had ‚Äúagreed‚Äù with MIL. We hadn‚Äôt agreed anything, I told him. We agreed it was priced too high?

I then noticed she had taken out her phone to pay using her contactless payment.

Husband said he didn‚Äôt want her buying it, & I said he should go tell her. He insisted he didn‚Äôt want to do that before finding out what I had agreed with her. 

I told him if he could see what was happening he should go & stop her.

By now it was finished & I said look it‚Äôs done now, it‚Äôs her money to spend & if she wants to have fun with the kids by spending ¬£15 on a prize stall that‚Äôs up to her, & that I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúagreed‚Äù anything with her as I believed she had forgotten her wallet.

After we got home he picked a huge fight with me, telling me he was really distressed by the landfill of the prizes (the toys are already falling apart), & the repeated messages this kind of spending sends to the kids about the value of things. 

His main complaint at me is that when we first saw the stall before he joined us, he insists I should have told MIL not to buy it for the kids, & the facts that (a) I believed she had no means of paying & (b) had commented on how overpriced it was were not relevant, I still should explicitly have said that we didn‚Äôt want her to buy anything. 

I think this is unreasonable & would have made things really awkward at what was supposed to be a fun outing.

He says it‚Äôs my fault that MIL spent her money on poor quality prizes which will be landfill by next week.

45,1cjksr1,AITA for asking a deaf person to stop signing in class because it was distracting? ,"First off, for some context, I am a music major in college and I‚Äôm all for accessibility, when, let‚Äôs say Joe, when Joe introduced himself and his interpreter I said wow! This is really interesting. 

Everything was fine, we all got used to the interpreter being there and no one really payed attention to the fact that he was deaf. Except for one class. A class that everyone as music majors take, a performance recital class. In this class people take turns each week to Perform, it was explained to us in the beginning of the year some of the basic common decency like clapping when they finish singing, not talking, turning off your phone, stuff like that. Just being nice for the performer‚Ä¶ you know? 

Anyways, the year started off fine in this class, but lately you could tell he wasnt signing to his interpreter about the songs , the reason for this is because we sing opera/classical songs in this class so the interpreter didn‚Äôt know the language to be fair NO ONE did so she definitely wasn‚Äôt translating the songs but rather just cracking jokes because He‚Äôs laughing! In the middle of the performances! You could just imagine as a performer seeing someone laugh as you are performing?!  On top of that, this is all happening in the front row! with the interpreter in front of the stage on the side laughing as well! Snickering and giggling all throughout the performance so much so that even one of the performers look to the side to see what happening but just kept singing and ignoring it. 

I tried ignoring it thinking you know what, he‚Äôs deaf, he already has a hard time, no need to bug him more but I finally had enough when a friend of mine sang her song and she and I previously translated the song, it was a very very sad song about death and deleteing yourself. What was Joe doing? Signing, not just signing, SMACKING- ( EDIT; I say smacking because I had ask another deaf friend of mine and he said a deaf person knows when they are smacking their hands because it hurts and if he was doing it loud enough to hear then he knows what he‚Äôs doing) -his hands and laughing bout something else, he made a gesture that you do when someone is pregnant?!?!? You know like the making a circle over your stomach and rubbing anyways Maybe that means something else, but laughing like come on, not just quiet laughing btw audible snickering. 

Finally, I had enough and went up to both him and the interpreter how I understand the need the translate the slate what the teacher is saying and everything the else but that the last song that my friend sang was not a funny song and that it was not only distracting but rude to be talking and laughing while someone is performing even so when your right smack in the front row. The interpreter stayed quiet and he just went on to say that I‚Äôm abilist and that it shouldn‚Äôt matter what he does because he‚Äôs deaf and I can‚Äôt take his mean of communicating, but I‚Äôm not saying he should stop!

I felt terrible about this because those were obviously meant for someone else to surprise their lover, and she was selfishly stealing them.

49,1cjklrd,WIBTA for saying no to my mom? ,"Me (20) and my mom (46) don't spend alot of time together. This bothers me alot because im the only one of my siblings (age 12, 15 and 18) that moved out (long story but its basicly because she choose that it was better for ""us all"" that I moved out, instead of my dad that emotionaly abused me, the second I turned 18 even when I could not pay my bills and didnt want to leave home, I'm okey now.) I have seen her about 10 times in the past six months and none of those moments where one on one planned events and just to say hi to my 3 siblings. 
Every time I express I want to do something with her she turns it down because she is too tired, has other things to do or has a day planned with her boyfriend (my parents got devorced 3 months after I left but I wasn't alowed to move back in). We havent even gone to dinner for my 20th birthday like she prommised we would. My birthday is on may 27th and im turning 21 in a few weeks... Three weeks ago I expressed for the thousenth time I felt neglected and not part of the family. For yall's info: she went to musicals, museums and shopping etc. with my 3 other siblings and im never allowed to be at the house for longer than like 3 hours because she is tired and I have adhd so im kinda hyper sometimes. Having diner at the house with them has to be scedueld about 3 weeks in advance.

So we finaly picked a date, may 9th, dinner and it was her idea!
Yesterday she asked if we could maybe go on the 10th and have lunch instead. I was kinda disapointed but told her that I have other appoinments on the 10th so I would like to go the 9th still. I also said that dinner or even drinks would be more fun for me if she didn't have time for dinner. She reacted that actualy, her planning got shuffled because she had to take the kids on a day she had planned with her boyfriend, that ment she couldnt spend that day with him and wanted to spend time with him on the 9th. Which means our dinner would not be happening. She asked if I wanted to go the week after. I am realy upset right now because I feel like I'm not important enough and she doesnt care and her boyfriend has priority over my birthday dinner. (she sees him every week) Like I mentioned I have adhd so sudden changes of my plans stress me out alot and social interactions take alot out of me. So its dificult for me to re-route my brain that I wouldn't see her on the 9th but a later date. On the other hand. It would only be a week later and its not like I wouldnt go out to dinner with her at all.
I also have a problem with the way she went about it. First not being honest about the reason for the change of planns and later like I would ofcourse say yes and that it was not something she should atleast kind of apologise for.

So: would I the asshole if I said no to her question and insist on the 9th?

50,1cjkja7,AITA For Being Late to A Hangout,"I (20sF) had 4 of my friends (all 20sF) ditch me after running late to dinner. This is my last week in this city and I wanted to spend some quality time with them before I left. I‚Äôve been busy with moving preparations (I‚Äôm moving across the coast), and I was unfortunately held up pretty late because I was on the line with customer service about a late delivery for over an hour (if I didn‚Äôt sort it out, I wouldn‚Äôt have a mattress to sleep on when I arrived).

My friends were meeting at a casual place where you stand in line and grab a slice (usually standing). They had miraculously all gotten there on time, so I suggested rather than wait and lose a rare available table at an incredibly busy pizza joint, they all go ahead and sit down and eat. We were all planning on getting pizza and then heading to a swanky bar after for drinks, so I figured I‚Äôd meet them at the bar. I let them know Iw as running late and suggested I grab a quick bite while they‚Äôre finishing up pizza, and we‚Äôll meet at the bar to which they agreed.

I was at a nearby casual eatery about to order at the counter when I got a text, 45 minutes after our initial agreed meet time that they were leaving. I was pretty dismayed, since it was pretty strange they were all collectively leaving so soon after meeting up. I texted them, asking if I had angered them by being late, and two of the four confirmed they were upset and hurt that I was late and said they felt like I wasn‚Äôt prioritizing our hang out enough.

51,1cjk6cs,"AITA for wanting to drop college and work, and pursue creative endeavors?","Hello! I (19M) am stuck in a difficult position in life.

I work a 9-5 under my mom's company while also at the same time going to college to study video game design. Now, I will immediately say that this is not what I originally wanted to study. I want to study animation, however, colleges that teach such a thing don't exist in the country I live in, so here I am. Yes, I want to study animation for the sake of creating games, but I don't want to learn game design itself, the trade itself of game design is not something I'm interested in. (Largely because of my massive skill issue that makes it so I can't learn how to code in any language whatsoever.)

Every time I come home from work, I am tired, and unable to work on the things I want to work on- YouTube videos, animations, art, and whatnot. When there's college work involved, I have much less time to do.. well, anything.

This has led me down into a loop that continuously makes me more, and more sad- eventually leading me into a depressive state. Come Home -> Want to work on things -> Can't because too tired -> Frustration -> Rest up -> Work a little bit on what I want to do -> Sleep -> Repeat.

I have tried to talk to my mother about the possibility of, maybe after this quarter is done, to let me temporarily drop everything- work and college, in order to pursue these endeavors, but she threw a fit on how I am being selfish and not caring enough about my future- and how all I want is to mindlessly play games without doing anything... which I guess is half true. I want to build an online career- make a living off my art and my talent, but college is very much draining me, even more so when it comes to having a job in the picture, and it's taking a heavy toll on my mental health.

Now my father, while he isn't crazy about the idea of me dropping everything, he is willing to give me a bunch of months, maybe half a year or so, to let me grind hard on my social media to see if I can manage to make some results and see if it really is just ""college and work holding me back"", or if I'm just being lazy. My dream has always been to have an online career and live off my own creations.

I understand my mom's side of the argument- I'm being selfish for throwing all of these responsibilities away just because ""muh youtube channel"" and other things, but at the same time, I wish she would see my point. I'm getting overworked and incredibly tired, because my free time hours are... pretty much nonexistent. Most I get are 2 hours to barely sketch, lineart, and color a drawing before I have to go to sleep. I don't even get to finish the drawings, nine times out of ten.

52,1cjk523,WIBTA If I kept some of the insurance money from my car (that my sister totaled),"Update #1: So far I‚Äôve seen similar opinions from everyone and I appreciate everyone‚Äôs comment. We‚Äôre having a BBQ tonight since my sister just got back from school for the semester. I‚Äôm going to bring it up with everyone at dinner and I‚Äôll post a second update letting everyone know how it went. 

Bit of background, I bought a new car in 2022 and gave my old one to my sister after she totaled her last one. Since then, my mother has been paying the car payment for her (she was a minor). With the payment history split between us, I've paid for 60% of the car to date, while my mother has paid the other 40%. My mother came in a told me they were looking at new vehicles today and that she wouldn't mind putting $4-6k down on a car if it meant a low interest and monthly payment (this money comes from the insurance payout being sent to me). I commented that I would need at least $1500 to pay off some credit card debt, and was told no. Now, I don't mind helping out, but I was just told that I wouldn't be receiving any of the insurance money meant to pay for my vehicle, because my younger sister needs it more? Why does the person who has totaled three vehicles in four years need to put $4k+ on a brand new vehicle, and $400 to pay off her credit card, but I can't get $1500 to pay off a credit card to make my life easier?   
  
Would I be the asshole splitting the money based on how it was paid? 60/40. The original loan was 48 months, we have 8 months left, I paid the first 20 and $1500 down, and my mother the second 20. That would give me $3500, much more than I originally asked for, and leave $2500 to pay off her credit card, and the rest as a down payment on another car. I feel like this is going to be an unreasonable offer considering they both assumed they would get the entire amount.

53,1cjk0hz,AITA for not driving my friend to work? ,"AITA because I didn't drive my friend to work, even though I wasn't busy?

I (34f) have had a friend (35f) for decades . We'll call her Mary. 

Mary and I met in school. We were best friends. When her dad passed away suddenly in high school I dropped everything to help. Attended the wake, helped at the service, cleaned up the hall after. I sent her cards and care packages on the anniversary for years after. 

I also became closer with her family since my parents were both neglectful and abusive. I didn't move in or anything  but her mom took me bra shopping for my first bra, took me on family vacation once, and helped plan a baby shower for me.

I, in turn, did my best to show up for her. I was there helping at her grandmother's funeral,I visited her mom to help around the house, I pulled a load of poison oak out of her yard (Mary didn't help), I helped both of them haul out moldy carpet when their basement flooded... You name it. They also made sure to attend my family events (my kids' birthdays).

But then a few years ago her mom died, and it felt like Mary completely stopped reciprocating. I understand that it is hard to lose your parents (mine aren't in the picture), but I'm a single mom and a teacher, and she never seemed to show up when I needed help. Not at my grandparents' funerals, not when I moved out and got divorced, not when I needed help recovering from surgery (though she did drop me off at the hospital, which I genuinely appreciated).

 She also became more needy and demanding, and if I didn't respond to every social media post and message she would guilt trip me. Conversations always revolved around her problems, and if I ever talked about mine she'd essentially say that it was my fault. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells. 

Finally, I told her I needed some space, because I felt like the dynamic was not healthy.

A few weeks later, though, she called to ask for a ride to work, as her car wouldn't start. Normally? I would have dropped everything. But this time I didn't. 

My reasons:

1) She lives an hour away from me (one way), and ten minutes from her work

2) She has and uses Uber, which would have cost less than my gas to come get her

3) She makes twice what I make (and has no kids), so what would have been a small amount to her was a lot to me

4) She owns two cars, but keeps letting the registration lapse on the one that used to be her mom's

5) When I had a car accident that left me without transportation for a month, she never offered help, even though she had a whole second car gathering dust in her driveway. I know I'm not entitled to her help, but it definitely hurt.

54,1cjjtjk,AITA for forgetting my sisters birthday ,"I (21f) have 2 half siblings (35m & 41f). However we have always considered each other full siblings.

I‚Äôve been estranged from my sister for about 2 years for a variety of reasons. She is a narcissist and has done many things to myself and the people I care about (ie. stole my college tuition money, crashed my mom‚Äôs car, called me many names etc.) and everyone gives the excuse of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how she is‚Äù. I am happy that she is happy and in a good place, but I don‚Äôt want her in my life.

I have seen her in person once when my brother was in the hospital last month and we texted once or twice. We never ‚Äúmade amends‚Äù or anything, despite my father wanting us to.

Sadly, my grandma passed away about 2 weeks ago (not HER own grandmother). It‚Äôs my first death and to be honest I‚Äôm not-handling it well. I had to fly out for the funeral separately from my parents. It was the travel day from hell.

It was a complete white out snowstorm. From what should have only been 4 hours in travel (flight/drive) ended up being 13. Started at 3am and did not arrive till 8pm. Was not a fun day and I did not think I was gonna make it to the funeral the next morning.

I‚Äôve been estranged from my sister for about 2 years for a variety of reasons.

I am happy that she is happy and in a good place, but I don‚Äôt want her in my life.

I have seen her in person once when my brother was in the hospital last month and we texted once or twice. We never ‚Äúmade amends‚Äù or anything, despite my father wanting us to.

Sadly, my grandma passed away about 2 weeks ago (not HER own grandmother). It‚Äôs my first death and to be honest I‚Äôm not-handling it well. I had to fly out for the funeral separately from my parents. It was the travel day from hell.

It was a complete white out snowstorm. From what should have only been 4 hours in travel (flight/drive) ended up being 13. Started at 3am and did not arrive till 8pm. Was not a fun day and I did not think I was gonna make it to the funeral the next morning.

57,1cjj0ds,AITA roommate problems,"#AITA
I (25F) recently moved to a new apartment with a new roommate. She (25+F) was already living here for some time before me. We both have pet cats and agreed that when I first moved in we should keep them separate and in our respective bedrooms for the first week or so. After that time, I suggested we slowly start introducing the cats when the two of us were home (veterinarian recommendations say this can take 1 week or up to 2 months). She, roommate, didn't want to introduce them, saying her cat spends all its time in her bedroom with her and that it wasn't necessary for them to meet. Because I work a full time job with long hours and my bedroom is very small, I asked if my cat could hangout in the common areas when I was away at work (keeping her in my room at night). Roommate said it was fine. Two months have passed and my roommate has essentially banned me from opening the common room curtains,  using the gas stove, using the mircowave (she moved it into her bedroom), inviting guests over without a minimum 3 days notice (and she keeps trying to get me to tell her what my guests level of education is because ""anyone with less than a college degree is not worth her time"") as well, she, on multiple occasions allowed the two cats to interact when I was not home, despite (as previously stated) our cats not having gone through the introduction process, my repeatedly telling her that my cat has had no prior interactions with other animals since her adoption 3 years ago and that my cat needed time to get used to another animal. The two cats do not get along (they have not caused each other injury), they hiss and growl at each other before my roommate takes her cat away. Now roommate is saying my cat is aggressive and is giving me grief about allowing my cat into the common areas even though I now only do so when I am home and after I have giving my roommate warning that I will be in the common areas with my cat; specifying that once I am done in the common areas I will be taking my cat back to my bedroom. 
In an effort to be considerate to both my roommate and my cat, I have scheduled a veterinary appointment to find out what more I could be doing for my cat regarding her behavior. I have told my roommate about the appointment and have been keeping my cat in my room (until the vet appointment) except for supervised playtime in the common areas when my roommate is either in her bedroom with her cat or not home. 
Despite all my effort, roommate is calling me passive aggressive and a bad pet owner.

59,1cjioe2,AITA for abandoning her in the city?,"So, last night a friend of mine went to her first day of work in the city.  She's... a bit disadvantaged, to put it kindly - no car of her own, and the public transit doesn't go anywhere near her place.  For reasons not known to me, her day was from 1 PM to roughly 9 PM.

As I was busy with my own work, I'd lent her money to get an Uber to get to work, but I'd intended to pick her up from the office to take her home.  I arrive roughly 9:04 PM, and parked immediately outside the elevator lobby for the building she was in.  I call up, she says she'll be out in 5 minutes.

5 minutes pass... 10 minutes... give her a text poke at 13 minutes (9:17 PM) with no response.  20 minutes... 25 minutes (9:29 PM) another poke.  I'd finally gotten a response at 28 minutes, saying she's just finishing something up.  Alright, fine, and I re-iterate over text I'm waiting for her outside the elevator lobby.

35 minutes.  40 minutes.  43 minutes (9:47 PM), ""do you see a green truck?  I have 1% battery left but I'm standing by the green truck.""

I start scanning the entire block the office's building is on, looking for a green truck.  Running around the entire area, until *11:00 PM* (almost *two hours*) trying to find her to no avail.  Several calls and texts were sent her way in case she found an outlet, but nothing.  Phone immediately went to a full voicemail inbox.

And so, I start heading home.  By the time I was leaving the city and had no opportunity to turn around, I finally get a text back.  ""My phone died.""  I try to call, but she declines and texts back ""I have 2%.""

I just couldn't anymore.  I headed home, admittedly angry that she couldn't use anything more concrete than a *potentially mobile object* to indicate where she was.

To keep it simple, I (24f) was at work today when my roommate (Em, 24F) broke one of my bowls. It wasn‚Äôt an expensive bowl, just under five bucks but I really liked it. It was a pretty colour and hard to find at the store since not all of them have it. 

Anyway, Em texted me that she accidentally broke it and I replied to her that it‚Äôs fine, no problem. I told her I‚Äôll get another one this evening because I knew which store had it. A little under an hour or so later, she texted me saying that she bought it. I asked her why and told her again that I would get it. She replied to me saying that she felt bad. I assumed she found the same one she has broken so we left it at that. 

When she got home some time later she gave the bowl to me. It was a completely different design, much heavier than the previous bowl which was the perfect weight for me to carry. And on top of that she got me a second, star shaped bowl/dipping bowl just like that. She told me she couldn‚Äôt find the exact one so she brought me these. I said thanks and she left for work for her evening shift. 

But honestly, I‚Äôve just feeling a little bit frustrated internally because I would‚Äôve have preferred she not buy me a bowl (much less two) especially since she didn‚Äôt find an exact one. And I had already told her twice that she didn‚Äôt need to replace it but she did anyway. 

For context. I live with two other roommates besides Em. We have a really small kitchen, even less storage space. My roommates keep some of their utensils in my drawer since it‚Äôs slightly larger than theirs. I don‚Äôt have space for an extra bowl. 

I know it seems like a stupid problem to have but it feels burdening. I buy my own things because I like things in my life a certain way. I broke one of Em‚Äôs containers a few months ago as well. But I made sure to find an exact one to replace the broken one.

For some background Me and my brother James still live with my parents. While my brother Jake moved out years ago with his boyfriend about an hour away from us. My parents in recent years have expressed to us how they‚Äôve been struggling with money and how bad their credit scores are to hopefully teach us to be smarter with our money and credit card. 

I hurt my back at work late last year and lost my job in January cause of it. I cannot talk about what happened cause of the legal case going on. At this point I became very depressed but I was still looking for a job because of the medical bills I needed to pay off due to the injury. My dad had already said he would help me with them but I hated depending on my parents. James quit his job due to them being rude towards. My grandma, Me and now My oldest brother Jake have had to help my brother James out with paying off his credit card because he didn‚Äôt want it to be late. James has also been asking my grandma in recent months to help pay for certain stuff. To the point my grandma said something to my mother how she got tired of him asking for money. He asked me and my grandma first which paid us back both a few weeks later with money he got back from college. 

This last time he asked Jake. A week prior Jake asked me if I could watch his animals while he goes on vacation with his boyfriend. I happily agreed and didn‚Äôt know at the time he would pay me. My mom explained to me he would be paying 200 so I was extremely grateful to hear. When I found out I was getting paid I had already planned on using it to pay some of my medical bills. Last night I get a text from James telling me I no longer needed to watch my Jake‚Äôs animals. I asked why and he said that he was stupid with his credit card again and had to ask Jake to pay for it before it was late. me and him exchanged a few messages before I said ‚ÄúNo leave me alone. You screwed me over cause you can't manage money it's fucking ridiculous. You literally have nothing going on and yet somehow still manage to use your credit card like an idiot. 

Now I have to be out 200 dollars that I wanted to use to pay shit off for my medical bills cause i'm not like you I don't want to depend on mom and dad forever.‚Äù and blocked his number. I have anger issues and I had already been mad about having to take James everywhere when my dad didn‚Äôt feel like it cause James has no license. I will admit I feel like what I said back was a bit harsh after he was trying to get me paid still. However I think I‚Äôm tired of my parents not pushing him hard enough to get a job or a drivers license but always pushed me very hard to do so.

I (19F) have two older brothers let‚Äôs call them James (22M) and Jake (27M). For some background Me and my brother James still live with my parents. While my brother Jake moved out years ago with his boyfriend about an hour away from us. My parents in recent years have expressed to us how they‚Äôve been struggling with money and how bad their credit scores are to hopefully teach us to be smarter with our money and credit card. 

I hurt my back at work late last year and lost my job in January cause of it. I cannot talk about what happened cause of the legal case going on. At this point I became very depressed but I was still looking for a job because of the medical bills I needed to pay off due to the injury. My dad had already said he would help me with them but I hated depending on my parents. James quit his job due to them being rude towards. My grandma, Me and now My oldest brother Jake have had to help my brother James out with paying off his credit card because he didn‚Äôt want it to be late. James has also been asking my grandma in recent months to help pay for certain stuff. To the point my grandma said something to my mother how she got tired of him asking for money. He asked me and my grandma first which paid us back both a few weeks later with money he got back from college. 

This last time he asked Jake. A week prior Jake asked me if I could watch his animals while he goes on vacation with his boyfriend. I happily agreed and didn‚Äôt know at the time he would pay me. My mom explained to me he would be paying 200 so I was extremely grateful to hear. When I found out I was getting paid I had already planned on using it to pay some of my medical bills. Last night I get a text from James telling me I no longer needed to watch my Jake‚Äôs animals. I asked why and he said that he was stupid with his credit card again and had to ask Jake to pay for it before it was late. me and him exchanged a few messages before I said ‚ÄúNo leave me alone. You screwed me over cause you can't manage money it's fucking ridiculous. You literally have nothing going on and yet somehow still manage to use your credit card like an idiot. 

Now I have to be out 200 dollars that I wanted to use to pay shit off for my medical bills cause i'm not like you I don't want to depend on mom and dad forever.‚Äù and blocked his number. I have anger issues and I had already been mad about having to take James everywhere when my dad didn‚Äôt feel like it cause James has no license. I will admit I feel like what I said back was a bit harsh after he was trying to get me paid still. However I think I‚Äôm tired of my parents not pushing him hard enough to get a job or a drivers license but always pushed me very hard to do so.

64,1cji4lb,AITAH for wanting a distanced relationship to save money?,"So for context, my (29m) gf (28f), her son(5), my 70lb dog, her tiny dog, and cat, all live together in a sub 800sqft apartment. She works in property management and even with the 40% discount, we are in the red for our income/expenses ratio. On top of that, my dog and the cat don‚Äôt get along.

Yes, it is a lot in a small space. However, because of the hemorrhaging we‚Äôve been experiencing financially, we have been looking for new ways to save, and ultimately get into a house. Whether that be our own or a rental property. Either way, we need and very much desire the space. I‚Äôve been in the middle of a career change as I got a degree in an art (I still love it, but at this point I would have much preferred a skill or trade). She is happy with her job, and for what‚Äôs it‚Äôs offered her so far, I don‚Äôt blame her. If not for needing the space that I add, she and her sister, who also works in property management and has a free apartment, would be great. 

Now to the issue, with our brainstorming we each have different solutions, only we think the other‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a solution. I think her idea is a bandaid for broken bones and internal bleeding, she thinks mine is an unnecessary amputation, or a break up. When in my head, my plan is simply distance for a few months until her son is in actual school, saving the $2700/mo child care expense. 

She wants us all to move into a 1 bdrm, that is about 90sqft more than where we are currently, which is a 2 bed 1 bath‚Ä¶ its been hard here with two rooms, I don‚Äôt see how 1 helps, it only adds stress elsewhere instead of our finances. Which isn‚Äôt even truly alleviated, just a lighter blow. I think she should move in with her sister, for FREE rent, while I go live with my parents for FREE, then we get our own place, with her 40% discount, once lil man starts school. By then maybe we can at least get a 2x2 apartment. No guarantees on an apartment at any given time, but we‚Äôd be guaranteed to save money until one was found.

The guarantee she is making is that we‚Äôd be broken up, cause long distance relationships are a boundary for her, and not something she is willing to do. This makes me feel a little trapped by her thinking, cause I simply don‚Äôt agree, but I love her and don‚Äôt want to be without her if I can‚Äôt even tell myself that I‚Äôm away for a reason. I don‚Äôt want to leave, but I don‚Äôt see the need in an avoidable struggle when support is available, just not in the way we want. We‚Äôve only been dating a year, but a lot has happened with us, making it feel like we‚Äôve been together longer than that. I don‚Äôt want to lose her. I just need some advice.

Last week, I brought a friend Lucy (F35) to hang out with us. Lucy had met everyone before, but I am her only friend from the group. Everyone else is more of an acquaintance. 

We all had a good time. Lucy messaged everyone to tell her what a good time she had. One of out friends, Frank (M55), messaged her to tell her that he was happy to see her too. He said they ought to hang out sometime.

Thing is, Frank has tried to pick up other female friends I have introduced to him in the past. He never asks me, or anyone else about whether they are available or would be interested. He never talks about them at all while they aren't around, even to ask how they are doing if he hasn't seen them in a while.

My one friend, Penny, went to his house after going out for food one night. It didn't go well. She ghosted him, and stopped coming to my house if he was there. He ended up leaving desperate messages in her voice-mail, and confronted her at work, saying that he was in love with her, that she broke his heart, and so forth. I am the only know who knows about. I don't speak to Penny anymore, but I have kept it secret for years.

I know he had female friends, more than most guys I know. I presume he is capable of being friends with a girl if they set clear boundaries and share common interests. 

I told Lucy if she want to hang out with  him that was fine, but she should know he was probably looking for a girlfriend so she should make sure he knows she is in a long distance relationship.

The next time Frank talked to Lucy, he asked her where she saw herself in the future. She immediately told him about her boyfriend, and went on to talk exclusively about her relationship with her boyfriend. Frank asked her why she had never brought up her boyfriend before, and told her that she was wasting her time in a long distance relationship due to her age. 

Frank continued trying to make arrangements to hang out, just him and her, but Lucy was super uncomfortable at that point. She told me, and said I would talk to a common friend, Ryan (38M), to see of he could talk to Frank about it.

After hearing the story, Ryan said that it wasn't Frank's fault for being rude. It was Lucy's fault for not setting boundaries, and overcharging personal information. He said, Frank was a 'respectful adult' and we shouldn't get involved in it.

70,1cjgs14,AITA for telling my wife I don't want her employee to live with us?,"My wife owns an auto business in the US, combining sales and service. As a new venture, she can't afford top-tier workers, so she hires skilled workers facing personal challenges, like those in recovery or with criminal records. We believe in giving these individuals a chance to rebuild their lives.

One of her employees, Mike, is a talented but troubled salesperson. After a painful divorce and losing his children, Mike moved here to start anew. He faced long-term unemployment due to Covid and lived in a sober house due to financial constraints.

Mike is effective in sales but comes with complications. His personal clutter consumes the workspace, and despite space offered for personal items, he overuses it. His work is excellent, but he has caused disruptions. For example, he has initiated conflicts with other staff on busy days, impacting work completion.

My wife owns an auto business in the US, combining sales and service. As a new venture, she can't afford top-tier workers, so she hires skilled workers facing personal challenges, like those in recovery or with criminal records. We believe in giving these individuals a chance to rebuild their lives.

One of her employees, Mike, is a talented but troubled salesperson. After a painful divorce and losing his children, Mike moved here to start anew. He faced long-term unemployment due to Covid and lived in a sober house due to financial constraints.

Mike is effective in sales but comes with complications. His personal clutter consumes the workspace, and despite space offered for personal items, he overuses it. His work is excellent, but he has caused disruptions. For example, he has initiated conflicts with other staff on busy days, impacting work completion.

71,1cjg9jo,AITA for taking back a gift after I learned the birthday person would not be the one using it?,"My daughter, Jenny, (13) has a best friend, Morgan (nearly 13). The two of them spend a lot of time together at our place. I do not know Morgan‚Äôs mother very well as Jenny doesn‚Äôt often go to their house. This is mainly because Morgan‚Äôs house is a little chaotic. She has 4 siblings. Jenny is an only child and Morgan has said she likes the quiet.

Morgan has done a lot of stuff with us. I occasionally enter radio/online competitions and will win tickets to certain local events. When I won 4 tickets to a concert last year, Jenny and I brought Morgan along with one other friend. We all had a blast.

Recently, I won another pair of tickets to a concert that I planned to attend with Jenny. A few days after, I was told about a work trip that I have to take that falls that weekend. Jenny usually comes with me. So, Jenny suggested we give the tickets to Morgan for her birthday. She could either go with another friend or her mom. I checked with Morgan‚Äôs mom before we mentioned this to Morgan and she said that was fine.

Last night, Morgan was at our house and she seemed upset. When I asked why, she said her mom was taking her brother to the concert because ‚Äúher brother has never been to a concert before‚Äù. I asked if Morgan‚Äôs brother even liked the band and Morgan said no, it was just the principle of the matter. Morgan and her other 3 siblings have been to concerts. He hasn‚Äôt and since they can‚Äôt afford stuff like this, he gets to go.

I found this unfair and honestly a waste of tickets. I called Morgan‚Äôs mom to double check this story and she confirmed it all, including her 11 year old son barely knowing anything about the band. I said I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt feel right giving these as a birthday gift anymore as these were for Morgan. I said we‚Äôd give them to Jenny and Morgan‚Äôs other friend who I know likes the band, and we‚Äôll get Morgan something else for her birthday. Morgan is fine with this.

Morgan‚Äôs mom is pissed and says I‚Äôm trying to tell her how to parent. I don‚Äôt think I am because if a different friend gave Morgan the tickets and it was the same result, as shitty as I‚Äôd find her mom doing this, I wouldn‚Äôt say anything as that‚Äôs not my business. As I am giving the tickets, I want them to go to Morgan. I‚Äôd also maybe feel different if the brother loved the band too but as he doesn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt want to give them. 

So here I am left wondering if I‚Äôm being an ass here?

73,1cjfvgc,AITA for blowing up at my mother because she just don't listen?,"I(27M) grew up in a house with a large family(grandma had 11 kids and 15 grandkids) and to be heard in this crowded place we learned to be loud, that's why every time i feel unheard I tend to speak louder(but i try to avoid it). 

My mom(52F) is a difficult woman, I love her but its hard to be calm when we speak cause she doesnt listen, every time she asks something to our family she doesnt wait the answer, and then 5 minutes later she asks again, but its even worse when we are talking and have different opinions, she just ignores whatever we're saying and repeats her reasoning again and again, and with my loudness we constantly end up arguing.

Today's topic was my dog's food, I'm trying to make my dog have a healthier diet, but she constantly gives him things that I don't think its good to give to a dog, like when she gives him bread dipped in coffee in the breakfast, or when she puts our seasoned food in his dog food at lunch or dinner, and because of this he doesnt eat dog food anymore, and when we put dog food mixed with our food he just eats our food and leaves the rest.

So I looked up on the internet and found a training method using only dog food by basically waiting til the correct feeding time and give just dog food to him, and only after he eats the dog food you give him some treat that he likes, so we can make him like his food again and stop eating seasoned food.

I said this to her and pleaded her to not feed him other foods, and when I came home from work to lunch I said we should start doing it to see if it works, but when i went to his bowl she said that i should put some meat to him, again i explained that the reason i was trying this is to make him like his dog food again and we could later make a more varied diet since he would eat everything in the bowl and not only our food, but she ignored me and repeated herself adding that i was being cruel, we had this back and forth for 5 min. until I became frustrated and said in a harsher tone that ""I'm just trying to train MY dog,  I'm not trying to feed him shit or starve him"".

After that she said that I was treating her poorly, she doesnt deserve this and she never spoke like this to her mom. We started arguing and I said that everytime i make decisions in any topic she just disagrees for the sake of disagreeing, she ignored and we continued to argue until she ran out of arguments and just ended the discussion.

This happened today, but it's an exemple of something that happens constantly, and every time ends in two ways: she runs out of arguments or i run out of patience and end the discussion frustrated, but i always feel like I'm the worst son cause i know i shouldn't be blowing up like this, but at the same time i don't think I'm wrong for being frustrated when I'm being ignored. Am i crazy and blowing things out of proportion? because at the end she always looks sad and disrespected.

74,1cjfv4l,AITA for reporting my neighbors dog for barking,"I live in an apartment building in NYC. It's an older concrete building with no insulation so you can hear a lot, but generally it's not too bad and I've been fortunate enough to have some great neighbors...with the exception of one. My neighbor got two new dogs about 1.5 years ago--a german shepherd and a beagle. They bark a lot--mostly the beagle. I actually took the time to track it for a few days and every time there was some barking, I marked down the minute--whether it was one bark or multiple. Most days, I have 40+ minutes marked down throughout the day.

To make it worse, we also share a balcony with a plastic divider in between. It's off of our living room with a few windows that I keep open when the weather is warm and nice. For whatever reason, she is in the habit¬†of leaving the balcony door open at various points throughout the day, year round and the dogs can come and go as they please. They (again, mostly the beagle) will bark at sirens, other dogs, me if I'm on the balcony, random things. Eventually, she may come to stop it and close the door, but 30 minutes, an hour, or some time later it will be opened again.

I spoke to her about this last spring because with my windows being open more, the barking was especially loud and annoying. I emphasized that we share a balcony and her dogs are basically barking 10 feet from my open window. She gave me a bunch of excuses, literally said the ol' ""well dogs bark"" line and told me she would do some things to try to make it better. It was actually a little better for about 2 months, but it eventually went back to the usual. I decided to just deal with it and get through the summer and just give it time.

This spring, nothing had changed and I found myself in the same situation. On top of that, she also started leaving the apartment with the balcony door open. After one Friday night when she was out and the dogs were going nuts for about 45 minutes, I contacted management. Since then, the situation has improved in that she hasn't left the apartment with the door open anymore and she's been a bit better about closing the door after they bark. However, she still often leaves it open and there will still be some barking. This past weekend, there was barking 10 different times throughout the day. The door would be opened, at some point the dog would bark, the door would be closed, rinse and repeat. I told this to management as well and they said the owner told them the issue was resolved and I must have been hearing someone else's dog (definitely not the case, I've heard her dogs bark every day for 1.5 years. I know what they sound like).

So, AITA for still complaining to management or should I just let it go since it is technically better than before?

This is the reason why I don't have a single friend or even a person I talk to, except my partner. Literally for years. Got so extreme I didn't even attempt to even sing or dance near my partner out of embarrassment killing me from the inside.

76,1cjedrk,AITA for not giving my brother money?,"I am a broke college student knee-deep in some debts, until this week. I got approved for a loan for financial aid so I can use that towards paying off my classes, and I got a major refund. 

I barely make $200 a week at my job and the debt to income ratio for me is outstanding. I live with my parents but I don‚Äôt ask them for money and help bc they do so much for me already and they‚Äôre pretty strapped too, so I have to be majorly independent on all this. I also live with my older brother.

This loan and major refund is a gift from God. I was able to pay off my school stuff plus personal things, and I even have a lot more money leftover so I transferred it to my savings account to not touch. Mind you before this: I had $0.50 to my name and no available credit on my credit card, so I needed this money BAD. 

No one knew anything about my refund besides my dad.

A couple days ago, my brother asks me for $100 to borrow and he‚Äôll pay back. I said no because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have anything right now‚Äú (I needed to created a budget with the money. I still have things to pay off, so I need to get my expenses out the way and calculate what I have left) He wanted it just for entertainment. If I told him about my refund he would‚Äôve hounded me for money.

Today, my parents are going on a trip. These next 10 days is my mom‚Äôs bday and Mother‚Äôs Day. After I made a budget, I realized I had some money for miscellaneous things so I gave them a gift of $500 for their trip just in case for anything and mentioned how I got a refund a couple days ago.

Minutes later my brother comes to me and is like ‚Äúyou have $500 to give them but not $100 for me?‚Äù And then he talks about how me and my older sister, is selfish.

I am a broke college student knee-deep in some debts, until this week. I got approved for a loan for financial aid so I can use that towards paying off my classes, and I got a major refund. 

I barely make $200 a week at my job and the debt to income ratio for me is outstanding. I live with my parents but I don‚Äôt ask them for money and help bc they do so much for me already and they‚Äôre pretty strapped too, so I have to be majorly independent on all this. I also live with my older brother.

This loan and major refund is a gift from God. I was able to pay off my school stuff plus personal things, and I even have a lot more money leftover so I transferred it to my savings account to not touch. Mind you before this: I had $0.50 to my name and no available credit on my credit card, so I needed this money BAD. 

No one knew anything about my refund besides my dad.

A couple days ago, my brother asks me for $100 to borrow and he‚Äôll pay back. I said no because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have anything right now‚Äú (I needed to created a budget with the money. I still have things to pay off, so I need to get my expenses out the way and calculate what I have left) He wanted it just for entertainment. If I told him about my refund he would‚Äôve hounded me for money.

Today, my parents are going on a trip. These next 10 days is my mom‚Äôs bday and Mother‚Äôs Day. After I made a budget, I realized I had some money for miscellaneous things so I gave them a gift of $500 for their trip just in case for anything and mentioned how I got a refund a couple days ago.

83,1cjd8i8,AITA for Prioritizing My Honeymoon Over My Parnters Sibling's Wedding?,"My partner and I got married recently, after planning our wedding for 2 years. During our engagement period, my partners sibling proposed to their fianc√©. They announced shortly after that they were planning a destination wedding, outside of our country, 4 months after our wedding. Before they had even confirmed their wedding date, we told them we would not be able to attend their wedding for a few reasons. The main one being that we have been planning our honeymoon to a different country a month after their proposed wedding date. Both my partners sibling and fianc√© said they understood if we would not be able to attend.

After our wedding, my partners family focus shifted to their siblings wedding. Even though we said months ago we would not be able to attend their wedding, all of a sudden it seems as though no one remembers that and keeps asking my partner if we are going. My partner has started to feel an overwhelming amount of guilt because they are afraid they are going to let their family down by not attending.

My partner and I got married recently, after planning our wedding for 2 years. During our engagement period, my partners sibling proposed to their fianc√©. They announced shortly after that they were planning a destination wedding, outside of our country, 4 months after our wedding. Before they had even confirmed their wedding date, we told them we would not be able to attend their wedding for a few reasons. The main one being that we have been planning our honeymoon to a different country a month after their proposed wedding date. Both my partners sibling and fianc√© said they understood if we would not be able to attend.

After our wedding, my partners family focus shifted to their siblings wedding. Even though we said months ago we would not be able to attend their wedding, all of a sudden it seems as though no one remembers that and keeps asking my partner if we are going. My partner has started to feel an overwhelming amount of guilt because they are afraid they are going to let their family down by not attending.

So it's not about any peer pressure or because of bullying. But I find myself gravitating towards the non-Indian side of my family, since they're a lot more relaxed and down to earth than the Indian side of my family, and I myself am a very relaxed person who breaks under pressure or stressful environments sinceI get overwhelmed and overstimulated very easily physically and emotionally nowadays.


Now I'm not saying I don't love the Indian side of my family, they're cool, chill, close to home but yet I find it so hard to not get overwhelmed around them since they expect me to be on the same level of enthusiasm and sharpness as they are when I haven't been exposed to much of Indian culture since my birth. Despite all this I have remained accepting and open to my Indian side.


But this has been going on recently, my mother, who is where I get this Indian side from, has always been a nice, calm and friendly person who I vibe with very well and I never see her pushing her Indian side onto me or my siblings. However recently, my mother has begun to act more sharp, strict and uses her mother tongue around the house - which she has never used this often before, since I have never properly learnt it or practiced it - and she proceeds to get angry and scold me when I fail to understand her. She goes back to nearly her old self when she is alone with me and my dad in the house, but around our extended relatives she somehow feels this need to express authority over me and my siblings, as if trying to feed into the typical Indian mother stereotype where her children follow her every order flawlessly, she has begun to comment more and more about my weight an imperfections in front of her relatives, as if to express how disappointed she was in me. I lost it when she began to scream at me about how I needed to fit into traditional clothing and how me being on the overweight side would bring me shame and then proceeded to not listen to me about my own boundaries and asked me to show more skin while wearing traditional clothing. I yelled back at her and I feel like such an asshole, but I was getting so overwhelmed with it and I couldn't handle it anymore.


I don't understand what has happened or why she is doing this now, but I want to completely ignore the Indian side of my heritage because of this.

93,1cjaur6,AITA for giving my brother a month to get his act together?,"(TL;DR at the end) 

My mother sadly passed away 3 months before this post, and was in hospice care for some time before.

Since her admittance to hospice, I (25+M) have been the head earner in our house, supporting my father (70+M) and brother (20M college student).

  Even before our mother's passing, my brother would laze around, typical late-teen/young adult stuff like lying in bed and gaming past midnight. It could take him a week to do a load of laundry, including 3 days of nagging beforehand and even after doing it, he just dumps all the fresh-cleaned clothes on his bedroom floor, which looks like a pigsty and can't even be seen for the piles of clothes and rubbish.

  I hold the opinion that he is old enough to make his own decisions and should be responsible for his actions in and out of the house, so I leave it up to him how he keeps his room, but the truth of the matter is he has been spoiled rotten and has rarely had to lift a finger, so I have been having a hard time getting him to take initiative and use his eyes and mind around the public areas of the house (laundry, dishes, even throwing out empty food packets that he has emptied). I've tried both hard and soft methods to get him to use initiative, but neither have worked for various reasons.

  Recently, I took a short trip abroad to clear my head, leaving father and brother with instructions, plenty of food and essentials, knowing all that they would need was more food, which would be cheap enough to get. I got home late, and when I got up the next morning, it was to find the house in a mess. Empty food packets, hardly any food at all, really, trash full, no liner in the general waste bin and mould in the green compost waste. Empty saucepans were piled up on the stove and crumbs were everywhere. What was more, I soon found one of our laundry drying racks was broken at the base and would not stand up. Both denied knowing how it happened, but I know my father is always honest with me, so I suspect my brother, because I knew it had been alright when I left.

  Now, grief I understand, but even in my grief I have been balancing a new job with running the house (buying food, cooking, cleaning, etc.), and I need my brother to start taking even a little responsibility because I can't do everything in the house and work full-time, and my father is a bit too old to be doing so, though he helps in his ways, but brother doesn't seem to understand. With that in mind, shortly after the drying rack debacle and in a slight temper, I gave my brother an ultimatum; one month to start pulling his weight or he finds another roof, as I am tired of dealing with his mess and I'd rather he made a place of his own a pigsty. Again, though, he is a college student living off grants and hardly pays rent.

Well my dad who was serving 10+ years in jail for profiting off of drugs got out in 2021 and the year he got out we went and moved in with him and my grandmothers house (his mom). To keep it short and simple it was the worse year of my life. My mom and dad were highly abusive and would always come at one of their kids at the same time like tag teaming. But then a miracle happened and my dad went back to jail because my mom had turned him in for a DUI because she didn‚Äôt wanna be with him anymore. (That‚Äôs a whole other story) so we stayed with my grandma but ended up moving out after my mom got an apartment ‚Äúfor us‚Äù.

I never really held a grudge against my mom for the things she did because she was sane and would make it up to us idk how but I was never mad at her for the things she did until this year.

My brother buys his girlfriend the same engagement ring I wanted because our mom often goes into that jewelry store and my brother knows I said I wanted it when I got married and he got it for his girlfriend who said it was pretty when they went to pick it out.

I am really hurt because having the same ring as my sil is dumb and I asked my brother to take it back but he said no and he‚Äôs getting married first and told me I never can hold down a man or be wife material because I toxic and crazy and this is the reason why I will never be married.

I was so upset and was crying so hard about it and my mom told me to hush and grow up that I don‚Äôt even have a boyfriend and the men I date can‚Äôt even afford the ring anyways because my baby daddy doesn‚Äôt even pay me support for my 7 year old.

Everyone knows this ring was special to me except maybe my brother‚Äôs girlfriend because she literally never even pays attention to me or her niece.

Last year, my whole friend group got into the game Final Fantasy XIV. A girl I know got me into it and I, upon falling in love with the game, introduced a guy I know to it. This guy seemed to enjoy the game but quickly began to complain about spoilers. These early spoilers were things that were easy to avoid - us referencing future characters in text chats he could see, sending screenshots of future areas, etc. and as such we quickly accommodated him by moving these spoilers to private chats.

However, over time the spoilers he complained about grew more difficult to avoid and everybody around him has grown increasingly annoyed. It has gotten to the point where he would get angry with me and be audibly frustrated at the mere mention of the name of a future dungeon. A few nights ago, I mentioned while he was around that a wall in a different medium kinda looks like a wall in the dungeon ‚ÄúPagl‚Äôthan‚Äù (a name which as far as I know is meaningless out of context and never mentioned in the game until you unlock the dungeon itself). He immediately interjects, saying ‚ÄúNice, dude,‚Äù in an extremely passive-aggressive tone, and that was the end of that conversation.

Last night, things kinda reached a boiling point. We were doing something completely different and he mentioned how he was considering recording himself playing through the rest of the game because we would spoil things whenever we played with him. I asked him what these ‚Äúspoilers‚Äù were and he explained that we spoiled things by saying things like ‚ÄúOh I love the music in this boss fight‚Äù or getting excited when he was nearing major cutscenes. At that point, I gave up and told him that he shouldn‚Äôt bother recording it and to just not talk about the game with us; that it made everybody else feel like he‚Äôd rather do anything than just simply play a video game with us.

We then moved on from the topic, but it has kinda stuck with me.

At that time she was living with her friend, they were cost sharing the expenses including rent. At the end of last year when we were going home for holidays (December), she told my sister that she won't be paying rent and will move out once we come back from holidays (January). My sister was not happy since the reason she agreed to move into this particular house in the first place was because the friend said the rent would be split into two so it won't be that much for my sister but now the friend has backed out and now my sister has to pay the full rent by herself (the rent to this place was high).

108,1cj70qf,AITA for excluding my daughter in law from our Bridgerton watch party?,"Posting on a throwaway to avoid family finding this.

So I (F53) have 3 children, Caleb (M26), Kate (F24) and Madison (F19). We are a very close family and we tend to do a lot together. Caleb got married last year to Ashley (F25). We really like her. We are as close to her as she lets us get. By that I mean, that we treat her like family and invite her to everything, but she usually only decides to join us every third time or so. She is an only child and close with her parents, so we accommodate holidays around her schedule.

Before Caleb and Ashley got married, her MOH threw her a bridal shower. They chose the same weekend as our family reunion. Kate and I skipped the family reunion to go to the shower, but the rest of the family did not.  Since our family missed the shower, I decided to throw her another, surprise shower and invited all our family that missed the shower, her mom and the bridal party. I chose a tea party theme. The shower went well, I thought, but as people were leaving, I overheard Ashley thanking her friends for being good sports about the lame tea party. She never complained to me directly, but it did hurt my feelings.

Last month, my daughters and I went to get pedicures, and invited Ashley, but she declined. We were talking about the Bridgerton release coming up and planned a watch party. We're having an afternoon tea. Madison asked if Ashley was coming, but I said no because Ashley doesn't like Bridgerton or tea parties - the last watch party we had for Queen Charlotte, we invited her and she left after about an hour and a half through the show. She said she just couldn't get into it. 

During this, DH is going out to a poker night and he invited Caleb. When Caleb asked Ashley about it, he found out we hadn't invited her to watch with us. He called me up and yelled at me. I told him that I didn't invite her because she doesn't like tea parties and that she doesn't like Bridgerton. He said that didn't matter, I should have invited her anyway. I called Ashley, apologized to her, and told her that we didn't invite her because she doesn't like the show, and she just responded, ""you're right, I don't."" So I just changed the subject and asked if we were doing Mother's Day the same schedule as usual. She said yes. But then, because I still hadn't invited her, Caleb called and said they weren't coming to mother's day at all and that I was being a jerk for excluding her.

Here's where I MBTAH. I don't want her to come and that's why I'm not inviting her. She was distracting when we watched Queen Charlotte, making comments about things she didn't like about the show, and giving us dirty looks when we were goofing around in British accents. She declined any tea, and just fidgeted until she left. I don't want to have to worry if she thinks it's lame or that we're being silly, or if she is enjoying herself.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-03,"AITA for not wanting to let ex room mate move back in, making them homeless? Hey all. So last week, I (35 autistic male) an acct here ton mention how when I was out, my former room mate (32 m)smashed my xbox series s to find ""government cameras"". 

Neighbors heard noise, called cops.

Now depsite rude comments in my other thread, he wasnt on meth or crack or anything harder than occasional pot, and only made references of Govt conspiracies, not being in them.

  
I have been telling prosecutor, judge, public defender & even former room mate, i dnt want him jailed. Just mental health services and im good.

  
They reached an agreemenr where he will go to at least 2 weeks in patient in the serious ward,, mental health check involantary types, then can be demoted to regular inpatient for 2 more weeks w evaluation. 

  
Medicine if necessary. 

  
He didnt thank me for helping him avoid jail when he called from Lourdes, he did offhand mention he cant afford to replace my xbox bc of fines from being arrested/possible meds, buthe TOTES will at some pt. He then, in same breath, asked if he could move in ""just for 2 or 3 months "" while he works and saved money, otherwise he will be homeless

117,1cj4x0x,AITA for not lying for my bf?,"
A few months ago, we were leaving a friend's house after he'd been there all day and I had only been there a few hours. His friend had definitely been drinking, I had not, don't know about bf. I did see him take a bowl hit, as did I. When we left to go, bf was mad at his best friend for ""grabbing"" at me while the three of us were on the couch. We all decided I should drive. But when I tried to drive his truck I was having a hard time. He was irritated and wanted to get out of there so he told me, let me back us out of the driveway and then you can drive.
Well, no sooner had we driven just a little ways in front of his friend‚Äôs house when he hit a wet spot in the road and we spun out of control, leaving the truck in a tree/ditch.

 Long story short - the friend suggested I say I was driving when the cops came, since I hadn't drank. I did at first, but they told me they had video footage of him driving. I cracked and gave him up. I have a record (not for dui) and was scared. He refused a breathalyzer. Which he could legally do, but he crashed his truck.

So flash forward to now. He was still charged with a dui, has to have a breathalyzer in his car before starting it up, and is going through a huge mountain of problems related to the dui, mostly financial. No money, has to pay out the ass for basic stuff, takes time from work to take care of dui related things, etc.

I am starting to feel guilty. Like I made a bad choice that messed up his life. I'm starting to feel like he's mad at me and blames me.

I don't think I had as much to lose as he did because I could have insisted I was driving and insisted they give me the breathalyzer. I would have passed with flying colors. Now I have a miserable bf who is making my life miserable and making me question everything. I was going to break up with him after this happened, for even asking me to lie for him, but I didn't feel right about that.

Did I do the right thing in turning him in? Or AlTA for basically setting him up?

I did see him take a bowl hit, as did I. When we left to go, bf was mad at his best friend for ""grabbing"" at me while the three of us were on the couch. We all decided I should drive. But when I tried to drive his truck I was having a hard time. He was irritated and wanted to get out of there so he told me, let me back us out of the driveway and then you can drive.
Well, no sooner had we driven just a little ways in front of his friend‚Äôs house when he hit a wet spot in the road and we spun out of control, leaving the truck in a tree/ditch.

 Long story short - the friend suggested I say I was driving when the cops came, since I hadn't drank. I did at first, but they told me they had video footage of him driving. I cracked and gave him up. I have a record (not for dui) and was scared. He refused a breathalyzer. Which he could legally do, but he crashed his truck.

So flash forward to now. He was still charged with a dui, has to have a breathalyzer in his car before starting it up, and is going through a huge mountain of problems related to the dui, mostly financial. No money, has to pay out the ass for basic stuff, takes time from work to take care of dui related things, etc.

I am starting to feel guilty. Like I made a bad choice that messed up his life. I'm starting to feel like he's mad at me and blames me.

I don't think I had as much to lose as he did because I could have insisted I was driving and insisted they give me the breathalyzer. I would have passed with flying colors. Now I have a miserable bf who is making my life miserable and making me question everything. I was going to break up with him after this happened, for even asking me to lie for him, but I didn't feel right about that.

Did I do the right thing in turning him in? Or AlTA for basically setting him up?

Back in 2016 my mother knew that I was gay because of a story i posted and she asked me directly and I said yes. She was angry and cant accept it because Im her only son and she doesnt want a gay son. We fought and didnt speak with each other for a month. Then 2017 I went to abroad to be with her because she had an operation and I needed to be there to take care of her and also find a job. 



However, recently I got a boyfriend that is serious(I have been hooking up here and there for the past years with multiple guys).I havent told her about it in full since she still doesn't accept me. Then she saw us in mall walking and she asked who he is, I told my boyfriend she looked badly and went without saying a word. After that we fought again, and recently I went to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend, and me and mom agreed to celebrate it the day after and eat in a buffet. Suddenly on my birthday she was not talking to me. I didnt ask her but I knew something was off. The following day she told me we needed to talk later in an angry manner. I snapped back and told her why later and not now. Then she angrily told me that why Im spending my birthday with my boyfriend and not with her, she basically told me again that she raised me,etc(Asian moms).I told her that we had already talked about it,we agreed that we would celebrate the next day. She started saying that I'm an ungrateful son and belittling me and my boyfriend since we are gay. Telling that he is just with me for the money and don't love me, that I will not find true love. Then I told her that my boyfriend paid half of her ticket going home since i can't cover it anymore. She even sarcastically said that he has money and wants to meet him to ask him in his face. I told her I would not give her the chance again to disrespect him. Then she justified her non acceptance of my sexuality by stating that even our relatives in US that are rich doesn't accept their son because he is gay, i cut her and told her so she wouldn't also? Then she started saying that if I leave her she will put me in court or police station to oblige me to pay her rent and even tell to police to arrest me because I‚Äôm gay. I'm so mad and fed up with her.

I really don't know what to do, think and feel now. Whenever I see her, I remember everything and get traumatised. She is trying to talk again like nothing happened. Trying to reel me in again with self-pity talks and when I tell her the words she told me she keeps quiet. I told her it's 8 years already that you knew and still you are saying you can't accept it and it's very hard for her to have a gay son.

My boyfriend is not meddling with this issue, he even told me to forgive her and talk to her since she is my mom, but how can I settle things with her if I know she doesn't accept for who I am but rather just the investment plan she raised.

They usually do three songs. One ""fully"" clothed. One topless. And one nude. Then there are stripper games to win posters me magnets and what have you. 

Since they are nude for the last song and the stripper games they have a stripper blanket. They are fleece blankets that keep them from leaving a snail trail across the stage. Usually they have an animal or waterfall or some shit printed on them. A tiger or a beach. You know. 

And they are sold at the side of the road from vans. Like an old Econoline Van will set up a pop up store for knives, pipes, bongs, and stripper blankets.

I was visiting my brother and his wife had a stripper blanket. And they keep their house cold AF. So she wanders around the house wrapped in it.

I did. She asks me to explain. So I do. Then she throws the blanket at me and starts screaming for my brother. 

I guess he got it for her last time he came up for a visit. Because it has a unicorn and a rainbow on it. Her favorite things.

My mom treated my dad pretty terribly afterward. She called him a thug and all kinds of shit because of his appearance and tried to chase him off by suing for child support despite them sharing equal parenting time of us.

My mom got married when I was 7 and within a few months she had another daughter, my half sister. This is where shit started to get stressful for my brother and me. My mom and her husband (I don't and will not call him my stepdad) weren't doing as great as they expected. I guess my mom got fired and when she got a new job it was demoted. Her husband's company lost a lot of money and paid less. My mom went back to court to ask for child support and got it. But it didn't make the difference she expected. Mom then started asking dad to buy gifts for my half sister's birthday and for Christmas. My dad told her he bought for his kids but not for a child she had with someone else. Mom would then tell my brother and me we needed to ask dad for gifts for our half sister. We'd say no and she'd start guilt tripping us. She'd say we're big siblings and we have it way better and if we love our half sister we should want her to be pretty equal to us.

It didn't stop there and my mom, even though dad never sent anything for my half sister, started thinking he should be willing to buy clothes and school supplies and random little treats because she knew he did that for us at his house. Mom was really hard on my brother and me because we didn't ask dad. My brother told her once that dad shouldn't have to pay when half sister has her dad. Mom said she's still part of our family though and we should feel guilty for having more than her. Out of spite a few years ago my mom told my half sister that dad had taken my brother to laser tag for his birthday and bought him a console and that I got to go to this cooking experience that cost like 500 dollars with my friends and that dad had bought me a gaming computer. She told my half sister we never asked him to buy her stuff too and that we didn't want her to have nice things. She was like 8 at the time. It was fucked up. My mom's husband was just as much of a jerk about it and he would get mad at us for not taking care of our half sister like that. He even threatened to steal us and leave the country to teach us and dad a lesson because clearly he was a better parent than dad.

I stopped going to mom's a few months ago, before turning 18 but close enough to it that she'd be too late getting back to court. I don't stay in touch much either but she blasted me for not visiting for my half sister's birthday and started off the guilt trip again so I called her out and told her she sucked and was an awful person and parent for treating my brother and me like that.

While I was screaming, I ran towards the stairs to close them before my youngest could reach it. Then I saw my hushand in the bathroom on his phone. I asked him: did you hear me? He told me no, he didn‚Äôt. So I explained to him what happened. 

I asked my husband: Hushand, could WE please be more alert in the future? I told him I was pretty shaken up and scared because of these incidents. My husband said he felt I was attacking him. He said that he was on the toilet, and when he walked away he expects me to keep an eye on the kids and for them to be safe. That he didn‚Äôt hear me. I told him: yes its my responsibility, i don‚Äôt blame you because you were in an other room. But for instance yesterday, i was away while u were watching the kids in the tub. I also expect you to be alert and watch them. My husband told me: yes for that instant, but for today I expect you to keep them safe. I told him: I don‚Äôt blame you, i get you were in an other room, but I called you a few times and u told me u didn‚Äôt hear me and u were on your phone. He told me he doesn‚Äôt like what i am implying and that he feels i am attacking him. Mayby it was because of the stress but i just started crying. I feel so helpless and unheard. I just wanted to warn my husband that WE BOTH need to be more alert. Never did i blame him. Husband says he doesn‚Äôt like the way I bring the message. He feels I am attacking and blaming him. My husband was acting like I was the Asshole. So am I? Mayby I should had asked in a more nicer way.. idk.",0.0,0.9623176455497742,1,0
125,1cj39c8,WIBTA for not giving my mom access to my Olympics pass?,"I (25F) was lucky enough to win an Olympic pass - basically, aVIP access to almost any Olympic event I want. Before I knew the details, my mom (55F) asked me if I would be able to give her my seat for a tennis final (she's a huge fan), and I told her if I was able to, I would.

Now, it turns out that the pass is name specific - I even had to send my ID for registration. My mom and I do have the same last name and look kinda similar, even if the age difference is noticeable, so she has been asking me to lend her my pass anyways. I do think it could work, so I told her I'd do it. It falls right after her birthday, so it's be a great gift and she literally breathes tennis, so she was extatic.

However, I was at a wedding the other day, and my mom kept pestering me for pictures. I sent her a few, and she immediately commented on my body. It's something she does often, and I'm used to carefully selecting the pictures I send her to avoid the most frequent criticism, but I guess she still found something to not be happy about. This time however, I decided to delete the pictures I had sent in retaliation, and not to answer a single text (she was begging me for more pictures, telling me she loved me and that I was beautiful). She's been pissed that I'm ghosting her, but I'm not budging on this, as I don't think she understood my point yet.

From my perspective, I baby my laptop like a new car (and personally I wouldn't give my car to anyone), my parents got it for me when I started uni and I'm infinitely grateful for that, it's a 1000$+ laptop and that's not easy money for us.

Today I (F33) had tons going on. We had an opening ceremonies for rec softball, 1 game at another field in town, a cheer showcase in the next town over, and then we rushed back to another softball game. It was busy and tiring but we had been looking forward to today for weeks. My kids are 13, almost 12, 9 and 6. We had a great afternoon, even with the busy chaos.

 My parents came to town from an hour away because they had the day off and typically can‚Äôt come for stuff during the week.
. My mom (not quite 50) has past family trauma and untreated anxiety. She can be hard to deal with. She‚Äôs never happy, always complaining and I feel like I‚Äôm on eggshells when she‚Äôs around. We were leaving the cheer event quickly to get back to a game. There was a spot in the entry of this school with 2 carpeted stairs going down to a landing. In our rush, my mom (2 steps in front of me) stepped wrong I guess and rolled in very slow motion down the steps and onto the landing. I was holding my little girl‚Äôs hand and it took me a second to process what happened. Once she landed she rolled over one more time and I thought in that split second she was trying to be funny and I did a quick giggle and went to go down these steps to her. She flipped out in front of a crowd and started crying and yelled at me that I giggled and didn‚Äôt rush to her super concerned in those few seconds. She was NOT hurt. She flipped out and stormed out of the building fast with my family behind her. I could see her talking shit to my dad the whole walk to the car. We get to the field and she‚Äôs very clearly still fuming as I‚Äôm trying to make small talk with my little girl to lighten the mood for her. She could sense it was tense. 

I asked my mom if she was ok and asked if she was sore. She again flipped out and started screaming at me in front of so many people watching games. They turned around and were watching which of course embarrassed me. I insisted I was sorry that a little giggle was my first split-second reaction. I do that when I‚Äôm uncomfortable etc. Again, this was done in front of my little kids. She stormed off again and made a spectacle. We had such a great night until then and I‚Äôm sad that put a damper on things. My little girls were stressed and worried. She eventually left and came back shortly after in dramatic fashion and just stood around crying with her arms folded for most of the game. She has a lot of untreated anxiety, which I do have sympathy for. But I‚Äôm also not going to beg for her forgiveness. I‚Äôm appalled at how she acted and sick of this cycle of shit. There‚Äôs a lot of history here.

Do we need a big wedding or will something with family do? etc.

a) I was surprised they hadn't considered this type of question before this point but that's fine, more importantly, b) I said I've given this question much thought over the years and decided that I don't need any kind of wedding, to me it's a tradition and it's symbolic and I wouldn't mind not having one. But at the same time, I know I'm probably in the minority there and that if I ever ended up with a partner that did want one, I'd be more than happy to take part in a big wedding and would enjoy it. I've expressed that if we do go down the big wedding route I'll whole heartedly buy in, and given there's a lot of money involved, promised unequivocally I'd never hold it against my partner in the future, its my decision too in agreeing to it.

That leaves us in a bit of a shit situation though, the decision lands entirely on my partner. And understandably they're feeling anxious about making such a big decision and it all being up to them.

133,1cj2er2,WIBTA for not waiting for my son to be able to buy my farm.,"Hello.

I, at age 62 decided to sell my farm because I live here alone and my health is not good enough anymore to keep up with all the work here.

I have 4 kids, let's call them Jake, Jennifer, Julia and Marcus (made up the names for privacy) 3 from my first marriage who are all over 30 and one from my second marriage who is 20 and in University.  
The first 3 kids grew up on the said farm and my eldest son Jake still visits me to help with heavier work like making firewood! Jake has a house, wife and kids so I don't want to inconvenience him too much.  
Girls live in the city and also both have a family.

My marriage with my second wife was quite short and after we divorced when Marcus was 7 and she got the main custody, I ended up as the weekend father.  
Marcus was never interested in farm work, machines or horses, he was the only one who did not have his own horse as he just did not care about it, so most weekends he played with the computer and slept through half the day.

The girls have helped me a lot too, our little tradition is ""spring works"" where we clean up the farm, paint what is needed and then have a bonfire after, we grill and hang out.  
Only kid who never takes part of it is Marcus, and last weekend when we did it was no different.  
This is the event where I told my kids my plans to sell and they supported the idea, as we might as well continue this tradition at Jake's place.

As Marcus was not here I called him and told my plan to sell.  
He was surprised and told me that he actually thought he would get the farm as he was going to get horses with his girlfriend and I just had to wait a few years after he was done with University and has a job.  
I explained to him that my health is not good enough to keep the house up for X amount of years until he could maybe buy it as I can't just give it to him either, I offered him I could gift him the money for the downpayment as I do love all my kids and apartment in the city is cheaper than the farm and my plan was to split rest of the money between the kids.

Now Marcus is really mad at me because he hoped I would sell it for a better price as farms that actually have stables and paddocks are very expensive and keep getting expensive every year, so the money for a downpayment might not be enough in a few years.  
I kinda pissed him off by telling him that I don't believe that he understands how much work keeping up a farm is as he has been a city kid his whole life, he has not once even mowed the lawn, imagine making hay and stuff.  
  
Yesterday I got a call from my ex who asked why I am discriminating against my kids, as I supposedly never gave that much attention to Marcus as to others and I am an asshole for selling the farm as I should give it to Marcus.  
(Which is kinda true, as the only way to spend more time with him when he was a teenager would've been to join him via computer probably?)

The problem is, where would I live...

134,1cj2dl6,AITA for getting mad at friend not inviting me to parties/wanting to hang out before leaving town?,"I (24m) have a friend (22f). We've known eachother for over 8 years now. I consider her a close and important friend.

She got a super nice job in a different city and decided to move there, so she organized some time to spend with different friends/family before she left.

I was looking forward to spend some time with her in one of those events/parties but I never got invited to one. During one of our conversations I asked: ""Do you want to hang out before you leave?""

To which she said: ""Oh I would love to, I really really want to, but I'm kinda broke right now and not feeling like socializing any more sorry, but I really want to!"" I accepted the answer.

Over the next days/weeks she kept mentioning her plans to hang out with friends/other people in our conversations and that made me feel a little sad, I thought she had no intention/desire to hang out but suddenly she's doing all these plans, to me it seems like she doesn't want to hang out with me.

I never mentioned anything but I feel like my friendship is not as important to her as I thought it was, it hurts because her friendship has been quite important to me over all these years and I feel like an idiot for thinking it was meaningful to her too.

Due to this I have been taking some distance and talking (texting) less. I think it doesn't matter that much anyways.

135,1cj2csh,AITA for helping someone who was getting harassed?,"I went out for a few drinks with my best friend last weekend. While we were at a bar I noticed one of my girlfriends friends at the bar with a guy who looked like he wasn't taking no for an answer.

I needed another drink so I went to the bar and I heard the guy keep trying to talk her into letting him get her a drink despite her repeatedly saying no. I went up to her and said hi and asked how she was. She seemed happy someone had came over and started talking to me. I asked if she wanted to join me and my friend and told her I'd order her a drink if she wanted to go and sit down. She agreed and went and sat at our table.

When I brought the drinks over she thanked me for stepping in and said the other guy had been bothering her for a while. She stayed for a couple of hours with us and had a few more drinks and then she wanted to head off home so I ordered her a taxi and made sure she got in the taxi okay.

The next morning my girlfriend seemed annoyed so I asked what was wrong. She mentioned that another friend of hers had messaged her to tell her I was sat drinking with her friend and it looked like we were getting on well. I tried to explain what had happened but she just said I was wrong for drinking with her friend.

I mentioned that I was doing her friend a favour and that I was doing nothing wrong. She just said I shouldn't be having drinks with other women and that it's disrespectful and that I was wrong for doing it.

For more information, i am the oldest of four kids 2b and 2g, my parents are near the age of 50( think of like 43 and 45). They always put more work on me and my sister since my bothers were born and as we got older the work load double, my brother dont even do chores aswell, neither do my parents, (my dad does help but hes busy doing my mom work job and studying for his PHD, so its quite rare).

For that my brothers did end up very entitled and enjoy bothering me especially when im busy, since im the oldest my parents do tell me i need to do more although i do the houseclean, like every room every day, (multiple times too sometimes) and make food everyday( tho they never fucking eat it), have to wake up and dress my siblings early morning)  yet im busy studying for my uni studies and not to mentioned i am chronically sick so i get sick and unable to do work very sometimes, (yet my mom does tell me im lying about being sick 80% of the time, tho im not).  So which made me hate kids, infact i fight with my younger brother (hes 6) everytime we intract because im so sick of dealing with kids since i turned 8 and having to raise them because my parents arent bothered to it themselves. 

So when i heard they were pregnant again, i was so livid and still am, because i know i will havr the o raise that child too since one, my parents are gonna be in the 50s soon, two they always make me, even back when i was a kid, three we are not rich especially since i am sick and my mom is still recovering from a brain tumor she had years ago removed. 

Edit: so i missed out some more information, but i dont have to option to move out, i live in a country where it is impossible to leave your parents house without getting married first, i have zero savings and no other family members to live with, my title came in a paragraph i accidentally deleted but i told my parents that would hate my sibling if they gave birth and that i am sick of them forcing me to raise my siblings when they didnt even bother helping me or raise me in the first place (my grandfather raised me until i was 8, because he sadly passed away)

Edit 2: since alot of the comments are repeated question of why i dont get a job or save money, the reason is i live in a sexist country where a female doesnt have that much freedom and even after shes married, however i did decide to apologise to my parents about my comment and try my best to apply to some student exchange or any type of visa to get out of the house and far away from my parents.

139,1cj1xb9,AITA for excluding someone from a group trip?,"I am currently working abroad on a rotation and sharing an apartment with 2 flatmates. I have invited some friends over the year but I'm conscious not to have too many people. My flatmates are actually dating so they're fairly self contained and don't mind me having friends over, within reason. 

For my birthday, 2 of my friends asked to come and visit me, which I said was fine. One of them asked to bring his girlfriend and then decided to get a hotel, which left me and the one friend. I have a double bed and an air mattress so we decided to invite another friend, who would sleep on the double bed, too. So, my friends who are the couple would get a hotel, and my other 2 friends would share the double bed, with me on the air mattress. 

A few days later, one of the friends staying with me said he'd invited *another* friend, because it came up in conversation that he'd be seeing me and he felt bad. This fifth friend, let's call him Jeff, is not one of my close friends. Don't get me wrong, I really like him, but I've met Jeff maybe 10 times in my life and it is my birthday weekend and wanted to share it with my closer friends, and it's more of the principle of my friends putting this on me because Jeff feels left out.

Jeff apparently really wants to come but will only come if he has somewhere to stay because hotels in my city are insane that weekend because of a concert (our couple friends got in early and used points so they're okay).

I want to say no but I feel awful. AITA? And any advice on how to resolve it?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-03,"AITA for excluding someone from a group trip? I am currently working abroad on a rotation and sharing an apartment with 2 flatmates. I have invited some friends over the year but I'm conscious not to have too many people. My flatmates are actually dating so they're fairly self contained and don't mind me having friends over, within reason. 

For my birthday, 2 of my friends asked to come and visit me, which I said was fine. One of them asked to bring his girlfriend and then decided to get a hotel, which left me and the one friend. I have a double bed and an air mattress so we decided to invite another friend, who would sleep on the double bed, too. So, my friends who are the couple would get a hotel, and my other 2 friends would share the double bed, with me on the air mattress. 

A few days later, one of the friends staying with me said he'd invited *another* friend, because it came up in conversation that he'd be seeing me and he felt bad. This fifth friend, let's call him Jeff, is not one of my close friends. Don't get me wrong, I really like him, but I've met Jeff maybe 10 times in my life and it is my birthday weekend and wanted to share it with my closer friends, and it's more of the principle of my friends putting this on me because Jeff feels left out.

Jeff apparently really wants to come but will only come if he has somewhere to stay because hotels in my city are insane that weekend because of a concert (our couple friends got in early and used points so they're okay). I was then left feeling extremely bad.

He asked me to handle more in terms of chore and I wholeheartedly agreed. I make a decent amount, but paying the full rent (even when split in half) was tough.
The bf got super busy with work (10 am - 11 pm tech job) and I pretty much do the majority of households after my 10 - 18 job. This includes laundry, cooking, washing the dishes, shopping, keeping stock of all the thing in the house, cleaning, and everything surrounding our dog.

We decided in the end that he was going to pay a bit more again when we relocate since he couldn‚Äôt contribute in any other way. He agreed, but grumbled ‚Äútaking my money again huh‚Äù, which I thought was very rude.

143,1cj14nh,AITA for confronting these two boys on my swim team because they were making g*y jokes about me,"I (m) is on my schools swim team and have been on for three years now. My friend (f) is also on the swim team for three years so we are very close. Last year one (m) (of two) boys joined the team and my friend dated him. That summer they broke up, then this year another boy (m) joined the team and dated my friend. They broke up half way through the year. 

After my friend and her ex broke up the boy went to the other ex and became friends. But me and my friend stayed friends. Needless to say they were (and still are) jealous that she moved on. So for the past month or two they have been talked shit about her. I didn‚Äôt involve myself and tired to be friends with them. They were cool with me at first but they saw that me and my friend still hang out so they came for me next. 

The main thing is that I do struggle with my sexuality and it‚Äôs a very touchy subject for me so I try to not bring it up. The thing is I am what they would call a person who gives the g*y vibe so it‚Äôs hard to get away from that. Needless to say they would make jokes that I walk g*y and that I should do some weird ass dances that obviously make me look g*y. They also said this all when I wasn‚Äôt paying attention so my friend told me what they said. I didn‚Äôt pay any mind to it until one day. 

Me and my friend were walking to the hot tub to hang and one of our other friend on the swim team came us to us and said that they said this about us ‚Äú(insert my name here) doesn‚Äôt f*ck her because he g*y‚Äù this made me very angry so I came up to them and confronted them and told them to fuck off and not to say shit like that. They told me they didn‚Äôt say that and they would never. I didn‚Äôt believe them so I walked off.

I am currently a SAHM waiting to finish school‚Ä¶.My partner works but also invests fully into his hobbies. He likes gaming, fishing, and hunting.

Every week its something different, right now we are finishing turkey season but it is only about 6 wks long. However, when its not turkey season then its fishing season and after that deer. When hes home, its gaming. He has calmed down on gaming but still does it now and then.

He invests hours every weekend to these outdoor activites. Usually 10-12 hrs a day. 
This all might not bother me that much if he was going out and actually catching things but so far he hasnt.. Except for fish. He says its taking a long time because he is teaching himself all of these things, but hes finally starting to get it. (His excuse is he thinks he needs to learn how to prepare and hunt in case we go to war).
This has also affected us financially. He has spent an upwards of 3,000 $ last year on deer stands, a new bow, new gear, a one seater kayak‚Ä¶ ect. (His excuse is they are investments that will last) 
We argued and i told him, that he gets to go out of the house and hang out with his friends every weekend while i watch the kids, but we have probably had one date this year. On top of that he doesnt want to make the plans to find a sitter for us to have date nights but will take all the time in the world to map out what spot would be better to hunt/fish, look at weather, practice his calls ect. 

I have told him this was inconsiderate he SAYS he will reach out and make the plans and effort but i havent seen any different.
He also has issues with me doing the same thing.He always thinks me going out with friends means going to a bar and drinking(since he doesnt drink he thinks this makes him a saint when he just hunts and doesnt go to bars). I rarely drink but i dont think 2 drinks maybe 3 on a night out is a big deal? He also thinks that id cheat on him if i go to a club/bar (ive never cheated in my life). His excuse is that i get whatever i want so i should be happy. The only things i did for myself recently are get my hair done( 1st time since 22‚Äô) and get my nails done (1st time in a year). We didnt have a lot of money so i was learning to do them at home and sacrificing that for my kids to have what they needed over me.

on to the issue. when she pulled into her driveway, she turned her head and asked the kids ""do you guys want to come inside for a minute or stay out here?""

147,1cj0fls,AITA for breaking promises to my girlfriend?,"I (21f) have been dating my girlfriend (‚ÄúJane‚Äù 21F) for two years. In the first months of our relationship, it became clear that we would have to be long distance for a while because of school (we are both uni students, though I'm a year ahead). Before we separated, she told me that she was looking for a serious, long term relationship and that to her that meant closing the distance at the earliest possible convenience. Since I was going to graduate before her, she asked if I was willing to come be where she was for a year while she finished her degree. At the time I was very infatuated with her, so I agreed to the idea quickly.

Prior to that, she‚Äôs told me about some pretty bad abandonment issues from her childhood. I repeatedly reassured her that I wasn't going anywhere, and that I would do anything to be with her. And once we agreed on a plan to eventually close the distance, I continued to make those promises. In an attempt to reassure her and win her heart, I made several long declarations that I would do anything to be with her, that she was my top priority, that I would make it work no matter what, etc.

The issue is, as the time came for me to look into jobs and grad programs near her, I found a cool program abroad. Studying abroad had been a childhood dream of mine, so I immediately started researching and planning how I would apply as soon as possible. When I told Jane about this, she got extremely upset. Apparently, she felt blindsided by this new plan since I had never mentioned or communicated a desire to go abroad prior to that moment, and she felt it was cruel for me to have made all those promises about wanting to be with her when I wasn't actually committed to the idea. She then reiterated that she did not want to do long distance for several more years and, while she supported me following this path, that she would no longer want to be in the relationship if that was what I chose. I told her that if that was the case, then I needed to think about what I actually prioritized. I didn't want to lose either, I didn't know what to do.

Now, Jane says that she feels lied to and that I should have either told her from the start that I wanted to travel after graduation or just kept the promises I made about waiting for her.

148,1cj0cnp,AITA for refusing to help in a family crisis,"For starters, I want to keep this as generic as possible, while also laying out the hard facts. My husband and I are in our mid 30s, we have a few teen/preteen kids, one driving and heavy in sports. We have been struggling as a family over the last several years as I have been very ill, and have been unable to work, do housework, cook, or pretty much anything. Through all of this, we have hardly asked for any help, because we do not want to burden anyone, but also, no one in either of our families have offered any help, and when asked for help it has been refused. To add to this, none of our family struggles are related to finances in any way, and we are very very fortunate in that aspect.

Now, to the ‚ÄúFamily Crisis‚Äù. A family member, George, who is a drug addict, married Beth, who also is a drug addict. Recently, I get a phone call from another family member, Sarah. During the phone call, I was informed that Beth just gave birth in their house, didn‚Äôt know she was pregnant, and it was crazy. A little skeptical, I asked what the plan was for the baby if drugs were involved. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt been on drugs.‚Äù Sure they haven‚Äôt. So, big surprise, Beth gets told that the baby can‚Äôt go home with them because of drugs in its system.

Sarah and Rick (her husband) have stepped up and taken custody of the baby until Beth and George can get cleaned up and do all of the CPS and court requirements. Now, when Sarah calls me to tell me this, the phone call ends with ‚Äúso go online and buy a bassinet and send it to my house‚Äù. I suggested that they reach out to NICU staff and social services, since often families that have babies tragically pass away will donate the baby items to social services and NICU for situations such as these where there is an immediate need for a newborn to be fostered. Apparently that was highly inappropriate, because how dare I suggest that they ‚Äúask for a handout‚Äù and ‚Äúas a family we can get everything it needs and take care of it‚Äù.

Now, we are the type of people that have always gone above and beyond to help out our family anytime help was needed, no matter what. We are financially secure, and family has often taken advantage of that fact in the past, with comments such as ‚Äúwell you can afford it‚Äù and ‚Äúthe cost isn‚Äôt that much for you‚Äù.

For context I'm an autistic (Level 2, moderate needs) teenager living in a smallish town with his Mom from the Philippines. Recently we began talking about the loneliness and the melancholy that comes with living in a island town. Going on about the sense of saudade and Sisyphean dread, having no one of our family in the town. Her reason for this is the work as a single mother who works as an cashier at one of the grocery stores and a retirement home worker. My main reasons are quite complex, to not able to get a girlfriend to not to able to visit and hang out with friends as much. I had a friend once, which I visited hi one time, and he left the town for college.

It was April 29th, just gotten back from school. My Mom then said to me in my bedroom that we are leaving at June 1th. I didn't have time to process, we have to be there at the town's airport restaurant by 4, for a family friend. On the short car ride there I had a meltdown, I was able to control my self yet I raised my voice at her. Voicing my discomfort, for not having *my idea* of a summer within the summer away from school. Once there was able to calm myself down, had to go to the bathroom which was luckily empty. Didn't contribute much to the conversation, focused on dealing with my inner emotions.

Once we got home, I questioned what if anything made her think that I wanted to go to the Philippines early, (usually we go at august). I had plans for future friendships or lack thereof, in the summer, and yes I was in simpler terms ""sad"", but I hadn't said verbally that ""Yes I wanted to go to the Philippines."" Turns out, she thought that I indirectly asked for it, relaying the same types of dread. Thinking that I have indirectly transmit such. The *double empathy* problem folks.

Tomorrow morning (the 30th) we talked about it on the dining table. We agreed upon July, since that will give enough time for my Mom to heal, and my summer time here in this town. Extra, she'll able to keep her job over at the retirement home and I'll be able to get work.

Yet I had this gut feeling that I have overstep my boundaries, that I've inadvertently manipulated her. Was I ""communicating my needs"" as my Mom had put it, or communicating my wants and selfish desirers? I am projecting the concept of death into an innocent vacation? Just only so I can squander the brought product on making money and trying to have friendships? Not having the summer to myself is a temporal discomfort, yet something that I realistically can get over? Lets be really here, this summer is the last I will spend as a legal minor, might as well make the best of it. Turning 17 soon.  Am I the asshole?

TL;RD: Had an autistic meltdown over about my Mom's original plan to go to the Philippines on June the 1st. Talked Mom into rescheduling our trip to the Philippines towards July. Unsure it I did it for my own mental health/needs or I was being selfish wanting to spend some of the summer break in the town.

For context I'm an autistic (Level 2, moderate needs) teenager living in a smallish town with his Mom from the Philippines. Recently we began talking about the loneliness and the melancholy that comes with living in a island town. Going on about the sense of saudade and Sisyphean dread, having no one of our family in the town. Her reason for this is the work as a single mother who works as an cashier at one of the grocery stores and a retirement home worker. My main reasons are quite complex, to not able to get a girlfriend to not to able to visit and hang out with friends as much.

I love my brother and I have money to pay him for the trip, neither of us are exactly hurting financially. About a year or so ago he proposed to his then gf, but was a little short on funds for the ring. I helped him out with a portion of it and to be fair he did disclose he didn‚Äôt know when he‚Äôd pay it back since he would be in between jobs. I agreed because it was a big moment and I didn‚Äôt want him to stress too much and he also helped me out with some funds that year when I was waiting on the sale from my house which I then paid him back immediately on. 

We did go on a trip recently ( me brother and sis n law) since they were nice thoughtful enough to include me in and I paid for my room, some drinks and food and part of the airplane ticket, all of which adds up to a third of what he owes me. I didn‚Äôt book the airplane ticket but apparently I only paid for half of it and now he‚Äôs asking for the other half. I feel like it‚Äôs not the money that matters but the principal. It‚Äôs been well over a year since I let him borrow those funds and I‚Äôve never pestered him about it, but idk AITA for being a little bit bothered by this?

155,1cizajn,AITA My friend canceled going to prom with me last minute because she didn‚Äôt like her custom dress. We booked makeup up appointments and I‚Äôve bought all my item‚Äôs already.,"
She randomly just texted in our friend group chat that she isn‚Äôt going to prom and that she will only go to after prom. Someone asked her why and she said she didn‚Äôt like her custom dress, and that the lady messed it up.

 I was upset but she‚Äôs the type of person to cancel or be late to things all the time so I didn‚Äôt expect her to commit to the plan, and she recently talked about not wanting to go. But we already said no matter what we would just end up going and that if she didn‚Äôt like her dress she had a back up dress. Later she was complaining abt the back up dress not fitting her though. Anyways me and another friend asked her to see the dress after what she said and she didn‚Äôt respond to us. The next day the group chat fills with more messages and later she responds to those.

 I just think it‚Äôs so irritating that she didn‚Äôt address me personally about how she‚Äôs not going to prom because she knows I‚Äôve bought my dress, booked my makeup appointment for $68. Only 3 ppl in our friend group were gonna go including me, her and our other friend. Although my other friend is very outgoing and has so many friends, if I went to prom with her I‚Äôd just feel awkward following her around. And apparently at after prom ppl dress in casual clothes so I would have got my dress for no reason if I ended up up not going. I am considering going because I bought everything already and my dress is absolutely gorgeous on me. It‚Äôs the next day after she announced she‚Äôs not going. I want to send a pic in the group chat of me in my dress and I‚Äôm just curious to see what she‚Äôd say.

156,1ciz8j2,AITA for going on a trip with one bestfriend and not the other because she can‚Äôt afford it?,"I have 2 very close friends (A and B), we are all about 20 y.o and work part time or casual. The three of us basically go to any activity/ social event together.
Recently, myself and B had spoken about going on an overseas trip, we mentioned this idea to A and she said it sounded so fun but made a comment about not being able to afford it. We were both expecting her to say this because we know that she doesn‚Äôt have any money saved and works minimal shifts. This isn‚Äôt something that is a problem in our friendship as both myself and B understand that and we often cater our activities, dinners, etc. to not be overly expensive to include A. Occasionally A will opt out of an activity because she cannot afford it. 
So B and I had decided at this point that we really did want to go on this trip and we have started planning and looking at accommodation/ flights etc. The other night B asked A about the trip again and she again said she can‚Äôt afford it, so B asked what she would think if we went on the trip without her. A then proceeded to get extremely angry and said that she would never speak to us again if we went and basically just said we would be horrible friends if we did. 
This trip is going to cost us about 5-6k each so unfortunately we can‚Äôt pay for her share so she is able to come. And if we were to wait for her to be able to afford it, it would be at the very least over a year (probably more like 2) before she would have the money. And because we are young our situations are likely to change by then and I may be working full time or saving to move out and not be in the position to go then, so I am pretty set on going now as it is the perfect time. I‚Äôm also happy to go on another trip later when she can afford it if i‚Äôm also in the position. However her main issue is that the two of us (B and myself) are going together without her, but there is no one else I would go away with besides these two friends. 
We haven‚Äôt told her yet that we are actually going (she just thought this conversation was an idea) and i‚Äôm honestly so scared to tell her because she‚Äôs gonna flip out and it will end in an argument and possibly the end of our friendship according to her.
