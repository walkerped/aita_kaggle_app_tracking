0,1ck3m7p,AITA for refusing to let my sister and her friends stay over at my house because they were rude to me?,"context m28 lives alone in an apartment with 3 bedrooms. Last year I let my f22 sister and her friends stay over as they needed accommodation for a night as they are attending a concert in my city. 

&#x200B;

They didn't mess anything up in my apartment. 

&#x200B;

However my apartment walls are thin I can hear everything in the room they are staying in especially their gossips and my sister's friends had horrible things to say about me like ""you're brother is so ugly, cant believe you got all the good genes"" or ""he looks autistic and a socially awkward inccel"" (Because I'm lanky and wear glasses - still working on it üòÇüòÇ). Also making fun of my OCD and tics. 

&#x200B;

My sister barely defended me saying ""shhh he's giving us a free stay"".

&#x200B;

But yeah sticks and stones but considering I'm giving them a place free to stay for a night it kinda rubs me the wrong way. But I didn't kick them out and let them stay the whole night.

&#x200B;

Additionally I picked all of them up from the airport and dropped them off and none of them were even appreciative for me driving them or letting them stay over. Not even a thank you, like even a 'thank you' would make me turn a blind eye to the gossiping.

&#x200B;

Now this year the similar concert is happening, but I refused to let them stay over. And this bugged my sister off a lot with her calling me a petty inccel over small issues.

&#x200B;

Am i the petty asshole in this?

1,1cjr3t2,AITA for calling the cops on my ex‚Äôs donor conceived daughter?,"Around early March I received an email asking for details about my ex, which I thought as a front to advanced credit card scams and ignored. Then I got more emails with more details about the girl‚Äôs situation and I forwarded them to my ex, telling him to deal with her. 

However, over time she has found my work phone and called me there, which isn‚Äôt hard to find but definitely stalker behavior. She called me three times before I had her number blocked. I did talk to her on the phone the first time and told her not to contact me, that I do not want her in my kids‚Äô lives. 

My wasband says it was an anonymous donation he made in uni for money and I believe him. We are not divorced but on and off and he is still a very much a part of my life (and his real children‚Äôs.) She has tried to contact him before me and he told her stop initiating contact, he would‚Äôve picked known donor but he wanted to be anonymous. 

We also looked her up in various ways and we do not want to associate with her any further. I thought she was reasonable at first but I do not think she is right in the head anymore. 

The last straw was a week ago when she showed up to my place. Luckily my kids were in day care and the only people at home were me and my ex who was visiting. He recognizes her and goes out to tell her to leave, but she starts screaming and crying and it was a proper mess so he comes back inside. She knocks on the door but I had locked it and I tell her leave or ill call the police. Please leave.  Etc 

Let‚Äôs just say she lives very far away. She had no innocent reason to be there.  It was very concerning to see her car there and then her insane behavior when approached. 

Now she is trying to ‚Äòexpose‚Äô us on her public instagram account. She does not have followers, but she did include my full name and work address which I reported to instagram and the station nearby who sent the cops i called on her.

9,1cjqaxt,AITA for rejecting my BFs new birthday plans after the old plans were cancelled?,"A month back, my BF(25M) purchased tickets to see a ballet that wasn‚Äôt originally intended to be for my(22F) birthday but we both agreed we‚Äôd go together as a birthday event since it would fall near the date, under the condition I pay back for at least half of my ticket price. We also agreed to go to karaoke with some friends. 

The friends ended up cancelling the karaoke. It later turned out that I also needed to undergo a tooth procedure only two days before the ballet. The dentist told me my face would be swelling for a few days and advised I stay home, so I told my boyfriend I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. He was pretty sad about the cancellation, but managed to convince his mother to come instead. 

Well, it turns out I had almost no side effects after the procedure, and would be in a perfectly fine state to go to the ballet. But when I brought up how perfectly fine I felt, my BF admitted he would‚Äôve loved to bring me but it was too late now because his mother was excited for the ballet, and changing his mind on her would be discouraging. Fair enough. I left it alone at the time.

The day before the ballet, he was showing me his texts with his mom about their conversations about the event and I noticed that she had said if I feel fine, my BF should let her know if I would like to take back my ticket. At this point it felt fair for me to get my ticket back, but I didn‚Äôt want to push it, so I just said ‚Äúit would be pretty nice if I could still go but I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel bad about it‚Äù. He continued to insist that it was too late because it would disappoint her.

So the morning of the ballet, I asked if there could be some sort of compromise for me missing out on the ballet as that was the only remaining thing we had planned for my bday. I‚Äôll admit I was a bit upset considering for Christmas and Valentine‚Äôs day we didn‚Äôt really do much, and I never received a gift when I had gotten one for him.

He immediately got angry saying it wasn‚Äôt his fault I couldn‚Äôt go and that it seemed like I was attacking him for not taking me to the ballet, which was not my intention at all. We then got into an argument about how it didn‚Äôt seem like he was that invested in our plans for my birthday at this point. It just felt disappointing considering he‚Äôs so willing to come up with plans with other people (albeit he doesn‚Äôt see them nearly as often as we see each other) but it has to feel like a chore to come up with things to do together. 

He later gave in and found a show we could go to after I hinted at it, but to me it feels like he only did that out of pressure. I have a feeling if I never brought it up, we would‚Äôve ended up doing nothing. He tells me he‚Äôs disappointed too and wants my birthday to be special, but it seems like this guilty expression was only because I had a reaction to it considering his nonchalance about it before.

A month back, my BF(25M) purchased tickets to see a ballet that wasn‚Äôt originally intended to be for my(22F) birthday but we both agreed we‚Äôd go together as a birthday event since it would fall near the date, under the condition I pay back for at least half of my ticket price. We also agreed to go to karaoke with some friends. 

The friends ended up cancelling the karaoke. It later turned out that I also needed to undergo a tooth procedure only two days before the ballet. The dentist told me my face would be swelling for a few days and advised I stay home, so I told my boyfriend I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. He was pretty sad about the cancellation, but managed to convince his mother to come instead. 

Well, it turns out I had almost no side effects after the procedure, and would be in a perfectly fine state to go to the ballet. But when I brought up how perfectly fine I felt, my BF admitted he would‚Äôve loved to bring me but it was too late now because his mother was excited for the ballet, and changing his mind on her would be discouraging. Fair enough. I left it alone at the time.

The day before the ballet, he was showing me his texts with his mom about their conversations about the event and I noticed that she had said if I feel fine, my BF should let her know if I would like to take back my ticket. At this point it felt fair for me to get my ticket back, but I didn‚Äôt want to push it, so I just said ‚Äúit would be pretty nice if I could still go but I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel bad about it‚Äù. He continued to insist that it was too late because it would disappoint her.

Even though it was over the phone, based on her tone alone, I could tell she was slightly annoyed by my answer. She hung up after without saying much. Later, her husband texts me (or her using her husbands phone) and asks me again to reconsider. My sister is 5'7 and 145 pounds, so i dont understand the issue.

22,1cjnpwf,AITA for saying I won't sleep in the bed if my child sleeps in it too?,"My wife and I have two kids (4M, 1F) and sleep can be pretty hard to come by in general with two young kids. But it's a bit harder for me because I have bipolar disorder and insomnia that's really connected to my mood - if I don't sleep, I tend to have a major mood shift. Also, I have arthritis so have pretty achy joints and feel pretty run down a lot. 

I've basically been sleeping in the guest room for the last 9 months. At first it was because my wife wanted to co-sleep with our baby and I didn't feel comfortable sharing a bed with them because I take meds to help my insomnia that make me a deep sleeper and I was afraid it wouldn't be safe for all of us. Our daughter's been out of our bed for a few months now but as soon as she left, our 4 year old started sleeping in there. And even though it's not about safety with him in there, with my insomnia and difficulties falling asleep, unless I am relaxed in the environment it is so hard to sleep and it's hard to relax with a starfished out 4 year old. 

So I just have essentially moved to the guest room to sleep otherwise I feel that I won't be able to sleep and that can trigger a mood episode or make my joints feel crummy.

I asked him if this is really about his future kids (a few months ago he was pushing the idea that having kids is pointless to my younger brother and I) and he just kept dodging the question. He also *allegedly* harassed my mother (55F) on multiple occasions asking ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt he giving his stuff to me‚Äù (not exactly what he said but it was something along those lines). I stand firm in my decision and I‚Äôm trying my best to not let him interfere with my life. I feel like I have to avoid him because he just causes too much stress in my life (we still live together).

Edit: I‚Äôm so sorry that I left this out. I should‚Äôve included it in the original post. My brother also has this information hoarding complex where he just downloads as much textbooks and other information as possible. He also is paranoid that he might accidentally ‚Äúdrop something‚Äù (I have no clues what that ‚Äòsomething‚Äô is) when he is in public. He also is paranoid that he might accidentally say something about some online piracy websites so he always asks either my younger brother or myself if he did (he does not have Tourettes syndrome).",0.0,-0.0150268180295825,0,1
28,1ckcm7x,WIBTA for asking my MIL to use a mobility device on our next outing? ,"My in-laws are visiting this weekend. We have a pretty good relationship, although we get annoyed with her sometimes. Like last night when she was saying how she only brought one pair of shoes even though they give her blisters, stuff like that.

My MIL has really poor lung function and sometimes needs oxygen (which she refuses to bring, even when someone else carries it). She has some other health issues but she is very full of life and social, wants to be included in things.

This caused some issues last summer, when we all travelled abroad to visit some of my spouse's extended family. We have two kids, 10 and 13. This was probably the only international trip my kids will go on for a long time, so of course we wanted to do a lot of sightseeing and activities when we weren't visiting his aunts and uncles (who were not available all the time).

We see FIL and MIL in our country all the time, so didn't feel the need to have them along on every excursion. But my MIL really wants to be included, and isn't honest with herself about what kinds of activities she can handle. This led to a memorable situation where even after we told her what day we had planned, she came along, only to get halfway across a huge pedestrian only zone and unable to continue. The only way out was through, so of course we all just walked physically supporting her, with lots of breaks until we got to an area where we could get her a taxi. We all laughed it off, but it was actually pretty awful.

This weekend, it's cherry blossom season and we have free tickets to the botanical gardens. I said we had planned to go and would they like to come with. I figured the garden itself would be ok, there's walking, but it's small, and there are more exits and places to stop. 

Then I remembered my MIL's shoes. No way was she going to be comfortable walking, but of course she never turns down an invitation or admits that it's too much for her. Her solution was wearing these open toed slides that are usually her indoor shoes. I almost cancelled at that point. 

We were going at her pace, but my kids were going a little nuts with waiting around so I sped up with them to go see something else, while the other 3 continued slowly. When we got back, my MIL had tripped and fallen, and split open her forehead. She's ok, thankfully. 

I don't think I can handle another situation like this. WIBTA for insisting she use a wheelchair or mobility device the next time we go on an excursion?  It's a pretty simple solution to her wanting to be included in her kid's and grandkids' active lives. The other option is that we just don't try to go anywhere with them, but when we're visiting with nothing planned, they sit on the couch, watch tv and sleep. We can talk of course, but there's only so many hours that any of us want that.

My mom became more sensitive and her patience became less. When her sisters came to visit they stress her out. My mom felt happy in a peaceful environment, but her siblings didn't provide that. They always show up un-announced. They never call before a visit. My mom needs to know when people come because she gets tremors and gets nervous by surprises.

35,1ckbk9r,AITA for not visiting a friend who had a plaster on his leg?,"We are a group of friends since around 2 years, met in college and are still friends 1 year after graduating, all of us are around 21-22 years old.

One of our friends ‚ÄòM‚Äô(M21) has been arguing and breaking off friendships and reconciling with people from the group over petty things ever since we graduated.

3 weeks ago M had to get a leg surgery to remove some fluid that was getting retained in an old injury. It was nothing major or life threatening. The day he got the surgery, me and another friend were going to meet him (the hospital was 20 mins from my house) and he told us not to come, and to visit him at home instead. 

The day two of our friends went to visit him was the day it was my father‚Äôs birthday so I told them I won‚Äôt be coming that day, M started telling me that I‚Äôm prioritising a birthday over a surgery, i thought he was joking but now I‚Äôm not so sure.

Then there was an argument in our group chat, a group chat M created without including some members of the group because he had a fall out with them (which was completely his fault). M said something about this girl on our separate group chat because she texted him get well soon after his surgery, so the rest of us started fighting that it was your fault first of all etc etc. 

After this my LDR boyfriend was visiting my city as it was my birthday and he was here for 10 days. M didn‚Äôt attend my birthday party because he had plaster on his leg. My bf met all of my friends except M. We thought of visiting M but couldn‚Äôt because we had a lot of things planned.

Now M is mad at me that I didn‚Äôt visit him during his ‚Äútough times‚Äù. He uploaded some story about tough times show you real friends on his alt account, which I didn‚Äôt event realise was for me until another friend told me. I didn‚Äôt react so he removed me from his alt. The uploaded the same post on close friends on his main account, and removed everyone else from the list so only I see it, then once I viewed the story he removed me from his main account as well.

He had the plaster for like 3 weeks, first we had that argument, then my bf was here. I run a small business all by myself so once bf left I had to take care of the backlog of orders in the 10 days I couldn‚Äôt work.

He told our other friends that even when he said that the plaster was going to be taken off in 2 days, I didn‚Äôt go to visit him. What is the big deal about meeting him only when he has the plaster?

And even if he had a problem shouldn‚Äôt he have directly confronted me at least once? Instead of outright cutting me off without even asking?

AITA here?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-04,"AITA for not visiting a friend who had a plaster on his leg? We are a group of friends since around 2 years, met in college and are still friends 1 year after graduating, all of us are around 21-22 years old.

One of our friends ‚ÄòM‚Äô(M21) has been arguing and breaking off friendships and reconciling with people from the group over petty things ever since we graduated.

3 weeks ago M had to get a leg surgery to remove some fluid that was getting retained in an old injury. It was nothing major or life threatening. The day he got the surgery, me and another friend were going to meet him (the hospital was 20 mins from my house) and he told us not to come, and to visit him at home instead. 

The day two of our friends went to visit him was the day it was my father‚Äôs birthday so I told them I won‚Äôt be coming that day, M started telling me that I‚Äôm prioritising a birthday over a surgery, i thought he was joking but now I‚Äôm not so sure.

Then there was an argument in our group chat, a group chat M created without including some members of the group because he had a fall out with them (which was completely his fault). M said something about this girl on our separate group chat because she texted him get well soon after his surgery, so the rest of us started fighting that it was your fault first of all etc etc. 

After this my LDR boyfriend was visiting my city as it was my birthday and he was here for 10 days. M didn‚Äôt attend my birthday party because he had plaster on his leg. My bf met all of my friends except M. We thought of visiting M but couldn‚Äôt because we had a lot of things planned.

Now M is mad at me that I didn‚Äôt visit him during his ‚Äútough times‚Äù. He uploaded some story about tough times show you real friends on his alt account, which I didn‚Äôt event realise was for me until another friend told me. I didn‚Äôt react so he removed me from his alt. The uploaded the same post on close friends on his main account, and removed everyone else from the list so only I see it, then once I viewed the story he removed me from his main account as well.

37,1ckb163,AITA for wanting my brother to pay me for my guitar?,"I (17m) purchased a guitar back during the pandemic, when I was 14, with my own money. I had been working as a newspaper deliverer for a local media company for around a year and half, accumulating around 1500$. My choice: a Jackson King V, which retails for about 1300$, all of which I paid for myself without any help from my parents.

During this time, my younger brother (15m, then 12) also took up the guitar.

I had taken up the double bass in my school's string band and had agreed to take on the role of guitar player in the jazz band. However, my brother had made a bit of a name for himself as a guitarist within the school and was approached by one of the music teachers to play guitar in the jazz band, taking my place.

Everything was going smoothly through the end of my junior year at high school, but that all changed at the beginning of my senior year. Due to the amount of work required to maintain my GPA, on top of me being in pretty much all of the hardest courses offered at my school (all AP), I had to make some sacrifices.

I made the extremely difficult decision to stop playing the guitar as I no longer had any real time to practice it. Though, I had chosen to continue playing the bass in the string band as I am in a music course to boost my GPA.

At the end of January, I noticed my brother had begun practicing on my guitar. I was at first annoyed by this, but I understood that I had not been playing it, and he was wanting to use it for a few recitals.

I had managed to maintain an excellent GPA and had managed to get accepted into a very nice school that I will be attending in the fall, and I need to move into a residence.

Since my brother has started playing my Jackson, it has become HIS guitar. Anytime my parents talk about it, its MY BROTHER'S guitar.

I've been wanting to bring my Jackson along with me, so that I'll have the option to play it whenever.

When I brought this up to my mother, she informed me that I would have to ask my brother for permission to take that guitar with me. I retorted that it was still MY guitar as I had been the one to pay for it, and that he had no right to tell me I couldn‚Äôt bring it with me. She then said that since I had decided to stop playing guitar, it was now HIS guitar.

For some added context, he already has two of his own guitars that he still plays regularly, and he has a decent playing job coaching sports, so he could buy his own guitar.

After about a half hour of arguing, we concluded that the guitar was STAYING here when I moved away in the fall, but I had the condition that he had to buy it off of me. This angered my parents and my brother.

My price was 1000$, less than what I'd paid, and less than what a new one would have cost. My brother has more than enough money to buy this from me. A decision has not been made as of yet, but I am getting the impression that I won't be seeing that money for my guitar.

39,1ckaj2i,AITA for telling my spouse to prioritize work over their game night?,"My significant other plays D&D with their siblings and friends, and they planned a Friday to have a game night.  
   
They work a graveyard shift security job, and has specific days off out of the week, though they can call in for a sick day if they have to.

They settled on Friday to have their game, but my spouse only had Wednesday and Thursday off of work that week. They tried to ask their boss for that day off, claiming an appointment or something, and was denied for it. But they STILL plan to try and claim a sick day for it, which I said looks incredibly suspicious after having tried to get that timeframe off.

While I understand the value of having nights with friends and loved ones, I didn't feel it was worth the risk of getting looked down on at work. If they kept playing loose with it, they might end up on the boss' list of potential fires if they need to downsize or move people. They already have a decent rep and all, so I worry about them risking that by trying to take extra days off just to play games.

We didn't have an argument about it, but I could for sure feel something from them after I had suggested firmly that they shouldn't play around with things like that. They said that the other people they play with were only able to get certain days free with planning in advance, so they feel like this was their only day they could manage it. I understood that.. but I just worry too much about it.   
  
If you JUST tried to get a certain timeframe off from work, and got denied, and STILL tried to claim a sickness or something around that timeframe, that just concerns me that their employers will think horribly about them, and risk their position there. 

But I do feel like I might've been trying to 'adult' too much, because I feel awful for it. They enjoy it, and it's the only socializing I've ever seen them do. I feel like I might have been playing a parental role for something that wasn't really my business. Maybe work DOESN'T work like that, and I'm worrying for nothing? But I just feel like it's not a good idea to do that.. I STILL feel like it's not a smart move to play hooky like that. Was it really my business to try and redirect them like that?   
  
Am I wrong in thinking they might be thought of worse by the employers for that? I don't want to be the person who has to be like 'adult more important than silly game', given I do indeed have my vices as well like that, but this just sounded like a wrong move.

40,1ckai0v,AITAH for not going to see my mum ,"My mum has arthritis and over the years has been in and out of hospital with it as well as having a few falls and requiring hip surgery. 

I see her every weekend but the day will fluctuate, we usually go for a drive, have lunch somewhere and I will sometimes take her grocery shopping and do odd chores in the house for her. 

This weekend I hadn't confirmed if I was coming on Saturday or Sunday so this morning (Saturday) I called her saying I wasn't feeling great (I have my own health issues) and that I would see her tomorrow. She said she was feeling unwell too but would try and get out. I told her I was going to have a rest today. I went to get a few groceries, gamed for a bit and felt a bit better so my husband and I shared a bottle of wine with our dinner. 

I finished my dinner around 7:15 and noticed I had a missed call from her at 7 so I called her back. 

She said she was in a lot of pain and hadn't been able to leave her bed to get tablets or water. She asked if I could come over. I told her I'd two glasses of wine and was about to say I could get a taxi over when she interrupted me to say that she knew I'd never come round and that I shouldn't have had any wine tonight. I told her she should have called me earlier as she knew I hadn't been busy today and could have called over but now I was over the limit and couldn't drive. I also said if I wanted to have a glass or two of wine with dinner on a Saturday that was my choice. This isn't anything to do with alcoholism btw, myself, my mum and our family luckily have a healthy relationship with alcohol so this isn't  to do with concern around alcohol. 

My mum and her family can have quite manipulative tendancies and I set myself boundaries with her. I have also caught her out on lies before when she has claimed to be too ill to leave the house but I've seen her in a coffee shop in town. So whilst I couldn't drive due to having a few glasses of wine, I will admit that part of me did expect she was exaggerating for sympathy and attention. It later emerged she has been able to leave her bed, get herself something to eat, use the bathroom etc. 

We ended up having an argument. A lot was said and she claimed if she told people I'd started an argument (even tho I maintain she started the argument as I couldn't come over) with her after her telling me she was sick and asking me to come help her, people would say how terrible that was and how it's perfectly reasonable for her to ask me to come over. I don't deny it is reasonable for her to ask me for help and many times in the past I have dropped everything to take her to A&E etc but her reaction to me initially saying I couldn't drive over is completely irrational I feel.

Alison (fake name) is from Group A and owns a bussiness. She recently bought out another company where Greg from Group B works in.

New employees earned more than older ones, etc. All in all, it was a headache according to Alison.

Greg complained about the new management because he didn't get a pay raise while the others did. What's more, he apparently got written up because he was on call with us as he worked, he had inappropriate conversations with another staff and etc.

I told Greg that he should take his job a bit more seriously (job pays really nice according to Greg). And Greg told me it's just corporate shit and how the new management have sticks up their asses and they won't fire him because he's the only who knows what their doing.

Well, Greg got fired. A few people did.

My boyfriend who knew about my friend buying out thr company accidentally let it slip that I knew they were looking to fire workers.

Greg is extremely upset that I didn't warn him and how it caused him his job. And that in this market, it's difficult to find a good paying one. And how I'm just playing a role in the corporate world.

The mother started pleading because her daughter wanted tot play on the swing. I asked her again to leave. She started arguing, saying it didn't look like private property because there isn't a fence or gate to keep people out. Meanwhile, her daughter lost interest in the swing and started trashing my kids playhouse. I lost it and told them to p*ss off or I would call the police. The child started crying and the mother scolded me. I know they were trespassing but I feel a little guilty for making a child cry, AITA?

Edit: it's very obvious it's a private garden (there is a chicken coop, a vegetable garden, garden furniture and most important: my house)",0.0,0.03860411420464516,0,1
43,1cka53h,WIBTA if I told my 2 friends/roommates to stop involving me in their issues with each other?,"So very long story short, I (21f) live with 2 other girls, Hannah (20f) and Leah (21f)(fake names) Hannah and I shared a dorm last year and we were both friends with Leah, though I was much closer with her than hannah was. We moved in together in an apartment off campus and things have slowly been falling apart more and more. Hannah and Leah kind of hate each other. Every little thing they do annoys the other. Nothing either of them can do will ever be good enough for the other. They're constantly pissed at each other, and always dragging me into it. They will always complain and vent to me about the other one, which puts me in a really uncomfortable position as I love them both, and they both have moments where they're right and wrong, but both Hannah and Leah want me to be 100% only on their side, all the time. I cannot handle it anymore. I'm so sick of being put in the middle and having to be forced to choose a side between them . 

The current issue going on is as follows. Both Hannah and Leah struggle with eating disorders. Hannah sat both of us down the other day and was telling us how she's been really stressed and somewhat relapsing with her eating disorder. Of course we both told her we'd be there for her and if she needs anything, etc. Yesterday, Hannah sent in the groupchat ""I ate two meals today and I am proud :) I haven't done that in a week. ü´°"" and I replied ""YAY IM SO PROUD OF YOU"" Leah didn't respond until today, and she said, ""so proud!"" 

Then Leah texts me separately basically saying that what Hannah had said was triggering for her because she also has eating issues and Hannah saying that she's only been eating one meal a day is a lot for her to hear, which I understand. So Leah tells me she texted Hannah about it and wants to also tell her that she shouldn't tell me that stuff or just ask if I'm okay with hearing that stuff. I said Leah doesn't have to do that, that I'm fine and don't mind hearing about it, but I understand why she doesn't. Leah keeps going on about Hannah oversharing and that she didn't take what Leah texted her well. Then like 5 minutes later, Hannah also texts me separately,  saying that Leah texted her something and that's she's really upset and wants to talk to me about it. I haven't responded yet.

Would I be the asshole for telling them both that they need to stop dragging me into their arguments with each other? I have no part in this, none of this is affecting me. I'm so tired of playing mediator, and I especially cannot deal with this right now. It's the middle of finals for me, and I have a severe sinus infection as well and I don't really want to be talking to anybody let alone dealing with Hannah and Leah's shit. However, I know that if i try to pull out if this, all that will happen is that they will be annoyed at me for choosing the other ones side, or not caring enough about them individually to be angry at the other.

Anyone who knows him would definitely describe him as an unserious guy with a pretty dark sense of humour. For context, around this time last year he put a fake positive pregnancy test in the bathroom after my girl was in there. 

So on April 1st this year, I had been expecting a joke all day, and then when I got home after work I heard him sobbing on the couch. Obviously, I assumed this was a trick but I tried to be good about it. He‚Äôs not the type of guy to cry about things so that‚Äôs also why I didn‚Äôt think he was being serious. I asked him what happened and he said his dad had a heart attack and died en route to the hospital. At this point I pretty much knew he was joking but I kept asking questions and it just kept seeming more and more like a prank, like his dad was at a steak restaurant and had apparently ordered the thing where if you eat it in under an hour you get it for free (his dad sent him a picture of it before everything went down). I cracked a smile and he asked what was so funny and I just went on saying I knew what he was doing and I thought he would have something better up his sleeve than this, but he assured me he wasn‚Äôt joking. He kept crying and I kept laughing saying ‚ÄúSure you‚Äôre not‚Äù, but then I realised a few minutes in that he wasn‚Äôt kidding and I swear I really apologised for it. I said if he needed anything, I‚Äôd be there, and I meant it. At the time, my friend told me it was all good. 

But yesterday my friend took something of mine that I really needed that day (long story) and we got into a fight about it, and when I got mad at him he brought up the fact I laughed when his dad died.

His dad was a decent guy who I‚Äôd met a few times and he was pretty funny like my friend so I do feel bad, but what was I supposed to expect from him?

I've already made a few friends attending the interviews. Unfortunately, our family has a trip planned to Jordan that overlaps with the necessary training hours for this program. 

I wanted to opt out of the family trip to be able to attend this internship. However, when I suggested this, my mom told me absolutely not: that it was ""not my decision to make"" and that she'd force me to come if she had to. She threatened that if I did not come on the family trip, she would stop paying for my high school tuition, and I could either pay it myself or drop out. (Note: I am 16, without a job, and my tuition is something like 50,000 dollars a year. I cannot pay for it myself.) 

I am currently waiting to hear back from the program to see if I can train at a different time. However, if this is not possible, I would prefer to opt out of the family trip and attend the internship. I would not expect either of my parents to stay at home with me. Frankly, the trip - as wonderful as it sounds- is not a trip meant for me. It's more of a trip for my parents, with things they would enjoy. I understand that my mom has put a lot of time and effort into planning and booking this trip. However, I feel as if it is my choice in the end right?

49,1ck9q55,AITAH for communicating 4 weeks in advance what colour the bride will wear to our wedding?,"I (34M) am getting married in 3 weeks. It is not going to be a typical wedding with the bride (33F) in white, but she has chosen to wear red. She decided on the colour last week, after considering several options. She also decided on the colour because the place where we are having the wedding dinner is a place where the restaurant's policy does not accept wedding celebrations and they asked us to be discreet. Besides, my future wife has never liked to have a conventional wedding.

It is going to be a small wedding, about 30 people. We asked for confirmation months ago and a cousin of mine (33F), with whom we have always been friends, started to make excuses for not coming: that the wedding is in a city far from where she lives, that she doesn't like weddings (although she has been to weddings of many common acquaintances) etc. Finally she said she would come to the wedding and we counted her and her partner as guests at the celebration.

Everything was going well until last week, when we announced that the bride would be wearing red (and as protocol suggest, no one should wear the same colour as the bride). Then my cousin calls me angry because the dress that my cousin has chosen for the event is also red (It's the same dress she was wearing in the last wedding she was invited from a common friend), that if the bride is also wearing red I am an AH for not telling her before and asks to cancel her and her partner's table, when we are already out of time to correct the number of people attending the celebration with the restaurant (so we will pay their menu anyways).

So, AITAH for communicating 4 weeks in advance what colour the bride will wear to our wedding?

EDIT: to clarify some information:

-We are not trying to fool the restaurant. They know it's a wedding and they allow us to celebrate it but keeping it discreet.

-We didn't tell our guests what is the protocol about having the same color as the bride. We don't ban anyone if they choose to go with the same color, but guests can see it strange and that is out of our control.",Asshole,2024-05-04,"AITAH for communicating 4 weeks in advance what colour the bride will wear to our wedding?

Then my cousin calls me angry because the dress that my cousin has chosen for the event is also red (It's the same dress she was wearing in the last wedding she was invited from a common friend), that if the bride is also wearing red I am an AH for not telling her before and asks to cancel her and her partner's table, when we are already out of time to correct the number of people attending the celebration with the restaurant (so we will pay their menu anyways).

So, AITAH for communicating 4 weeks in advance what colour the bride will wear to our wedding?

EDIT: to clarify some information:

-We are not trying to fool the restaurant. They know it's a wedding and they allow us to celebrate it but keeping it discreet.

-We didn't tell our guests what is the protocol about having the same color as the bride. We don't ban anyone if they choose to go with the same color, but guests can see it strange and that is out of our control.",1.0,1.032077431678772,1,1
50,1ck9hhg,AITA for getting mad at my friend over a prank?,"I 19 (f) went out last night with my friends, 19 (f), 118 (m), and 18 (m). We are a relatively close friend group, and go out together a few times a month. Last night, was a really fun night before the latter half. We all had just gotten food from wing stop, and decided to go eat at the park down the street. My friend, I'll call John, drove us in his brand new charger, for context this park is close to an area in town thats known for crime. We ate at the park for a little bit, and then we went to the playground part of the park. As we were swinging on the swings, we saw a group of guys walk up to Johns car, which is the only car in the parking lot, and they were just hanging around it. Obviously, we were nervous, so we walked closer to the car, (still relatively far away) and noticed they weren't outside the car, but inside the car, and they had hoods on with purge masks. As we got closer they saw us, got out of the car, and reached for their waistbands. Our friend John yelled for us to run and that they had guns, so thats what we did. My female friend was on the verge of tears, John was calling the cops, and my other friend went off. We sprinted what felt like two miles in the span of 3 minutes, we were terrified, it was late at night, and in a bad area. My friend that went off managed to get back into his car, and drove off, but I had his phone so as far as we knew, he was caught. Once we saw the cops, we went to them and started talking to them, they were questioning us on everything that happened and honestly it was so stressful and overwhelming. About 5 minutes into talking with the cops, our friend John got a call from a friend and they admitted to this all being a prank on our other male friend. Me and my female friend have never met these guys except for seeing them occasionally at the gym. They had BB guns, and chased us through the park, but apparently it was a funny prank. They wouldn't come to talk to the cops and showed no remorse. Our male friend that had ran off drove to a McDonalds and banged on their door trying to get them to call the cops. It was chaos and I'm honestly terrified to go out again, especially with those friends.
So that brings me to this post. My friend who the prank was pulled on, I'll call his Kyle, isn't seeing why this is wrong. My female friend (I'll call her Jaime) and I, have been trying to get the names of Kyles friends all morning, and he won't tell us. He thinks we should leave it alone, but it feels like he's protecting them, which is insane after what they did. Id still like to be Kyles friend, but I want something done. This was traumatizing, and Jaime and I shouldn't be pranked by men we don't even know. Jaime wants to get their address and talk to their parents, but I don't see them getting in trouble, they are teenage boys. Im not sure what, but I want something done, this was extremely scary, and they ruined a really fun night.

51,1ck9brd,AITA For Calling My Wife A Hypocrite For Banning Her Daughter From Wearing Makeup To Cover Acne Despite The Fact My Wife Does It,"I (30f) married a woman (40f) in January of 2024. My wife, who we'll call Yazmin, has two daughters who we'll called Penny (12f) and Lily (10f). Yazmin, and her 3 sisters has acne since they were 12. It's like a family curse. For them it's full face, upper neck, full back, full shoulders, and upper arm covered in pimples that leaves scars even if they don't mess with the pimples. Their mother's acne didn't clear until she went menopause. 
          Yazmin has a rule that her daughter are not allowed to wear makeup until they are 18. When I first heard it I thought it wasn't practical given her daughters' ancestry but I didn't make a fuss about it at the time. But since April, poor Penny got her 1st zit, a big red pimple in the middle of her forehead. Given she, like the rest of her family, is blonde and very fair skinned it really stands out. Poor thing had to go out like that. Then the rest of her forehead got covered in pimples, then her chin, then her cheeks, and it's still spreading. 
      Yazmin gets to put on makeup first thing in morning and takes it off at bedtime. She, and her sisters were allowed to wear makeup when they were kids. Acne is horrible whether or not you get to cover it with makeup but at least the makeup helps a little. I saw this young girl beg with tears flowing down her face for her mother to allow her to wear makeup. Yazmin keeps refusing.
       A few days ago, Penny was again begging her mom. This time Lily was also begging on her sister's behalf. Yazmin refused, and I called Yazmin a hypocrite to her face, in front of her daughters. I then explained farther by pointing out the facts of how Yazmin and her sisters were allowed to wear makeup. I then said that if Penny and Lily are not allowed to wear makeup then Yazmin should stop wearing makeup. Yazmin yelled saying I have no idea what's it like to have acne, and that she has to wear it to be taken seriously at work. I said then Penny needs to wear it to be treated at school. Yazmin got angrier and said I never had acne so I don't get to have an opinion. 
           Later in the night, Yazmin was crying. I have literally never mentioned her acne before that moment. She was asking me if she's ugly to me. I told her she is the most beautiful woman in the world to me. She's has been insecure ever since. I feel like I was an asshole to my wife. She was been crying ever night since.

52,1ck962x,AITA for asking my brother to fit the dress code for my graduation dinner?,"I (18F) am graduating high school soon. We have a graduation dinner coming up and the dress code is ‚Äúformal/gala.‚Äù If you‚Äôre unsure what that means, just take into consideration that some men are wearing full blown tuxedos. My mom, dad, and brother (26M) are coming with me. 

I asked my brother if he knew what he was wearing and he listed out the items and colors. I noticed that his blazer wouldn‚Äôt match his pants. I told him that isn‚Äôt in dress code and asked if he could pick one color and get a new blazer or pants to match it. He got SO mad at me. Talking about ‚ÄúI know what the dress code is and I‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶ Stop pressuring me‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not listening‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre a child‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. 

I told him that my mom and I don‚Äôt want to wear long dresses, my dad doesn‚Äôt want to wear a tie, but we do it for the event because that‚Äôs the dress code. And I told him that if he‚Äôs not going to fit the dress code, I don‚Äôt want him going because he‚Äôs too stubborn to do one little thing that literally everybody does for this event. 

For extra context, my brother has really bad issues with authority and criticism. No one can say anything to him that‚Äôs even slightly different than what‚Äôs in his head or he will argue like crazy and block you out. He‚Äôs pretty much always been like this even with me as his little sister. A couple years ago, I visited his apartment and told him that it was filthy and he should work on that because he lived and worked there. He blew up saying it was my fault as his guest there and he blocked my number for 3 months until my dad finally told him to unblock me. 

AITA? Does he have a point? Should I let it go and let him show up how he wants or should I insist that he match the dress code? 

Update and Clarification: He blocked me. He still lives in the same house so he‚Äôs not exactly estranged at the moment. His pants are grey and his blazer is blue. I wouldn‚Äôt care if it were his event or it wasn‚Äôt literally a gala event, but it‚Äôs an event for me and it‚Äôs extremely formal. I‚Äôm not asking him to rent a tuxedo like everyone else, but I am asking him to match his pants and blazer.

Update 2: My brother approached my mom and said that he didn‚Äôt want to follow the dress code and that he‚Äôd rather not go than follow it. That‚Äôs fine by me, as I had said that already. My mom sold the ticket when he made the decision not to go because of the dress code and the conversation is over. 

Thank you for your honest opinions and comments. Some of you have brought up the fact that my parents should be the ones to decide since they‚Äôre paying and they‚Äôre our parents. I agree, but unfortunately, my family situation isn‚Äôt so simple. I am often in the middle of things and they had asked me to approach him because I‚Äôm the only one in the family who can sometimes reason with him.

55,1ck8ryg,AITA For having separate birthday parties with different friends?,"I (20m) am turning 20 years old today, I am still in college and I have 2 groups of friends, let‚Äôs call them group 1 and group 2, the thing is that they totally don‚Äôt like each other, last year I tried to do just one party with both groups but they ended up fighting and I was in the middle of everything. 

This year I decided to make sure that the situation didn‚Äôt happen again, so I decided to hace 2 parties. Go out to a bar with group 1 on Friday, and then do a small party at my house with group 2 on Saturday. The problem came because I decided to not tell the groups about these separate parties, I really didn‚Äôt think it would be necessary since well, I repeat, they really don‚Äôt like each other, and you only tell about the party to the people that you invite to the party.

There was this 1 friend that is a part of both groups, so on Friday (yesterday) at the bar we were with group 1 having fun, my friend had to leave and when saying goodbye to everybody she told them: ‚Äúsee you tomorrow‚Äù, my friends in Group 1 were confused and asked her what she meant and well, they found out about the other party.

I (20m) am turning 20 years old today, I am still in college and I have 2 groups of friends, let‚Äôs call them group 1 and group 2, the thing is that they totally don‚Äôt like each other, last year I tried to do just one party with both groups but they ended up fighting and I was in the middle of everything. 

This year I decided to make sure that the situation didn‚Äôt happen again, so I decided to hace 2 parties. Go out to a bar with group 1 on Friday, and then do a small party at my house with group 2 on Saturday. The problem came because I decided to not tell the groups about these separate parties, I really didn‚Äôt think it would be necessary since well, I repeat, they really don‚Äôt like each other, and you only tell about the party to the people that you invite to the party.

There was this 1 friend that is a part of both groups, so on Friday (yesterday) at the bar we were with group 1 having fun, my friend had to leave and when saying goodbye to everybody she told them: ‚Äúsee you tomorrow‚Äù, my friends in Group 1 were confused and asked her what she meant and well, they found out about the other party.

They told me they weren‚Äôt mad at the fact that I was doing 2 parties (but by their tone I think they were in fact angry at me), but they were mad that they found out about the other party from another person and not from me, they also said that I could‚Äôve just done 1 party with both groups and they would‚Äôve just made sure to not have any arguments with the other group, which is not true because like I said, last year I did one party with both groups and they fought.

56,1ck8i6t,AITA for not going to the theatre on my birthday?,"Hi! I would be very grateful if you told me what you honestly think about this situation:

Yesterday was my 20th birthday so my fiance planned a trip to London to celebrate (we live in Paris). Yesterday was supposed to be the piece de resistance of the whole trip: we had tickets to a West End show I was dying to see. 

Just for context: my fiance is crippled and most days, he uses a cane for comfort almost every day. Yesterday, however, he said he was feeling exceptionally good, that he didn‚Äôt need it and would be happy to go out, do some activities, be able to take pictures together without his cane. 

I asked him whether he was sure twice. He reassured me. Throughout the morning, I could tell he was struggling a little so I chose activities that wouldn‚Äôt overexert him: we went to a lovely caf√© for breakfast, we took a short walk in Hyde Park, we visited Keats‚Äôs house (I chose that one specifically because it was far and we had to take an uber which gave him an opportunity to sit for a while). 

He took painkillers at lunch so by then I insisted on going back to the hotel to rest a bit and get ready for the evening performance. At the hotel, it got worse: he was having cramps every now and then, I could tell he was really uncomfortable so I said we weren‚Äôt going to the theatre. He protested at first and told me we would go, then recognised that he‚Äôs too tired to sit in a theatre armchair for two hours with his leg in such a state and urged me to go on my own. 

As much as I wanted to see the show, it was out of the question to just leave him. He has cancelled his own plans for my sake in the past when I wasn‚Äôt feeling well, so I couldn‚Äôt possibly do that to him. Besides, I would rather celebrate my birthday in his presence rather than be out on my own.

He got impatient with me saying that I should go, urging me to get ready. I thought it was sweet at first but then he got really upset over me refusing to go and asked for some time alone. I went out for five minutes to get snacks and showered when I came back. 

He apologised for ruining my day but wouldn‚Äôt let me tend to him and I could tell he was tense. This morning, he was still giving me the cold shoulder and left the hotel earlier than he was supposed to (spending the day apart was part of the plan since my hometown is just a few miles west of London and my parents wanted to see me).

Now, this is something that made the matters even worse: my parents‚Äôs birthday gift was going to see a different West End production together. I laughed at the coincidence and had lots of fun but when I came back to the hotel and told my fiance about my day, I think he got even more upset. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this.

I moved her stuff, including over a pallet's worth into my yard, rest to a friend's she's been crashing at, took in 2 of her BF's cats at her request, and tried to help her dispute the eviction and get her damage deposit back (but she never sent me the documents so I couldn't file). I also started trying to be friends with her BF, as he was coming by frequently to visit/look after his cats.

~A month later her and her BF were having problems and the drama started. She'd exaggerate about something he did and expect me to immediately side with her, but it became pretty clear that she wasn't being truthful.

But what actually happened is they were together, she didn't get ready fast enough (which apparently is his fault for not reminding her), and they missed their bus. So she got upset, and instead of finding another ride decided not to go and fight about it. He walked out because he knew he wasn't going to win, she blocked him, and messaged me crying about it.

59,1ck8dt4,AITA for considering eloping with just my two closest friends and my fianc√©'s parents to keep his meddling sister away without drama?,"My fianc√© Brodie (27m) and I (26f) have been engaged for two years and together for 5. We have talked about the wedding we want for a while now. We agreed we wanted a smaller wedding, with less fuss and stress. This has not been working out for us and that's because of his sister Tara (30f). Tara has been on my case lately about getting my two half-sister's involved in my life and the wedding so I can have family present. This isn't possible. She has been told to stop by Brodie and their parents but she's acting like it's her place to decide this. Tara told us I can't/won't invite my parents but at the very least I should invite my siblings so we can be actual siblings again.

She is aware of my background and aware of the fact my half-sister's do not want a relationship with me. They both moved out of my parents house by the time I was 7. They were my mom's kids. My mom and dad weren't great people and I know they felt like mom downgraded from their dad after he died. I remember the four of them used to fight like crazy and when I got a little older I realized how awful my parents were. Dad was super strict to the point you couldn't ask for help with homework or anything. Firstly because you couldn't question him or mom at all, about anything. And also because homework was our job as kids and you do not get help because as an adult you don't get help with your job and you do it and you do it right or face consequences. He also said disgusting things about their dad even after they had moved out. My mom let him. She'd also bitch that the girls refused to move on with her and how she regretted having them and being tied to a dead guy for the rest of her life. It was awful. I felt so bad for my half-sister's because I knew it must have been so much worse for them when it was their dad being talked about like that. I reached out when I was 19 and told them I'd love a relationship and I was so sorry for my parents treatment of them and how I'd gone no contact with my parents as well. But I never got a reply. And I know both saw the messages I sent. They just never replied. So I took that as them not wanting to know me.

Tara knows all this but she still presses the issue and lately Brodie and I have talked about eloping to save all the drama. He could take his parents, I could take my two closest friends and we could take us all someplace nice and marry privately. Brodie's parents think it sounds great but his extended family heard we were considering this and they said it's not fair to deny the family the chance to see him get married.

So now I feel bad because it's mostly me worried that Tara will try to find my half-sister's or something or maybe even my parents if she also can't get a reply from my half-sister's.

61,1ck7eyf,AITA for being angry at this? ,"Hi - I am 38(m). I didn‚Äôt meet my dad until I was 13. He has an ex wife who I get on with very well, and two kids with her and he has a current wife who he has a child with. I am the oldest. I never ask my dad for anything. I was down visiting recently my SM made an issue about my dad buying me dinner - in front of family friends and others. The family friend asked what we are doing in terms of paying the bill and my step mother said ‚Äò there are three of us ‚Äò meaning her, my dad and her own daughter. The family friend said ‚Äò what about ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòME‚Äô..  I don‚Äôt know what my SM said but the family friends reaction was one of shock and she then looked at me sheepishly and apologised for me paying for myself. My dad then offered to pay for me and my SM started shouting at him in-front of everyone as to why he shouldn‚Äôt. 

1. I have never asked for anything in my life and ALWAYS pay my own way. 
2. I see my dad twice a year. 
3. My sister is constantly bailed out by her mum 
(My dad says he is ‚Äò powerless ‚Äò to stop her bailing her out) 

This triggered past issues: 

I asked about the next family holiday a year ago and was told by my step mother ‚Äò we are not organising a family holiday this year but you can come with us if you want ‚Äò . Not long after I was joking with a family friend who said to me ‚Äò just because you‚Äôre not invited on holiday ‚Äò. Nice. So I was an after thought and then my SM started telling me how expensive it would be. she then proceeded, right in front of me, to persuade her daughters not friends to come and she could get them a discount.

I would always be sat away from my dad on any special occasions when we go out. I would always be told where to sit at dinner - away from her my dad and my sister. This last Xmas I was told ‚Äò I‚Äôve put you there ‚Äò pointing to the end of the table‚Ä¶. She made a point of telling me this twice, but told no one else anything.

I even once saw her move my plate and swap with hers at the table so she was next to my dad‚Ä¶.. 

I don‚Äôt care about money, it‚Äôs the behaviour. I never ask for anything. My other siblings had issues too. 

I spoke to him the day after. He agreed with some points (‚Äò‚Äô I should have put my foot down ‚Äò‚Äô) but said I was being paranoid about others. He said he would address it.  I told him that unless that behaviour changed I would never Come back. 5 months later, heard nothing. He has called me a couple of times and never mentioned it but did ask me to go and visit!? I refused and he said ‚Äò ok ‚Äò and changed the subject. I refuse to bring it up again after our talk -  it‚Äôs on him to address this. He has asked my brother if I‚Äôm okay and wondering what‚Äôs wrong!?  How can parents do this? if my partner was this way towards my offspring I would absolutely tear them to shreds (verbally) and they would be in no doubt where they stood.

He has an ex wife who I get on with very well, and two kids with her and he has a current wife who he has a child with. I am the oldest. I never ask my dad for anything. I was down visiting recently my SM made an issue about my dad buying me dinner - in front of family friends and others. The family friend asked what we are doing in terms of paying the bill and my step mother said ‚Äò there are three of us ‚Äò meaning her, my dad and her own daughter. The family friend said ‚Äò what about ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòME‚Äô..  I don‚Äôt know what my SM said but the family friends reaction was one of shock and she then looked at me sheepishly and apologised for me paying for myself. My dad then offered to pay for me and my SM started shouting at him in-front of everyone as to why he shouldn‚Äôt. 

1. I have never asked for anything in my life and ALWAYS pay my own way. 
2. I see my dad twice a year. 
3. My sister is constantly bailed out by her mum 
(My dad says he is ‚Äò powerless ‚Äò to stop her bailing her out) 

This triggered past issues: 

I asked about the next family holiday a year ago and was told by my step mother ‚Äò we are not organising a family holiday this year but you can come with us if you want ‚Äò . Not long after I was joking with a family friend who said to me ‚Äò just because you‚Äôre not invited on holiday ‚Äò. Nice. So I was an after thought and then my SM started telling me how expensive it would be. she then proceeded, right in front of me, to persuade her daughters not friends to come and she could get them a discount.

I would always be sat away from my dad on any special occasions when we go out. I would always be told where to sit at dinner - away from her my dad and my sister. This last Xmas I was told ‚Äò I‚Äôve put you there ‚Äò pointing to the end of the table‚Ä¶. She made a point of telling me this twice, but told no one else anything.

I even once saw her move my plate and swap with hers at the table so she was next to my dad‚Ä¶.. 

I don‚Äôt care about money, it‚Äôs the behaviour. I never ask for anything. My other siblings had issues too. 

I spoke to him the day after. He agreed with some points (‚Äò‚Äô I should have put my foot down ‚Äò‚Äô) but said I was being paranoid about others. He said he would address it.  I told him that unless that behaviour changed I would never Come back. 5 months later, heard nothing. He has called me a couple of times and never mentioned it but did ask me to go and visit!? I refused and he said ‚Äò ok ‚Äò and changed the subject. I refuse to bring it up again after our talk -  it‚Äôs on him to address this. He has asked my brother if I‚Äôm okay and wondering what‚Äôs wrong!?  How can parents do this? if my partner was this way towards my offspring I would absolutely tear them to shreds (verbally) and they would be in no doubt where they stood.

The problem is, he calls even when we are out for travel or date, or even when we are shopping at mart, and that's annoying since when he start calling, I am totally alone outside until coming back to home or arrive to destination. I said him call at home but not like over an hour when we are outside together.

Nobody willing to works and they get money from him, and keep expecting more and more. Even one of his brother married 3y ago and has 2kids and wife(my husband is even paying for them) plus dozens of cousins and uncles and aunts.........also wants to call and loan money or get help sometimes...
And furthermore, even after marriage he intervene every single issue going on there... like 'the fridge is broken, how to fix it ,or like, which floor they should put the fridge or... just like every single family and cousin and auntie problems to solve.. he is independent now and married, living abroad for 8years with a foreigner in a foreign country... I don't understand why he has to handle all this issues even at here until now... Why none of his other family member works or be responsible for thier life.

I said to him that ""I think you can't forever take care of all them like you are still living with them and they should be responsible for thier life. You have your life. And I agree you can take care of your parents, but not brothers and his family....they have to work""

","im at my grandparents house in trivandrum, Kerala for vacation. my parents are in chennai. 

at chennai, my parents would let me go on morning walks as early as 6 am. now that im here in Kerala i wanted to try walking here at 6 am. I've always wanted to explore this city by myself since i was a child. but my grandparents think its very unsafe cuz im a girl. 

i tried talking to my parents about this but turns out even they think its unsafe, saying that chennai is safer than trivandrum. i was born here and lived here till i was 7 yo, so i know the place well.

I'm turning 18 in 3 months and i just want to practice doing things by myself. my dad used to go cycling to school from 4th grade. and my parents often let my brother go cycling outside even until 9:30 pm. but me going for a morning walk is apparently unacceptable. 

i said i would share my location, and even postponed the time to 7 am. but still no. my parents are saying that I'm creating a scene and being dramatic for wanting to go alone. my grandmother keeps yapping on the phone to my parents talking about cases against women so that they are strongly convinced not to let me go.

So in all honesty, I'm just looking for some advice for my situation. I (18f) live with my three siblings (13f, 12f, and 10f) along with my grandmother (67f) and my aunt (27f).  My siblings and I live with my grandmother due to us being taken from our parents. But that's not what I want to talk about. See, about 8 months ago my grandma was laid off from her job. She worked at a hotel and they had changed management companies, this led to everyone working there to be laid off. Without her job to keep her occupied, she went off the deep end. She would go on these shopping sprees. Which led to large amounts of things in the house that isn't used. This included things like cleaning supplies, flower pots, seasoning, and canned foods. For a long while there were things all over the floor but I was able to make it work and kept the house semi clean. Then about 4 weeks ago, my grandma decided that she needed to clean out the pantry because she didn't like how I had it. Everything was pulled out; seasonings, canned food, bags of pre processed meat, and microwave noodles. Then it was left there. On the floor in the middle of the kitchen. I've tried talking to her about finishing it. And on the days that I ask, she says she'll finish it on that day but she never does. A few times I've tried to go in there and put it up myself only to be yelled at for not knowing where to put what. And recently she found that she could go to food banks and get large amounts of fresh food for free. So now, not only is the kitchen cluttered with cans, seasonings, and the like, but the fridges and freezers are full to the brim. Which may seem like a good thing until you learn that she goes to the food banks every week and gets the same large amount of fresh product.

71,1ck5f27,AITA for bringing up my friends love life with my brother?,"So, don't get me wrong, but talking about your relationship with others is a common thing to do with for some people, right?

Anywho, my friend, let's call her Sarah for now, has recently gotten into a romantic relationship with my older brother, who we'll name Kyler. Kyler and Sarah haven't told me a thing about their relationship at the time, so they've been secretly dating for a couple months now.

One morning, I woke up and decided to instantaneously go to the kitchen. Fortunately, Kyler was already up, getting ready for work, as the usual. He randomly walked up to me and asked, ""Hey, can Sarah stay here while I'm at work?"" and I nodded slowly, seemingly suspicious, but not asking questions.

A couple minutes after Kyler left for work, the doorbell rang. I opened it only to see Sarah. I allowed her in and we started talking in the living-room for a solid half an hour, before I suddenly mentioned her love life. She immediately froze, and gave me a glare. I didn't know what I did wrong at the time, so I remained confused.

After what felt like an eternity, Sarah started ranting, screaming, shouting about how I shouldn't mention her love life when I've been clearly seeing them flirting often. Her ranting went on for a solid ten minutes, without me saying a word. I allowed her to get everything out before I could say anything.

But before I could eventually say anything, Sarah shouted once again, running and darting out of the door, slamming it behind her, leaving me dumbfounded and frozen. I sat there for a solid ten minutes, not moving at all and just staring blankly at the door.

A couple weeks later, I'm here writing this. Sarah has blocked me on every social media that we have talked on, and refuses to talk about things and sort it out face to face. Kyler, on the other hand has been refusing to forgive me about it, so he has been continuously ignoring that topic every time I try to bring it up.

(Note: Me and Kyler have both been friends with Sarah for awhile, and had a pretty strong friendship. I've been seeing them flirt often, as well as going out often.)

72,1ck5caz,AITA for charging my bf for graphic designs?,"
I've been using Adobe for personal graphic design projects as a hobby. Recently, I created a logo and a black and white label for my boyfriend's business at no cost. However, as his business has expanded, he's now looking for new packaging and a color label. When I initially did the work for free, he was quite demanding and even made comments about how long it took me to finish the project, which was four weeks.

I proposed creating another label for him, but this time for a fee. He found this idea absurd and refused, arguing that if I was going to charge him, he should start charging me for the free meals he brings home from his job. If I'm not willing to extend ""free boyfriend perks,"" then he feels he shouldn't either.

He has decided to have his cousin, a professional graphic designer, handle the work instead. I'm okay with this arrangement, but I'm left wondering if I was unreasonable in my request.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-04,"AITA for charging my bf for graphic designs?

73,1ck5axg,AITA; Am I the  asshole here in this roommate scene?,"AITA, Hi everyone.
I moved in to this 2 bedroom apartment with an Indian roommate. I communicated well with him before I moved in about all possible scenarios. I told him he needs to live alone and I want only two people in apartment. He sent me message saying that he will move alone and nobody will be with him. On the move in day, he told me that his friend is moving with him for a week or so who happened to stay on living room for 2 months and 6 days. I asked him to pay one month rent and utilities bill which his friend agreed. He was understanding and he paid that. But my roommate told me on Jan 26 that his gf needs to move in with him. I had already talked with him before we moved in that I won‚Äôt be comfortable with his gf in apartment. He moved in his gf when I was out of country in February. I became generous and let her stay since he mentioned it was temporary. I asked him to pay $100 extra since his gf moved in. I didn‚Äôt make him pay extra for Feb coz his friend had already paid 1/3 of the rent. Now he is moving out in May. He said that his gf will be staying only a week or two in May, so he is not paying extra $100.  He wants everything to be on his favor. We have a year lease that ends on Jan 2025. Yesterday was rent due and I asked him to send money so that I can make money order. I made money order and paid full rent since it was due yesterday. He is moving on may last and told me to deduct his rent from security deposit. Meaning, He wants me to pay his security deposit back to him as a rent. I told him that a replacement that he finds will be responsible for his security deposit. I am also trying to find a replacement so that he can get his deposit from him. 
I feel like I became flexible enough for him but he is putting me in crappy situation. I am not signing roommate release form. And if possible, I am thinking to take this matter to small claim court to make him pay rent for the rest of the lease terms if he is not willing to give up his security deposit. This is what I want: if a replacement comes before he moves out, he will get his deposit back if not, he has to give up his deposit. 

What are some legal suggestions for me? 
Thank you!

76,1ck3g2g,AITA: My friends brought alcohol even though I asked them not to. ,"The other day myself and four other friends decided to go to an escape room after school.

We planned it in our group chat and for context we are all girls under the age of 18 (16-17) living in the UK. Two of my friends drink alcohol quite regularly. Which I think is fine considering they are almost 18 and often do so at home or around adults where they are safe. However, in terms of my personal beliefs I am against underage drinking and the premise of getting drunk in general. It's just a personal choice, but I respect their free will to drink on their own time.

They were joking about bringing vodka/alcohol to our outing but me and my other friend both said if they brought alcohol we'd rather not come. During the escape room I noticed something and so I sniffed the bottle and it smelt strongly of vodka. So I asked, ""Is this vodka?"" And, they said yeah. So I walked away as I was quite upset that they decided to knowingly disregard my boundaries and I felt that I was being disrespected. Although as I became visibly upset they were all walking after me telling me it's not a big deal. Looking back my reaction was definitely not entirely appropriate, I could have been calmer (because I was raising my voice). But, I had never been put in a scenario like this before so I was quite overwhelmed and was having trouble sorting through my emotions.

My drunk friend proceeded to say, ""I'm fine, look I'm fine so everything is fine."" In which I proceeded to reply, ""Well it's not about you, obviously you are fine."" She didn't understand what I meant. She just moved here and I don't think she's ever had a friend who's shared a different belief system to her.

When I think personally the other girl only drank it because someone else brought it otherwise she would have been fine sober.

It was quite amazing to see her turn so quick. But, really I was angry at her even if I didn't make it clear.

78,1ck2jcw,AITA for not wanting my mil to visit a couple times a week to see my daughter?,"I gave birth to my daughter January this year and ever since then my mil has become more controlling than she was before. She doesn't respect boundaries. Let me give you a few examples.

Whenever we have guests over to see my daugther, my mil always invites herself and makes it all about her. She wants my daughter to only smile and play with her. She doesn't give my guests a chance to have time with my daughter because she's always trying to get her attention. I can see how annoyed people get with her but no one says anything.

My husband is a baptized Catholic and I'm a Christian. My husband and I don't believe in going to church although we do believe in God and we decided not to baptize our daughter. My mil however is a dedicated church goer and she told my husband that she wants HIM to baptize our daughter when she turns 6 months old because SHE is a church goer and she would look bad if her granddaughter isn't baptized.

She visits a couple times a week for an hour or two and she always wakes up the baby on purpose by talking loudly and when the baby is awake she overstimulates her by talking way too much.

She's not very hygienic, I caught her many times not washing her hands when handling my daughter even though we remind her multiple times to wash her hands. She even wiped her dirty spectacles on my baby's blanket. I was so shocked and speechless when she did this.

Last weekend my mil invited us over for lunch and they were burning an outdoor fire and she was holding our daughter close to the fire. I told my husband to tell her it's not good for the baby and he said don't worry, it's not that bad. Then they burned an even bigger fire and my mil couldn't be bothered. My husband then came to his senses and took my daughter away. I feel so helpless in this situation because I'm English and my husband is Polish and I don't speak the language in order to deal with these situations properly.

Every single gift my daughter has received was opened by my mil. She would just take it and open it in front of me to show me what my daughter received. I know it's petty but I would like to be the one to open the gifts with my husband as we're the parents. My husband acknowledges that his mother is a problem but says that's just how she is and she's over excited about having a granddaughter. I understand this but the health and wellbeing of our daughter is priority. Everytime she comes over I have terrible anxiety. My parents live far away so I'm all alone here and only my husband speaks English so it's hard to get advice or vent to anyone about how I'm feeling.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-04,"AITA for not wanting my mil to visit a couple times a week to see my daughter?

Recently, my husband and his friend (39M) who's a mechanic recently just finished ""modding"" (I think thats the correct term) his car, and I can't tell my looks, but by how it sounds. The engine thingy is a lot *louder* and this bothers me for a few reasons, 

A) We're most likely bothering the neighbors

B) The car is louder and faster, and my husband is a good driver, but it doesn't seem very safe to me that he takes our kids on rides in said car since he's taken a liking to driving very fast. i dont want them in any type of car accidents or anything. 

I've brought it up with him, askign for him to drive a bit less menace like with my kids in the car, and he said he will, *but* that it's just fun and they enjoy the ride too.

since my mother started to make her own wholemeal bread with a machine and my father joined her, i simply bought bread for me and my brother every day and my father gives part of it to ""make the dogs go to the back yard"" (even dought i say that it isn't necessary because we were doing it for years and the dog understand that they have to leave when we say so) and i didn't mind that much because i would just go and get the bread for the next day anyways, but since my brother moved out to live his life, i had to get bread just for me, and because i am lazy i bought bread for a couple of days.

as you may have guessed, the problem with me, personally, comes when they still give bread to the dogs! now my mother joining the ""chore"", and because i prefer to avoid the conflict, explicitly with my mom because of how she is, i just started to hide the bread around the kitchen.

at some point my mother found out that i hid the bread and we talked, i simply argued that we shouldn't give bread in the first place to the dogs because they (for years) understand that they have to go to the backyard to come in around sunset (they even scratch the door when times come) and that i am buying the bread to not buy it every day exactly because i don't want to buy it every day, she argued that ""they don't eat anything for all of the day!"" (it's not like they have all the night to anyways or that they exactly don't eat to then eat the bread that they give them every day) and that i can simply buy more bread.

today either my mom (probably she) or my dad has found where i hide the bread again (2nd time) and i am thinking of simply stopping buying and starting to eat an oath meal or something like that.

He said they would be at our place ""a little after noon"", they have to drive their son to work first, who starts at noon and doesn't have a driver's licence yet and then they would drive to our place. A little after noon, considering he needs a little more than an hour to get to me, is 1-2 pm in my book. This is the time that we planned out entire day around. 

He then had the idea to go to a big grocery store that's close to us and really cheap, but which they usually wouldn't go to because apart from being close to me, they would never drive there otherwise. I told him to call me when they're close and if our baby is asleep at that point, go ahead and do the shopping first, but if he's awake, to please come visit us first and THEN do the shopping.

He doesn't call, he decides without consulting me to do the shopping first. It's a giant ass grocery store and they take their sweet time, announcing their arrival at 4 pm. 

I told him to go home, because at this point, the baby was asleep and my husband has left to go run errands that we otherwise wouldn't have had time for if we waited any longer or even entertained them. Theoretically, they could have dropped by, but they would've only seen me instead of all of us and it would've been a very short visit because they arrived so late. 

He was obviously miffed about that as he doesn't get to see his (first and only) grandson very often, but I told him with a baby and errands/obligations to take care of, I don't have the liberty to just wait around for visitors. If you say you'll be here around noon but effectively show up at 4, don't be mad if I turn you away. AITA?

ETA: I texted him asking for an ETA and informing him that the baby is about to fall asleep and he likely won't see him if they take any longer, no response. Called him a little after that, again asking for ETA, he was clearly busy with shopping and only brushed me off with an ""I'll call you when we're done"".


ETA2: For those saying I should've accommodated them just because he's my father and that's what's expected: My father and I have never been particularly close. I would describe our relationship as more like a standard uncle/niece relationship in terms of closeness. I don't feel obligated to put up with a whole lotta shit from him, and I draw the line much sooner compared to other, closer relatives. I texted and called before pulling the plug on his visit, that was the extent of my courtesy.


**FINAL EDIT:**

Thanks for the comments and the lively discussion. Those who voted YTA unfortunately couldn't give any arguments that would convince me of their viewpoint, because most were based on the opinion that since he's my father, I somehow owed it to him to invite them in. 

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, here we go again: **I am not close with my father.** Because many obviously don't get how I don't feel any sort of daughterly obligation to accommodate him, let me be perfeclty blunt: There are many people in my family, for whom I'd go to hell and back, and a guy who used to beat his wife and kids just isn't one of them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, here we go again: **I am not close with my father.** Because many obviously don't get how I don't feel any sort of daughterly obligation to accommodate him, let me be perfeclty blunt: There are many people in my family, for whom I'd go to hell and back, and a guy who used to beat his wife and kids just isn't one of them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Those who based their judgements on other arguments, I partially agree with you and admit there was def pettiness or punishment involved to a certain degree. My mood was ruined because we squandered the majority of a beautiful, sunny day and I just couldn't find it in me to be the bigger person. 

Thank you and good night. ",0.0,1.0351918935775757,1,0
86,1ck114f,AITA for ‚Äúcopying‚Äù my friend,"My friend sent me a long message so I‚Äôm gonna be talking about this in points, bear with me!!
 First point- My friend recently got her second and third ear piercings, and I‚Äôve wanted to get them for a while as well. I got my second a while back, but I changed the earrings a little too early, and I got piercing bumps as a result. Recently, I tried to open the second piercings, and only the right ear opened. So I booked an appointment to get my other opened, but I missed the appointment and couldn‚Äôt get it done. Recently, I got a gift card that was 60$. And I booked an appointment to only get my second piercing on my left ear opened, but the store said I‚Äôd still have to pay for both piercings regardless if their only piercing me once. and the cheapest piercing option was 30$. so naturally, I got both them done, not even thinking about my other friend in the process. She says i copied her because I didn‚Äôt give her any notice. 
Second point- She says she feels as if Ive been copying her for a long time, and some time ago we had a conversation where I told her mirroring peoples energy and or habits is my personality. In my opinion, it‚Äôs normal to do this. and whenever i do it, most of the times i don‚Äôt even think, and i certainly to not think of wanting to be her. 
Third point- This is a trio argument. The friend who‚Äôs mad at me is A, and she doesn‚Äôt know how to communicate well, so she told me the only way she‚Äôs comfortable talking about this is if I wrote her notes. And friend B and A have always been closer and whenever any argument happens, they‚Äôll leave me out of everything and only talk to each other. and if i make any mistake, instead of telling me, they distance themselves. Friend B always takes friend A‚Äôs side!! I asked friend b if she was mad at me too, and she said ‚Äúkinda, i‚Äôm more mad for our friend ykn‚Äù 
Fourth point- Friend A didn‚Äôt even tell me what was going on and how she felt, i had to ask friend B what was going on. and friend B wrote in the paragraph that she sent me, that friend A asked people what they would do if they were in her situation, and even her mom and sister said to drop me.

87,1ck1145,AITA for asking my parents unfair questions?,"So I (17m) learned last year that I was adopted by my adoptive dad. I always thought he was my bio dad. My parents never told me. A few months later I found a letter my dad wrote before he died, while my mom was pregnant with me, and in that letter it explained he had no contact with his bio family and he wanted me to have no contact with them either, and that he was the reason, not mom. He wanted me to blame him if I blamed anyone. He also said how much he loved me and how much he wanted to raise me. He also explained that he had three best friends who were the only family he recognized, and they were his brothers in everything except blood and he knew they would always be a big part of my life. And they would tell me all about him.

Only my parents didn't keep them in my life. So I grew up not knowing about my dad or the people he called brothers. It was such a bombshell and I struggled to process and I didn't forgive so my parents decided we needed therapy together.

Once in therapy they explained some things, at least how they wanted to. They said the reason to not keep my uncles around was they felt like it was preventing me from knowing my adoptive dad as my real dad. Mom said she didn't want me to ever tell him he wasn't my real dad. She didn't want me caring more for dad's best friends than the man raising me. Dad admitted to being jealous and wanting the three guys from my dad's life out of my life, so I could be his kid and he wouldn't forever be my stepdad. I was 2 when this all went down and I was 2 when the adoption happened.

My parents wanted us to move on from this. Mom said she felt like this was a tiny blip in the ocean. That we had been close and they had been great parents to me and to my younger siblings. She also said my younger siblings would never recover if I walked away from my family. Dad said he didn't like how angry I am and he felt like I was going too far with this.

The counselor told them there might not be a way back. She also told them these are the direct consequences of their actions. She said there's always a reason they encourage parents to tell their kids they were adopted and why they always say it's better to know family than not. My parents claim to understand but then act like I owe them forgiveness.

Last week during our session I asked them some tough questions. I asked them how they would like it if something happened to me and my future kids never knew I existed and they never knew them. I asked my adoptive dad if he'd like being in my dad's shoes. If he'd be okay with mom letting husband number 3 adopt his kids. Then I dared him to ask her to do that because he thinks it's no big deal. I asked either of them if they would be okay with being in my uncles places.

I get physically sick if I'm too high and start to get vertigo. I avoid things like glass elevators, balconies and being too close to full length windows. I haven't really seen it as a big problem since I am able to do these things if necessary even if it's uncomfortable.

I've been working at my current job for five years and I'm good friends with my coworkers. We don't really spend time together outside work and mostly talk about current events and work related stuff while socialising at work. Because of this and because there is nothing in my work environment that would cause me symptoms, I have never told them how bad my vertigo is.

The problem arised couple of days ago when it was my 30th birthday. My company celebrates milestone birthdays so there was cake and decorations for me. At one point my boss declares that they have all pitched in and gotten me a big gift. I was feeling a bit embarrased because of the attention but happy that they cared enough to do so. My boss handed me an envelope and I opened it. Once I saw what the gift was, I was really shocked. It was a gift card for a hot air balloon ride. I tried to act like I was happy but just the thought of being in a hot air balloon made me feel sick. Apparently it really showed on my face so my coworkers asked if I didn't like it. I put on a brave face and said it was great and I was just surprised and thanked them because I didn't want to make them feel bad.

Later one coworker came to me and asked me about the gift and I confessed that I have bad vertigo and will definately not use the gift card. She was really upset, not because I didn't like the gift but because I have never told them about my fear. I just never thought it was something others needed to know.

She thinks I'm an AH since I (in her opinion) don't trust my coworkers to share personal info and lied about liking the gift. I don't think she'll tell the others but I don't know what to say when someone eventually asks if I did the trip.

Jane read Braxton‚Äôs graduation speech last night while we were at our mom‚Äôs house for dinner and it ended up in a massive argument.

5 years ago, my husband (33M) and I hosted an exchange student, Justin (15M at the time, now 20M) who is from the Philippines. Justin loves basketball and when we found this out, we were excited for Braxton (who was 6 at the time) because he had started to play basketball but no one else in the family was really interested. This quickly evolved into my husband and I driving Justin and Braxton to either the gym or a local sports center every day to play, I would normally supervise as I wasn‚Äôt working and had no kids at the time. By the end of the year, Justin and Braxton grew close and after Justin left, they would still talk on the phone, my husband and I would help them speak to each other.

In Braxton‚Äôs graduation speech, the first person he thanks, and the one with the most written about them is Justin. He speaks about how Justin is his role model and like a bigger brother and how he‚Äôs helped him with basketball.

Jane got upset when reading this, she asked Braxton why he would put Justin over his ‚Äúown blood‚Äù, he explained that he wants to be like Justin when he grow up. Justin recently started teaching him Tagalog, he said he admires how smarter Justin was for knowing different languages and spoken about all what he admires in Justin.

Jane ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù he re-write it and include family first, but he said Justin was family to him, she argued some more before stepping out of the kitchen.

Jane got upset when reading this, she asked Braxton why he would put Justin over his ‚Äúown blood‚Äù, he explained that he wants to be like Justin when he grow up. Justin recently started teaching him Tagalog, he said he admires how smarter Justin was for knowing different languages and spoken about all what he admires in Justin.

Jane ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù he re-write it and include family first, but he said Justin was family to him, she argued some more before stepping out of the kitchen.

I went in the living room after a bit to check on her, we‚Äôre really close and normally she opens up to me. She started to whine about how she does so much for him and how he only likes Justin because he‚Äôs a ‚Äúcool kid‚Äù. I brought up how I drive him places and she whined about how she ‚Äúhas 7 kids‚Äù, she continued to whine about his speech and I told her to stop whining and act like an adult. She got angry at me and started to argue and hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since last night, where she seemed angry at me. She won‚Äôt pick up my calls. AITA?",0.0,0.05089535936713219,0,1

95,1cjxkh7,AITA for telling my wife to do her chores?,"I, (24M), have been married to my wife Amelia (26F) for 4 years, (yes I know we married fairly young.). I work a consultant type job which requires me to have periods/roughly a month where I work 70\~ hours a week We don't have kids and my wife does not have a job. Currently I'm in one of these periods (typing this on my lunch) Me and my wife usually do a 70/40 split in terms of housework but in weeks like this I do next to none because 10 hours a day (no weekends) of mostly standing/moving about means that when I get home I usually collapse on the couch and then do some prep for tomorrow. Recently my wife hasn't been doing even 50% of the chores, which is fine for a bit. We all have our ups and downs and I've never had an issue with a messy house. I've been microwaving some frozen stuff/not eating for dinner.

My wife recently brought up to me that she was feeling overwhelmed with all the mess in the house and asked me to help out. I'm not in the house for 12ish hours including commute and lunch break so I don't really care how the house looks. I told her if she wanted the house to be clean she could just do her chores. She went tight-lipped and told me she'd let that go because I was under a lot of stress. I went to sleep soon after and got up 6 and left for work at 7:30 before she woke up. I got a text a few hours ago that she was dissapointed in how I'd reacted to her expressing her needs. I get that she's stressed, I do. But I'm doing my job. Is it so unfair to expect her to do hers?

1) As a consultant I get leased to different businesses for anywhere from a few days to a month. My schedule can vary from getting a month with only a few days of non-stop work and the rest off (I'm talking I do not have time to come and go from my house , I have to get a hotel room as close as possible) or a steady few weeks of a normal schedule to this. 2) Pay: Numbers vary but in general money is not an issue. Yes, I do pay for everything 3) 70/40 was a mistake. Its somewhere between 60-70/30-40. 4) No, I do not care about the mess and I only have one thing which is do not leave wine glasses out. If you're gonna invite friends over to the house when I'm not there don't leave alcohol/drugs/vapes out (i hate intoxicating substances) My wife does drink, unlike me, so we have a designated cupboard for the alcohol keep it in there. 5) No I am not mother gothel.

We‚Äôve been friends for 2 years and moved in together 6 months ago. She started dating a new guy (18M) around the same time we moved, and ever since then, we‚Äôve been fighting.

We‚Äôve had some issues, but it was never something that bothered me, because who doesn‚Äôt, right?

We became friends because she said she liked the fact that I could own up to something and apologize. But now I‚Äôm realizing she never really apologizes or even thinks she‚Äôs in the wrong.

An example of one of our fights:

She needed a hair clip, and I let her use one my mother had given to me. I told her, 'This is my mother's favorite, and it means a lot to me, so please be careful.' She broke it, and when I asked her to apologize, she said, 'No, it‚Äôs not like I broke it on purpose.' She never apologized for that.

Back to the current problem. A month before we‚Äôre supposed to renew our contract, she told me she was moving. She‚Äôs supposed to move out officially in 10 days, and she‚Äôs already packed most of her stuff.

I wake up today and find my soap dish and extension cord missing. When I texted her about it, she said I gave her the cord, and I informed her, 'No, I let you borrow it, but if you need it, that‚Äôs fine. But I want my soap dish back.'

We‚Äôve been friends for 2 years and moved in together 6 months ago. She started dating a new guy (18M) around the same time we moved, and ever since then, we‚Äôve been fighting.

We‚Äôve had some issues, but it was never something that bothered me, because who doesn‚Äôt, right?

We became friends because she said she liked the fact that I could own up to something and apologize. But now I‚Äôm realizing she never really apologizes or even thinks she‚Äôs in the wrong.

An example of one of our fights:

She needed a hair clip, and I let her use one my mother had given to me. I told her, 'This is my mother's favorite, and it means a lot to me, so please be careful.' She broke it, and when I asked her to apologize, she said, 'No, it‚Äôs not like I broke it on purpose.' She never apologized for that.

Back to the current problem. A month before we‚Äôre supposed to renew our contract, she told me she was moving. She‚Äôs supposed to move out officially in 10 days, and she‚Äôs already packed most of her stuff.

I wake up today and find my soap dish and extension cord missing. When I texted her about it, she said I gave her the cord, and I informed her, 'No, I let you borrow it, but if you need it, that‚Äôs fine. But I want my soap dish back.'

For context, my mother bought me that dish, and yes, it‚Äôs not a big deal, but I live abroad, so things from back home matter to me.

102,1cjvhaz,AITA for standing my ground?,"Lil'bro has spent the last 6yrs barely talking to me, and after moving back in town, mom expected us to play ""happy family"", but he refuses to talk to me.

When my dogs died, he didn't bother to send a ""sorry for your loss"", and I got really hurt. To me, it shouldn't matter our standing, I was mourning, and and he had known the dogs. Around the same time, a relative of ours who lived in another town got sick, and it fell upon my husband to get my mother there. When they were away, he invited me for lunch, I went, but was also trying to hire nurses for our relative and lodging for my mom and husband. The spoiled brat got annoyed that I wasn't discussing this new game with him, and took the phone away from me as if I were a child.

That got me really pissed and I started ranting all I thought about him and that he had no hint of autonomous thinking because he just kept repeating the things our mother said about me without checking if any of that was true or what was my take on the story, and how he got his head so stuck inside his belly he didn't really care for anyone else besides him, but he also didn't realize that this same attitude made him unreliable and that had been the reason why mom hadn't trusted him to go with her to help set up the care for our relative. I said many harsh things but nothing untrue - yet he was not ready to hear what I had to say about him. We had gone to the restaurant by foot, and returned arguing - at some point there was nothing left to say, so we walked in silence, until I looked around and he had taken another path entirely.

After that, we never talked again; later I found out he was upset with me because I had ""abandoned"" him and only IF I apologized he'd talk to me again. I got conflicted because we are past our 30's- grown ups talk things through and if anything, we both hurt each other (it wasn't a monologue).

I had agreed on meeting him to talk things through - apologize, IF we got to a point where I could agree on, AND what was most important for me was to know how we would stand from that point forward. Just going back to what we were doing before wouldn't work, because it would be a matter of time before we blew up again. I got to the restaurant, explained to him why I wouldn't just apologize and I asked him on what terms did he see our relationship moving forward. He just got up and left - and it took me all of my poker face to not start laughing out loud at him there and then, because he was trying to hurt me back the same way he said I hurt him. I felt sorry for him, but still stand by my decision, except that I'm getting married this summer and my mother keeps nagging me that I should make amends with him ""for her sake"".

He felt offended, my mother felt offended, I should have felt offended, and I'm still being required to apologize. Not going to, just like he never expressed his condolences for my dogs.

104,1cjv8ff,AITA for dancing with a girl at a club while in a relationship?,"I (29M) am in a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) of five years.  We are doing six months‚Äô long-distance due to her work, so I have had time recently to reconnect with my friends.

Me and my friends have always liked clubbing and dancing.  We have always gone to clubs/raves to dance and enjoy EDM.  I stopped doing this so much when I got in a relationship and when COVID hit (dropped down to 3-4 times a year) but since I‚Äôve had more time on my hands since we went long-distance, I‚Äôve recaptured this activity with a few of my closest friends.

I have literally never hooked up with someone at a club/rave.  I go to dance and have fun, not to hook up.

Last week, I was out with my friend (29M) to a drum and bass warehouse rave and we met two girls who were vibing the same as we were - we were in the midst of dancing and our energies just matched.  So we ended up all dancing together as a group.

There was nothing sexual at all about the dancing, we were just skanking out to the music.

After the event finished, we all decided to kick on together to an after party.  The after party was more of a house-music vibe, so a bit more chill/slow.  We were all on the dance floor again and a sort of salsa-style beat came on.  That‚Äôs when one of the girls reached out her hand to dance with me.  I took her hand, spun her a few times and we danced together facing each other for maybe 2-3 minutes.  During that time it was just basic partner dancing, nothing remotely sexual.  She didn‚Äôt seem to be a very confident dancer so I just went slow and kept it simple and fun. When that song ended I said ‚Äúthanks for the dance‚Äù and then we all continued to dance/party until the club closed.

We all exchanged instagram details at the end so we could keep in touch.

Today I was chatting to my girlfriend and I was telling her how much fun I had at the rave and after party.  We usually tell each other all about our day in immense detail when we chat and can honestly chat for hours.  While recounting my night I mentioned that I danced with one of the girls we met when the salsa beat was playing and my girlfriend got very upset.  She said it was inappropriate for me to be dancing with other girls and it was disrespectful and that it is a slippery slope to infidelity.  She said she is fine with me going out and dancing, but not partner dancing one-on-one with another girl.

I was a bit taken aback as it was entirely platonic dancing, and I said that if she saw the platonic nature of the dancing then she wouldn‚Äôt have been concerned.  But my girlfriend was pretty angry and said what I did was a breach of trust and she felt disrespected and belittled.  I apologised for it and I‚Äôm genuinely sorry that what I did hurt her.

She has been pretty angry at me since that phone call.  I don‚Äôt really see the problem though.  It was an entirely innocent, platonic dance.

Diana‚Äôs been freaking out for months over it because it‚Äôs basically their only grade this semester and her teacher‚Äôs made it clear that nobody is exempt from doing it.

It‚Äôs okay to be anxious but if she drops out of things over it then she‚Äôs not gonna go far in life at all, much less become a doctor.

I‚Äôm writing this because I told my best friend ‚ÄúElise‚Äù about this today and she is fully on my sister‚Äôs side. Elise says that she knows as a person with anxiety, you can be given as many logical reasons as possible to not be anxious but anxiety just isn‚Äôt something you can control.

It‚Äôs like a routine for him to take care of his cat and plants so I don‚Äôt really think about those things at home. 

He recently went on vacation again for a week or so, and I took care of the cat but didn‚Äôt think about watering the plants because he‚Äôd only mentioned the cat. Since it was always the cat I would look after when he was gone, the plant thing was new and I completely forgot about it. 

When he was back he saw the plants dehydrated and some of them were dying. He lashed out at me asking why I didn‚Äôt water the plants, I said I didn‚Äôt give it much thought because 1) you didn‚Äôt mention them, 2) I have never had plants so I didnt even realize I had to take care of them. He said he didn‚Äôt have to say anything about it and that it is common sense to water plants.

So im a 21F college student and my roommate, a foreign woman in her 30s, was a random placement back in November after my old roommates moved out and she moved from a different unit due to cockroaches bothering her. I own almost every single thing in the apartment since I lived there first and alone for a little while. She is nice, but generally really inconsiderate as a roommate. She has had many people and guys over, stained my white furniture, had s*x with a random guy on my couch while I was in my room like 6 feet away, frequently gets really drunk in the apartment and leaves crap like open chip dip and raw chicken out overnight, changes the air conditioning to 78 degrees anytime I look away (it‚Äôs in TX), and over spring break I went back home and she made such a mess that we had a fruit fly invasion. 

I spent a lot of money and time clearing the fruit flies, which she thought were gross and said were really bad in her room. I told her we need to keep the sink clean and she has done a pretty poor job of it, but the fruit flies haven‚Äôt come back thankfully. 

Here‚Äôs the kicker - lately she has started smoking cigarettes a ton. I do not smoke but I can deal with it as long as it‚Äôs outside on our balcony and is ONLY outside.

113,1cju2vy,AITA for exploding at my boyfriend for not wanting to attend my cousins wedding? ,"I (f24) have a younger cousin who just got married yesterday. She had a small courthouse marriage which I did not attend because I was working. But she is having the party today. She called me about a week before to ask me to come to the party and said my boyfriend (22) was invited as well, I asked if he wanted to come because I know he isn't the most social person in the world, he has a hard time talking to people he doesn't know and sometimes gets uncomfortable, so I would completely understand if he had told me no, but he said yes, which kind of surprised me to be honest. 

Fast forward to today, day of the party, he is working today but still has time to come to the dinner, we had agreed I would leave the party quickly to go get him as he is still getting a drivers license. 

As he left to go to work in the morning I woke up and saw that he was wearing shorts and a t shirt and reminded him to not forget to take a change of clothes for the party later, he immediately got defensive and said he didn't want to leave work wearing such ""fancy"" clothing as he stated himself, to which I replied he could just get changed in the car if that was the problem, I even offered to prepare his clothes and take them for him so he wouldn't have to do it in a hurry as he still had to catch the bus. 

All through the conversation he kept telling me not to get mad which just ended up making me grow furious everytime he said. Then he said ""why are you getting mad over this? I don't have to follow your ass everywhere you go."" And this is where I exploded I tried explaining to him that this wasn't about him not wanting to come but about the fact that he could have told me so when I first asked and not wait until the day of, yet he just insisted on saying the same thing over and over and again and this is where I might be the asshole, I got fed up listening to his excuses and told him I should have seen it coming because he NEVER attends any of my family gatherings/parties while I, on the other hand, have gone to every single one I've been invited to, including a wedding where the only people I know where him, his sister and his parents. After I said that he got really mad at me and just left.

I confirmed to my cousin he would be there and now I'm going to have to explain to everyone why he isn't actually coming and I'm not even sure what to say to anyone. 
So am I the asshole for exploding on him like that? 

Edit: I feel like I need to clarify that the problem here for him isn't going to the actualy party but the fact that he has to wear pants and a shirt.

so, i (21F) am in a loving family with my mom (45F). we have always been close with her being present for most of my accomplishments and major events, and i truly love and appreciate her. 

recently, i got into college, got a bf and am going through an internship. so i regularly go on dates on the weekends since i basically work 9-5 now. this meant i went out w her way less than i used to when i was single. and since i have started internship, i have been planning more outings w friends now since i dont get to see them in college. 

i mostly spend the day with my mom if i dont have any plans/if its a special day. and so ive not been prioritising time with her as much, and there is no one to accompany her on her days off. 

the breaking point came last week, when i already had a date set and had to leave soon. my mom came in my room and asked what we were doing that day. i told her we could have a quick lunch, then told her i alr had a date planned. she then got pretty pissed and told me to move my date to dinner although i was already kinda late and pushing the date in order to make some time to have lunch with her. 

she said that i shouldnt be so selfish and prioritising time towards my friends n bf but leave more time for her instead. after that, i just left for the date since i was alr late and she stayed home. today as i was leaving, she told me to say sorry for abandoning her to be home alone. matter of fact, i left since my brother was home that day, and i thought she could still spend time with him if she needed company. however i did not raise that and just apologised since it would have escalated the situation instead.

this is my first time living a 9-5 lifestyle and i dont want to miss out on my friend‚Äôs lives and i miss them alot as well. i understand her loneliness since she does not have friends that she hangs out with since we are immigrants. but i still dont feel like its fair to demand me to push my plans backwards for her. and i dont understand why it had to be with me and not my brother, who often gets to have his own alone time without being relentlessly hammered. i am definitely the favourite child in the family, dont get me wrong, my parents show a pretty stark difference in paying more attention on me than my brother.

the breaking point came last week, when i already had a date set and had to leave soon. my mom came in my room and asked what we were doing that day. i told her we could have a quick lunch, then told her i alr had a date planned. she then got pretty pissed and told me to move my date to dinner although i was already kinda late and pushing the date in order to make some time to have lunch with her. 

she said that i shouldnt be so selfish and prioritising time towards my friends n bf but leave more time for her instead. after that, i just left for the date since i was alr late and she stayed home. today as i was leaving, she told me to say sorry for abandoning her to be home alone. matter of fact, i left since my brother was home that day, and i thought she could still spend time with him if she needed company. however i did not raise that and just apologised since it would have escalated the situation instead.

this is my first time living a 9-5 lifestyle and i dont want to miss out on my friend‚Äôs lives and i miss them alot as well. i understand her loneliness since she does not have friends that she hangs out with since we are immigrants. but i still dont feel like its fair to demand me to push my plans backwards for her. and i dont understand why it had to be with me and not my brother, who often gets to have his own alone time without being relentlessly hammered. i am definitely the favourite child in the family, dont get me wrong, my parents show a pretty stark difference in paying more attention on me than my brother.

i dont know if im just blabbering on, but this is the context of my situation. AITA for abandoning my mother on a weekend?",0.0,0.012601683847606182,0,1

I am a soon bride to be and I will be having my wedding with family and friends and I have a member of my family who is possibly sabotaging my wedding. A family member of mine let‚Äôs call her Tammy, is upset that I didn‚Äôt include them as a bridesmaid and insisted that they be a matron of honor. I still love them and want them to be there for me on my big day.

I do have a valid reason to say no‚Ä¶Tammy is not 100% of me getting married and I don‚Äôt want them to be in my wedding if they are not for our happiness. Tammy feels like my fianc√© is not the right person for me. More financial than anything (My fianc√© doesn‚Äôt make a lot of money but he does work). 

Fast Forward: I wanted certain family members to be escorted down the aisle at my wedding on both side. For my side the person let‚Äôs call her Holly and Holly was all for walking down the aisle to represent me. Then I told Holly who was on my side who would be escorting them down the aisle. Tammy made several previous comments that they didn‚Äôt want to walk with them but in a ‚Äújoking way‚Äù. 

I recently reached out to Tammy and asked if she could wear a certain color (one of my color schemes) for the wedding to match with the those who are on my side of the family because my bridal party will be wearing the colors of the wedding. However, instead of responding to me directly, Tammy decided to have a private discussion without me knowing to Holly to were Holly calls me (who agreed that they would walk down the aisle to represent me) and tells me that she talked to Tammy about what I sent in a private conversation and proceeds to say ‚Äú I don‚Äôt feel comfortable walking down the isle because of a personal issue that she is  experiencing.‚Äù I knew this personal issue ahead of time and if Holly didn‚Äôt no longer want to walk down to represent me she could told me herself. I responded ‚Äú I understand and that‚Äôs fine‚Äùand Holly said sorry and I hope I still love her and she will still be present at my wedding. After the call ended I noticed that after the conversation with Holly, all of a sudden, they change their mind of walking down the aisle. I put two and two together and realized that Tammy was planning to ruin my special day because they didn‚Äôt get their way and is not apart of my wedding. A later message was sent from Tammy stating ‚ÄúNow that so &so is out of the wedding, let me know if there is something else I can do‚Äù.

I am just at a loss for words and honestly just hurt about all of it. I don‚Äôt know how to respond to any of this even if I want to say anything to Tammy at this point.

Lisa does not enjoy going out to the bars or drinking (not sober just simply doesn‚Äôt enjoy it) and rather be at home. Their other friends and I do and we quickly bonded over that. Historically, we have made plans to go out every once in a while  and Lisa will say she‚Äôll go and ultimately will bail,say it‚Äôs okay to go without them but still gets upset if we still decide to go ( has happened many times). 

 Lisa has explicitly stated that they don‚Äôt like that I make plans with their friends since they were their friends first. I understand her reasoning but also I feel like a good friend wouldnt see it like that. 

That being said, I feel like I‚Äôm constantly having to walk on eggshells when wanting to plan a night out.  Every time we as a group try to plan something, a big argument happens with Lisa. This is where Lisa will say we are selfish and bad friends and make us feel bad. We do plan a lot more things with Lisa that isn‚Äôt involving bars and drinking so we can all hang out together then we do plan to go out. It just seems impossible to not upset her.

125,1cjsdbo,AITA for using my roommate‚Äôs storage unit,"Hey Reddit. Long time lurker, first time poster. I (19M) have a roommate (20M) who I live with throughout the academic school year.  We were randoms last year and have been close friends ever since then.  The way our living arrangement is that we split chores equally. I pay for all of our groceries and most of the entertainment for the apartment (ie the tv, party games, and streaming services). As much as I appreciate my roommate, he does not contribute to the apartment short of doing his half of the chores.  I am also the person he goes to when he has money problems.  Currently he is $250 in debt to me.

Now for the reason why we are fighting.  My roommate was about to move out for the semester and bought a storage container.  He wanted a small container but requested a container too late and had to get a larger container. He allowed our mutual friend to use it with him.
My roommate got 3 keys to the container and I asked for one to put any items he left behind.  I mistakenly thought this included shared items like our microwave. 

He moved all his items into the container and left yesterday.  While leaving he bragged to our mutual friends about not having to do all the cleaning and dishes since he was leaving then.  He had multiple day and even a couple hours to help clean but left it all to me so he wouldn‚Äôt have to.  

I packed all my items into my car and realized that I did not have enough room in my car to take all my items and the shared items.  So before I left I went with another mutual friend to put our shared items in the container with all the items he left behind.  I also left 1 box in the container that was mine.  While I get that part I am the AH for I was planning to either pay my roommate for the box in storage or drive home, unpack, then drive back the next day.  

The friend that helped me move also moved a couple items into the container, I thought he had permission since I had no reason to believe he didn‚Äôt.  

Well we took a video and sent it in our group chat, recreating a video my roommate and I made when moving his items into the storage container.  My roommate saw the video and sent an angry text in the group chat that he never gave us permission to use his storage container and to call him as soon as possible.  I immediately called him and told him about the shared items and the 1 box.  He told me that the shared items were ‚Äúmy items‚Äù.  I said I‚Äôll pay him or move them out but didn‚Äôt have room in my car at the time and couldn‚Äôt keep them in the old apartment.  He also told me that the friend that helped me move stuff didn‚Äôt have permission at all to store stuff.  I apologized and after a bit of arguing I paid him $50 for using the container (he told me $30 but I insisted).  Other than the box I left in the container, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve done anything wrong, but he is still angry with me and saying I‚Äôm the AH.  Neither of us will be back to the container until we move into our new apartment in August so he‚Äôs not planning to store anything else.

126,1cjsahp,AITA Bridesmaid expectations are too much/expensive ,"To make a long story short, my friend asked me to be a bridesmaid and I said yes. The wedding will be in Florida near the end of March (spring break time) and the MOH has not reached out to anyone about budgets for a Bachelorette party. I just got a text and the trip will be in Nashville and the air bnb is like $700 a person and will be a month before the wedding, but they'reasking for half the amount for making a downpayment this weekend. Round trip tickets will more than likely be ~$300, so just traveling and room will be pushing $1000 for just this weekend trip. After eating, drinking and ubering for a long weekend it's probably going to push $1500 in total.

Then the wedding is a month later and round trip tickets for spring break travel near Miami will easily be $400-600 a person. The dresses the MOH is asking us to look at start off at $200, then we're also being expected to use a stylist that they like who charges like another $200 something per person.

Like technically yes I could afford it if we had months to save before making an initial payment, but no budgets were discussed before this bomb was dropped today and I'm honestly kind of mad that I'm being asked to drop $400 in the next day or 2.  I'd almost rather talk to the bride and somehow ask if she'd be alright with me stepping down and just attending as a guest. AITA for thinking this is way too much to ask of a bridesmaid??

127,1cjs77z,AITA for telling my wife I don‚Äôt want our baby boy to go to MIL house anymore?,"I(24) and my wife (24) have been together for almost 7 yrs, throughout our relationship me and her mother(49) never really got along with. 

Now since we have an 7m old baby boy we have my family watching him while we both work, since MIL, wife and I work for the school district. And I work two jobs to make end meets and to help with formula when needed. Which brings to me having working on Saturday mornings which is nothing new to anyone, but a few weeks ago on a Saturday MIL had an appointment to get something removed from the mouth, so my wife went to her house in morning at 6a with our baby boy which is nothing new, to drive her to appointment and help her somewhat once they‚Äôre at her house. Once I got off from my work around 1p my wife told me that she was going to stay a bit longer at her house so that I might as well get rest, I told her that‚Äôs fine since its up to you. While I was at my house I still had my energy drink keeping me awake so I instead started to clean the house instead of resting, which i mentioned to my wife when she FT me to see what I was doing and to see my kid. 

During this call we ended the call by her saying she‚Äôll come home around 5p and me saying whenever you want I don‚Äôt mind either way and that I‚Äôll just be here cleaning till then. Which my wife ended up coming home around 7p and when she got home she told me that she and her mom got into an argument since her mom was yelling at her that she‚Äôs just leaving her there and she was being inconsiderate and that I was rushing her home and that she won‚Äôt watch our kid anymore since apparently that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs good for.

128,1cjs1ja,AITA by accidentally potentially breaking a couple up,"Sooo the other day while out shopping with two friends Yoli and Janice, my friend Yoli told us that she made out with this guy Fred in our fashion design class. I let Yoli know that he had a GF. Two days ago, during a photoshoot I accidentally spilled the tea to my friend Chris...Chris ended up telling me that Fred confided in him about doing something extremely scandalous. I didn't press him for more details. 

Fred started ditching class two days ago so I've become feeling really guilty that I had something to do with it.

Today I sent a text to Fred telling him that I slipped up and talked behind his back about the kiss between him and Yoli.....

After telling Yoli how guilty I felt for telling Chris about it, Yoli tells me that her and Fred didnt actually ""make out"" and that it was actually more of a ""peck"".....

So today I sent Chris a message asking if he had told anyone else about it n thank god Chris said he hadn't.

I also then sent Fred multiple text messages apologizing for potentially starting a false rumour, to which he hasnt replied yet.
 
A couple of hours ago my class partner Rod told me that today is actually Fred's birthday and that he heard Fred tell our professor, Ms. Glum, that he wouldnt be attending the next few classes. 

Now I'm realizing Fred's probably out celebrating with his GF and that she has potentially found out about this whole mess because of my poorly timed apology.

129,1cjrz60,AITA for wanting to do this?,"Background context. I'm currently 29 years old married have a great social cricle etc. There's a guy from our churc (we all met on church) and I felt bad for him and invited him to all our group hangs because he just didn't have friends. This was probably 2 years ago. Over the course of 2 years no one really has become his friend because he still isolates himself and I realized is a very petty person
 He takes advantage of me and my husbamd ALOT and puts us in uncomfortable positions. My husband and Is friend group consists of other couples ajd a couple single guys and girls and we consider eachother family and this guy, lets call him chad just doesn't blend well with any of us. I've been getting frustrated with him taking advantage of us and others and he's becoming very co -dependent of me which i find extremely weird. He's like a clingy girlfriend where (especially when he has issues going on) he will call me nonstop and get very upset when I don't answer the phone. 

One day he proceeded to text me.that je was upset no one else makes an effort to be his friend and i was honest and said he never makes the effort. Evem in our own friendship its always been me inviting him to the group hangs. He got very upset and said im the problem and i dont do enough for him and other things.

I also found out that other people including men have had bad experiences with him and don't wanna be close to him. Am I a jerk if I remove him from the chat? I don't want him in our life anymore and I made this chat as a way to inform everyone of plans as we normally host our friends 99% of the time and the other 1% we go out together. I want to reiterate no one else in the chat considers him a friends and im tired of him still trying to involve himself with us.

Unbeknownst to me, my friend Ashley messaged Carly and told her her husband Eric was rude to me and that they both should respect my time and my condition and not put more on me than needed or cause unnecessary drama since I‚Äôm sickly. 
Then next morning I sent Carly Happy Birthday wishes posts  and texts. She didn‚Äôt respond. Later I received a long text from her.  The text reads as follows: ‚ÄúLook since you want to send Ashley over to me gone head and stay home  next weekend because I really was about to say some shit to here but I ain‚Äôt even got the energy.‚Äù I replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go after what your husband said to me.‚Äù She responded: ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs cool then.‚Äù Carly then blocked me on everything. 
Eric messaged me after she blocked me saying: Congratulations you played yourself. Carly and I had been friends since middle school, her husband he didn‚Äôt like our friendship, but I never knew he hated me just for existing.  So Am I the A$$hole? ",0.0,0.01658608391880989,0,1
