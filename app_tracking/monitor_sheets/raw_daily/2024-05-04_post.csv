0,1ck3m7p,AITA for refusing to let my sister and her friends stay over at my house because they were rude to me?,"context m28 lives alone in an apartment with 3 bedrooms. Last year I let my f22 sister and her friends stay over as they needed accommodation for a night as they are attending a concert in my city. 

&#x200B;

They didn't mess anything up in my apartment. 

&#x200B;

However my apartment walls are thin I can hear everything in the room they are staying in especially their gossips and my sister's friends had horrible things to say about me like ""you're brother is so ugly, cant believe you got all the good genes"" or ""he looks autistic and a socially awkward inccel"" (Because I'm lanky and wear glasses - still working on it üòÇüòÇ). Also making fun of my OCD and tics. 

&#x200B;

My sister barely defended me saying ""shhh he's giving us a free stay"".

&#x200B;

But yeah sticks and stones but considering I'm giving them a place free to stay for a night it kinda rubs me the wrong way. But I didn't kick them out and let them stay the whole night.

&#x200B;

Additionally I picked all of them up from the airport and dropped them off and none of them were even appreciative for me driving them or letting them stay over. Not even a thank you, like even a 'thank you' would make me turn a blind eye to the gossiping.

&#x200B;

Now this year the similar concert is happening, but I refused to let them stay over. And this bugged my sister off a lot with her calling me a petty inccel over small issues.

&#x200B;

Am i the petty asshole in this?

1,1cjr3t2,AITA for calling the cops on my ex‚Äôs donor conceived daughter?,"Around early March I received an email asking for details about my ex, which I thought as a front to advanced credit card scams and ignored. Then I got more emails with more details about the girl‚Äôs situation and I forwarded them to my ex, telling him to deal with her. 

However, over time she has found my work phone and called me there, which isn‚Äôt hard to find but definitely stalker behavior. She called me three times before I had her number blocked. I did talk to her on the phone the first time and told her not to contact me, that I do not want her in my kids‚Äô lives. 

My wasband says it was an anonymous donation he made in uni for money and I believe him. We are not divorced but on and off and he is still a very much a part of my life (and his real children‚Äôs.) She has tried to contact him before me and he told her stop initiating contact, he would‚Äôve picked known donor but he wanted to be anonymous. 

We also looked her up in various ways and we do not want to associate with her any further. I thought she was reasonable at first but I do not think she is right in the head anymore. 

The last straw was a week ago when she showed up to my place. Luckily my kids were in day care and the only people at home were me and my ex who was visiting. He recognizes her and goes out to tell her to leave, but she starts screaming and crying and it was a proper mess so he comes back inside. She knocks on the door but I had locked it and I tell her leave or ill call the police. Please leave.  Etc 

Let‚Äôs just say she lives very far away. She had no innocent reason to be there.  It was very concerning to see her car there and then her insane behavior when approached. 

Now she is trying to ‚Äòexpose‚Äô us on her public instagram account. She does not have followers, but she did include my full name and work address which I reported to instagram and the station nearby who sent the cops i called on her.

9,1cjqaxt,AITA for rejecting my BFs new birthday plans after the old plans were cancelled?,"A month back, my BF(25M) purchased tickets to see a ballet that wasn‚Äôt originally intended to be for my(22F) birthday but we both agreed we‚Äôd go together as a birthday event since it would fall near the date, under the condition I pay back for at least half of my ticket price. We also agreed to go to karaoke with some friends. 

The friends ended up cancelling the karaoke. It later turned out that I also needed to undergo a tooth procedure only two days before the ballet. The dentist told me my face would be swelling for a few days and advised I stay home, so I told my boyfriend I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. He was pretty sad about the cancellation, but managed to convince his mother to come instead. 

Well, it turns out I had almost no side effects after the procedure, and would be in a perfectly fine state to go to the ballet. But when I brought up how perfectly fine I felt, my BF admitted he would‚Äôve loved to bring me but it was too late now because his mother was excited for the ballet, and changing his mind on her would be discouraging. Fair enough. I left it alone at the time.

The day before the ballet, he was showing me his texts with his mom about their conversations about the event and I noticed that she had said if I feel fine, my BF should let her know if I would like to take back my ticket. At this point it felt fair for me to get my ticket back, but I didn‚Äôt want to push it, so I just said ‚Äúit would be pretty nice if I could still go but I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel bad about it‚Äù. He continued to insist that it was too late because it would disappoint her.

So the morning of the ballet, I asked if there could be some sort of compromise for me missing out on the ballet as that was the only remaining thing we had planned for my bday. I‚Äôll admit I was a bit upset considering for Christmas and Valentine‚Äôs day we didn‚Äôt really do much, and I never received a gift when I had gotten one for him.

He immediately got angry saying it wasn‚Äôt his fault I couldn‚Äôt go and that it seemed like I was attacking him for not taking me to the ballet, which was not my intention at all. We then got into an argument about how it didn‚Äôt seem like he was that invested in our plans for my birthday at this point. It just felt disappointing considering he‚Äôs so willing to come up with plans with other people (albeit he doesn‚Äôt see them nearly as often as we see each other) but it has to feel like a chore to come up with things to do together. 

He later gave in and found a show we could go to after I hinted at it, but to me it feels like he only did that out of pressure. I have a feeling if I never brought it up, we would‚Äôve ended up doing nothing. He tells me he‚Äôs disappointed too and wants my birthday to be special, but it seems like this guilty expression was only because I had a reaction to it considering his nonchalance about it before.

A month back, my BF(25M) purchased tickets to see a ballet that wasn‚Äôt originally intended to be for my(22F) birthday but we both agreed we‚Äôd go together as a birthday event since it would fall near the date, under the condition I pay back for at least half of my ticket price. We also agreed to go to karaoke with some friends. 

The friends ended up cancelling the karaoke. It later turned out that I also needed to undergo a tooth procedure only two days before the ballet. The dentist told me my face would be swelling for a few days and advised I stay home, so I told my boyfriend I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. He was pretty sad about the cancellation, but managed to convince his mother to come instead. 

Well, it turns out I had almost no side effects after the procedure, and would be in a perfectly fine state to go to the ballet. But when I brought up how perfectly fine I felt, my BF admitted he would‚Äôve loved to bring me but it was too late now because his mother was excited for the ballet, and changing his mind on her would be discouraging. Fair enough. I left it alone at the time.

The day before the ballet, he was showing me his texts with his mom about their conversations about the event and I noticed that she had said if I feel fine, my BF should let her know if I would like to take back my ticket. At this point it felt fair for me to get my ticket back, but I didn‚Äôt want to push it, so I just said ‚Äúit would be pretty nice if I could still go but I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel bad about it‚Äù. He continued to insist that it was too late because it would disappoint her.

I told her no because for one thing, I don't wanna leave split one kid up with the other, and I feel uneasy when my kids aren't in my sight. mom things idk. 

  
Even though it was over the phone, based on her tone alone, I could tell she was slightly annoyed by my answer. She hung up after without saying much. Later, her husband texts me (or her using her husbands phone) and asks me again to reconsider. My sister is 5'7 and 145 pounds, so i dont understand the issue.

20,1cjomhq,AITA for continuing to vocally stim even if it annoys my friend?,"Hi everyone,

I have a vocal stim that involves making repetitive noises, especially in stressful or uncomfortable situations. It‚Äôs part of how I cope due to my neurodiversity. Recently, my friends told me that they find this stim really annoying, and one even asked me to stop doing it around them.

I understand that it can be distracting, but it‚Äôs not something I can easily control, and it helps me manage my autism. I've tried to explain this to my friends, but they seem to think I can just stop if I try harder. This has made me feel unwelcome in my own friend group.

22,1cjnpwf,AITA for saying I won't sleep in the bed if my child sleeps in it too?,"My wife and I have two kids (4M, 1F) and sleep can be pretty hard to come by in general with two young kids. But it's a bit harder for me because I have bipolar disorder and insomnia that's really connected to my mood - if I don't sleep, I tend to have a major mood shift. Also, I have arthritis so have pretty achy joints and feel pretty run down a lot. 

I've basically been sleeping in the guest room for the last 9 months. At first it was because my wife wanted to co-sleep with our baby and I didn't feel comfortable sharing a bed with them because I take meds to help my insomnia that make me a deep sleeper and I was afraid it wouldn't be safe for all of us. Our daughter's been out of our bed for a few months now but as soon as she left, our 4 year old started sleeping in there. And even though it's not about safety with him in there, with my insomnia and difficulties falling asleep, unless I am relaxed in the environment it is so hard to sleep and it's hard to relax with a starfished out 4 year old. 

So I just have essentially moved to the guest room to sleep otherwise I feel that I won't be able to sleep and that can trigger a mood episode or make my joints feel crummy. My wife says I'm being a big baby and am using this an excuse not to be near her and I need to suck it up. She also said that she has no problem with our son sleeping in our bed even though I've explained that means I can't sleep in there. In her defense, she now only lets him sleep in there a couple of nights a week but it's super hard to bounce back and forth for me. 

I feel bad making it an ultimatum of ""me or our kid"" but ultimately, I feel like my sleep is too important to miss out on and it sucks for our relationship and intimacy for me to be in another room, but I feel like an achy and irritable dad is even worse.
