0,1cl1qyl,AITA for not wanting to attend my sister's wedding?,"For context, I'm (25) an autistic ambulatory wheelchair user. I am underweight but am making small progress on my health. I also have severe anxiety about leaving home, especially staying overnight elsewhere. I also got my name legally changed years ago, and I identify as nonbinary. My family never uses my pronouns but some have accepted my new legal name. They’re also not happy about me owning a wheelchair. Even then, this wheelchair isn’t perfect, as I had to compromise with my dad to fit his “needs” over mine, and at times, I feel unsafe in it.

Regarding the wedding: my sister said ""I don't want you down the aisle in a wheelchair on my wedding day."" Any explanations of my needs were shot down promptly. Discussing dress, she wanted me in a dress. I wanted a suit, but coordinated with the bridesmaids. She still wanted me to try the dress she wanted for me. I gave it a try but immediately wanted to burst into tears, as you could see how thin I am without a second glance. It smashed every bit of confidence and self-esteem in me, seeing my exposed bony body like that. I held back tears, as she further berated me for my dyed hair, not wanting me to show up with ginger locks. 

She’s booked hotels, asking if I wanted to stay the night before the wedding or to grab a train to return home early, but I would have to wake up at 5am to grab the train, *without my wheelchair, alone*. On foot, I’m also in danger of overexerting/fainting. My family wouldn’t be able to transport me back (since they’re all staying at the hotel), and spending money on a taxi would cost me £70+ *one way*. I don't have that kind of money.

Arriving at my sister's pre-wedding party, I could read her lips saying ""oh god"" as she saw my wheelchair. Inside, my sister greets the family and asks why I brought my chair, as I explained to her that I would be in pain if I walked. She fires back by saying I am “embarrassing her” by using it. I folded, putting it away and using my walking stick. Later on, my sister introduced me to her friends and fiancée, but not my legal name, not my dead name, but with ""this is my sister, Chick."" I immediately butt in, explaining it’s my family nickname. Her friends get confused, thinking “chick” is my actual name, and I find out that she never used my legal name with her friends at all. She still refers to me as her sister, and refuses to use my legal name. 

At this point, I don’t even want to go to her wedding, when she disrespects me this way. I feel like I’m being told that I’m a sore sight for my own disabilities and how I present myself. I understand this is her special wedding, and I’m trying to meet in the middle with her, but I don’t feel like she’s compromising with me *at all*. I’ve done all I can to meet what she wants out of me up to this point, even if I don’t want to.

1,1cl0x25,AITA for wanting more space from my parents (UPDATE) ,"Hello people of Reddit:

If any of you are interested. A year ago, I posted on Reddit asking for advice about my parents (M55 and F54) wanting me (M27) to move back to our home town. 

Well.. a lot has happened in the past year.  I wanted to say thank you for anyone that commented on my last post.  All of the advice was welcomed and greatly appreciated. 

Around Thanksgiving of 2023 was when I sat both of my parents down to discuss my future plans.  I told them that it was my life to live and if I didn’t want to move back, then I didn’t have to move back.  Nothing was changing.  They weren’t going to lose me as their son as I still care for them, love and adore them.  

This was sort of a reality check for BOTH of my parents.  They apologized for being so controlling of that aspect of my life.  My mom even started to cry.  They told me that it was difficult to see me move out after being so involved with their lives over the past 26 years.  At the end of this discussion, we hugged it out and nothing negative has come out of this, which was what I was afraid of in the first place. 

I still love my job, I still love my friends, and I’m still with my GF (2 years in August) whom I am going to happily going to “pop the question” to this Fall!

Cheers everyone!  I know some of y’all want “spicy” updates when it comes to these stories, but that just won’t do lol 😂.",UPDATE,2024-05-05,"AITA for wanting more space from my parents (UPDATE)  Hello people of Reddit:

2,1ckq7o9,AITA for not telling my family my trans cousin was coming to my wedding?,"So this June, I (29F) and my fiance (29M) are getting married in the Catholic Church. My family is highly conservative, and whereas I’m moving along fine with the changes in our society, the rest of the family still remains conservative.  

Now this family member that I invited is biologically my 3rd cousin on my mothers fathers side. My grandparents adopted my “younger uncle “ when they were 3 and I was 5. I helped with teaching them to talk and we were raised almost like siblings!

As we grew older, my grandparents moved to a different city, they weren’t overly far, but it still took us 45 minutes- 1hour to drive there. So visits got shorter and less frequent. They were in middle school, so they started getting involved in other crowds, meeting new people. I still have concerns that all of this was taught, because this is a person that feeds on attention. When someone isn’t fully there it really is hard to figure out what’s real and what’s true. But regardless, they came out of the closet to me, first about being gay at 13years old. I thought it was a phase especially with an incident with one of my ex boyfriends. But still that shouldn’t “make someone gay” or whatever. As time went on, gay turned into bi, bi turned into trans, then for a short term it was trans and liked girls so “lesbian?”, and now they’re settling down to trans male to female and likes male. 

Through all the chaos and confusion, I loved them regardless. But my grandparents/ their adoptive parents, couldn’t accept them as they were, so “she” moved away to another state to start a new life in 2019. Ironically I just found out I was pregnant with my son when she moved. She missed all of the big milestones with him… 

Anyway, back to present time, we’re getting married in a month. And word got out that they’re coming. Another cousin that they talk to said something to her grandma (my aunt) and now all four sisters know. I was hoping that if no one else knew that it would slip under the radar as no one would be looking and pinpointing them out. The agreement was that her and her boyfriend would stay close to other friends and she wouldn’t mingle with the family. And we were both perfectly fine with that. But now word is out and I’m fighting with my mom and her sisters over it and I really didn’t want it to be a big deal. 
Now that the focus is geared on that I’m now concerned that it’s taking away the celebrations of our special day and us starting a life together.

4,1ckieqt,AITA for being upset I didn’t get invited to my childhood best friend’s wedding,"AITA for being upset I didn’t get invited to my childhood best friend’s wedding?

So my childhood best friend moved a few hours away back in 4th grade, we’re 22 now. We have stayed in touch all these years and still see each other once or twice a year. Well, she got engaged last year. I called her and we screamed on the phone and were so excited. When I started dating my current boyfriend about 4 years ago, I drove him to her city to meet her. She was an important person in my life and I wanted him to meet her. This girl and I have been friends for 15 years. She means the world to me. 
So, it never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t be invited to her wedding. She has a very wealthy family and they know a lot of people. She also has a ton of friends, she’s always been popular and makes friends everywhere she goes. So I know this will be a huge wedding.

Well, I didn’t get asked to be a bridesmaid. I didn’t take it personally, I knew she just had so many friends and I didn’t know any of them really despite meeting a few times. 
And then, her bridal shower pictures got posted. I hadn’t been invited to that either. But I again didn’t take it personally and figured maybe she just didn’t think I’d make the drive to be there. 
And then, I didn’t get invited to her wedding. It’s next month and I’ve yet to recieve an invite. Her and I chatted on the phone 2 months ago, 3 months ago, around Christmas. Our normal monthly check ins. Everything has been normal and fine. Well, she didn’t text me happy birthday in March. And then I texted her in April, no response. And now her wedding is next month and I didn’t get an invite. 
I know what venue she will have it at, because obviously I know her well. This venue is massive. I know her parents are multimillionaires at this point, so it’s going to be big. 

But I didn’t ever think I wouldn’t be invited. I thought there was a chance she’d ask me to be IN the wedding. I had planned on her being a bridesmaid in my wedding. And to not even be invited? 

I feel really hurt and confused. There was no falling out, no negativity, no reason I can think of that would make her not want me around. 

Am I crazy? Does this mean she doesn’t want my friendship anymore? Did she just forget about me? Should I even say anything or just let our friendship fizzle out since it seems that’s what she wants? 

I’m so hurt. The thought of not calling her my friend and never meeting each other’s future children is heartbreaking to me.

7,1cki7ph,"AITA for telling my brother I am not happy that he ""found love""?","  
Throwaway since I don’t know who in my life has Reddit.

I (18F) was not bullied in high school, but I was an overweight, shy, art kid- meaning it was a funny joke to ask me out on fake dates and laugh while I presented speeches in class. 

After an incident at junior prom where I and another girl wore the same off-the-rack dress, she was really aggressive to me. She was also into art, and in our classes together would say downright cruel things about me and my work during critiques (so bad that my art teacher stopped doing them). It did a number on my self-esteem and my pride as an artist and in a way impacted me furthering my art education. 

This weekend my brothers and I were all home from school, and my oldest brother (21M), told us he wanted us to meet his new girlfriend. For context, my brother broke up with a longtime girlfriend of his last year and only recently started coming out of the slump that left him in, so we were thrilled to meet this new girl. I was excited too, because despite the contents of this story I do love my brother.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-05,"AITA for telling my brother I am not happy that he ""found love""?   
Throwaway since I don’t know who in my life has Reddit.

I (18F) was not bullied in high school, but I was an overweight, shy, art kid- meaning it was a funny joke to ask me out on fake dates and laugh while I presented speeches in class. 

After an incident at junior prom where I and another girl wore the same off-the-rack dress, she was really aggressive to me. She was also into art, and in our classes together would say downright cruel things about me and my work during critiques (so bad that my art teacher stopped doing them). It did a number on my self-esteem and my pride as an artist and in a way impacted me furthering my art education. 

This weekend my brothers and I were all home from school, and my oldest brother (21M), told us he wanted us to meet his new girlfriend. For context, my brother broke up with a longtime girlfriend of his last year and only recently started coming out of the slump that left him in, so we were thrilled to meet this new girl. I was excited too, because despite the contents of this story I do love my brother.

 Except that this new girl was the girl from high school who also conveniently went to that college. Admittedly I got very emotional here. I started crying and shut myself in my room for the rest of the night, and later my brother came to talk to me after she had left.

8,1cki28f,AITA for telling my old roommate (20) that I (21) dont want to hear her self righteous bs?,"So I (21) moved back in September. I found a roommate online, L (21), and we needed to get another roommate. L suggested their old friend S (F20). 

Things got bad after S moved in: she stopped speaking to us after it was mentioned we were autistic, spent at most one night a week living with us (rest with her mum), refused to do any cleaning, was unhygienically messy, extremely rude, ext.

It felt like she was using our home as an AirBnB, and us as ""mum fairies"".

Yes we asked her on many occasions to clean. All we got was ""your cleanliness standards are too high"".

FINALLY she sent us a text saying she was moving out, and to find someone else.

We found C (26), who would mesh perfectly with our personalities and cleanliness (basic hygiene.)  C had to move from their current place as the landlord had suddenly told them the house was being sold, and they had until the end of april to be gone.

We told S on April 4th as soon as we found C. S collected her things but left the mattress. The mess she left was disgusting and I knew we had to thoroughly clean it before C moved in.

We asked when she would come collect the mattress her only response was ""when is C moving in?"", we explained the situation with the current place and told her preferably April 20th. Her only response was ""well I paid for this month, so its my room"".

Under normal circumstances this would be entirely understandable, but she wasnt even living there, and was at her mums, C on the other hand had nowhere to temporarily put their stuff. We told her again, asked her to look at her calendar and let us know when shes free to pick it up.

She got mad at us, about how she owned the room. I told her that because she was breaking the lease by leaving five months into the 18 month agreement, she was responsible for making sure everything was out in time for the new person, and that all we needed was a date. her response was to get extremely mad that I said she ""broke lease"", telling me she owned that room, we had no right to demand anything of her, and she would take it whenever she wants. she explained how she was so kind about everything she had done, like pay for the rent until we found someone (something she legally had to do), and how we were being mean.

I sent her a reply that said ""I dont want to hear anymore self righteous bullshit. I will not be communicating with you unless it is about the date you will be collecting the mattress. we need the mattress gone before end of the month, so that I can properly clean it, as it is unfit for someone to move into in it's current state of dead insects, spoiled food and evidence of rodents. just give us a date, S""

Some people have been saying I was too harsh, as the state of her room indicates mental health issues. I'm not to sures, though, and if she does it does not excuse anything. I might have been a bit blunt, but I was at my wits end, in near tears with frustration with this girl.

12,1ckhbjm,WIBTA if I told my wealthy FIL the schemes his other son is doing? ,"I (31 F) am engaged to my partner (40 M) and we welcomed our LO a few months an ago. My partner is very financially stable and has a well-paying career. I have a great job too and I’m going to school. 

So my fiancée and his brother (38 M) who I will call Bob went to school together for the same career, however Bob chose to go back to bartending while my fiancee stayed in the field. 

My fiancée and his brother have a very wealthy father. Their father bought them the houses they live in now and gave a trust fund at 35, giving them a head start for stability but they had to keep it going themselves. 
No more handouts after that. 

My fiancée used that trust fund for his mortgage. His brother Bob used his trust fund to not work for a few years. 

Then I came into the picture. And we got engaged after 2 years. 
Bobs gf became pretty threatened by this because Bob won’t marry her. And because he won’t marry her, she will not be getting any inheritance money from any family members. Mainly their father. (Crazy story here.)
 
Feeling threatened, the gf announces they are expecting … again. #4. 

Any penny they had left is completely gone now. 

Feeling desperate, Bob asks my fiancée if he can use his identity to find a good job under his name. He wants his resume, ID, social, etc., to get a well paying job in the same field. My partner tells him no. But Bob keeps pestering and pestering saying they are struggling.

then he asks my fiancée to borrow $20,000 while I am in the hospital. My fiancée says we don’t have that kind of money but it’ll be no even if we did. 

Then Last week Bob said he had no money for the mortgage this month and he could lose the house. He begged my fiancee. My fiancée felt so bad for him so asked for help fixing the roof for money. 

Yesterday, Bob showed up for 1 HOUR “to help” and then ran off because his gf wanted him to do the dishes. My fiancee still paid him in full.

Today Bob is asking for money and his identity again.

I told my fiancée his brother and his gf are spoiled freeloaders. I grew up with a single mom, living check to check. If we didn’t work, we didn’t eat. I still have that mindset. To have his brother coming in asking for savings that I’m also contributing to is infuriating.

I told my fiancée that I’d like to talk to his dad this week. 
You see… it is their dad’s name on Bobs house. I want to know what exactly is going on here. Shouldn’t their wealthy father help him out? 
But my fiancée says I’d be inviting drama and it’s an AH move.

Bob has adamantly refused cus he loves his house. Instead he’s asking people to pay his mortgage so his dad doesn’t find out and sells the house. 

The house issue: FIL paid for half the house in cash and mortgaged the other half for his sons so they could pay less monthly as he still wanted them to be responsible and work. 
He got them houses but did not fully pay it off so his name had been on both homes.

14,1ckh7f6,AITA for freaking out at my girlfriend after she made kissy faces to her male friends?,"I (M22) have been dating May (F22) for 2 years. She moved to the US when she was 13 and grew up in a very different culture. She didn't really make any friends while in the U.S.

May has a group of childhood friends⁰ (male and female) from her home country that moved to the US as international students.

For the first time, I finally met these people and we were hanging out with my friends as well at a Karaoke place.

May would joke around with her friends and get really physical, like hugging her friends from behind, putting an arm around their shoulders, touching each other's faces and etc. She's like this to only her friends.

During moments at the Karaoke, they would sing love songs to each other and have this drama like act. I admit, it was funny at first, but then they would flirt with each other and laugh it off.

One moment, i saw she was talking to one of her guy friends and she randomly gave him a wink and blew him a kiss. The dude gagged and they started laughing obnoxiously.

On our drive back home, I told her how her actions were completely inappropriate.

She said that's how they normally hangout and have fun by being touchy and ""affectionate"". And added that she understands I may have felt uncomfortable.

I told her I felt disrespected by how she acted.

She countered that some of her friends are dating each and everyone understands there's no romantic interest.

I didn't talk to her for the rest of the night and she just said ""okay,"" and had one of her friends pick her up.

16,1ckgyku,AITA for cutting my dead father sister off?,"My (F17) aunt (F36) had always disliked my mom(F38) ever since my dad has gotten with her. Before i was born, my mom and my aunt has always been at each others throat. The only reason they kept it somewhat civil is because my dad was the bridge between them two. My mom has always been patient, but my aunt has always been the one to make my mom loose that patience. 

Back in 2019, my dad passed away from a heart attack, and my mom thought it was finally time to make amends with my aunt, since that was always my dad’s wish. My mom called my aunt to tell her the news and she drove 2 hours, along with my grandma to see my dad one last time. Since it took her long, my mom decided to take him off of life support, to stop the suffering. My aunt made a fit, saying that she shouldn’t have made that decision, since my mother wasn’t his wife.

A few words were exchanged between those two and my grandma had to break it up. My mom was 5 months pregnant at that time, so the stress was really getting to her, so she decided to let that go. One evening my aunt asked my mom who was still pregnant to drive 2 hours so she can see me. My mom agreed and all was well, until my mom gave birth.

My sisters came out lighter than light and their skin barely had any melanin in it. Little back story, my mom and my dad has been trying really hard to kids, but wasn’t successful for many years. They finally decided to get a doner. Thats what my Grandma and my aunt don’t know. My aunt made a huge fit and my mom let her because she gets where shes coming from. The reason my mom wont tell them is because she’s afraid they wont believe her and bash her on the internet for being a “cheating wh*re” as what my aunt is calling her now.

 Fast forward to a week ago, my grandma was supposed to come over to see us as she hasn’t for the longest time. She called us and said shed had to cancel due to doctor appointments, which we totally got, since shes a cancer survivor. But one day my grandma called us saying that my aunt doesn’t care for her and that my mom is the only one that does, mind you my mom is not my grandma’s daughter, my aunt is. Then she tells how my aunt forced her not to come and told her to cut every one of us off. mind you, we all haven’t talked or even been in each other’s sight since 2021. 

My aunt tries to contact me here and there, and since shes my dad sister, i try so hard to satisfy her with responses, but what she has caused my mom mental pain, and my grandma mental aswell, i told her that i wont talk to her anymore because shes a messed up person, and deserves nothing but karma. She has ruined my relationship with my cousin & grandma. She had runied my mom’s mentality, and she had ruined herself even seeing me ever again.

18,1ckgl74,AITA for telling off my sister’s BF?,"   Am I the asshole for telling off my sister’s boyfriend? 
I have never really liked my sisters boyfriend, they have had a complicated and messy relationship the entire time and is very two faced. For reference I started hating him when I (17F) stayed with my sister(26F) for a week at her friend’s  house to dog sit last year.

  They started dating shortly after they both had failed engagements to other people, they had moved fairly quickly and my sister moved in with him about two weeks into their relationship. Around the four month mark or so he got her a dog as a way for her to stay with him since they were in a rough spot. 
During the winter I stayed with my sister at her friends house to help her dog sit. At the end of the week we had made plans to meet up with my dad at a Boston Pizza in the small town near the small town where I live. “Steve”(26M) lives in the small town where we were going to meet my dad and wanted to join us. At first I wasn’t against it till he had called my sister and started yelling at her through the phone while we were driving. He was pissed off that she didn’t originally invite him to come with, and about some plans she had made with her friends and her father(we have separate dads.) 
He was yelling at her and even started “intimidating” her at one point. I felt as though he was out of line and took the phone and yelled at “Steve”. I had asked him why he thought he could talk to my sister that way, and he started yelling at me and “intimidating” me as well calling me “A spoiled little rat.”

Usually I am a peaceful person, and often don’t resort to aggression but by this point “Steve” pissed me off since I have always worked for what I have and have had a job since I was 15, and raised myself due to absent parents. I had told him not to ever talk to my sister like that or me, and threatened him back and hung up. He called again and she was crying not understanding why he was mad or why he had said those things, so I answered it, told him we will text him when we got there and not to call her. 

BUT WAIT THERES MORE!! They broke up and were FWB and he cut her off completely to date another girl. Then he and the girl broke up and my sister and him got together AGAIN! They would lie about the hook ups when she was living with me and my dad, and sometimes she would come home with hickies and other marks. They are still dating, my brothers and I all dislike him. My older brother “Chad” just had his 20th birthday and nf my sister brought “Steve”. 
My brother was not happy and even said “I hope “Steve” is tolerable tonight or I’m going off”. When they showed up a few hours went by before my sisters BF started picking fights. 
He was saying things to me like “I hope you don’t turn out like your mom she is insane” and was ranting to me about something my sister said that annoyed him, when it was directed at our brother. I told him it didn’t matter since she wasn’t talking to him, and he had no right to make a comment about my mom like that since he isn’t part of my family and doesn’t understand what we went through as kids. He proceeded to raise his voice at me and told me not to talk back to him since he could be my brother in law one day. I stood up and told him to go fuck himself and get out since he wasn’t welcome to the party in the first place. My brother “Chad” agreed and some of his football buddies and our oldest brother walked “Steve” out. 

I feel like I may have had a part in the fights and my sister is upset with me about both situations, and has even called me an asshole over it. But my family is torn about who is actually in the wrong.

Today, I went to a gas station to grab my nephew a gift card for his birthday. It was an hour and a half drive with 3 small kids to where the party was. A line had formed because there was some issue at one of the cash registers so I got in the back of it. Two people proceeded to get in line on the opposite sides of the man in front of me. When he finally got up to the cash register, one of the women declared ""I was here first, she'll go next, and then you can go."" . I was a little bit frustrated that she hadn't asked me if I had been in line and then proceeded to tell her ""Actually, I had been here first and have been waiting in line a very long time. I am going to go to the register first."". She then got really rude and said ""No you were not, I was here."" To which I replied very firmly ""Actually no, I was here and watched you get in line after me. I followed the direction of the original line that had formed. If you have an issue with it you are welcome to ask the cashier who was here first, but I will be going up next"". At this point, I had already been in line for like 15 whole minutes waiting, it was hot, and though I usually wouldn't mind, I was tired from my ride and knew my husband was in the car with three cranky kids. She then said ""Who are you? You're like half my fucking age. Lines don't matter and you shouldn't bring the cashier into this."" My blood pressure was through the roof after her statement and general rudeness so I replied ""Age has nothing to do with it. General decency and respect does.""

She then said ""It's not that big of a deal. I'm not sure why you're making such a big deal of this."" As if she hadn't acted entitled and argued with me.

I generally avoid altercations. I don't like arguing, but I was sort of at my last straw. When I got up to the cash register I apologized and said I just didn't appreciate how she had assumed she was there first and had offered other people to go before me despite me waiting there well before her. I paid for the card and walked out.
She had a point though, it wasn't a huge deal, but I also think that if she had the social etiquette to have asked me if I was there, I still would have said yes... Because I was, and I was tired. Beyond that, her entitled nature and rude remarks were not needed. She didn't have any disabilities that would make waiting hard for her, and despite being older she was probably only in her mid to late 50s. Yet, I find myself wondering if I should have just turned the other cheek or handled the situation better.

Today, I went to a gas station to grab my nephew a gift card for his birthday. It was an hour and a half drive with 3 small kids to where the party was. A line had formed because there was some issue at one of the cash registers so I got in the back of it. Two people proceeded to get in line on the opposite sides of the man in front of me. When he finally got up to the cash register, one of the women declared ""I was here first, she'll go next, and then you can go."" . I was a little bit frustrated that she hadn't asked me if I had been in line and then proceeded to tell her ""Actually, I had been here first and have been waiting in line a very long time. I am going to go to the register first."". She then got really rude and said ""No you were not, I was here."" To which I replied very firmly ""Actually no, I was here and watched you get in line after me. I followed the direction of the original line that had formed. If you have an issue with it you are welcome to ask the cashier who was here first, but I will be going up next"". At this point, I had already been in line for like 15 whole minutes waiting, it was hot, and though I usually wouldn't mind, I was tired from my ride and knew my husband was in the car with three cranky kids. She then said ""Who are you? You're like half my fucking age. Lines don't matter and you shouldn't bring the cashier into this."" My blood pressure was through the roof after her statement and general rudeness so I replied ""Age has nothing to do with it. General decency and respect does."" She retorted again ""You're half my age, go up then and don't fucking talk to me."" I couldn't help myself, looked at her and said ""I have never met anybody so arrogant or rude."" She then said ""It's not that big of a deal. I'm not sure why you're making such a big deal of this."" As if she hadn't acted entitled and argued with me.

23,1ckfmro,AITA for not inviting my best friend’s mom to her surprise cancer free party? ,"
**Disclosure I got permission from my best friend to post this. 

Bear with me as this has quite some background. 
My best friend Molly (female 26) and I have grown up together. She’s like my sister. We grew up in a very religious (organized religion semi-cult like) atmosphere and went to a religious school.  After we both graduated high school, we were able to kind of leave that environment and  discover ourselves and have our own opinions and mindsets separate from the church.  It took a couple of years post high school to figure it out though. When Molly was 19, she ended up marrying her brother’s best friend, Carl, as her family “shipped” them, so she leaned into it based on social pressure.  They moved away for a few years due to Carl’s job.   Then moved back home about four years ago.  When they came back, Molly sent me this really long message telling me she and Carl were getting a divorce because she’s gay.  She finally had time to find herself while away and had been afraid to tell her family and friends because it kinda turns her life upside down.  She was worried about rejection.  I told her that I loved her and I’ll be there to support her no matter what and she’ll always be my best friend and I was proud of her for being brave and true to herself.  She came out to each of her siblings and her dad, all very supportive. When she came out to her mom and her stepdad, they weren’t as supportive. In fact her stepdad Gary even went to the extent of saying “if she’s coming over, I’m going to take my daughter (Mollys younger step sister Chelsea) and leave because I can’t be around her.” Which is some crazy homophobic shit and also exactly what she was terrified of.  But luckily, despite the lack of understanding and support from her mom and stepdad, she’s been able to grow more comfortable and stand up for herself.  Even setting healthy boundaries to avoid the homophobic and nonsupportive family members.  Because of this, Molly also had a strained relationship with her mother, who claimed that Gary isn’t homophobic he just doesn’t know her that well and doesn’t feel comfortable having his daughter Chelsea alone with Molly.  Which is bullshit because he’s known her for the past 10 years and Molly has spent lots of time with Chelsea before but all of a sudden now that Molly’s gay, he “doesn’t know her that well”.  Over the last few years Molly‘s been invited to her mom‘s house for events like birthdays or holidays and Molly has declined ever since Gary’s stance on Molly being over.  Molly’s mom is also a very controlling, negative, and self centered person.  So she doesn’t understand the boundaries Molly has made to respect herself.  For example, when Molly didn’t come over to her mom’s house for her mom’s birthday party, but instead said Happy birthday in a text and offered to go to lunch with her another day, Molly’s mom would get pissed and blog about it, and say how selfish children can ruin birthdays, but it’s okay Jesus was a martyr too.  Basically her blog is her an open diary but she tries to disguise it as a religious blog with passive aggressive stories (usually about her children) and slaps on a bible verse at the end to wrap it all together.  Obviously you can see why Molly had a strained relationship with her mom.  

Over the last two years Molly has been feeling like shit and going to multiple doctors to try and find the source of her health issues, after 18 months, she was finally diagnosed with stage 3 cancer.  After the diagnosis, everyone was devastated and sad, but we jumped in to support.  Molly’s partner, Taylor, and I would take turns taking her to chemo and doctors appointments.  Her siblings and dad all visited her and spent more time with her.  Through the course of treatments, she felt like shit, constant bone pain, weakness, nausea, etc.  Then her last pet scan revealed she was in remission and all she had to do was finish her chemo treatments up.  We couldn’t be happier with the news.  All Molly could talk about was finally feeling better and normal and celebrating.  So Taylor and I planned a small surprise party.  Inviting Mollys dad, her siblings, a couple of friends.  We even invited Mollys step sister Chelsea, however we did not invite Mollys mom or stepdad.  Mollys mom was upset she was not invited, and started to complain to Mollys siblings, saying “Why am I not invited, of course you leave me out, I’m the worse and you hate me”.  She was making it about her.  And then she said, “Chelsea is not allowed to go unless I am,” even though we’re pretty sure Gary already said Chelsea couldn’t go.  But Here’s the thing, or multiple things, 1.) What would Molly do? She wouldn’t invite her mom, for many reasons, partially because of the lack of connection and respect, and the boundaries she has set. 2.) Molly has never introduced her partner Taylor to her mom (again going back to the respect and boundaries thing, protecting Taylor).  We are not going to take away the choice and decision of how Mollys mom meets her partner for the first time, that should be up to Molly.  3.) Mollys mom would be uncomfortable with everything if she did come.  Again her mom is very religious and conservative.  And the essential theme of the party was fuck cancer.  We were also having it at Molly and Taylor’s house, which has pictures and art of naked women, a succulent plant holder that’s the shape of tits, and they have other “adult” decor like fridge magnets that say fuck, cunt, twat.  She would feel the environment is offensive, disrespectful, and be highly bothered with it, and most likely make passive aggressive comments on it.  4.) She’s not fucking invited.  You can absolutely have your feelings of disappointment and hurt about not being invited.  But that’s your responsibility to deal and process that (maybe a chance to self reflect on why you weren’t invited 🤷🏻‍♀️) and not put it on others pressuring them to have you invited.  And yes, you are Chelsea’s parental guardian and it’s in your right to say she can’t go, kinda fucked that you did a childish thing by saying she can’t go if your not invited but it’s in your right to make that choice so I respect it.  The most frustrating part of this is that Mollys mom can’t respect choices out of her control and also be happy and appreciate her daughter beating cancer, instead making it about her.   I’m not saying she can’t celebrate with her daughter or she shouldn’t have time to be with her daughter, but obviously there’s a lot of relationship healing that needs to happen and a surprise party is not the place or time for that. 

So Taylor and I stood firm on her not being invited and the siblings respected that, (most of them even agreed).  The day of the party came, we got Mollys younger brother to come up from college and distract her for a few hours as Taylor and I set up.  All the invited guest came, waiting to surprise Molly.  She came home and was actually surprised, (there were a few close calls on the surprise being blown so we got lucky).  There were customized cookies that said “fuck cancer” and “look at you beating cancer and shit” which she thought were hilarious.  We also got her a cancer cell piñata so she could beat cancer again 😜, which she loved. We all had a great time celebrating and most importantly, Molly was happy.  We later confirmed with her and told her about her mom, and she said we did the right thing, because she wouldn’t have invited her either.

24,1ckfkxi,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend’s ugly chair?,"Hi, longtime lurker first time poster. My (31F) boyfriend (42M) and I had a major house fire this past December and we lost 80% of our belongings. Amongst the items that were saved was my boyfriend’s 10 year old, dark green, ugly (in my opinion), oversized zero gravity chair. Sigh. 

Two months ago, we bought our first home as a couple. It was quite pricey, but we both work very hard and were a little traumatized from the fire and having moved several times over the last few years that we really wanted to choose a home we could imagine ourselves in for many years. 

My boyfriend (self admittedly) has no sense of style. He told me to decorate and design the house however I like. This is fine, but I also work full time and there is quite a lot of house to decorate and shop for and these things don’t come naturally to me so I’ve spent a lot of time researching and choosing how I imagine each room to be designed. 

We have a second living room, that we purchased a 150” projector screen for, and this would become our little ‘cinema room’. I LOVE movies and it’s one of my favourite ways to decompress. I got a sofa that fit perfectly in the space (it’s a bit squishy L shape couch that takes up a big portion of the room).

Well I guess you can imagine where he decided he wanted to place is old ugly zero gravity chair…yep. First off, I would have to remove a section of the couch, and it would just ruin the whole flow and stick out like a sore thumb. Secondly, we have very few moments together as a couple to cuddle and relax (on the average night less than 45 min), and this is primarily where we have been cuddling. So if he starts sitting in this dumb chair, well I’ll be by myself…this chair is basically the other woman in my eyes. 

I tried calmly explaining to him how it would completely ruin my vision for the room, and how I feel like it would also affect our couple time. But he’s telling me that I am essentially choosing my design over his confort and back pain. Also, that it’s been his only request etc etc. Not true; he is very particular on how he likes things to be ‘practical’ (ex: he likes everything in the home to be ‘smart’ like shades, lights, switches, locks etc and I happily pay for half of everything despite hating the look of them). Also important to note that I pay for my half of the entire house, as I’m sure some people will wonder.

He now says he doesn’t want to talk about the chair. That he feels it’s unfair. I’ve told him he can literally put it anywhere else in the house and I’ll be happy. But I know where he wants it…

Background:

-I have been really stressed about the number of people coming to the wedding because it is turning out to be very expensive and I am trying to keep the price down.

-I have always wanted a small wedding. I would like the event to be more intimate so that I feel comfortable being vulnerable. I don’t want to feel like I have to put on a “show” in front of a huge group of people, when I feel like the day should be about our love for each other. 

-We are already inviting quite a few people (imo)… ~60 for my side ~80 on his. 


The Situation:

-My fiancé has a half-brother (let’s call him Sean) who he is not particularly close with. This half-brother has a step-daughter (20YO, let’s call her Cass) who my fiancé is even less close with.

-Sean’s wife/Cass’s mom called my FMIL about a month ago and asked if Cass could bring her boyfriend to the wedding. FMIL said no. 

-Sean’s wife then texted my fiancé just shortly after and asked if Cass could bring her boyfriend to the wedding. He said no. 

-We have just recently found out that Cass’ boyfriend will be flying with her when she travels to the wedding. Apparently she isn’t the biggest fan of flying and he is coming as support. The flight is about an hour long. Sean and his wife are driving (~12 hour drive) but she isn’t driving with them so that she can get home faster after the wedding. 


The Dilemma:

-They are now asking again if he can come to the wedding since he will already be in the area. 

-My fiancé and I talked about it again today and I said that I guess we can make a seating chart and if there will be extra room at their table then he can come. We haven’t told them this yet though. 

-But I’m now just thinking that I don’t want him there just out of principle. I feel kinda manipulated into having him… they are just bringing him and I feel like they are guilting us into having him since he’ll already be in the area. That family makes no effort into having a relationship with either of us so why should this person get to come? But I feel like it would be petty to not invite him now. 

-My fiancé just wants to keep the peace. I feel bad that he has to be the middle man here.

26,1ckf8rv,"AITA For telling new neighbors exactly what we were going to do, and then doing it","
We inherited a house and land when my fil died. It is a nice house on two acres in the country. No HOA. No neighborhood, just a neighbor to one side and to the back. Everyone one else was further away. We decided we would take the opportunity to use the land, put a couple of tiny houses on it for our kids and set them up. We brought this up multiple times with pretty much everyone who would listen. We discussed legality, viability, all repercussions,  everything. We told everyone our dreams of a homestead of a semi-village where our children lived here on the land with us (albeit in tiny homes) and we had farm animals and gardens and whatever sustainable practices we could muster. Nobody poo-pooed our plans outright. The back neighbor said we wouldn't be able to install a septic but they were wrong. The side neighbor said property values might go down but they weren't planning on selling so it wouldn't matter. This is a place in rural Arkansas where people have cattle, horses, goats, chickens, ducks, emus, multiple buildings on their property, including one person about a quarter mile away who has a rv set up for living in. People have dog runs and broke down vehicles and tractors and barns and all sorts of stuff. The property in front of us has an old industrial scale chicken factory (can't be seen front the road).

Today the guy behind us was using an auger and I walked over and joked ""are you digging for gold?"" And he went off on me about how he is installing ""a shield"" because our dog keeps going over there and pooping on his land and he doesn't appreciate the eyesore of our buildings and how we are bringing property values down. However, He has no fences to keep other dogs out, and the people behind him have two very large very hyper retrievers who regularly walk all over his land leaving huge piles (and on my land too). So it isn't uncommon for free range dogs in this area. I make it a point to keep our dogs inside as much as possible, or on leads, or in the fences we have been able to put up.

 I explained that we are trying to help our kids because life is hard nowadays and he mentioned something about ""did you ask anyone (for permission to put up buildings)"". Then he goes on to say that one of the other guys behind him ""has to mow because you wont"", referring to land that isn't ours to mow which confused the hell out of me. Our land has weeds which come almost to the knee but we are allowing to grow a bit because there's flowers and we are trying to allow the beehive to gather more locally and the weeds are pretty spare, just a little tall.

I mentioned that we are working on putting up a fence but trying to figure out what would be best. I told him I had hoped that if he had a problem with something that he would have said something to us sooner. He said everyone is mad. Him. The neighbor beside us. His neighbors behind him.

We brought this up multiple times with pretty much everyone who would listen. We discussed legality, viability, all repercussions,  everything. We told everyone our dreams of a homestead of a semi-village where our children lived here on the land with us (albeit in tiny homes) and we had farm animals and gardens and whatever sustainable practices we could muster. Nobody poo-pooed our plans outright. The back neighbor said we wouldn't be able to install a septic but they were wrong. The side neighbor said property values might go down but they weren't planning on selling so it wouldn't matter. This is a place in rural Arkansas where people have cattle, horses, goats, chickens, ducks, emus, multiple buildings on their property, including one person about a quarter mile away who has a rv set up for living in. People have dog runs and broke down vehicles and tractors and barns and all sorts of stuff. The property in front of us has an old industrial scale chicken factory (can't be seen front the road).

Today the guy behind us was using an auger and I walked over and joked ""are you digging for gold?"" And he went off on me about how he is installing ""a shield"" because our dog keeps going over there and pooping on his land and he doesn't appreciate the eyesore of our buildings and how we are bringing property values down. However, He has no fences to keep other dogs out, and the people behind him have two very large very hyper retrievers who regularly walk all over his land leaving huge piles (and on my land too). So it isn't uncommon for free range dogs in this area. I make it a point to keep our dogs inside as much as possible, or on leads, or in the fences we have been able to put up.

 I explained that we are trying to help our kids because life is hard nowadays and he mentioned something about ""did you ask anyone (for permission to put up buildings)"". Then he goes on to say that one of the other guys behind him ""has to mow because you wont"", referring to land that isn't ours to mow which confused the hell out of me. Our land has weeds which come almost to the knee but we are allowing to grow a bit because there's flowers and we are trying to allow the beehive to gather more locally and the weeds are pretty spare, just a little tall.

I mentioned that we are working on putting up a fence but trying to figure out what would be best. I told him I had hoped that if he had a problem with something that he would have said something to us sooner. He said everyone is mad. Him. The neighbor beside us. His neighbors behind him. People in town. Everyone. ",0.0,1.0592636,1,0

28,1ckez4p,"AITA for going against my parents’ wishes of going to a prestigious school, and instead going to the school that gave me the most money?","Hi everyone! For context I (18F) got into the University of Virginia (UVA), and the College of William and Mary (W&M). UVA was one of my top schools for the longest time because I thought it was prestigious and it was pretty good for business, since that is what I am majoring in. However, I applied to other schools that I would go to besides UVA, in case I had gotten rejected. I mainly applied to schools within my state and nearby states.

 I got into UVA, and that was exciting! On the contrary… the price tag was not attractive. I would have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to UVA. On the other hand, I got accepted to W&M with a full ride! And a research grant, which would look very good to graduate schools and potential jobs! Additionally, I would get the newest dorms available because I got the specific research grant! 

I told my parents my options and they still want me to go to UVA because it is better for business. My parents said not to worry about money, but I do not want to be financially tied to them because they might take away my tuition or have control over my life since they are quite religious and conservative.

 I toured both campuses, and I honestly liked W&M better because it was less busy compared to UVA! And… no student debt! Also, everyone was more helpful and friendly to me at W&M when I toured, and the tour was actually led by someone whereas UVA’s tour was self-led. Overall, I just liked the feeling of W&M better. 

Now my parents are very disappointed in me in choosing W&M and trying to get me to change my decision. They are saying that I am selfish, careless, and too young to be making major life decisions. However, I asked all of my counselors, teachers, my smartest peers and just about everyone said they would choose W&M, given my decisions. I tried to explain to my parents that undergrad does not matter, and that I’ll go to business school anyways after college/university. They are still firm on their decision because they are “immigrants who worked hard to give me the best possibilities, and to take the largest opportunity, which is UVA.” They say money isn’t a problem, but I am not comfortable with the decision. They keep sending me statistics about how UVA is ranked higher and all of that, and are guilt-tripping me trying to change my mind. They have been crying non-stop about my decision (I haven’t committed yet), but honestly I think they just want bragging rights that I go to UVA. 

So, Reddit AITA for choosing to go to my choice of university/college over my parents’ preferences? Any help would be appreciated because they won’t support me anymore and I will be disowned if I go through with my decision. 

Thank you. 


EDIT: Thank you all for your support, it means a lot going through such a stressful time. To answer some questions, I will be majoring in business with a concentration in finance and also double major with either statistics or math. I plan to get an internship or job after college and have work experience and eventually get my MBA (hopefully!) So, the cost of UVA for 4 years is about $80k+ and W&M has no loans attached to it either, everything will be paid for by the scholarship or grants. Also, W&M accepts more of my AP credits of that helps lol. Additionally, we are South Asian lol.

29,1ckeuxl,WIBTA for asking my ex not to talk to my family?,"So my ex partner (16NB) broke up with me (16M) a couple weeks ago, we were together for just over four months and we had both met each others families. The break up wasnt expected but i didnt really take it to heart, however we havent spoke at all since and i feel very bitter towards them. 

They spoke often with my sister because they had a lot of common interests but i expressed whilst we were together that them talking over the phone or social media every day made me uncomfortable as my sister is 11. When we broke up I spoke with my mum about how i could go about sealing that gap for good because they were still in contact after we broke up. My mum said that i shouldnt get in the way of who my ex keeps contact with and that it wasnt my business, however i kept a mental note that if it kept going i would have words with my sister about it. 

This week my mum posted a couple things on facebook involving me and my sister who my ex commented on and liked, which made me feel very uncomfortable, especially as i had immediately unfriended their parents after we broke up. 

I think i should give them the firm response and tell them to back off before this spirals, but my mum’s comment has made me feel like making them cut contact would be a dick move and could make conflicts worse?

32,1cl5349,AITA For telling my mom we’re moving out,"Mom is mad because a day ago, i told her when me and my fiancé get married, we were thinking about our life afterwards and whats next in our future together, and since she said we could decide if we want to live on our own after the lease is up (November 30th 2024) 

She got quiet and said well you guys are a couple so do what you want for yourselves but in a really snarky tone. My heart sank because i didn’t expect her to take so much offense to it. And then she said maybe I need to start thinking about my future too. I think I’m gonna move to Georgia because it’s more people of color  there (me and mom are black) and it’s more job opportunities since they speak English there.(my fiancé is Puerto Rican. and the town we moved to is mostly Hispanic.) she said there may be more job opportunities there too. And she said it in a really biting tone. 

She was like I’m almost 50 years old. I will be 50 at the end of this year. I’m tired of constantly starting over and I guess im going to do me. Then she becomes visibly angry and said i guess i sold my house and stuff for no reason. And she said we were basically using her to get what we have and then tossing her away. I tried to reassure her that we aren’t trying to offend her we just were deciding our next steps after marriage. She also thought that we were going to be living together for a few years so that when I had kids, she could be in the house with us and help out.

My mom is upset and posting about betrayal and being used on her Facebook and using the knife “someone” used to stab her in the back to cut them off. As well as finding a post she posted about me a year ago to repost it and say how true it still is. 

she also posted about people building a foundation off of her and then that person finishing the structure with someone else leaving her alone. With another one (all in one day)

she is saying this because she often offers to help me out with financial stuff since I’m on ssi, she said she’d help with things such as the wedding since my fiancé is covering a giant bulk of it. She offered to help so that we can get married when we want to, which was sweet of her and we were so grateful. 

Unfortunately she often uses her purchases to hold over me whenever I do something she dislikes so she can say that I’m using her when she offered it to me I didn’t ask her for it. And she often gets frustrated because i am to sturborn to ask when i need help. 

I don’t know what to do I’ve been crying several times a day for the past 2 days. My fiancé has been supportive and helping cheer me up but my heart is still so broken and I don’t want to lose her.

I (21F) was bullied. My parents’ got divorced. I was the only kid in my class with divorced parents, and I kept that secret.   
  
In an attempt to fit in, I started listening to 3 bands: A, B, and C. I’d also learn about them. I felt represented upon learning that 3 members of A, 1 member of B(at the time), and 2 members of C (one being fav) had divorced parents.  A became the most popular and remain popular to this day.  
  
Admittedly, I sometimes tend to harp on things for too long. People have told me I monologue too much about the bands. I've also been told that this behavior sounds like they're my ""special interests"".Teachers thought I was autistic, and I was evaluated but never diagnosed as autistic.  
  
In 2019, 2 high school peers, Joanna & Chantel, were gossiping about me (specifically about how “weird” I was because I didn't go out often like them) at the store while following my mom. I was doing a French exam while this was happening, so I only found out about it afterwards. Mom yelled saying it was my fault, so I must change all my behaviors. Sis agreed.  
  
The pandemic came, and so did an ""exposing account"" on Twitter about my fav member of C. Since we were stuck in the house, I would read it and discuss with mom and sis. They told me at uni, it'd be better to talk about A over B and C. A is the most popular where we are from. They were concerned because having mainstream interests helps socialization thus increasing happiness and belonging. They were concerned for my social skills due to the paragraphs above and because teachers would say that I needed to work on my social skills in response to any complaints they would get about me being bullied.

One day, I was on the train with my sis and we ran into Sabeeka. She greeted me, then asked how my Christmas was. I said “It was good. I stayed in due to a snowstorm, but at least I was warm. I got a hot chocolate machine."" Sis began to shoot dirty looks when she then asked ""Did anything new happen with C? What about the exposing account?"" I then said ""I'm not sure. I don't think so.

Moh. panicked and asked someone else for help, resulting in us not being able to participate due to huge costs. So we, and other guests argued. She called us selfish for not wanting the bride to have a nice day and we tried to accomodate her wishes, but making it cheaper. 

It's not that we couldn't have saved up for it, but seeing the party is only a month away and we haven't saved more than the initial amount, we cannot pay what they want us to. 

In addition, moh wanted several others to pay for all of them to go when they only could come to some of it. 

Now we've backed out completely because we can't sway her opinions, which is a shame because my wife wanted the bride to have a nice day.

35,1cl4sfa,AITA for leaving my friend,"
I (17f) was on a school trip with the band and was with my best friend, L, on this trip. There was also someone on this trip with this other girl who I particularly hate. On the last day of the trip she decided to be in our friend group voluntarily. After I specifically told her “hey I really really don’t like her, let’s go she has other people she can hang out with” she said no. I couldn’t take it anymore and started crying after an hour of her making fun of me and I left the group. I tend to hold my breath when I cry and ended up passing out on a chair for 10 minutes and L never looking for me. After waking up I kept on crying for hours because they didn’t care about me at all. 
On the ride home L sat next to me and acted like nothing happened. I asked them why they would leave me and they said “I can hang out with other people” which I understand but not even caring and leaving me alone for hours on end and not caring especially when we were hours away from home seems a little crazy to me?? Their acting like I’m crazy for saying that “hey why did you leave me for hours to hang out with someone who I hate” 

Info to help:
Me and L have been friends since 3rd grade

The girl I hate would say things I say but louder and made fun of the way I spoke, laughed, who I hanged out with, my past, and more. She is also the most annoying human being alive.

There was another guy, but I understand him more because we don’t know each other THAT well and he is friends with the other girl so I understand staying with her

L always said that she hated her so I don’t understand why she felt the need to be friends with her so quickly

I am a little bitch baby; like I’m very emotional. I may sound like a little baby and I am one. L knows this about me

I started business in my early 20s and now Im considerably wealthy. My husband has a daughter, jane, who’s only 1 year older than Mary. We got married 2 years ago and one of our main “aims” with this marriage was to have a nice accompany as we both had almost the same experience with love/sex/birth as his ex left him with Jane just like my ex left me with Mary. However,Im objectively wealthier than my husband, he’s not poor , I just make more money and finances never been a main topic to us both thankfully. 

Now Mary works in a certain institution and makes her own money and pays her own bills. But I also like to spoil her with money and luxury and we travel alot together sometimes I give her money to travel alone. Like she’s fine on her own financially but I give her always. Also Mary has a boyfriend he’s somewhat well off and always pays for their dates so Mary wanted to surprise him on his birthday but her plans were kind off above budget so I paid the rest. 

Everything was fine until  Jane called me saying she wants me to give her 2K for her and her friends to travel for a little vacation. I told her 2K for a vacation is alot I can help her with sone but she then brought up everything I get and pay for Mary and never her. I told her because Mary has no one but me, as my husband doesn’t contribute anything to Mary so obviously I’ll direct my efforts to her and she also work she doesn’t just depend on me. Let’s just say that phone call wasn’t the nicest. 

I know the whole perception of if you marry someone with kids then they’re your kids too, sure Jane is not a kid she was 21 when I got married to her father.

39,1cl4e4t,AITA for not spending time with guests,"This a throw-away account. I (25f) am in my first year of grad school, and its finals season. I live with my parents to save money, but at this point, it feels like home isn't a good option. My dad has a really big family and has always been a big family man. He insists that my brother (35M) and I are too separated from the family and we never have time for family events. I do go to family events, parties, baby showers, etc., whenever I can, but school has been a big time consumer in my life plus other responsibilities like work or just basic personal things like hobbies and friends. 

Today, things took a turn. I have a final project due for a class. This project is due before finals officially start since our professor wanted us to get it out of the way beforehand. I had been working on this project throughout the semester, but yesterday, I realized I was missing a big part of the assignment. This completely threw off my timeline for getting this project done, and I would need to pull an all-nighter to get this project finished on time. Since yesterday, I have been chugging caffeine and barely looked away from my computer, trying to finish as quickly as possible. 

Well, my dad invited my aunt's ex-husband and his daughter, whom I had never met before, over to the house. I was locked up in my room with my typing away, when my mom entered and told me that my dad wanted me to come downstairs. I told her I was busy and I couldn't, but she reminded me how sensitive my dad gets when it comes to family things. If I am being completely honest, I did not want to see anyone. It's finals season, and I am tired, anxious, and a total mess. I don't have the energy to entertain guests, especially guests that I had no idea were coming. 

This is the part where I might be the asshole. After some time, my mom kept texting me to go downstairs, so I did, stood by the end of the final step, waved at the guests, and said, ""Hello,"" and ""Sorry, I have something really important to finish,"" and then ran back upstairs. After some time, they left, and my dad made an absolute scene out of this. He said I was incredibly rude and that it made him look bad. When he is that angry, it's best not to argue with him, but he also has a tendency not to let things go. So he's been walking around the house basically yelling, saying that he has the most inconsiderate kids, that we care about no one but ourselves, and that he works all day, and my brother and I are ungrateful. While I understand that might not have been the politest thing to do, I think he is really blowing this whole thing out of proportion and making it seem like I am a terrible person. Frankly, this whole situation, plus the anxiety from my project and the caffeine, are really making me feel more anxious and frustrated, so this post is also for me to release some stress because, at this point, I can't even focus on my project.

40,1cl3uxp,AITA for having expectations?,"Throw away because my family are on Reddit.

Background: My daughter (F14) had agreed to help me at a regular local community event, but arranged to do something else beforehand and despite being begged to be on time was late, resulting in me having to find last minute help.

My daughter and I have in the past had some huge rows, and I really wanted to avoid another, so I asked my wife (F45) if she might be the one (if my daughter was late) to tell her that I was disappointed. My wife told me that she refused to “tell off” my daughter. I indicated that telling her off was not what I had asked for. I just wanted my daughter to know that I was disappointed, but also to avoid an argument. My wife told me that to have expectations of my teenage daughter was wrong, and that fulfilling her agreed responsibility was simply not important. I responded that it was important to ME. She replied that it wasn’t all about me, and that what I wanted wasn’t important. Hearing that nothing I personally care about mattered to her, really hurt.

I think that having expectations of others is reasonable, even necessary, and that my expectations of fulfilling commitments were also reasonable (and my daughter herself agreed). I will admit that my response here was far from mature (and this is where I may have been the asshole). If having reasonable expectations of others was wrong I said that from now on, and until I receive an apology and a recognition of her being wrong, no expectations could be had of me. I also would have no expectations of others (fair is fair after all). No expectations regarding meals, chores, intimacy or anything else, and I in turn would do what I liked, and should not be expected to ensure the washing was done, the kids were picked up, that I was home for any specific time etc etc. Note…Not that I would not do any of these things, but if I did that it would only be because I wanted to, not because it was “expected”. With that said, I stood in front of her, poured and knocked back a large whisky and announced that I could no longer be expected to pick up our son (M17) from the station that evening, and either she’d have to collect him, or I’d organize a cab.

My thought was that a while without being able to rely on things that my wife expected of me to be done might get her to reconsider her position on “expectations”. 

Well following my ultimatum, heated words were exchanged, and my wife stormed out. My wife and I are currently giving each other the silent treatment.

41,1cl3t5h,AITA Because of my new unconventional pet,"My housemate, friend and basically sister (has been my brother's best friend since I was 3) is no longer speaking to me because I brought a giant water bug home and she said I couldn't keep it but I kept it anyway because I thought having a little aquarium in my room wouldn't hurt anyone, right? 

Wrong.

My housemate has a phobia of bugs, particularly flying bugs, that I didn't realise was so intense she'd forbid me from keeping a bug in a small, secure (and nicely decorated) tank in my bedroom. 

But the problem is, I'm extremely attached to this bug. His name is Nemo, I found him lost on the sidewalk and had been taking care of him all night before I brought him home. I learnt later that giant water bugs bite really bad but I'd been carrying him around on my hands and he didn't bite me and I know it's stupid but I feel like he chose me.

I have been wanting a pet for so long and setting up Nemo's adorable new aquarium has brought me so much joy. I know he is just a bug but I'm a highly sensitive and emotional person and I actually love this bug as if Ive just bought a puppy. There are already two dogs and a cat in the house and I just want a pet of my own.

In my mind I can't understand how it's any different to having a fish and I think it's ridiculous that she would tell me I'm not allowed a bug. It doesn't make any noise, it barely even moves at all.

I've always been sensitive to her phobia. I know it's serious and I always rescue her when moths get in the house and empathise when she comes home from work with stories about bugs that scared her. I really had no idea the bugs would still be so scary when locked in a pretty little tank.

I've tried to apologise for upsetting her but she ignored me and walked away. She wants me to get rid of the bug but I can't because he is my son.

Am I the asshole? We are both autistic, if that matters lol

- please stop telling me to let it go, Ive been very clear that's not an option. I love him. I'm going to talk to my boss about keeping him on my office desk or perhaps just move out, I don't really want to live somewhere I can't have pet bugs anyway

- please stop telling me to let it go, Ive been very clear that's not an option. I love him. I'm going to talk to my boss about keeping him on my office desk or perhaps just move out, I don't really want to live somewhere I can't have pet bugs anyway

- Ive decided I'm going to talk to her and help her understand how much I love Nemo, I think if she knew he's more than just a random bug to me she wouldn't mind me keeping him",1.0,1.0601524114608765,1,1
42,1cl3qc6,AITA for pushing away a friend I’ve known since elementary even if they didn’t really do anything?,"So I’ve had a friend since like 1st grade. She was someone in my close circle and one of the people I’d gravitate towards more often than not. But when middle school started things changed. I sat at lunch with her and my other friend, we still talked and I’d say hi to her when I saw her in the halls since we didn’t share any classes, but lunch always felt too quiet and uninviting. She’s constantly on her phone along with all my other elementary friends. she was usually kind of quiet, always wore a hoodie and didn’t start conversations. But now i see her using slang I’d never heard her use before and she always has her hoodie off. This isn’t bad, just seemed a bit odd for her.

But one day I was on my phone, playing games and what not, when I heard one of my old friends who was friends with her say. “The only friends you need are me and ___.” And my friend didn’t deny it. I was directly next to them but they didn’t seem to care if I heard it or not. While she wasn’t the one that said it, i still felt a bit hurt and started to sit about 2 tables down with some of my new friends that i had made. I’ve got one of them in all my classes so I grew really close to them and eventually ended up with a new friend group.

A while ago I had walked up to her, wanting to know what she thought of me. She said I was her best friend, and that’s why this bothers me so much. She didn’t nothing and isn’t even mad or upset when she has every right to be. She invited me to sit back at her table again and I agreed. But it still felt so quiet and forced. No one talked to each other, no one even looked up from their phones. I hated it and went back to my other seat the next day. The people I sat with had conversations and bonded over games, there’s was always noise and I liked it that way. There was noise at my other table, but that was from people around us at other tables. The noise at my new table was genuine conversations. 

I haven’t talked to my friend in months because it felt easier to push the thoughts away and focus on other things. But then i see her with a new person. They walk with her to all her classes, talk to her at lunch, and even sit in my old seat. I want to be happy for her but something about it still pains me. I still haven’t talked to her since like November and make it my goal to avoid her. I feel like I’m in the wrong here but my new friend said it’s okay to get distance from someone if they make me uncomfortable.

I am quite the night owl and prefer to sleep in, sometimes to 11 AM. In the past, they would open the curtains fully while I was still asleep, and it would be around 7-8 AM. I totally understand that they must get on with their day and would like more light in the mornings, but it does make it hard to properly sleep. I think it is important to mention that when I do stay up late, I am either completely out of the room or on the bed (with no lights on, making no noise, etc.) And I am totally fine with them turning off the light at night before they sleep. Additionally, I am also very respectful when I happen to wake up before them and have to go to class, not opening the windows or making a lot of noise. In the past, they have also had friends (guy friends too) over early in the morning and will speak loudly to each other while I am trying to rest. One of the roommates in the past has never been super accommodating with one example of her arguing for the desk I wanted, even though both of them chose their beds without me (She ended up getting both). Also, I would like to mention that you can clearly see everything in the room without opening the curtains as the light leaks in a lot on the sides a lot so it is not pitch black, and they have side lamps that they can use too.

Recently, they asked if I could get a mask to sleep with because it really disrupts their schedules. I am totally good with getting a mask btw. But they asked me this after clearly texting each other in front of me and whispering in each others' ears. Also, based off their behavior in the past, they definitely talked about me after they left the room.

We usually play three games at a time regardless of who wins but he started putting away the game. I asked if he didn't want to play a third and he said no. I was a bit surprised and asked why not and he relented and played a third with me. I won and he was like ""this is why I didn't want to play another game!"" and stormed off in a huff. I honestly don't care if I win or lose, I just like spending time with my husband. I gave him some space, checked in with him periodically throughout the day to see if he needed anything and he always said no.

The plan for that evening was for him to watch the basketball game and after we would watch a scary movie while making s'mores. During the first half of the game I came and sat with him on the couch. I listened to a book with my headphones while playing a game on my phone. During commercial breaks I would ask him how the game was going and he would answer but not talk much. When I finished my book I was getting hungry and was going to reheat some leftovers for dinner and asked if he wanted me to make him a plate and he said no. Around this time he moved from the couch to his office to watch the game and I watched stuff on my computer for the rest of the early evening.

50,1cl1lql,AITA for telling my boyfriend it's gross to piss in his car?,"Throwaway account. I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for just over a year now. He recently had to move back in with his parents in the suburbs and is now commuting at least 40 minutes to and from work every day. (If traffic is really backed up it can take him close to an hour.) During the drive home, there isn't really anywhere you can stop to use a bathroom once you are out of city limits - it's just long stretches of field until you get into the residential areas. For medical reasons he needs to stay very hydrated at all times, which of course, means he is peeing at all times. 

Last night we went out for dinner and on the way home I noticed an empty ice cream bucket on his back seat. He keeps his car pretty immaculate so it was strange to see any kind of trash just lying on the seat. I laughed and said something like, ""Wow, really letting yourself go, huh?"" He said, ""Haha, no, that's my emergency piss bucket."" I thought he was joking but it turns out he was dead serious. I asked him if he's actually used it and still entirely deadpan, says, ""Two or three times, yeah."" He told me he dumps it in the dirt behind his fence and rinses it out with a hose once he gets home. I was shocked by this. I told him it was disgusting and he can wait until he gets home because he's not 3 years old. Or better yet, just pee before you leave like a civilized adult. I could understand if he was dealing with incontinence or a leaky bladder, but he doesn't have either. His ability to hold his pee is the same as anyone else, he just has to do it a lot. 

My comment about him acting like a 3 year old upset him quite a bit. He snapped back with something like, ""toddlers don't drink 4 litres of water every day, and comparing me to one is really offensive."" He dropped me off without kissing me goodbye like he always does and didn't contact me at all until this afternoon, and even now is just giving me half-assed, one word responses.

During the drive home, there isn't really anywhere you can stop to use a bathroom once you are out of city limits - it's just long stretches of field until you get into the residential areas. For medical reasons he needs to stay very hydrated at all times, which of course, means he is peeing at all times. 

Last night we went out for dinner and on the way home I noticed an empty ice cream bucket on his back seat. He keeps his car pretty immaculate so it was strange to see any kind of trash just lying on the seat. I laughed and said something like, ""Wow, really letting yourself go, huh?"" He said, ""Haha, no, that's my emergency piss bucket."" I thought he was joking but it turns out he was dead serious. I asked him if he's actually used it and still entirely deadpan, says, ""Two or three times, yeah."" He told me he dumps it in the dirt behind his fence and rinses it out with a hose once he gets home. I was shocked by this. I told him it was disgusting and he can wait until he gets home because he's not 3 years old. Or better yet, just pee before you leave like a civilized adult. I could understand if he was dealing with incontinence or a leaky bladder, but he doesn't have either. His ability to hold his pee is the same as anyone else, he just has to do it a lot. 

My comment about him acting like a 3 year old upset him quite a bit. He snapped back with something like, ""toddlers don't drink 4 litres of water every day, and comparing me to one is really offensive."" He dropped me off without kissing me goodbye like he always does and didn't contact me at all until this afternoon, and even now is just giving me half-assed, one word responses.

51,1cl1j41,WIBTA for not attending my brother's high school graduation?,"(cw brief discussion of child abuse)

I (21f) have a little brother (17nb) who is graduating high school this June. My brother and I have a really close relationship and in any other circumstances, I would be first in line for graduation tickets.

However, there are a few problems with this. I start a job in a new state on June 7th. His graduation is June 13th. I also live in a college dorm and my school expects me to move out by June 8th at noon. Although I might be able to get my employers to be flexible and let me fly out the 14th (hard maybe), I don't have any friends or family members to stay with until that time after I move out. I would have to stay in a hotel or AirBnB, which would amount to the cost of a small vacation.

Most of my funds are from financial aid. I have a significant amount of money from this but because it is aid I try to only spend it on necessities. I recently had to drop 1k on driver's ed to fulfill my new job's license requirements and I also have to pay for travel expenses very soon and so I'm hesitant to spend large sums at the moment. I could technically afford paying for a hotel but it seems like a dishonest way to spend aid money and I planned to return a lot of my aid so I wouldn't be taking up funds from a more disadvantaged student who might need it more than me right now. Between returning some of that aid and my travel expenses I don't feel comfortable spending that much money on an AirBnb.

The final issue with this is my family. Our parents will be taking my brother to his graduation and will be there the entire ceremony. Unfortunately, our parents are abusive. I went no contact with my stepmom when I first entered college but I've only recently gone no contact with my father after he refused to pay for my brother's much needed medical care and then gave my stepmom my new number.

If I go to graduation, I could just sit in another part of the area and avoid them, but that means I wouldn't be able to talk to my brother before and after the ceremony or attend the post graduation parties with him. I would watch him get his diploma, but I'd hardly be able to celebrate with him at all. I don't want to risk interacting with my parents, especially with my dad's current repeated attempts to contact me and the fact it'd probably trigger the hell out of me.

However, because of our family situation, my brother considers me a parent. He relies on me for emotional support, help with choosing colleges, teaching him life skills etc. My brother is more or less like my adopted child, which would make missing his graduation hurt all the worse. 

I think they livestream graduation so I could watch that but it's not the same as being there. My brother will also be staying with me in the dorms for a weekend in late May so I was thinking I could throw a bit of a graduation party for him even if I couldn't go to the real one.

My mom had surgery 4 days ago and for better accommodation we decided that she would stay at my grandparents house while she recovers. That means I also will be spending most of the week here and staying full time on weekends.

It's common knowledge in my family that I absolutely adore lychees, they are my favorite fruit ever and I rarely eat because they only grow in May-June, so I only get to eat them once a year.

2 days ago, I bought a bag of lychees and brought it to my grandparents house just for the weekend so I could enjoy them and then I'll take them to my house. I told people not to grab them because they are mine and it is the only bag I'm gonna get this year because we no longer speak to some family members that had a lychee tree. 

Now, I'm not a person who doesn't share her stuff, I sometimes bake brownies and cakes and share them with my family, along with other fruit I buy or desserts or meals or whatever we buy; we tend to share. 
But this is genuinely the one thing that I don't want them to eat because it's my one time a year to enjoy them. So I put a  don't touch note on top of the container that had the lychees.
And now my grandma is calling me selfish for not wanting to share my fruit, so AITA?

EDIT: someone in the comments suggested that I make it clear that I am a minor, so buying the bags myself isn't an option, my dad bought them for me. If I could I would've bought 5 bags but I don't have any money.
Also for those saying to put them in my room, I don't have a room here, I'm sleeping in the room my mom is staying at and she just had surgery so it's full of her stuff, I don't have a place to put them.

We were inseparable, had been roommates for years and did almost everything together. During the lockdown our friendship grew distant (as many did) and when we came out of lockdown things were different. They both forgot my birthday, they bailed on me repeatedly because they ""didn't have time"" and then were posting on social media photos of them hanging out with everyone else in our friend group. So I stopped prioritizing them the same way they weren't prioritizing me.

About 6mos later J got pregnant. The only time D or J spoke to me they only wanted to talk about them. I chose not to attend J's baby shower (for a long list of reasons) and J decided she ""had enough"" sending me a lengthy message on messenger calling me a flaky terrible friend, that she made sure not to plan her shower on my birthday so I could attend, and that I had made no effort to maintain our friendship. And that she was hurt by an incident where I couldn't attend something almost a year prior, ignoring the fact that she had not responded to any of the dozens of texts and messages I had sent her over the past year.

Today I went for brunch with D who was 45 minutes late, didn't ask or show interest in anything about my life and spent more than half of the brunch justifying Js treatment of me, and telling me I just needed to get over it because it's been almost four years.

I told D that I was not even entertaining reconciling our friendship without J acknowledging and apologizing for the ways she hurt me. And that J had to do that herself, not through D as some half-assed mediator.

D was upset and after we paid our bills I went to use the washroom and when I came out she had left without saying goodbye. I feel like I'm not the AH in this situation but I don't even know anymore. At this point I don't even want to see D anymore because I'm tired of explaining the same thing over and over and having me feelings invalidated by her because our trio getting back together is more important to her than my personal feelings.

At the two year mark, my bf and I hit a hard patch and broke up for a couple weeks.

Okay, now to the problem. We’re graduating in a week! The original plan was his mom had made a reservation for a nice restaurant. Then my parents were going to come. I informed her of this weeks ago and she tried to make the reservation bigger but couldn’t. So she suggested to just have a party at her house.

A friend comes over and she asks what it is, I explain to her we keep getting other peoples mail and the story about the thank you card I opened. We joked about what could be inside and wanting to find out, but obviously didn’t open it. Apparently the upstairs neighbor heard our conversation (open window? Thin walls?) and knocked on our door.

He asked if we received this card and I explain yes and that I was embarrassed. Apparently it was his middle name and he gave the sender the wrong unit number. I then ask if he saw the package and if it was his, he said no. I then explained that I took it and planned on returning it to USPS.

For context, the group we're a part of goes from 10-20 on a youth level, then from 20-25 on an adult level. Yesterday, I heard from two different people that they were talking about me behind my back to one of their other friends. I messaged them about it later in the day, though I admit the way I went about it wasn't the right way. I was talking out of anger, and I should have waited to talk to them after I had calmed down. I had said ""so you're talking shit about me now?"" with no other context. They lashed out at me, turning the situation around to make it my fault before completely cutting me off. I tried messaging again to apologize for the way I went about it, but the only response I got was ""I am no longer your friend and I am no longer participating in our youth group."" I've been completely broken hearted about this, as they've been my best friend for so long. I discovered later last night that they had messaged one of the leaders of our youth group explaining that we'd had a fight, but said some pretty awful things about me.

For context, the group we're a part of goes from 10-20 on a youth level, then from 20-25 on an adult level. Yesterday, I heard from two different people that they were talking about me behind my back to one of their other friends. I messaged them about it later in the day, though I admit the way I went about it wasn't the right way. I was talking out of anger, and I should have waited to talk to them after I had calmed down. I had said ""so you're talking shit about me now?"" with no other context. They lashed out at me, turning the situation around to make it my fault before completely cutting me off. I tried messaging again to apologize for the way I went about it, but the only response I got was ""I am no longer your friend and I am no longer participating in our youth group."" I've been completely broken hearted about this, as they've been my best friend for so long.

59,1ckyvhz,AITA for wanting to work longer over summer?,"This summer I am planning to work as a camp counselor at a place I was at last year as well, and recently I was talking with my (20) current partner (19) about the number of camps, each 11 days long spanning over the two months of summer vacation, I wanted to go on. 

For context, we have been seeing each other, not yet officially dating, since December of 2023. The subject of my work was brought up because we were talking about summer jobs, I am a student and he is currently looking for a job (he’s been out of one for a few months now, it’s important to the story). Because of him now not qualifying for the jobless fund in our country, I have been the one having to put out money for him for the last months from the money I get from my parents for university, with him promising to pay me back as soon as he gets a job, which landed me in living more “paycheck to paycheck” rather than the comfort of having some savings put away at the end of each month. He has now racked up an 2.5k debt from me, which is now pretty uncomfortable to live with for the both of us. 

Calculating from what money I made last year, I came to a conclusion that I would have to work on a total of four camps, which would put me at roughly 5.4k and a comfortable money spot for me to be at by the end of summer, as I have a roadtrip with my friends coming up by the end of September. 

Here is where I might be the AH. My partner, hearing that I wanted to be gone for work during those 44 days of the summer vacation, declared that me being gone for so long would put him in a bad mental state, being away from me and not seeing me for this long. To me, that seems a bit like being way too dependent on me than I’m comfortable with. I explained to him that I’d be most comfortable working during that time to earn the money over summer, as it is the only job I currently have set up for the near future. To him it is impossible to mentally accommodate me being at work for this long. 

Just to add, yes, we have some events planned together over the summer and he also will most likely be working, having resorted to applying for a job at a nearby KFC and heading in for an interview on Monday, which as I am writing this is tomorrow.

During the argument we had about it on Friday night he really pissed me off by basically saying ""well at least my pals want to see me and make plans to see me"", basically making a dig at the fact my friends dont plan much with me which I thought was out of order and he said it deliberately to upset me.

Everyone seemed in agreeance, so I booked us all together with the reasoning that it would save us a lot of money (my fiancé and I make good money,  but I wanted the cruise to be financially doable for my parents). 

My fiancé a week after now told me that she feels uncomfortable sleeping in a room with my parents (they will have a queen bed, she will be on a bunk bed, and I will be on a couch bed). I told her that it’s too late to change now, as I paid the full payment and locked us into that room. She wanted me to book us another room, but I told her that I don’t feel that is an option, because its looking like it would cost us ~$1000+ to change to the lowest quality room, when our original fare was ~$250 a person. I said that in my opinion you don’t spend too much time in your room except to sleep, so it wouldn’t be as bad as she thinks.

I said that in my opinion you don’t spend too much time in your room except to sleep, so it wouldn’t be as bad as she thinks. My family is use to sleeping all in the same room to save money, while her family does not have the same experience

68,1ckx7y4,AITA for getting my cousin an expensive gift?,"I (22F) am a college student and I live in a fairly big city in my country. This is where I met my girlfriend, Lisa (29F). Lisa is rich! She has more money than I could have imagined the first time I met her. She also doesn't brag or show off her wealth, therefore people don't really know this fact about her.   
Lisa and I have been dating for almost three years now. This info is not necessarily a secret in my family. Both my parents and some of my extended family know I am a lesbian and dating a woman, they know who she is and some even know what company she works for.

The ""controversy"" (as I call it) happened last month, at my cousin's 18th birthday. The 18th is a big deal in my country so a celebration can be even more glamorous than a wedding at times. Because of this, the gifts are usually just as extravagant. My cousin is in his last year of high school and has already been accepted to a university abroad, so Lisa proposed we buy him the Macbook Air 13 M3 that just came out. When I saw the price I said no, but she insisted she'd pay for it because she knows how close I am to my cousin. I eventually accepted and we bought him the laptop.

At the party, nearing the end, my cousin started opening the gifts one by one. Most of them were normal stuff: watches, perfumes, someone of his friends jokingly bought him a blender as well. Then came our gift. He was ecstatic when he saw what we got him, as he was saving money to buy a new laptop and now he was able to use the money for something else. He spent a couple of more minutes on gifts and then almost everyone went back to partying.

My aunt and my uncle came to thank us for the present and even insisted that they pay us back for the laptop as they thought it was too expensive. Lisa assured them that it was alright and they didn't have to give us a single penny back. Not long after that, we left the party and headed back home.

The next day I wake up to tens, if not hundreds, of messages from extended family calling me an asshole for trying to flex my girlfriend's money at my cousin's 18th birthday. Someone asked around the family about Lisa and they got enough information that they found out who she is and how rich she is. From here, it went on to people saying that I am with my girlfriend for money, that I am Lisa's ""personal, private prostitute"" and that this is how I pay for college, and other very hurtful and hateful stuff about us being gay and in a relationship that I would not want to mention.

I called my mom asking what I should say and she recommended I just ignored them. Lisa and my cousin advised me the same thing, but there are some people in my life who I have told about this and they consider that we are assholes because we knew no one else would be able to afford such an expensive gift. Which yeah, is true, but still I don't think that is a reason to say all those mean things to me and even some to my girlfriend.

69,1ckx33y,AITA for reporting a girl to our school for spreading rumors about me?,"I (16M) share a class with Jessica (17F), and our interactions have been anything but smooth. Initially, we connected over our shared interests in music, games, and languages. However, things shifted when I developed feelings for her and anonymously inquired about her relationship status. Learning she wasn't single, we agreed to maintain a friendship, which I genuinely valued.

Despite our agreement, Jessica suddenly blocked me on social media and stopped responding to my messages. Confused and hurt, I tried to reach out several times, only to be met with silence. When she questioned a mutual friend, Bobby (16M), about my absence, Bobby said there was ""beef"" between me and her.

She asked to talk so we unblocked each other, and Jessica explained that she felt overwhelmed by the amount of messages I send to her and my friends in general. Acknowledging her discomfort, I apologized and promised to reduce my texting frequency. In return, Jessica agreed to communicate her feelings more openly.

However, our attempts at reconciliation were short-lived. Jessica once again ghosted me without warning. This time, I decided to move on and began talking to another girl, Sandy (15F). When I casually inquired about Sandy's relationship status, Jessica reacted defensively, which struck me as odd.

It wasn't long before I discovered the unsettling truth: Jessica had been spreading rumors about me, branding me as a ""creep"" based on a vague ""gut feeling."" This baseless accusation led to confrontations from strangers, including a distressing incident during lunch when a group of girls I'd never seen before approached me, hurling insults and accusations.

Because of a school event we were both attending we were forced to discuss our issues, Jessica couldn't provide concrete evidence for her accusations. Instead, she vaguely mentioned my 'obsessive' behavior which she couldn't elaborate on. Moreover, she questioned the authenticity of my past relationship, despite evidence proving otherwise. Despite my efforts to confront her about the rumors, she adamantly denied everything and persisted in spreading falsehoods about me

Feeling unfairly targeted and desperate to clear my name, I reported Jessica's behavior to the school. However, her response was one of denial and defensiveness, despite multiple sources confirming her actions. 

This relentless campaign against me has taken a toll on my mental well-being. I've been labeled a ""snitch"" and an ""asshole"" by Jessica and her circle, further exacerbating the situation as she continues to talk about me. Despite my efforts to resolve the conflict, Jessica remains steadfast in her refusal to acknowledge her wrongdoing.

I'm at a loss for how to proceed. I've been transparent about my intentions and have made genuine efforts to address Jessica's concerns.

So I used to work with this guy who I’ll call Mike. He was my boss and trained me to eventually take is his place which I did, eventually we both left the job and the state but for years I considered him a friend and confidant.

71,1ckw6ng,AITA for kicking my brother’s girlfriend out when she kept screaming at people? ,"My (29F) brother, Cody (25M) and I never had our dad in our lives and our mom passed 3 years ago. We’re really all the family we have left. Currently, we live together, splitting rent on a condo. Cody is dating Shannon (24F). I really like her and we have had no issues until now.
 
Last week, Cody was seriously injured. I’m his emergency contact and was told he was at the hospital. When I arrived, Cody’s boss, Martin was there. Cody and Martin have a great relationship, much better than most bosses and employees, so he was just as worried. And not in a “oh crap, what will this do to the company” but a “I’m really concerned” kind of way. Shannon arrived not long after I got there. Immediately, she began screeching at Martin, asking how he could let this happen, etc. Martin was shocked and said he wasn’t even around when it happened. Cody wasn’t even at the main offices, he got into an accident on his way to a different site. It was in no way the company’s fault. I tried telling Shannon that blaming people wasn’t going to help and we needed to focus on Cody.
 
Eventually, we got to see Cody and thankfully, he was okay for the most part. Shannon was continuing to freak out on medical staff and honestly stressing Cody a lot. Even the nurse told me to take a walk with Shannon because she wasn’t helping things. I did so and told Shannon I understood this was scary but she needed to take a breath. She apologized and said she was stressed. I totally understood.
 
Cody came back to the condo and has been on bed rest. His work has given him paid leave and is covering all of the bills. On Friday afternoon, I was doing the dishes and suddenly heard screaming coming from Cody’s room. I go in there to find Shannon standing by his bed. Cody is on a Zoom call with Martin and a few other higher ups discussing the accident. Shannon is screaming at them that they better not let anything else happen to him, that they’re lucky Cody didn’t sue and that they’re all assholes. Cody looks embarrassed and keeps telling her to stop. Martin says they’ll talk later and ends the call. When I ask what happened, Cody says that he was discussing the company car that was totaled in the accident and when he could expect to get a new one. Shannon interrupted their conversation out of nowhere and flipped out. Cody looked exhausted so I told Shannon to follow me.
 
I asked her to leave. I said she is putting Cody’s job at risk and she can’t go around screaming at everyone. She told me she’s just stressed. I said, I get it. It was terrifying to get that call and see him like that. But Cody doesn’t need everyone screaming, especially at people who have been nothing but nice. She got irritated and said she wasn’t going to go unless Cody asked her. I said it was my condo too and I didn’t want her there. So, she left.
 
Cody isn’t mad at me, but he also says he wouldn’t have cared if she stayed. Shannon, however, is pissed at me and feels I was diminishing her feelings. AITA?

72,1ckvur6,WIBTA for ignoring my neighbor's noise complaints after several attempts to solve the issue.,"Hello! 

I moved recently and my Neighbor is complaining about the sound of  my TV when I watch movies, she says it's making her walls shake.

Since then I have been using a headset all day, every day. The only time I make an exception is when I have friends over which is around 3 or 4 times a month on average. They come at 6pm and we never have sound past 9:30pm

She says even 4 times a month it's still an issue and she suggested I isolate my room (which costs hundreds/thousands to do properly), none of my friends think the volume is too loud. She said it's because I have too much ""bass"" (I do have a good soundbar), so I have started using the crappy TV sound instead to accommodate her, she still said it was too loud despite watching the movie at 6pm with the crappy TV sound.

I asked her for her schedule so I can invite my friends when she's out but she said it's irregular. I moved my whole room around to make the TV as far away as her wall as possible now, while still watching with crappy TV sound and only 4 times a month and she still knocked over last time we watched a movie at reasonable hours.

Would I be the asshole if I stop caring ? I feel I've already went above and beyond trying to accommodate her. It makes me sad because she's quite friendly outside of that. **Edit : Also I just want to point out that she hasn't been mean or rude in any of our interactions.**

Added info : She also complained (to me but not about me) that people close the building door too loud and it makes ""the whole building shakes"".

","My (34m) SIL (35F) has a family media streaming service, which she allows myself and my wife (28F), her parents, and her friend (S) to use. As a result, she has the £110 annual plan, and is asking us to pay half.

I'm against paying half because S has a profile. I don't mind subsidising their parents, because I get on well with them, but SIL claims that the account for S was a present.

I've argued that there is no way I should be subsidising gifts for SIL's friends, and that should be their cost, but SIL says ""I'd benefit from the account even if she didn't have one"" so should ""pay my fair share"".

:Edit to clarify: I'm not refusing to pay at all. I'm more than happy to pay ""my"" fair share - £35 - I object to paying the extra £20 to subsidise a gift to a friend (which was now ""given"" almost two years ago). Apologies for not making that clear initially.

74,1ckvgsb,AITA for telling my brother to get his shit together and actually take a shower?,"
This happened almost two days ago and I’m still conflicted. I (25M) was in a family reunion for my mother’s birthday. I had to pick up my brothers (Richard 26M) and Justin (23M) at their places. I live in a different city and I rarely see them. Growing up Richard and I were very close but lately we rarely speak and he’s been distant. I love my brother but he’s usually very irritated and it’s very hard to establish a civil conversation with him, specially because his life is very difficult atm (no partner, no job, etc)

I picked up Richard and then proceeded to go to Justin’s place, as soon as he got in the car he said “what’s that smell?”. Now I did notice the smell before, but some places in the city smell really bad, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. Richard stayed silent all the ride, didn’t say a single word, it was Justin and I talking the whole time… and that smell… 

After arriving at our parent’s house Justin approached me and asked if I was also sensing that awful smell coming from Richard, I said yes because I suspected it was him. While we were there I noticed that Richard wasn’t talking to anyone and the family members who tried to keep a conversation with him were ignored or he just didn’t seem to bother to maintain any type of conversation with any of us except our mother. Richard and my mom have always been close, and I’m sure he’s my mother’s favorite son, she even cleans his place every other week. But no resentment, she’s a good mother 

One uncle even joked “what’s that smell coming from?” But all of us stayed silent because we knew that would be rude to mention. There was a moment I couldn’t stand it anymore so I took Richard out and told him he smelled. He looked at me with so much shame and told me “I’m sorry.

This happened almost two days ago and I’m still conflicted. I (25M) was in a family reunion for my mother’s birthday. I had to pick up my brothers (Richard 26M) and Justin (23M) at their places. I live in a different city and I rarely see them. Growing up Richard and I were very close but lately we rarely speak and he’s been distant. I love my brother but he’s usually very irritated and it’s very hard to establish a civil conversation with him, specially because his life is very difficult atm (no partner, no job, etc)

I picked up Richard and then proceeded to go to Justin’s place, as soon as he got in the car he said “what’s that smell?”. Now I did notice the smell before, but some places in the city smell really bad, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. Richard stayed silent all the ride, didn’t say a single word, it was Justin and I talking the whole time… and that smell… 

After arriving at our parent’s house Justin approached me and asked if I was also sensing that awful smell coming from Richard, I said yes because I suspected it was him. While we were there I noticed that Richard wasn’t talking to anyone and the family members who tried to keep a conversation with him were ignored or he just didn’t seem to bother to maintain any type of conversation with any of us except our mother. Richard and my mom have always been close, and I’m sure he’s my mother’s favorite son, she even cleans his place every other week. But no resentment, she’s a good mother 

One uncle even joked “what’s that smell coming from?” But all of us stayed silent because we knew that would be rude to mention. There was a moment I couldn’t stand it anymore so I took Richard out and told him he smelled. He looked at me with so much shame and told me “I’m sorry. Didn’t realize I smelled” and I told him “well you do, everyone noticed it” and he then told me not to be an asshole about it. I told him “I’m not an asshole. I know it’s been difficult lately but you need to get your shit together and take a shower if you can’t keep a job”,  he then looked at me really sad, called an Uber and left

76,1ckuo5d,AITA for walking outside in my robe?,"So I (18F) have been sick for the past 2 days with a fever. One second I'm super hot, the next I'm Since my body temperature is all over the place I've been mostly just wearing a robe around the house. 

This morning I still wasn't feeling well and I asked a friend of mine if they could get me some cold and flu medicine since I was out and my parents were at work. They said sure. They were in a rush to get to school so asked if I could meet them outside and just grab the medicine so they wouldn't have to stop their car.

My friend arrived and since I was just laying down recovering I was only in my robe. I figured it'd be fine since it was mid thigh length and I was only going to be outside for a second. So I went outside, got the medicine and my friend left. On my way back inside my neighbour (50F) came outside and started yelling at me. She told me it was disgusting that I was dressed like that outside ""for all to see"" and really started yelling at me. I felt like it wasn't a big deal so I told her that I was outside for less than a minute and this conversation was longer than the time Inwas actually outside for.

She told me I was being disrespectful and then told me to imagine if her husband or someone else was to see me dressed like that. 

Here's where I might be the asshole. I told her that if I had to worry about her husband seeing me when I was still fully covered then she's married to a creep and should have made some better choices on who to marry. 

She gasped loudly and kept yelling at me so I eventually just said I wasn't feeling well and went inside.

Apparently my neighbour ended up talking to my mother when she came back home and she told her what happened. My mother says I was extremely rude and shouldn't have said those things and I have to apologise.

We were told it needs a $6k head gasket repair.  The cars not worth it so we’ve been looking at used cars to replace hers.  She’s going away to college in fall and needs an AWD car.  Our budget is less than $10k and that does get much where we live.  the two most popular models we’ve looked at are Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV.  They’ve all had about 100k miles.  Recently, her grandmother, my MIL, stopped driving and has offered for free a 2008 Buick Enclave AWD with 30k miles.  on one hand, I really want her to have a car she likes.  I think it’s very important for her self confidence going to a new school.  I know personally how this can affect a person.  On the other hand, it seems ridiculous to buy a car w 100k miles instead of just using one with 30k miles.  If we bought a new used car, we would be able to sell the Buick to pay for it.  My daughter will be very upset if I change the plan now and tell her she has to drive the Buick, which she views as a soccer mom car.  So WIBTA if I changed my mind and made her drive the Buick as a better investment?

Edit to clarify: The initial cost is the same.  Either she gets Gmas car and we don’t spend any money or we get what she wants for ~$10k and sell Gmas car to replenish the funds.

79,1cktz9e,AITA for going out every Saturday and doing my chores on Sunday?,"Hi there, I’m kind of debating as to whether I’m the asshole for this one. I (20F) moved back in with my parents for two reasons. The first is to help my dad who experienced a stroke in 2022, he had a stroke in my apartment and I had to wait my lease out until I could go back home. My mom asked me to come home to help until I go to university. The second is to save up for university. 

For context, I work a full time job from Monday to Friday. I spend my Friday night staying at my partner’s place and on Saturday morning, he and I go around town to be productive. I guess Saturday tends to be my get shit done day? I have a lot to do during Saturday mornings because I work 9-5:30s, it’s difficult for me to get appointments or get things done when most things in my town (i.e., hospitals, banks, etc) open at 9 and close at 5. When I get home, I normally start doing my chores on Saturday night. I have DnD from 8:30pm - 11:30pm and anything I can’t finish, I get it done on the Sunday. 

The issue here is that I tend to save the bathroom for the last. Because my dad is wheelchair bound, he tends to wander in throughout the day and his wheelchair wheels dirty up the floor if I mop and stuff. I tend to save the bathroom at night where he’s sleeping and I can clean it without worrying of mopping again. My mom and I argue all the time about the bathroom because she thinks I save it for last because I’m lazy when that just isn’t the case. I’ve tried explaining it to her but she just calls me lazy and useless.

I woke up a little early today so I could get started on the chores. I walked out and my mom was immediately asking me to do a bunch of stuff and I was still waking up. My mom wakes up really early because she likes to workout from 5-6:45ish in the morning. I told her “it’s still 7am, could I wake up a little before I start doing things?” and she gets really mad. She tells me it’s my fault because I always go out on Saturdays and I save the bathroom for last. I told her that I was going to do it but if she yells at me all the time, it makes me not want to do it at all. She calls me lazy and tells me I’m always out like some whore on the weekends. In my culture, it’s frowned upon to stay at your partner’s house if you’re not married. 

I just retreat to my room and now, I’m here writing this post.

All that said though, I have to ask, am I the asshole? Was not inviting my wife a bad call? I have to plead genuine ignorance on this one. ",0.0,1.0546952486038208,1,0
82,1ckt1p8,AITA for telling my girlfriend she’s not great at pickleball and she should sit out games?,"I (24M) recently started playing pickleball after finishing college as a hobby, and I’ve been playing it for a while. I’ve also been playing tennis since I was a kid so a lot of the skills transferred, and after getting accustomed to the swing and weight of the ball and paddle, I just play games very competitively and comfortably.

After my gf (23F), saw that I frequently went to games and made friends this way, wanted to join, and I obliged because of course I want us to spend time together with our hobbies. So I bring her over to my games and we start playing. I knew she was a beginner, but she can’t swing properly, either misses the ball or hits it out if the court, or react fast enough to move into a better position just to swing, or reach the ball on the far side of the court. Many times she hits it too high or low. Sometimes she just freezes if the ball comes straight at her too.

All that’s fine, she’s a beginner. As you’d expect, the people in the game (myself included), drop down a few skill levels and accommodate her, and help her practice by making it easier, changing our expected game flow and speed we usually play at. We enjoyed our time and people were nice and wanted to see us again, and we do meet them in other events.

After we went home I was reached out by an individual asking if we could visit practice sessions for pickleball, and I knew what he was alluding to and I agreed with his opinion. My gf wasn’t good enough to play pickleball yet. Our games were disrupted because of her skill level, and it just became boring. So I explain this to her in the most sincere way, and say how she can’t properly handle a normal game yet and she should practice (and I’m offering to help her), and she agrees.

But here’s where it gets troublesome. She never goes to practice on her own time (she says it’s too expensive or she doesn’t have time), and never plans or books courts for when I’m available to help her. As soon as I say I’m going to play pickleball, she asks to come play and is annoyed when I say that she’s not good enough. I ask her why hasn’t she practiced? She then responds by saying let’s go an hour before to practice and we’d be fine. I disagree, and find it incredibly annoying that she doesn’t understand that an hours worth of playing at her skill level will not be enough.

She says that I’m controlling and want a sense of power when in reality it’s one simple thing: She’s bad at the game and it’s not fun to play with her.

I’m at a crossroads with this, because I want to play with friends and she wants to come along but I feel bad telling her she should just sit out and not play, and would feel more offended if I told her not to come at all, but if I let her play, myself and others would not be enjoying the game as much at all.

Am I the asshole for asking her to sit out games with friends and meetups for not making it into a practice session?

83,1ckt0dq,WIBTA if I asked my partner to contribute to housing costs?,"I, 28M, have been with my partner, 23M, for over two years. He lives at home rent free and has a stable professional job. He typically stays at my place three nights per week and has had a key since late 2022.

I'm moving to a new place soon and am thinking about asking him to make a slight contribution, say £200 - £250 per month, to the housing costs in consideration of the time he spends here and the usage of utilities etc. I also wash his clothes a lot if he leaves dirty ones in the basket. I don't mind doing this.

Would this be appropriate? I can't see him taking it very well. We have talked about moving in together but he doesn't want to move in with me to a rented place because he sees renting as dead money. He's talking about buying a house but hasn't moved on this yet.

Meanwhile, I don't want to move my whole life in to his house if he buys one, only to find out we're not compatible living together full time. I also don't want to buy a place with him until we've spent a period of time living together.

Edit: He is a good person and does help me a lot. He looks after my pets while I'm away, for example. Was recently away for two weeks and he stayed over to take care of them.

(25f) told her off","I have three roommates. Dan, 24m, has a guest Erin 25f staying over Thurs-tues. Dan, Pat 26m (RM) and Erin are college friends. Us four went for dinner and drinks on Fri. It was a good night overall and this was the first time I met Erin. 

On the car ride home, 2am, Erin said ""here's my read of people. Grace (that's me), you're an instigator and you pick fights. Dan, you say things sometimes that grace doesn't like so she picks fights with you. Pat, you're calm and have opinions you keep to yourself"".

Pat and Dan both started laughing and agreeing with her. I said I don't agree. I can expand on this but it's just not 100% accurate. The four of us went back and forth, and Erin doubled down with Dan and Pat adding on Finally, I said ""look, Erin, you have four more days in our house, so..."" And I thought the implication was "" let's not stir the pot"". I did not yell or raise my voice. My tone was definitely irritated but I did not attack her personally at all.

Erin immediately got very sad, said she has autism so she can't read social cues. She said she was just joking and can find a hotel. I said you don't need a hotel, but let it go. Dan started apologizing saying ""grace doesn't handle criticism well"". I said, my response wasn't that bad. Dan said ""it only would have been worse if you shot her; I'm apologizing for you because I know you won't"". Erin continued to look dejected in the living room with Pat consoling her. 

After, I asked Dan if he was mad at me. He said obviously because I was a dick to his guest, I overreacted and lost my shit, I should have given her the benefit of the doubt, she was just joking, I ""lashed out and proved her point that I'm an aggressor"". I said I don't agree and here's where I'm losing my mind. Erin criticized me unprompted. I responded with annoyance?  How am I the instigator here? It was 2am and we all had drinks.

He said I basically told her to leave. I said that wasn't my intention at all but he said nobody took it that way. I literally didn't say anything about her leaving.

Anyways, Erin came in after, I said I'm sorry what I said came out different than I intended, I meant to say we shouldn't stir the pot, etc. she apologized too and we all made up.

Regardless, Dan is still treating me like the problem and excluded me from our lunch plans. When I asked he said ""I'm not sure if you're actually regretful, and we won't be good until I'm convinced you're truly sorry so it won't happen again"". I'm pissed off about the double standard.

85,1cksyc0,AITA for stealing my parents car ,"Hey, I'm pretty new to reddit, and I basically made this account just so I could post here because heard about this page from a lot of family and friends. Well here's my story:

  
I (23F) am doing fantastic financially, I am a drop shipper (believe it or it actually works lol) and I just recently came across a bunch of business because my product went viral. Everything was good and all, I made insane money and thought it was only right I treat myself and my parents for always being there to support me even tho they have been quite harsh at times and made it obvious that I am not their favorite child (keep that piece of info in ur mind bc its related). 

I thought what better way to say thanks than to buy them a car, and also buy myself a car while I'm at it, and so I did, I got 2 Mercedes Benz EQs (both of them were still registered under my name). One for me, and the other for my parents. I surprised them with it and everything went great, until my sister (18F) got super jealous of the fact that I had made money and have my dream car. She threw a fit and demanded one too. She is our parents' favorite child that I was talking about. My parents tried their best to calm her down but she wouldn't listen to a word. And this is pretty normal in our family so I didnt really think much of it UNTIL

One morning I woke up to my car keys missing? and I instantly knew that the one person that could have took it was my sister, and sure enough it WAS my sister who took it. I called her up a million times but she wouldnt pick up her calls, I got fed up and went to my parents about it and shockingly enough they knew that she had taken the car and had allowed her to take **MY** car **WITHOUT** my permission. I was furious, and threw a fit at my parents too for letting that happen. I swore that if she came back with one tiny scratch on the car I would absolutely call the cops and make her pay for it. 

And I know this wont sound real, but you know the one thing that she did? She ended up rear ending a Honda Civic at **1 AM**. I was pissed when I heard about it the next morning and when I asked to see the car, my parents said that it is still pulled over at the crash site and that **I** would have to pay for the towing fee and also getting my car fixed up. When I tried scolding my sister my parents had stopped me and had called me a bad older sister for lashing at her. I mentioned how she was always their favorite and they never took my side on anything no matter how right or wrong I was, then they proceeded to call my **ungrateful**. I had enough of their drama and decided its best for me to just let the cops handle it. I ended up lashing out at my parents too and called the cops, packed my bags and basically stole the car that I had gifted to them bc they didn't deserve, Im now at a friends place they keep calling and texting me saying to drop the charges and also said that they want **THEIR** car back.

88,1cksomo,AITA for playing a multiplayer video game while taking care of my grandmother,"For context my grandmother had COPD and was in hospice and I was 22, she was staying with me and I was helping take care of her, feeding her, changing her bedpan, and giving her breathing treatments at the appropriate times. We also had health care workers during the day while I was working so she was never alone. She did not have much time left (doctor told us 6 months but she passed a few weeks later.)

Here is what happened, I gave her dinner and medication she fell asleep watching TV, I always had my phone with me on loud in case she needed me she would just call.

After I was sure she was asleep, I went only one room away to my laptop to play a game of heroes of the storm (a multiplayer moba) I played a quick match game which does not affect your rank anything, it's the best game mode to learn how to play characters you don't know how to play to well, but obviously people still like to win.

A few minutes into the game my grandmother called me to get her some more water and change out her pot (would change after Everytime she went to avoid odor) and I obviously left my computer to help her.

After she was tucked in again, I went back to my computer and apologized to my teammates as they were understandably frustrated that I was afk for a few minutes.

I told them ""hey I'm sorry Grandma is in hospice and she needed me to help her real quick"" and they tore me a new one and insulted my grandmother and made fun of me and called me a piece of shit for playing video games and said things like ""boohoo nobody cares""

I then posted in the games reddit telling the community that I thought it was rather cruel and to be nicer to people.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-05,"AITA for playing a multiplayer video game while taking care of my grandmother For context my grandmother had COPD and was in hospice and I was 22, she was staying with me and I was helping take care of her, feeding her, changing her bedpan, and giving her breathing treatments at the appropriate times. We also had health care workers during the day while I was working so she was never alone. She did not have much time left (doctor told us 6 months but she passed a few weeks later.)

Here is what happened, I gave her dinner and medication she fell asleep watching TV, I always had my phone with me on loud in case she needed me she would just call.

After I was sure she was asleep, I went only one room away to my laptop to play a game of heroes of the storm (a multiplayer moba) I played a quick match game which does not affect your rank anything, it's the best game mode to learn how to play characters you don't know how to play to well, but obviously people still like to win.

A few minutes into the game my grandmother called me to get her some more water and change out her pot (would change after Everytime she went to avoid odor) and I obviously left my computer to help her.

After she was tucked in again, I went back to my computer and apologized to my teammates as they were understandably frustrated that I was afk for a few minutes.

I told them ""hey I'm sorry Grandma is in hospice and she needed me to help her real quick"" and they tore me a new one and insulted my grandmother and made fun of me and called me a piece of shit for playing video games and said things like ""boohoo nobody cares""

I then posted in the games reddit telling the community that I thought it was rather cruel and to be nicer to people.

My mom had a very visceral reaction when she learned the name. I (17f) was home with her when the text came through and she went on a talking to herself rant about it.

He was shocked because mom never talks to us like that and she's generally a really easy going to excitable person.

I tried not to bring it up but mom has vented to me about how much she hates the name. She even made a comment to my brother about it and he told her to deal with the dislike because Wren's name isn't changing.

It was a week ago when mom confessed why the name bothered her so much. She said she had some trauma related to family members who all had nature names and animal names more specifically and it felt like a curse or a bad omen to use the name. I let mom talk and she didn't give a lot of specifics but I can see why she might have some fear about it and I guess that fear comes out as disgust and anger.

I told mom I was sorry for what had happened and suggested she work through that in therapy because Wren's name isn't changing and doesn't she wanted to enjoy her granddaughter without all this fear inside of her that bubbles over into anger.

93,1ckrcnf,AITA for telling my mother that she needs to watch how she speaks to people even though she is the provider? ,"So I (M18) live with my mother (F36) and my younger brother, let's call him Fred. Fred has a lot of little anxieties that we have noticed over the years of things that most people would see as irrelevant. Me and my mother have OCD so we were wondering if maybe there was something similar going in Fred's situation. He's in 2nd grade, so quite young.

So my mother works as a manager for a child care centre out near where we live. Child cares here sometimes get these little pets if the manager agrees to take care of it after work hours. So a few days ago she came home with this small body and white budgie bird, and Fred has absolutely fallen in love with it. Now that the weekend is over, and the bird is returning to the centre (But coming back every night) Fred is anxious that the kids will be too excited and reckless and accidentally harm the bird. 

Now for some reason, whenever my mother comes home from anything that's stressful or tiring, she comes home EXTREMELY stern and blunt. And sometimes its just far too much. Today she came home and went off at me for all of the chores I apparently didn't to yo a satisfactory level, I apologised and made sure to do them to a proper level. But when she went into the room with Fred, Fred said to her ""Mum I don't want snowy to go"". Snowy is the name of the budgie, for context. And mums response was ""Well it's their bird to!"" And shrugged before walking off. I didn't think that was okay. 

I walked up and said ""Hey, you can't say that to the kid"".... And she immediately goes off. Talking about how I'm in no position to lecture her, and that I'm the child and she's the mother and it's her house so she'll say whatever she so pleases. We argued back and forth and I essentially told her that just because she is the provider, doesn't mean that she doesn't have to respect the other people who live with her and that she needed to stop being an arsehole. She has now essentially said that if I'm some kind of man who can 'puff his chest out' and 'tell her what's what' then it's time I move out cause she isn't going to change that behaviour. She also refuses to admit that her saying that to Fred is dismissive of the kids feelings, and just quite disrespectful.

A while later, we were talking about my party and one of the guys to my face said that they would just wanna come to pregame bc the beer was free, and then they would go to a different party. I felt so used and uncomfortable; at the time i laughed it off.

The day of the party, i say in our groupchat “if you are just trying to come here to pregame, don’t.” the message was read by everyone. The guy who made the initial comment about that texted me privately saying he was sorry and that he knows his comment was rude, that i have a right to be mad, and that he was “just joking”. 

about 4 hours later, they all show up to the party even though i told them NOT to come if they were just gonna use me for free shit. I told them to leave, and for a while they refused until my other roommates came to the door and then they finally left.

hours later, one of the guys texted me that “no one ever liked me to begin with”. i posted that in the chat and blew up at everyone (swore a lot) as i was drunk and so hurt. they are all saying that i’m the problem bc i didn’t let them in even though i told them not to come if tyey were just gonna use me for the free alcohol… if u wanted to come and stay, i totally understand. or, if u wanted to go to my party first and brought something and then left after a while,and clarified that w me beforehand, i would also get it. but i feel used.

97,1ckqkff,AITA for calling my parents unfair in front of extended family?,"My parents have me (16m) and they have my three younger siblings (12f, 10m and 9f). I don't feel like my parents are totally fair to me and I have said this to them before. When I was 5 I had chores. Small ones. But still, I had chores. It started with picking up after myself and bringing my dishes to whoever's washing up. It grew into vacuuming and setting the table and grew again into washing dishes dishes, taking out the trash and being in charge of keeping upstairs clean.

My younger siblings have no chores and never had chores. My parents only give me chores. My siblings never even got the baby ones I started out with. I was typically expected to do it for them or my parents just did it.

Two years ago I was really bothered by it and I told my parents I wish they split things more between us instead of giving my siblings no chores and me a bunch of them. They argued that I get more privileges than them because of it but I don't. We all get to go to friends houses, they get given money far more than I do, and they get treats way more often too. I was told I was at an age where I didn't need to be given treats as much.

I brought it up again a few months later and my mom told me I should stop bringing it up because I was acting like an elementary schooler instead of a high schooler.

Last time I brought it up to just them I pointed out how often they have me pick up after my siblings and stuff. They told me it helps teach me to care for my siblings and as the oldest shows me the responsibility I have with them. Dad said it built character. I told them it really didn't make me want to do stuff for them more. I actually resented taking care of them and seeing them do nothing for themselves or for me in return.

It really started to annoy the crap out of me lately because my parents have been on my case about leaving chores longer and not doing as good of a job. They told me I grumble more at my siblings too and it's not kind. So when we were at a family BBQ last weekend I brought up again how unfair they are to me in giving me chores but not my siblings. My parents were furious I used the extended family to try and get my way and they punished me for like 5 days.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-05,"AITA for calling my parents unfair in front of extended family? My parents have me (16m) and they have my three younger siblings (12f, 10m and 9f). I don't feel like my parents are totally fair to me and I have said this to them before. When I was 5 I had chores. Small ones. But still, I had chores. It started with picking up after myself and bringing my dishes to whoever's washing up. It grew into vacuuming and setting the table and grew again into washing dishes dishes, taking out the trash and being in charge of keeping upstairs clean.

My younger siblings have no chores and never had chores. My parents only give me chores. My siblings never even got the baby ones I started out with. I was typically expected to do it for them or my parents just did it.

Two years ago I was really bothered by it and I told my parents I wish they split things more between us instead of giving my siblings no chores and me a bunch of them. They argued that I get more privileges than them because of it but I don't. We all get to go to friends houses, they get given money far more than I do, and they get treats way more often too. I was told I was at an age where I didn't need to be given treats as much.

I brought it up again a few months later and my mom told me I should stop bringing it up because I was acting like an elementary schooler instead of a high schooler.

Last time I brought it up to just them I pointed out how often they have me pick up after my siblings and stuff. They told me it helps teach me to care for my siblings and as the oldest shows me the responsibility I have with them. Dad said it built character. I told them it really didn't make me want to do stuff for them more. I actually resented taking care of them and seeing them do nothing for themselves or for me in return.

It really started to annoy the crap out of me lately because my parents have been on my case about leaving chores longer and not doing as good of a job. They told me I grumble more at my siblings too and it's not kind. So when we were at a family BBQ last weekend I brought up again how unfair they are to me in giving me chores but not my siblings.

98,1ckqd65,AITA for not wanting giving my dog back?,"For context: my parents are divorced, I live in Germany with my mom (54), brother (18) and sister (13). My dad (52), stepmom (43), stepsister (18) and half-brother (3) moved to the States in october 2023. We have 3 dogs Boots (f10), Denki (m3) and Grace (f1). Grace is the daughter of our two other dogs. We were selling the (3) puppys becauase my mom didn´t have the money for three dogs and we sold Grace to my dad for 1100€ (they paid 850€ before moving and haven´t paid the rest yet).

When they moved they asked my mom to take Grace temporarily (2 or 3 months) because they flew to Cali to visit my nana and tata for a week and then flew to NC to look for work and a place to live and they didn´t want to take her on a 18 hour trip. She agreed because like I said, she thought it was temporary.

Fast forward to now; my stepsister moved back to Germany and lives with her grandma for now until she and my other stepsister (23) find an appartment together. My mom and stepmom texted about Grace yesterday. My stepmom said that Grace still belongs to them because they paid for her and my mom said that it´s been 8 months and that she isn´t a stuffed animal you can just ignore that long and then take her back, to which my stepmom said that if they had the money Grace would already be with them. She is scared of almost everything and it took her some time to settle at our place again after being with my dad for 3 months. He texted my mom after that and said that my stepsisters would get Grace once they found an appartment in a bit.

Now to be honest I don´t think they treated her good. They didn´t abuse her but they neglegted her a bit. When she was little we had puppy pads for them to pee and shit on until they were old enough to be housetrained. They never taught her that or other things like sit either. They gave her the wrong food so she was lacking nutrients and other stuff that is in puppy food. They also didn´t play with her or pet her enough either. Her life with us is much better and she is also never alone (because of our other dogs) when we are at work/school, which she will be if she lives with my stepsisters because the younger one is starting an apprenticeship and the other one is working full time.

In Regensburg the appartments aren´t exactly cheap because it´s a bigger city (population of around 160.000) and they won´t have a garden like we have because we own a house so the HAVE to go on a walk with her everytime she has to pee or shit. We do too but at night for example, we can just let them out in the garden. There aren´t a lot of apartments that allow dogs and they can afford so it´s gonna take a while to even find one. None of us want to give Grace to them because of those reasons and also they would be overwhelmed with her after like two weeks because they never had a pet on their own.

99,1ckq5ev,AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to travel alone or with a friend?,"Dear community, I (31m) have been with my girlfriend (26f) for over a year and a few months. We currently live together in a major German city, and overall, I would describe our relationship as really great, loving, and caring.

In the beginning, we were both troubled by alcoholism, which we overcame together. After lots of issues (like loss of control, amnesia and almost cheating on her side and bad reactions to these actions from my side), we mutually decided to stop drinking to save ourselves and our relationship.

Yesterday, I had an argument with her when she brought up the topic of travelling abroad alone or with a younger female friend who drinks. My girlfriend hasn’t really travelled a lot and seems to be a bit naive.

I told her that I highly disliked the idea because of the potential dangers for her/them. I think it’s important to note here that my girlfriend recently started to drink alcohol again, just a little, one-to-two beers when we have a barbecue or when she’s playing video games—never to the point of being drunk or so. I don’t have a problem with that, and I do trust her that she doesn’t want to go back to the old heavy drinking habit.

I don’t mind her going out around where we live because I could always pick her up if she would need some support, would feel bad, be a little drunk, or if it would be really late, so she doesn’t have to walk around alone at night or take public transportation. (Our city can be quite dangerous, especially at night.)

She doesn’t understand that I’m against the idea because I’ve seen and been through a lot, travelled to many places, and know a thing or two about how (unfortunately) many men out there are exactly after solo girls (especially those who are slightly intoxicated and therefore an “easy target”) for all types of exploitation, harassment, and so on.

I would not mind her or them travelling together with another male friend; just the idea of two young women, one of whom is the love of my life, alone in another country is really bothering me. I don’t think that my girlfriend is irresponsible, and I don’t believe that she would get super wasted, cheat on me, flirt with other men, or whatever. It’s more like a bad gut feeling about this because I could not potentially help her or her friend if they found themselves in a dangerous situation. I also don’t know her friend so well, especially not her drinking behaviour, and I know how easily peer pressure can force people to ingest more alcoholic beverages than they initially intended to. Also, there is the risk that she/they might get their drinks spiked, which is unfortunately not uncommon.

So AITA is opposing her travel plans because of my safety concerns? She doesn’t understand that it’s not that I don’t trust her, I simply don’t trust others.

My parents were in a ""transitional period"" as my moms parents called it in the weeks prior to his death. What I think that means is they were trying to figure out how to divorce without fucking me up. But I thought it was pretty clear my parents relationship was done. They hadn't seemed happy in so long and I don't remember them being affectionate with each other.

Within a year of my dad dying my mom met ""Harvey"" and they were dating for two years when she introduced me and him. He seemed okay. I wasn't like OMG so excited to have my mom dating someone. But it was fine. Mom asked me what I thought and I told her he seemed okay and she was really happy which was nice. She asked me if I thought he'd make a good bonus dad and I told her I hated how that sounded. We talked and she admitted she wanted to pick someone I could see being the new father figure in my life. She said it didn't have to be an only dad thing but even if I loved someone enough to think of them as a second dad. I told her that wouldn't happen but I'd be fine with Harvey sticking around and being married to her if she wanted that. We went to therapy and Harvey eventually joined us and by the time we were done I was almost 15 and they were married and mom was pregnant.

My mom had two kids in the last 18 months. My half brother is 17 months old and my half sister is 3 months old. Things were kind of crazy when my half brother was born so mom didn't do any kind of party or celebration of his birth. Since she and Harvey made sure they won't have more kids mom decided to throw a party to celebrate the kids being born.

So this is where I should say that I'm pretty indifferent to the babies. I know they're technically my half siblings. But I don't really feel anything toward them. Honestly it makes me sad that I was the only kid my parents had together because I think it would have been nice to have someone who's been there with me through my parents relationship breaking down, dad dying and mom remarrying and starting a family with Harvey. But I just don't see my half siblings the way I imagine seeing a full sibling, because we only share one parent, because I'm so much older and because our experiences will always be so different. I don't hate them. But I can't honestly say I love them.

During the party for the babies I got kind of tired of faking being happy and enthusiastic about it so I went upstairs for a while and was talking to my best friend.

Both Lane and I got pregnant the same year, and our kids are now 2. After having kids, Lane and I didn’t have much in common any more. Her interests completely revolved around motherhood, every activity has to be child focused or at least child friendly, and while I totally respect that, it wasn’t how I wanted to live my life. She also became kind of disparaging about a lot of things I did, especially soon after birth. Eventually I just stopped offering to change every plan to suit her, and said no to things that I didn’t want to do, so we just gradually stopped hanging out.

So I’ve been together with my bf for about one year. We both live in a big city in a country we are both not from, so our respective families are in two different countries. 
He travels a lot for work and is mostly away at weekends and sometimes for weeks He also has business in his country of origin so he’s also there often.

I always invited him to our activities (we saw several friends and did touristy things etc.) but he only joined on one day.

I told him I felt a responsibility to be with my sister as she doesn’t speak the local language and is not very accustomed to moving in the city alone. 
I also didn’t mention that we both have an infection atm that we are both curing and are being abstinent from sex so we could not have “slept” together anyway, even though of course it would have been nice to just spend the night together. However I am still feeling fearful of contacts as we have to still abstain for another week (and I am the only one with symptoms). But it was logistically impossible since atm he’s staying at a place very far from my place and my job (where me and my sister were both working, her remotely of course) and I would have had to leave my sister alone which I didn’t want to.
He’s feeling resentful saying we could have at least spent a couple hrs together or at least one night. Thing is we had planned to have dinners the three of us together etc, but he cancelled every time. I guess having dinner all together and then dropping my sis home and spending some alone time together would have been possible but he didn’t bother seeing us apart from that one day and I think he did it mostly just to be corteous to my sister and meet her properly (I already met his whole family).

Bri and I have both shared how our moms have pushed us at a young age to lose weight and how its affected our relationship with working out and eating. 

I do want to lose weight, but my main focus is just to eat better and feel better.

107,1ckn8cw,AITA - My mother-in-law is charging my husband and I more rent because she needs the money,"Three years ago my mother-in-law bought a home that was a 1031 exchange. We mutually agreed that the home she purchased my husband and I would live in and pay the mortgage. The house was a huge fixer upper from the 1960’s that needed a full renovation. While the bathrooms still haven’t been completed about 80% of the work has been completed and we’ve personally spent about $50k in renovations and are anticipating to spend another $20k to $30k. The house has made about $100m in equity

Our goal was to live in this house for at least five years and after that we talked about selling it and doing another 1031 exchange into a larger house. Here’s where the plans shifted. 

About 2 years ago she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. While we all hope her cancer will be in a place of “maintenance” she has  declined dramatically. She has now moved into a phrase where she needs a caregiver almost full time to function, and the cancer has spread to multiple organs.

Here’s where I’m having trouble… yesterday she calls my husband telling him that next month we need to start paying an additional $500 a month and then in a few months after that $1000 more. Mind you we pay the entire mortgage so this extra income would be going straight to her. 

The house we live in could fetch an extra $500 a month, if renovations were complete and they’re aren’t. 

I guess I’m infuriated because she wouldn’t tell my husband why we needed to pay this money right away and she expected it. I think about my parents and they would never charge a dime more on the mortgage if they were in this situation. Granted, this is not the situation, but adding $500/$1,000 more a month is significant. I just don’t have those funds laying around. My husband was mortified about the phone call and honestly taken back that his mother suggested it. We can only come up with the reason she needs this money is because she’s hired a caregiver and would be running through her retirement fund at an expedited pace.

While I’m more than happy to help my mother-in-law pay medical bills, I’m baffled by this stark request which she is making. Obviously my emotions are high, but I’m starting to resent her and that why I need more opinions to see it in a different light. 

My husband did phrase it to look at it from an alternative view that we would inherit the house no matter what, and that we have to do this because his mother needs the help.

Update: The house is in a trust. She also owns a mobile home and has two children (my husband and his brother) but in the trust everything is written as 50/50.

AITA for telling him, no, don’t agree to the $500/$1,000 we need to have a further conversation of the reasoning and a concrete date that we all mutually agree on and negotiate the number?

Elie is participating in an exchange program called ""Erasmus"" in my country, which typically spans six months and involves living in a different country to enhance one's market value. However, we've encountered some difficulties in our relationship lately, and while I'm starting to think I might be overreacting, I can't shake this unsettling feeling.  
It all began when Elie started spending a lot of time with a group called ""the Frenchies,"" consisting of three guys and three girls. They've been making new friends. However, things have become awkward recently; our conversations have become less frequent, with no phone calls, and I feel a sense of distance between us. I can't help the feeling that either she's met someone else there (which she won't disclose), or she's undergoing significant personal changes, leaving me puzzled. We had a phone call a few days ago where I poured out my feelings, expressing my concerns that I've noticed her changing day by day. She denied it, claiming she's simply ""figured out who she is"" and that all her efforts to change were for me, to please me.

As I told her, if she asked me to remove any woman from my social media, I would do it without hesitation or complaint.   
\- I expressed discomfort about her going to the beach with boys for parties, coming home late, and going to clubs. I'm uncomfortable because I don't know the guys she's going with, and I consider it inappropriate.  
 \- She's been speaking differently than she used to with me. When I asked her about it, she said she used to mimic my way of speaking when we hung out, implying that I was the one who influenced her to ""speak better.""

110,1ckm5dv,AITA for asking my friends for help getting money back from one of our old friends/roommates?,"Sorry if this is really long but i don’t want to leave anything out.

This is going to be a hard situation to explain so i’m going to try my best and if there is anything that needs clarification i’m happy to give the elaboration needed.

So in February of 2023, my roommate and who i considered my close friend (i’ll call him Mark) lost his job. he was working for my family business but he wasn’t very good at his job but since he was my best friend my family gave him 3 months notice to find new work. While we were both working for them i would also give him an hours ride to work every shift since we worked the same hours. 

During the 3 months notice and the few months following, Mark only would apply for 1 job a week (i never even saw these applications because it’s none of my business) and would sit at home and play video games all day. 

During this time, our other roommate was helping with his rent and i was feeding him and helping him come out with our friend group as he has had problems with mental health in the past. if it was for any other person i would have just kicked them out.

We tracked these expenses using an app called split wise because he told us he doesn’t like being in debt so he would know how much he needed to pay back once he went back to work.

we moved out in August and after the keys were handed in and we were moving back to our parents places he completely cut off contact with myself and the roommate. 

His total debt accumulated to $10,750. an ungodly amount that we were even happy for him to pay back with $200 a week each since he was back living with his parents and earning $2000 a month.

I’ve recently had a falling out with my father and he fired me aswell. so while i’ve been looking for work i thought i would chase up some of that money since he was talking to one of our friends saying he’s earning tons of money and recently bought a new car. 

after multiple attempts to get the money back from him, we got an email that we were receiving the bond back in full from our apartment. since we hadn’t seen any money yet i messaged Mark to ask him if the two people he owed money to could split the bond 50/50 to make a dent into the debt. In order for that to happen he had to sign off on a document to say he agrees to the split. He became aggressive saying we were trying to steal his money even though if he didn’t agree to the document it would have been split between the 3 of us.

since i am unable to get this money i have decided to ask my friends for help and advice to get this money back.

he has now cracked a fit at our friends saying i’m turning them against him and if i wanted some money i should have just asked. but i have attempted multiple times before and i don’t believe it’s my problem to message him every week.

My friends have organised a hangout/intervention by their own volition however they are nervous he will think it was my orchestration.

looking for advice and validation i guess as to what to do.",TL;DR,2024-05-05,"AITA for asking my friends for help getting money back from one of our old friends/roommates? Sorry if this is really long but i don’t want to leave anything out.

This is going to be a hard situation to explain so i’m going to try my best and if there is anything that needs clarification i’m happy to give the elaboration needed.

So in February of 2023, my roommate and who i considered my close friend (i’ll call him Mark) lost his job. he was working for my family business but he wasn’t very good at his job but since he was my best friend my family gave him 3 months notice to find new work. While we were both working for them i would also give him an hours ride to work every shift since we worked the same hours. 

During the 3 months notice and the few months following, Mark only would apply for 1 job a week (i never even saw these applications because it’s none of my business) and would sit at home and play video games all day. 

During this time, our other roommate was helping with his rent and i was feeding him and helping him come out with our friend group as he has had problems with mental health in the past. if it was for any other person i would have just kicked them out.

We tracked these expenses using an app called split wise because he told us he doesn’t like being in debt so he would know how much he needed to pay back once he went back to work.

we moved out in August and after the keys were handed in and we were moving back to our parents places he completely cut off contact with myself and the roommate. 

His total debt accumulated to $10,750. an ungodly amount that we were even happy for him to pay back with $200 a week each since he was back living with his parents and earning $2000 a month.

I’ve recently had a falling out with my father and he fired me aswell. so while i’ve been looking for work i thought i would chase up some of that money since he was talking to one of our friends saying he’s earning tons of money and recently bought a new car. 

after multiple attempts to get the money back from him, we got an email that we were receiving the bond back in full from our apartment. since we hadn’t seen any money yet i messaged Mark to ask him if the two people he owed money to could split the bond 50/50 to make a dent into the debt. In order for that to happen he had to sign off on a document to say he agrees to the split. He became aggressive saying we were trying to steal his money even though if he didn’t agree to the document it would have been split between the 3 of us.

since i am unable to get this money i have decided to ask my friends for help and advice to get this money back.

he has now cracked a fit at our friends saying i’m turning them against him and if i wanted some money i should have just asked. but i have attempted multiple times before and i don’t believe it’s my problem to message him every week.

111,1cklyfg,AITAH for stealing my sibling's idea?,"My sibling (NB20) and I (F21) were discussing TV shows from our childhood. We both enjoy drawing and they had the idea to draw one of the characters from those shows as a human.

I didn't wait, because I had inspiration at 1am and I wanted to use it before art block hit.

Now my sibling is annoyed at me and says that ""there's no point in drawing [their] interpretation now"". I think they're just being petty over this, it's not my fault that I got round to drawing the idea first, but I feel a little bad because I knew they really wanted to draw it first.

112,1ckly7v,AITA for wanting to get my niece a ring when my mom also got her a ring?,"I'm the type of person that gets people exactly what they want (if I can afford it) I save from my social security sometimes for gifts if someone talks a lot about a gift they want, so getting a certain gift feels extra special because I saved for it. I'm not sure if that makes sense? My niece told me for her high school graduation present, she wants a ring so my friend told me about pandora, they have retired sales where the jewelry is expensive and good quality (according to my friend) but marked down. My mom absolutely lost it on me, when I said I'm getting my niece a ring too because my niece told me ""I want a lot of rings"" I don't know if this is a neurodivergent thing, but I take things very literally. I don't like diverting from what someone wants/needs. My mom asked ""why are you getting her the same thing I am?"" I replied ""Its not the same stones etc, its very different"" And I shared the link to the ring and she said ""looks cheap, waste of money."" ""Its plated"" ""youre going to upset your niece because shes very picky""

I stopped messaging my mom and cried, feeling likr an absolute failure of an aunt. I asked my niece's mom (my sister) of it would be ok for this ring to be gifted and she said ""your niece would love a turd with glitter on it, shes humble and would be grateful""

I replied with ""Yeah but does plated cause green fingers? I dont want to get her something cheap""

I ended up buying her real gold, fresh water pearl earrings for 48 dollars. They were originally 200 and I feel dumb because I hastily did it while feeling overwhelmed and guilty. After buying it, I see the reviews and a lot are bad. So now she'll probably have broken earrings proving my mom was right about me getting cheap gifts.

113,1cklvtb,AITA (27F) for not wanting to buy a car with my bf (28M)?,"My boyfriend of 5 years scrapped his car in November - it had too many repairs and he couldn’t afford to pay for them and it wasn’t worth it with the age of the car. Since we don’t live together - we are moving in together in June - he has been sharing his car with his mom. His parents have 3 cars. He is getting tired of the back and forth of having to share and borrow with his mom’s car so he wants to get his own.

I currently own my car - it’s a little old but reliable. I bought it when I was student and kept it ever since. It’s a smaller hatchback car. Sometimes I complain about wanting something newer but with car prices right now and inflation - I have no need for a new car.

With our move, my boyfriend recently suggested that we buy a new car together. He suggested we get something that we’d both like and would be comfortable paying - we’d split 75%-25%, as he would be driving it more often than I would - but we’d be planning for the long-term by getting something bigger like an SUV we could keep for more than 5 years.

I quickly shut him down and he got angry about this which turned into a huge fight. He said I was being selfish. On my end, I own my own car and have no need for another bigger car. Car payments really don’t seem attractive to me. He argued that this decision would benefit us both as we’re basically buying something together that we could use together. I know deep down he doesn’t have bad intensions but this rubbed me the wrong way. 

TL;DR Boyfriend and I are moving in together. He wants to buy a car together. I already have my own car and don’t see why we need to buy one together. In my eyes, these kinds of purchases can be made separate.

During the argument, he told me that I was being selfish. Financially, I know that I am making the right decision for myself… 

Would buying a car together be better than having him make this purchase alone?

**Edit: Wow, this post blew up. I was really tired when I wrote this and slept pretty badly. Just hopping on to give a next day update.

My boyfriend and I spoke this over and have come to the conclusion that buying a car is not the way to go. For the time being, we will share my paid off car and see how car pooling together works out.

He deeply regrets calling me selfish and yes it was wrong of him to do so. He is not a bad guy - life hasn’t been easy for him and his parents are narcissists. Sometimes, I think he does lack some tact. So do I.

114,1cklsoy,AITA for expecting a friend to give me money towards a gift card I’m using on a trip for us?,"Context: me and my friend have agreed to take a trip to another city for a competition I’ve won and I’ve chosen him as my +1 I’m allowed to take.

He offered to drive us and whilst he hasn’t said it, it would cost about £100 in petrol and he would definitely (and I would expect) to give him £50 of that.

I mentioned I had £75 worth of train credit I built up, and the total value of the trains is £125 so we could get the train. I get the train with work a lot so I could expense that £75 and turn it into real cash easily so thats the true value. 

I’ve therefore now spent the £75 credit + £50 of my own cash to get us there. The value of my friends ticket is £75 (their ticket is actually more expensive than mine as they dont get a rail discount).

I mentioned before I booked to give me just £50 was fine (for a £75 value ticket). This way, they are paying for my cost to get down there, and they are essentially benefitting from paying only my rail discount price £50, they don’t have to spend all day in the car, and its the money they would have spent on petrol anyways. 

I mentioned before I booked this was £50 ok and they said to me they would pay me whatever I wanted that was less than £70 which is what they could have got it for anyways. They have not sent me the money yet and this was booked last week.

Last night this same friend called me greedy in an unrelated topic (for selling some of my posessions I don’t need anymore…not sure how thats greedy) and I was quite offended. This same friend stays over at my house all the time, they eat all my food and drink constantly, and never ask for anything for it and it doesn’t bother me.

I sent them my bank details this morning (as I had new details) and said to send them the money to that but there was no rush. I sent them several other messages but this is the only one they didnt reply too.

This friend doesn’t have a lot of money but I am wondering now if AITA for expecting them to contribute £50 to a £125 trip, does this gift card I had even matter? For context last night they also told me that I should get the parking cost on the day as they will be driving there (theres not much difference betwen the two). 

I feel like my friend is avoiding paying me the money and is a bit annoyed I’ve asked for the £50 contribution, but I thought it was fair. The trip isn’t for 3 weeks and my friend is gonna be on vacation till then. What should I do? Just mention it on the day?

115,1cklrvw,AITA for hurting someone’s feeling accidentally? ,"Im a carpenter and I frequent a building material store in the city I live. 

 It’s a reclaimed lumber store where they salvage old buildings, my clients sometimes ask if I can source alternative stuff there but I have to go digging to find something specific. 

 They have people who work on the floor to help find stuff and make sales…

 One of these people is a woman. I go there often enough to know them on a first name basis and we’ve got some cool stuff in common like sobriety and we’ve both lost parents. 

 Long story short she got my number out of their computer and asked me out on a date. 
 
 I communicated that I’d been dating someone and wasn’t available to go on a date. 

 She understood and was cool with it and I’ve been shopping there for the last 3 years without weirdness… until!!!!

 One of her coworkers asked me out🤦🏻‍♀️. Which was flattering but I’m still dating the same person I was dating 3 years ago. 

 I also told her that I’m dating someone and she was cool with it. 

 At this point I’m beginning to worry that there’s something weird going on with the plumbing that’s making the staff hallucinate because I look like Shrek. 

 I made the mistake of asking the first sales rep if they’d  recently received a shipment of led contaminated materials because her coworker had asked me out and she flipped out. 

 She accused me of misleading vulnerable women and shopping at the store for attention and kept escalating it to the point that  I’m a little afraid to go to the store again. 

 I don’t get it. I was honestly just trying to buy used building materials. 

 Am I the asshole for not prefacing every interaction with the opposite sex by telling them that I’m not available? 

 Cause that sounds like the kind of thing assholes would do!

117,1ckl359,AITA for admitting I want grandkids?,"Hey, Reddit. I, (54F), have a daughter, Caroline, (25F), who recently told me she is planning to be child free.

I know this is Caroline's decision, and I told her that I'd always support her no matter what, but admittedly, knowing I'd never have grandchildren stung. I'd always dreamed of having a large family, but I was only able to have one child, and now Caroline doesn't want any of her own, so that dream is gone.

I've done my best not to let my disappointment show to Caroline, because I don't want to put any pressure on her. It's her body and life, and her choice comes before my wants. But I guess I seemed a little down, because Caroline asked me if something was wrong.

Initially, I brushed off her concern and told her everything was okay, but I guess she mentioned something to her paternal aunt, Mabel, because I got a call from Mabel demanding answers for why I'd been off.

Well, I didn't want to lie. I admitted that I was a little disappointed by Caroline's decision to be child free and that I'd just need a little bit of time to get over it. Mabel wasn't happy with this answer and accused me of trying to guilt trip Caroline.

I asked Mabel not to tell Caroline what I said because it'd upset her, but I got an angry call from Caroline accusing me of ""talking behind her back"" and ""judging her decisions"".

Maybe I shouldn't have said anything to Mabel, but I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it has or to make Caroline feel like I was pressuring her, especially since I asked Mabel not to mention anything to her.

I just want to know, reddit, am I the asshole here? If I am, I'm fully ready to apologize to both Mabel and Caroline, but I just don't know what to think right now.

Thank you for all your advice. Some of it was more helpful than others, admittedly.

To the people making wild assumptions about how I feel about Caroline and assigning me the asshole because of it, sometimes in spite of what I wrote in my actual post, I suggest trying to understand before making assumptions and judgments in the future.

But, to the people who gave me helpful insight into how Caroline may be feeling and advice on how to move forward in healing my own disappointment and ties with Caroline, thank you. I'm going to take the advice given to me by many of you to heart.",0.0,1.0670429468154907,1,0
118,1ckkr3o,AITA for not wanting my cousins at my mothers funeral,"My mother was battling cancer for four years. She fought all those years because she loved her family and wanted to spend more time with everyone. In those two years she got 2 grandkids and knew another was coming which gave her even more energy to fight but unfortunately 2 weeks ago things suddenly turned around very fast and she unfortunately passed away yesturday.

She was the oldest of 4 kids and my uncle has 2 kids which my mother often babysat, gave christmas presents and she loved those kids.

During the 2 weeks she was in the hospital they never visited once. They didn't call her. They didn't even send her a text message. In fact, throughout the entire four years, they didn't do any of the above. The only thing they could say was 'thank you' when receiving gifts. 3 days before she passed I sent them both a text saying 'you should come and see my mother, it will be the last time you'll be able to'.. no response. I verified with their dad if they were aware of the situation and he told them what was happening.



After she passed I suddenly get the driest, most googled text saying 'I heard about your mother, im sorry for your loss.'



Now we're planning her service and I think if either of them show up I think I'll go nuclear and lose my shit. So AITA for asking they don't get invited and when/if they do show up to have them removed from the service? Being put outside is better than having a broken jaw.

119,1ckkm6f,AITA for giving my adult brother a curfew?,"I (24F) live about 6 hours from my parents' house. My brother, Ryan (18M), is going to university in my state and as such is living with me temporarily before he figures out living arrangements closer to the university. It's a forty minute drive from my place. Currently, he's looking for a part-time job. He arrived on Thursday. I work a 9-5 Monday to Friday, although with transport it's more of a 7-7, and am on call on Saturdays. 

I don't have an issue with him living with me, he cleans up after himself and pretty much just stays inside his room the entire day, does some chores and can feed himself. The issue is that for the last two days he's been staying out till 3-4 AM and I'm worried he's going to get into trouble. In which case our parents would be pissed off at me, as they've historically blamed me for his mistakes. Either way, I asked him what he was doing out at such a late hour and talked to him about safety concerns, and he said he was meeting up with people from the university he was going to. That's wonderful, but I said I'd rather he return before 12 AM. He got catty with me and asked me if I was planning to ground him if he broke the rules, and that he was an adult and deserved to be treated like one. I said I wouldn't ground him but I would kick him out, and then he could figure out his own shit like an adult. 

Of course, I wouldn't actually kick him out. He relented and we compromised at setting a 1 AM curfew. However, he has not talked to me for the whole day today and I'd rather him giving me the cold shoulder not continue for the rest of the month. Considering that I'm not his parent, I might have stepped out of line, and he has always been a good kid so I'm worried it might seem like I don't trust him. I talked to our parents about it and they said I shouldn't have set a curfew but rather just suggested he come back earlier.

120,1ckk9nx,AITA for giving my Mom the 'silent treatment' over spoons? ,"I (f16) have very traditional parents. Unfortunately, I'm very unusual and quirky, something that my parents, esp my mom, don't seem to be able to handle. I've been in charge of the kitchen for 6 years now, and I have a cutlery allocation system that basically gives every member of my family their own cutlery, and my mom has expressed her displeasure about this multiple times. A few days ago she took matters into her own hands and took my baby sis spoon to work and didn't bring it back. When I realized and couldn't find it, I spiraled down and was on the verge of tears with frustration, and she jut walked and said she 'lost it'.

This isn't the first time she's done something like this, I have my own systems for everything that I've been using for years and I'm not good with abrupt change, my wardrobe, my school locker, even the meals I eat. She got so tired of me having a cup of coffee and a cream puff in the morning and taking the same bread and spread to school everyday that she made my dad give us a meal roaster so that I'd have to eat different foods. This was about a year ago and I lost abt 6kg because it was hard for me to suddenly accustom myself to new meals.

She also regularly dismisses my personal preferences like my dislike of invading my personal space, weird noises, loud noises, bright lights (they give me headaches) and things like hugging and kissing. I'm a very detached person and feel genuinely uncomfortable with these things but she always gets mad when I refuse and this has been going on for years now. With my grandma here and realizing my nature, I've started hearing lectures on how I'm not acting like a child of God and my mom is overjoyed that she has someone to back her up now. Everyone at home is treating me like an alien now bc I won't talk, my sister asked me the other day 'why don't you care?' but I do care, I just do it a bit differently and I need them to understand that.

I'm just scared that I'm overreacting and being dramatic like my mom said.

  
EDIT: I emailed my school's guidance counsellor yesterday about it and I now have an appointment scheduled for Tuesday. I also looked up ASD and yes a lot of the symptoms are things I do but have just always watered down to me being a weirdo.

121,1ckk8ne,AITA for keeping my MIL from her grandchildren?,"My husband and I have two kids, a 7 year old boy and a 6 month old girl. We live about 7 hours from my family, and about 13 from his mom. We have visited both maybe twice since moving here 4 years ago. We don't get many chances to go anywhere, so we use our small amount of vacation time to go camping or to the beach or something.

My MIL usually visits once or twice a year, and stays for 2-4 weeks. We've been to my parents house a few times, but only for a few days. Last time being Christmas before last, because we had a storm and lost water and power that was expected to be out for a few days, and we didn't feel like freezing to death. We did spend a couple days with them almost a year ago, my parents, sister, and her kids vacationed near us. 

When my son was 3, two things happened with my MIL. We let him visit her for a week or two. Up to this point, he was really sweet and well behaved for a kid his age. Never really had tantrums or anything. My mom and I went to pick him up. Every. Single. Time we stopped on the way back, he had a tantrum. Like full on throwing himself on the floor kicking and screaming because he wanted toys or candy. We talked to her later, and she said ""I tried not to tell him no,"" and she'd bought him just endless candy. The other bigger thing that happened was when she visited us, while we were at work, she decided she wanted to go walk around Walmart. Took my small for his age 3 year old with her instead of leaving him at home with her mother or waiting 20 minutes for me to get home. Without a car seat. It's ok though, because she drove carefully. 

Any time my kid is around her, he gets all kinds of new and annoying habits. Being overly dramatic about everything, complaining of everything and everybody. Add all of this to the fact that she has a habit of treating my kid like he is hers, and a shiny new toy instead of a child, and she isn't my favorite person around my children to begin with.

Anyway, a few weeks ago, she told me she wanted me to send my son to her for the summer and she will bring him back when school starts. My husband and I agreed he could go visit for a week or 10 days, so I told her no, he could go for a week or 10 days. She told me to talk it over with my husband and get back to her. Since then she's sent multiple messages (including ones at 2am) asking if I'd talked to him yet, changed the time to a month, and tried to guilt me into sending her my child for a month because she doesn't get to have him enough. I keep telling her a week or so, and she just keeps insisting it isn't long enough. Every time she just tells me to talk it over with my husband and let her know. So I've stopped responding. Apparently she keeps telling him to talk me into it even though he also said a week. 

We would like to spend time with our own child, and go camping and such. And we both hate how he acts when he's around her.

125,1ckjv4t,AITA for asking my roommate not to step out of kitchen when something is boiling?,"little info: let's call my roommate Rachel

So a few days ago, Rachel wanted to prepare a new kind of dessert, made out of milk. She was very fond of making desserts and made them often, and I was confident that she wouldn't mess anything up. I gave her the whole kitchen to herself to prepare the dish.

The first step involved boiling the milk, so she did just that. After putting the milk to boil, she stepped out and started looking at other ingredients she needed. Suddenly she realised that she needed to buy saffron for the dessert. She forgot everything about the boiling milk and went shopping.

At this time, I had gone to take a little nap as I was feeling slightly dizzy . After an hour or so, I woke up to a horrible smell which was extremely unpleasant and pungent. After I managed to get myself out of bed, I made my way to the kitchen where, to my shock, I found the milk had over boiled and spilled everywhere.

I called Rachel and told her about what had happened. She then seemed to remember about the milk and told that she'll be back in 10 minutes. I then asked where was she, and she replied that she had found an old friend of hers in the shop and was in a restaurant with him.

She came quickly and looked at the horrible mess. I told her that we needed to clear this up ASAP, and that she ought to be more responsible in future. She then snapped at me saying that I shouldn't have slept back then and should have kept a watch on the milk when she had gone out.

I replied that I wouldn't have minded watching over the milk while she was out, or better, going shopping for the ingredients she needed, but as she was in charge, she could have at least made sure she had all ingredients in the first place.

So a few days ago, Rachel wanted to prepare a new kind of dessert, made out of milk. She was very fond of making desserts and made them often, and I was confident that she wouldn't mess anything up. I gave her the whole kitchen to herself to prepare the dish.

The first step involved boiling the milk, so she did just that. After putting the milk to boil, she stepped out and started looking at other ingredients she needed. Suddenly she realised that she needed to buy saffron for the dessert. She forgot everything about the boiling milk and went shopping.

At this time, I had gone to take a little nap as I was feeling slightly dizzy . After an hour or so, I woke up to a horrible smell which was extremely unpleasant and pungent. After I managed to get myself out of bed, I made my way to the kitchen where, to my shock, I found the milk had over boiled and spilled everywhere.

Before I get into it a few key things to note: I have recurring tendonitis from a dislocated shoulder due to childhood DV. He knows about this and has seen me struggle through a rotator cuff tear that happened when I fell during a workout nearly 3 yrs ago. It took 16 weeks to recover from that.

So in late February of this year, I woke up after having gone to bed the night before feeling completely fine and it's like my shoulder is being stabbed and the object in it is being twisted. I literally can't do anything. I can't bend my arm so that my hand is at waist level, I can't reach behind me, above me, to the side of me, nothing without that twisting stabbing feeling becoming worse. Even better, I can't really get a good grip on anything. So I went to the doctor got X-rays and an ultrasound, and yes my rotator cuff is inflamed again, my doctor puts me on naproxen and a narcotic pain killer, advising me to not lift more than 5lbs with that arm until it fully recovers and I have to take time off work to rest my arm and let the muscle heal. This is where trouble begins. My roommate insists that I need to keep up with doing my own dishes, cooking, cleaning, etc.

I try telling him what the doctor told me and he helps out twice before deciding that he's done enough and I'm faking it. Today I woke up and realized I couldn't make myself anything for breakfast as I had no cold cereal left, there were no clean pots or pans for making eggs, pancakes, nothing. I had toast but nothing to put on the toast so I knew it wouldn't stay with me. I texted him asking him to do the pots and pans when he got home today, and his response was, ""I only used the two pans. You clean your own stuff."" I went back and forth with him a bit and he was unwilling to budge, in desperation to get help from him, and not have to hurt myself even worse I told him, ""I need your help with this so my arm can heal. If you're not gonna agree to that I'll screenshot this convo, post it on FB and tag you for all of your friends to see."" To be clear I didn't want to, but I was at the end of my rope. He was literally punishing me for making myself pasta (I can cook one handed, not so good cleaning up one handed).

his response was ""whatever"", which I knew to mean, he wasn't going to help. So I followed through, a couple told me I shouldn't be airing it publically, and I agree, it shouldn't have come down to that, but I couldn't think of any other way to maintain his attention long enough for him to actually talk with me about this instead of just demanding his way or the highway, so AITA?",Asshole,2024-05-05,"AITA for publicaly outting my roommate's behaviour towards me?

127,1ckiuew,AITA For Parking On a Public Street to Take a Phone Call?,"Recently, I had the unpleasant experience of being threatened by a homeowner as I parked my car on his street.  I received an important phone call as I was passing through a mid-size city in rural Washington state, and instead of taking the call on the road, I turned off the highway and found a quiet residential neighborhood where I could finish up the phone call.  I had been thinking of grabbing a coffee and a sandwich anyway so it was good timing. I turned onto a pretty side street and parked in an appropriate street parking place.  My car is a normal-looking compact car in good condition, and I am a normal-looking person who does not at all look intimidating.  It was a beautiful day, and across the street I saw a 70-something man doing yardwork.  He eyed me immediately, and after about five minutes, he approached me car, knocked on my window, and asked if I had any business on this street.

I said I just parked on a side street to take a phone call.  He insisted I leave.  I said, ""Is this a public street?""  He said, ""It is, but we don't like any trouble here.""  I laughed and said, ""Do I look like trouble?  I'm driving a Toyota Prius.""  He said, ""No, you don't look like trouble, but here in this neighborhood we're a family, and we run people out who aren't part of the family.""  I found this statement fairly disturbing but didn't challenge him on it. Instead I told him again I was simply taking a phone call and looking for a coffee shop in town.  He said, ""Well there aren't any coffee shops over here.""  I clarified, ""No, I'm looking for a local coffee shop on Google maps,"" and held up my cell phone to show him.  He then threatened to call the police.  I said, ""Ok, well I'll tell them the same thing I just told you.  I’m taking a phone call while parked on a public street.""  He said, ""Are you saying you're not going to leave?  That's loitering.""  I said, ""This is a public street, and I'll leave when I'm done with my phone call.""

Throughout this exchange, I was polite, referring to him as sir.  Eventually, after making it abundantly clear that I was not welcome in his neighborhood and once again threatening to call the police, he walked away.  I wrapped up my call and also drove away, bewildered.

I had planned on spending some time enjoying the nice day and walking around the downtown that afternoon, but after this exchange I was too weirded out by the unwarranted paranoia of one of its senior residents.  As I drove away, my emotions switched from disbelief to anger to pity.  I don't know that man, or what sorts of traumas he may have experienced in his life.  But I saw him act absolutely insane to a normal person in a normal car who was doing nothing but quietly sitting and talking on the phone.

128,1ckirgl,AITA for “not helping” a blind person/people?,"Happened a few hours ago and I’m still confused and a bit annoyed. I’m on mobile and drugged up so I apologize for poor grammar. 

I’m going to add I’m disabled and had surgery two days ago. I’m using a cane although I should be in the wheelchair, and need help walking. 

Had a family outing to find a suit for my 14 year old. As we were walking towards the entrance of Nordstrom, I had my arm on my husband’s arm, my kids were walking next to me. We were having a discussion and were not really paying attention to our surroundings super intently. We saw other people near our vicinity walking as well, a guy going into the store that was walking about 5 feet next to us, a couple further back, people leaving the store AND another couple walking adjacent to us. If I had been walking faster, either them or us would have had to stop to let the other party pass. I noticed the lady was holding on the guy kinda like I was to my husband and with her other hand was looking at her phone and seemed to be following directions  on the phone. They both had walking sticks( like blind people use, unsure what they are called) and she was guiding him. Or at least it’s what it looked like to me, like when my husband guides me while I’m holding on to him. 

We came to the intersection we stopped to check for cars and let the couple with the walking sticks pass so we could go into the door. When we passed the couple and were about to enter the store the lady screamed “thanks for helping a blind person you stuck up bitch” we stopped and my kids asked us if she was talking to us. My husband said I don’t think so, I doubt it.  I turned my head the best I could to her direction and they had stopped and she was pointing at us screaming “yes, you racist assholes” and something else about us not helping cos he was blind  or disabled or some shit. I was seeing red at that point. 

I pulled my husband to walk and my boys but I did yell back saying she was fuking rude for being blind ( I have no idea wtf I meant.. again pain+drugs ).

129,1ckiqlk,AITA for taking my roommates share of the security deposit for myself?,"I live with 3 roommates, and a few months ago we decided that when the lease ends they would find a place together and my gf and I would move in together. A week before the lease ended one of the, messaged and asked if we could lease month to month. I said I already took care of it. Neither of us had any luck for the past few months, or so I thought.

The morning of our last day I Venmo request them rent and get started on my homework. I get a text from them saying “We'll be moved out by today and with a new place we can't afford to pay rent on two places"". I start to freak out. Why didn’t they tell me about this? What do they expect me to do? Where will I go? (they knew we had no luck in finding a place yet).

I finish my HW by noon and get to work. My gf lives in OC and cant help until 5 after work. Also, all of the big furniture is mine. The couch, tv stand, bookcase, kitchen table, etc. I bite the bullet and rent a Uhaul.

My gf and I (bless her soul) finally get everything out by 8pm and are left with a very messy apartment. I text our groupchat to come back and help clean.

""No, we’re already moved out and are getting settled in our new apartment""

I'm typically a patient guy, but at this point I lose my mind. Let me paint a picture for you.

The apartment is a mess. One of the rooms still had nails and staples in the walls and ceiling, the walls were dirty, and it looks like they didn't even sweep. The guest bathroom was gross, gunk in the drawers and on the sink and tub, hair dye stained on the sink, dirty toilet, dirty mirror. The master bed and bath weren’t any better. They also left behind all their food and utensils in the fridge and cabinets.

I am fuming as I am scrubbing the apartment. I tell them this is their ***last*** chance. Come throw away your things and help clean. 10pm another ding-

""We forgot a box can you drive to our new place and bring it to us?""

ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? No! I tell them to come help me clean. One of them finally stops by, grabs the box and leaves.

We finally finish cleaning at 1:30am. We have to park the Uhaul and wait till morning to get a storage unit. I crash in OC with my gf and in the morning we go back to get a storage unit. Once everything is settled and I've had time and space to clear my head, I message the group chat-

""You three made a choice not to come back and finish cleaning, after I gave you many chances to come. That is your choice, but now you have to accept the consequences of that choice. I have decided that when the security deposit comes back, however much it is, I will be keeping it all.""

Needless to say they are not happy about that. I think this is the best option for my gf and me at this point. We spent so much money and time cleaning and moving out without notice.

M messaged me a few min later saying what I did was uncalled for, I responded saying I didn't wanna hear about that crap and that it was ruining my birthday celebration. She came back saying I'm the one that ruined it. 

L also messaged me saying he left too after I did and that he was annoyed with H for that too. Also said H ""is just being insufferable"".

Both of us stopped being active for a while, he was taking anywhere from 18-23 credits a semester and I was working 40-60 hours a week to financially support us, his education and his family and would be to physically and mentally wiped to do anything (my husband is from Egypt, so we were paying out of country tuition without the ability to get loans or apply for scholarships because he didn’t want to wait to get his green card to go to school, and his family is still in Egypt.) 

He’s now finished his bachelors and only working a part time job as a lead rock climbing instructor, meanwhile I’ve found a different job that’s not so stressful and we mutually agreed that his family must find their own way to finance themselves since it was financially killing us. My husband has a lot of time on his hands and has begun being active again, going to the gym and rock climbing nearly every day. He doesn’t consider almost anything outside of those things to be exercise. He’s strongly motivated by how he looks. I, on the other hand, want to exercise when it’s fun and makes me feel good. Now that we’re in a marginally better place (and I do mean a very small margin) he won’t shut up about me being active and specifically wanting me to go to the gym. He brings it up almost every day to the point it’s not fun and I don’t feel motivated to be active at all because he ruins it for me by saying crap like “it’s not real exercise if you didn’t get your heart rate above 100”. 

When I try to talk to him about it, he accused me of starting an arguement (which it always eventually turns into) where he says crap like he’s “not pushing me, he’s just reminding me and encouraging me” or “you’re making a big deal out of nothing”. It also makes me very self conscious as I’ve never been this big before (he hasn’t lost any weight either. He does a very good job of replacing all the calories he burns). I finally put my foot down and told him to stop bringing it up and if I want to go to the gym I will, if I don’t, I won’t but I don’t want him to say anything about it anymore beyond telling me he’s going to the gym and asking if I want to go with him.

132,1ckijru,"AITA for telling my parent's I'd rather hang out at a particular café than go to family dinners, but will still show up anyways?","I 18M Just had a bit of a blowout argument with my parents, blowup on their end, I held my temper in check, something I've had trouble with in the past. Fundamentally, the core of the argument was them insinuating I'm a leech because I constantly forget to do stuff around the house. Fair enough, I have ADHD, and constantly forget to do things to a frustrating degree, but they take it as a personal attack and selectively notice it. For context, I'm not a NEET, I'm out of the house 7 days a week between work (\~30 hours, teach programming, pay is pretty shit) & class (14 units local community college). I also have (too many) personal projects I'm working on between continual study of ancient Levantine & Mesopotamian history & theology, particularly the Hebrew bible (as an atheist) on top of art.   


Back to the question, they seemed very offended about that statement, but they themselves have stated that they don't enjoy talking to me about any subject I'm interested in. They've told me that I should want to sit in the corner of the table quietly because it'll make them happy. But, simultaneously were upset when I said it felt like they wanted me to be window dressing. They told me that I shouldn't come to dinners at all, and that they won't wait for me to get back from work (usually get home an hour after their ideal start is. I have been telling them that starting without me is fine for years. They emphasized how wrong it was that I wished to spend time with strangers (I'm a regular, I know many patrons, or I work there) instead of wanting to be at dinner, where they don't want me to distract them from the table by talking too much. They kept putting words in my mouth, like saying that I hate them, or think they're shitty, and I kept saying that I had said no such thing. There's more to it, but I don't want to write an essay.  


As stated, I agreed I could & should do more, but want them to help me work around my ADHD, I asked them to give me exact details on what & when then wanted me to do things so I can set alarms. They brought up failures of mine when I was younger on tasks, and mostly refused to give details.  


There's also some mild spice around politics & religion, EG: parents believe many right-wing conspiracy theories, have no epistemology, and constantly just state things as if they're fact, and my mom has told me she considers my viewpoint nonsensical and rigid, which prompts me to explain standards of evidence, burden of proof etc... I thought my dad enjoyed our deep conversations  about philosophy & religion, since well, he's told me as much, fairly explicitly, but it's possible he's just trying to spend time.  


Overall, I'm just not sure. I've mostly built myself into someone I'm happy with over the last year, and most people share that sentiment...please tear into me with the Socratic method, I'll be honest. I want to know if there's something I'm fucking up or missing.

133,1ckij5r,AITA for buying a cheap sterling silver ring ,For context my fiance f(20) and I M(21) live with my parents ( We're currently saving to move out as I just got hired as full time 2 months ago and shes a stay at home mom). We got engaged a year ago after having our daughter and at the time I was only working part time and going to school so I used a $50 ring to propose. At the time she was fine with it but as time went on it began to fade and she wanted a newer ring. Well a couple days ago we went to the mall and while browsing she saw a diamond ring on clearance for 150 (220 with tax) and  asked for it. I asked her multiple times if that was the ring she wanted and she reaffirmed multiple times it was fine so I bought it and had it sent off the be resized. Ff to now she realized that the ring is sterling silver and has been doing research  that says SS rings are bad and are prone to fading quickly and now she keeps asking to return the ring and get a more expensive one that will last longer. I'm telling her that the ring we bought is fine for now as we're trying to save to move but she keeps insisting that since I always by things for myself I shouldn't cheap out on her ring (I bought a game console on my birthday with money I got from my parents). Her friend keeps reminding her that her fiancee spent over 1000 on her rings and that her fiancee is really cheap so I shouldn't have a problem with spending a little more. However her fiancee is 10 years older and gets paid over double what I do. Should I just give in and attempted to return the ring and get a more durable one?,Everyone Sucks,2024-05-05,AITA for buying a cheap sterling silver ring  For context my fiance f(20) and I M(21) live with my parents ( We're currently saving to move out as I just got hired as full time 2 months ago and shes a stay at home mom).
