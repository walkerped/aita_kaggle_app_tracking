0,1cl1qyl,AITA for not wanting to attend my sister's wedding?,"For context, I'm (25) an autistic ambulatory wheelchair user. I am underweight but am making small progress on my health. I also have severe anxiety about leaving home, especially staying overnight elsewhere. I also got my name legally changed years ago, and I identify as nonbinary. My family never uses my pronouns but some have accepted my new legal name. They’re also not happy about me owning a wheelchair. Even then, this wheelchair isn’t perfect, as I had to compromise with my dad to fit his “needs” over mine, and at times, I feel unsafe in it.

Regarding the wedding: my sister said ""I don't want you down the aisle in a wheelchair on my wedding day."" Any explanations of my needs were shot down promptly. Discussing dress, she wanted me in a dress. I wanted a suit, but coordinated with the bridesmaids. She still wanted me to try the dress she wanted for me. I gave it a try but immediately wanted to burst into tears, as you could see how thin I am without a second glance. It smashed every bit of confidence and self-esteem in me, seeing my exposed bony body like that. I held back tears, as she further berated me for my dyed hair, not wanting me to show up with ginger locks. 

She’s booked hotels, asking if I wanted to stay the night before the wedding or to grab a train to return home early, but I would have to wake up at 5am to grab the train, *without my wheelchair, alone*. On foot, I’m also in danger of overexerting/fainting. My family wouldn’t be able to transport me back (since they’re all staying at the hotel), and spending money on a taxi would cost me £70+ *one way*. I don't have that kind of money.

Arriving at my sister's pre-wedding party, I could read her lips saying ""oh god"" as she saw my wheelchair. Inside, my sister greets the family and asks why I brought my chair, as I explained to her that I would be in pain if I walked. She fires back by saying I am “embarrassing her” by using it. I folded, putting it away and using my walking stick. Later on, my sister introduced me to her friends and fiancée, but not my legal name, not my dead name, but with ""this is my sister, Chick."" I immediately butt in, explaining it’s my family nickname. Her friends get confused, thinking “chick” is my actual name, and I find out that she never used my legal name with her friends at all. She still refers to me as her sister, and refuses to use my legal name. 

At this point, I don’t even want to go to her wedding, when she disrespects me this way. I feel like I’m being told that I’m a sore sight for my own disabilities and how I present myself. I understand this is her special wedding, and I’m trying to meet in the middle with her, but I don’t feel like she’s compromising with me *at all*. I’ve done all I can to meet what she wants out of me up to this point, even if I don’t want to.

1,1cl0x25,AITA for wanting more space from my parents (UPDATE) ,"Hello people of Reddit:

If any of you are interested. A year ago, I posted on Reddit asking for advice about my parents (M55 and F54) wanting me (M27) to move back to our home town. 

Well.. a lot has happened in the past year.  I wanted to say thank you for anyone that commented on my last post.  All of the advice was welcomed and greatly appreciated. 

Around Thanksgiving of 2023 was when I sat both of my parents down to discuss my future plans.  I told them that it was my life to live and if I didn’t want to move back, then I didn’t have to move back.  Nothing was changing.  They weren’t going to lose me as their son as I still care for them, love and adore them.  

This was sort of a reality check for BOTH of my parents.  They apologized for being so controlling of that aspect of my life.  My mom even started to cry.  They told me that it was difficult to see me move out after being so involved with their lives over the past 26 years.  At the end of this discussion, we hugged it out and nothing negative has come out of this, which was what I was afraid of in the first place. 

I still love my job, I still love my friends, and I’m still with my GF (2 years in August) whom I am going to happily going to “pop the question” to this Fall!

Cheers everyone!  I know some of y’all want “spicy” updates when it comes to these stories, but that just won’t do lol 😂.",UPDATE,2024-05-05,"AITA for wanting more space from my parents (UPDATE)  Hello people of Reddit:

2,1ckq7o9,AITA for not telling my family my trans cousin was coming to my wedding?,"So this June, I (29F) and my fiance (29M) are getting married in the Catholic Church. My family is highly conservative, and whereas I’m moving along fine with the changes in our society, the rest of the family still remains conservative.  

Now this family member that I invited is biologically my 3rd cousin on my mothers fathers side. My grandparents adopted my “younger uncle “ when they were 3 and I was 5. I helped with teaching them to talk and we were raised almost like siblings!

As we grew older, my grandparents moved to a different city, they weren’t overly far, but it still took us 45 minutes- 1hour to drive there. So visits got shorter and less frequent. They were in middle school, so they started getting involved in other crowds, meeting new people. I still have concerns that all of this was taught, because this is a person that feeds on attention. When someone isn’t fully there it really is hard to figure out what’s real and what’s true. But regardless, they came out of the closet to me, first about being gay at 13years old. I thought it was a phase especially with an incident with one of my ex boyfriends. But still that shouldn’t “make someone gay” or whatever. As time went on, gay turned into bi, bi turned into trans, then for a short term it was trans and liked girls so “lesbian?”, and now they’re settling down to trans male to female and likes male. 

Through all the chaos and confusion, I loved them regardless. But my grandparents/ their adoptive parents, couldn’t accept them as they were, so “she” moved away to another state to start a new life in 2019. Ironically I just found out I was pregnant with my son when she moved. She missed all of the big milestones with him… 

Anyway, back to present time, we’re getting married in a month. And word got out that they’re coming. Another cousin that they talk to said something to her grandma (my aunt) and now all four sisters know. I was hoping that if no one else knew that it would slip under the radar as no one would be looking and pinpointing them out. The agreement was that her and her boyfriend would stay close to other friends and she wouldn’t mingle with the family. And we were both perfectly fine with that. But now word is out and I’m fighting with my mom and her sisters over it and I really didn’t want it to be a big deal. 
Now that the focus is geared on that I’m now concerned that it’s taking away the celebrations of our special day and us starting a life together.

4,1ckieqt,AITA for being upset I didn’t get invited to my childhood best friend’s wedding,"AITA for being upset I didn’t get invited to my childhood best friend’s wedding?

So my childhood best friend moved a few hours away back in 4th grade, we’re 22 now. We have stayed in touch all these years and still see each other once or twice a year. Well, she got engaged last year. I called her and we screamed on the phone and were so excited. When I started dating my current boyfriend about 4 years ago, I drove him to her city to meet her. She was an important person in my life and I wanted him to meet her. This girl and I have been friends for 15 years. She means the world to me. 
So, it never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t be invited to her wedding. She has a very wealthy family and they know a lot of people. She also has a ton of friends, she’s always been popular and makes friends everywhere she goes. So I know this will be a huge wedding.

Well, I didn’t get asked to be a bridesmaid. I didn’t take it personally, I knew she just had so many friends and I didn’t know any of them really despite meeting a few times. 
And then, her bridal shower pictures got posted. I hadn’t been invited to that either. But I again didn’t take it personally and figured maybe she just didn’t think I’d make the drive to be there. 
And then, I didn’t get invited to her wedding. It’s next month and I’ve yet to recieve an invite. Her and I chatted on the phone 2 months ago, 3 months ago, around Christmas. Our normal monthly check ins. Everything has been normal and fine. Well, she didn’t text me happy birthday in March. And then I texted her in April, no response. And now her wedding is next month and I didn’t get an invite. 
I know what venue she will have it at, because obviously I know her well. This venue is massive. I know her parents are multimillionaires at this point, so it’s going to be big. 

But I didn’t ever think I wouldn’t be invited. I thought there was a chance she’d ask me to be IN the wedding. I had planned on her being a bridesmaid in my wedding. And to not even be invited? 

I feel really hurt and confused. There was no falling out, no negativity, no reason I can think of that would make her not want me around. 

Am I crazy? Does this mean she doesn’t want my friendship anymore? Did she just forget about me? Should I even say anything or just let our friendship fizzle out since it seems that’s what she wants? 

I’m so hurt. The thought of not calling her my friend and never meeting each other’s future children is heartbreaking to me.

7,1cki7ph,"AITA for telling my brother I am not happy that he ""found love""?","  
Throwaway since I don’t know who in my life has Reddit.

I (18F) was not bullied in high school, but I was an overweight, shy, art kid- meaning it was a funny joke to ask me out on fake dates and laugh while I presented speeches in class. 

After an incident at junior prom where I and another girl wore the same off-the-rack dress, she was really aggressive to me. She was also into art, and in our classes together would say downright cruel things about me and my work during critiques (so bad that my art teacher stopped doing them). It did a number on my self-esteem and my pride as an artist and in a way impacted me furthering my art education. 

This weekend my brothers and I were all home from school, and my oldest brother (21M), told us he wanted us to meet his new girlfriend. For context, my brother broke up with a longtime girlfriend of his last year and only recently started coming out of the slump that left him in, so we were thrilled to meet this new girl. I was excited too, because despite the contents of this story I do love my brother.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-05,"AITA for telling my brother I am not happy that he ""found love""?   
Throwaway since I don’t know who in my life has Reddit.

I (18F) was not bullied in high school, but I was an overweight, shy, art kid- meaning it was a funny joke to ask me out on fake dates and laugh while I presented speeches in class. 

After an incident at junior prom where I and another girl wore the same off-the-rack dress, she was really aggressive to me. She was also into art, and in our classes together would say downright cruel things about me and my work during critiques (so bad that my art teacher stopped doing them). It did a number on my self-esteem and my pride as an artist and in a way impacted me furthering my art education. 

This weekend my brothers and I were all home from school, and my oldest brother (21M), told us he wanted us to meet his new girlfriend. For context, my brother broke up with a longtime girlfriend of his last year and only recently started coming out of the slump that left him in, so we were thrilled to meet this new girl. I was excited too, because despite the contents of this story I do love my brother.

 Except that this new girl was the girl from high school who also conveniently went to that college. Admittedly I got very emotional here. I started crying and shut myself in my room for the rest of the night, and later my brother came to talk to me after she had left.

8,1cki28f,AITA for telling my old roommate (20) that I (21) dont want to hear her self righteous bs?,"So I (21) moved back in September. I found a roommate online, L (21), and we needed to get another roommate. L suggested their old friend S (F20). 

Things got bad after S moved in: she stopped speaking to us after it was mentioned we were autistic, spent at most one night a week living with us (rest with her mum), refused to do any cleaning, was unhygienically messy, extremely rude, ext.

It felt like she was using our home as an AirBnB, and us as ""mum fairies"".

Yes we asked her on many occasions to clean. All we got was ""your cleanliness standards are too high"".

FINALLY she sent us a text saying she was moving out, and to find someone else.

We found C (26), who would mesh perfectly with our personalities and cleanliness (basic hygiene.)  C had to move from their current place as the landlord had suddenly told them the house was being sold, and they had until the end of april to be gone.

We told S on April 4th as soon as we found C. S collected her things but left the mattress. The mess she left was disgusting and I knew we had to thoroughly clean it before C moved in.

We asked when she would come collect the mattress her only response was ""when is C moving in?"", we explained the situation with the current place and told her preferably April 20th. Her only response was ""well I paid for this month, so its my room"".

Under normal circumstances this would be entirely understandable, but she wasnt even living there, and was at her mums, C on the other hand had nowhere to temporarily put their stuff. We told her again, asked her to look at her calendar and let us know when shes free to pick it up.

She got mad at us, about how she owned the room. I told her that because she was breaking the lease by leaving five months into the 18 month agreement, she was responsible for making sure everything was out in time for the new person, and that all we needed was a date. her response was to get extremely mad that I said she ""broke lease"", telling me she owned that room, we had no right to demand anything of her, and she would take it whenever she wants. she explained how she was so kind about everything she had done, like pay for the rent until we found someone (something she legally had to do), and how we were being mean.

I sent her a reply that said ""I dont want to hear anymore self righteous bullshit. I will not be communicating with you unless it is about the date you will be collecting the mattress. we need the mattress gone before end of the month, so that I can properly clean it, as it is unfit for someone to move into in it's current state of dead insects, spoiled food and evidence of rodents. just give us a date, S""

Some people have been saying I was too harsh, as the state of her room indicates mental health issues. I'm not to sures, though, and if she does it does not excuse anything. I might have been a bit blunt, but I was at my wits end, in near tears with frustration with this girl.

12,1ckhbjm,WIBTA if I told my wealthy FIL the schemes his other son is doing? ,"I (31 F) am engaged to my partner (40 M) and we welcomed our LO a few months an ago. My partner is very financially stable and has a well-paying career. I have a great job too and I’m going to school. 

So my fiancée and his brother (38 M) who I will call Bob went to school together for the same career, however Bob chose to go back to bartending while my fiancee stayed in the field. 

My fiancée and his brother have a very wealthy father. Their father bought them the houses they live in now and gave a trust fund at 35, giving them a head start for stability but they had to keep it going themselves. 
No more handouts after that. 

My fiancée used that trust fund for his mortgage. His brother Bob used his trust fund to not work for a few years. 

Then I came into the picture. And we got engaged after 2 years. 
Bobs gf became pretty threatened by this because Bob won’t marry her. And because he won’t marry her, she will not be getting any inheritance money from any family members. Mainly their father. (Crazy story here.)
 
Feeling threatened, the gf announces they are expecting … again. #4. 

Any penny they had left is completely gone now. 

Feeling desperate, Bob asks my fiancée if he can use his identity to find a good job under his name. He wants his resume, ID, social, etc., to get a well paying job in the same field. My partner tells him no. But Bob keeps pestering and pestering saying they are struggling.

then he asks my fiancée to borrow $20,000 while I am in the hospital. My fiancée says we don’t have that kind of money but it’ll be no even if we did. 

Then Last week Bob said he had no money for the mortgage this month and he could lose the house. He begged my fiancee. My fiancée felt so bad for him so asked for help fixing the roof for money. 

Yesterday, Bob showed up for 1 HOUR “to help” and then ran off because his gf wanted him to do the dishes. My fiancee still paid him in full.

Today Bob is asking for money and his identity again.

I told my fiancée his brother and his gf are spoiled freeloaders. I grew up with a single mom, living check to check. If we didn’t work, we didn’t eat. I still have that mindset. To have his brother coming in asking for savings that I’m also contributing to is infuriating.

I told my fiancée that I’d like to talk to his dad this week. 
You see… it is their dad’s name on Bobs house. I want to know what exactly is going on here. Shouldn’t their wealthy father help him out? 
But my fiancée says I’d be inviting drama and it’s an AH move.

Bob has adamantly refused cus he loves his house. Instead he’s asking people to pay his mortgage so his dad doesn’t find out and sells the house. 

The house issue: FIL paid for half the house in cash and mortgaged the other half for his sons so they could pay less monthly as he still wanted them to be responsible and work. 
He got them houses but did not fully pay it off so his name had been on both homes.

14,1ckh7f6,AITA for freaking out at my girlfriend after she made kissy faces to her male friends?,"I (M22) have been dating May (F22) for 2 years. She moved to the US when she was 13 and grew up in a very different culture. She didn't really make any friends while in the U.S.

May has a group of childhood friends⁰ (male and female) from her home country that moved to the US as international students.

For the first time, I finally met these people and we were hanging out with my friends as well at a Karaoke place.

May would joke around with her friends and get really physical, like hugging her friends from behind, putting an arm around their shoulders, touching each other's faces and etc. She's like this to only her friends.

During moments at the Karaoke, they would sing love songs to each other and have this drama like act. I admit, it was funny at first, but then they would flirt with each other and laugh it off.

One moment, i saw she was talking to one of her guy friends and she randomly gave him a wink and blew him a kiss. The dude gagged and they started laughing obnoxiously.

On our drive back home, I told her how her actions were completely inappropriate.

She said that's how they normally hangout and have fun by being touchy and ""affectionate"". And added that she understands I may have felt uncomfortable.

I told her I felt disrespected by how she acted.

She countered that some of her friends are dating each and everyone understands there's no romantic interest.

I didn't talk to her for the rest of the night and she just said ""okay,"" and had one of her friends pick her up.

16,1ckgyku,AITA for cutting my dead father sister off?,"My (F17) aunt (F36) had always disliked my mom(F38) ever since my dad has gotten with her. Before i was born, my mom and my aunt has always been at each others throat. The only reason they kept it somewhat civil is because my dad was the bridge between them two. My mom has always been patient, but my aunt has always been the one to make my mom loose that patience. 

Back in 2019, my dad passed away from a heart attack, and my mom thought it was finally time to make amends with my aunt, since that was always my dad’s wish. My mom called my aunt to tell her the news and she drove 2 hours, along with my grandma to see my dad one last time. Since it took her long, my mom decided to take him off of life support, to stop the suffering. My aunt made a fit, saying that she shouldn’t have made that decision, since my mother wasn’t his wife.

A few words were exchanged between those two and my grandma had to break it up. My mom was 5 months pregnant at that time, so the stress was really getting to her, so she decided to let that go. One evening my aunt asked my mom who was still pregnant to drive 2 hours so she can see me. My mom agreed and all was well, until my mom gave birth.

My sisters came out lighter than light and their skin barely had any melanin in it. Little back story, my mom and my dad has been trying really hard to kids, but wasn’t successful for many years. They finally decided to get a doner. Thats what my Grandma and my aunt don’t know. My aunt made a huge fit and my mom let her because she gets where shes coming from. The reason my mom wont tell them is because she’s afraid they wont believe her and bash her on the internet for being a “cheating wh*re” as what my aunt is calling her now.

 Fast forward to a week ago, my grandma was supposed to come over to see us as she hasn’t for the longest time. She called us and said shed had to cancel due to doctor appointments, which we totally got, since shes a cancer survivor. But one day my grandma called us saying that my aunt doesn’t care for her and that my mom is the only one that does, mind you my mom is not my grandma’s daughter, my aunt is. Then she tells how my aunt forced her not to come and told her to cut every one of us off. mind you, we all haven’t talked or even been in each other’s sight since 2021. 

My aunt tries to contact me here and there, and since shes my dad sister, i try so hard to satisfy her with responses, but what she has caused my mom mental pain, and my grandma mental aswell, i told her that i wont talk to her anymore because shes a messed up person, and deserves nothing but karma. She has ruined my relationship with my cousin & grandma. She had runied my mom’s mentality, and she had ruined herself even seeing me ever again.

18,1ckgl74,AITA for telling off my sister’s BF?,"   Am I the asshole for telling off my sister’s boyfriend? 
I have never really liked my sisters boyfriend, they have had a complicated and messy relationship the entire time and is very two faced. For reference I started hating him when I (17F) stayed with my sister(26F) for a week at her friend’s  house to dog sit last year.

  They started dating shortly after they both had failed engagements to other people, they had moved fairly quickly and my sister moved in with him about two weeks into their relationship. Around the four month mark or so he got her a dog as a way for her to stay with him since they were in a rough spot. 
During the winter I stayed with my sister at her friends house to help her dog sit. At the end of the week we had made plans to meet up with my dad at a Boston Pizza in the small town near the small town where I live. “Steve”(26M) lives in the small town where we were going to meet my dad and wanted to join us. At first I wasn’t against it till he had called my sister and started yelling at her through the phone while we were driving. He was pissed off that she didn’t originally invite him to come with, and about some plans she had made with her friends and her father(we have separate dads.) 
He was yelling at her and even started “intimidating” her at one point. I felt as though he was out of line and took the phone and yelled at “Steve”. I had asked him why he thought he could talk to my sister that way, and he started yelling at me and “intimidating” me as well calling me “A spoiled little rat.”

Usually I am a peaceful person, and often don’t resort to aggression but by this point “Steve” pissed me off since I have always worked for what I have and have had a job since I was 15, and raised myself due to absent parents. I had told him not to ever talk to my sister like that or me, and threatened him back and hung up. He called again and she was crying not understanding why he was mad or why he had said those things, so I answered it, told him we will text him when we got there and not to call her. 

BUT WAIT THERES MORE!! They broke up and were FWB and he cut her off completely to date another girl. Then he and the girl broke up and my sister and him got together AGAIN! They would lie about the hook ups when she was living with me and my dad, and sometimes she would come home with hickies and other marks. They are still dating, my brothers and I all dislike him. My older brother “Chad” just had his 20th birthday and nf my sister brought “Steve”. 
My brother was not happy and even said “I hope “Steve” is tolerable tonight or I’m going off”. When they showed up a few hours went by before my sisters BF started picking fights. 
He was saying things to me like “I hope you don’t turn out like your mom she is insane” and was ranting to me about something my sister said that annoyed him, when it was directed at our brother. I told him it didn’t matter since she wasn’t talking to him, and he had no right to make a comment about my mom like that since he isn’t part of my family and doesn’t understand what we went through as kids. He proceeded to raise his voice at me and told me not to talk back to him since he could be my brother in law one day. I stood up and told him to go fuck himself and get out since he wasn’t welcome to the party in the first place. My brother “Chad” agreed and some of his football buddies and our oldest brother walked “Steve” out. 

I feel like I may have had a part in the fights and my sister is upset with me about both situations, and has even called me an asshole over it. But my family is torn about who is actually in the wrong.

Today, I went to a gas station to grab my nephew a gift card for his birthday. It was an hour and a half drive with 3 small kids to where the party was. A line had formed because there was some issue at one of the cash registers so I got in the back of it. Two people proceeded to get in line on the opposite sides of the man in front of me. When he finally got up to the cash register, one of the women declared ""I was here first, she'll go next, and then you can go."" . I was a little bit frustrated that she hadn't asked me if I had been in line and then proceeded to tell her ""Actually, I had been here first and have been waiting in line a very long time. I am going to go to the register first."". She then got really rude and said ""No you were not, I was here."" To which I replied very firmly ""Actually no, I was here and watched you get in line after me. I followed the direction of the original line that had formed. If you have an issue with it you are welcome to ask the cashier who was here first, but I will be going up next"". At this point, I had already been in line for like 15 whole minutes waiting, it was hot, and though I usually wouldn't mind, I was tired from my ride and knew my husband was in the car with three cranky kids. She then said ""Who are you? You're like half my fucking age. Lines don't matter and you shouldn't bring the cashier into this."" My blood pressure was through the roof after her statement and general rudeness so I replied ""Age has nothing to do with it. General decency and respect does.""

She then said ""It's not that big of a deal. I'm not sure why you're making such a big deal of this."" As if she hadn't acted entitled and argued with me.

I generally avoid altercations. I don't like arguing, but I was sort of at my last straw. When I got up to the cash register I apologized and said I just didn't appreciate how she had assumed she was there first and had offered other people to go before me despite me waiting there well before her. I paid for the card and walked out.
She had a point though, it wasn't a huge deal, but I also think that if she had the social etiquette to have asked me if I was there, I still would have said yes... Because I was, and I was tired. Beyond that, her entitled nature and rude remarks were not needed. She didn't have any disabilities that would make waiting hard for her, and despite being older she was probably only in her mid to late 50s. Yet, I find myself wondering if I should have just turned the other cheek or handled the situation better.

Today, I went to a gas station to grab my nephew a gift card for his birthday. It was an hour and a half drive with 3 small kids to where the party was. A line had formed because there was some issue at one of the cash registers so I got in the back of it. Two people proceeded to get in line on the opposite sides of the man in front of me. When he finally got up to the cash register, one of the women declared ""I was here first, she'll go next, and then you can go."" . I was a little bit frustrated that she hadn't asked me if I had been in line and then proceeded to tell her ""Actually, I had been here first and have been waiting in line a very long time. I am going to go to the register first."". She then got really rude and said ""No you were not, I was here."" To which I replied very firmly ""Actually no, I was here and watched you get in line after me. I followed the direction of the original line that had formed. If you have an issue with it you are welcome to ask the cashier who was here first, but I will be going up next"". At this point, I had already been in line for like 15 whole minutes waiting, it was hot, and though I usually wouldn't mind, I was tired from my ride and knew my husband was in the car with three cranky kids. She then said ""Who are you? You're like half my fucking age. Lines don't matter and you shouldn't bring the cashier into this."" My blood pressure was through the roof after her statement and general rudeness so I replied ""Age has nothing to do with it. General decency and respect does."" She retorted again ""You're half my age, go up then and don't fucking talk to me."" I couldn't help myself, looked at her and said ""I have never met anybody so arrogant or rude."" She then said ""It's not that big of a deal. I'm not sure why you're making such a big deal of this."" As if she hadn't acted entitled and argued with me.

23,1ckfmro,AITA for not inviting my best friend’s mom to her surprise cancer free party? ,"
**Disclosure I got permission from my best friend to post this. 

Bear with me as this has quite some background. 
My best friend Molly (female 26) and I have grown up together. She’s like my sister. We grew up in a very religious (organized religion semi-cult like) atmosphere and went to a religious school.  After we both graduated high school, we were able to kind of leave that environment and  discover ourselves and have our own opinions and mindsets separate from the church.  It took a couple of years post high school to figure it out though. When Molly was 19, she ended up marrying her brother’s best friend, Carl, as her family “shipped” them, so she leaned into it based on social pressure.  They moved away for a few years due to Carl’s job.   Then moved back home about four years ago.  When they came back, Molly sent me this really long message telling me she and Carl were getting a divorce because she’s gay.  She finally had time to find herself while away and had been afraid to tell her family and friends because it kinda turns her life upside down.  She was worried about rejection.  I told her that I loved her and I’ll be there to support her no matter what and she’ll always be my best friend and I was proud of her for being brave and true to herself.  She came out to each of her siblings and her dad, all very supportive. When she came out to her mom and her stepdad, they weren’t as supportive. In fact her stepdad Gary even went to the extent of saying “if she’s coming over, I’m going to take my daughter (Mollys younger step sister Chelsea) and leave because I can’t be around her.” Which is some crazy homophobic shit and also exactly what she was terrified of.  But luckily, despite the lack of understanding and support from her mom and stepdad, she’s been able to grow more comfortable and stand up for herself.  Even setting healthy boundaries to avoid the homophobic and nonsupportive family members.  Because of this, Molly also had a strained relationship with her mother, who claimed that Gary isn’t homophobic he just doesn’t know her that well and doesn’t feel comfortable having his daughter Chelsea alone with Molly.  Which is bullshit because he’s known her for the past 10 years and Molly has spent lots of time with Chelsea before but all of a sudden now that Molly’s gay, he “doesn’t know her that well”.  Over the last few years Molly‘s been invited to her mom‘s house for events like birthdays or holidays and Molly has declined ever since Gary’s stance on Molly being over.  Molly’s mom is also a very controlling, negative, and self centered person.  So she doesn’t understand the boundaries Molly has made to respect herself.  For example, when Molly didn’t come over to her mom’s house for her mom’s birthday party, but instead said Happy birthday in a text and offered to go to lunch with her another day, Molly’s mom would get pissed and blog about it, and say how selfish children can ruin birthdays, but it’s okay Jesus was a martyr too.  Basically her blog is her an open diary but she tries to disguise it as a religious blog with passive aggressive stories (usually about her children) and slaps on a bible verse at the end to wrap it all together.  Obviously you can see why Molly had a strained relationship with her mom.  

Over the last two years Molly has been feeling like shit and going to multiple doctors to try and find the source of her health issues, after 18 months, she was finally diagnosed with stage 3 cancer.  After the diagnosis, everyone was devastated and sad, but we jumped in to support.  Molly’s partner, Taylor, and I would take turns taking her to chemo and doctors appointments.  Her siblings and dad all visited her and spent more time with her.  Through the course of treatments, she felt like shit, constant bone pain, weakness, nausea, etc.  Then her last pet scan revealed she was in remission and all she had to do was finish her chemo treatments up.  We couldn’t be happier with the news.  All Molly could talk about was finally feeling better and normal and celebrating.  So Taylor and I planned a small surprise party.  Inviting Mollys dad, her siblings, a couple of friends.  We even invited Mollys step sister Chelsea, however we did not invite Mollys mom or stepdad.  Mollys mom was upset she was not invited, and started to complain to Mollys siblings, saying “Why am I not invited, of course you leave me out, I’m the worse and you hate me”.  She was making it about her.  And then she said, “Chelsea is not allowed to go unless I am,” even though we’re pretty sure Gary already said Chelsea couldn’t go.  But Here’s the thing, or multiple things, 1.) What would Molly do? She wouldn’t invite her mom, for many reasons, partially because of the lack of connection and respect, and the boundaries she has set. 2.) Molly has never introduced her partner Taylor to her mom (again going back to the respect and boundaries thing, protecting Taylor).  We are not going to take away the choice and decision of how Mollys mom meets her partner for the first time, that should be up to Molly.  3.) Mollys mom would be uncomfortable with everything if she did come.  Again her mom is very religious and conservative.  And the essential theme of the party was fuck cancer.  We were also having it at Molly and Taylor’s house, which has pictures and art of naked women, a succulent plant holder that’s the shape of tits, and they have other “adult” decor like fridge magnets that say fuck, cunt, twat.  She would feel the environment is offensive, disrespectful, and be highly bothered with it, and most likely make passive aggressive comments on it.  4.) She’s not fucking invited.  You can absolutely have your feelings of disappointment and hurt about not being invited.  But that’s your responsibility to deal and process that (maybe a chance to self reflect on why you weren’t invited 🤷🏻‍♀️) and not put it on others pressuring them to have you invited.  And yes, you are Chelsea’s parental guardian and it’s in your right to say she can’t go, kinda fucked that you did a childish thing by saying she can’t go if your not invited but it’s in your right to make that choice so I respect it.  The most frustrating part of this is that Mollys mom can’t respect choices out of her control and also be happy and appreciate her daughter beating cancer, instead making it about her.   I’m not saying she can’t celebrate with her daughter or she shouldn’t have time to be with her daughter, but obviously there’s a lot of relationship healing that needs to happen and a surprise party is not the place or time for that. 

So Taylor and I stood firm on her not being invited and the siblings respected that, (most of them even agreed).  The day of the party came, we got Mollys younger brother to come up from college and distract her for a few hours as Taylor and I set up.  All the invited guest came, waiting to surprise Molly.  She came home and was actually surprised, (there were a few close calls on the surprise being blown so we got lucky).  There were customized cookies that said “fuck cancer” and “look at you beating cancer and shit” which she thought were hilarious.  We also got her a cancer cell piñata so she could beat cancer again 😜, which she loved. We all had a great time celebrating and most importantly, Molly was happy.  We later confirmed with her and told her about her mom, and she said we did the right thing, because she wouldn’t have invited her either.

24,1ckfkxi,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend’s ugly chair?,"Hi, longtime lurker first time poster. My (31F) boyfriend (42M) and I had a major house fire this past December and we lost 80% of our belongings. Amongst the items that were saved was my boyfriend’s 10 year old, dark green, ugly (in my opinion), oversized zero gravity chair. Sigh. 

Two months ago, we bought our first home as a couple. It was quite pricey, but we both work very hard and were a little traumatized from the fire and having moved several times over the last few years that we really wanted to choose a home we could imagine ourselves in for many years. 

My boyfriend (self admittedly) has no sense of style. He told me to decorate and design the house however I like. This is fine, but I also work full time and there is quite a lot of house to decorate and shop for and these things don’t come naturally to me so I’ve spent a lot of time researching and choosing how I imagine each room to be designed. 

We have a second living room, that we purchased a 150” projector screen for, and this would become our little ‘cinema room’. I LOVE movies and it’s one of my favourite ways to decompress. I got a sofa that fit perfectly in the space (it’s a bit squishy L shape couch that takes up a big portion of the room).

Well I guess you can imagine where he decided he wanted to place is old ugly zero gravity chair…yep. First off, I would have to remove a section of the couch, and it would just ruin the whole flow and stick out like a sore thumb. Secondly, we have very few moments together as a couple to cuddle and relax (on the average night less than 45 min), and this is primarily where we have been cuddling. So if he starts sitting in this dumb chair, well I’ll be by myself…this chair is basically the other woman in my eyes. 

I tried calmly explaining to him how it would completely ruin my vision for the room, and how I feel like it would also affect our couple time. But he’s telling me that I am essentially choosing my design over his confort and back pain. Also, that it’s been his only request etc etc. Not true; he is very particular on how he likes things to be ‘practical’ (ex: he likes everything in the home to be ‘smart’ like shades, lights, switches, locks etc and I happily pay for half of everything despite hating the look of them). Also important to note that I pay for my half of the entire house, as I’m sure some people will wonder.

He now says he doesn’t want to talk about the chair. That he feels it’s unfair. I’ve told him he can literally put it anywhere else in the house and I’ll be happy. But I know where he wants it…

Background:

-I have been really stressed about the number of people coming to the wedding because it is turning out to be very expensive and I am trying to keep the price down.

-I have always wanted a small wedding. I would like the event to be more intimate so that I feel comfortable being vulnerable. I don’t want to feel like I have to put on a “show” in front of a huge group of people, when I feel like the day should be about our love for each other. 

-We are already inviting quite a few people (imo)… ~60 for my side ~80 on his. 


The Situation:

-My fiancé has a half-brother (let’s call him Sean) who he is not particularly close with. This half-brother has a step-daughter (20YO, let’s call her Cass) who my fiancé is even less close with.

-Sean’s wife/Cass’s mom called my FMIL about a month ago and asked if Cass could bring her boyfriend to the wedding. FMIL said no. 

-Sean’s wife then texted my fiancé just shortly after and asked if Cass could bring her boyfriend to the wedding. He said no. 

-We have just recently found out that Cass’ boyfriend will be flying with her when she travels to the wedding. Apparently she isn’t the biggest fan of flying and he is coming as support. The flight is about an hour long. Sean and his wife are driving (~12 hour drive) but she isn’t driving with them so that she can get home faster after the wedding. 


The Dilemma:

-They are now asking again if he can come to the wedding since he will already be in the area. 

-My fiancé and I talked about it again today and I said that I guess we can make a seating chart and if there will be extra room at their table then he can come. We haven’t told them this yet though. 

-But I’m now just thinking that I don’t want him there just out of principle. I feel kinda manipulated into having him… they are just bringing him and I feel like they are guilting us into having him since he’ll already be in the area. That family makes no effort into having a relationship with either of us so why should this person get to come? But I feel like it would be petty to not invite him now. 

-My fiancé just wants to keep the peace. I feel bad that he has to be the middle man here.

26,1ckf8rv,"AITA For telling new neighbors exactly what we were going to do, and then doing it","
We inherited a house and land when my fil died. It is a nice house on two acres in the country. No HOA. No neighborhood, just a neighbor to one side and to the back. Everyone one else was further away. We decided we would take the opportunity to use the land, put a couple of tiny houses on it for our kids and set them up. We brought this up multiple times with pretty much everyone who would listen. We discussed legality, viability, all repercussions,  everything. We told everyone our dreams of a homestead of a semi-village where our children lived here on the land with us (albeit in tiny homes) and we had farm animals and gardens and whatever sustainable practices we could muster. Nobody poo-pooed our plans outright. The back neighbor said we wouldn't be able to install a septic but they were wrong. The side neighbor said property values might go down but they weren't planning on selling so it wouldn't matter. This is a place in rural Arkansas where people have cattle, horses, goats, chickens, ducks, emus, multiple buildings on their property, including one person about a quarter mile away who has a rv set up for living in. People have dog runs and broke down vehicles and tractors and barns and all sorts of stuff. The property in front of us has an old industrial scale chicken factory (can't be seen front the road).

Today the guy behind us was using an auger and I walked over and joked ""are you digging for gold?"" And he went off on me about how he is installing ""a shield"" because our dog keeps going over there and pooping on his land and he doesn't appreciate the eyesore of our buildings and how we are bringing property values down. However, He has no fences to keep other dogs out, and the people behind him have two very large very hyper retrievers who regularly walk all over his land leaving huge piles (and on my land too). So it isn't uncommon for free range dogs in this area. I make it a point to keep our dogs inside as much as possible, or on leads, or in the fences we have been able to put up.

 I explained that we are trying to help our kids because life is hard nowadays and he mentioned something about ""did you ask anyone (for permission to put up buildings)"". Then he goes on to say that one of the other guys behind him ""has to mow because you wont"", referring to land that isn't ours to mow which confused the hell out of me. Our land has weeds which come almost to the knee but we are allowing to grow a bit because there's flowers and we are trying to allow the beehive to gather more locally and the weeds are pretty spare, just a little tall.

I mentioned that we are working on putting up a fence but trying to figure out what would be best. I told him I had hoped that if he had a problem with something that he would have said something to us sooner. He said everyone is mad. Him. The neighbor beside us. His neighbors behind him.

We brought this up multiple times with pretty much everyone who would listen. We discussed legality, viability, all repercussions,  everything. We told everyone our dreams of a homestead of a semi-village where our children lived here on the land with us (albeit in tiny homes) and we had farm animals and gardens and whatever sustainable practices we could muster. Nobody poo-pooed our plans outright. The back neighbor said we wouldn't be able to install a septic but they were wrong. The side neighbor said property values might go down but they weren't planning on selling so it wouldn't matter. This is a place in rural Arkansas where people have cattle, horses, goats, chickens, ducks, emus, multiple buildings on their property, including one person about a quarter mile away who has a rv set up for living in. People have dog runs and broke down vehicles and tractors and barns and all sorts of stuff. The property in front of us has an old industrial scale chicken factory (can't be seen front the road).

Today the guy behind us was using an auger and I walked over and joked ""are you digging for gold?"" And he went off on me about how he is installing ""a shield"" because our dog keeps going over there and pooping on his land and he doesn't appreciate the eyesore of our buildings and how we are bringing property values down. However, He has no fences to keep other dogs out, and the people behind him have two very large very hyper retrievers who regularly walk all over his land leaving huge piles (and on my land too). So it isn't uncommon for free range dogs in this area. I make it a point to keep our dogs inside as much as possible, or on leads, or in the fences we have been able to put up.

 I explained that we are trying to help our kids because life is hard nowadays and he mentioned something about ""did you ask anyone (for permission to put up buildings)"". Then he goes on to say that one of the other guys behind him ""has to mow because you wont"", referring to land that isn't ours to mow which confused the hell out of me. Our land has weeds which come almost to the knee but we are allowing to grow a bit because there's flowers and we are trying to allow the beehive to gather more locally and the weeds are pretty spare, just a little tall.

I mentioned that we are working on putting up a fence but trying to figure out what would be best. I told him I had hoped that if he had a problem with something that he would have said something to us sooner. He said everyone is mad. Him. The neighbor beside us. His neighbors behind him. People in town. Everyone. ",0.0,1.0592636,1,0

I can’t afford to live on my own atm and my mom knows that (gotta love california) but I do help with utilities, our phone bill and sometimes rent whenever needed. at 24, I have never had a boy spend the night in my room. I had my bf for the first time two nights ago and my mom texts me that if he is going to stay the night again, he has to be on a blow up mattress in the living room and I sleep in my room. she just keeps mentioning that it’s her home so I need to respect her wishes but 1) it’s extremely abnormal for her to be so controlling of what I do at 24 (but expected, I grew up in a very conservative christian household) and 2) I do help with bills, it’s not just her home even if the lease is only in her name. she even admitted it was “our home” when I brought this up. I offered keeping my door open and she is still on having him in the living room. I just am frustrated but not surprised, I guess. I would just stay at his house but he shares a room w his brother and that seems even more uncomfortable.

to add some context, I am in the process of moving 2 hours away come august for school and I think she is taking this super hard. if I’m being honest, I think she’s just doing this because she wants to use whatever control she has left on me and she knows I don’t want to ever disrespect her.

28,1ckez4p,"AITA for going against my parents’ wishes of going to a prestigious school, and instead going to the school that gave me the most money?","Hi everyone! For context I (18F) got into the University of Virginia (UVA), and the College of William and Mary (W&M). UVA was one of my top schools for the longest time because I thought it was prestigious and it was pretty good for business, since that is what I am majoring in. However, I applied to other schools that I would go to besides UVA, in case I had gotten rejected. I mainly applied to schools within my state and nearby states.

 I got into UVA, and that was exciting! On the contrary… the price tag was not attractive. I would have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to UVA. On the other hand, I got accepted to W&M with a full ride! And a research grant, which would look very good to graduate schools and potential jobs! Additionally, I would get the newest dorms available because I got the specific research grant! 

I told my parents my options and they still want me to go to UVA because it is better for business. My parents said not to worry about money, but I do not want to be financially tied to them because they might take away my tuition or have control over my life since they are quite religious and conservative.

 I toured both campuses, and I honestly liked W&M better because it was less busy compared to UVA! And… no student debt! Also, everyone was more helpful and friendly to me at W&M when I toured, and the tour was actually led by someone whereas UVA’s tour was self-led. Overall, I just liked the feeling of W&M better. 

Now my parents are very disappointed in me in choosing W&M and trying to get me to change my decision. They are saying that I am selfish, careless, and too young to be making major life decisions. However, I asked all of my counselors, teachers, my smartest peers and just about everyone said they would choose W&M, given my decisions. I tried to explain to my parents that undergrad does not matter, and that I’ll go to business school anyways after college/university. They are still firm on their decision because they are “immigrants who worked hard to give me the best possibilities, and to take the largest opportunity, which is UVA.” They say money isn’t a problem, but I am not comfortable with the decision. They keep sending me statistics about how UVA is ranked higher and all of that, and are guilt-tripping me trying to change my mind. They have been crying non-stop about my decision (I haven’t committed yet), but honestly I think they just want bragging rights that I go to UVA. 

So, Reddit AITA for choosing to go to my choice of university/college over my parents’ preferences? Any help would be appreciated because they won’t support me anymore and I will be disowned if I go through with my decision. 

Thank you. 


EDIT: Thank you all for your support, it means a lot going through such a stressful time. To answer some questions, I will be majoring in business with a concentration in finance and also double major with either statistics or math. I plan to get an internship or job after college and have work experience and eventually get my MBA (hopefully!) So, the cost of UVA for 4 years is about $80k+ and W&M has no loans attached to it either, everything will be paid for by the scholarship or grants. Also, W&M accepts more of my AP credits of that helps lol. Additionally, we are South Asian lol.

29,1ckeuxl,WIBTA for asking my ex not to talk to my family?,"So my ex partner (16NB) broke up with me (16M) a couple weeks ago, we were together for just over four months and we had both met each others families. The break up wasnt expected but i didnt really take it to heart, however we havent spoke at all since and i feel very bitter towards them. 

They spoke often with my sister because they had a lot of common interests but i expressed whilst we were together that them talking over the phone or social media every day made me uncomfortable as my sister is 11. When we broke up I spoke with my mum about how i could go about sealing that gap for good because they were still in contact after we broke up. My mum said that i shouldnt get in the way of who my ex keeps contact with and that it wasnt my business, however i kept a mental note that if it kept going i would have words with my sister about it. 

This week my mum posted a couple things on facebook involving me and my sister who my ex commented on and liked, which made me feel very uncomfortable, especially as i had immediately unfriended their parents after we broke up. 

I think i should give them the firm response and tell them to back off before this spirals, but my mum’s comment has made me feel like making them cut contact would be a dick move and could make conflicts worse?

Would i be the asshole to talk to my ex about things that could upset them and my family? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-05,"WIBTA for asking my ex not to talk to my family?

30,1ckeru4,"AITA for dressing up in a ""questionable"" group costume per my friends request","So my best friend for about 7 years, we'll call him Derek, is a little person. He has 3 brothers who are all little people and they are all so comfortable with their lives and love making jokes about their height. I have somewhat of a dark sense of humor but was uncomfortable joining them in the jokes until I really got to know them and they assured me it was ok.

Anyways there was a costume party for our mutual friends birthday where everyone was supposed to be a movie character. Derek and his brothers came to me and asked me if I would be comfortable dressing up as Willy Wonka while they all dressed up as Oompa Loompas. I said sure and we went to the party. We got a few looks, but nobody said anything at the party.

Well this morning I woke up to a bunch of texts calling me a horrible person for doing that and insinuating I made the suggestion for the group costume. No matter what I say in my defense gets blasted back at me as doubling down on my ignorance.
