1,1clr84r,"AITA for dressing up in a ""questionable"" group costume per my friends request? *UPDATE*","First I would like to make some clarifications since I didn't mention them in the original post. I am a 22M and Derek is 21 and is the 2nd youngest of his brothers. We were specifically dressed from the 1971 movie with Gene Wilder and Derek and his brothers were the only little people at the party. I had around 30 texts complaining about the costume all of them people I barely know or had only met at the party which had about 150 to 200 people. Out of all those only 3 were just saying Willy Wonka in general is offensive and the rest were accusing me of forcing the idea and wouldn't believe me when I told them it wasn't my idea. Anyways, onto the update. 

A couple minutes after I posted the story I got a call from Derek. He said he had recieved some texts from people from the party regarding the costume, telling him they were messaging me to get me to apologize to him for my ignorance to which he informed them it was his idea. He was then told what happened. 

Apparently, his younger brother, we'll call him Ethan, wasn't wanting to be an Oompa Loompa for the party but got roped into the idea by the others before coming to me and had made a passing comment about it during the party. His comment was either taken as all 4 of them were unhappy with the costume or word spread and got twisted into it being my idea. Basically, it was a huge misunderstanding.

Ethan called me a few minutes after I got off the phone with Derek and apologized for getting me in that situation. He told me he had bought a separate costume he was wanting to wear for the party only to be told Derek had already bought 4 Oompa Loompa costumes and couldn't return them. So he figured he'd save the separate costume for Halloween. He said someone came up and asked him about the costumes and he answered honestly, but didn't think his comment would cause anything especially since the end of his comment reiterated he was having a good time. 

Derek, Ethan and his brothers have all come to my defense, and while nobody who was sending me demeaning texts has apologized. They have officially stopped the texts.

Anyways, thanks for the support. As I said in the original post I try to ignore people's negative opinions of me, but 30 people was alot and I was just so overwhelmed that I thought maybe I did do something wrong. Glad to know the whole situation was just a mix up.",UPDATE,2024-05-06,"AITA for dressing up in a ""questionable"" group costume per my friends request? *UPDATE* First I would like to make some clarifications since I didn't mention them in the original post.

2,1clnyq7,AITA for wearing white to a wedding?- UPDATE,"Hi everyone!

So, time for an update. I told my friend about the situation after I posted because I didn’t want her to be angry right after/during her special day. But first let me explain what happened after she spilled soda on my dress. I went to the bride’s sister and explained everything and told her not to tell the bride. The sister and I went to the home of the bride and groom (she has the bride’s key and they live near the reception building) because my luggage was there and I changed. Luckly I had a dress, unfortunately it wasn’t a long gown but a short knee length dress. The bride noticed when I went back, and I lied and told her that the other dress wasn’t comfortable, and we went on with the party.

Then I sat down with the bride. I told her and she became so pissed and told me she never wanted to see those people again. We messaged the girl and the bride told her to pay up for the cleaning and the girl surprisingly paid the full amount. She had thought the bride wanted to stay friends but after she sent the money to the bride via venom my friend blocked her and the others. She apologized and I told her it wasn’t her fault. I’m staying another week here and it feels a lot better with having told her everything. Thank you all for the replies on my other story.",UPDATE,2024-05-06,"AITA for wearing white to a wedding?- UPDATE Hi everyone!

3,1clj4dm,AITA for wanting to choose my own happiness over my mom’s?,"Before I continue this, I just want everyone to know that I am very aware of everything going on in our lives and I don't fault my mom for anything that's been going on.

My mom (50f) and | (23 nonbinary), have been struggling financially for a few years now. Recently, it's been at its worst, to the point where certain utilities are threatened to be turned off, such as gas, water, electricity, etc. My mom has a full time job plus a side business that she's been doing for a few years to bring in extra money. I, also, have a full time job and starting a new side business soon, to help us.

For the past few weeks, my mom has been feeling very depressed about our situation, more so than usual. So much that we would be sitting down, watching tv, and she would randomly say things like ""this is the most depressed i've ever been,"" or ""i have to be one of the most unhappy people in the world right now."" I appreciate her expressing these things to me and I want to know when she's feeling down. But it's gotten to the point where she gets upset with me if i have nothing to say or contribute.

For example, one night, we had nothing to eat for dinner. We both worked at our full time jobs that day (she works her usual 8am-4pm, i worked my usual 3pm-9pm). I don't get home til 10:30pm almost every night, so it's usually too late for me to eat anything, so i don't. But sometimes, she'll text me before i leave and asks me to pick something up. I was honest and told her that i didn't have the money to grab anything for her and that if she wanted it, I had some noodles she could cook up or have something leftovers she had made the previous week. I thought everything was fine until I got home. She was very short with me, only giving me one word answers. I tried to cheer her up by telling her some funny stuff that happened to me at work, and she gave me nothing. I asked her what was wrong and she said ""you came home, not even concerned with what i should have for dinner.""

This happens quite often and it's getting to the point where it's weighing on my mental health. I hate coming home because I know as soon as i step through the door, I'll feel guilty for not being able to do anything to help. No matter what I do, it's never enough. I can't stand being in a place where I'm never happy, just because my mom isn't. When im not home, i'm smiling, laughing, and very social!

Like I said before, I'm very aware of our situation and her reactions are warranted! But i just can't help it, having this feeling of wanting to get away because of all this pressure on me to help make things better for us. I just want to get away for a while, work on my mental well being, and focus on my happiness.

4,1clb3bc,AITA for thinking that my mother is a NARCISSIST/Pathological Liar who shouldn't have another child?,"My (17 Trans Masc) mother (36 Female) is a raging narcissist and keeps talking about having a child with my stepfather (30 Male). I have never been more opposed to an idea in my entire life. 

To make our history concise: We have a horrible relationship. She was an addict and felon who was in and out of prison for a while, and only got me back into her house when I was 14 (after basically abandoning me and pawning me off on the rest of the family starting around age 3 or 4). When she came back into my life, I was thankful to finally have her back to start forming my own opinions of her because everybody else seemed to hate her. 

Now I know why everybody hated her so much. She's an immature, irresponsible, narcissistic, bipolar *SSHOLE who can't be trusted with money and needs a harsh reality check. 

I am adamantly against the idea of her and my stepdad having a child together. She's also genuinely trying to go about it by saying ""OK, if we get my tubes untied, I'll give you a baby but you have to take care of it."" 

My only question for her is: How well did that work with the dog that ended up becoming yours? He's the one in the wrokforce, you have job-stopper tattoos everywhere AND a record. 

We also have money issues right now. FFS, for the THIRD TIME in my life I sleep on grama's couch, and you guys are sleeping in my cousin's room. Dad makes minimum wage. Where is the room for a baby to even begin with?

5,1cl9hys,AITA refusing to accept my aunt’s apology out of pettiness? And for swearing at her?,"I (21f) do film and tv extra work as a side job. 

A while back, I was cast as an extra on a  project set during World War II. Specifically, I was playing a concentration camp prisoner and had to shave my head for the part.

During and after filming, I had to deal with some pretty backhanded comments about my look. I’m already pretty skinny, so I had family and strangers commenting about how I look like a cancer patient. Or a boy.

My uncle’s wife was especially nasty about it. She’s pretty conservative so she was make all these comments about how I look like a lesbian. I broke up with my ex-boyfriend around that time, so that didn’t help. 

My family was really great at shutting down my aunt’s nastiness, but she was still making jabs about my bald head months after filming wrapped.

6,1cl9ed5,AITA for snapping at my mum over a haircut,"I (24F) went out with my mum yesterday to the mall for a haircut - she said she wanted to accompany me because she needed to leave the house for a bit, so I said ok. She's always followed us out to get haircuts since we were teenagers, anyway.

I went to get my hair cut. After we finished, I followed her to shop around for some things for a bit, then we walked home.

On the way back through the mall, she suddenly noticed that the back of my short hair (it's a bob cut) looked uneven. She told me to stop walking and kept touching my hair to check, and even pulled me aside to take photos to show me what the problem was. I looked at the photos and told her that I didn't see anything wrong with it. To me it just looked like a bit of styling done on both sides that resulted it in looking sort of uneven.

She kept telling me that it was uneven and that she had never seen this issue with my hair before, and insisted that I go back to fix it. I didn't want to because there was nothing wrong with it and I didn't see the point in going back to the salon to kick up a fuss over something as trivial as this. She said that it was the hairstylist's fault for not cutting it properly and that they should fix it and we should not have to pay. I was tired and wanted to go home, so I repeated that I was okay with it and that I didn't want to go back to the salon.

She didn't seem to be listening to any of my explanations - she kept saying that it was improper and that I would look like a fool going out in public with uneven hair. I was going to snap at this point. When she asked why I didn't want to listen to her, I lost it. I told her that 'it's my hair, not yours.' She got angry, and then told me to go home by myself. I did. I kept walking and didn't look back.

She came home later at night and she's been silent ever since. I texted her an apology and told her that I was sorry for what I said and for walking away. I explained my stance and how I felt there was no need to go back, since the haircut looked okay to me. She hasn't responded and I think she's still angry.

Was what I said too harsh? Would appreciate some advice as my feelings are all over the place about this and I don't think I can think objectively about this right now.

7,1cl93kb,AITA wife's sister lets her kids run wild and destroy my house during family dinners. So I voiced my opinion. ,"My wife has her siblings over for dinner EVERY week. Two brothers and two sisters. Only one is married with kids. These kids are not parented at all. Many times we have to stop a child from serious injury because their parents just forget they exist. 
Tonight I bought a cake for my wife's birthday that is next week, since I will be leaving town for work and missing the date I wanted to celebrate. The oldest of the little guys (6) starts literally pounding the floor full blown tantrum that I won't let him Carry the cake lit with candles to the table. I ignore and proceed. 
After cutting the cake and bringing my wife her piece, the little brat jumps up and smashes his toy truck down into the middle of it. I get my wife another but she just eats around it and says she doesn't mind. I brush it off. Minutes later the toddler kid #3 is seen running through my great room with a spoon full of icing that his mom Gave him. And another child #2 ,is using an egg roll as a missle smashing it into my walls. 
My wife permits this anarchy, I keep my mouth shut as usual. After the circus leaves our house. I'm cleaning up and doing dishes by myself. My wife walks in and she sighs relief that they are gone. I made the mistake of venting how frustrated I am that her sister, her husband and children have zero respect for our home. The response was a rage filled screaming match about how absolutely Terrible I am and that she will make sure her sisters family is never present when I am home.
 
TLDR wife lets her Neice, nephew destroy our house on a weekly bases and then screams at me when I voice frustration. 

Edit: background my wife usually cooks and cleans up after her family get togethers. This time I chose to take over.  I do my best to assist in prep and cleanup. I get that even though I am home only half the month, I still need to engage in the household duties. I try to make up for my absensce when I'm home. 
Edit 2: Many of you have mentioned that I should let her threat of never having them over when I'm home come true. It's an empty threat meant to make me fearful of her running down my character to her family/ friends. 

Update: 
Sat down with my wife today and established this behavior won't continue. We are in agreement to start with marriage counseling again. She apologized for being mean. I stood my ground that the verbal abuse won't continue. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-06,"AITA wife's sister lets her kids run wild and destroy my house during family dinners. So I voiced my opinion.  My wife has her siblings over for dinner EVERY week. Two brothers and two sisters. Only one is married with kids. These kids are not parented at all. Many times we have to stop a child from serious injury because their parents just forget they exist. 
Tonight I bought a cake for my wife's birthday that is next week, since I will be leaving town for work and missing the date I wanted to celebrate. The oldest of the little guys (6) starts literally pounding the floor full blown tantrum that I won't let him Carry the cake lit with candles to the table. I ignore and proceed. 
After cutting the cake and bringing my wife her piece, the little brat jumps up and smashes his toy truck down into the middle of it. I get my wife another but she just eats around it and says she doesn't mind. I brush it off. Minutes later the toddler kid #3 is seen running through my great room with a spoon full of icing that his mom Gave him. And another child #2 ,is using an egg roll as a missle smashing it into my walls. 
My wife permits this anarchy, I keep my mouth shut as usual. After the circus leaves our house. I'm cleaning up and doing dishes by myself. My wife walks in and she sighs relief that they are gone. I made the mistake of venting how frustrated I am that her sister, her husband and children have zero respect for our home. The response was a rage filled screaming match about how absolutely Terrible I am and that she will make sure her sisters family is never present when I am home.
 
TLDR wife lets her Neice, nephew destroy our house on a weekly bases and then screams at me when I voice frustration. 

Edit: background my wife usually cooks and cleans up after her family get togethers. This time I chose to take over.  I do my best to assist in prep and cleanup. I get that even though I am home only half the month, I still need to engage in the household duties. I try to make up for my absensce when I'm home. 
Edit 2: Many of you have mentioned that I should let her threat of never having them over when I'm home come true. It's an empty threat meant to make me fearful of her running down my character to her family/ friends. 

Update:

AITA for not wanting to run over a duck? 
To give some context, my partner is a devout animal lover.
Me and my partner had just been sitting down having a drink at a bar in the sun in town,
 lots of ducks around as this was by a lake.
There was also a 5kph road next to the said lake and bar, unfortunately a duck was run over right in front of us and was bleeding and looked as if it was dead as it had stopped moving.
This being said my partner jumped into action to see what we could do, at this point I thought there is nothing left to do but my partner started asking other passing cars to run the duck over again to make sure it was dead.
I said this isn’t fair to ask of other people and we started to walk back to the car.
She then said WE need to go back around and run the duck over again, to which I said I’m not comfortable doing that but you can go and do it and come and pick me back up.
Well all hell broke loose and she had what I can only describe as a meltdown, (this is not the first meltdown) she demanded me to get into the car on the count of 5, to which I said I will hop in the car when you calm down, she then proceeded to take of her engagement ring and through it onto the road and drive off.
She went and ran over the duck and came back to where I was but drove past and left me there, 30mins of trying to call with no answer.
 I should also mention that we were out of town at the time and it’s a 2 hour drive home.
After about an hour she eventually came back and picked me up and we drove home, arguing the way home.
I’m really torn here about if I did the right thing by not going to run the duck over again with her, she is saying she can’t trust me now to have her back.

9,1cl8yq0,AITA for someone leaving a DND session and saying I'm the reason?,"So, I'll try to keep this short, but as of a few nights ago, a member of a long term DND game I've been in for over a year left the party without any sort of warning and cited me as the main reason. There wasn't any sort of prior indicators about this. Before this, I though we were on good terms with each other, even if I wasn't nearly as close with him as with the other members (for my fellow DND players, you probably understand the difference between a friend and someone who you just play with but like)

His primary reasons were that I always spoke over him, purposely tried to keep him out of any type of roleplay, and was a cheater, and that he had called me out on this before but no one had ever done anything. He left no specific instances of any of these, and the rest of the party could offer none either. 

We're both very diffirant people, and our personalities clash a bit. He was always more quite and withdrawn at the game, where as I'm a bit of a louder player, and tend to have outbursts in moments where I get invested into whats going on in the campaign. Talking over people was an issue in the past for me, but its one I though I had gotten over, and another member of the party (by their own admission) does it frequently, yet they weren't mentioned at all. Given how quite they are, I think It could have been a problem that I just didn't pick up on. As a group, we generally go into long discussions about strategy and long term roleplay goals, and he often had a problem breaking into these conversations. Thats on us for not trying to include him, we should have tried, but I never tried to exclude him purposely, and it hurts me that he said that, as I was excluded in some of my first DND games.

The cheating thing, and more Importantly the calling me out thing, are completely unfounded. The Gm had no clue what he was talking about when I asked. One player commented that maybe I was doing something unintentional, but I doubt it.

I did try to reach out the next day to him, and admitadly sent a message to him that was half apology, half defense. It was along the lines of ""I'm sorry you felt this way, I should have been better, but your wrong about the cheating thing and the exclusion thing"" 

His response was, almost exactly ""Oh no, you misunderstand I have better things to do on my weekend then argue with children, this message is a waste of my time and dishonest, leave me alone"" 

Admitadly this pissed me off, but I didn't pursue the matter any further 

I have no intentions of trying to speak to him again, and I imagine its the same for him. But, I also worry that perhaps I've slipped into some old habits. Hoping some outside perspectives will help me sort this out, as I want to Improve if this is my fault. I don't want to be a problem at any tables. Admitaly I couldn't fit all the context I wanted within the character limit, so if any has questions I'm happy to answer

My dad has told me countless times that he is “heartbroken” because I have chosen such a small venue because he’s not able to invite all of his friends and family. He has referred to my and fiancé’s wedding as not just our wedding but their wedding as well.

13,1cl8e0i,AITA for moving out of my BF apartment and dumping him a week later?,"AITA 

I broke up with my (ex) boyfriend let’s call him Derick (27 male) about a week ago and this is how things went down. 

(He has a kid) 

About 6 months into our relationship I (22 female) had to move out of my apartment due to some financial issues. I was laid off and couldn’t afford rent as it was hard to find a job as an art teacher for some reason. One day I went over to my Derick’s place and vented about how I had to move back in with my parents. At this point he knew I did not have a good relationship with my father in Particular. Anyways while I’m venting he says “you could move in here.” I did initially tell him I didn’t know if that is a good idea and informed him that it would have to be temporary. Maybe 2-3 months max because I wanted to get my own place to get my dog back. I explained that I have a very large high energy dog that simply could not live in his apartment. He agreed to these terms. Even going as far as to say “even if you wanted to move out in a month you can I won’t make you live here.” 

Previous to this arrangement mentioned I told him due to some trauma I am not very into touch and mostly avoid it. I still would try my best to shelve those feelings of discomfort if he needed me to. He said that was fine. I also told him that I don’t like to talk about certain traumas. He said that is ok “I could talk about it when I felt ready.” I also made it clear that I’m able to “cut people off easily” not in like threatening way. I did explain that I just am able to move on and recover very quickly. And when I told him we were talking about our exes I didn’t just randomly tell him that to make him do anything. Anyways. 

A couple months later I get a call from a friend with a backyard and they offer me a room at their place. So I call up Derick and tell him: “hey I’ll be moving out soon BUT I will call and text and visit often. We can talk when you get home.” (No I did not mean I was moving out that day.) when he got home  He started getting weird and saying “how often is often” and when I said “I’m not sure yet” he says “you can’t just say often” I simply didn’t know yet. At this point I had just gotten a better job opportunity and had no idea what my schedule would be like. I tried reassuring him that I would let him know as soon as I DID get a schedule. Then he started trying to get me to stay by trying to convince me to bring my dog to his apartment. I repeated that I can’t and I told him I would be moving out months ago. He then said “you’re replacing me and my kid with a dog and a backyard” so I ended up leaving that same day as that felt like some kind of weird guilt trip and I wasn’t fucking with that… I told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a bit. But it wasn’t fair of him to say the things he did as I told him repeatedly throughout me living there I would move out eventually. 

He then messages me MULTIPLE times a day about how much I never loved him or his kid. And how I have a low EQ. And I left with only 6 hours notice And I’m shallow for not understanding why he’s upset. I explained I did understand but he didn’t listen. Our argument got more heated over the week and I ended up dumping him. He then said he was going to confront my father because he thinks my father is the reason I was “being disrespectful” I explained I was just pissed at him but he didn’t listen. 

He says he’s mad because he told he wouldn’t slow down in our relationship because he has a kid. Which he did. But again we were only 6 months into our relationship so I didn’t think it was fair to ask him to slow down. I asked him to again before we broke up I told him “I understand you have a kid and I’m not asking you to slow down his life or anything but I want to be in a good head space if you want me to be a mother to him. I need to slow down and fix my mental” but he said “my train can’t slow down so you’re either here or you’re not” which he claims isn’t an ultimatum. 

I began reciving texts like this (this is copy pasted no edits.) 

“You were never clear on your “boundaries” you said you don’t like touch but you came on to me when you were drunk. “ 

“I mean if you're actively wanting and initiating sex while drunk, I don't know, that isn't disinterest honey. I won't question your feelings, but your actions are strange considering. I'm not telling you who you are, I'm telling yOu WHAT YOU DO” 

Personally that sent me over the edge.


“I want you to really understand that that last message only reinforced my certainty that you actually are incredibly shallow.

I’m not sure how I was even supposed to answer that one. The last day we met in person before I dumped him I tried to call him and maybe explain things over one more time. He wouldn’t answer the phone and texted me”I’ll only talk to you face to face. I turned around and drove 3 hours back to his apartment. When I arrived he looked at me as if he was surprised I came and I said “I came all the way back to talk to you I drove 3 hours. So let’s talk. His response was. “it was your choice to come over” 

So I actually dumped him a full week after I moved out. In my previous post people thought I dumped him the day I moved and that’s simply not the case. I tried to communicate my feelings for a week. And he didn’t listen and tried to instead tell me how I was feeling. I told him I wasn’t going to leave him with rent if he needed help I would. I told him I’d still visit as much as I could (probably every day after school) and call him daily. But he said that I either wanted to “be there or not” so I chose to not. 

As far as his kid goes I also kept him in mind before I moved in. He knew me as the lady that  would hang out with dad and him. He called me mom one time I came to visit (before I moved in) I explained I wasn’t mom just someone that liked spending time with dad. Unfortunately the kid wasn’t around for a few months by the time I moved in. So I told Derrick if he found out his kid was moving back in with him I would also leave. Not to avoid the kid but because I didn’t want to start any confusion for the boy when I moved out. If I moved out before he came back I’d still be just the lady that lady to hang out with dad. 
 
He claims I didn’t communicate and I’m flaky and shallow. And afraid of commitment. I believe I communicated everything I said I would do but he acted surprised when I did… exactly what we agreed upon. 


So am I the a/hole? ",TL;DR,2024-05-06,"AITA for moving out of my BF apartment and dumping him a week later? AITA 

I broke up with my (ex) boyfriend let’s call him Derick (27 male) about a week ago and this is how things went down. 

(He has a kid) 

About 6 months into our relationship I (22 female) had to move out of my apartment due to some financial issues. I was laid off and couldn’t afford rent as it was hard to find a job as an art teacher for some reason. One day I went over to my Derick’s place and vented about how I had to move back in with my parents. At this point he knew I did not have a good relationship with my father in Particular. Anyways while I’m venting he says “you could move in here.” I did initially tell him I didn’t know if that is a good idea and informed him that it would have to be temporary. Maybe 2-3 months max because I wanted to get my own place to get my dog back. I explained that I have a very large high energy dog that simply could not live in his apartment. He agreed to these terms. Even going as far as to say “even if you wanted to move out in a month you can I won’t make you live here.” 

Previous to this arrangement mentioned I told him due to some trauma I am not very into touch and mostly avoid it. I still would try my best to shelve those feelings of discomfort if he needed me to. He said that was fine. I also told him that I don’t like to talk about certain traumas. He said that is ok “I could talk about it when I felt ready.” I also made it clear that I’m able to “cut people off easily” not in like threatening way. I did explain that I just am able to move on and recover very quickly. And when I told him we were talking about our exes I didn’t just randomly tell him that to make him do anything. Anyways. 

A couple months later I get a call from a friend with a backyard and they offer me a room at their place. So I call up Derick and tell him: “hey I’ll be moving out soon BUT I will call and text and visit often. We can talk when you get home.” (No I did not mean I was moving out that day.) when he got home  He started getting weird and saying “how often is often” and when I said “I’m not sure yet” he says “you can’t just say often” I simply didn’t know yet. At this point I had just gotten a better job opportunity and had no idea what my schedule would be like. I tried reassuring him that I would let him know as soon as I DID get a schedule. Then he started trying to get me to stay by trying to convince me to bring my dog to his apartment. I repeated that I can’t and I told him I would be moving out months ago. He then said “you’re replacing me and my kid with a dog and a backyard” so I ended up leaving that same day as that felt like some kind of weird guilt trip and I wasn’t fucking with that… I told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a bit. But it wasn’t fair of him to say the things he did as I told him repeatedly throughout me living there I would move out eventually. 

He then messages me MULTIPLE times a day about how much I never loved him or his kid. And how I have a low EQ. And I left with only 6 hours notice And I’m shallow for not understanding why he’s upset. I explained I did understand but he didn’t listen. Our argument got more heated over the week and I ended up dumping him. He then said he was going to confront my father because he thinks my father is the reason I was “being disrespectful” I explained I was just pissed at him but he didn’t listen. 

He says he’s mad because he told he wouldn’t slow down in our relationship because he has a kid. Which he did. But again we were only 6 months into our relationship so I didn’t think it was fair to ask him to slow down. I asked him to again before we broke up I told him “I understand you have a kid and I’m not asking you to slow down his life or anything but I want to be in a good head space if you want me to be a mother to him. I need to slow down and fix my mental” but he said “my train can’t slow down so you’re either here or you’re not” which he claims isn’t an ultimatum. 

I began reciving texts like this (this is copy pasted no edits.) 

“You were never clear on your “boundaries” you said you don’t like touch but you came on to me when you were drunk. “ 

“I mean if you're actively wanting and initiating sex while drunk, I don't know, that isn't disinterest honey. I won't question your feelings, but your actions are strange considering. I'm not telling you who you are, I'm telling yOu WHAT YOU DO” 

Personally that sent me over the edge.


“I want you to really understand that that last message only reinforced my certainty that you actually are incredibly shallow. Possibly slightly more deep than the average kiddie pool, but still just not that deep. I also want you to understand I needed you because I wanted you, and I no longer do. I sent that message this morning after rolling out of someone else's bed” 

I’m not sure how I was even supposed to answer that one. The last day we met in person before I dumped him I tried to call him and maybe explain things over one more time. He wouldn’t answer the phone and texted me”I’ll only talk to you face to face. I turned around and drove 3 hours back to his apartment. When I arrived he looked at me as if he was surprised I came and I said “I came all the way back to talk to you I drove 3 hours. So let’s talk. His response was. “it was your choice to come over” 

So I actually dumped him a full week after I moved out. In my previous post people thought I dumped him the day I moved and that’s simply not the case. I tried to communicate my feelings for a week. And he didn’t listen and tried to instead tell me how I was feeling. I told him I wasn’t going to leave him with rent if he needed help I would.

14,1cl87el,AITA for trying to get my boyfriend to lessen his addictions?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for close to 2 years. During this time, he has been addicted to video games, Dr. Pepper, and vaping. He admits that he's prone to addiction but doesn't think any of those three things are close to counting as such. 

Every day he wakes up, grabs a soda and immediately chugs it like he hasn't had access to anything to drink for weeks. Then he takes his vape off the charger and starts up a game. He usually plays solo, only playing with friends occasionally. He drinks about 6+ sodas a day and if he does less, he gets major headaches. I looked up the vape he has and it on average should last about a month, it lasts him 1 week, if that. 

I've explained how these things worry me (mainly the soda and vaping) and asked if he would be willing to slow down on them a bit. He said yes and we made a plan for him slowly decreasing on the sodas to start out. This worked for a couple months but he got such bad headaches and felt shitty all the time so he stopped trying. 

I asked if he would try to slowly stop vaping since the sodas didn't work. He believes that he likes vaping because of the sucking factor to it, not the nicotine. So I tried to find some alternatives and showed them to him. He said he'd try them but he hasn't done anything yet. He tried sucking on jolly ranchers for the oral fixation. He was convinced that was working but his vape still lasts the same amount of time. So now he's drinking sodas, vaping, and sucking on jolly ranchers all day.

I told him about my grandma who would refuse to drink anything but Coke Zero and it eventually took a toll on her. She had other health issues but the sodas made those health issues sky rocket and she ended up dying. I don't think me telling him that changed or affected him in any way.

He believes because his dad has done the same things his entire life, that he'll be fine doing them too. He'll say his dad is healthy so he'll be that way too. When his dad coughs, it sounds like he's dying. Just looking at his dad I can tell he's probably struggling more than he let's people see. My boyfriend refuses to see that and just makes jokes. He also believes that because he's not overweight, it's not negatively affecting him. He has so many health issues that I think could purely be solved by not drinking as many sodas anymore bit I could be wrong about that.

I'm genuinely worried about his health and I'm scared as to how these addictions will affect him in the future. Some of this makes him sound a bit like an asshole but he's just stubborn and doesn't want to accept how much everything is actually affecting him. I mentioned the gaming but it's really not that bad. He plays a lot but if I or anyone else asks him to get off, he immediately does. I also play with him sometimes.

15,1cl813v,AITAH during car shopping?,"My husband (32M) and I (33F) are currently on the hunt for a new vehicle, we are a single car household because he works from home and I am a housewife - there's zero reason to own 2 cars. I do 98.8% of the driving, even when we leave the house together I drive; his driving time is probably less than 6 hours per year. I contribute financially to the household by buying groceries, covering all expenses for our pets and upkeep on our current car (gas, oil changes, detail, tires, repairs) from my trust fund; he pays the rent and bills for those house and usually pays when we go out to dinner, this has always been the status quo. However we've decided to upgrade our current sedan to a mid sized suv and have been trying to find something that fits both of our tastes, which is difficult to say the least. 

We've already discussed and agreed he will be paying the car payment and insurance on the vehicle we purchase and I will continue to be responsible for the upkeep. He asked me for a list of 10 vehicles I would be interested in, 6 were crossed out with very little discussion; some were rather expensive, some were there to pad the list and act as ""well at least it's not this"" when it came to the one SUV I actually want that I know he's not a fan of. My top choice made the cut and yesterday we spent a few hours looking at and eventually test driving my vehicle of choice, a 2022 Dodge Durango R/T. My husband previously worked as a salesman for a chevy based dealer and is biased against basically anything that isn't a GM product but said he would keep an open mind. His only complaint about it was ""you can hear the outside wind from inside"" and that it's more expensive than the ""equivalent"" GM products on the list. (Equivalent is in quotes because while the GMs on the list are roughly the same size and features, the engines are all 4 and 6 cylinders - it's just not the same)

Here's where I may be the AH - This evening we were discussing our continued search as I had promised to keep an open mind while looking at other vehicles even though we both knew the durango had my heart. The conversation ended with him telling me I was being childish for wanting the durango because I like to go (not exceedingly) fast when it's safe to do so and I enjoy the sound of a tuned exhaust (beyond those two things, the durango is the size I like, has almost all the same features as our current vehicle, I find it attractive and it fits me well comfort wise). I promised him I would be open minded when we go to look at the other options on the list but I don't feel like he really held up his promise to be open minded about my choice.

And for weeks my mother has been sleeping in the living room instead of her own room. Each week she would say that she'll buy the bed bug spray, but something always came up as to why she couldn't. Now, she is back in her room and is claiming that she no longer has bed bugs. She ""starved"" them she says. 

This annoyed me. I wanted to get his bed bug problem taken care of as soon as possible. And now my mother just wants to sweep it under the rug? So I got the spray myself. I got the supplies. I watched the videos. I am committed to spray, however I have to clean this messy hosue first. I decided to start with my mother's room since she was working. I did this all the while knowing she would not be happy. I cleaned out her drawers, I cleaned out her closet, and I  got the stuff off the floor. I put it all in bags and threw it outside. I left important clothing like work clothes, undergarment, pajamas, etc in her room for her convenience.  This took me the entire day, and this is just one room. 

My mom came home from work and was shocked to see the state of her room. It was clean, but it was empty. This is what made her upset. She started reminding me that that she starved the bed bugs, and that she no longer has them. When she saw her empty closet (which was filled with clothes that she rarely wears), she started telling me that the bed bugs were not on hanging clothes. She said that I shouldn't have cleaned her room and took her stuff elsewhere without her. My sisters agreed, telling me that they would be upset too and that it was wrong for me to do it. 

I felt like I had to do this. My family isn't taking this seriously. My moms in denial, and my sisters are pessimistic that we will get this under control.  I figure if I start with my moms room then we would have to do the rest of the house. I already started it and there's no go back. I'm not doing this for us. I'm doing it for others. I do NOT want to give bed bugs to other people. Especially my dad. Only 30% of his heart is functioning and if he were to get beg bugs when we visit him then he would become stressed and have another heart attack. He probably wouldn't survive this one...this is why it's so important to me.

I found them very attractive, so I posted the Pictures with the guys on my close friends story and I wrote ; “ omg they are so cute like I am litteraly fangirling so hard rn!!!“. I then proceeded to post another story saying that I dm'ed one of guys (and maybe I shouldn’t have done that ) knowing damn well that I would not get a reply back. In said dm, I simply said that it was a pleasure meeting them and I hoped to see them again (Nothing too bad in my opinion…). Well Mateo Is on my close friends and saw both stories and got very upset. He replied to my story but then deleted his reply and unfollowed me. I always knew Mateo was very jealous but I thought that was a bit extreme. I tried dm'ing him but didn’t get a reply, so I deleted my message.

The next morning I got a text from Mateo saying that : I should’ve taken him off my close friends and that he didn’t need to see me crushing on other men. I then explained to him that they were celebreties and that it was innocent and that i wasn’t planning on doing anything with those guys. He explained to me that it didnt matter. I asked him to explain to me what bothered him but he refused to explain and told me he wished me the best and that i should enjoy the rest of my trip. Basically he decided to ”end it“ with me over that whole situation.

So, am In the wrong for what I did ?

I get it, rehoming pets should always be a last resort, and I do care about them, but I just dont have it in me to take care of them anymore, and my mom and dad definitely aren't willing. The only thing my mom is willing to do is yell at me when I suggest rehoming them. They're ""her babies"" and rehoming them is ""cruel"". I'd think it's crueler to make them stay in a home with an owner that doesn't want them.

They take up way too much space, and they're just not the kind of pet I want. I ASKED for a dog the year I got my first guinea pig. Obviously I've taken care of them all these years, but I've started to really hate it.

I get it, rehoming pets should always be a last resort, and I do care about them, but I just dont have it in me to take care of them anymore, and my mom and dad definitely aren't willing. The only thing my mom is willing to do is yell at me when I suggest rehoming them. They're ""her babies"" and rehoming them is ""cruel"". I'd think it's crueler to make them stay in a home with an owner that doesn't want them. 

I feel like it makes me a horrible person to feel this way, but I want them to be in a home that loves them and is willing to put in the immense amount of work to care for them.

19,1cl6mlv,AITA Charging rent to my brother after our grandfather passed and left the house to my 2 siblings and mother ,"Long story short 
Grandpa died , left his house to me, my 2 brothers and my mother. 
The split is: mom 45%, brother that reside in home 45% and 10% to other 2 siblings.
My grandpa passed 2 years ago and my brother had been living rent free for the last 14 years with him. 
We have told him that since the house now belongs to 4 people , if he wants to stay , he must pay rent to us which would be 55% of what the normal price would be to rent the home (since he owns 45%). 
He is spitting mad , are we the assholes or is it reasonable?


Context : 
The whole family lived in the house 20 years ago . Me and my younger sibling moved in with my mother and her boyfriend (they purchased a house) . 

My brother stayed and his girlfriend moved in. He had both his kids in that house. It a multi-generational home. 
He didn’t work for 15 of those 20 years. He was a stay at home dad. 
My grandad never charged him anything because he wanted to protect my brothers children and let them have a nice home that my brother never could if afforded otherwise. 
All renovation and everything but the cable was paid for by my grandfather. 
He now has a stable income , both kids are in high school. His girlfriend also works a good job in construction. 
Our goal is to either sell it or have I’m pay rent to the other inheritors. 
The issues is he doesn’t want to pays a fair price for his share , he wants to pay wayyy under market value because he says that he did some rénovation in the last 2 years and had a pool and a deck installed 3 years ago  ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-06,"AITA Charging rent to my brother after our grandfather passed and left the house to my 2 siblings and mother  Long story short

I took him to his word and would send him messages from time to time.

21,1cl6gf6,AITA for not wanting to leave the dorm so my roommate can spend time with his girlfriend. ,"Roommate came up to me today asking me today if he can have the room for a couple hours, so he can spend time with his girlfriend. I don't believe there is no problem with this, but he always ask me to leave the room past 8 and up to 11 or 12. I made it clear to him that I'm not okay with this because I like to have the room right before I go to sleep, and I have to wake up on weekdays at 6:30. 

Due to this, I was confused why he was asking me to leave the room at such a late time when I made this fact clear in the past. I guess I stared at him looking confused, so he complained to me that I never leave the room this quarter. In which my defense, I'm super busy due to taking more credits and taking up an internship which he knows, which makes most of my free time and weekend in door studying or sleeping. He kept on ranting that it's common courtesy to leave the room when I have left the room multiple times, so he can spend time with his girlfriend in the past two quarter when asked to. He also brought up that he never gets the room and he leaves so I could the room alone which baffled me because he's the one always leaving the room alone to me because he doesn't like studying near me inside the dorm.

22,1cl6dzu,AITA for telling my dad that I'm still traumatized from my past to the point where I don't even want to talk to him anymore.,"My childhood was not so great of my mother. My dad was the one who pretty much salvaged my childhood until I was around 12 years old. The company my dad worked at gave him a promotion. That promotion meant more responsibilities in that role. Because of that promotion, he was more stressed out and less motivated to do things like do any father-son time that we used to do. Before, he would spend at every other weekend with the guys (his friends), and the promotion slowly made it to where he spent every weekend with the guys. This bothered me because I looked forward to our father-son time. When I talked to him about that and his response was always, ""I will this weekend, I promise,"" and then I put two and two together and realized he was never going to give me the time of day so I gave up.  
Just one year later, he got another promotion which meant not only less time with him, but he got irate. One of his friend's sons was a bully of mine in grade school. He liked this friend and liked his kid so he got pissed off with me because I made a fuss about it. Then I stood to my bully to which my dad did not like. He got furious that I stood up to him. I could no longer see my dad for what he used to be after that event. Then I turned 18 and left. Through most of my adulthood, he made zero effort in trying to get to know me and try to become a part of my life, because he believed I was ""too old"" for his love so I gave up and moved on.  
Ten years later, he decided he wanted to make an effort out of nowhere. Part of me still wanted to love my dad so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. And sure enough he did make the effort. Not a lot, but enough to assure that I had someone to fall back on if I ever needed anything. I appreciated that, but the problem is that I can't get over what he did to me. His response was to forget about it and move focus on what he have now, and I just can't.  
I went to see him this afternoon as I was invited for a BBQ. I told him at the BBQ that I am still bothered by the past. He did not take that well and told me to focus on he's doing now to make things better instead. I told him I can't help what I feel. There's a huge gap missing and that gap was filled with horrible memories of you. I told him I can't get over the things he did to me. He, of course, told me if I had just one day with his old man I'd see things differently.  
Admittedly, his old man was a monster and there was a reason why I only saw him twice. Regardless, I told him it wasn't a competition on who had it worse as he did horrible things to me and I can't get over that. He told me that he doesn't know what else he can do to make things better and I excused myself.

23,1cl6d03,WIBTA for asking a kid to pay damages for hitting my car,"Yesterday morning a kid ran into my car with their bike and left a mark on it. I noticed the mark and checked our security camera, which is how I know what happened. It looks like there were a couple of grade school kids going by, one of them drove one of the younger ones off the side of the road into our car.

 I also have grade-school kids going to the same school, we live in a small residential area so it wouldn’t be hard to identify the kid who ran into my car by asking my own kids and looking/asking around. My husband and I are considering doing so and then asking them to just pay the cost of fixing the damage. WIBTA for pursuing this?

I have my own kids, I know they’re not always careful and I’m inclined to give some grace for mistakes, and 3. my husband is much more concerned about our car and cars in general than me, I personally don’t even care about a mark or a scratch, so it feels just mean-spirited and arbitrary go after someone for money (my husband feels more strongly).",Asshole,2024-05-06,"WIBTA for asking a kid to pay damages for hitting my car Yesterday morning a kid ran into my car with their bike and left a mark on it.

29,1clxzdl,AITA for going off on my teacher?,"I (14F) am in Spanish 2. My teacher is very disorganized, she changes the homework assignment at least 8 times in any given class period. It is never clear what the homework is, in our class of 15. At least 5 students at any given time didn’t do the homework, because nobody really knows what it is. In addition, she oftentimes gives 4+ worksheets a night, which is kind of a large workload considering how long the worksheets are. During class the next day, she always goes over the homework and whomever didn’t complete it is sent into the hallway for about 25 minutes while she goes over it (half of the kids who remain in the room usually tend to get sent out because they either didn’t finish or they’re trying to get away with copying some of the answers in hopes of not failing or having our parents contacted). She doesn’t really teach, she just hands us huge packets of worksheets and tells us when the test is.

Anyways, today I got sent out in the hall with a few other kids and she starts yelling at me telling me that “this lazy nonsense needs to stop” and how I go to school and need to complete schoolwork. She then aggressively grabs my packet and starts flipping through and yells at me for not completing something that was “in-class work” (i worked my hardest on it but she only gave us like 5 minutes to do it and I forgot to finish it over the weekend). She threatened to contact my parents and told me that it was the last day of this nonsense.

I got frustrated and I told her that it’s not our faults that she is never clear about what the homework is and that we have lives outside of school. I mentioned how stressed I am with my other classes and how I am working hard on practicing for colorguard and practicing my instrument which I am trying to get good at. I said that the amount of work she gives is ridiculous and that she forgets that this isn’t our only class.

Anyways, I think I made her a little upset and yeah. I’m starting to feel like I may be in the wrong but she was pushing me over the edge, I haven’t been the first one to go off on her. She’s a source of anxiety for many of her students.

31,1clxsg6,AITA for planning a vacation without my mother?,"I (f21) and my mom (f60s) have an interesting relationship. Somedays we are best friends, and other days I am the worst thing that has ever happened to her.

  
Growing up, we were lower middle class and did not have much money for vacations. If we did travel, it was to Florida. Our trips to Florida included visiting her extended family, a majority of whom are now in jail, and sitting in a hotel room watching TV because she wanted to ""relax"". This is not, nor has ever been my ideal vacation. Once my brother turned 16, he stopped going on these trips and my father eventually did as well. 

Since December all my mother has been talking about is wanting to go on vacation this summer. I have a full-time job and a good income, and I have 2 weeks in August that I can take off, so I was more than open to the idea of going on a vacation. 

The thing is, I wanted to go somewhere new, potentially to California or Colorado, or even Maine, but my mom just wants to go to Florida again and ""relax"". I have expressed to her multiple times that I am not interested in spending my money to sit in a hotel in Florida when we are from New Jersey and I can just spend a weekend at the beach here or visit my friends in Virginia. 

For about 2 months, every time I suggested going somewhere other than Florida, the conversation always circled back to Florida or it was shut down. A few weeks back she agreed to a road trip to Colorado, but the minute I started to make actual plans, she decided it would be ""too hot there so we should go to Florida instead"". So, I talked to a few of my friends and planned a trip to Virginia with them instead. 

Yesterday my mom mentioned how she was so excited to go to Florida this summer to my aunt while on the phone, and after she hung up she came over to me and asked me if I had booked the hotel yet. I told her that I hadn't because I was not going to Florida with her. 

She started crying because I ""am selfish"" and ""don't care about her"", but I just want to take a vacation that is not a poorly air-conditioned room in the closest place to hell on Earth.

32,1clxrri,AITA for how my relationship ended ,"This is a long story but ill try to sum it up as much as possible. 

So basically my ex and I got engaged in July. In August my ex became jealous of a good friend of mine and mistook me saying ""estoy in mi casa amor""(im home love) as a sign that I was cheating on her. I absolutely was not i call everyone love or sweetie or babes due to working in the service industry. I just didnt understand the intention behind saying love in spanish versus English. Anyway after that we started crumbling. We tried to make things work for about a month but things with us were just deteriorating. She moved into the spare bedroom in september and we decided we would continue out the remainder of our lease then seperate. Things were amicable until October. 

She decided she wanted to get back together so we started dating again, she moved back into our room. However she was already seeing someone else and didn't cut them off when we started trying again. She never broke up with me after we decided to get back together in September. She would just disappear and go see the other woman sometimes for days at a time and lying about being at her friends house. At this point we are fighting avery single time she is home. 

So January comes around and i get intouch with the other woman and tell her everything. My ex had obviously lied to her and told her we were broken up and I was her roommate but that was a lie, we were still sleeping in the same bed. This woman is obviously upset about finding out she is especially a homewrecker. My ex got angry that I talked to her side piece and that causes even more trouble. The other woman did not stop talking to my ex. Infact in August they will have been engaged a year and my ex and I slept together for the last time April 27th. But anyway after I call her we fight worse than we ever had and my ex assaults me one night. I wont go into heavy details but she hit me for almost 10 minutes before I even so much as whimpered or began to fight back. 

At this point i am mentally drained, my life had been ripped out from underneath me, I was being emotionally abused and knowingly strung along for 7 months. And my ex was mean. Going as far as to insult my deceased mother out of anger. She would scream at me that I'm a useless waste of space, wouldn't finish school and that I was going to ruin every kid I worked with (im an RBT). She would throw all of my biggest insecurities in my face just to get me upset. She turned my phone off twice and left horrible mean notes on my car and just put me through the ringer mentally.

 I was not 100% innocent I would blow up her phone with multiple numbers she would block me and I would flip.It made me go absolutely crazy. I had to watch my fiancée activitly leave me for another woman. I had to cry and grieve our 3 years relationship by myself while she just got to move on with no consequence. I had to live through having my emotions played with and used against me in a way that was almost sinister in nature. Meanwhile they just laughed about me being ""crazy"" when It was the actions that they put me through that pushed me to act in a way I normally would not. I want to add in too that from January to april when they were supposedly ""official"" my ex slept with/got back with me/cheated on the other woman a total of 4 times and that woman still chose to propose. So I want to know am I the asshole?

I 23(F) and my so 24(M) have been together two years and he grew up with a tough upbringing.

One of the eldest siblings recently reached out, saying she would like to come visit and bring her 3 children because she is “off work for the entire month of June” this is where the first flag trickled upwards. She isn’t an educator, pilot, or in any field where she would get that much time off of work in the summertime. Hmm. Okay, I’m probably just tripping, continued to listen to him reading the texts. He then tells her, “well I live with my SO who is currently pregnant and will be 6 months at the time of your visit. We live in a 700sqft apartment so it would be a tight squeeze if you 4 are here plus my girlfriend, my other 2 children and I.” She then responds with “I AM YOUR SISTER, so that SHOULDNT MATTER.” Alright, he has never met this woman.

so for context. I live with my grandmother, aunt, and 2 cousins. I wouldn’t say we struggle too much, but we have our ups and downs.

My cousins dad has been paying for their food ever since he broke up with their mom (my aunt).

Now here’s where I may sound like the asshole.

I was cooking lunch for myself, my grandmother, who was sat in the kitchen had told me to cook extra for my cousins. I said, “No, because their dad is already buying them lunch and dinner”. She told me to still cook just in case, I then told her again, “no, it’d be a waste of food because their dad is already buying them food and they won’t be able to finish the food I cooked for them.”

By that point she got angry and said I was being selfish, but their dad practically buys them food everyday and I have to look for something to eat (and sometimes wound up not being able to eat since we run out of groceries). 


You could question why don’t they just buy me food in turn, to that my answer is that their dad or mom doesn’t care if I’m fed. As long as my 2 cousins have food they could care less if I had any groceries left. 

My grandmother sends me out to get groceries, but by then my cousins will literally stack it all up for themselves and I’m left with nothing and get scolded if I take something from their rooms. 

I said no to my grandmother only because we had just gotten this months groceries and tend to run out in the middle of the month and barely make it by for next month. In saying no this food could last ME far longer compared to if I just cooked more for my cousins when their dad has already said he’s buying their food.

A really good friend of mine Jen (not her real name for privacy reasons) have been friends for probably about 2-3 years and share a lot of common interests. I live in the USA and it's almost summer where I live, so the school year is coming to an end. My grade is having an end-of-year field trip to a safari waterpark-amusement park type thing. Honestly I've never been to it before and it's going to be a really nice trip.

I paid for the trip super late since I kept forgetting and procrastinating (my fault) and my friend group (including Jen) wanted to be with a certain chaperone, which had a list you had to write your name on. I had previously expressed to Jen that I wanted to be in this certain chaperone's group and she wanted to be in another chaperone's group, which I was perfectly fine with. 

Fast forward to a few weeks, and I finally pay. I got to school late and I didn't have time to put my name on the chaperone paper. There was one spot left and my other friends Hayley and Keira (not their real names for privacy reasons) tried to save my spot for me along with Jen. Hayley and Keira later told me that they tried to stop Jen from signing up in ""my spot"" since they were reserving it for me. But she signed up anyway and said ""womp womp"" which to me, was rude.

36,1clwwgo,AITAH for setting a boundary about assuming my reasoning?,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I m24 have been in a relationship with my girlfriend 24f for 2 years. I’ve noticed a trend in the past couple arguments we’ve had. After finding out about my rough upbringing, she started using it to discredit my argument/explain my point of view. 

For example, recently we had an argument about what can be reasonably expected from either of us. She had said she would do something for me (non-sexual) that was time sensitive, but forgot. I got annoyed because it’s not the first time this has happened. I pointed out the pattern (albeit in frustrated but not aggressive way), and she said that I’m feeling this because of my past trauma.

The trauma I shared with her was nowhere near related to this. It was about neglect rather than people breaking their word. I haven’t felt that way about anyone “breaking promises” except her. She never promised, and I’m not saying she should.  I’m ok with her breaking her word once in a while, since I know it’s not on purpose. But I also think she should take responsibility when it does happen. Instead, she blames me taking it personally due to a trauma I never experienced, asserting she knows better about what my reasoning is or what’s going on in my head.

For context, she’s studying psych as an undergrad, and in arguments she frequently brings up “I’ve seen studies on _____” 
when _____ is only tangentially related to the subject. She has taken it personally when I point this out, or when I say that she doesn’t know my reasons and shouldn’t assume. She does this even when I clearly state my reasoning and point of view. 

When things have escalated, I’ve called her an “armchair psychologist”, which I agree is over the top and aggressive, but the sentiment is valid right? If you’re going to bring up studies or theories, they should be applicable. Same with assuming my reasons. She only knows what I’ve told her so how can she state that for sure it’s related to my background? 

She used the example of “say you’re in a coffee shop, and see a pair of people sitting close together. You can form an opinion on whether they’re dating, or friends. Why is it different to do it with someone’s background?”  Whereas I think unless there’s evidence or an obvious tell(like kissing) people shouldn’t assume that their snap judgement is correct.


TLDR: girlfriend makes assumptions about why I think or feel the way I do, especially in arguments to discredit me. I put up a boundary saying that she has no right to make those assumptions, especially when I clearly state my point of view. She thinks it’s unreasonable for me to “tell her what to do and think” and that everyone forms judgements about people even when they’re  unsure or it’s “just a feeling” and they can be assumed to be true until proven otherwise.

I m24 have been in a relationship with my girlfriend 24f for 2 years. I’ve noticed a trend in the past couple arguments we’ve had. After finding out about my rough upbringing, she started using it to discredit my argument/explain my point of view. 

For example, recently we had an argument about what can be reasonably expected from either of us. She had said she would do something for me (non-sexual) that was time sensitive, but forgot. I got annoyed because it’s not the first time this has happened. I pointed out the pattern (albeit in frustrated but not aggressive way), and she said that I’m feeling this because of my past trauma.

The trauma I shared with her was nowhere near related to this. It was about neglect rather than people breaking their word. I haven’t felt that way about anyone “breaking promises” except her. She never promised, and I’m not saying she should.  I’m ok with her breaking her word once in a while, since I know it’s not on purpose. But I also think she should take responsibility when it does happen. Instead, she blames me taking it personally due to a trauma I never experienced, asserting she knows better about what my reasoning is or what’s going on in my head.

37,1clwroe,AITA for “starving” and “kicking out” my friends?,"Hi reddit first time poster here,

yesterday for my bday i had 3 friends over to stay the night, one friend ill call ella showed up 2 hrs late and she showed up high which I had explicitly told her not to do as my family would be there for the party but i decided to let it go and offered her food and drink which she declined stating she wasn't hungry (she actually did eat some of the food i left for her)

Immediately after she came her and my friend jack complained about wanting to go inside so we did 

As soon as we got upstairs jack and ella started asking if the 3 of us could get high (4th friend doesnt smoke) i said no and explained my family was there and i didnt want to do that as i dont rily like doing it because it makes me feel anxious. I explicitly told them not to smoke in my house. about 10 minutes late i said i was going to get changed and when i came back they were both acting weird and it turns out they just started smoking and getting high while i was in the bathroom.

For the next 2 hours or so i was completely ignored by Jack and ella. at around 9 i went downstairs to watch the f1 race with my friend who wasnt high.

About 10-20 minutes in Jack sends me a message asking if i was mad at them and i expressed that i was because the didnt respect my boundaries and didnt the one thing i asked them not to, he began calling me immature and rude and said i was making a big deal over nothing.

I gave up arguing and then i get a text of him asking for food and when i brought up a bowl of snacks he told me it wasnt good enough and how he wanted bread, i told him we didnt have anything and that i didnt think we even had food in the house because we hadnt done the shopping.

They than began posting to their stories about how i was starving them while they were holding cans of coke and you could see the big bowl of snacks i had left just for them. Eventually they started bothering my parents for food.

i ignored all this and when up to my room but stopped to use the bathroom first, this is where i heard them shit talking me for a full 10 minutes and so at that point i gave up and just slept on the couch.

when i woke up Ella was about to go so i just let her leave without saying anything, Jack had said yesterday that he would leave about the same time as ella but 40 mins had passed and nothing, i then get texts from him just honestly being vile and calling me a bad friend so i got fed up went up stairs and told him to get the fuck out of my house

He wasnt even dressed when i got up there. this at was about 11-11:30 am. After he left Jack and Ella told a lot of our friends i starved them and kicked Jack out.

38,1clwqpo,AITA for not letting my housemate’s girlfriend do beauty treatments on other people out of our home?,"She does botox, filler, and other beauty injections for a living, and is certified/trained/licensed/whatever regulations are required in her home country, but not here. 

She wants to start doing these procedures out of our house, and I’m uncomfortable with it. She may have the skills, but she is not legally authorized to do them here. The materials she uses are obtained in her home country and smuggled into this one, because she cannot buy them here without being a practitioner.

I don’t really care what she does to herself or my housemate or her clients, but I don’t want a bunch of people I don’t know coming to our house for back alley botox. I’m also concerned that by hosting these unlicensed procedures, we could be opening ourselves up to liability if something goes wrong. AITA?

Edited to add additional insight into why I might be the AH:
- She does not have another place she can easily do these procedures, unless another friend or family member lets her use their home. 
- It doesn’t really harm me in any real way, and maybe I’m just being paranoid and overbearing. 
- Presumably her clients know the risks, probably nothing will go wrong, and they probably wouldn’t sue, so maybe I’m making much ado about nothing. 
- It makes her life inconvenient and potentially more expensive to have to do the beauty procedures elsewhere. 
- My housemate thinks I’m the asshole because I would feel bad if he tried to tell me I couldn’t have my friends over for beauty treatments. I told him if I wanted to have friends over to do waxing and he wasn’t comfortable with it in the house, we would do it somewhere else. We would probably laugh at him for being silly, but it isn’t a big deal to do it somewhere else. 

2nd edit:

Does it make a difference if she’s “just doing it for friends and family”? I assume she’s getting paid regardless of who she’s injecting, and that even if she doesn’t CALL them clients, it’s still a client-provider relationship because money is being exchanged. I’m being told I’m being unreasonable and have a “difference of interpretation.”

3rd edit (sorry): ~~u/NoodlesTheGreat53 noted that it is possible to buy botox and fillers over the counter from reputable Korean sources in the US. I did not know this, and thought botox, fillers, blood plasma stuff, and etc. had to be done by a licensed professional to be legal. Noting it here because I don’t want to unfairly bias or mislead people.

39,1clwq2r,WIBTA If I told my step dad I don't want his friend to decorate my moms Birthday cake,"First time poster! Sorry if anything is incoherent, I wrote all this on my phone.

I (23F) am a cake decorator at a grocery store bakery, I learned to decorate almost three years ago from two amazing cake decorators, I also bake and cake decorate from home. 

My aunt's and uncles have celebrated their 50th birthday over the last couple years and I have been the one to do their cakes for their 50th birthdays and I absolutely love doing it.. it gives me more practice with my baking from home with different flavors. I also should mention that I do not charge them for the cakes I make, neither for the supplys I use.

So here's the issue, my Mom is going to be turning 50 in 5 months and I was already thinking of ideas for her cake, I was thinking of doing 50 photos of her on the cake for every year she's been alive. My step dad (let's call him John (60)) and I were talking about cakes and he said ""oh you won't have to worry about Moms cake, Mandy's going to do it)"".

Mandy (58) is Johns friends girlfriend and she is a cake decorator too but has a small cake business where she pretty much works from home and has many more years of experience.
John also had Mandy decorate a cake for my grandma  (on my mom's side) 80th birthday this past year, I was sad about not being able to do my Grandma's birthday cake but I put my feelings to the side since I know he placed an order for it way ahead of time.

I know he really likes Mandy's decorating, he is always talking about he cakes and my parents buy butter in bulk when they are on sale for her. I think he sees my decorating as inferior to hers.
I was hurt he didn't think I would want to do my mom's cake or maybe couldn't do as good a job as Mandy but I feel like it would mean more to my mom if I did her cake. My family, when I did each of their cakes, all asked me to do their 50 year cakes and I know many of them have friends who are also cake decorators but they still asked me to do the cakes because it meant more coming from their niece.

So  WIBTA If I told my step dad I don't want his friend to decorate my moms Birthday cake because I would like to do it myself. 
I don't know if my mom specifically asked to have Mandy do her cake or if it was a decision John made on his own, I worry my mom could possibly have been the one to request the cake to be made by Mandy, and If she did, then I want her to have the cake Mandy makes because I don't want to make her birthday not so good because I made this one issue all about me, but if she didn't, then I feel like I should be the one to make it.

40,1clwfb9,AITA for mentioning my financial problems to my boyfriend?,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost 7 years, and he recently even proposed to me. During this past year, he has been living in Jacksonville helping out his family and I'm living alone in Miami as I was waiting for him to come back. He was hired as a manager over there and now makes triple than what I make down here despite having two jobs, and I was recently fired from my second job. Prior to this, we lived together for two years and I paid for our apartment deposits in two moves and also paid rent for him once for three months when he was unemployed and on another occasion when he was making 9 dollars an hour and was fired the next day with nowhere to live. For the next couple of years, I was often the primary bread-maker and paid the majority of our rent and also lived with many of his family members and also paid for them on some occasions when they couldn't afford our rent.

Fast foward to the present- his sister recently died and a month later his father died; both due to terminal and complicated illnesses. I flew up on both occasions and was with his family for a week during both losses despite not having a dime in my pocket, and did everything possible to focus on them and not speak of my problems and financial struggles.

This past month, I only had enough money for rent and had days where I didn't eat, ate my coworker's leftovers, or my elderly father would pay for food from my local cafeteria so I could eat a proper meal, and wouldn't even have enough money to pay for an Uber to get to work unless my manager gave me a ride. Despite all this, I never asked for money from anyone, especially from him.

My job, despite asking for a raise for a month and a half, sent $980 this week as my paycheck-300 dollars less than what I make. I sent him a screenshot of what I was given at work, and immediately upon seeing it, he said that he wasn't going to help me because I am giving him emotional stress.

Granted, I am aware that he just lost his father a month ago and lost his sister two months ago so perhaps I have been self centered by telling him about what's going on or have not given him as much support as he would have liked.

43,1clw8w7,AITA for not wanting to attend my brother’s wedding because and for calling my SIL rules stupid? ,"Im 27F dentist and my brother 32M and his soon wife 27F are getting married in less than 2 months. Let’s call my SIL Abby. Abby and I never had a relationship of our own. We definitely don’t hate each other but we are not besties. We just exist in each others presence.
I noticed that in the invitation to their weeding that Abby requested the dress code to be all women in the wedding to wear off the shoulder dresses, suits or anything just off the shoulder. Doesn’t matter the color or the sequence unless it is off the shoulder.

Now as I said I am a dentist and as many people already know dentists may not have the best back/shoulder posture ever. And Im not an exception and I always tend to wear outfits that do not emphasize that part of my body.  Now the type of clothing this dress code demands needs someone with a good back posture because that’s the emphasis. I totally lack that and yes I did try one dress of the shoulder on looked absolutely horrendous.

So I asked if I the dress code is really that important and if I have to abide it but my brother told me Abby stressed on this dress code so much. And Abby was like if she “leeways” me she has to leeway everyone (I was kinda baffled that so much importance was placed on a certain type of clothing with no explanation given) 

I went with my friend shopping hoping I’d find one that I looked not so clownery in. I tried on so many different fits, looked like shit in all of them. So I told my mother since they are so attached to that dress code then I think the best option here for me is to not go. So I wouldn’t ruin their organization and I wouldn’t have nightmares about how awful I looked in that event. But my mum got mad at me and said Im being dramatic for not wanting to be there for brother and family just for a dress. I told her I want to attend but I also want to look good and feel pretty and they are sticking to such a stupid rule that they can’t provide a meaning. Regardless I respected that and decided not to ruin their image of how they want their wedding. My mum said my absence will also ruin things because the guests will wonder why the sister is not attending when Im healthy. I told her well the guests will also wonder why I look like I could be the guy of hunchback Notre Dam (okay Im not that bad but you get the gist here) My mum is still mad at me (haven’t told my brother and SIL yet)",Not the A-hole POO Mode,2024-05-06,"AITA for not wanting to attend my brother’s wedding because and for calling my SIL rules stupid?

45,1clv1su,AITA for what I said to my mom,"  Hi all! Im not sure if this is even a serious situation or Im just having the most basic 17 year old girl feelings but bascially for context, We went on vacation to Florida where we rented this electric car, so we had to find charging stations. So we get to this charging station and it says we have to download an app, and I tell my mom this. She gets annoyed and calls customer service or some shit, and then she asks a guy for help and he says we have to download an app. So then I finally just download the app and our car starts charging. 

  I’m pissed at this point becuase it took 2 different people for her to just listen to me. And I told her that I hate when she treats me like I’m stupid and I can’t do anything. She says “I never called you stupid” and I was like “no i never said you called me stupid I said you make me feel like I’m stupid.” And then she goes “you’re so dramatic I never do that” and then I bring up how she has been making feel this way for years. And how whenever I bring up any issue she does she either denies it, undermines it and gives some halfass apology or tells me to shut up and move on. 

  So I start telling her that’s she’s been making me feel this way for years and she starts acting like I’m crazy. I bring up how she treats me emotionally and how she legit use to beat me as a kid. She gets offended and just denies denies and denies. Eventually she says that we will have nothing to do with eachother and that I should move out at 21 and get over it. But she always does this. She always undermines the issues I tell her. Another issue today was that she neglected to charge the car and it ended up losing battery. So I got frustrated cause I feel like I have to do everything. And that my parents never read. So I said they’re incompetent and that I hate going anywhere with them because of this. And they just kept laughing at me. And trying to say because I wasn’t very good at Spanish that they were laughing at something else Like I can’t speak Spanish or some shit and I was just miss hearing them.

47,1clup33,WIBTA for canceling on a concert after we bought tickets? ,"My BF & I have been dating for 5 months. One of his friends (Nick) has a girlfriend (Sienna). My BF scheduled a double date to introduce us. My first impression of Sienna was she was verbally abusive towards Nick. She was making fun of him for being “old”, “boring“,  shoving her hands in his face when she didn’t like what he was saying. I felt like she was very abrasive, & the things she brought up during lunch were inappropriate to say around other people.

After this lunch date, Sienna reached out to me and asked me to go to a concert with her. She said she had a hard time making friends and was socially awkward. So in order to be open to new people and give her second chance, I agreed to go the concert bought a ticket and booked a hotel.

Prior to the concert date was a mutual friend’s wedding. 1 hr prior to the ceremony Nick called saying that Sienna needed help with her hair. She made a last-minute appt and needed to leave it 1/2 dry to be on time. Sienna had spent about $100 on this hairdo and had taken it all out in a sort of emotional breakdown. If we helped we would be late, so my BF and I apologized for not being able to help. 

We ended up showing up to the ceremony exactly on time. Nick and Sienna were delayed and had to sneak in the back. When we greeted them later, it felt as though Nick had some resentment towards us due to our inability to help with this last minute problem. (Since we arrived on time). During the cocktail hour and reception, Sienna was aloof, pouty and very nonresponsive to questions. She didn’t really greet us or say much of anything. I tried to engage her a bit, but she was just very flat. She was so upset with her situation she ultimately sat in the car during nearly the entire reception. Nick had to try and deal with that situation while trying to be present at the wedding. You could tell that Nick was frustrated with Sienna and the situation. After the wedding Nick invited us over to have drinks at his hotel pool and Sienna stayed in the room. 

Nick and my BF made plans the next morning to have lunch. I was hoping this would give Sienna time to calm down, regroup, and redeem herself. We agreed to meet at 11:30. My BF and I arrived right on time then Nick texted my BF they were going to be 30min late. 45 minutes goes by before they show up. Again, Sienna had nothing to say and sat in silence during the entire meal. She didn’t even say hello and didn’t say goodbye either.

The concert with Sienna is coming up soon for a band that she likes (that I have never heard of). The concert is 3hrs away and I already bought a ticket that was under $50. I also found out she invited another person (even though she prefaced her invite saying she didn’t have anyone to go with).

48,1cluoza,WIBTA if I sold presents that a friend gave me?,"I (20M) have been given an absurd amount of plushies from my partner's sister (21F) over the past fees years I've been living in their household.
My partner and I don't have a place of our own and share a pretty small bedroom together, with barely accessible closet space as that's where most of our storage is. A majority of our storage stuff is plushies and other stuffed animals and toys. While some of it is from our childhoods or dates we've been on and hold sentimental value, most of our plushies come from my partner's sister.
She has an obsession with plushies and stuffed animals and loves to spend most of her paychecks on them whenever she can. Her room is covered wall to wall with different plushies, and her bed is buried in them and it's honestly concerning. Not necessarily that she likes collecting them, but that she dosn't have the room or upkeep of them to truly have the space for more.
Because she loves plushies so much she frequently gifts medium sized to large carnival sized plushies and toys to other family members. I could understand it (maybe) if the plushies were related to our interests or even our favorite animals or such, but they often have no correlation to us aside from they look cute and she wants us to have cute things. I think she believes that because she likes them, them everyone must enjoy them too. I don't hate plushies mind you, but my plushies and toys either hold great emotional meaning to me or are based on the interests I have (the latter of which I end up buying myself).

The thing is, we don't have any more room for those sorts of presents, and I've had to tell other people I know that they cannot longer gift even smaller plush objects to me because of the ungodly amount that our room already has. We have no more room and are bursting at the seems because of these huge plushies that we have no fucking space for. We've had to keep some out of our closet because there isn't enough room for them, and our room is slowly starting to look like my partner's sisters 1 because two people are sharing a one person space and 2 because of the sheer size and volume of the plush toys we have now. I want so desperately to sell the toys that my partner's sister gave us, make a bit of cash while also clearing out storage space for other things (like out of season winter clothes, crafting supplies, sentimental or breakable items, etc), but I'm worried that it would be inconsiderate and rude, especially because I was just gifted a handful this past Christmas and on my birthday, and I don't want my partner's sister to be mad or upset that we aren't keeping them. The pushies don't mean anything to me because they aren't based on anything that I enjoy, and they weren't gifts with lots of thought behind them, but clearly my partner's sister thinks that it's a good gift.

49,1clujkf,AITA for pulling out of a band and avoiding all the band members ,"I (22F) and 4 of my friends, (let's call them Viv, Kay, CJ and Nik) formed a band when we were around 15-16 years old. Viv's dad had seen our talent and gave us the idea to start a band and even bought instruments. He fully supported us, helping us practice and through connections with some of his pals, got us opportunities to play publicly. Recently Viv's dad passed and we all decided to continue the band in his honor.

At first everything was okay. We continued playing out as usual, still practicing, Nik and I even wrote a song together to honor Viv's dad. Then suddenly Viv stopped showing up to practice. I considered that they were still grieving over their dad. A month had passed and still there was no sign of Viv. When I called, I was told that they were ""busy"". I didn't think anything of it, as they continued to ask about what the band was doing in their absence.

One day, we had learned that a more well known band had pulled out of a concert, and we were going to play instead. We were ecstatic. With this chance we could gain more recognition. Everyone continued practicing, still no Viv. Finally the day of the concert arrived, and I was driving to the place where the concert was being held, a 3 hour drive. I was 3/4 of the way there, when my phone rang. It was Viv's mom telling me that the rest of the group had decided not to go. Shocked, I told her that I was almost there, and it was unprofessional for us to cancel last minute. She had told me that Viv decided not to go and told the rest of the group not to as well. 

I pulled over near a gas station to recollect my thoughts and immediately asked to talk to Viv. I asked them why they would cancel last minute and tell everyone not to go too. Viv said it was their call whether or not we went to the concert. I pointed out that they didn't tell me this, and told them that I was almost there, to which Nik (probably in the room) responded, ""Well, that's her problem if she left already."" I was horrified when I heard this, as I had been friends with these people for 16 years. I pleaded with them to at least show up to the concert to be professional, and that we could talk about this afterwards. CJ took the phone, told me to go f*** myself and hung up.

When I went home that night I cried in my bedroom for hours. Eventually I realized that these people were unprofessional and immature, and that group would not be beneficial for my goals. Yesterday I called V's mom to tell her I was pulling out of the group. Viv's mom understood and didn't try to stop me. I have blocked the rest of the group on all social media. My sister told me that I was an AH for just pulling out and not even waiting to speak with Viv.

Yesterday I called V's mom to tell her I was pulling out of the group. Viv's mom understood and didn't try to stop me. I have blocked the rest of the group on all social media. My sister told me that I was an AH for just pulling out and not even waiting to speak with Viv. I feel guilty pulling out of the group and refusing to talk to the rest of the band, but I really needed to get out of that space and clear my head. But I am unsure if I should have just pulled out unannounced. AITA?",0.0,0.09103789180517197,0,1
50,1cluj6o,AITA for not sharing the extra money I was paid for a job with my friend who got me the job? ," I (29F) have lived abroad from 2020- jul 2023, during this time I got a little distant from some of my friends who were living in my home country, including my friend A. 

Last year, when I got back I reached out to most my friends, A (32F)  included, to catch up. The first time we met, apart from talking about the things that have happened in our lives, A invited me to do a job for a company she's been working for. Basically they record some courses, which later can be accessed by the people who pay for the platform. I got super excited. 

At first, we had agreed on 3 separate courses, she helped me calculate a fair price to charge, since it's something I've never done before and told me how all the material should be done. 

We talked about recording after some big event that was going to happen in her company and she was responsible for.

The day after the big event we met for drinks and she told me she was super pissed at her boss. Despite all the effort she had put into the event , they never acknowledged it. Then, she proceeded to make me a proposal: she'd try to get her boss to increase the price they'd pay for my work, and we'd split the extra money. I say it's okay, since this money was extra and she was the one to get me the job anyway. 

In the end of Jan, we finally recorded the first course. They did pay me more than the price we had originally agreed, and A asks me for the whole amount that was extra. I didn't see a problem, since I wouldn't even have the gig anyway, and had already agreed to the previous amount. 

After I finished this first course, her boss absolutely loved my job and wanted me to record, not only the 3 courses we had originally decided on, but 7-8. I got super happy and immediately started working on the material for the second course. 

When I finished it and started recording, my friend texted me again asking for her share on the second course. This is a close friend of mine, we've been spending a lot of time together and I didn't want to damage my friendship over money. So I just transferred the money again. 

I've already finished the material for the third course, we went out last weekend and A said she was going to talk to her boss to give me a raise on the next course. I got super excited. Today she texted me saying that she talked about the raise with her boss and they're gonna do it, but then she expects half of it to be transferred to her. 

AITA for not wanting to transfer her any extra money? 
I mean I appreciate her vouching for me and all, but it's very frustrating to just give out money when clearly they'll start paying the other people recording courses the same amount (paying more because of my job that was well done) but they don't have to give back any amount since she'll just ask me, because we're friends and she got me the job.
 
Am I overreacting? Should I just give her the money she's asking? Or how can I tell her I don't think this is fair without changing our friendship?

51,1clug1h,WIBTA if I told my friend her problems are her fault?,"I, 25 F, have a best friend since childhood, also 25 F. She’s one of those people where everything is ALWAYS happening to her. She’s definitely the “crisis friend.” I try my best to be empathetic to her situations, but I’m about at my limit. 

I’ll give some examples of things that have happened recently. She has had her license for a bit over a year, and has totaled 3 cars. Not all of those were her fault. She has a 3 year old child (whom I’m godmother), but she never wanted children. In the state she lives in, if you are married you cannot end a pregnancy without a husbands “permission.” I didn’t know she was even married, let alone pregnant until too late for me to offer any assistance. This was during a time we hadn’t spoken in a while. I later found out that her mother tried to help her end the pregnancy, to which she refused. This led to terrible postpartum depression and psychosis. To this day she wishes she did not have her child, but states she loves her. She has been going through a divorce from an awful human being, basically since their child was born. The father of their child doesn’t contribute financially to caring for the child, and he and his mother overstep boundaries. I’ve told my friend to get the court involved to make things right and she won’t. Her MIL even made her homeless while she was pregnant, and her husband stayed living in his mother’s home while my friend had to do unsavory things to get by. Her family is very abusive and manipulative, but she refuses to cut them off. Her own father has scammed her out of thousands of dollars, her mother, sister, brother, and extended family all basically know they can walk all over her and my friend just allows it. 

When my friend goes to make a decision that she knows she shouldn’t, she will ghost me and tell me afterwards. When she was out of a job, she has had men pay for things for her (like a car). and in one visit to my home in a different state, one of those men came to my house unannounced in the middle of the night to take the vehicle back. She continues to speak this that man to this day, one year later, despite now having a full time job. I get that it is hard to make ends meet, but meeting up with strange men is unsafe and irresponsible (she’s even gone out of state with random men), and she now has a child to worry about. 

It’s bad decision after bad decision. She’s the kind of friend who will call to vent about these bad decisions, but won’t check on how you’re doing. She will ask how I’m doing only to gauge if it would be okay to vent. I have tried many a time to give constructive advice, but she will keep making bad decisions. 

What i’ve laid out is just the tip of the iceberg, and I don’t want to air all her dirty laundry. Obviously not EVERYTHING that has happened is her fault.

52,1clufoj,AITA for not sending exam notes to my bully and causing her to fail?,"I (F21) am a college student. There's a girl (F21, let's call her Katy) in a group with me. So, Katy and her friends are my bullies. They make fun of my appearance almost every day (e.g. my clothes or makeup), and they make unpleasant comments about everything I say. It feels like they hate me for no reason. I try to ignore it and not worry about it too much.

For context, I'm a rather good student, and I attend all the lectures. About two weeks ago, we had an important exam. I was one of the few people who had all the lecture notes. A few days before the exam, Katy texted me, asking for my notes (she had never texted me before). I read this message in my notification bar but didn't open it. I decided to ignore her text and not respond to it at all. I just deleted the notification and didn't care much.

We got the exam results last week, and most people, including me, passed. Katy is one of the few who didn't. During lunch break, Katy ran up to me and started yelling at me that it was my fault she failed the exam because ""I can't even send her my stupid notes."" She also called me names. I was stunned and nervous because it caused quite a stir, and everyone was looking at us. I simply told her she could attend all the lectures and write her notes like I did, or ask anyone else to send them to her. She got even more pissed, but finally gave up and left.

I've talked to my friends about this, and they all think I was rather ah for not sending her my notes and ignoring her text. At first, I didn't care, but now I think I could have just sent it to her and I feel kinda guilty, even though Katy is my bully.

53,1cluch2,AITA for taking a kitten home like we were promised?,"My fiancée and I were relaxing last night when we got a call from her mom. She said a kitten was dropped off at the vet and needed a home. She wanted to know if we would take the kitten (it needs bottle fed). It would be a struggle since we live in an apartment, but we can do it and agreed to get the kitten the next day.

So this morning. We wake up to a text from MIL that goes back on her promise to give us the kitten as fiancée’s little sister (14) wanted her. Fiancée got pretty upset because this happens a lot. Her sister is the golden child and my fiancée is often left behind while her sister gets  what she wants. 

We stopped by the in-laws to pick up some stuff my fiancée left behind. This was when we were meant to get kitten. MIL and SIL were outside working out their new horse so we talked to FIL who told us to take the kitten and go. He gave us the formula and said the original promise stood. We left and took kitten home.

While we were on our way home, MIL called. Fiancée hasn’t answered yet, but it might not be pretty. The kitten was promised to us and we can take care of him, but MIL and SIL wanted to keep him. FIL told us to take him and go.

Are we the assholes?

Edit: Fiancée’s sister was given a neonatal kitten once before to bottle feed, but she ignored him for at least eight hours while my fiancée was at work after she had said she would feed him. The original deal between her and my fiancée was to split care 60/40 with sister doing more, but my fiancée did about 95% of the care while working full time. She isn’t trusted with pets this young. When I said it would a struggle to take the kitten, I meant paying the pet deposit. I work from home so I’m able to care for kitten. Fiancée’s sister and parents already have two dogs, two cats, and seven horses. One of the cats is the adult that little sister was supposed to care for. He is extremely aggressive to people and other pets. They could not keep him.

54,1cluafk,AITA for calling my mom a manipulator? ,"For context I’m an 18F. In recent years my relationship with my mom has been toxic. Every month or so she yells at me for small reasons that I feel like aren’t warranted for that kind of reaction. For example, in January she planned a trip to go visit our family in NJ. I decided to go since I had planned to go early summer and stay for a few months, one of the reasons being the arguments between my mom and I. So while she was packing, she asked to borrow a bag of mine. I said yes, but a few hours later while packing I realized my bag and suitcase wouldn’t fit everything. Knowing the bag I lended her would be big enough, I asked if we could make a switch, to which she reacted yelling and calling me a bitch, saying things like “this is why I wanted to get away from you” ect. After that I went to sleep and the next morning, she acted as if everything was fine and last night never happened. 

Over the months this situation just repeated itself. More recently (two nights ago) it happened again. The situation was, my dad did 3 bags of the laundry, after picking me up from work he asked if I could do them and I said that I would later after my shower. When he left to go pick my mom up from work I folded the clothes. I was able to get 1 full bag and half of the second bag down, and I told my mom as soon as they got in the door that I had only folded 1 1/2 bags of laundry. She reacted the same way as the first example, saying I’m useless and am a bitch. She also mentioned that she loves my brother more and is so glad she had him, after hearing her I called her manipulative for trying to make me feel guilty for such little reason. I told her that she always reacts this way out of nowhere and that I don’t care anymore because it just seems like she’s looking for a reason to argue with me. Soon after she picked a fight with my dad, for what reason? I have no clue.  

The next morning as my dad was driving me to work he told me that I was wrong for saying I didn’t care, and that it’s their house and their rules and I have to abide by them. He mentioned how he doesn’t want to be in the middle of us if my mom gets fed up enough to kick me out, and that being that I’m 18 now she has the right to put me out.

To be frank i wanted to cut N off completely since i just didn't like being around her but i settled for this. 
However, N did not take this lightly and started mentioning her past trauma knowing that E has went through worse.
 N started being rude to E saying that she thought E was different from others but clearly she wasnt. E tried reassuring her that she didnt mean to hurt her feelings but N just went offline. Were E and me too harsh?",1.0,1.0399421453475952,1,1
57,1cltlcq,AITA for not texting my sister?,"Let me set the scene, I 19F is scrolling on insta and I see my sister 24F ( who i haven’t seen in 4 years) was getting married/posted her wedding. So although we haven’t talked to each other in 4 years, the last time we seen eachother it was great and we were on great terms. We literally were raised together even though she’s only my sister on my father’s side. She’s lives in a completely different state from me and she has always been inconsistent when it came to texting, and she had a habit of dodging questions. So I DM her on insta and i’m like “ Omg when were you going to tell us you were getting married???!!” ( Me and my other siblings). She responds with a whole bunch of crap about how we never reach out to her and we’ve been avoiding her. And i was confused b/c my other sister has been trying to contact her for almost a year now. The last time any of us heard from her she was in a different state from where she lives, and she said she’ll contact my other sister when she’s back home. It’s been almost a year and it was radio silence from her. And I will admit that I could’ve texted her, but i’m not much of a texting or phone call kind of person. Idk if i have Adhd, but i’m an out of sight out mind kinda person, so in my mind we were good. And I told her that if she felt she was being avoided why didn’t she reach out? The phones goes both ways. And a wedding is a celebration where you invite distant cousins and even coworkers. So how don’t you invite your sisters, and your only excuse is you felt you were being avoided? If I was getting married right now, I can assure she would’ve gotten an invitation! So should I be upset or am I being the asshole?


Update:
So i’ve talked to my sister and she’s trying to just love bomb me and my other sisters by saying it was all just miscommunication and she loves us, but i told her how could it have been miscommunication if we weren’t communicating…? Then she has the audacity to say “just b/c i didn’t invite yall to my wedding doesn’t mean yall shouldn’t invite me…”. So it’s not crazy for someone to EXPECT to be invited to a wedding. Some reply’s have been making me seem entitled, but she’s my sister, we were raised together by my mom and the last time i saw wasn’t that long ago.

58,1cltjnn,AITAH because my friend missed her flight and I had her ID/CC? ,"EDIT: Okay we talked. She is not mad she missed her flight supposedly. She is mad that I told her I would have flown without leaving her ID if it came
down to it. She thinks I *POTENTIALLY* left her stranded as if it would hand taken her multiple days to get back home. Yes she is mad about a hypothetical situation that actually isn’t even true. After fighting like hell with the airline they did take her ID. 
I was told she could fly home just fine. I believed that. So I left. Had someone told me she wouldn’t have been able to get home of course I would have missed my flight!!! She’s my friend I wouldn’t willingly do that to her! Before you come at me I didn’t know there was a special place to drop off lost items. The airline workers could’ve told me that!!! 
I think she’s mad she missed her flight and is seriously grasping at straw to make an argument

Okay so it was a weekend birthday trip for myself. Fast forward to the last day and we are heading home (3 of us on the same flight, 2 other friends left earlier) let’s call my friends K and D. 
My friend K leaves her phone at the Airbnb. She discovered this while in line waiting for breakfast at a hotel. We’re in Las Vegas btw. So she asked for mine or my friends’ phone in order to Uber to and from the Airbnb and possibly meet us at the airport. I gave her my phone. 
She arrived at the Airbnb and called D to let us know she had trouble finding her phone. We said okay, well we will meet you at the airport if you can’t find it. She found it but it took awhile. D texted her (our group chat) and said okay we are heading to the airport. Before she left the breakfast, we told her to be at the airport at 12:30. We all had the same flight. 
D and I arrive at the airport and I realized I have K’s ID and CC. Why do I have it you ask? Because she asked me to hold it on Friday when we went to a pool party. She never took it back from me and I forgot I had it. 
I tried to give her ID to the airline and they refused. I said so if I leave with her ID is she stuck in Vegas forever? They said no, she just has to do extra screening. 
She was late. The flight BOARDED at 12:30. Yes you’re supposed to be 2 hours early for a flight. D and I know that, we were pushing it. 
12:45-1:00 K calls and she is downstairs but we have scanned our tickets to board. I asked them to bring my friends ID to TSA since I was afraid of missing my flight. They said no, and if I leave the plane is taking off in 9 minutes with or without you. I chose to not risk it and boarded. K did not make the flight. The lady at the gate said she would take K’s ID and hold it. 
K is blaming me for the “miscommunication” about the time for boarding and for *potentially* taking off with her ID and leaving her stranded. She said I don’t “travel like family” and she “can’t trust to travel with me”
I didn’t leave her stranded. I was told she could fly home just fine. It’s not the first time someone has lost their ID in Vegas…. Not
To note: while at the Airbnb she said she found her phone and thought she had extra time so she was “just chillin” and made 2 15 minute calls on my phone to a mutual friend. One call was at 11:55 and D had texted her at 11:56 that we were on our way to the airport…
So yeah, please let me know what you think or if you need more info

59,1cltejw,AITA for texting my roommate when she brought home a second cat?,"My roommate has a cat that meows desperately when she’s not home, but stops immediately when she returns home. On Friday night, my roommate didn’t come home for the entire night, and her cat meowed as usual. On Saturday around 8:30AM, she suddenly came home with a second cat. I was woken up and confused why the cat didn’t stop meowing, then realized it sounded like a different cat. The meows were very high-pitched and higher frequency, so probably a kitten. After listening to kitten meows for half an hour and couldn’t go back to sleep, I texted my roommate “Is there another cat in the apartment?” And she replied yes and sorry for the racket. And that’s it, no explanation on how long the second cat will be there. 

The kitten meows were really clear so she probably had it close to her room’s door. Side story - Her room is large and can fit two king size beds, with a large walk in closet that can also fit a bed. I wish she could put the kitten on the far end of the room or in the large walk in closet, less noise for me and probably better for the original cat too to have some separation with the new cat. But I decided to not tell her that since it’s her room. She also has a pile of like 10 boxes and trash wrappers from online shopping so maybe the only floor space left is by the door. 

The kitten’s meows were driving me crazy, and I wanted some peace on a Saturday, so I left the apartment and texted my roommate that she can let the cats out of her room because I will be out of the apartment for a few hours. Around 8 hours later, I came home and found my roommate gone, the new cat gone, but the original cat was left behind. The original cat greeted me unusually desperately that makes me think it thought it was abandoned. My roommate didn’t come home that night either. 

AITA for those texts? I didn’t mean to make her leave. I just wanted to confirm I’m not going crazy thinking I heard a second cat. I also thought it’s bad for the resident cat, even if my roommate was just babysitting a friend’s cat, so I thought speaking up would be something I could at least do for the original cat, so it can hang out in a different room.

60,1cltaj8,AITA for refusing to go to my cousins wedding because she badmouthed me?,"I (21F) have a cousin (21F) whom I’ve been with my entire life. Lets call her Lisa. We have basically been inseparable since birth and from then on we have continuously shared the same friend group and been in the same class in school up until University.

Here comes the issue. Lisa has been dating this guy from her class in University since about a year and a half back. I don’t know him quite well since we have only met twice. Lisa is hed over heels for this man and has decided that she wants to get married with him. They have now signed a contract for an appartment together they will move into in June. 

I have not had any fights or huge disagreements with Lisa ever since we have been kids. Even though we are the same age I’ve always felt like her older sister since she would often get herself into trouble as a kid and afterwards run away so I got the blame. Well, apparently Lisa has not felt the same as I have towards her. She has been sneakily talking to my other cousin and my uncle and basically badmouthing me every chance she got. Lisas very affectionate and would always tell me she loves me and that I’m her number one person, so this came as quite a shock. She has basically been telling events that has happened between us and misconstrued it. For example, when she came to my appartment to sleep over she said that it was very unkept and unclean (she also told my grandmother this). This is very bizzare to me considering the fact that I had especially cleaned the appartment right before she came and she commented on how neat it was. She also said some other stuff about how it had a bad aura etc. She has been saying worse stuff regarding me, like how I am a catfish and that no one should tell me about their private lifes since I share it directly with my mother (I have no contact with my mother). Other more serious topics of conversation has also been misconstrued by her which I won’t get to deeply in here. 

Lisa has recently gotten engaged and I went to her engagament knowing all of this and helped out quite a lot with serving people etc because I didn’t want to confront her or cause up a huge stirr before one of the most important moments of her life. She will get married legally in the town hall in June, where all our friends and family will be there, but I have work scheduled on that day. Keep in mind this is not an actual ”wedding”, but an event where both parties sign a legal document to get married. I told her I won’t be able to make it because of work and she told me to just call in sick. I’m wondering if its even worth it at this point. I feel really distraught about all of this. If I confront her about this it will also get really awkward in our friend group and shared group chat. I also know that she will make up excuses or otherwise get really defensive and throw it in my face. It’s exchausting just thinking about it. I don’t even want to go to her wedding at all anymore.

63,1clszs2,WIBTA If I Refused to Stay at GF’s Place Because Its Below My Standards?,"I(37M) have been dating my GF(29F) for a few weeks and things between us have been going great.  We have some shared sensibilities but are very different in so many other aspects of our lives that it’s been exciting and invigorating to share new experiences with each other.  One big difference that I’m having trouble getting over is the conditions in which she lives.  

She maintains a very minimalist lifestyle and is essentially renting out a tiny 1-room studio cabin in someone’s backyard. There is a small <100 sq ft. living area that connects to a tiny corner kitchen and then a shower/toilet combo area that is partitioned only by a shower curtain. There is always random belonging that have to be shuffled around because there’s not enough storage and there is essentially no privacy using the toilet.

She is totally content living in that space and sees no problem with it.  I, on the other hand feel very uncomfortable with how cramped it is and especially with how little privacy there is in the room.  I made up an excuse to leave her place a few days ago because I had to do a number 2 and I could *not* bear the idea of doing that in that small room and having her hear and smell *everything*. 

I’m not a wealthy person, but I have a comfortable 2bd2ba apartment with comparatively lots of extra space, a full kitchen, and *doors* for each bathroom.  She lives very close to her job, so it’s much less convenient for her to stay at my place, but it seems so rude and arrogant to tell her that I am uncomfortable with how she lives and that we should only go to my place.

She maintains a very minimalist lifestyle and is essentially renting out a tiny 1-room studio cabin in someone’s backyard. There is a small <100 sq ft. living area that connects to a tiny corner kitchen and then a shower/toilet combo area that is partitioned only by a shower curtain. There is always random belonging that have to be shuffled around because there’s not enough storage and there is essentially no privacy using the toilet.

She is totally content living in that space and sees no problem with it.  I, on the other hand feel very uncomfortable with how cramped it is and especially with how little privacy there is in the room.  I made up an excuse to leave her place a few days ago because I had to do a number 2 and I could *not* bear the idea of doing that in that small room and having her hear and smell *everything*. 

I’m not a wealthy person, but I have a comfortable 2bd2ba apartment with comparatively lots of extra space, a full kitchen, and *doors* for each bathroom.  She lives very close to her job, so it’s much less convenient for her to stay at my place, but it seems so rude and arrogant to tell her that I am uncomfortable with how she lives and that we should only go to my place.

64,1clsrar,AITA for giving my 3-year-old niece a spicy green bean?,"This is a real low-stakes situation here, I'm just left feeling kind of bad about it and want some outside perspective.

Background: I (25F) am currently living with my sister (31F) her husband, and her daughter (3F). 

I was in the dining room eating some leftover Thai food, when my niece comes up to me and asks if she can try some of my food. I say, ""Are you sure? It's really spicy."" She replies that she likes spicy. That isn't something I've ever heard her say, but I've never known her to be a picky eater, so I tell myself it's probably fine. I hand her a green bean and she eats it, says she likes it, then leaves. 

A few minutes later my sister and niece come back into the room, my niece's face is red and I can see tears in her eyes. My sister very sternly asks me ""Did you give her some of your curry? You should have known it's way too spicy for a 3-year-old, that was really irresponsible. What were you thinking?"" Apparently after my niece walked away she started to struggle with the heat, and unfortunately ended up touching her eyes (I guess I should have warned her not to do that). 

My sister and I are fine, I apologized to her and my niece, but I feel bad about the whole situation still. I obviously feel bad that my niece ended up being overwhelmed by the spice and ended up with stinging eyes, but I can't help but feel like I was treated a little unfairly? 

I was eating a ""2 out of 5 chili peppers"" green curry, and it's not like a gave her a spicy bean because I thought it would be funny to see a 3 year old sweat. My sister and brother in law have never had an issue with me sharing food with her before, and she's usually pretty adventurous with her food, so I'm pretty sure the food sharing wasn't the issue.  

Being called irresponsible just got to me more than it should, because I don't feel like I was actually acting that irresponsibly. I'm not really sure what to think, was I actually out of line or did my sister overreact?

EDIT: I talked to my sister again and it's all better. We kind of got to the core of the issue, which is that I'm an adult who doesn't have her own place, so I was overly-sensitive about being called irresponsible. She assured me that isn't what she meant, and she clarified she was bothered that I didn't bother to warn her about touching her eyes, not so much about the food itself being spicy.

My (30m) wife is expecting and  now we think about  who to make godmother of our child.

I always had a good relationship to my sister (28f) but in the last 10 years our paths drifted more and more apart. I still like her as a person but question a lot of her life decisions. I am an ambitious person who is doing my PhD in Natural Science, my wife is working in the finance industry. We both think it is important to put effort in making enough money so you can live carefree and not be endangered by poverty once you grow old. 
My sister on the other hand has a very low paid job in healthcare with no possibility to ever climb any higher on the ladder in the future. basically you reach a dead end with 30. She would have the wits to do a similar job with higher pay, but she doesn't want, she likes her job (which I am honestly very happy for her), but she is coming by only hard, she would have directly financial problems once the whole economic situation would get worse and she is always pointing out how little she earns, making everyone feel bad who earns an average or slightly above average wage. But of course, money doesn't matter as long as you are happy. 
As you can see, her value system is very different to mine, and even though I love her as a sister, I am thinking if I really want her to be the godmother of my child. I just fear on the other hand, that she wouldnt take it very well if I would not make her godmother, but instead a very good friend of mine.

67,1cls1j4,AITA for making someone pay me money they’ve owed me when they’re broke?,"Back story, about two years ago I consigned a Tiffany gold wedding ring from a previous relationship with a jeweler to sell. They’re selling online for between $1000 and $2000 for the same ring used like mine. My arrangement with him was a handshake deal.

He really liked the ring and wanted it for himself so about a year ago I told him I’d sell it to him for $500.  This ring was from a really bad relationship, so I just wanted it out of my life.  Prior to that it had been sitting in a drawer for 20 years.

Fast forward to present time and he still hadn’t paid me.  I live a pretty comfortable life and have a good steady nice paying job, so I don’t need the $500.  If he had asked, I probably would have given it to him with a suggestion that he have the evil exes demons cast out.

He didn’t ask and I was tired of feeling taken advantage of.  So yesterday I went nuclear on him.  I texted him and told him I either wanted the ring back or the $500.  I told him if he didn’t get me one or the other in the three days time that I would be filing felony theft charges against him (the value makes it a felony in my state).

He texted me back this morning and said he’d have the money for me today.  I picked it up from him and his withdrawal slip was still in the envelope.  It left him with $30 in his checking account.  I’m feeling bad about it, but I’m not the one who did wrong.  I feel like I made him a very generous deal when I told him I’d sell it to him.

My landlord ownes one unit while the second unit is owned by a family I'm going to call the Smith family. Right next to the house I live in is another house where the rest of the Smith family lives. 

A couple weeks ago I found rocks and a note placed on my balcony. The note said that my dog is crying and whining at night and that if I don't shut my dog up they're going to call the police and services to take away my dog.

My dog is never alone and definitely not at night. I work from home and never leave the house unless I'm taking him out for walks, except on Fridays when my husband and I go out for 2 hours max. Worried my dog has separation anxiety I set up cameras to monitor my dog and discovered that when left alone he whines for cca 5 seconds in total before he goes to sleep. I told my vet and she informed me this is nothing to worry about.

I went to speak to the neibghour next door, the one that wrote the note, and and she advised me to leave my dog alone more often. She said how she can't hear the dog herself and that only her son hears him and how we are the best tenants yet. The Smith family that lives upstairs said they hear the whining too and that they agree with the neibghour next door.

It was weird to me they're bothered by 5 seconds of whining once a week but I decided to let it go, even tho the whining can't even be heard from another room in our own apartment.

A week later I woke up with another note from the same neighbor, telling me how our dog has been whining every night and how this is her last warning before she calls the police. I have camera evidence my dog doesn't whine at all so I decided to try to speak to her again but she refused to talk to me. I walked around the neighborhood to see if there is any other whining dog she might be hearing every night, but the whole neighborhood was silent. 

I called my landlord. He told me that if the Smith family calls the police he won't be renewing our contract for the next year since he doesn't want trouble with any neighbors, even if I have the evidence he doesn't whine.

I decided to ignore it all and there has been many more notes. I quit leaving the house all together, my dog is NEVER alone and doesn't whine yet the threats of calling the police continue. I have proof my dog doesn't whine and I can't be civil with this family anymore, it's just not an option since they refuse to talk to me face to face.

Others told me the Smith family does this to every tenant our landlord has and that it's because the Smith family has property dispute with my landlord over the apartment I live in.

My birthday was just about a month ago and one of the things promised to me was I was going to get a belly button piercing and have it done BEFORE my birthday so I’d have it on the day I turned 17. I’ve been asking for a piercing for YEARS and finally my mom (57f) and my dad (59m) were able to compromise with me on the belly button piercing since they hate anything on the face. Well days before my birthday my disorder did the things disorders do and I was sent to the hospital for a few days. I basically spent most of my actual birthday alone. I finally get out, have friendship issues immediately and become a wreck. My mom takes me for the piercing and lo and behold my body isn’t atomically able to have one. I’m distraught and trying to convince them to get something else done. Here’s where I’m unsure of what to do, I’ve been attempting to find a new piercing that would make them happy but every conversation is turned down immediately. They think anything on the face is too much, tongue being “slutty” and nose being “a bull ring”. I think it’s so important to me because as stated, disorders have kinda controlled soo much of my life and my body, and in a way this shows I have control over myself and my body. I tried to explain this but I didn’t feel heard. I get the “I’m sorry I wasn’t cooler, it’s just a piercing, you can do whatever you want when you’re 18”. I understand but also, saying you hate all these piercings just makes me afraid to do them in the future because what if you think I’m all those things you’ve said? I’ve tried to get this control though other means (some healthy and admittedly others not so much) like coloring my hair or doing a new wardrobe shop but it’s just not the same since I got so hopefully for the other piercing.

70,1clr9qw,AITA for not taking all our kids on vacation once a year?,"  
Hubby and I plan an annual anniversary trip for JUST the 2 of us and we don't take any of our 9 kids. Are we AHs for not taking (and paying for) all our kids to accompany us on vacation?  
  
Hubby (49M) and I (50F) take an anniversary vacation every year to an adult-only resort. We have 9 kids between the two of us ranging from 12 to 28.  
  
Hubby and I started dating in 2015. We both have kids from previous marriages- a LOT of 'em (Him, 23F, 20F. 19M, 17.5M. Me, 28F, 26F, 23F, 15M, 12F). When this controversy started, his kids resided with his ex about 2 miles from our house. Hubby has always been very involved with his kids, a very hands-on parent. They come over multiple times a week.  
  
It takes a whole year of planning and saving, but we take one no-kids vacation per year. My kids understand and haven't made a big deal. His kids, going back to when they were in the middle school/junior high, have expressed displeasure. ""Why are you taking Dad on vacation but not us"". ""If Dad gets to go somewhere we're supposed to go too."" I laughed it off at first, writing it off as typical preteen entitlement, and explaining that the reason WHY it's ""vacation"" is because there's no kids constantly asking for this-n-that, complaining, picking over the food only to cry about being hungry an hour later, etc. We do take them to other things locally on a regular basis.  
  
When we got married in 2018, his kids tried to invite themselves to our honeymoon and were again upset that they didn't come with us :/  
  
Now they're in high school/college/young professional - one's an RN making $45 an hour. The 2nd oldest just took a job making $30/hour working 50 hrs a week. The 3rd oldest gets a full SSI benefit check and the youngest works 30 hours a week at a hospital - none of them have rent or utility bills.  
  
The topic came up again in January ""why aren't you taking US too?"", referring to this year's anniversary trip to Jamaica in June. I said okay- if y'all want to join this time, great. LMK and I'll send you the link to start making payments on your reservation and airfare.  
  
That was a big blow-up. They are offended that I won't 100% pay their way to take a vacation. 3 of them are... shall we say... of SIZE (300+ pounds) and I don't even want to try to calculate how much it would take to feed all of them every single day. Plus they are all somewhat negative- there's always a dark cloud following them. They rarely smile, they complain a lot (we found that out when taking them places over the years). We don't want the drama and maintenance when we take some time away. Hubby agrees- but he's taking the brunt of all 4 of them basically demanding that they be handed a free vacation.

They are offended that I won't 100% pay their way to take a vacation. 3 of them are... shall we say... of SIZE (300+ pounds) and I don't even want to try to calculate how much it would take to feed all of them every single day. Plus they are all somewhat negative- there's always a dark cloud following them. They rarely smile, they complain a lot (we found that out when taking them places over the years). We don't want the drama and maintenance when we take some time away. Hubby agrees- but he's taking the brunt of all 4 of them basically demanding that they be handed a free vacation.  
  
I realize this problem is very first-world, so I might be the AH for that reason too. I love them all, but are hubby and I the AHs for wanting a kid-free week?",0.0,0.9657337665557861,1,0
71,1clr26j,AITA for feeling uneasy about my fiancés parents coming to our honeymoon?,"My fiancé (21F) and I (23M) have been together for 6 and a half years, engaged for 2.

I think one thing that I haven’t made clear properly and that’s my fault is. She’s very understanding and has told me that her parents are just attending as their own vacation.

72,1clqe18,AITA because I don’t wanna pay extra bills because my step daughter is living with us?,"I got married 3 years ago my husband and we both have children of our own from past relationships. I’ve got a son who is graduating university and he has a daughter who graduated 2 years ago. My SD used to live on her own and had jobs but because her landlord started having unreasonable demands she asked if she could move with us and we said she can. She still has her job.

Just recently my husband brought up the bills of the month and obviously they were higher than usual because now it is the consumption of 3 instead of 2. I thought that since we are 3 adults living then the distribution is going to be among us 3 but no my husband wanted to distribute everything among him and I. So the consumption of 3 among only 2. 

Now why is that a problem to me:-

1-I felt it is unfair that Im paying extra money for an adult with a job to live rent free.

2-As I said my son is graduating, and I’ve been saving up for his graduation gift. So Im already low with my own personal budget because I save huge portion of my income to get that gift. 

When I told my husband why can’t she contribute atleast a little bit his reasoning was “she’s here to save up”. Okay and I wanna save up too?? But he told me that a young adult getting help is more important than a graduation gift and I should “sort my priorities”. I got so annoyed at him and told him that I’ve been saving up for so long for this gift Im not gonna ruin everything now and even if I wasn’t saving up for this gift I wouldn’t have contributed more money just for an adult to live rent free,I’d use that money on myself.

I (M21) and romantic partner (F20) recently received a call from my older brother (M) about if my Fiance would baby sit his son (M3), M-F from around 9-5 for $100.00 per week.  I work full time, and she is a homemaker, and I make enough for us both to live without issue. We have no kids, and have absolutely no plans for them in the future. 
At the time that he asked, my S/O and I had been discussing things she may want to do to fill her time during the days, such as a hobby of some kind.

Me and him have been together for almost a year. And we’ve celebrated his birthday in the start. I got him some pretty great gifts for his birthday. And then valentines day aswell. Now, after 11 months of being together, my birthday came. 

Firstly, he was late to wish me. And had kindof forgotten in the spur of the moment as he was ‘busy’ running an erand. Then he got into a heated argument with his overlyy involved family and made that as an excuse for not doing anything special for my birthday. He said hes planning on celebrating with me. But its been a month now and i dont really see him even giving it a second thought. Mind you, i made his birthday a really huge thing. And ON his birthday at that. 

Today, we were having a conversation and my roommate’s late birthday present, for me, arrived and i showed it to him. I casually brought up the fact that he hasnt gotten me anything for my birthday, being my boyfriend. and hasnt done anything. he told me that he didnt plan on buying me ANYTHING. And i got really hurt by that. He got pissed that i expected anything and started making a scene about how im so insensitive and didnt even bother asking him how things were with him and his family and how i know that he cant spend money on me. All while searching for a 5th tennis racket for himself (which are very expensive). I didnt ask because he always tells me when something is wrong and i dont like to poke the bear much and bring back bad memories. 

I reminded him how ive always gotten him presents without any special occasion and its not wrong for me to expect a birthday gift. He then tells me not to get him anything for his birthday either and if i do hell simply return them back to me. And left.

76,1clppeo,AITA for telling my sister that idc about the baby she lost,"I (20m) and my sister (23) have been very close since she lost her baby. She lost the baby at the end of 2022, when she was about 5 months pregnant. Obviously our whole family was shocked and very supportive initially. However I really tried to help her through this and get her back on her feet. Coming to her apartment to clean, and cook her food. It also doesn’t help that her baby daddy left shortly after. My sister was unable to work because of her depression, so my family would help chip in and pay her bills. She remained like this for about 7 months when my parents told her that they couldn’t no longer support her, when all she does is lay in bed (and smoke a lot, like 24/7, but they don’t know that), and that she at least needs to look for a job. She lashed out and said she needs their support now more than ever. Regardless of them, I began to solely supporting her. Mind you I still live with my parents and attending school. 

That brings us to last Friday, I have about 3 semesters left of school and money has been getting tight. I told my sister that I really need to start saving, and that she needs to get a job, or just move back in. She lashed out on me, saying that I could never understand (100% true) and that I was a terrible brother for even mentioning it. I said excuse me? I’ve paying for your bills for over a year, and have been the only one trying to help her get over this. She began yelling at me and calling me terrible names. I just snapped and said idgaf about her dead baby. I did none of this for that baby. I helped her because I love my sister, I want what’s best for my sister, I want her to recover. I told her this and just she started attacking me. I just left. 

The next morning my parents sat me down, and told me what I said was very wrong and rude. I explained what happened and how I still continued paying her bills after they stopped. They just were quiet, and then just left. My mother grabbed my shoulder and told me that my sister started apply for jobs.

He has ignored me for three weeks and finally reached out. ,"So I’m a college student and I had a little fight with my roommate who has been my best friend since seventh grade. I also have another friend who I met last year through my girlfriend who is one of my closest friends, so when me and my roommate got into this argument they both went outside to talk during a party we threw on April 20th. I walked out on them talking and didn’t really notice anything odd so I just went back inside to the rest of our friends. The next day however, my roommate blew up on me and I was taken by shock because I really didn’t think there were any issues. So once we went back to class on Monday, I asked the friend she was talking with (who I had been friends with a whole semester prior to them meeting) about what was said & what the issue was because she hadn’t said anything to me. He refused to tell me and said that if I wanted to know I would need to talk to my roommate. In the moment I felt like he was picking sides and was really hurt so I snapped at him and just sort of ignored him for the rest of class. 

Later that night, me and my roommate talked and realized that the whole argument was a misunderstanding and made up with no hard feelings.

After that, I felt bad that I snapped at him so I messaged him this: “hey i was going to wait until tomorrow but i just wanna apologize for taking my frustration out on you monday. it was super uncalled for and i really am sorry that i put you in that position. but i want you to know that i love you and i am not mad at you at all i was just hella upset about the whole situation but it was so wrong of me to take that out on you when you did nothing wrong.” 

He didn’t respond that night so I was assuming he was busy as finals were coming up. But, this ignoring me as well as all of our mutal friends has lasted until today (May 6th) when he finally reached out wanting to talk. 

Me and this friend have had several fights in the past as we both have very strong emotions but this one felt so not important that I am really confused on why it blew up like this. I am worried that I am in the wrong, I know that it was wrong of me to snap at him but I did apologize before he ignored me for three weeks.

Me and my friend got into an argument. He has ignored me for three weeks and finally reached out.  So I’m a college student and I had a little fight with my roommate who has been my best friend since seventh grade. I also have another friend who I met last year through my girlfriend who is one of my closest friends, so when me and my roommate got into this argument they both went outside to talk during a party we threw on April 20th. I walked out on them talking and didn’t really notice anything odd so I just went back inside to the rest of our friends. The next day however, my roommate blew up on me and I was taken by shock because I really didn’t think there were any issues. So once we went back to class on Monday, I asked the friend she was talking with (who I had been friends with a whole semester prior to them meeting) about what was said & what the issue was because she hadn’t said anything to me. He refused to tell me and said that if I wanted to know I would need to talk to my roommate.

81,1clovj1,AITA for not going to my friends wedding?,"(all names changed for privacy reasons) I (28f) have been friends with Anne (29f) since uni. She met Dexter (30m) about five years ago through a dating app and they are getting married this november.

Now i have no real problem with Dexter but we have never really got along, he's conservative and i am quite strong on my political beliefs (relativley center, maybe a bit towards socialist). I try to avoid him where i can.

The date they have chose for the wedding is my late sister's birthday. This day is important to me as i spend it with my brother and half-sister and we just enjoy the day doing things my sister loved.

I brought this up to Anne a couple months ago and told her in no uncertain terms that with the date the wedding was I wasn't going to attend. I shared the reason and she replied that she wouldn't change it because that's also the date that her and dexter first met. I told her that was fine and that i didn't expect her to do that but that i wouldn't be in attendance.

She then started nagging me and said that i celebrate this evey year but her wedding is just one day and that i could just celebrate after. I told her i wouldn't do this as it means a lot to me and my siblings. After this she started screaming at me and asking if i actually hated her.

Since then her and a couple other friends from college have been blowing up my phone telling me that it doesn't matter and i should just go to her wedding. She even said ""your sister is already dead, what does it matter?""

Part of me is glad i didn't agree but the other part of me is worried that i really hurt Anne's feelings and i should have just sucked it up and gone.

Edit:

(fixed a bit of grammar)

also I've texted my siblings, going to have a discussion and see what they think.

Another edit for clarification, me and Anne are friends but not especially close, she started off as a friend of a friend and it's not changed too much. I think if you add up all the times we've had a conversation one on one  i don't know if you could piece together a whole hour.

82,1cloq91,AITA for not getting a driver’s license?,"I am a 30-something woman who can’t drive. I’ve never had a license.

I currently live and work in a place where it’s much easier and more affordable to commute using public transportation. I’m fine with this. I also use a bicycle to get around (big biking culture where I live).

My partner of 10+ years is not ok with this at all. He really wants me to get a license. The problem is that it costs a lot of money to get a license here. The average cost for all the lessons and exams is over €3000. As you can imagine, I don’t have that lying around. The only way to learn is with a qualified instructor. There are no parking lots or quiet roads for practice.

Last year I managed to save enough for the lessons. I took about 15 lessons, but I feel that I made very little progress in that time. This was due to a few reasons. My instructor was changed halfway through, neither of the instructors were very good (constantly on their phones and not giving constructive feedback). I was also off work due to depression during this time. Probably a bad decision to start the lessons then, but I felt A LOT of pressure from my partner to do “something”. I know that I should’ve spoken up when I felt the instructor wasn’t helping, but I was nervous about confronting them. Needless to say, I did not learn to drive and I did not get a license.

Now all this time of me not driving has had an effect on my relationship with my partner. He has a lot of resentment towards me because he is the only driver in our home (just the two of us). Because of the driving thing, he says that he feels like a caregiver instead of a partner. This has affected his attraction towards me. We have not been intimate in six months (and in the last couple of years like 10 times in total). This has taken a huge toll on me and my feelings towards my partner.

I want to drive because I think it’s a good skill to have (even though I won’t get a car anytime soon). I just feel like €3000 is a lot for this. I also have a recurring nightmare of losing control of a vehicle. Could this be affecting me subconsciously? I was not particularly anxious during the lessons.

I’ve passed the theory exam like six times, but every time it expires because I haven’t done the practical exam.

AITA for not spending half of my savings on a license and therefore creating resentment in my partner?

I was learning to drive manual, I didn’t grow up on a farm and my parents weren‘t able to teach me.

Yes I’ve taken the theory test several times. It wasn’t 6, but actually 4. And the last one is gonna expire this month.

She's still in the hospital and won't be home for another few weeks yet. I (16m) am home with my stepdad and my half brother and sister since my dad isn't in the picture. But my half siblings go to our grandparents during the day and my stepdad picks them up after work. Sometimes he will keep them with our grandparents for a few extra hours if he's visiting mom and stuff.

My stepdad also has two kids from his other marriage. His daughter is 11 and his son is 10.

My stepdad's kids treat my mom like shit. They're being trained to act like that by their mom and my stepdad and her have been in court so many times in the last 5 years. But nothing has changed with their behavior toward mom and him and his ex still fight often about it. His kids call my mom names, say she feeds them shit, tell her she's fat and ugly and they gag whenever they know she cooked for everyone. It's gross. They told my mom their mom was better than her in every way and she'll never be good. My stepdad punishes them and all that but it's crazy how hateful they are to mom. They're also really rude to mom's family. I don't really have any affection or patience for them so we don't interact. But mom gets it a lot. When my mom was brought to hospital they said good, we hope she dies. My stepdad looked incredibly pissed at them and I acknowledge he intervened immediately.

But all of this means I want nothing to do with them and I'm so glad when they're not at our house. I really dislike them.

My stepdad wants me to feed his kids anyway. He gets home late and he doesn't want to pay for them to stay with a sitter for an hour or two. He also doesn't want to send them to their mom, which I get. So he wants me to provide some food for them and I said no. He told me his kids need to eat and I said it's not my problem and he does not want me left in charge of his kids ever. He told me they'll go hungry without someone to prepare something and I said so what. He told me my attitude could use some work. He said he needs my help and he's sorry they said what they said but I need to understand their mom has poisoned them so much. He told me it won't be forever and I make myself food already so can't I make some extra.

My sister and I lost our mother when we were teenagers. We both went into therapy until it wasn’t financially doable anymore. I had my own issues but my sister was something else. In short she was a nightmare to our dad.

It got even worse when dad started to date again. His breaking point was when he wanted to get married to his gf but she  caused hell. Destroyed the wedding dress and made a lot of threats. My sister was 20 at this time, and his gf couldn’t do it. She didn’t want to marry into a family with my sister in it. I think this was my dads last straw.

Huge argument and he cut her off, and kicked her out. After that the whole household improved, the negative impact her behavior had really became clear. Dad improved greatly and I don’t believe he regrets it

My sister would reach out and I gave her a chance. My dad doesn’t wish to and says his life is better this way, as cold as that sounds.

So I am in contact with my sister and she has calmed down a lot. She is 27 and is getting married. She wants dad to be at the wedding but he won’t respond to anything she sends him. She asked me to contact him.

I told her no and it started an argument ment. By the end I told her the truth that dad is better off without her and I will not help her. She called me a jerk and I am wondering if I am wrong

87,1clnnrj,AITA for leaving my best friend's wedding early?,"I (25F) left my best friend's (22F) wedding early and now she isn't talking to me.

My best friend had a destination wedding. I was a bridesmaid along with 2 friends. Both of them bailed due to the cost of travelling.

Day of the wedding, we got to the venue hours before the wedding was set to begin to offer help and support. When we arrived, my friend was getting in makeup and everything was set up. She told me to get changed while she finished.

I have a pretty intense disability. I have severe chronic pains and struggle standing/walking for more than a few minutes at a time, especially without good shoes. If I know I'll be walking a lot, I use a walker to help with pain. I didn't bring it to the wedding to make room in my car for our bags.

Before changing, I asked when to put on my heels. I knew I would only last a few minutes in them before pain started. I informed her I didn't bring my walker and was worried about being in my heels for too long and asked if there was somewhere I could sit after changing to be off my feet. She told me to change into them and sit down with my BF outside and she'd let me know when I was needed.

For the ceremony, I was the last one of the wedding party to walk down the aisle, so they sent me as the first to exit. It was an outdoor wedding, so while the walk from the ceremony area back to the building wasn't terribly long, being in heels and dress I was tripping over was taking a toll on me by then (about 3 hrs in the heels). I was struggling so bad that all of the groom's party ended up passing me, and the last one to pass by saw how much I was struggling and laughed at me, which stung.

We stayed for photos (which was more walking from the building, back to the ceremony area) and took another 30 min of standing. By that point, I was holding onto my BF for support. Once the photographer told me my part in the pictures was over, my BF helped me back to where we'd been sitting and I broke down crying. We were out of the way to not cause a scene, and the bride and groom were still having photos taken behind the venue.

While I was crying, we saw a couple get in their car and leave, so my BF suggested we leave too. My dress was muddy from dragging through the dirt, everyone else at the event was family so no one was paying us any mind, and inside the building the bride and groom had a table set up for the 2 of them, so there wouldn't be empty seats next to them. Given my pains and the state of my dress and makeup, we knew we wouldn't be dancing or making conversation, and we had a long drive home ahead of us the next day so we left.

It's been a few days and she hasn't responded to any of my messages. Both my and my BF's moms agree it was best we left considering my pain, but others are more split on whether we were in the wrong for leaving.

So, AITA for leaving my best friend's wedding early due to the intense pain I was in?",Asshole,2024-05-06,"AITA for leaving my best friend's wedding early? I (25F) left my best friend's (22F) wedding early and now she isn't talking to me.

My best friend had a destination wedding. I was a bridesmaid along with 2 friends. Both of them bailed due to the cost of travelling.

Day of the wedding, we got to the venue hours before the wedding was set to begin to offer help and support. When we arrived, my friend was getting in makeup and everything was set up. She told me to get changed while she finished.

I have a pretty intense disability. I have severe chronic pains and struggle standing/walking for more than a few minutes at a time, especially without good shoes. If I know I'll be walking a lot, I use a walker to help with pain. I didn't bring it to the wedding to make room in my car for our bags.

Before changing, I asked when to put on my heels. I knew I would only last a few minutes in them before pain started. I informed her I didn't bring my walker and was worried about being in my heels for too long and asked if there was somewhere I could sit after changing to be off my feet. She told me to change into them and sit down with my BF outside and she'd let me know when I was needed.

For the ceremony, I was the last one of the wedding party to walk down the aisle, so they sent me as the first to exit. It was an outdoor wedding, so while the walk from the ceremony area back to the building wasn't terribly long, being in heels and dress I was tripping over was taking a toll on me by then (about 3 hrs in the heels). I was struggling so bad that all of the groom's party ended up passing me, and the last one to pass by saw how much I was struggling and laughed at me, which stung.

We stayed for photos (which was more walking from the building, back to the ceremony area) and took another 30 min of standing. By that point, I was holding onto my BF for support. Once the photographer told me my part in the pictures was over, my BF helped me back to where we'd been sitting and I broke down crying.

89,1clnkfs,AITA for hating the way my partner dresses?,"AITA? Throwaway due to topic sensitivity.
My partner and I (both women) have been together almost 2 years. She initially made an effort to dress well during our first few months together but has progressively dressed worse as the months have gone by.

We have both put on extra weight since first getting together and she says she does not feel good in her skin. I make it a point to tell her how Sexy I find her and love her curves. 
She has been struggling with self worth issues and I feel this is presenting itself outwardly in her dress.

 She no longer wears appropriate clothes to restaurants or on outings and it's bothering me. I make an effort to dress reasonably well as I feel it is important to put your best foot forward into the world. I'm by no means a fashionista but I do conform to societal dress codes according to the occasion. 

It all came to a head when we were due to go out for the day in the city which included a market, the theatre and dinner. She insisted on wearing a graphic sweater covered with anime figures. I tried to suggest something else bit she refused. I became quiet as I was angry and it caused a huge fight. This is not the first time this has happened. She has worn a dress with dirty Wellington boots, or tights with holes in them, or smart trousers with running shoes. It has become embarrassing and hurtful because I always make an effort to look good for her but it feels like she does not do the same. Am I being controlling? Should I not care? Why is this affecting me so much?

I also said no. Well, my older sister had her bf ask my mom, as well as their 7 year old daughter. I was asked again. I explained that it hasn’t been approved by the landlord, we just got a puppy, and we have a small house. (My mom lives with me). Welp my mom got the dog anyway. As time went on, we had constant issues. She had bitten my stepdad, goes after the puppy (used to be very bad, she’s gotten better slowly), went after the cats, ran away, tried to steal food (this happened once but it’s important for later), would hurt herself trying to hide from people, would eat all the cat food, would not listen at all, etc. My mom is terminally ill. She couldn’t handle her hair or take care of the dog on top of everything else. I told my sister all of these things. But I also told her the good things. Like the dogs are on half raw half kibble diet, they get bark boxes, we have been teaching her how to play, she’s got her own bed, she gets special food due to her throat injury, she gets special shampoo and conditioner bc of her hair, she gets treats that are specifically hers due to her sensitive stomach, etc. I had told my sister around march that I did not like the dog.

94,1clmp5r,AITA for helping one daughter more than the other? ,"I have 2 daughters who have made different choices in life that has led to different economic outcomes. I don’t think one is more responsible than the other but their career paths and choice of partners definitely led to my eldest being much more successful. We recently sold our house and gave about $70k to my youngest to help with buying an apartment.

My eldest(38F) is more gifted in math and is an engineer. She owns her own house and her husband is an anesthesia assistant. They both make a comfortable salary and can afford piano lessons for her son and daughter.

My youngest daughter(35F) was never the best student but loves helping people. She got her degree in psychology and then married her bf at the time. No one in the family liked her bf due to us finding him to be lazy. He worked in snow removal in the winter but then took unemployment in the summer. But she liked him and didn’t listen to our concerns so we decided to be supportive. They married and she went through graduate school for social work. They had a daughter during her schooling and then he decided he didn’t want to be a father. She said it was out of the blue and thinks he found his current gf then and wanted out. They divorced a year later and now my youngest daughter and her daughter has been living in rentals. He does pay child support but only about $300 a month due to his low income which doesn’t even come close to covering daycare. She doesn’t make a lot in social work despite having a masters. I moved over there temporarily to be with her and babysit during the divorce. We also partially paid for her rent at that time. 

We sold our home to downsize to an apartment. We really wanted our youngest daughter to be able to afford a permanent place to live and gave her 70k out of the proceeds of the sale for her to buy an apartment. This was when interest rates were still low so she bought a 1 bedroom for her and her daughter and locked in a good rate. My eldest found out about it and was angry because she feels like we always give her sister money. I told her her sister is struggling and she already has a house.

I have 2 daughters who have made different choices in life that has led to different economic outcomes. I don’t think one is more responsible than the other but their career paths and choice of partners definitely led to my eldest being much more successful. We recently sold our house and gave about $70k to my youngest to help with buying an apartment.

My eldest(38F) is more gifted in math and is an engineer. She owns her own house and her husband is an anesthesia assistant. They both make a comfortable salary and can afford piano lessons for her son and daughter.

My youngest daughter(35F) was never the best student but loves helping people. She got her degree in psychology and then married her bf at the time. No one in the family liked her bf due to us finding him to be lazy. He worked in snow removal in the winter but then took unemployment in the summer. But she liked him and didn’t listen to our concerns so we decided to be supportive. They married and she went through graduate school for social work. They had a daughter during her schooling and then he decided he didn’t want to be a father. She said it was out of the blue and thinks he found his current gf then and wanted out. They divorced a year later and now my youngest daughter and her daughter has been living in rentals. He does pay child support but only about $300 a month due to his low income which doesn’t even come close to covering daycare. She doesn’t make a lot in social work despite having a masters. I moved over there temporarily to be with her and babysit during the divorce. We also partially paid for her rent at that time. 

We sold our home to downsize to an apartment. We really wanted our youngest daughter to be able to afford a permanent place to live and gave her 70k out of the proceeds of the sale for her to buy an apartment. This was when interest rates were still low so she bought a 1 bedroom for her and her daughter and locked in a good rate. My eldest found out about it and was angry because she feels like we always give her sister money. I told her her sister is struggling and she already has a house.

For the first 2.5 years I did this.. I went to every event.. every dinner.. every birthday.. every holiday.. everything. Everytime I felt like an outsider and most did not make the effort to include me it was more so I just faded into the background and waited to get the hell out of there. This was extremely stressful and triggering for me as I struggle with rejection and a dysfunctional family as is. For years I asked my partner to help me tell his parents they aren't making me feel welcomed and from the get go they rejected me because I am not Indian. He addressed this a few times and one of the responses from his mom was, ""well we don't tell her not to come"" after he asked why she never communicates or includes me. I gave grace and have tried but nothing has changed until recently 3 years later his mom wants to include me but now I refuse to do things and go places that make me feel like shit so I've stopped going to the dinners and certain birthdays and cut it down to only major holidays when his cousins are around (I like them a lot).

97,1clmhrm,AITA for getting angry at teenagers for disturbing a movie?,"So... my wife and I 32f 39m, wanted a date night, decides to go to a horror movie screening.  It all started great, the theater only had 2 other people in there so we picked the second to last row in the back and got comfortable. 


About 10 minutes before it starts a group of 6 teenagers comes in, 5 guys and 1 girl.  They immediately start acting rowdy, walking all around the theater, stomping and dropping popcorn, I dont really think nothing of it, just kids being kids I guess. They select the seats right behind us... in an empty theater, so admittedly I get a little pissy and vocalized my frustration by saying ""jesus christ"" and we move up 3 rows.


Well the movie starts and they break up into groups, 2 guys and the girl move over to the far right back and the other 3 stay put. During the first 30 minutes one of them would walk back and fourth between the groups.  The group in the back right are steadily talking, whispering and laughing.  This annoys my wife and she, imo, respectfully goes up to them and asks them to stop.  That lasted for 15 minutes and so I (I have a deep voice therefore loud when raised) say ""HEY! Be respectful or leave.""  That last for like 10 minutes then I louder.  I sit up in my seat to turn around to look at them and said ""wtf did I just say? Stfu""

Well that worked and the 3 leave for 10 minutes then come back, this time they behave a lot better so it was fine.  Then the movie ends... the original group stand up and clap and start shouting ""great fucking movie!"" Over and over. The movie was not good but that's not the point... we leave, go to the bathroom and I wait for my wife, she left our keys in the theater so we go back.  The kids walk past us in the lobby and i, begrudgingly stare at them all the while they keep repeating ""great fucking movie!"" My wife said to the group ""yall are disrespectful.""  One of them yells out ""fuck you!""


I turn around and start walking towards them then realize they're kids but not before I got in my last words of ""fuck you ya cunts!""

Last night, I noticed my two garbage cans have gone missing. These garbage cans did not come with the apartment. I purchased them on my own (about $30 each). I never had any issues with my neighbors using them or taking any of my stuff. 

  
Now, I cannot be 100% positive that the neighbors took them, but it's too much of a coincidence that they disappeared while they were moving. I have searched around the property and they are no where, so they didn't blow away.

I, along with 3 friends of mine, went out to meet some friends of one of them, who I and one of the other person had never met before.

Only one of these new people that matter though.

Things went well for about 2 hours, before one dude noticed I had a fidget toy on my bag. (Like one of those fidget cubes, but mine is differently shaped.)

He was staring at it, with a look I'd guess I would retroactively call annoyance, so I asked him if something was up. He shook his head, and said something about how ""How he sees that all the time with annoying kids online."" which I found a weird statement. I just replied I use it when I am overwhelmed or overstimulated, adding on that I got autism, to which he replied ""Oh fuck, you're not one of those weirdos who claims to have every disorder ever, are you?"" He said it loud enough for everyone to notice, and the other conversation that was going on kinda fell still.

I couldn't really get myself to respond with anything other than a ""What?""

I can't remember every word, since I was already panicking inside, have auditory sensory issues, and he talked quite fast, but he seemed to started to rant about people online making content about being autistic and other stuff, about how he thinks everyone is faking nowadays and hurting the real people, that kind of stuff mostly. The other people were mostly silent during this, or at least I didn't notice them. The moment it got too much for me was when he started saying that I was probably also one of them, because I... made eye contact, willingly went to a gathering of people, and I apparently don't ""Look like a \[word close but not quite the R-slur\]"" which was the final drop.

At that point I just got up, left the room and grabbed my car to go home, though when I did so he started yelling. Spend basically the rest of the evening trying to calm down, after what happened hit me and I became ultra stressed out and overwhelmed.

Nothing interesting happens all evening, just your typical party full of mostly late 20s guys talking about how awesome zyn is and smoking carts lol.

Liam doesn't really watch movies much other than l the occasional horror or comedy so I drive him nuts when I talk his ear off about it.  I think he just wanted to offload me to that guy 😅 (I'm bi too so that could be part of it) 

We talk a bit about where we're from, what school we graduated from, etc, just boring intro shit but he's definitely nice and easy to talk to. (cute too) 

(I had smoked A LOT during the evening and when I'm high I don't really have much of a filter) 

Anyways, then I bring up what Liam said about us both being big movie nerds since it's not often I meet someone I can talk to about it as much as I would like.

I ask what he's seen recently and I mention baby reindeer which he hadn't heard of, he tells me he recently saw some intense movie I didn't recognize the title of, so he goes ""it has my favorite actor in it"". 

I get curious and ask who his favorite actor is, personally I don't think I even have one. ( Jeremy allen white maybe) 

I'm waiting for his response and the sec his lips start moving and I hear the first letters: ""Ja..""  I think he might say Jack Nicholson for a millisecond, but then I hear it, the full name: ""Jason Statham"". 

I didn't even process the information, I instinctually let out a loud laugh like it was the funniest thing I had heard in weeks, and I couldn't stop laughing for a bit. Then I notice his face and I realize, oh shit, he's actually serious..

Some other ppl clearly saw me just laughing at him who looked kinda uncomfortable, so I quickly say ""sorry I thought you were joking"" to which he lets out a fake chuckle, says ""nice to meet you"" and walks away. 

Half an hour later Liam comes up to me and asks what I said to Angus telling me that he was really upset and said I'm a massive asshole apparently. 

I told exactly what happened and even Liam had to stop himself from laughing, then said ""okay dude just don't talk to him again I guess"" and that was that. No drama. 

The day after all those guys were texting about that one asshole friend of Liam's, I didn't really care that much at first but two of the other guys Liam has known for years told him not to invite me again to future hangouts which made me feel a bit shitty tbh. 

Should I try to get his info and apologize or let it all be? I really dunno, it feels overblown and silly to me but I don't wanna be known as an asshole either and I did like him before that. 




",Asshole,2024-05-06,"AITA for laughing in my mutual friend's face after he told me who his favorite actor was?  Last Friday I was invited to a party by my friend ""Liam"", and I didn't know anyone else there other than him but I'm not shy so I went along. 

Nothing interesting happens all evening, just your typical party full of mostly late 20s guys talking about how awesome zyn is and smoking carts lol. 

Anyways Liam introduces me to his friend, let's call him Angus. Liam tells me he's really into movies and TV shows like I am and that we prob have a lot in common so I'm like yeah sure cool!

Liam doesn't really watch movies much other than l the occasional horror or comedy so I drive him nuts when I talk his ear off about it.  I think he just wanted to offload me to that guy 😅 (I'm bi too so that could be part of it) 

We talk a bit about where we're from, what school we graduated from, etc, just boring intro shit but he's definitely nice and easy to talk to. (cute too) 

(I had smoked A LOT during the evening and when I'm high I don't really have much of a filter)

My husband 31 daughter and I went to my husband's grandmother's 80th birthday this weekend and it was a large party. Well my daughter is the first grandchild and spoiled by all including SIL 38f ""sally"". When we go visit, my daughter and her aunt has a great relationship like the one that I had with my aunt when I was a kid. I love it. She has always been supportive to me with my in-laws and my own parents at times. Well at the birthday there was tons of food. My daughter was having a blast playing with all the other kids and her aunt. I noticed that sil was feeding my daughter cake and cookies and what not. I told sil that daughter had plenty and no more sugar. Well more than once just in a fun tone to not cause problems. It kind of bothered me that I had to say something but keep getting the response of aww it's fine mom I got her. Well low and behold my daughter was up all night with a belly ache. Luckily there was no throw up but she's still in pull ups at night and we changed her twice before she finally went to sleep and gave her some medicine. She didn't go to sleep until about 2 in the morning. Well the next day I talked to my sil and told her about daughter being up and asked her to please stop when I or her brother (husband) says no more. I explained that it wasn't that big of a deal but to keep it in mind for future events. I mean she's my SIL... we see her at every family event. We'll my SIL did not take it too well and went to the extreme saying that she will be hands off from now since she cant be the aunt like shes wants  so she's not in trouble with us or the family when it comes to my daughter. I tried telling her that's not what I was getting at. There was some back and forth and I ended up just telling her to talk to me when she's in calm. It hurts because she has 2 kids of her own and would talk about how her in-laws would over step. I really thought she would understand where I'm coming from.

108,1clkp5a,AITA for asking my neighbor to leave?,"Throwaway because I've already told a few friends about this story.

Yesterday afternoon, I was taking advantage of the nice day we had and decided to wash my car.

A little backstory, I just got a new car a couple months ago, and I'm rather particular about how to wash it. I have specific towels for washing, and specific towels for drying.

I have a neighbor that lives a few houses down, we'll call him Mike. Mike and I have always gotten along, and I have no issues with him or his family. They're nice people.

Mike saw me outside washing my car yesterday and swung by to chat me up as I was drying it off. As he was chatting with me, he was smoking a cigarette as well. Just so happens, the wind we had yesterday was blowing the ashes from his cigarette right onto the car. At first I didn't say anything, I just brushed the ashes off. When it happened again, I said something to him, and he apologized. I said it wasn't a huge deal, no worries, etc. It 100% was NOT intentional.

He then asks if he can borrow something for a few days, and I say sure, let me go inside and grab it for you.

As I come back outside with the thing for him to borrow, he's in my garage, putting one of my towels back in the box it came from.

I asked him ""What are you doing?"", and he replied that he was using one of my towels to wipe the ashes off the car.

I found this to be incredibly disrespectful that he would dig in my stuff without my permission, and touch my car without my permission as well.

I took a deep breath while I decided what to say, and said ""Will you just leave?"".

He apologized for the ashes and touching my stuff, and I said ""Just leave"".

I didn't raise my voice, didn't swear, etc. Just straight up asked him to leave.

He left, and didn't even take the thing he asked to borrow with him.

109,1clkjcz,AITA for asking my parents for a new laptop?,"Hello everybody, second Reddit post of my life, never thought it would be an AITA post though, lmao.

Ok, so before we get into the story, I just want to clarify, my parents are **not** the assholes in this situation, so even if I am not the asshole, they aren't either.

So this happened basically two days ago, a little bit of backstory, I (17m) compose and produce music as a hobby, while also learning programming as I want to be a computer scientist when I grow up, I've always loved computers, coding, math, physic, etc. The problem is that a couple of years ago, my parents bought me this laptop (which I am grateful for, and use every day). However, the specs are not very good, 256 GB of storage and 8 GB of RAM, not the worst, it gets the job done, but it's also not the best. I have a lot of programs installed in my computer, music making software, coding software, some small video games like Celeste. It is very slow when running said programs, and the CPU reaches 100% when I open FL Studio and Google at the same time, which is frustrating. Sometimes when I program it is very slow, and I end up quitting.

I also want to state that I am a little at fault because my parents had offered a better laptop with better specs, and it was like €50 (I'm European) more expensive, but since I didn't want my parents to spend too much money, I chose the one I currently own.

So, two days ago, my dad bought himself a really nice laptop, 1 TB of storage and 16 GB of RAM, which is very good. He is also a music producer and a bassist, except he does it professionally. Now, he *did* buy himself this new laptop because his old 12-year-old laptop had broken, and he needed a new one for work, which I understand completely. So, yesterday I asked my parents for a laptop too, of course not to buy *now* but maybe this summer, if I get good grades. They asked me what was wrong with the one I owned now, and I basically said what I said in the first paragraph, and they answered back with what I said in the second paragraph (about how I could've chosen the slightly more expensive one) and that now they couldn't buy a new one.

Now here is where I think I'm an asshole, I told them that my dad bought a new one though, and it was more expensive than the one I was asking for (which I was asking for before my dad bought the new one), and they said that my dad needed it because his old one broke and that also, it was for work, so it brought us money, and since what I do didn't bring the family money, that it wasn't going to be a good investment, and they would buy me a better laptop once I go to university (in like a year).

111,1clkbum,AITA for not being nice to my grandma,"*sorry it's a long post* AITA for not being nice to my grandma

I  (21F) was hurt by my maternal grandmother (76F), who stayed with my family and I for about 6 months.

For background, I am a college student going from home to save money. Last year, my grandma came from our home country to the US for the first time in about 15 years. My maternal Grandpa has passed away a few years ago, and it's just my grandma now.

While my grandma was here, she treated me extremely bad. When I ask her something nicely, she would respond extremely rude. If I was saw something dirty to clean in the kitchen, she would be like ""I Just washed it"" but there would be junk and soap still visible. Since I was a kid, I couldn't handle loud noises (I have noise sensitivity). My grandma never understood that I can't handle loud noises, music, when people talk really loud etc. on a day to day basis. My grandma would talk extremly loud, when doing tasks, she would make noise on purpose, etc.

I tried to be nice to her since she was my grandma, but she would just walk all over me. For the first month or so, I tried to ignore everything, but couldn't. I slowly tried to talk to her nicely about how it was bothering me, but she physically and emotionally hurt me by saying extremly rude things, wouldn't understand, walking away when I am trying to talk to her, and saying ""I am your grandmother, I can talk to you however I want to"".

I asked my dad to talk to her for me, but she would be like""Stop telling me how to talk to my grandkids. I know how to do things."" My mother, wouldn't even hear what I had to say.

After 4 ish months, it got to the point where my dad was annoyed, I was annoyed, and my sister was also annoyed. So, I started to speak up, I started to treat her as she treated me. I honestly yelled at her because she would yell at me.

It got to the point where my mom was like ""i am sending her back to our home country because she is scared"". I was like, I was actually scared as well. I was scared, cried my self to sleep, tried to spend more time at school (I would go at 8am, come home at 10pm  even if I didn't have to go to school that day), etc.

Now, I found out that my grandma was the reason my grandpa drank. He had to drink and smoke in order to cope with my grandma. He died because of how much he drank. My grandma is the reason her son (my uncle) left the house and won't come back. He was treated like trash by my grandmother. The way she would talk, treat, etc. my uncle is sad.

EDIT --  My mom falls at her (my grandmothers) feet / worships her mother. She is planning on bringing her back soon - not sure when - but my mom expects me to be nice to my grandma and apparently she said sorry.  
I have heard her sorry, she always says sorry with a creepy smile and laughs as soon as we turn around.

My grandmother also worships her brother, his wife, and their 3 daugthers. She always talks so nicely about them, but never have I heard her talk nicely about my dad or my mom.

My grandma is the reason her son (my uncle) left the house and won't come back. He was treated like trash by my grandmother. The way she would talk, treat, etc. my uncle is sad.

EDIT --  My mom falls at her (my grandmothers) feet / worships her mother. She is planning on bringing her back soon - not sure when - but my mom expects me to be nice to my grandma and apparently she said sorry.  
I have heard her sorry, she always says sorry with a creepy smile and laughs as soon as we turn around.

My grandmother also worships her brother, his wife, and their 3 daugthers. She always talks so nicely about them, but never have I heard her talk nicely about my dad or my mom. ",0.0,0.0016804414335638285,0,1

However, the aftermath has been filled with tension and drama, all because I made the decision not to invite my older half-sister (let’s call her Sarah) to my wedding.

Sarah and I share the same dad but have different moms. She lives in a different state with her mom, so we haven't had much opportunity to bond. In fact, I've only met her twice in my life. While I hold no ill will towards Sarah, our relationship simply isn't strong enough to warrant her presence at such an intimate and important event in my life.

When it came time to send out invitations, I made the difficult decision to leave Sarah off the guest list. My parents, who understand the dynamics of our family, supported my decision.

Sure enough, once word got out that Sarah wasn't invited, the backlash was intense. Family members accused me of being selfish and heartless for excluding her, claiming that blood is thicker than water. They argued that even though we aren't close, she is still my sister and should have been included in my special day.

Now, my once tight-knit family is divided, with some members siding with me and others ostracizing me for my decision. While I stand by my choice, I can't help but feel guilty for causing such turmoil within my family.

116,1cljt4e,AITA for cleaning my roommate's bathroom?,"Personally, I think this is a non-issue but now that multiple people have been calling me a jerk over this, I have decided to let the internet judge me:

A little context first. I (27F) rent a house with two other people (32F, 19M). Since our fourth roommate just recently moved out, we have the rule that we all deep-clean the house for the next possible tenant, so that they won't be forced to clean up the last tenant's left behind mess. All good on my side since I clean the upstairs bathroom (the one I mostly use) on a weekly basis anyhow.

Our downstairs bathroom is only frequent by our youngest roommate, so we agreed he'd take care of it.

Now, I'm not sure if it's something to do with the way he was raised or simply his age but... His bathroom is often *filthy*. Like, you open the door and immediately close it again because of the stench. However, I'm not his mom. I won't regularly clean his bathroom for him since he already does comparatively little in terms of shared chores.

However, now with our roommate moved out and me already being in the flow of cleaning, I decided to give his bathroom a rough wipe down too. Now here comes the part where I could have been the asshole.

He came home earlier with his current girlfriend and both immediately noticed it. His girlfriend praised him for **finally** cleaning his bathroom because she was close to doing it herself (her words).

She went into his room and he came into the kitchen to me and asking me why I did that. I told him that

1) We were supposed to deep clean before our new roommate moves in anyway and I was already in the flow and  
2) I like his current girlfriend. He seems to like her too. Maybe this would assist him in keeping her (once again, probably his age, it's his fifth girlfriend since I moved 6 months ago). Keep in mind, I definitely said that in jest and used an overly sarcastic tone (even if I might have been a bit fed up with often having to clean up after him DESPITE regularly reminding him to do a few more chores).

Now, I can see how the last part could have been asshole-ish but once again: This kid is 19 and if even his girlfriend says that she now feels comfortable using his bathroom, then it should be a wake up call. I don't expect him to have the same cleaning standards as us ""more adult"" people. But that's no excuse to live in filth.

I have a cousin (39 F) who I grew up with and see as a sister, she helped me with my homework, picked me up from the bus, did my hair and hung out with me all the time etc etc. ( I didn’t have any siblings until much later in my life so I have a big age gap with them) but with my cousin I didn’t really feel lonely especially cus my parents worked a lot. (To add to this my cousin was the translator of the family growing up she would do everything for our family, go to doctors appointments, fill out paper work, translate, help with lawyers or tax stuff.. all of that stuff that shouldn’t have been put on her) 

Anyway my cousin was in an abusive relationship and the guy (let’s call him E) even went to jail for hurting my cousin. There was evidence and pictures and as a kid I obviously witnessed some of the abuse. Finally the guy went to jail when my cousin decided it was enough and reported him. 


So some time went by and I hear from my mom that the guy opened up a cafe in their neighborhood and that she and a couple of my family members went to check it out and to not tell my cousin…. I started telling my mom that I was really disappointed in her behavior and that it was embarrassing that they were all out supporting a convicted abuser and if that is the same attitude she would ever give a man who abused me or my sisters? after I said all I needed to say I heard her whimper and say “ok” before we both hung up. 

Now as Mother’s Day approaches I haven’t heard from her and she hasn’t called me but she’s been telling my sister (while crying) that I love my cousin more than her because I’m taking my cousins side. I’ve never had the best relationship with my mom and it’s been better since I’m an adult now, so I’m wondering if I should just apologize and bring peace again.. any advice would be very helpful.

Everytime those photos or my actions were brought up I told my friends to delete them and please never post/talk about them but they never listened.

(they arent illegal or anything explicit, just very embarassing)

I have left that friend group now and joined a new one that is a lot more accepting than my old one. I felt a lot more comfortable with them too as they didnt know about the photos or anything like that. One girl (f16) from my old group is pretty close with my new group and I still talk to her

A few weeks ago she sent a bunch of photos again in our dms, I told her that I wanted her to delete them and she didnt, a week ago she hinted at some embarassing things I did to the new friend group and said she would try to find the videos. I then again messaged her privately telling her to please not tell them anything, and that I was sick of being embarrassed of the things I did back then.

Now 2 days ago she decided to send all of the photos she had of me into a groupchat with my new friends, they saved the photos and laughed at me because of them. I begged them all to delete the photos from the groupchat (which they all did) and I told them to delete them from their camera rolls too, but I cant tell if they listened or not.

I got really upset at my friend for posting the photos even after I told her so many times that I wanted her to delete them.

She told me it was funny, I told her that I have said multiple times that I hate those photos and now my new friends know about them and now I feel super embarrassed about it now.

I feel like she doesnt care about how I feel at all, and I feel that she doesnt care about how her actions affect how people think about me as long as they find her funnier.

AITA for refusing to speak to her after this? Am I being too sensitive or am I actually justified in thinking shes a bad person and friend to me??



Edit: thank you all for the nice comments, I will try speaking to her in person about how I feel about it because she clearly does not listen to me when I message her about it, I know that a lot of people at my school also did embarrassing stuff like me at that age which it why it sucks so much that im the only one whos put on blast for it, in fact the friend who sent the photos has even complained about how she acted in the same time period. I'm sad that its something that I know feel insecure about it instead of being able to see it as me just being a child and acting dumb. Even if I get my new friend group and friend who originally posted them to delete the photos my old friend group still has the photos, so I guess I will just have to deal with it until they mature enough to realise how much of an asshole they were all being.

I’m too tired to remember anything. Give me some slack. The fact I can even remember your name is lucky!” I’m getting so annoyed by it that I’m about to snap. AITA?

120,1cli7qm,AITA for yelling and cursing at my brother after he told his wife that I'm adopted?,"I live in a country, and English is my second self-learned language sorry if there are errors, where being adopted is taboo and is looked at in a very negative light. The fact that nobody in our biological families wanted is said to show something is wrong with us. It's seen as this ultimate sin and there are a few ""nicknames"" used for those of us who are adopted and none of them are kind. It dates back generations and while maybe some parts of this are improving, it's not felt right now. It's ingrained in the people around me. It's something discussed in certain ways in our schools and taught as a very big negative. So adoption is very secretive in my country. Most people don't tell anyone about being adopted. You can have a very hard time living here if you are known as an adoptee and some people even lose or get chased out of their jobs.

My parents adopted me when my brother was 7. I'm 17f now. My brother is their biological son. So he has always known. He also is very aware of the stigma and I remember him bringing up things he heard when he still lived at home with our parents and me. He'd ask lots of questions too. We have always been very quiet about the fact I'm adopted and I look enough like my family that nobody assumes. It also helps that nobody really knew until the very end that my mama was pregnant with my brother because she wasn't showing. So my parents just said the pregnancy had been risky and they kept it quiet so not to shame the family if they lost me (pregnancy loss is also stigmatized but not as much).

My brother has been married for a year. He and his wife were visiting us with her parents for a dinner. Her parents were very rude throughout the first hour of the visit and once we were eating they started spewing nasty things about me being an adoptee. It was a very big shock and my parents were outraged and told them to leave. But they were refusing until they said things. My brother was looking at me and I asked him how they knew and he admitted he told his wife and he knew she'd tell them because she tells her parents everything. His wife's parents were disgusted I was talking to him and eventually my parents had to really force them to leave. My brother's wife said nothing and my brother was apologizing to me and I asked how he could do that to me. He said he needed to tell his wife even if it came a year into the marriage. I told him he risked my reputation but not his own with that honesty and he started getting upset and I was already upset and he told me it would blow over, right as his wife's parents yelled out that they would make sure people knew about me. That made me lose it and I told my brother I hated him and he damned me publicly with his honesty and I didn't want to see him. He yelled out before I left the room that I wasn't being fair and to put myself in his shoes.

For most of this time, they've had boyfriends on and off with only one of them being in a long-term relationship that is kind of one-sided.

I've been with my boyfriend for a while now and they always seem to make harmless jokes about how we sound like the definition of a perfect couple or something just because we haven't broken up yet and go on trips together.

Last week we gathered and my boyfriend came over because he forgot his charger and they all stared at him and made their teasing jokes. He went with it not to cause any issues and left afterwards. My friend, let's call her Lola, said how I should be grateful to have a man like that. That not everyone was so fortunate.

I was confused where this was coming from but I went with it until she asked me why I don't talk about my relationship problems or pretend like they don't exist. I just said I don't want to and they're not severe enough for me to seek emotional support.

Ever since then, they've had this weird bitter attitude towards me even in the group chat and I feel uncomfortable around them. I told them I don't like their jokes but they just say I'm sensitive and taking it too seriously.

122,1clhqu9,AITA for Wanting to Prioritize Maternity Leave Over Work?,"Hi Reddit,

I need some perspective on a situation with my husband regarding maternity leave.

I (32F) and my husband (35M) have been together for over 8 years. When we discussed starting a family, I made it clear that I wanted to take advantage of the maternity leave benefits in our country, which include a maximum of 4 months fully paid leave, followed by additional time off to care for our baby and manage household duties (without pay). My plan was to be in that situation for at least a year. He agreed to this plan.

However, now that I'm pregnant, he's expressing a different opinion. He doesn't want me to stop working after the initial maternity leave period. This has left me conflicted, especially considering my concerns about leaving such a small baby in someone else's care.

Currently, I handle a full-time job, household chores, pet care, and even pursue extra studies in my dream career. Unfortunately, I had to pause my university studies due to time constraints and exhaustion.

I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for wanting to prioritize maternity leave and bonding time with our baby over returning to work immediately. 
Just to be clear, we can do it financially without any issue...so I'm being stubborn.

She’s a very controlling person with a lot of trauma from the relationship with my father. She doesn’t accept things not going her way, ever. 

However, we agreed that she should come visit me and my boyfriend for a week in 2 weeks because Mother’s Day is that weekend. Unfortunately, we forgot that my boyfriend has a birthday party he promised to attend that weekend and he would be back on the evening of the Mother’s Day. I agree that we should have double-check but we had not. 

I texted my mom to confirm if she’s coming and also explained that there’s an update and we can either go for the dinner together on Mother’s Day (just the two of us) or maybe we can change the day and go next evening with my boyfriend accompanying us. 

She’s now throwing a tantrum saying I took all her happiness away as I can’t even keep my promise for such an important day. She’s also saying she is ashamed to admit in front of her friends (who she bragged about this dinner to apparently) that I did such a thing and that she is heartbroken. 

I can’t see how it’s such a problem as I gave her two options and she declined both. I know her and I know she’s now trying to guilt trip me into convincing my boyfriend to cancel his plans.

They allowed him to pursue his hobbies whatever he wanted on the other hand I was basically groomed to be a slave to my future husband they didn't let me do anything of my interest always making me cook food or making me clean the house and stuff. 
They also didn't allow me to hang out with my friends and basically tried to keep me locked in the house 24*7. My brother also started acting like he was superior to me and always ordered me to do stuff like clean his room and I would get scolded if I didn't comply. 
Well I had enough and ran away from home at 17 to live with my bf. His parents showed me what true parental love was, they helped me finish my education and gave me a part time job as they had a business that payed well. At no point did they contact me to find out how or where I am. 
Once I graduated uni, I joined their business full time so did my bf. The paycheck was huge and since they had brains they also helped me invest a chunk of it to let it grow. 
I got married to my bf when we were 21 and at the same time his parents retired from the business and he and I took over. 
We bought a new home and moved in. I had my daughter at 23 we basically spent last 3-4 years growing the business so it's now at a point where we can take as many vacations as we want in a year and we are extremely well off. 
5 months ago, my brother contacted me via Facebook, asked if I wanted to reconnect I agreed hesitantly. Well what happened when we met was he told me he has a 5 year old boy and is struggling with debt and bills and asked for help, I felt bad so I did start helping him by paying for his groceries and even covering 40% of his rent. 
Last month we went on a vacation to spain we uploaded pics from our trip, he saw them and when we came back basically tried to ambush me in front of my house saying I could've helped him more but instead here I was taking vacation without breaking a sweat, my husband bombarded him with insults and said we wont be giving him a cent from now on,he left. 
Three days ago, he sent me a long and emotional message about how he is struggling to feed his family and how it's unfair I have so much and he has so little. I haven't replied to it yet.

No one ever agrees with her and my husband and I came to the conclusion that she just thinks that complaining makes her look cool or something.

Yesterday, we ate at a Vietnamese restaurant and my mom immediately started making fun of the waitstaff by mimicking their language when they would speak to each other.

She brushed me off but I could tell she was embarrassed because I even thought I quietly corrected her, everyone could tell that I did. I guess because she was embarrassed she started doubling down on her behavior to act like she was never wrong to begin with. A waitress came and took her drink that was empty and only had ice in it. My mom got upset at the waitress and loudly told her she wasn’t finished with her drink and that she was waiting for the ice to melt. The waitress apologized to my mom and said she can bring her another drink but my mom wouldn’t let it go.

I was so embarrassed by my mom that I apologized to the manager and waitress in front of her. My husband did as well. 

Now my mom is now mad at me saying that she did nothing wrong and that I embarrassed her in front of everyone by doing that.

Guess what? She freaking drank it after I told her no MULTIPLE times. I literally told her that I'm saving it for myself. She said I was selfish for getting mad about this small matter.

130,1clfp2r,WIBTA If I didn’t invite my father to my graduation? ,"Some context: I (22M) am set to graduate from college this weekend coming up and I’m the first in my immediate family to go to college. My father(55m) used to be an alcoholic and would take out his anger and frustration verbally not physically on my deceased mother (Passed away in 2021) and I when I was younger up until my teens when I stopped interacting with him as much. In all of our hobbies I shared with him like videos games or working on my car he would belittle me and prop himself up  whenever I did anything incorrectly or not up his standards, in other instances as well he would call me failure because I didn’t play any sports after school and that my mother didn’t raise me right and he is going to be more involved with my younger brother(13M). He did end up apologizing to me when I was around 20 for the way he treated me during my childhood. 

Flash forward to today it’s been three years since my mother has passed and he has been dating around for a couple years and had a couple of new relationships. I commute to school so a nice and quiet study area in my house would be preferable so I can focus and maintain my decent grades. But he insists on only having his new girlfriends coming over to our house to hang out with them and he never goes to their house. I live in a pretty small two bedroom household with pretty thin walls, with the door closed you can hear everything in the house. Our bedrooms are right next to each other so I can clearly hear everything him and his girlfriend get up to. A couple of weeks ago during one of my big exam weeks before finals I heard all of the stuff him and his girlfriend got up to despite his subpar attempt to blast music to try to cover it up. Now it’s finals week and he’s still inviting his girlfriend over, and I can hear them talking, blasting the tv and face fucking each other while I’m trying to take tests. My brother complains to me as well about overhearing him and his girlfriend as well. 

My conflict stems from the deal I made with him and my mom before I started school, they agreed to pay my car insurance and cell phone bill while I’m in school and maintain good grades (which I have),he does hold his end of the bargain as well. My tuition was payed for my mother using her inheritance from my grandfather. But because of his recent blatant disrespect potentially costing me my grades I want to revoke his invite to my graduation.

My wife grew up doing a lot of them. She pretty much never had ""free time"" and her parents are pretty against it for kids. She did gymnastics, softball, basketball, soccer, dance and music growing up. My family were more laid back and that worked for me. I swam and did art sometimes. But none of it was super competitive and serious. My wife did a lot of more competitive stuff and was always serious and going for pro.

When we were discussing kids she wanted the kids to be raised the same as her. I didn't agree with that. So we agreed we wouldn't force it on them, we wouldn't overwhelm them (2 or 3 at absolute most at a time) and we wouldn't make them do the more competitive sports teams if they didn't want to but if they wanted to it wouldn't be stopped either.

We have four boys. Our older two are very into sports and they take it seriously and want to play on serious teams. But our younger boys are the opposite and really don't like team sports. One favors swimming and the other favors rock climbing. But neither want to do either seriously. My wife wanted them to follow in their older brothers footsteps and at least do football on the serious team their brothers were part of and have since progressed from. I disagreed and referenced back to our prior agreement. She disagreed with me and said they need to be on teams and should be more serious about sport.

My wife brought her parents into this and all three of them tried to tell me why I was wrong. ILs said kids with free time are going to grow up to be delinquents and I was the exception to that. They also said the younger boys aren't going to be tough enough for high school and beyond if they don't learn something more solid in terms of sports. I asked what any of this had to do with them being tough and was ignored.

My wife said I was being disagreeable for no reason and so unreasonable. I grew frustrated and told her she was using her parents to gang up on me and that we had an agreement and she was refusing to stick to it even though I never interfered in what our older boys wanted. She told me they made the right choices. She wanted our younger boys to do the same. She said they're missing out on the pressure that all kids need to experience young and the expectation that being part of a serious team brings. Her parents said my wife is right and I need to see sense and stop being selfish.

I lost my temper and told my ILs this had nothing to do with them and told my wife she was totally wrong for bringing her parents into this and trying to back me into a corner and I was not okay with any of it.

Dony lives with her mother mainly but comes to us alot. My husband has a business of his own with good  profit.

Time by time we started noticing that the money  in the house is getting less and less. Like I count a pack and it’s 5K for example next day it’s 4.8K. Then 4.2K and so on and I noticed that the amount magically shrinks whenever Dony comes. To make share I didn’t change the place where we kept our money, I counted it very precisely before she arrived. After she arrived and left I counted again and 200 were missing. 

Now the thing is my husband thought that the lady that comes to help us with cleaning every week is the one stealing because she is the only that enters our house (he didn’t doubt his daughter). And he wanted to fire her. 

So I went to Dony confronted her about the money, she denied at first but then she did say the truth that she indeed stole but has already spent them and has only 400 left.

However, she refused saying that she can’t hurt her image infront of her father I told her if she doesn’t say it, I will and gave her 1 week before the lady visits us.

The father and daughter fought and Dony never bothered to apologize. Dony then sent a lengthy text calling me horrible for outing her and destroying her relationship with her father.

My boyfriend (24m) and I (22f) have been dating for three years, but we’ve know each other about five. Our relationship has been pretty solid with some fights here and there, but nothing we haven’t been able to get past. 

One issue that keeps coming up is my relationship with the truth. Frankly put, I have extreme social anxiety and one of the ways it manifests is in me being super reticent to being vulnerable and not wanting to put a spotlight on myself. My boyfriend is amazing and I trust him completely, so this isn’t an issue for us or any of my other close relationships, but for example, I didn’t tell him that I was a vegetarian (and had been for 3 years) until the day we started dating. 

I felt like since I was always able to eat something at the restaurants we chose to go to, it didn’t need to be brought up. It was something that I was embarrassed about thanks to all of the mocking vegan/vegetarian posts of the early 2010s, but even though I was telling a white lie, a lie of omission, it felt like a fairly neutral choice overall with just a sprinkle of negativity. But I thought sparing me the embarrassment was worth enough good to outweigh that. He was upset about what he considered to be a full lie, and I haven’t told him one since. 

The problem is, it’s not that easy for me to stop doing so with the people I’m not close with. Even thinking about it makes my heart beat out of my chest, and I don’t know how to bring the omissions up. I hate making things about myself or revealing any abnormal things that would make the detail (and myself) the center of the conversation rather than just being additional context to the conversation. I’m not consciously trying to push his boundaries, but telling lies to anyone, even though I don’t to him, is understandably worrying in a relationship. 

Here’s where I might be TA. Last night, we got into a huge fight over me not telling my coworkers that the reason I’m going to Atlanta (I’m taking off Wed-Fri) is for my graduation. I’ve told them truths about me going to meet up with family, go to six flags, the coke museum, etc, but I am admittedly leaving out the central reason for the trip. I just can’t bear the thought of the making a big deal of it and telling everyone and having to have that conversation over, and over again. Not only that, but I’m worried it makes me seem like a less serious employee and belittles the fact that I already graduated in December but my school only holds the ceremony once a year. 

I eventually conceded to telling them the full truth, but he said that he doesn’t care what I tell them at this point. The fact that I’m lying to them and (initially) defending it makes me a huge jerk.

Back then I said „thats the deal!“ and didnt think any more of that because for me its been like a silly joke. Now we are in our thirties. She just turned 30 last month and is the single one, while I am married. Yesterday she reminded me of the deal what we had 10 years ago and I jokingly replied, that she can move in tomorrow. She then said that she would need couple of days to pack all the stuff that she needs and she would move in with us. Because I realized how serious she been I asked if she meant it serious because for me its a joke and of course she cant move in with me and my husband. She then accused me of being a bad friend because I didnt keep my promise from 10 years ago and she would have let me moved in if she was the married one and I single. Then I told her that even though I appreciate that I wouldnt expect her to do that because I understand that I have nothing to do in someone’s household as a grown ass women. I also explained her that I didnt expect her that she meant it dead ass serious because for me its common sense that this is not serious. There are so many aspects that need to be considered (space, my partner etc.) and also at some point everyone has their own life. She didnt took it well and offered that she could be our maid, I refused. I apologized for not making it clear that it wasnt a serious „promise“ for me and if she needs any help in the future I am ok with her staying temporarily but not permanently. She still thinks I am the worst friend now that doesnt keep her promises and leaves her hanging down.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-06,"AITA for not keeping a „promise“ with my best friend that was made 10 years ago? My best friend and I are in our early thirties. When we were young (around our twenties) we were both single at that time for a long long time. She then said that if one of us is still single when we hit thirty and the other one is not, then the married one „adopts“ the single one, so neither of us would stay alone. Back then I said „thats the deal!“ and didnt think any more of that because for me its been like a silly joke. Now we are in our thirties. She just turned 30 last month and is the single one, while I am married. Yesterday she reminded me of the deal what we had 10 years ago and I jokingly replied, that she can move in tomorrow. She then said that she would need couple of days to pack all the stuff that she needs and she would move in with us. Because I realized how serious she been I asked if she meant it serious because for me its a joke and of course she cant move in with me and my husband. She then accused me of being a bad friend because I didnt keep my promise from 10 years ago and she would have let me moved in if she was the married one and I single. Then I told her that even though I appreciate that I wouldnt expect her to do that because I understand that I have nothing to do in someone’s household as a grown ass women.

137,1clefcj,AITA for not letting a stranger's kid to use my card in a play zone/arcade,"Yesterday, I (17M) took my cousins (7F and 2M) to a play zone + arcade in a mall while our parents were shopping. My brother is very mischievous and handling both, him and my sister at the same time is a very difficult task. 

I got a play zone and arcade card. He started playing in a game car. A stranger was standing right next to the car with her kid. My sister wanted me to get her a teddy bear from the claw machine so I took her there and when I turned back to look if my brother was fine I saw the stranger's kid in the car which I paid for my brother to play and he was watching the kid and his mother with a sad face so I immediately went up to him to ask what happened and he said that the mother got him off the car and made his son ride it. 

I politely asked the woman to get her kid off the car as I paid for it for my brother and not her kid. She told me that she didn't have a card while her kid continued riding the car. I asked her to get one but she started explaining how her boyfriend left her and now she is a single mom and it is very difficult for her to raise a kid and pay for all this stuff. 

I didn't want to be rude so I just let him play and took my brother to another game. Again the same woman came and got her kid to play the game instead of my brother while I was busy with my sister. I again politely asked the woman to get her kid off the game but she denied and again started explaining me the same thing. I got really pissed off and asked her to get him off or I will have to talk to the arcade manager to get her out. She started shouting at me and told me that I am a very cruel, cold-hearter person for not letting her kid have fun. I calmly said that I paid for my cousins to enjoy not some stranger's kid and it's not my fault if she can't pay for it. Everybody in the arcade was looking at us and she got out of the arcade while murmuring.

138,1cldr0g,AITA for paying for SO's detox from our joint account?,"Hi all, 

I've got no idea whether I'm at wrong or not anymore. 



SO is addicted to alcohol and started another binge drinking episode which lasted in total 8 days. On day 8, I was bombarded by constant ""help me, please"" every 5 minutes, so I did my best to help. 

I agreed first on day 5 to his idea of ""give me 1.5 day, I will be sober but I need to reduce the alcohol amount slowly"". Long story short it didn't work and 2 days later he was as drunk as before. I gave him options: detox at home, ER, detox centre, detox in a private medical facility, or he stops drinking, no more ""cutting off slowly"". I asked if he has other ideas - he didn't. He didn't agreed to anything but after ca. 12h of more drinking he agreed to the private facility idea, which cost nearly 5k for 3 days. 

Now he's out after 2 days, blaming me for ""being firvulous with money"" and that if I  had given him another 3 days he would be bored of drinking enough to stop on his own. He says it's my fault, that I decided to pay by myself as he was under the influence and unable to consent. Now he's bringing it up constantly since yesterday that I have to ""reimburse him"" or ""find a way to pay off my debt"".

 The issue is we've got a joint account and my entire salary goes there, we're both taking an amount for a month for basic needs only (to save money for our own place not because we're struggling financially, we've got some savings, he's bringing more money than I do as he's older and has more work experience so he works on a higher postion). I /could/ find a second job on top of the one I do full time or sell some of my stuff like books or idk stop eating but I feel like that's completely unfair. But maybe I'm in the wrong and am acting the vitctim, idk. So, aita for paying for the detox from our joint finances?

139,1cld9qx,AITAH for setting boundaries on when my SO’s friends can come over,"When I was pregnant my SO would go out and party maybe 3 times a week.  This upset me because I felt left out.  This turned into him bringing the party to our house. After that, I set strict boundaries on when people could be over: **people can be over ANY time, except after 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday (the nights before workdays).** I now have a baby. My SO still likes to have one specific friend over. This friend shows up at like 8 or 9 pm and stays until 2 in the morning.  
Sometimes my SO and this friend go out drinking on weekdays, and he will still come over after drinking, and they will stay up until two in the morning.

When this friend comes over on the *weekends* I don’t complain and they stay up as late as they want.  It upsets me when he comes over *during the weekday after 9 p.m.* when I’ve asked both of them not to do that.

I don’t like it because 1. I actually do have a baby and the house does need to be quiet 2. Even if they’re trying to be quiet I can hear them and it wakes me up, which is frustrating because I’m already sleep deprived with the baby/my work.  3. It feels bad to be disregarded.

My SO guilts me and says “I guess I’m just not allowed to have friends” which is bs because his friends are allowed over all DAY everyday and even ALL night on Friday and Saturday nights.

I also unfortunately resent his friend. I think he is a little creepy (he is trying to buy a house near ours). But I also feel replaced by him. My SO and I used to go out and party and go on fun trips; life was fun, careless, and exciting. Ever since I got pregnant, this friend has replaced me.  Now I stay home while my SO goes out and 1 to 2 times a week with this friend. He has even gone on a couple of vacations with this friend. I feel like the part of my husband that I fell in love with is no longer available to me.    It hurts and feels lonely.  And every other weekend that friend is here for at least one night  if not two and sometimes all weekend .   I feel a little jealous of his friend and even resentful that I lost that part of my husband.    So when my SO brings home over after 9 pm on a weekday.. it feels extra insulting.  Like “salt in a wound.”

Anyway… I got upset tonight that his friend showed up at 8 tonight and stayed until 11.  I actually agreed to stay up late tonight (forgoing my sleep) so I could watch a movie with my SO.. I pictured us having some nice alone time..  and his friend just… stuck around for the whole movie. But he at least let me sit on the couch next to my SO.

My SO is a good dad fwiw… and except for the fact that he doesn’t understand why all of these things upset me, he is a good partner.    He just doesn’t understand why I set these boundaries and he clearly doesn’t think they need to respected… he even told me tonight that he never agreed to them.  He also said “this is MY house.”  I’m starting to feel crazy. AITAH?

140,1clct8o,AITA for singing to Kung fu fighting?,"I (18M) recently had a family vacation over spring break with some members of the extended family. I'm chinese-filipino and my parents decided to get a VRBO to have a big family vacation with my paternal grandparents, one of my dad's brothers and his family, and two of my mom's sisters and their families. All in all there were 18 of us in the house for a four day period. (Two chinese grandparents, my dad(Chinese)'s brother and his wife and their three daughters, my mom(Filipino)'s married sister and her husband and their twin boy and girl, my single aunt, and me and my 3 siblings plus my parents). 

It was on the second day when the incident happened. My older cousin (19F, Filipino, one of the twins) and I were washing dishes just after breakfast as we volunteered to do so. I was in the kitchen setting the plates up next to the dish and I was humming the lyrics to Kung Fu Fighting. I sang 'Those kicks were fast as lightning. Nananananananana, in funky china town..."" because I saw a video my friend sent me, and I'm not necessarily comfortable with the original 'chinamen' lyrics. My cousin said that I was being inappropriate because I clearly sang a sogn with a slur

I argued that I didn't, I tried to avoid the slur, and I was wondering how she could have heard me when she was opening a trash bag nearby. She stormed out of the kitchen with her phone in hand and demanded that the rest of our family listen to the lyrics to understand how bad I 'messed up'.

My grandparents really enjoyed the song and were singing it to themselves throughout the day, but her brother agreed that it was messed up. My dad and mom's generation couldn't care less but my cousin was fuming. She said she wouldn't drive me to the restaurant we were all supposed to go to after I did a workout. My single aunt (Filipino) agreed to take me from the gym I was going to visit to the restaurant because she said she was just goign to daydrink if she didn't get her hands on a car.

So a couple of hours later after my workout my aunt tells me that I shouldn't have been bringing up that song in the first place because it would contribute to a tense situation. She said that as a filipino we have to keep the peace, it's how my parents lasted that long, and that me bringing this up would only bring tension to us all especially 'with how much asian races already hate each other.' I only nodded but didn't necessarily acknowledge that.

I told him to start paying rent and bills as it’s unfair for me to continue paying them whilst also doing all the housework. We both earn pretty fairly. He has debts due to his poor past decisions while I don’t. 

He feels I’m being insensitive for asking him to pay his share as he’s tight on money BUT he would always want to buy nice luxury items. Probably to be perceived as well to do by others.

I told him to start paying rent and bills as it’s unfair for me to continue paying them whilst also doing all the housework. We both earn pretty fairly. He has debts due to his poor past decisions while I don’t. 

He feels I’m being insensitive for asking him to pay his share as he’s tight on money BUT he would always want to buy nice luxury items. Probably to be perceived as well to do by others. 

Yes he pays most of the time when we go out to eat but we don’t eat fancy food anyway.

144,1clcblw,AITA for insinuating that my boyfriend's cousin's gf is not pretty?,"Before passing judgment, please understand that I often struggle to grasp social cues accurately. My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 months, and one of the things that bonds us is our shared sense of dark and dry humor—we playfully tease each other, knowing it's all in good fun. He assured me that his friends share a similar sense of humor. I don’t think it was a lie, He’s wonderful, sweet and the kind of guy you will marry. He’s one of a kind. 



 Last Friday, met the rest of his friends I haven’t yet Matt and Mick  I met last week Johnny, Greg, and Mick's girlfriend, Nicky I haven’t yet, she is someone my boyfriend greatly admires because she encouraged him and supported him while leaving an abusive relationship. 



Nicky is often described as fun, sweet, and fashionable, and my boyfriend's fondness for her made me somewhat jealous . I met Mick and Matt last week and while we were talking and asking about them he showed be the background of his phone a baby picture of Nicky, playfully saying she's ""like this but older and cuter,"" while Matt jokingly expressed regret about not meeting her first due to her awesomeness and beauty.



Fast forward to the gathering at Matt's place, and upon meeting Nicky, I was taken aback by how different she looked from what I had imagined. Nicky was very nice from the very beginning, ngl, complimented me saying, ""It's so nice to have another pretty lady in the group."" All of them agreed and then it clicked it was a joke among them… no to sound like a dick but his guys are gym bros, I nervous laugh and replied, ""Yeah, most likely the first one, right?""



Unfortunately, my attempt at humor fell flat. Nicky's expression turned serious as she asked what I meant by my comment. Feeling increasingly nervous, I tried to explain myself by referencing the remarks made by Mick and Matt about Nicky's appearance. However, my explanation only seemed to worsen the situation. Nicky interpreted my words as disrespectful, and she immediately left taking Mick with her. Shortly after, Greg and Johnny followed suit, leaving an awkward silence among the remaining the three of us.



During the ride home, Tyler was silent and when we were about to arrived he told me how disappointed he was, emphasizing that my comment was hurtful and disrespectful toward someone he deeply cares about. Since then, we haven't spoken, and I'm left wondering if my actions were truly out of line. I genuinely misunderstood the dynamics of the situation and never intended to cause offense.

145,1clc86f,AITA for telling my dad about my mom’s surgery?,"My (22F) parents separated messily (not legally divorced yet) about 10 months ago. They now live in different suburbs of the same city. I am in my senior year of college and live in a different state. Especially since the separation, I am mostly financially and emotionally independent from my parents and I live apart from them year-round, meaning I don’t “come home” for long chunks of time anymore, it’s more like a visit. They more or less hate each other. I also have a younger sister (20F) who can’t drive and lives at home with my mom.
Anyways, my mom is having surgery in a couple of weeks to remove a benign breast tumor. The recovery will not be complicated but she needs someone to drive her and take care of her and her dogs for a couple days afterward. Months ago she asked me if I’d be willing to fly up for about a week to help out and I agreed no problem. My plan is to come a night or two before the surgery, have dinner with my dad for one night while I’m in the area, drive her to her surgery, and help out for several days after, leaving her with a clean house and a freezer full of home-cooked food. 

So the trouble comes when I called my dad a week or so ago to let him know I’ll be in town. This is an unusual time of year for me to visit so he asked me why, and I told him about my mom’s surgery. My parents don’t talk, but when I told my mom I was planning to see him and had told him why I was in town she freaked out and said she felt really betrayed by me telling him and then made some passive aggressive statements about my leaving her “all alone” for a night. Note that this dinner is happening two days before her surgery, I’ll still come back and sleep at her house, and she never told me I wasn’t allowed to tell my dad, I assumed it would be obvious that I would let him know I was in town.

I apologized to her and said that I wished she’d let me know about this boundary because I had no idea she didn’t want him to know about the surgery, but at the same time, it felt wrong to come to town for almost a whole week and never call him to tell him I’m there. I said it makes me feel stressed to be pulled between them like this. She ended the call still being pissed off and then I heard a couple days later that she’d also told my sister how upset she was about the whole thing.
So now I feel horrible because she seems to be really hurt. But at the same time I feel like she really doesn’t understand what a difficult position she put me in by wanting me to secretly come to town without telling my dad but never communicating this to me until it was too late. I work nearly full time on top of school to support myself and I am taking time off from both work and school to do this for her, which I am happy to do, but it felt obvious that I’d have one dinner with my dad while I’m in town. She thinks that I should’ve inherently known that this is sensitive personal information that I shouldn’t share. So AITA?

Edit: Thanks everyone for the discussion. I agree my mom is not being crazy or dramatic! She is normally much more easygoing about these things and my relationship with my dad, but has been stressed out lately and not really herself. I apologized to her for violating her boundaries, she knows I didn’t mean to and we are doing ok now. I’m leaving the post up because I know I’m not supposed to delete but I’m definitely not looking for anyone to tell me that either of us was 100% right here.

146,1clc5yw,AITA for moving into my grandparent's den without permission?,"I (25F) am a freelancer and had to stop working due to an injury. My granddad is a double amputee and my grandma recently had a fall that landed her in rehab and a wheelchair. They both have dementia as well, albeit at different severities. My mom had moved back home to take care of them full time about 7 months prior to my grandma's fall. While my grandma was still in rehab I suggested that I move in with all of them to ease some of the caregiving and financial burden from my mom. My mom was really relieved, and so far things have gone really well. I enjoy living with all of them again, including my 16 year old little sister. I get to spend the last years of my grandparents lives close to them and making them comfortable. 

Here is the issue: We live in a 4 bedroom house. The master suite is really big, and my grandparents share it. They each have their own hospital bed. My sister and my mom both have their own rooms as well. The fourth bedroom was empty for years until I came to live with them.

The ceiling is leaking horribly. It's a heavy leak that seems to have been there for a long time, but my grandparents didn't notice it. I've been in the room for a little over a year now, but according to my mom we really can't afford to get it fixed. I understand that, so I asked her if I could move into the den for the time being. We have 4 sitting rooms, and of of them is conveniently empty and tucked away onto a side of the house. It could easily be mistaken for another bedroom, and it's much bigger and I would even have my own door. Plus, we'd still have 2 more sitting rooms. (My mom has taken over one of them as an office.)

My mom told me that she'd have to think about it. Every time I ask her about it, she waves me off or tells me all the decorating plans she has for that room and that she'd hate to give them up. Meanwhile I'm sleeping with my bed in the only corner that isn't leaking and waking up to empty the bucket when it rains. 

It rained last night, and I just got fed up and dragged my bed and a few of my things into that room and slept there.  My mom flipped out on me in the morning and demanded that I put everything back, and told me that I was wasting my time and energy when we had so much to get done that day. I get that she's stressed because of the strain that caregiving puts on her, but I do just as much work as she does. I am quite literally pulling just as much weight and it's stressful to work all day long and have to sleep under a leaking ceiling while everyone else sleeps peacefully. My granddad was lucid this morning, and he yelled at me a bit too. He doesn't really understand the full picture, he just knows I did something without his or my mom's permission. I talked to my sister and my best friend though, and they think that I was too combative and I tried to force the change on my family who is already stressed out when I should've waited for their permission when they were ready.

So I (f/24) live with my boyfriend (m/25) we have been together for around 2 years now. It has been a known fact that my bf smokes pot and does psychedelics. He also sells to his friends both. I do not smoke or do anything but drink, this is because when I was around 17 I overdosed and have been clean since. When I was bad on drugs around 15-17 my vice of choice was Molly, X, and cocaine. I have been clean since 17 so around 7years. Today my bf and I were at the bar around 11pm, we had been drinking all day as it is cinco de mayo. He decided to tell me while in the bar half way through a pitcher while playing pool that he needed to get a drug test kit. I quickly stated what do you mean and what for? He stated that he traded some pot for a handful of X pills a couple of days ago and he needed to test them before selling and also added in we could take a couple while at a upcoming concert. Now it should be known that I’ve told him of my past with drugs multiple times. I quickly got upset and worried and asked if these were in our home, which he replied yes. I asked why he waited until we were intoxicated to mention anything about this and why he didn’t tell me the day it happened. He said he didn’t think anything of it, I should also mention I have a 5 year old daughter and that these pills where in the house while she was with us. I became very upset at the bar and demanded to get them out of our house tonight. At home he was angry at me for being upset so I began to cry and have a panic attack. Am I the asshole for becoming so upset over this or am I overreacting and should have calmly handled the situation??

151,1clbvw9,WIBTA for firing a bridesmaid?,"My FH’s older sister (32F) is one of my bridesmaids. We’ve all known each other 14 years. I started dating him because he was my best friend. My FH and this sister are signed onto a mortgage together. Their parents gifted 3 of the siblings the down payment for them to buy a house together and she couldn’t get approved for the mortgage on her own. 

She is always doing little petty things that get under my skin. It bugs me to death but I let them go in the name of peace. She’s outdone herself this time.  

He moved out but has allowed her to keep the mortgage as it is until rates go down. Then she will refinance and take him off. She says she has every intention of refinancing by the end of next year. Two days ago, she called him and asked him to sign a binding document that says he has no rights to the house (even though he will still be on the deed and named on the mortgage), or to have me sign a prenup so I “can’t try to come for her house” if we get divorced before she refinances. 

I have never been against the idea of a prenup and my FH and I have talked about it. I don’t want anything from him. We make just about the same amount of money (I may even make a little more). I know that, if anything were ever to happen, we would make sure each other was taken care of. He and I agreed that we don’t see the need for one. But now, 28 DAYS until the wedding, she is trying to stiff arm us into one over her $250k money pit that has a year and some change paid off on it. 

I can’t imagine having someone who truly believes that I would do something so unbelievable being my bridesmaid. The people who stand by you are supposed to be the ones who will support you through your marriage, and she is already trying to put precautions in place in case we get divorced before the end of next year. The word “divorce” is being thrown around more in the past two days than it has in our entire relationship, 4 weeks from the wedding. 

I want my FH to tell her that, if she really thinks so poorly of his choice in a wife, she should just start the process of refinancing now. Then, I want to tell her that it doesn’t make sense to me to have someone stand in support of our marriage who believes it is fully possible we could be divorced in less than a year and a half.

After this, no more bets were made. I told Joe that he owes me $90. Joe disagrees, and believes that he only owes me $45. That is, Joe believes that he owes the original wager amount $15 x 3.

She doesn't back down from her ideas if someone tells her no, even if she knows she doesn't actually want it. Katie is extremely girly, and LOVES her long hair. I know for a fact she'd be completely devastated if we were to actually cut her hair (even a less extreme shorter haircut would probably upset her, she's obsessed with having 'Rapunzel hair'). So, obviously, I told her no. I explained to her why this isn't a good idea, and told her how long it would take to grow back. Developmentally, she's not able to fully comprehend the permanence of a choice like this. She didn't like this answer, and has been whining and begging about it for weeks ever since. I keep telling her no. My husband, however, is a 'they'll only do it once' kind of parent. I agree with this approach for some things (ex: when my oldest son was 6, he was insisting on sitting on the counter. After getting him down several times, we eventually left him to get down by himself. He fell, but wasn't hurt, and didn't climb on things anymore). This, however, I don't think is one of those things. He thinks that once the scissors come out, she'll realize it's a bad idea and back out, and if she doesn't, 'it's just hair. I think it would be cruel to do something we know would upset her just because it's a quicker lesson than riding it out and letting her learn that not all ideas are good ideas, and that she doesn't have to do everything her siblings do.

My friends and I were holding a medieval battle and we were really excited. So basically my friend who I kicked out (I’ll call them friend 1) was really late, which I understood, they had just gotten back from a funeral. Then when I showed Friend 1 my new fish tank and told them to guess what was inside…

They said, quote “I don’t care what’s inside, I want to kill it” 

(Inside were brine shrimp eggs)
I told them “get out of my house, text your mom to come back and get you”

I had a massive mental breakdown 

Friend 1 basically said “it’s just a joke chill” 

Then, when they went home they texted me they were sorry

I did not accept their apology as I believe that my brine shrimp are like my babies, I have had them for about 2-3 days and I love them so much.

I also said that in order for us to continue being friends I needed them to be better about doing things like this (please note, that friend 1 had been doing this shit for a while)

Well now their mom is involved and told me “what you said wasn’t ok” 
And I understand why she was upset cause I was talking to friend 1 in a way that their mom didn’t approve of…

I brought up all the other times that friend 1 has been like this but I have not gotten a response 

Friend 1 doesn’t know that their mom replied to me on their phone, so I might show friend 1 screenshots I took of our conversation 

So please please please I have been second guessing myself all day and I need to know,

Am I the asshole here? And if so what can I do to make it better

Dan is turning 17 in a month and my mom is going to give her car to him. She recently got the car off of Facebook marketplace from a guy that had multiple cars up for sale (and still does have some available). It is a manual ford truck. The car itself has a good transmission and only is a bit beat up on the outside with some rust. She has told me several times that the car is Dan's when he turns 17 and that she would put it in his name as soon as he got his full license.

Dan does, from what I know, not know that the car is going to him. The problem with all this is that he gets very frustrated with it being a manual. This has led him to not want to drive the car at all and refuses to continue driving lessons. I, however, have been begging my mom to let me drive and I've gotten pretty good at it. This prompted a conversation between me and my mom after a driving lesson for me. She said that if Dan didn't try to actually learn how to drive the car that she wouldn't even tell him that it was going to be his.

My problem with this is that I know how bad Dan wants to get a job, save up and move out. I don't want him to miss out on a chance to have more independence. I also don't want to go behind my mom and tell him. On one hand me and Dan are close and I feel bad not saying anything at all but he is difficult to talk to sometimes when it comes to this topic. 

I would like to add that we are is no ways rich and this would be a major luxury for Dan. I have a very hard working single mother. This would be more of a struggle for my mom to cover the cost of buying a ""new"" car for herself + me and my other siblings along with the insurance for both.

But I don’t know what to do, I’m kinda in a rock and a hard place. I’m 15 years old and still don’t know what to do. I just really want some outside opinions.",0.0,-0.008272147737443447,0,1
161,1cl9puj,AITA for taking a step back from helping one of my best friends with her wedding the week before? ,"One of my close friends, let’s call her Ellie (26f), is getting married (in my back yard) in about a week. She chose 3 bridesmaids for her wedding who have not been super involved. However, me (23f), Adelia (23f) (her sister), and Bianca (25f) are not in the wedding but have been busting our asses to make sure Ellie’s bridal shower, engagement party, and bachelorette parties have all been special for her. Even though none of us were chosen to be bridesmaids, we put that aside because we are her friends and respected that decision. We have spent countless hours and hundreds of dollars on celebrating Ellie the past few months. Without a complaint, even though her bridesmaids have done the absolute bare minimum, we decided to keep our mouths shut in favor of the bride because she should not have to stress about her wedding party. 

Fast forward to this weekend. Bianca (25f) asked last month if we could all celebrate her birthday at a bar this saturday. Everyone, including Ellie, one of her bridesmaids (the bridesmaid who has done the least), and a few other mutual friends, agreed to come celebrate Bianca for the night. The day of the party, Ellie decided she did not want to stay out late and backed out of the birthday party. Bianca, stayed quiet despite being upset after all the time and money she’s spent celebrating Ellie. Adelia, Ellie’s sister, sent a message to Ellie letting her know that Bianca was upset because of her decision to back out of the party last minute. A few hours later, we realize that every person who agreed to go out was at Ellie’s house having dinner and ghosted Bianca hours before her birthday party. 

Bianca decided to let Ellie know that she was very hurt by her decision to have all of their mutual friends over even though they were supposed to be celebrating Bianca for one night. Ellie flipped the whole story onto Bianca saying, all the friends came over to comfort her because she was “so upset that everyone was mad at her for not going out for Bianca’s birthday”.  This was extremely hurtful because we have all sacrificed many weekends getting things ready for her wedding. 

Now the wedding is a week away and taking place at my house, but I have decided I will be doing the bare minimum to get things ready because the appreciation is clearly not reciprocated. Ellie has already noticed that I am backing off from helping and told others I am being “cold” towards her.. Am I the asshole for deciding to take a step back??

162,1cl9ly8,AITA for not wanting to share the gaming PC?,"Created an account to ask this:
Im 18yo (M) and a month ago I commissioned a gaming pc (I picked every component). I set aside 300 euros for it and my dad spent the remaining 700 euros for it (honestly I didnt expect that to happen, was ready to buy the whole thng myself). Now I have it and its been a blast but to the actual question

My sibling likes to be on pc sometimes and all they do with it is watch shows and use social media on it with no actual gaming (and they have a macbook). Sometimes im fine with it cuz at certain points i do have to get off the pc and do some work. However they p much ask when Im in the middle of gaming/in an online activity. 

Like on saturday, I was on a minecraft server and they asked yet again. I said sure and gimme a bit (I just wanted to return to my base, would've taken maybe like 3 mins or so). Like 30 seconds after they became all whiny and went ""COME ON GET OFF ALREADY"". Has happened a bit when Im playing sekiro in the middle of boss fights and been annoyed by it.

I've tried telling them many times all they stuff they could do can just be done on their macbook and that my gaming pc is meant for well, gaming but they always resist and want to be on it anyways. Am I ass for just wanting the pc to myself at this point?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-06,"AITA for not wanting to share the gaming PC? Created an account to ask this:
