1,1clr84r,"AITA for dressing up in a ""questionable"" group costume per my friends request? *UPDATE*","First I would like to make some clarifications since I didn't mention them in the original post. I am a 22M and Derek is 21 and is the 2nd youngest of his brothers. We were specifically dressed from the 1971 movie with Gene Wilder and Derek and his brothers were the only little people at the party. I had around 30 texts complaining about the costume all of them people I barely know or had only met at the party which had about 150 to 200 people. Out of all those only 3 were just saying Willy Wonka in general is offensive and the rest were accusing me of forcing the idea and wouldn't believe me when I told them it wasn't my idea. Anyways, onto the update. 

A couple minutes after I posted the story I got a call from Derek. He said he had recieved some texts from people from the party regarding the costume, telling him they were messaging me to get me to apologize to him for my ignorance to which he informed them it was his idea. He was then told what happened. 

Apparently, his younger brother, we'll call him Ethan, wasn't wanting to be an Oompa Loompa for the party but got roped into the idea by the others before coming to me and had made a passing comment about it during the party. His comment was either taken as all 4 of them were unhappy with the costume or word spread and got twisted into it being my idea. Basically, it was a huge misunderstanding.

Ethan called me a few minutes after I got off the phone with Derek and apologized for getting me in that situation. He told me he had bought a separate costume he was wanting to wear for the party only to be told Derek had already bought 4 Oompa Loompa costumes and couldn't return them. So he figured he'd save the separate costume for Halloween. He said someone came up and asked him about the costumes and he answered honestly, but didn't think his comment would cause anything especially since the end of his comment reiterated he was having a good time. 

Derek, Ethan and his brothers have all come to my defense, and while nobody who was sending me demeaning texts has apologized. They have officially stopped the texts.

Anyways, thanks for the support. As I said in the original post I try to ignore people's negative opinions of me, but 30 people was alot and I was just so overwhelmed that I thought maybe I did do something wrong. Glad to know the whole situation was just a mix up.",UPDATE,2024-05-06,"AITA for dressing up in a ""questionable"" group costume per my friends request? *UPDATE* First I would like to make some clarifications since I didn't mention them in the original post.

2,1clnyq7,AITA for wearing white to a wedding?- UPDATE,"Hi everyone!

So, time for an update. I told my friend about the situation after I posted because I didn’t want her to be angry right after/during her special day. But first let me explain what happened after she spilled soda on my dress. I went to the bride’s sister and explained everything and told her not to tell the bride. The sister and I went to the home of the bride and groom (she has the bride’s key and they live near the reception building) because my luggage was there and I changed. Luckly I had a dress, unfortunately it wasn’t a long gown but a short knee length dress. The bride noticed when I went back, and I lied and told her that the other dress wasn’t comfortable, and we went on with the party.

Then I sat down with the bride. I told her and she became so pissed and told me she never wanted to see those people again. We messaged the girl and the bride told her to pay up for the cleaning and the girl surprisingly paid the full amount. She had thought the bride wanted to stay friends but after she sent the money to the bride via venom my friend blocked her and the others. She apologized and I told her it wasn’t her fault. I’m staying another week here and it feels a lot better with having told her everything. Thank you all for the replies on my other story.",UPDATE,2024-05-06,"AITA for wearing white to a wedding?- UPDATE Hi everyone!

3,1clj4dm,AITA for wanting to choose my own happiness over my mom’s?,"Before I continue this, I just want everyone to know that I am very aware of everything going on in our lives and I don't fault my mom for anything that's been going on.

My mom (50f) and | (23 nonbinary), have been struggling financially for a few years now. Recently, it's been at its worst, to the point where certain utilities are threatened to be turned off, such as gas, water, electricity, etc. My mom has a full time job plus a side business that she's been doing for a few years to bring in extra money. I, also, have a full time job and starting a new side business soon, to help us.

For the past few weeks, my mom has been feeling very depressed about our situation, more so than usual. So much that we would be sitting down, watching tv, and she would randomly say things like ""this is the most depressed i've ever been,"" or ""i have to be one of the most unhappy people in the world right now."" I appreciate her expressing these things to me and I want to know when she's feeling down. But it's gotten to the point where she gets upset with me if i have nothing to say or contribute.

For example, one night, we had nothing to eat for dinner. We both worked at our full time jobs that day (she works her usual 8am-4pm, i worked my usual 3pm-9pm). I don't get home til 10:30pm almost every night, so it's usually too late for me to eat anything, so i don't. But sometimes, she'll text me before i leave and asks me to pick something up. I was honest and told her that i didn't have the money to grab anything for her and that if she wanted it, I had some noodles she could cook up or have something leftovers she had made the previous week. I thought everything was fine until I got home. She was very short with me, only giving me one word answers. I tried to cheer her up by telling her some funny stuff that happened to me at work, and she gave me nothing. I asked her what was wrong and she said ""you came home, not even concerned with what i should have for dinner.""

This happens quite often and it's getting to the point where it's weighing on my mental health. I hate coming home because I know as soon as i step through the door, I'll feel guilty for not being able to do anything to help. No matter what I do, it's never enough. I can't stand being in a place where I'm never happy, just because my mom isn't. When im not home, i'm smiling, laughing, and very social!

Like I said before, I'm very aware of our situation and her reactions are warranted! But i just can't help it, having this feeling of wanting to get away because of all this pressure on me to help make things better for us. I just want to get away for a while, work on my mental well being, and focus on my happiness.

4,1clb3bc,AITA for thinking that my mother is a NARCISSIST/Pathological Liar who shouldn't have another child?,"My (17 Trans Masc) mother (36 Female) is a raging narcissist and keeps talking about having a child with my stepfather (30 Male). I have never been more opposed to an idea in my entire life. 

To make our history concise: We have a horrible relationship. She was an addict and felon who was in and out of prison for a while, and only got me back into her house when I was 14 (after basically abandoning me and pawning me off on the rest of the family starting around age 3 or 4). When she came back into my life, I was thankful to finally have her back to start forming my own opinions of her because everybody else seemed to hate her. 

Now I know why everybody hated her so much. She's an immature, irresponsible, narcissistic, bipolar *SSHOLE who can't be trusted with money and needs a harsh reality check. 

I am adamantly against the idea of her and my stepdad having a child together. She's also genuinely trying to go about it by saying ""OK, if we get my tubes untied, I'll give you a baby but you have to take care of it."" 

My only question for her is: How well did that work with the dog that ended up becoming yours? He's the one in the wrokforce, you have job-stopper tattoos everywhere AND a record. 

We also have money issues right now. FFS, for the THIRD TIME in my life I sleep on grama's couch, and you guys are sleeping in my cousin's room. Dad makes minimum wage. Where is the room for a baby to even begin with?

5,1cl9hys,AITA refusing to accept my aunt’s apology out of pettiness? And for swearing at her?,"I (21f) do film and tv extra work as a side job. 

A while back, I was cast as an extra on a  project set during World War II. Specifically, I was playing a concentration camp prisoner and had to shave my head for the part.

During and after filming, I had to deal with some pretty backhanded comments about my look. I’m already pretty skinny, so I had family and strangers commenting about how I look like a cancer patient. Or a boy.

My uncle’s wife was especially nasty about it. She’s pretty conservative so she was make all these comments about how I look like a lesbian. I broke up with my ex-boyfriend around that time, so that didn’t help. 

My family was really great at shutting down my aunt’s nastiness, but she was still making jabs about my bald head months after filming wrapped.

6,1cl9ed5,AITA for snapping at my mum over a haircut,"I (24F) went out with my mum yesterday to the mall for a haircut - she said she wanted to accompany me because she needed to leave the house for a bit, so I said ok. She's always followed us out to get haircuts since we were teenagers, anyway.

I went to get my hair cut. After we finished, I followed her to shop around for some things for a bit, then we walked home.

On the way back through the mall, she suddenly noticed that the back of my short hair (it's a bob cut) looked uneven. She told me to stop walking and kept touching my hair to check, and even pulled me aside to take photos to show me what the problem was. I looked at the photos and told her that I didn't see anything wrong with it. To me it just looked like a bit of styling done on both sides that resulted it in looking sort of uneven.

She kept telling me that it was uneven and that she had never seen this issue with my hair before, and insisted that I go back to fix it. I didn't want to because there was nothing wrong with it and I didn't see the point in going back to the salon to kick up a fuss over something as trivial as this. She said that it was the hairstylist's fault for not cutting it properly and that they should fix it and we should not have to pay. I was tired and wanted to go home, so I repeated that I was okay with it and that I didn't want to go back to the salon.

She didn't seem to be listening to any of my explanations - she kept saying that it was improper and that I would look like a fool going out in public with uneven hair. I was going to snap at this point. When she asked why I didn't want to listen to her, I lost it. I told her that 'it's my hair, not yours.' She got angry, and then told me to go home by myself. I did. I kept walking and didn't look back.

She came home later at night and she's been silent ever since. I texted her an apology and told her that I was sorry for what I said and for walking away. I explained my stance and how I felt there was no need to go back, since the haircut looked okay to me. She hasn't responded and I think she's still angry.

Was what I said too harsh? Would appreciate some advice as my feelings are all over the place about this and I don't think I can think objectively about this right now.

7,1cl93kb,AITA wife's sister lets her kids run wild and destroy my house during family dinners. So I voiced my opinion. ,"My wife has her siblings over for dinner EVERY week. Two brothers and two sisters. Only one is married with kids. These kids are not parented at all. Many times we have to stop a child from serious injury because their parents just forget they exist. 
Tonight I bought a cake for my wife's birthday that is next week, since I will be leaving town for work and missing the date I wanted to celebrate. The oldest of the little guys (6) starts literally pounding the floor full blown tantrum that I won't let him Carry the cake lit with candles to the table. I ignore and proceed. 
After cutting the cake and bringing my wife her piece, the little brat jumps up and smashes his toy truck down into the middle of it. I get my wife another but she just eats around it and says she doesn't mind. I brush it off. Minutes later the toddler kid #3 is seen running through my great room with a spoon full of icing that his mom Gave him. And another child #2 ,is using an egg roll as a missle smashing it into my walls. 
My wife permits this anarchy, I keep my mouth shut as usual. After the circus leaves our house. I'm cleaning up and doing dishes by myself. My wife walks in and she sighs relief that they are gone. I made the mistake of venting how frustrated I am that her sister, her husband and children have zero respect for our home. The response was a rage filled screaming match about how absolutely Terrible I am and that she will make sure her sisters family is never present when I am home.
 
TLDR wife lets her Neice, nephew destroy our house on a weekly bases and then screams at me when I voice frustration. 

Edit: background my wife usually cooks and cleans up after her family get togethers. This time I chose to take over.  I do my best to assist in prep and cleanup. I get that even though I am home only half the month, I still need to engage in the household duties. I try to make up for my absensce when I'm home. 
Edit 2: Many of you have mentioned that I should let her threat of never having them over when I'm home come true. It's an empty threat meant to make me fearful of her running down my character to her family/ friends. 

Update: 
Sat down with my wife today and established this behavior won't continue. We are in agreement to start with marriage counseling again. She apologized for being mean. I stood my ground that the verbal abuse won't continue. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-06,"AITA wife's sister lets her kids run wild and destroy my house during family dinners. So I voiced my opinion.  My wife has her siblings over for dinner EVERY week. Two brothers and two sisters. Only one is married with kids. These kids are not parented at all. Many times we have to stop a child from serious injury because their parents just forget they exist. 
Tonight I bought a cake for my wife's birthday that is next week, since I will be leaving town for work and missing the date I wanted to celebrate. The oldest of the little guys (6) starts literally pounding the floor full blown tantrum that I won't let him Carry the cake lit with candles to the table. I ignore and proceed. 
After cutting the cake and bringing my wife her piece, the little brat jumps up and smashes his toy truck down into the middle of it. I get my wife another but she just eats around it and says she doesn't mind. I brush it off. Minutes later the toddler kid #3 is seen running through my great room with a spoon full of icing that his mom Gave him. And another child #2 ,is using an egg roll as a missle smashing it into my walls. 
My wife permits this anarchy, I keep my mouth shut as usual. After the circus leaves our house. I'm cleaning up and doing dishes by myself. My wife walks in and she sighs relief that they are gone. I made the mistake of venting how frustrated I am that her sister, her husband and children have zero respect for our home. The response was a rage filled screaming match about how absolutely Terrible I am and that she will make sure her sisters family is never present when I am home.
 
TLDR wife lets her Neice, nephew destroy our house on a weekly bases and then screams at me when I voice frustration. 

Edit: background my wife usually cooks and cleans up after her family get togethers. This time I chose to take over.  I do my best to assist in prep and cleanup. I get that even though I am home only half the month, I still need to engage in the household duties. I try to make up for my absensce when I'm home. 
Edit 2: Many of you have mentioned that I should let her threat of never having them over when I'm home come true. It's an empty threat meant to make me fearful of her running down my character to her family/ friends. 

Update:

AITA for not wanting to run over a duck? 
To give some context, my partner is a devout animal lover.
Me and my partner had just been sitting down having a drink at a bar in the sun in town,
 lots of ducks around as this was by a lake.
There was also a 5kph road next to the said lake and bar, unfortunately a duck was run over right in front of us and was bleeding and looked as if it was dead as it had stopped moving.
This being said my partner jumped into action to see what we could do, at this point I thought there is nothing left to do but my partner started asking other passing cars to run the duck over again to make sure it was dead.
I said this isn’t fair to ask of other people and we started to walk back to the car.
She then said WE need to go back around and run the duck over again, to which I said I’m not comfortable doing that but you can go and do it and come and pick me back up.
Well all hell broke loose and she had what I can only describe as a meltdown, (this is not the first meltdown) she demanded me to get into the car on the count of 5, to which I said I will hop in the car when you calm down, she then proceeded to take of her engagement ring and through it onto the road and drive off.
She went and ran over the duck and came back to where I was but drove past and left me there, 30mins of trying to call with no answer.
 I should also mention that we were out of town at the time and it’s a 2 hour drive home.
After about an hour she eventually came back and picked me up and we drove home, arguing the way home.
I’m really torn here about if I did the right thing by not going to run the duck over again with her, she is saying she can’t trust me now to have her back.

9,1cl8yq0,AITA for someone leaving a DND session and saying I'm the reason?,"So, I'll try to keep this short, but as of a few nights ago, a member of a long term DND game I've been in for over a year left the party without any sort of warning and cited me as the main reason. There wasn't any sort of prior indicators about this. Before this, I though we were on good terms with each other, even if I wasn't nearly as close with him as with the other members (for my fellow DND players, you probably understand the difference between a friend and someone who you just play with but like)

His primary reasons were that I always spoke over him, purposely tried to keep him out of any type of roleplay, and was a cheater, and that he had called me out on this before but no one had ever done anything. He left no specific instances of any of these, and the rest of the party could offer none either. 

We're both very diffirant people, and our personalities clash a bit. He was always more quite and withdrawn at the game, where as I'm a bit of a louder player, and tend to have outbursts in moments where I get invested into whats going on in the campaign. Talking over people was an issue in the past for me, but its one I though I had gotten over, and another member of the party (by their own admission) does it frequently, yet they weren't mentioned at all. Given how quite they are, I think It could have been a problem that I just didn't pick up on. As a group, we generally go into long discussions about strategy and long term roleplay goals, and he often had a problem breaking into these conversations. Thats on us for not trying to include him, we should have tried, but I never tried to exclude him purposely, and it hurts me that he said that, as I was excluded in some of my first DND games.

The cheating thing, and more Importantly the calling me out thing, are completely unfounded. The Gm had no clue what he was talking about when I asked. One player commented that maybe I was doing something unintentional, but I doubt it.

I did try to reach out the next day to him, and admitadly sent a message to him that was half apology, half defense. It was along the lines of ""I'm sorry you felt this way, I should have been better, but your wrong about the cheating thing and the exclusion thing"" 

His response was, almost exactly ""Oh no, you misunderstand I have better things to do on my weekend then argue with children, this message is a waste of my time and dishonest, leave me alone"" 

Admitadly this pissed me off, but I didn't pursue the matter any further 

I have no intentions of trying to speak to him again, and I imagine its the same for him. But, I also worry that perhaps I've slipped into some old habits. Hoping some outside perspectives will help me sort this out, as I want to Improve if this is my fault. I don't want to be a problem at any tables. Admitaly I couldn't fit all the context I wanted within the character limit, so if any has questions I'm happy to answer

My dad has told me countless times that he is “heartbroken” because I have chosen such a small venue because he’s not able to invite all of his friends and family. He has referred to my and fiancé’s wedding as not just our wedding but their wedding as well.

13,1cl8e0i,AITA for moving out of my BF apartment and dumping him a week later?,"AITA 

I broke up with my (ex) boyfriend let’s call him Derick (27 male) about a week ago and this is how things went down. 

(He has a kid) 

About 6 months into our relationship I (22 female) had to move out of my apartment due to some financial issues. I was laid off and couldn’t afford rent as it was hard to find a job as an art teacher for some reason. One day I went over to my Derick’s place and vented about how I had to move back in with my parents. At this point he knew I did not have a good relationship with my father in Particular. Anyways while I’m venting he says “you could move in here.” I did initially tell him I didn’t know if that is a good idea and informed him that it would have to be temporary. Maybe 2-3 months max because I wanted to get my own place to get my dog back. I explained that I have a very large high energy dog that simply could not live in his apartment. He agreed to these terms. Even going as far as to say “even if you wanted to move out in a month you can I won’t make you live here.” 

Previous to this arrangement mentioned I told him due to some trauma I am not very into touch and mostly avoid it. I still would try my best to shelve those feelings of discomfort if he needed me to. He said that was fine. I also told him that I don’t like to talk about certain traumas. He said that is ok “I could talk about it when I felt ready.” I also made it clear that I’m able to “cut people off easily” not in like threatening way. I did explain that I just am able to move on and recover very quickly. And when I told him we were talking about our exes I didn’t just randomly tell him that to make him do anything. Anyways. 

A couple months later I get a call from a friend with a backyard and they offer me a room at their place. So I call up Derick and tell him: “hey I’ll be moving out soon BUT I will call and text and visit often. We can talk when you get home.” (No I did not mean I was moving out that day.) when he got home  He started getting weird and saying “how often is often” and when I said “I’m not sure yet” he says “you can’t just say often” I simply didn’t know yet. At this point I had just gotten a better job opportunity and had no idea what my schedule would be like. I tried reassuring him that I would let him know as soon as I DID get a schedule. Then he started trying to get me to stay by trying to convince me to bring my dog to his apartment. I repeated that I can’t and I told him I would be moving out months ago. He then said “you’re replacing me and my kid with a dog and a backyard” so I ended up leaving that same day as that felt like some kind of weird guilt trip and I wasn’t fucking with that… I told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a bit. But it wasn’t fair of him to say the things he did as I told him repeatedly throughout me living there I would move out eventually. 

He then messages me MULTIPLE times a day about how much I never loved him or his kid. And how I have a low EQ. And I left with only 6 hours notice And I’m shallow for not understanding why he’s upset. I explained I did understand but he didn’t listen. Our argument got more heated over the week and I ended up dumping him. He then said he was going to confront my father because he thinks my father is the reason I was “being disrespectful” I explained I was just pissed at him but he didn’t listen. 

He says he’s mad because he told he wouldn’t slow down in our relationship because he has a kid. Which he did. But again we were only 6 months into our relationship so I didn’t think it was fair to ask him to slow down. I asked him to again before we broke up I told him “I understand you have a kid and I’m not asking you to slow down his life or anything but I want to be in a good head space if you want me to be a mother to him. I need to slow down and fix my mental” but he said “my train can’t slow down so you’re either here or you’re not” which he claims isn’t an ultimatum. 

I began reciving texts like this (this is copy pasted no edits.) 

“You were never clear on your “boundaries” you said you don’t like touch but you came on to me when you were drunk. “ 

“I mean if you're actively wanting and initiating sex while drunk, I don't know, that isn't disinterest honey. I won't question your feelings, but your actions are strange considering. I'm not telling you who you are, I'm telling yOu WHAT YOU DO” 

Personally that sent me over the edge.


“I want you to really understand that that last message only reinforced my certainty that you actually are incredibly shallow.

I’m not sure how I was even supposed to answer that one. The last day we met in person before I dumped him I tried to call him and maybe explain things over one more time. He wouldn’t answer the phone and texted me”I’ll only talk to you face to face. I turned around and drove 3 hours back to his apartment. When I arrived he looked at me as if he was surprised I came and I said “I came all the way back to talk to you I drove 3 hours. So let’s talk. His response was. “it was your choice to come over” 

So I actually dumped him a full week after I moved out. In my previous post people thought I dumped him the day I moved and that’s simply not the case. I tried to communicate my feelings for a week. And he didn’t listen and tried to instead tell me how I was feeling. I told him I wasn’t going to leave him with rent if he needed help I would. I told him I’d still visit as much as I could (probably every day after school) and call him daily. But he said that I either wanted to “be there or not” so I chose to not. 

As far as his kid goes I also kept him in mind before I moved in. He knew me as the lady that  would hang out with dad and him. He called me mom one time I came to visit (before I moved in) I explained I wasn’t mom just someone that liked spending time with dad. Unfortunately the kid wasn’t around for a few months by the time I moved in. So I told Derrick if he found out his kid was moving back in with him I would also leave. Not to avoid the kid but because I didn’t want to start any confusion for the boy when I moved out. If I moved out before he came back I’d still be just the lady that lady to hang out with dad. 
 
He claims I didn’t communicate and I’m flaky and shallow. And afraid of commitment. I believe I communicated everything I said I would do but he acted surprised when I did… exactly what we agreed upon. 


So am I the a/hole? ",TL;DR,2024-05-06,"AITA for moving out of my BF apartment and dumping him a week later? AITA 

I broke up with my (ex) boyfriend let’s call him Derick (27 male) about a week ago and this is how things went down. 

(He has a kid) 

About 6 months into our relationship I (22 female) had to move out of my apartment due to some financial issues. I was laid off and couldn’t afford rent as it was hard to find a job as an art teacher for some reason. One day I went over to my Derick’s place and vented about how I had to move back in with my parents. At this point he knew I did not have a good relationship with my father in Particular. Anyways while I’m venting he says “you could move in here.” I did initially tell him I didn’t know if that is a good idea and informed him that it would have to be temporary. Maybe 2-3 months max because I wanted to get my own place to get my dog back. I explained that I have a very large high energy dog that simply could not live in his apartment. He agreed to these terms. Even going as far as to say “even if you wanted to move out in a month you can I won’t make you live here.” 

Previous to this arrangement mentioned I told him due to some trauma I am not very into touch and mostly avoid it. I still would try my best to shelve those feelings of discomfort if he needed me to. He said that was fine. I also told him that I don’t like to talk about certain traumas. He said that is ok “I could talk about it when I felt ready.” I also made it clear that I’m able to “cut people off easily” not in like threatening way. I did explain that I just am able to move on and recover very quickly. And when I told him we were talking about our exes I didn’t just randomly tell him that to make him do anything. Anyways. 

A couple months later I get a call from a friend with a backyard and they offer me a room at their place. So I call up Derick and tell him: “hey I’ll be moving out soon BUT I will call and text and visit often. We can talk when you get home.” (No I did not mean I was moving out that day.) when he got home  He started getting weird and saying “how often is often” and when I said “I’m not sure yet” he says “you can’t just say often” I simply didn’t know yet. At this point I had just gotten a better job opportunity and had no idea what my schedule would be like. I tried reassuring him that I would let him know as soon as I DID get a schedule. Then he started trying to get me to stay by trying to convince me to bring my dog to his apartment. I repeated that I can’t and I told him I would be moving out months ago. He then said “you’re replacing me and my kid with a dog and a backyard” so I ended up leaving that same day as that felt like some kind of weird guilt trip and I wasn’t fucking with that… I told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a bit. But it wasn’t fair of him to say the things he did as I told him repeatedly throughout me living there I would move out eventually. 

He then messages me MULTIPLE times a day about how much I never loved him or his kid. And how I have a low EQ. And I left with only 6 hours notice And I’m shallow for not understanding why he’s upset. I explained I did understand but he didn’t listen. Our argument got more heated over the week and I ended up dumping him. He then said he was going to confront my father because he thinks my father is the reason I was “being disrespectful” I explained I was just pissed at him but he didn’t listen. 

He says he’s mad because he told he wouldn’t slow down in our relationship because he has a kid. Which he did. But again we were only 6 months into our relationship so I didn’t think it was fair to ask him to slow down. I asked him to again before we broke up I told him “I understand you have a kid and I’m not asking you to slow down his life or anything but I want to be in a good head space if you want me to be a mother to him. I need to slow down and fix my mental” but he said “my train can’t slow down so you’re either here or you’re not” which he claims isn’t an ultimatum. 

I began reciving texts like this (this is copy pasted no edits.) 

“You were never clear on your “boundaries” you said you don’t like touch but you came on to me when you were drunk. “ 

“I mean if you're actively wanting and initiating sex while drunk, I don't know, that isn't disinterest honey. I won't question your feelings, but your actions are strange considering. I'm not telling you who you are, I'm telling yOu WHAT YOU DO” 

Personally that sent me over the edge.


“I want you to really understand that that last message only reinforced my certainty that you actually are incredibly shallow. Possibly slightly more deep than the average kiddie pool, but still just not that deep. I also want you to understand I needed you because I wanted you, and I no longer do. I sent that message this morning after rolling out of someone else's bed” 

I’m not sure how I was even supposed to answer that one. The last day we met in person before I dumped him I tried to call him and maybe explain things over one more time. He wouldn’t answer the phone and texted me”I’ll only talk to you face to face. I turned around and drove 3 hours back to his apartment. When I arrived he looked at me as if he was surprised I came and I said “I came all the way back to talk to you I drove 3 hours. So let’s talk. His response was. “it was your choice to come over” 

So I actually dumped him a full week after I moved out. In my previous post people thought I dumped him the day I moved and that’s simply not the case. I tried to communicate my feelings for a week. And he didn’t listen and tried to instead tell me how I was feeling. I told him I wasn’t going to leave him with rent if he needed help I would.

14,1cl87el,AITA for trying to get my boyfriend to lessen his addictions?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for close to 2 years. During this time, he has been addicted to video games, Dr. Pepper, and vaping. He admits that he's prone to addiction but doesn't think any of those three things are close to counting as such. 

Every day he wakes up, grabs a soda and immediately chugs it like he hasn't had access to anything to drink for weeks. Then he takes his vape off the charger and starts up a game. He usually plays solo, only playing with friends occasionally. He drinks about 6+ sodas a day and if he does less, he gets major headaches. I looked up the vape he has and it on average should last about a month, it lasts him 1 week, if that. 

I've explained how these things worry me (mainly the soda and vaping) and asked if he would be willing to slow down on them a bit. He said yes and we made a plan for him slowly decreasing on the sodas to start out. This worked for a couple months but he got such bad headaches and felt shitty all the time so he stopped trying. 

I asked if he would try to slowly stop vaping since the sodas didn't work. He believes that he likes vaping because of the sucking factor to it, not the nicotine. So I tried to find some alternatives and showed them to him. He said he'd try them but he hasn't done anything yet. He tried sucking on jolly ranchers for the oral fixation. He was convinced that was working but his vape still lasts the same amount of time. So now he's drinking sodas, vaping, and sucking on jolly ranchers all day.

I told him about my grandma who would refuse to drink anything but Coke Zero and it eventually took a toll on her. She had other health issues but the sodas made those health issues sky rocket and she ended up dying. I don't think me telling him that changed or affected him in any way.

He believes because his dad has done the same things his entire life, that he'll be fine doing them too. He'll say his dad is healthy so he'll be that way too. When his dad coughs, it sounds like he's dying. Just looking at his dad I can tell he's probably struggling more than he let's people see. My boyfriend refuses to see that and just makes jokes. He also believes that because he's not overweight, it's not negatively affecting him. He has so many health issues that I think could purely be solved by not drinking as many sodas anymore bit I could be wrong about that.

I'm genuinely worried about his health and I'm scared as to how these addictions will affect him in the future. Some of this makes him sound a bit like an asshole but he's just stubborn and doesn't want to accept how much everything is actually affecting him. I mentioned the gaming but it's really not that bad. He plays a lot but if I or anyone else asks him to get off, he immediately does. I also play with him sometimes.

15,1cl813v,AITAH during car shopping?,"My husband (32M) and I (33F) are currently on the hunt for a new vehicle, we are a single car household because he works from home and I am a housewife - there's zero reason to own 2 cars. I do 98.8% of the driving, even when we leave the house together I drive; his driving time is probably less than 6 hours per year. I contribute financially to the household by buying groceries, covering all expenses for our pets and upkeep on our current car (gas, oil changes, detail, tires, repairs) from my trust fund; he pays the rent and bills for those house and usually pays when we go out to dinner, this has always been the status quo. However we've decided to upgrade our current sedan to a mid sized suv and have been trying to find something that fits both of our tastes, which is difficult to say the least. 

We've already discussed and agreed he will be paying the car payment and insurance on the vehicle we purchase and I will continue to be responsible for the upkeep. He asked me for a list of 10 vehicles I would be interested in, 6 were crossed out with very little discussion; some were rather expensive, some were there to pad the list and act as ""well at least it's not this"" when it came to the one SUV I actually want that I know he's not a fan of. My top choice made the cut and yesterday we spent a few hours looking at and eventually test driving my vehicle of choice, a 2022 Dodge Durango R/T. My husband previously worked as a salesman for a chevy based dealer and is biased against basically anything that isn't a GM product but said he would keep an open mind. His only complaint about it was ""you can hear the outside wind from inside"" and that it's more expensive than the ""equivalent"" GM products on the list. (Equivalent is in quotes because while the GMs on the list are roughly the same size and features, the engines are all 4 and 6 cylinders - it's just not the same)

Here's where I may be the AH - This evening we were discussing our continued search as I had promised to keep an open mind while looking at other vehicles even though we both knew the durango had my heart. The conversation ended with him telling me I was being childish for wanting the durango because I like to go (not exceedingly) fast when it's safe to do so and I enjoy the sound of a tuned exhaust (beyond those two things, the durango is the size I like, has almost all the same features as our current vehicle, I find it attractive and it fits me well comfort wise). I promised him I would be open minded when we go to look at the other options on the list but I don't feel like he really held up his promise to be open minded about my choice.

And for weeks my mother has been sleeping in the living room instead of her own room. Each week she would say that she'll buy the bed bug spray, but something always came up as to why she couldn't. Now, she is back in her room and is claiming that she no longer has bed bugs. She ""starved"" them she says. 

This annoyed me. I wanted to get his bed bug problem taken care of as soon as possible. And now my mother just wants to sweep it under the rug? So I got the spray myself. I got the supplies. I watched the videos. I am committed to spray, however I have to clean this messy hosue first. I decided to start with my mother's room since she was working. I did this all the while knowing she would not be happy. I cleaned out her drawers, I cleaned out her closet, and I  got the stuff off the floor. I put it all in bags and threw it outside. I left important clothing like work clothes, undergarment, pajamas, etc in her room for her convenience.  This took me the entire day, and this is just one room. 

My mom came home from work and was shocked to see the state of her room. It was clean, but it was empty. This is what made her upset. She started reminding me that that she starved the bed bugs, and that she no longer has them. When she saw her empty closet (which was filled with clothes that she rarely wears), she started telling me that the bed bugs were not on hanging clothes. She said that I shouldn't have cleaned her room and took her stuff elsewhere without her. My sisters agreed, telling me that they would be upset too and that it was wrong for me to do it. 

I felt like I had to do this. My family isn't taking this seriously. My moms in denial, and my sisters are pessimistic that we will get this under control.  I figure if I start with my moms room then we would have to do the rest of the house. I already started it and there's no go back. I'm not doing this for us. I'm doing it for others. I do NOT want to give bed bugs to other people. Especially my dad. Only 30% of his heart is functioning and if he were to get beg bugs when we visit him then he would become stressed and have another heart attack. He probably wouldn't survive this one...this is why it's so important to me.

I found them very attractive, so I posted the Pictures with the guys on my close friends story and I wrote ; “ omg they are so cute like I am litteraly fangirling so hard rn!!!“. I then proceeded to post another story saying that I dm'ed one of guys (and maybe I shouldn’t have done that ) knowing damn well that I would not get a reply back. In said dm, I simply said that it was a pleasure meeting them and I hoped to see them again (Nothing too bad in my opinion…). Well Mateo Is on my close friends and saw both stories and got very upset. He replied to my story but then deleted his reply and unfollowed me. I always knew Mateo was very jealous but I thought that was a bit extreme. I tried dm'ing him but didn’t get a reply, so I deleted my message.

The next morning I got a text from Mateo saying that : I should’ve taken him off my close friends and that he didn’t need to see me crushing on other men. I then explained to him that they were celebreties and that it was innocent and that i wasn’t planning on doing anything with those guys. He explained to me that it didnt matter. I asked him to explain to me what bothered him but he refused to explain and told me he wished me the best and that i should enjoy the rest of my trip. Basically he decided to ”end it“ with me over that whole situation.

So, am In the wrong for what I did ?

I get it, rehoming pets should always be a last resort, and I do care about them, but I just dont have it in me to take care of them anymore, and my mom and dad definitely aren't willing. The only thing my mom is willing to do is yell at me when I suggest rehoming them. They're ""her babies"" and rehoming them is ""cruel"". I'd think it's crueler to make them stay in a home with an owner that doesn't want them.

They take up way too much space, and they're just not the kind of pet I want. I ASKED for a dog the year I got my first guinea pig. Obviously I've taken care of them all these years, but I've started to really hate it.

I get it, rehoming pets should always be a last resort, and I do care about them, but I just dont have it in me to take care of them anymore, and my mom and dad definitely aren't willing. The only thing my mom is willing to do is yell at me when I suggest rehoming them. They're ""her babies"" and rehoming them is ""cruel"". I'd think it's crueler to make them stay in a home with an owner that doesn't want them. 

I feel like it makes me a horrible person to feel this way, but I want them to be in a home that loves them and is willing to put in the immense amount of work to care for them.

19,1cl6mlv,AITA Charging rent to my brother after our grandfather passed and left the house to my 2 siblings and mother ,"Long story short 
Grandpa died , left his house to me, my 2 brothers and my mother. 
The split is: mom 45%, brother that reside in home 45% and 10% to other 2 siblings.
My grandpa passed 2 years ago and my brother had been living rent free for the last 14 years with him. 
We have told him that since the house now belongs to 4 people , if he wants to stay , he must pay rent to us which would be 55% of what the normal price would be to rent the home (since he owns 45%). 
He is spitting mad , are we the assholes or is it reasonable?


Context : 
The whole family lived in the house 20 years ago . Me and my younger sibling moved in with my mother and her boyfriend (they purchased a house) . 

My brother stayed and his girlfriend moved in. He had both his kids in that house. It a multi-generational home. 
He didn’t work for 15 of those 20 years. He was a stay at home dad. 
My grandad never charged him anything because he wanted to protect my brothers children and let them have a nice home that my brother never could if afforded otherwise. 
All renovation and everything but the cable was paid for by my grandfather. 
He now has a stable income , both kids are in high school. His girlfriend also works a good job in construction. 
Our goal is to either sell it or have I’m pay rent to the other inheritors. 
The issues is he doesn’t want to pays a fair price for his share , he wants to pay wayyy under market value because he says that he did some rénovation in the last 2 years and had a pool and a deck installed 3 years ago  ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-06,"AITA Charging rent to my brother after our grandfather passed and left the house to my 2 siblings and mother  Long story short

A few days short of the 1-month mark, I told him how I felt about him. He said he felt pressured because my feelings were too intense and that he couldn't deal with my insecurities, but said that we'd remain friends.   


I took him to his word and would send him messages from time to time. He took longer and longer to reply between each one, until one time, I worked up the nerve to ask him if he meant what he said about us being friends. He said he did and he was just busy with work, which I understood, but it still hurt. After that, I told him I noticed he tends to shut people out when he's upset and said that it might help if voiced out his thoughts more, which I realized pretty soon after was insensitive of me so I apologized and said I was coming from a place of care. That's when he just stopped replying entirely and would just view my messages.   


A little over two weeks into no-contact and I could no longer help myself. I messaged him again to share a picture of a dish I recreated from memory. It was a quesadilla he and I had at a restaurant. He just left me on seen. I was hurt so I texted him about how I felt sad and confused as to why it had to be this way. No reply either.   


I realize there are many possible reasons for him not replying and I guess part of me just wants to understand why he feels the need to shut me out like this. I don't understand why it is that he views my stories but doesn't bother replying to my messages when a simple double tap would suffice, or a thumbs up.

21,1cl6gf6,AITA for not wanting to leave the dorm so my roommate can spend time with his girlfriend. ,"Roommate came up to me today asking me today if he can have the room for a couple hours, so he can spend time with his girlfriend. I don't believe there is no problem with this, but he always ask me to leave the room past 8 and up to 11 or 12. I made it clear to him that I'm not okay with this because I like to have the room right before I go to sleep, and I have to wake up on weekdays at 6:30. 

Due to this, I was confused why he was asking me to leave the room at such a late time when I made this fact clear in the past. I guess I stared at him looking confused, so he complained to me that I never leave the room this quarter. In which my defense, I'm super busy due to taking more credits and taking up an internship which he knows, which makes most of my free time and weekend in door studying or sleeping. He kept on ranting that it's common courtesy to leave the room when I have left the room multiple times, so he can spend time with his girlfriend in the past two quarter when asked to. He also brought up that he never gets the room and he leaves so I could the room alone which baffled me because he's the one always leaving the room alone to me because he doesn't like studying near me inside the dorm. 

I know its also his room, but my default its also my room. I feel like he's the one being an asshole coming up with convenient truths to make me feel bad for him.

22,1cl6dzu,AITA for telling my dad that I'm still traumatized from my past to the point where I don't even want to talk to him anymore.,"My childhood was not so great of my mother. My dad was the one who pretty much salvaged my childhood until I was around 12 years old. The company my dad worked at gave him a promotion. That promotion meant more responsibilities in that role. Because of that promotion, he was more stressed out and less motivated to do things like do any father-son time that we used to do. Before, he would spend at every other weekend with the guys (his friends), and the promotion slowly made it to where he spent every weekend with the guys. This bothered me because I looked forward to our father-son time. When I talked to him about that and his response was always, ""I will this weekend, I promise,"" and then I put two and two together and realized he was never going to give me the time of day so I gave up.  
Just one year later, he got another promotion which meant not only less time with him, but he got irate. One of his friend's sons was a bully of mine in grade school. He liked this friend and liked his kid so he got pissed off with me because I made a fuss about it. Then I stood to my bully to which my dad did not like. He got furious that I stood up to him. I could no longer see my dad for what he used to be after that event. Then I turned 18 and left. Through most of my adulthood, he made zero effort in trying to get to know me and try to become a part of my life, because he believed I was ""too old"" for his love so I gave up and moved on.  
Ten years later, he decided he wanted to make an effort out of nowhere. Part of me still wanted to love my dad so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. And sure enough he did make the effort. Not a lot, but enough to assure that I had someone to fall back on if I ever needed anything. I appreciated that, but the problem is that I can't get over what he did to me. His response was to forget about it and move focus on what he have now, and I just can't.  
I went to see him this afternoon as I was invited for a BBQ. I told him at the BBQ that I am still bothered by the past. He did not take that well and told me to focus on he's doing now to make things better instead. I told him I can't help what I feel. There's a huge gap missing and that gap was filled with horrible memories of you. I told him I can't get over the things he did to me. He, of course, told me if I had just one day with his old man I'd see things differently.  
Admittedly, his old man was a monster and there was a reason why I only saw him twice. Regardless, I told him it wasn't a competition on who had it worse as he did horrible things to me and I can't get over that. He told me that he doesn't know what else he can do to make things better and I excused myself.

23,1cl6d03,WIBTA for asking a kid to pay damages for hitting my car,"Yesterday morning a kid ran into my car with their bike and left a mark on it. I noticed the mark and checked our security camera, which is how I know what happened. It looks like there were a couple of grade school kids going by, one of them drove one of the younger ones off the side of the road into our car.

 I also have grade-school kids going to the same school, we live in a small residential area so it wouldn’t be hard to identify the kid who ran into my car by asking my own kids and looking/asking around. My husband and I are considering doing so and then asking them to just pay the cost of fixing the damage. WIBTA for pursuing this?

I have my own kids, I know they’re not always careful and I’m inclined to give some grace for mistakes, and 3. my husband is much more concerned about our car and cars in general than me, I personally don’t even care about a mark or a scratch, so it feels just mean-spirited and arbitrary go after someone for money (my husband feels more strongly).",Asshole,2024-05-06,"WIBTA for asking a kid to pay damages for hitting my car Yesterday morning a kid ran into my car with their bike and left a mark on it.
