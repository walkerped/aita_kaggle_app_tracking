0,1cmcjh2,AITAH for getting mad at my fiance for lending money to his friend?,"AITA for getting mad at my fiance for lending money to his friend? So for preference I am a cis woman, my fiance is a trans man. He worked in the medical field so a lot of his friends are female, he says that he feels more comfortable being friends with females than males. I try to be very understanding about this. So he has this female friend that he met at his previous job, they apparently became very close and she was there for him when he didn’t have much. A few months ago my fiance was working at a hospital. He didn’t get paid much, I made a little bit more money than him. Because of this we would rarely go out. And I would buy our stuff (toiletries, toilet paper, napkins, groceries etc.) because he would always say he didn’t have money for that. I suggested we go half on stuff since we already splitting our bills, I pay my half, he pays his. Once in a while he would offer to help, or buy us takeout. Or we would go to the movie theater and he would buy our tickets I would get the snacks. Well a few months ago he decided he couldn’t stand working at that hospital anymore and quit, he has been doing food delivery in the meantime. Yesterday he mentioned how everything has been going ok for him and how his friend, the one I mentioned before, is going to pay him his money back. He mentioned how back when he was working at the hospital his friend mentioned she was struggling having 5 kids and wanting to go back to school. So he lend her $200 to help her out. I got upset and told him that I was paying for everything that we need even HIS stuff that he needs like shampoo, body wash, toothpaste because I knew he didn’t have any money but he had money to lend to his friend?? This of course led to and argument. He said that I’m just mad because she is a female and I’m just toxic and jealous. But no, I feel upset because this entire time I thought he was struggling, and was buying him all these things so that he doesn’t struggle but here he is lending out money he supposedly doesn’t have.

1,1cm2bsx,AITA - Birthday activity,"I (28M) casually brought up going to a baseball game for my birthday this year. It falls on a Friday so thought it would be fun and easy to get together with some friends to do something we all enjoyed and mix it up from a typical weekend event of going to the same bars, etc. For background we are in a good friend group with a few of us husbands and wives that all enjoy hanging out together.

Before buying the tickets, I confirmed the date and time worked with my friends and let them know a approximate price range. We know eachother well enough that I wouldn’t be buying front row seats by any means, just average tickets. So I went ahead and bought the tickets. I then let my friends know the tickets were $40 per person, which was within the range I gave earlier. One of my friends was thrown off by this and responded saying that since I invited him (and his wife) that I’m obligated to cover the cost of the tickets.

I understand this mindset if it was a more of an advertised birthday party/event or if the cost was higher. But it is something we all enjoy doing and was brought up ahead of time as more of an excuse to hang out and get together. 

What are peoples thoughts on this? It’s not worth the argument with my friend in my opinion, but I’m still not sure why as adults with full time jobs I would be responsible for covering the cost.

2,1cm1z9x,AITA for being rude to my struggling friend?,"My (33F) best/only friend (34F) has been struggling with her mental health (abandonment issues and OCD) for the past 2 months. In this time she has gotten upset with me for reaching out to an old friend (because she thinks I'm replacing her, but she has lots of other friends and I don't have any) and accused me of being a liar because I said “I’ll do anything with you” once, but weeks later she asked me to go to an event with her and I said no, so she threw it back in my face that I said I’ll go anywhere with her so apparently I was lying. 

I’ve been trying to be kind and understanding because she is having an extra hard time. 

Meanwhile I have been pursuing paperwork from an old court case I was a victim in, trying to process trauma and heal PTSD. It’s a big deal and I’ve been working towards facing it for almost 20 years. 

She asks me about how it’s going, so I told her I had an appointment to see the file on friday. Friday rolls around, I text her I’m at the court and anxious, she said she didn’t know I even got an appointment, got upset with me for not telling her about it. I showed her a screenshot of me telling her about it, she said she hated herself for forgetting and that she was sorry. 

I said “I think you should be sorry, but if you are it’s okay” 

Not the nicest way to accept an apology, I know. I wouldn’t have reacted like that if the last few months of our friendship hadn’t been so difficult. 

She’s mad at me for not giving her more grace because I know she’s been having a hard time. I feel like in that specific situation, I just didn’t have any more grace to give.

5,1cm1mhp,AITA for making my friend upset while mock interviewing her?,"I was helping a friend with mock interviews for a new job after a long period of unemployment.

I mentioned that while her responses to my questions were good, she used a lot of passive language and ""we did ..."" instead of ""I did ..."" about projects that SHE led to success.  I advised her to be more confident with owning up to her success.

She explained to me that she actually doesn't feel confident at all, she thinks did a terrible job at her last job. I got confused and asked her if she had lied to me about projects she did well. She told me she didn't lie about any of that. So she's definitely done some good things at her job, right?

I said ""even if you made some mistakes, that doesn't mean the projects you led to sucess are suddenly mistakes, too. Just speak about what you did well on your last job with confidence, you're definitely allowed to do that and deserve that."" 

She said that it makes her feel like she's lying. I tried to convince her otherwise, but she was very stubborn.

At this point I had been helping her for 2 hours with this mock interview on zoom on a week night and was tired + frustrated. I yelled ""Are you trying to get a job or are you making a confession to a priest?""

7,1cm1j0k,AITA for blowing up on my fiancé about one of her interests?,"So I’ve (23m) recently gotten in an argument with my SO. She is very much interested in Genshin Impact and has serious fan girl energy about a certain character and I occasionally see her looking at lewd and suggestive art of this character and others. I personally find this quite odd and a bit disturbing that she fantasizes about fictional characters. I would still find it just as weird if she did the same things with real people and celebrities, but that’s only because I don’t buy into the idea of having an irrational obsession of anyone or anything popular. Anyways, I’ve mentioned to her that this is odd behavior that I am not familiar with nor comfortable with, but would be happy look past it as long as she keeps it to herself.

Recently she told me she bought something cheap for herself for her desk. I was interested in what it was and she said I wouldn’t like it. I pushed her to tell me and she sent me a picture of her favorite male genshin character lying in a bed shirtless and a sexually suggestive manner and face. This was supposed to be a small piece of art she kept on her desk. I, on the other hand, snapped a bit and berated her on how this was not going to be something she could just have laying around our home. She was surprised and upset to say the least as I had never angrily expressed my discomfort with it until now. I only ever made comments like “that stuff is weird” and “what do you find so fascinating about that stuff?” I never had or will have any issue with her looking at that stuff away from me and locked away for just her eyes but with her bringing a photo of that kind of stuff on her desk for me to look at everyday was not something I am willing to accept and live with. 

I understand everyone has their guilty pleasures and mine tends to vary depending what video game I’m playing from time to time while hers is to sink money into genshin impact regularly and fawn over fictional anime men. I’m not trying to change her and I’ve come to accept and love her how she is (hence why I’m marrying her) but we both plan on creating a family together with children and I feel like even just having 1 photo like or similar to what she bought would not be appropriate and eventually stir up questions that our child may not fully understand.

To my knowledge, I'd been paying all of my charges rent and otherwise as evidenced my my zero balance each month up until then.  The charge totalled out to be $250.

After sitting with the property manager at her office I identified two years in which it shows that I did pay the sewer fees they were asking for.  Leaving 150 unpaid according to the property manager/landlord.  I've gone back through my records and found that I had in fact paid them the 50 each year. I also checked the Assessors office in my county and found that the property has been sold shortly after I moved in in 2018.

12,1cm0zk9,WIBTA for not wanting to talk to my parents anymore because i feel unappreciated?,"I (24f) moved across the country with my fiancé and my aunt (41f). I then got pregnant and had our first baby girl. My parents (46f) (49m) came up to visit when she was born for 2 weeks. 2 weeks after they left they informed me they wouldn’t be able to afford to come visit for her first birthday. At first I understood and said that it’s okay. I understand a plane ticket and hotel aren’t cheap.

Well my sister (27f) and her husband live with my parents with their son (3). Neither of them have jobs. So my parents pay for EVERYTHING car payment, truck payment, phone bill, groceries ect everything my parents pay for.

When i moved out at 21 i slept in my vehicle, couch hopped at friends and went without food for a while because i thought “my parents have enough of a financial burden with my sister so i’m not gonna be the same way.” I ended up in the hospital due to stress because i was trying to balance a full time job, online college, not having a place to call home, and not eating properly. I just remember them always saying they never had to worry about me because i’ve got a good head on my shoulders so they didn’t pay attention to me much. Which lead to me never asking for help. 

 When my baby was born at first it seemed my parents were starting to change alittle and would try to be involved more. But when they left it was as if nothing had changed. On the 27th of every month i never got a “happy so and so month” call or text for my daughter. When my mom calls me she only talks about how they bought this and that for my nephew. Or to complain about how they still provide for my adult sister and her family. Not once have they asked me questions about my daughter. When my nephew was born they were all involved every month. Yet i don't even get a text message.

My aunt went to my nephew’s birthday party in April and when she came back she had said my parents paid for his entire party, also my mom was jealous because they were asking my aunt how me and my baby were and not her. My mom would know these things if she asked but she doesn’t. I'm heart broken because they are my parents and I love them dearly but my daughter doesn’t deserve the same treatment i received. I feel like not only have they placed me second in their hearts but also my baby. 

They know more about my ex friends(25f) son than my daughter. They even babysit her son and buy him gifts. Yet I can’t even get a text. I don’t want their money. All i have ever asked for is their love but they seem to only want to be involved with those that take advantage of them.

It started when he divorced my mom, and then continued when he moved to a different state for work leaving me and my brother (13m). After he moved to the different state, his then girlfriend, now wife (40f), moved in with him. His wife has a cat, and I am severely allergic to cats. One time when I went over, the cat gave me pneumonia, and another, asthma. I do not have a history of respiratory problems, it is only with this cat. Later, my anger with him was furthered when I found out that he had been cheating on my mom for a while during their marriage. Basically, I am in a constant state of anger with him over these things. 

So this story started when I got an F in math as my interim grade. my parents were not very happy with me, and we had a call to discuss the plan. Part of the plan was on my dad's weekends to have a call with him and my mom to go over homework because she is more organized.

We have collab all the time so I asked if she wanted to be in another film and she said yes. I sent her the script and set a date for two weeks out, she agreed. The night before she said she'd be an hr late due to a party she was going to with her bf right now in a town 2 hrs away. I said ok, I could film the non-her scenes before she comes. She then texted that she'd be two hrs late.

I said ok, just to come so we can film quick, then go to her place to film the characters room as said in the script. That's when I was blindsided. She went off on me through texts that I can't just invite myself over to her house all the time. I was confused because she had the script and what it said and she always wants to hang at her house. She said the script said her CHARACTERS bedroom, not HER bedroom, so it didn't count and I should've told her. I apologized. She was 5 hours late, 3pm instead of 10am.

She then came to me in front of my other cosplay friends and pulled me aside like I'm a child and hashes out the same convo we had through text. It was honestly humiliating and I just went along with it to get it over with ASAP because I knew my other friends could hear.

When we started to film, she didn't listen to direction and just effed up the script. It felt like she was trying to belittle me or embarrass me in front of the others. Then, an hour into filming, her boyfriend drives up and she gets in his car to talk to him FOR AN HOUR before leaving with him to get something to eat since she hadn't eaten all day. At that point, I just let her go because I was just shocked that the day turned out like this.

My 2 other cosplay buds were down to shoot the day after but she wasn't. She said she had a friend coming over all weekend. I said it'd only be for an hour and she got mad and said that she couldn't abandon her friend as she made a commitment to hang for the weekend. I said fine and texted my other friends that the shoot was off but I had another script that we could do that day and they agreed. We shot the film in record time and I posted it. It was awesome!

I said ok, just to come so we can film quick, then go to her place to film the characters room as said in the script. That's when I was blindsided. She went off on me through texts that I can't just invite myself over to her house all the time. I was confused because she had the script and what it said and she always wants to hang at her house. She said the script said her CHARACTERS bedroom, not HER bedroom, so it didn't count and I should've told her. I apologized. She was 5 hours late, 3pm instead of 10am.

She then came to me in front of my other cosplay friends and pulled me aside like I'm a child and hashes out the same convo we had through text. It was honestly humiliating and I just went along with it to get it over with ASAP because I knew my other friends could hear.

When we started to film, she didn't listen to direction and just effed up the script. It felt like she was trying to belittle me or embarrass me in front of the others. Then, an hour into filming, her boyfriend drives up and she gets in his car to talk to him FOR AN HOUR before leaving with him to get something to eat since she hadn't eaten all day. At that point, I just let her go because I was just shocked that the day turned out like this.

My 2 other cosplay buds were down to shoot the day after but she wasn't. She said she had a friend coming over all weekend. I said it'd only be for an hour and she got mad and said that she couldn't abandon her friend as she made a commitment to hang for the weekend. I said fine and texted my other friends that the shoot was off but I had another script that we could do that day and they agreed. We shot the film in record time and I posted it. It was awesome!

After the weekend she texts me when I want to finish the shoot and I said that I didn't. She asked me why and I said that I just wasn't feeling it anymore and the footage sucked so I was going to scrap it. She accused me of cancelling it just because she was with her friend. She then asked me why I can make a film without her even though I had shown her that script and she wanted to do it. I said that the script wasn't hers, just because I showed it to her first doesn't mean it's her film and I needed content. She got mad and called me an a-hole for acting like I'm entitled to her time whenever I want and that I can't be mad and cancel on her and give away her roles just because she wants to hang out with other people.

Our 6, almost 7 y.o. is beside herself with excitement waiting for her to come home. We haven't told her what is going on yet because she is normally extremely anxious- the baby is still strapped to oxygen & a feeding tube. Our daughter is a constant worrier and obsesses about every single thing. So much so, that it often affects her sleep & school day.

Recently, other friends in the group who have a 3 y.o. FaceTimed with the baby in the NICU. Now the couple is pressing us to do the same with our daughter since they're our neighbors, etc. But I told them I'd rather wait until the baby is actually home to show/introduce them in an attempt to not to worry my daughter.

I know that if she sees her strapped up to those machines, she will freak out. + Selfishly, I cannot take the barrage of questions from her at the moment  and I know it will be hours upon hours of her worrying and asking questions until she gets home.

My husband is pissed. These are his good friends but he doesn't see the big deal. And while I'm excited for her to come home too, our daughter is our top priority, and I feel like I have to put my foot down with this 1.

20,1clzb1e,AITA for telling my dad his behavior is why I prefer talking to my mom about my personal life? ,"So for context I (18F) am visiting my dad abroad for a few months. I lived in this country for a few years when I was a kid but moved with my mom when I was like 12. My mom is like my best friend, we gossip, hang out every day, and even got matching tattoos when I was 16. Im not as close to my dad but would still make an effort to talk to him whenever I can. Overall, he’s a great dad, but as every family does, we have a few issues. 

We’ve had some incidents here and there, but the main problem began when I started hanging out with some old friends of mine from Primary school. At first he was acting fine, but eventually he got the idea that I liked one guy (let’s call him J) in the group, who was my best friend when I was 5, despite the fact that I already have a bf who I love very much, and both my parents know about him.

My bf and I are long distance, so we would call often. Whenever we’d call, my dad would enter the room and very loudly say things like “are you going out with J and your other friends today” or “J’s dad and I have a meeting at the office so he’s coming over”, and things along those lines. 

Since all this was detected by my mic, my bf would start questioning me over who J is and why we’re hanging out so much, and I’m always honest in telling him that J is a childhood friend of mine, and our dads work together but my bf kept telling me he didn’t feel comfortable with me hanging out with a guy (our friend group is 4 girls, 2 guys). As a result, our relationship is kind of strained to the point my bf got very dry and only spoke to argue with me. 

Then one day, my dad brought up something I haven’t told anyone about my bf and I’s arguments lately. When I asked how he knew about that, he said he went through my WhatsApp on my pc while I was out. I got mad and blew up at him, saying it’s a complete invasion of my privacy and he’s acting as if I need to be supervised. He said that he’s my father and my privacy is his privacy too because I’m staying with him. I told him that he’s treating me like I’m still a kid, and his behavior is why I’m more comfortable talking to my mom about my problems than him, to which he just sent me to my room and grounded me. 

I felt really bad for what I said after a while, and texted some people about it. My mom said I was right for getting angry, that I’m 18 now, my business is my own, and my dad should stop treating me like a child. But when I spoke to my friends, they said my dad just acts like that because he cares about me and I should cut him some slack. 

I need an unbiased opinion, so AITA?

Today, in our counseling session I brought up my partner’s alcohol use. In particular, when they have more than two drinks, they become much more easily agitated, and it’s come up multiple times in the years we’ve been together.

In the last month, they’ve had over two drinks in one night on three occasions (which is really rare for them!). Each time has resulted in an otherwise entirely avoidable and pointless conflict. I grew up with an alcoholic parent, so I can definitely be more guarded around alcohol. But it’s a pattern that’s not hard to see.

First, my partner became defensive. Then they were deflecting. Then they were denying. Then they dissociated.
