0,1cmcjh2,AITAH for getting mad at my fiance for lending money to his friend?,"AITA for getting mad at my fiance for lending money to his friend? So for preference I am a cis woman, my fiance is a trans man. He worked in the medical field so a lot of his friends are female, he says that he feels more comfortable being friends with females than males. I try to be very understanding about this. So he has this female friend that he met at his previous job, they apparently became very close and she was there for him when he didn’t have much. A few months ago my fiance was working at a hospital. He didn’t get paid much, I made a little bit more money than him. Because of this we would rarely go out. And I would buy our stuff (toiletries, toilet paper, napkins, groceries etc.) because he would always say he didn’t have money for that. I suggested we go half on stuff since we already splitting our bills, I pay my half, he pays his. Once in a while he would offer to help, or buy us takeout. Or we would go to the movie theater and he would buy our tickets I would get the snacks. Well a few months ago he decided he couldn’t stand working at that hospital anymore and quit, he has been doing food delivery in the meantime. Yesterday he mentioned how everything has been going ok for him and how his friend, the one I mentioned before, is going to pay him his money back. He mentioned how back when he was working at the hospital his friend mentioned she was struggling having 5 kids and wanting to go back to school. So he lend her $200 to help her out. I got upset and told him that I was paying for everything that we need even HIS stuff that he needs like shampoo, body wash, toothpaste because I knew he didn’t have any money but he had money to lend to his friend?? This of course led to and argument. He said that I’m just mad because she is a female and I’m just toxic and jealous. But no, I feel upset because this entire time I thought he was struggling, and was buying him all these things so that he doesn’t struggle but here he is lending out money he supposedly doesn’t have.

1,1cm2bsx,AITA - Birthday activity,"I (28M) casually brought up going to a baseball game for my birthday this year. It falls on a Friday so thought it would be fun and easy to get together with some friends to do something we all enjoyed and mix it up from a typical weekend event of going to the same bars, etc. For background we are in a good friend group with a few of us husbands and wives that all enjoy hanging out together.

Before buying the tickets, I confirmed the date and time worked with my friends and let them know a approximate price range. We know eachother well enough that I wouldn’t be buying front row seats by any means, just average tickets. So I went ahead and bought the tickets. I then let my friends know the tickets were $40 per person, which was within the range I gave earlier. One of my friends was thrown off by this and responded saying that since I invited him (and his wife) that I’m obligated to cover the cost of the tickets.

I understand this mindset if it was a more of an advertised birthday party/event or if the cost was higher. But it is something we all enjoy doing and was brought up ahead of time as more of an excuse to hang out and get together. 

What are peoples thoughts on this? It’s not worth the argument with my friend in my opinion, but I’m still not sure why as adults with full time jobs I would be responsible for covering the cost.

2,1cm1z9x,AITA for being rude to my struggling friend?,"My (33F) best/only friend (34F) has been struggling with her mental health (abandonment issues and OCD) for the past 2 months. In this time she has gotten upset with me for reaching out to an old friend (because she thinks I'm replacing her, but she has lots of other friends and I don't have any) and accused me of being a liar because I said “I’ll do anything with you” once, but weeks later she asked me to go to an event with her and I said no, so she threw it back in my face that I said I’ll go anywhere with her so apparently I was lying. 

I’ve been trying to be kind and understanding because she is having an extra hard time. 

Meanwhile I have been pursuing paperwork from an old court case I was a victim in, trying to process trauma and heal PTSD. It’s a big deal and I’ve been working towards facing it for almost 20 years. 

She asks me about how it’s going, so I told her I had an appointment to see the file on friday. Friday rolls around, I text her I’m at the court and anxious, she said she didn’t know I even got an appointment, got upset with me for not telling her about it. I showed her a screenshot of me telling her about it, she said she hated herself for forgetting and that she was sorry. 

I said “I think you should be sorry, but if you are it’s okay” 

Not the nicest way to accept an apology, I know. I wouldn’t have reacted like that if the last few months of our friendship hadn’t been so difficult. 

She’s mad at me for not giving her more grace because I know she’s been having a hard time. I feel like in that specific situation, I just didn’t have any more grace to give.

5,1cm1mhp,AITA for making my friend upset while mock interviewing her?,"I was helping a friend with mock interviews for a new job after a long period of unemployment.

I mentioned that while her responses to my questions were good, she used a lot of passive language and ""we did ..."" instead of ""I did ..."" about projects that SHE led to success.  I advised her to be more confident with owning up to her success.

She explained to me that she actually doesn't feel confident at all, she thinks did a terrible job at her last job. I got confused and asked her if she had lied to me about projects she did well. She told me she didn't lie about any of that. So she's definitely done some good things at her job, right?

I said ""even if you made some mistakes, that doesn't mean the projects you led to sucess are suddenly mistakes, too. Just speak about what you did well on your last job with confidence, you're definitely allowed to do that and deserve that."" 

She said that it makes her feel like she's lying. I tried to convince her otherwise, but she was very stubborn.

At this point I had been helping her for 2 hours with this mock interview on zoom on a week night and was tired + frustrated. I yelled ""Are you trying to get a job or are you making a confession to a priest?""

7,1cm1j0k,AITA for blowing up on my fiancé about one of her interests?,"So I’ve (23m) recently gotten in an argument with my SO. She is very much interested in Genshin Impact and has serious fan girl energy about a certain character and I occasionally see her looking at lewd and suggestive art of this character and others. I personally find this quite odd and a bit disturbing that she fantasizes about fictional characters. I would still find it just as weird if she did the same things with real people and celebrities, but that’s only because I don’t buy into the idea of having an irrational obsession of anyone or anything popular. Anyways, I’ve mentioned to her that this is odd behavior that I am not familiar with nor comfortable with, but would be happy look past it as long as she keeps it to herself.

Recently she told me she bought something cheap for herself for her desk. I was interested in what it was and she said I wouldn’t like it. I pushed her to tell me and she sent me a picture of her favorite male genshin character lying in a bed shirtless and a sexually suggestive manner and face. This was supposed to be a small piece of art she kept on her desk. I, on the other hand, snapped a bit and berated her on how this was not going to be something she could just have laying around our home. She was surprised and upset to say the least as I had never angrily expressed my discomfort with it until now. I only ever made comments like “that stuff is weird” and “what do you find so fascinating about that stuff?” I never had or will have any issue with her looking at that stuff away from me and locked away for just her eyes but with her bringing a photo of that kind of stuff on her desk for me to look at everyday was not something I am willing to accept and live with. 

I understand everyone has their guilty pleasures and mine tends to vary depending what video game I’m playing from time to time while hers is to sink money into genshin impact regularly and fawn over fictional anime men. I’m not trying to change her and I’ve come to accept and love her how she is (hence why I’m marrying her) but we both plan on creating a family together with children and I feel like even just having 1 photo like or similar to what she bought would not be appropriate and eventually stir up questions that our child may not fully understand.

To my knowledge, I'd been paying all of my charges rent and otherwise as evidenced my my zero balance each month up until then.  The charge totalled out to be $250.

After sitting with the property manager at her office I identified two years in which it shows that I did pay the sewer fees they were asking for.  Leaving 150 unpaid according to the property manager/landlord.  I've gone back through my records and found that I had in fact paid them the 50 each year. I also checked the Assessors office in my county and found that the property has been sold shortly after I moved in in 2018.

12,1cm0zk9,WIBTA for not wanting to talk to my parents anymore because i feel unappreciated?,"I (24f) moved across the country with my fiancé and my aunt (41f). I then got pregnant and had our first baby girl. My parents (46f) (49m) came up to visit when she was born for 2 weeks. 2 weeks after they left they informed me they wouldn’t be able to afford to come visit for her first birthday. At first I understood and said that it’s okay. I understand a plane ticket and hotel aren’t cheap.

Well my sister (27f) and her husband live with my parents with their son (3). Neither of them have jobs. So my parents pay for EVERYTHING car payment, truck payment, phone bill, groceries ect everything my parents pay for.

When i moved out at 21 i slept in my vehicle, couch hopped at friends and went without food for a while because i thought “my parents have enough of a financial burden with my sister so i’m not gonna be the same way.” I ended up in the hospital due to stress because i was trying to balance a full time job, online college, not having a place to call home, and not eating properly. I just remember them always saying they never had to worry about me because i’ve got a good head on my shoulders so they didn’t pay attention to me much. Which lead to me never asking for help. 

 When my baby was born at first it seemed my parents were starting to change alittle and would try to be involved more. But when they left it was as if nothing had changed. On the 27th of every month i never got a “happy so and so month” call or text for my daughter. When my mom calls me she only talks about how they bought this and that for my nephew. Or to complain about how they still provide for my adult sister and her family. Not once have they asked me questions about my daughter. When my nephew was born they were all involved every month. Yet i don't even get a text message.

My aunt went to my nephew’s birthday party in April and when she came back she had said my parents paid for his entire party, also my mom was jealous because they were asking my aunt how me and my baby were and not her. My mom would know these things if she asked but she doesn’t. I'm heart broken because they are my parents and I love them dearly but my daughter doesn’t deserve the same treatment i received. I feel like not only have they placed me second in their hearts but also my baby. 

They know more about my ex friends(25f) son than my daughter. They even babysit her son and buy him gifts. Yet I can’t even get a text. I don’t want their money. All i have ever asked for is their love but they seem to only want to be involved with those that take advantage of them.

It started when he divorced my mom, and then continued when he moved to a different state for work leaving me and my brother (13m). After he moved to the different state, his then girlfriend, now wife (40f), moved in with him. His wife has a cat, and I am severely allergic to cats. One time when I went over, the cat gave me pneumonia, and another, asthma. I do not have a history of respiratory problems, it is only with this cat. Later, my anger with him was furthered when I found out that he had been cheating on my mom for a while during their marriage. Basically, I am in a constant state of anger with him over these things. 

So this story started when I got an F in math as my interim grade. my parents were not very happy with me, and we had a call to discuss the plan. Part of the plan was on my dad's weekends to have a call with him and my mom to go over homework because she is more organized.

We have collab all the time so I asked if she wanted to be in another film and she said yes. I sent her the script and set a date for two weeks out, she agreed. The night before she said she'd be an hr late due to a party she was going to with her bf right now in a town 2 hrs away. I said ok, I could film the non-her scenes before she comes. She then texted that she'd be two hrs late.

I said ok, just to come so we can film quick, then go to her place to film the characters room as said in the script. That's when I was blindsided. She went off on me through texts that I can't just invite myself over to her house all the time. I was confused because she had the script and what it said and she always wants to hang at her house. She said the script said her CHARACTERS bedroom, not HER bedroom, so it didn't count and I should've told her. I apologized. She was 5 hours late, 3pm instead of 10am.

She then came to me in front of my other cosplay friends and pulled me aside like I'm a child and hashes out the same convo we had through text. It was honestly humiliating and I just went along with it to get it over with ASAP because I knew my other friends could hear.

When we started to film, she didn't listen to direction and just effed up the script. It felt like she was trying to belittle me or embarrass me in front of the others. Then, an hour into filming, her boyfriend drives up and she gets in his car to talk to him FOR AN HOUR before leaving with him to get something to eat since she hadn't eaten all day. At that point, I just let her go because I was just shocked that the day turned out like this.

My 2 other cosplay buds were down to shoot the day after but she wasn't. She said she had a friend coming over all weekend. I said it'd only be for an hour and she got mad and said that she couldn't abandon her friend as she made a commitment to hang for the weekend. I said fine and texted my other friends that the shoot was off but I had another script that we could do that day and they agreed. We shot the film in record time and I posted it. It was awesome!

I said ok, just to come so we can film quick, then go to her place to film the characters room as said in the script. That's when I was blindsided. She went off on me through texts that I can't just invite myself over to her house all the time. I was confused because she had the script and what it said and she always wants to hang at her house. She said the script said her CHARACTERS bedroom, not HER bedroom, so it didn't count and I should've told her. I apologized. She was 5 hours late, 3pm instead of 10am.

She then came to me in front of my other cosplay friends and pulled me aside like I'm a child and hashes out the same convo we had through text. It was honestly humiliating and I just went along with it to get it over with ASAP because I knew my other friends could hear.

When we started to film, she didn't listen to direction and just effed up the script. It felt like she was trying to belittle me or embarrass me in front of the others. Then, an hour into filming, her boyfriend drives up and she gets in his car to talk to him FOR AN HOUR before leaving with him to get something to eat since she hadn't eaten all day. At that point, I just let her go because I was just shocked that the day turned out like this.

My 2 other cosplay buds were down to shoot the day after but she wasn't. She said she had a friend coming over all weekend. I said it'd only be for an hour and she got mad and said that she couldn't abandon her friend as she made a commitment to hang for the weekend. I said fine and texted my other friends that the shoot was off but I had another script that we could do that day and they agreed. We shot the film in record time and I posted it. It was awesome!

After the weekend she texts me when I want to finish the shoot and I said that I didn't. She asked me why and I said that I just wasn't feeling it anymore and the footage sucked so I was going to scrap it. She accused me of cancelling it just because she was with her friend. She then asked me why I can make a film without her even though I had shown her that script and she wanted to do it. I said that the script wasn't hers, just because I showed it to her first doesn't mean it's her film and I needed content. She got mad and called me an a-hole for acting like I'm entitled to her time whenever I want and that I can't be mad and cancel on her and give away her roles just because she wants to hang out with other people.

20,1clzb1e,AITA for telling my dad his behavior is why I prefer talking to my mom about my personal life? ,"So for context I (18F) am visiting my dad abroad for a few months. I lived in this country for a few years when I was a kid but moved with my mom when I was like 12. My mom is like my best friend, we gossip, hang out every day, and even got matching tattoos when I was 16. Im not as close to my dad but would still make an effort to talk to him whenever I can. Overall, he’s a great dad, but as every family does, we have a few issues. 

We’ve had some incidents here and there, but the main problem began when I started hanging out with some old friends of mine from Primary school. At first he was acting fine, but eventually he got the idea that I liked one guy (let’s call him J) in the group, who was my best friend when I was 5, despite the fact that I already have a bf who I love very much, and both my parents know about him.

My bf and I are long distance, so we would call often. Whenever we’d call, my dad would enter the room and very loudly say things like “are you going out with J and your other friends today” or “J’s dad and I have a meeting at the office so he’s coming over”, and things along those lines. 

Since all this was detected by my mic, my bf would start questioning me over who J is and why we’re hanging out so much, and I’m always honest in telling him that J is a childhood friend of mine, and our dads work together but my bf kept telling me he didn’t feel comfortable with me hanging out with a guy (our friend group is 4 girls, 2 guys). As a result, our relationship is kind of strained to the point my bf got very dry and only spoke to argue with me. 

Then one day, my dad brought up something I haven’t told anyone about my bf and I’s arguments lately. When I asked how he knew about that, he said he went through my WhatsApp on my pc while I was out. I got mad and blew up at him, saying it’s a complete invasion of my privacy and he’s acting as if I need to be supervised. He said that he’s my father and my privacy is his privacy too because I’m staying with him. I told him that he’s treating me like I’m still a kid, and his behavior is why I’m more comfortable talking to my mom about my problems than him, to which he just sent me to my room and grounded me. 

I felt really bad for what I said after a while, and texted some people about it. My mom said I was right for getting angry, that I’m 18 now, my business is my own, and my dad should stop treating me like a child. But when I spoke to my friends, they said my dad just acts like that because he cares about me and I should cut him some slack.

Hey, this is a longer one, so buckle up and get cozy. I am 13 and I love tech. I take interest in ethical hacking. I can admit I have not always been ethical because last year I tampered with the school computers inside and was able to reset them to not have any restrictions. Honestly, it was pretty dumb. I showed it to friends, etc., and eventually got caught. Not my proudest moment, but what happened happened. I got suspended, came back later, and now I am here.

So, when I came back, I received a laptop and started working again. I was on the school's learning platform and got flagged for cheating. Honestly, I was not cheating. So, I went to a teacher, and they unlocked me because they are aware I love tech and likely had something running because I was on a personal computer at the time.

Hey, this is a longer one, so buckle up and get cozy. I am 13 and I love tech. I take interest in ethical hacking. I can admit I have not always been ethical because last year I tampered with the school computers inside and was able to reset them to not have any restrictions. Honestly, it was pretty dumb. I showed it to friends, etc., and eventually got caught. Not my proudest moment, but what happened happened. I got suspended, came back later, and now I am here.

So, when I came back, I received a laptop and started working again. I was on the school's learning platform and got flagged for cheating. Honestly, I was not cheating. So, I went to a teacher, and they unlocked me because they are aware I love tech and likely had something running because I was on a personal computer at the time.

32,1cmp9sq,AITA for asking a friend to provide the bill?,"Two and a half weeks ago my friend (lets call her Mia), my bf and I went to out to eat Italian. My bf paid for all of us and told Mia to send the cash to me. She took a picture of the bill.

About one week ago, when I was really in need for cash I asked her if she can send me the cash for the Italien food, and the cash for the food I paid for her like over a month ago. (Btw. Mia in both cases she will pay back and I don’t doubt, additionally she owns me a bigger amount of money, which I told her before is not that urgent and she shall give me back when she feels „ready“)
So I asked her via Messenger if she can send me the cash for the Italien food, and the cash for the food and she did not reply nor open. Which is weird because she is my roommate. Next morning, when she was passing me in the flat, she did not interact with me, or lets say weird. When I said good morning (which we usually do) the first time, nothing. I optimistically thought okay maybe she did not hear me and said it a second time later. Mia gave me a very very grumpy, hard to understand good morning and just kept walking. It‘s morning okay, I understand, but it was not that pleasant from a friend, honestly.

However, a bit later she passed my room and I called her, but she ignored. (Saying that Mia wouldn’t hear me is really ridiculous in this case). Later when she came out her room, I approached her asking if she could please give me the cash back. She looked very annoyed and said she doesn’t have cash, only barely to survive and went to the bathroom… 
I think that is not how you approach such a topic with a friend… I am not going to be mad if you tell me you struggle right now and you unfortunately can’t give it back at the moment. Just be open and everything is fine. 

A friend from her town came to visit and in Mias‘ story you can see her going to restaurants, in the fridge I saw her brining foods from restaurants and she was in a different city in a trip or so. It doesn’t mean she herself paid it but it I felt very foolish. 

We did not talk since and I think both of us tried to avoid each other at home. 

Today I asked her via message if she can give me back please all the money by the end of the month. Mia said once she gets her salary she will pay me. 
Additionally, I asked her if she could send me the picture of the bill of the italian restaurant.

Mia went: 
-I don’t have it anymore, I noted down how much I own you
-Why do you need it?
-Do you think I would lie?
-Don’t worry, I will pay you back even the last penny
I just said okay


I think I might be the asshole for asking her that bill, signaling that I don’t trust her? Im not sure. In my country it is very normal to ask for the bill etc it doesn’t note count as rude.

Was it rude from me to ask if she could send me the bill? How would you react? Whats your opinion? 
I appreciate any feedback and thank you for reading 🙏


EDIT: thank you for your replies it helped me a lot. I am a bit anxious about this situation as we live together and its very awkward between us now. I am not a fan of lending money to friends as well, but when eating out it‘s so much easier to one person pay it snd then the others sending it to them. 
I should have managed it better like for example taking a picture of the bill myself. Im 100% she will pay back, Im just hurt by the way she approached it…
 Additionally: 
I’m sure I’m NTA for asking about my money, but im not sure if IATA for asking her to send the picture if the bill, thats my main issue :/

Our renters (30F and 31M) are for the most part great renters with almost no issues.  A few weeks after they moved in I was taking out the trash and noticed our renter had put all of the decor from a party (none of it was actually recyclable) in the recycle instead of the trash. I thought maybe it was a mistake so I dug it all out and moved it to the correct bin.
 Over a couple of years this became a regular occurrence and I often found non recyclable items in the recycling and they often did not breakdown their boxes either. I always just sorted through and corrected it and went on with my day. When I went to take out my recycling out one day, I found an entire LARGE silk floral arrangement in the recycling… I texted the renter and asked her to please move it into the trash.

I printed out a chart (from the county’s website) of what is recyclable and what is not and wrote a note on it asking them to follow the guide and also breakdown their boxes.

When they got home, the male renter sent my boyfriend a text that said “Next time there’s a problem we would appreciate a call or text instead of a note taped to the door and our trash thrown all over the driveway.

The trash was not thrown all over. I had just texted earlier in the week regarding non recyclables in the recycling. My boyfriend says the note was petty.

35,1cmoik2,"AITA for not wanting to give up a stupid Roblox Myth I made when I was younger to people in it, and then getting upset when they forcibly took it from me?","Before this post begins, I must apologize for bad grammar and for this post being all over the place, I'm 15, and struggle with writing, I just don't know where to post this.  
  
Something happened lately that has just make me need to think, and need other peoples options on.  
  
When I was younger, 11 at the time, I had made this stupid and cringe Roblox 'myth' (You couldn't even really call it a [myth](https://mythcommunity.fandom.com/wiki/About_Myths)) for a horror game I really enjoyed. I was childish and honestly thought it could work, and it did gain a small bit of attention from around 800+ random people. Some people even joined the myth, most being older then me at the time. Back then I also wasn't a good person but have been trying to improve, and now am a much better person then I was back then.  
  
Over time the myth had grown toxic and had driven me into depression, as much as I loved the RPs I couldn't do it anymore. So I stopped being involved. The thing slowly died, but yet for some reason, the other people involved with the group wanted to keep it alive, even after it lead to them being stalked and harassed.  
  
Some important things to note before I continue this story, There was a reason I never handed the group that this 'myth' was connected to over to them. It was something that my best friend gave me, they helped me start this whole thing and I wasn't going to give the group to people who had barely tried to even be my friends.  
  
This year they decided because I didn't seem interested in trying to start it up again, they decided not have a serious talk about handing over the group, and why it would be better that way to instead just hack into my account and take the group for their own and then block me. NOT ONLY that but they also got my ex and someone that's been stalking me for years to take my place. I begged for them to realize how bad this was hurting and effecting me but they didn't care, and now are posting about how excited they are and how happy they are that I'm gone.  
  
I don't understand why they would even do this when the group was dead for years now... not only that but whenever they said ""We miss the myth"" and that it made them happy, I just can't find it in me to believe that, especially everything that happened.  
I believe that they don't miss the myth. They miss the idea of it.  
And I never told them they couldn't continue it, I just said they couldn't use my group for it.

I was childish and honestly thought it could work, and it did gain a small bit of attention from around 800+ random people. Some people even joined the myth, most being older then me at the time. Back then I also wasn't a good person but have been trying to improve, and now am a much better person then I was back then.  
  
Over time the myth had grown toxic and had driven me into depression, as much as I loved the RPs I couldn't do it anymore. So I stopped being involved. The thing slowly died, but yet for some reason, the other people involved with the group wanted to keep it alive, even after it lead to them being stalked and harassed.  
  
Some important things to note before I continue this story, There was a reason I never handed the group that this 'myth' was connected to over to them. It was something that my best friend gave me, they helped me start this whole thing and I wasn't going to give the group to people who had barely tried to even be my friends.  
  
This year they decided because I didn't seem interested in trying to start it up again, they decided not have a serious talk about handing over the group, and why it would be better that way to instead just hack into my account and take the group for their own and then block me. NOT ONLY that but they also got my ex and someone that's been stalking me for years to take my place. I begged for them to realize how bad this was hurting and effecting me but they didn't care, and now are posting about how excited they are and how happy they are that I'm gone.  
  
I don't understand why they would even do this when the group was dead for years now... not only that but whenever they said ""We miss the myth"" and that it made them happy, I just can't find it in me to believe that, especially everything that happened.  
I believe that they don't miss the myth. They miss the idea of it.  
And I never told them they couldn't continue it, I just said they couldn't use my group for it.  
  
Am I really a bad person for not wanting to have handed over the group to them? For not wanting them to continue it with my group? ",,0.05246065557003021,0,0

37,1cmnzae,AITA for unintentionally souring neighbor's late-night birthday party?,"\[Context\] I live in a relatively quiet neighborhood. New neighbors (tenant, not homeowner) moved in (right beside my home) in early-2023. New neighbors never made it a point to introduce themselves to us. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance either, as someone in my family was hospitalized at that time. Anyway, while we were busy with hospital matters, the new neighbors regularly held late-night house parties with noisy guests (usually the same guests, judging by their cars and laughter/karaoke voices...). Usually twice a week (for 2 to 6 hours), I was forced to stay up until 4 AM, due to their the loud karaoke music, laughter, footsteps, door slamming, and chair dragging sounds. It was worse on weekends and holidays.

We have spoken to the tenant's other neighbor (a quiet, modest family), and they too were bothered by the excessive noise, and in fact mistakenly believed the tenant's house was being used as an AirBnB ! I can confirm that police were called to the tenant's home once in early-2023, and once more in mid-2023 (possibly more, but I only witnessed two police visits). By late-2023, the late-night parties only happened a few times a month, and their karaoke music got quieter, but the inevitable door slam or chair drag would still keep me up until 3 AM. Throughout 2023, we have communicated our displeasure to them regarding their late-night disturbances (among other issues). After our last communication attempt in late-2023, we noticed things had improved enough, and we decided to just tolerate their (now reduced) disruption or risk irreversible escalation. \[End of context\]

A few days back, the neighbor hosted their usual late-night party. This time though, the karaoke was extra loud (similar to 2023 levels) and stayed loud until 3:30 AM. I couldn't sleep until sunrise due to extreme anxiety and persistent feelings of dread and deja vu. Fast forward to tonight (a weekday night), the tenant had guests visit at 1 AM, when most of the neighborhood was asleep. Suspicious behavior aside, the loud talking and laughter from the guests made my other neighbors' dogs bark repeatedly. I have no doubt that their noise and dog barks woke up other neighbors tonight. I was willing to let this incident slide, but when the guests didn't leave until 3 AM, and the noise only worsened, I felt enough was enough and decided to step outside to confront them.

Crazy heartbeat and anxiety aside, I somehow managed to mutter some sentences to the tenant and guests, without yelling or cussing. I wasn't trying to cause trouble, but I knew I had to say something tonight, as I feared things were slowly reverting to 2023 levels. But then, one of the guests said (non-threateningly) ""It's his birthday today."" My heart sank, I had no idea, but I still apologized to them as I felt bad for being a party-pooper. I realized those guests may have visited as a surprise. They stopped making noise, in any case.

I accomplished the mission, but at what cost? Am I the bad guy here?

For eg. she got VERY upset this one time I was high and forgot to reply to her text about feeling anxious for 2 days. Abby tends to need someone each time she isnt emotionally regulated but that could also just be my perception of her since I am definitely a more independent parson than her.

I have been there for her a lot of times and even skipped my classes to take care of her or leave parties to go to her place which she doesnt see at all because she tells me “you don’t do anything for me”. The last time we fought was when I was going through a breakup and was severely depressed to the point that i had stopped eating even 2 meals a day (everything she was aware of) but she wanted me to make time for her and have her be the center of my attention and take exclusive care of her for 10 days because she had gotten very attached to a guy that played her and then didn’t reciprocate those feelings leaving her broken hearted. Every time I would go to make her feel better she would be making her way to that guy leaving me behind with her roommates who I dont know very well and so I broke before the 10 days were over and couldnt continue.

42,1cmmbte,AITA for siding with my sister for refusing to name her son after her husband? ,"Hi everybody, formatting may be off because I’m on mobile.

So my sister (23F) is pregnant with her first child with her husband, my brother in law (23M). They recently found out they’re having a boy and everyone including me (21F) are very happy. However they’ve had a big fight recently because - my BIL wanted the son to be named after him - I don’t know if they meant literally just his name, if they’re planning to add a Jr, or have it be an inspired nickname, but the point is he wants the boy to be named after him.

My sister blatantly and completely refused to even consider it, and both families have gotten involved - my parents initially thought they should reach a compromise and so did his. 

However they changed opinions when she explained her reasoning - she said that she thinks that after she’s going to carry a boy for nine months and go through all the pain and exhaustion of pregnancy she thinks it’s insulting that he should be honoured by naming a child after him when he didn’t do all the work. She also said she thinks that naming a child after their parents strips them of their identity and makes them seem like property too so she would never do it regardless, so once again the family suggested a compromise maybe a reference to him or a name he liked, etc. 

But she just doubled down  that she would never consider naming a child she laboured for over her husband who “does nothing but gets the snacks” in any respect. Now I agreed with her completely and thought her logic made sense but both parents are very offended by her and say she has no respect for her husband. Her husband tried to talk to me personally and was furious and told me I was enabling her “cold mentality” when I said I supported her.

43,1cmmbg3,"AITA for refusing to stay at my parents, while my husband is abroad?","My parents are very difficult human beings, I love them, but they have a lot of toxic traits.

A year ago we moved to a further city (about 2,5 hour drive), because we couldn’t take the constant nagging and trying to control my husbands and my life.
I love our new city, I made new friends and just enjoy being here. We have a 2 year old, so we go on playdates and just have our schedule.
He also goes to daycare.

My in-laws all live in another country, so my husband visits them once in a while without us and in the summer we go as a family and stay for 2 weeks.

My husband is going to visit his family for about a week. 
My mom called me a few days ago and asked me what my plans where in regards to staying with them for the week. I was taken aback since I did not intend to visit them that week and asked her what she meant. 
She sounded a little upset and said she‘d assumed we would stay with my parents while my husband was gone. 
I told her I didn’t plan on doing that, but that I would think about it.

The other night she called again and asked:
„So when should we come to pick you up on friday?“ (we don’t have a car so we usually take the train when we visit them) I asked her where I was going that I needed a ride to. And the inevitable happened and we got into an argument.
She was accusing me of keeping their grandson from them and being selfish and inconsiderate, since they miss him and want to see him.
I told them they were free to visit anytime, but that I‘m no longer a child and that I can make my own decisions.

My reasons for not wanting to go are a few:
1. I‘m not that close to my parents, we saw them a couple weeks ago for 3 days.
2. My life is here now, I work remotely but my equipment and everything is here.
3. they have a cat my son gets extremely attached to and he‘ll be very sad and cry for days because he misses her.
4. I enjoy having some time to myself.

I told her all of the above and more, but she refused to understand my point of view, so I just told her she shouldn’t bother calling me over this again, let alone show up here and I hung up.
She texted me saying I was acting like a brat and I should be embarrassed of myself.

So AITA?

My mom called me a few days ago and asked me what my plans where in regards to staying with them for the week. I was taken aback since I did not intend to visit them that week and asked her what she meant. 
She sounded a little upset and said she‘d assumed we would stay with my parents while my husband was gone. 
I told her I didn’t plan on doing that, but that I would think about it.

The other night she called again and asked:
„So when should we come to pick you up on friday?“ (we don’t have a car so we usually take the train when we visit them) I asked her where I was going that I needed a ride to. And the inevitable happened and we got into an argument.
She was accusing me of keeping their grandson from them and being selfish and inconsiderate, since they miss him and want to see him.
I told them they were free to visit anytime, but that I‘m no longer a child and that I can make my own decisions.

My reasons for not wanting to go are a few:
1. I‘m not that close to my parents, we saw them a couple weeks ago for 3 days.
2. My life is here now, I work remotely but my equipment and everything is here.
3. they have a cat my son gets extremely attached to and he‘ll be very sad and cry for days because he misses her.
4. I enjoy having some time to myself.

I told her all of the above and more, but she refused to understand my point of view, so I just told her she shouldn’t bother calling me over this again, let alone show up here and I hung up.
She texted me saying I was acting like a brat and I should be embarrassed of myself.

So AITA?

45,1cmljbs,WIBTAH for not wanting to take care of my parents’ dog? (I live alone).,"
A few years ago my parents got a terrier which mum treats as her “baby” and mum is number #1 in the “pack”.
Because both my parents work full time, mum drives the dog to my grandparents every morning.
However, my grandpa has gotten dementia (sadly untreated because he isn’t aware and he gets upset if the topic is brought up), so he forgets if he has taken the dog for a walk and if the dog has been fed. Which has led to him giving the dog unhealthy things such as butter, sausages in the dog food although we’ve been explaining that he can’t do that (which he forgets).
(The dog has food at all times but ofc human food is *much more* interesting. The dog eats a little at a time like a cat.)
Mum has said a few times that she wants the dog to be in my flat to learn to get used to other people living in the same building. This doesn’t work because the dog is very suspicious at every single sound and if she sees people walking past the house (growling/barking) and there is no way to control the dog when she has started barking. The dog barks until she feels finished.
I’m scared that the dog will bother my neighbours (as I have to make sure they’re not bothered, this is a rule by my landlord/flat company) and I definitely don’t want to get in trouble with my landlord because of the dog.
I didn’t sign up to take care of the dog as I have lived by myself for years now (edit: I work part time and earn my own money). The dog has separation anxiety when she is away from mum (having a favourite human is apparently a trait in this dog breed), it doesn’t matter that I’m literally next to the dog because I’m not mum, so I can’t calm down the dog. (The dog has been left home alone for an hour or so and is not crated during that time.) WIBTAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-07,"WIBTAH for not wanting to take care of my parents’ dog? (I live alone).

46,1cmli08,AITA for not wanting to follow the plan my parents want me to for my future,"Hi, I’ve never posted nor used Reddit, so this will probably be the only time I’ll post something. I’ve omitted some nitty gritty things to keep things short so feel free to ask for some clarification on things.

I, 18F, am planning to attend college this year. My parents were slightly upset at this decision as I’ve told them I’d join the military. To be honest, I’ve never wanted to, always wanted to have the “college experience” and all, and frankly I’m just not fit for the military (under 100 lbs., never worked out a day in my life, easily cave under pressure, and have a lot of sensory problems). To be fair, I applied to college very last minute, so I can see why they were upset about this. 

My dad is currently active duty, and plans to give me half the GI Bill to pay for my tuition and housing. Now I should say I do not have a job and don’t have a license or car yet, so I was hoping on renting an apartment I found which was a 14 min. walk from campus, came fully furnished with utilities included too. 

I also have a boyfriend, 18, and was hoping to room with him to save us both some money; I’d pay for the first two years of rent with the bill and we’ll finish out the last two as by then I’ll have a job and he’s currently working. My parents weren’t happy with this idea, saying that they A) didn’t want us to move in together, B) weren’t running a charity for some boy and C) the plan wasn’t well thought out. It ultimately resulted in them saying I had two options: rent the apartment and LOSE the GI Bill entirely, or continue living with them for $1,000 and keep the bill.

My parents are still insistent on me joining the military, but I’ve already tried to explain to them multiple times that I don’t want to enlist for the reasons I’ve mentioned earlier and also it’s just not what I’m interested in. 

Had my parents been more understanding and all, I could definitely hear them out, and with the way I’m describing things it seems like these interactions are somewhat okay. But ever since I’ve committed to this college, they’ve done nothing but claim how disappointed and ashamed they are, especially my mom. 

My mom has made me cry over these interactions more than three times in the past two weeks alone, has yelled at me once for “crying like a little bitch”, and has more than once called me stupid over this conflict. I’ve never raised my voice at my parents, maybe once but to be able to put in some of my two cents (only to be interrupted and misinterpreted further). I’ve constantly heard “Well we’re stressed out over YOUR future”, “We wish you joined the military”, but what about what I want to do? Isn’t my future in my hands? If it ends up being hard for me then it’ll be hard for me, and it’s up to me to figure out ways around it too! They’re still upset at my decision and I honestly don’t know if I’m the bad guy for wanting to do my own thing.

Let him see the reality of things, what happens when you don’t wanna help yourself or take responsibility for your life. Again I know him, after two days he’d probably come crawling back, hopefully determined to change his life.

54,1cmkft1,WIBTA for taking my friends to court ,"So backtracking, I, 22F, took two of my college friends back to my hometown over the holidays about 2 years ago now. Growing up close to a major metro area, I thought it would be a fun little trip to close out the year, offering to drive and pay for a place to stay. (I have a large family and not enough bedrooms for them to be comfortable). I asked what they’d like to do, and we booked 2 events and planned a day in the city, totaling over $1000, including food and travel. Both said they would pay me back, since I was the one fronting the cost of this trip. I understand we were in college and it is not cheap, but when I tried to ask for repayment, I was met with arguments and straight up refused to accept this was the amount we spent. After weeks of fighting, I had only received a $20 venmo and now they’ve ghosted me. It has been almost 2 years of no contact from them, leaving me to pay the balance plus the interest building on my credit card. Did I mention that that is my only credit card and I opened it just to make this trip happen? With an interest rate around 16% and a period of 2 years, that has to add an additional 500-700. Dont quote my math but totals out to like $2000 with interest. Icing on the cake, this being my only form of credit means my score has plummeted 100 points over 2 years. So not only have they ran up a balance that I have been stuck with, they’re wrecking my credit score from the jump. 

Luckily I saved everything (receipts, cc statements, screenshots, ect.) and i’m ready to take legal action. I don’t see any other way that I can pay this off alone. As I said earlier, they haven’t contacted me since this trip. I have my counties small claims court paperwork filled out with all their information. At this point, I’m  over stressing about my only credit card. Do I send it and let the legal system handle it or would I be an asshole?

Now to note, I’m pretty irregular with my periods but I feel like my mom only uses mine when she’s on hers and when she’s done with them she’ll use her pads. So I went out and bought two boxes, I put one of the boxes in the bathroom and one in my bedroom. 

Today, I went back into the bathroom to swap out my pad and the box was empty, again. I confronted my mom and asked why my box was empty and she said that she took some to work and used some. I told her to stop using my pads when she has her own and she said “we share them.” Even though she has her own!

So I went into my room and took a pad from the box I had put in there. Well my mom noticed and lost it. Saying I shouldn’t be keeping pads In my room and that it was gross.

We are still teens, however, she has helped me through a few tough spots and I always continue to do the same. She is the youngest of all her family (including cousins and all) but the rest of her family is around 35+ years of age.

Recently, my bestfriend has been going through quite a depressive spot and has lost a family member recently. She also has a couple family members suffering with bad illness. I, obviously as her bestfriend, have been trying my best to comfort and support her in every way that I can. I have dealt with deep depressions like this before and have gone through the same type of troubles resulting from that. I though, have never lost a family member (other than my great nan who i lost a while back) so I am a bit unsure of what to do there.

Now this is where I'm a bit lost. I have always told her and made it very clear I am here for her when she needs me or just wants to hear my voice or see my face. I know she struggles with body image and so I always make sure to compliment her whether she believes it or not. 

However, more recently, when I compliment her and tell her I love her or whatever, she replies with ""Yeah. Okay."" or something similar is if I'm not being serious. I have spoke to her about this and about why she replies like that. She said ""Idk bc i dont believe u"" I didn't know how to react to be honest so I just left it there before anything escalated. She's also been distancing herself again and being honestly quite rude and dismissive to me.

I'm aware these are all things that link to her depression and anger and things alike. I'm just quite frustrated with her and have made that clear. Am I wrong for that? I'm her bestfriend, I'm meant to be there and I am. But I just don't think it's fair for her to take it all out on me.

I want her to get help and I want to get her help but I dont want her to lose my trust. She said once the relative that has passed, passed that she would speak to her parents or a trusted adult. She hasnt done it yet and it's been almost 2 months. I don't know what to do, I'm angry yet worried and concerned. All this is only playing my mind and my mental health even more.

My parents pulled her out of the all girls school and into a public school when she entered 8th grade, and she was not bullied there or in high school. Despite her positive experience in public schools, she decided to homeschool/“unschool” her kids due to the trauma she had from her elementary and early middle school years.   
  
I’m a public school Social Studies teacher, so I care about their education and will sometimes help my sister in terms of driving the kids for a weekend trip if they want to go to a museum or something. I also have dinner at her house regularly and she has dinner with us. I’m currently pregnant with my 2nd child, we have a 2 year old son and are expecting another boy soon. We plan on sending our kids to public school and my sister has said that’s fine and it’s “not right for her family”.  
  
The issue is her 13 year old son, Colton, is the only one who seems to be at or above grade level for reading, math, and other skills. Colton is the most social, he’s on a Little League team and has told me he wants to understand what the boys on his team talk about. He’s also the only one to be motivated to go out and learn about the world and other cultures.  
  
Recently, Colton has started to learn Japanese as he’s interested in Japanese baseball. Colton already speaks Spanish fairly well, enough that he was able to have full conversations with people when we visited Spain last year.   
  
Yesterday, I was at my sister’s house and Colton was showing me some books in Japanese, that’s when his 15 y/o brother, Roger, came in. Roger will learn about computers and robots and play war games for his unschooling, but that’s about it. Roger started to mock Colton by making squinty eyes when Colton was trying to read parts of the book in Japanese. Colton saw this and started to argue with him, Colton walked away crying, and Roger started to say boys shouldn’t cry. My sister and I went to check on Colton but he asked my sister leave and he wanted to speak with me. Colton said he was getting sick of Roger and that he regularly makes bigoted remarks and my sister won’t correct him because it goes against her parenting/schooling style, saying it would be a “violation of his autonomy”.   
  
Colton is going to public high school next year as he asked for it, he said part of the reason was so he could make more friends and play on the baseball team there, but he also told me that part of it was to get away from Roger.   
  
I went to my sister and told her she should start disciplining Roger, she told me the same thing about autonomy and I said Colton had a right to not be around racists. She started to argue with me and I left her house after the argument. She’s demanding I apologize for “telling her how to parent”.

A bit of background I (M25) recently got into an argument with my younger sister (F18) about her being selfish and inconsiderate. I don't know if I'm wrong in this because on one hand people tell me she doesn't owe me anything and on the other I just feel used. 

For some reference here, I'm always doing stuff for my sister, buying her drinks or food, getting her little gifts if I see something she would like or has expressed she wants or needs. She mainly lives with our mom and I mainly live with our dad as they are separated. Whenever I go to my mom's I religiously stop by our favorite drink place and buy drinks for all 3 of us because all of the shops are nearby my dad's. But if my sister goes and gets drinks or food she doesn't even bother asking if I want anything. For example she went to Baskin Robin's a few days ago and came back to my dad's with 2 cups knowing I was there and love the thing she brought and she handed my dad the second cup. I asked her if she got me one and she said ""no I didn't even think about getting you one"" I felt hurt cause she never thinks about me when she gets food or drinks but I always take her in to consideration. 

I got a bit upset and I called her out this morning because she ordered herself doordash and didn't bother even asking if I wanted anything even just a drink. I called her selfish and inconsiderate for never thinking to ask if I want anything.

65,1cmixkq,AITA for calling off my wedding until my in-laws stop fighting ,"I (22F) and my fiance (26 M) had our wedding date set for October of next year. We announced it 3 months ago at a family barbecue, and everyone seemed excited. We’ve been engaged for a little over a year now, and we wanted to announce the date before we even sent out invitations so everyone could plan for it. 

Our initial plan to pay for the wedding went as followed: we save $500 each month for a year. We are getting married at the small-town family church, so $6,000 is plenty to cover what we need. 

A week after the announcement my parents (brides parents) gave a very generous $2,000 donation to the wedding. My parents and my partners have about the same finances. My parents decided to skip their spring break trip to donate. 

My mother-in-law heard about the donation.  (we thanked my parents publicly but didn’t specify the amount.) She decided at the next family gathering to ask my parents about it, where she learned the amount and how they afforded that. There was some conversation before I walked over, but this is what I heard my MIL say to my fiancé: “Don’t worry, I’ll pay for your next one.” (My MIL hasn’t ever liked me, she says I’m dramatic. She’s probably right tbh.) My fiancé told her firmly to shut up. My parents looked pissed off as well. 

My mom said she didn’t think it was fair that the brides side (of 6 people, small family), donated more than my finances side (20 people). I don’t have any grandparents or aunts and uncles left, so my family is smaller. 

I told them that I love their donation, but my MIL’s side does not need to donate. My MIL responded with a snappy, “I’m not giving up my vacation just because you two are broke.” I got pissed, and told her again that I don’t want any money from her. 

Mid-April, my MIL posts on Facebook about her spontaneous New York 5-day Vacation with other members of my fiancés side of the family. My parents got very offended, thinking that if they had enough for a spontaneous vacay, why don’t they help pay for the wedding. I think they exaggerated the trip out of spite, but I still kinda agree. BUT at the end of the day it’s their money. 

Now it’s May and both sides of the family are posting sassy Facebook posts, messaging inappropriate comments, and some not even talking. I posted on Facebook that we’re putting the wedding off for now. 

I posted “We are no longer planning our wedding for October. We want to be married and supported by loving family members, and we all know we’ve been lacking at that recently. We will replan the wedding at a later date.” I tagged everyone, and now everyone’s mad at me. I tried to stay out of the drama, but seriously- wtf!

66,1cmih8f,AITA for not wanting to get a job?,"I'm an 18 year old male and my mom is forcing me to get a job. I'm genuinely not sure if I'm just being a lazy, conceited asshole, but I really don't want to get a job right now.

For some context, I didn't get the traditional high school experience. I went to a private, all-boys Catholic high school that was extremely challenging, leaving me with hours of work of studying and homework every night. Mind you, I was staunchly against attending, but my mom forced me and enrolled me anyway because of the superior education, which I suppose is reasonable, but I would have appreciated the choice. Because of this, coupled with the fact that I'm naturally introverted, I became pretty alienated from my friend group, which I had formed in public school. I'm also not very interested in the ways most people my age have fun—I don't drink or smoke—and that leaves me with very few options socially. It's not that I have no friends, but it can be hard sometimes, and I don't go out much. Regardless, I worked hard during my four years and have just recently got into a great college, which I'll be attending in the fall.

Now, I've already had two jobs during high school. One summer, I worked as a camp counselor (~40 hours a week for most of the summer), and the other was recently, where I did seasonal work for a store at about 14 hours each weekend. It's not like I've never experienced responsibility before. I'll have a campus job when I matriculate in September. Plus, it's not like my family needs the extra income; we are financially comfortable.

My mom reasons that, because I don't go out much, because I need ""to experience life,"" I need to get a job. I contend that I just want a few months to relax before college, considering high school has been pretty stressful for me. This could be, quite possibly, the last summer in my life where I don't need to be interning, networking, or actually having a job. It seems like college is the perfect place to start anew and ""experience life."" I do all that's expected of me—good grades, no trouble, respectful—and my mom forcing a job onto me just feels like a slap in my face.

This subject has been one of serious contention and has resulted in several fights between me and my mom. But everything I've written could very well be the ramblings of a privileged, lazy kid, which is why I'm defaulting to Reddit. Am I being unreasonable? Should I just suck it up and get a job? AITA?

67,1cmig3n,AITA for being friends with my friends crush?,"My friend (f22) and I (f21) have been friends for about 5 years now. We met in dental school and got close pretty fast because we were working together a lot and seeing each other consistently. Once we finished, we drifted apart because we live kind of far from each other and she doesn’t have a car. However, we got close again once we both started a job at the same dental office a year ago.

I started my job first and began working for the dentist (m31) first. We have the same kind of humor/personality so we became friends quickly and got along pretty well. Once my friend started working there, she too became friends with him and also began to develop feelings.

Eventually she went head first and asked if he was seeing anyone and essentially expressed her interest in him. He said he was seeing someone and therefore wasn’t interested in pursuing anything with her at the time. Except that this dentist is known to be pretty flirty and would seek her out to chat and make little jokes about how great he is. Of course, considering her feelings for him, she would take the bait and flirt back or take it further. She was taking his flirting as mixed signals and would continue to actively pursue him. He continued to tell her he had a girlfriend and would even bring her in sometimes so she knew that he was still seeing someone. Eventually the flirting got too intense and escalated to drunk texting so he said they needed to take a step back from their friendship.

This devastated my friend. She was heartbroken and I guess she was under the impression he planned on leaving his girlfriend for her or that he would eventually give in to her. Obviously, that didn’t happen.

Even though they were no longer friends, I continued to chat and interact with him because again, I had been friends with him before they knew each other. I guess someone else saw me chatting with the dentist and let my friend know for some reason because she eventually texted me saying she thought it was strange that I was continuing to speak with him. I asked her why it was strange and she said because he ""hurt her"" and ""led her on"". I asked if she expected me to cut contact with him considering I literally work for him and can't avoid him unless I quit. She said she was just ""letting me know"". I said okay and that was that but she didn't talk to me for about a week. Eventually she sought me out again and we continued our friendship like normal.

A week later, he followed me to her work area and we all chatted for a while. She seemed happy and normal talking to him so I figured they may be friends again. After a bit, I had to leave and he said he did too so he walked with me out to the parking lot. She saw this and hasn't spoken to me since. I reached out to her but she gave me dry replies and we were still friends on Facebook. A few days later the dentist added me on Facebook with the intention of sending me funny videos and memes related to something we had been talking about. A few days after that, I noticed she deleted me as a friend on Facebook and stopped sharing her location with me.

It's worth noting that I have a boyfriend of 2 years and both the dentist and her are aware of this. I'm not flirty with the dentist myself nor do I give him any inclination that I'm interested in him. So basically they both know I am not interested in him.

68,1cmi2zb,AITA (36 f) for asking my partner (40 f) to start contributing again to household finances?,"My (36F) fiancée (40F) and I have been together since October 2021. She moved into my home from the PNW in October of 2022. She was able to switch her job at the time to a remote position and worked until January of 2023. She stated before she moved in that she would like to take a ""mini-retirement"" for a few months, as she was burned out from being a lab tech manager. During this time, I, foolishly, let her stay here without asking for any rent or utilities. She would sometimes pay for groceries or for various tools for housework but that's about it. During this time, she was taking classes for fun, doing yoga, trying to build new skills. I was becoming resentful— my job, while high paying, was pretty stressful at the time. She got back pain from like June-August 2023 and couldn't work but didn't start work again until I asked her to when my job stopped September 1st (I started a new job in December). I used my savings to pay for expenses until I started work again December. She started contributing in late November.

From the time she moved in (Oct 2022) up until now, she's collectively worked in a full time job for about 5 months. The only time she gave me money consistently for rent/utilities was between Nov '23-Jan '24. Since Feb of this year, she's been adamant about not working in her lab work field here in our current state of residence, as she doesn't want to work in this field anymore, would have to get a state license, and has had bad experiences working as a lab tech here in the past. Lately, she's been doing Rovers to pay off her credit cards (which she's using to pay her personal bills). She will be starting soon as a dog trainer and will be making 15/hour, much less than her salary as a lab tech.

I asked her yesterday to return to doing an 80/20 split of bills (what we did when she had the travel job for 3 months—our salary ratio was 5:1​) now that she will soon have a job again and she said ""I would have to get a 6-figure job to pay you that!"", which I don't feel is reasonable. For her, 20% of mortgage plus monthly utilities equals out to be around 485 dollars/month (mortgage is 2250/month, utilities are about 200/month, I also pay our health insurance). She's also worried about her CC debt. I justified her not paying bills because she would do other things —cook most days, clean the bathrooms, fix things around the house, yardwork. I also do chores—clean dishes, vacuum, pet care, take out trash/recycling, yardwork as well. And since she's been so busy, she's not cooked the past few weeks and I've been taking care of dinner for us.

Am I the asshole? I was patient about her mini-retirement, her switching careers, but now I'm frustrated about the imbalance. She says she’ll get back to me about the 485/month I asked for after she looks closer at her credit card debt.

My (36F) fiancée (40F) and I have been together since October 2021. She moved into my home from the PNW in October of 2022. She was able to switch her job at the time to a remote position and worked until January of 2023. She stated before she moved in that she would like to take a ""mini-retirement"" for a few months, as she was burned out from being a lab tech manager. During this time, I, foolishly, let her stay here without asking for any rent or utilities. She would sometimes pay for groceries or for various tools for housework but that's about it. During this time, she was taking classes for fun, doing yoga, trying to build new skills. I was becoming resentful— my job, while high paying, was pretty stressful at the time. She got back pain from like June-August 2023 and couldn't work but didn't start work again until I asked her to when my job stopped September 1st (I started a new job in December). I used my savings to pay for expenses until I started work again December. She started contributing in late November.

From the time she moved in (Oct 2022) up until now, she's collectively worked in a full time job for about 5 months. The only time she gave me money consistently for rent/utilities was between Nov '23-Jan '24. Since Feb of this year, she's been adamant about not working in her lab work field here in our current state of residence, as she doesn't want to work in this field anymore, would have to get a state license, and has had bad experiences working as a lab tech here in the past. Lately, she's been doing Rovers to pay off her credit cards (which she's using to pay her personal bills). She will be starting soon as a dog trainer and will be making 15/hour, much less than her salary as a lab tech.

Neither me nor my parents have seen my sister since or met her husband. Sadly last week her husband passed away. My sister is obviously devastated and my parents have made arrangements to fly over and spend a couple of weeks at least with her. My parents have a small farm with a considerable amount of animals. I immediately offered to stay and look after their “pets” so they could attend the funeral and comfort my sister. 

 This is where it has been suggested I may be the AH. The dates my parents will be away clash with my partners (30F) birthday. We had been discussing going away for a week somewhere like Spain. As of now nothing had been booked, but from her perspective it was set in stone that we would be going away. 

 My partner thinks I should not have offered to watch the animals or should have told my parents to rearrange the flights to not clash. Or at the very least consulted her first. I have pointed out the flights are already exceptionally expensive and those were the cheapest dates to fly. There is also no other viable option for the animals to be looked after.

 From my perspective we can easily push going to Spain back 1 week since nothing is booked, and while a birthday is important my parents seeing their daughter for the first time in 16 years (and maybe last as they are both 72) is far more important in my eyes.

My friend messages me today saying he is not sure if he wants to keep the cat. We will be splitting up and going our separate ways in three months, and he thinks that his space in his new apartment won’t be enough for the cat. He’s moving into a 1 bedroom and his girlfriend is allergic. 

At first, he told me the lowest he would go for the cat is $450. Which is absurd. He tried to make it seem reasonable by saying it comes with all the stuff he got for him. The stuff he got for him is mostly a bunch of junk; toys the cat never uses, a piss ridden litter box, however, there was a cat tower that he paid $150 ish for. It goes without saying, the only thing I would want is the cat tower, as that is all the cat actually uses.

I told him I would pay $150, and he said the lowest he would go is $200 (lol).

The whole situation feels weird. If it were me, I would offer the cat up for free to one of my friends if I couldn’t take care of him. He told me if I don’t pay $200, he’s just gonna suck it up and live with the cat in the studio.

73,1cmh6ee,WIBTA for asking my sister to rehome her dog during a (maybe?) divorce?,"First time poster sorry for formatting errors/Run-ons! Here's some backstory.

  
I (35F) am married (36m) and live in a large home with my Parents, Sister (32), her two children(8 & 2) and her husband (39) I have a cat two dogs, a young rottie mix and a 8 year old golden. My mother is disabled and I take care of her and my youngest niece during the day, everyone else works and comes home around 4pm.

  
I love my nieces like they are my own. I cannot have children.. So at the start of the year, I decided that I wanted to get a puppy. I looked around breeders, and rescues all around my state, and did a lot of research about raising puppies and whatnot (we rescued our golden older) and I made the mistake of letting my niece in on the process. I really wasn't trying to break her heart. I wanted her to be part of taking care of the puppy, she's old enough to help and learn some responsibility from it.(I thought)

  
She fell in love with a puppy that wasn't possible for her to have. It was already adopted out. So she had a meltdown, it lasted the rest of the evening and her dad prolonged it by finding breeders online to show her. My sister blamed me and my mom for breaking her heart, and having to fix it, accusing me of manipulating the situation to get her to buy me a dog. I was flat-out stunned when she said this to me. This could have been a valuable lesson in not getting everything you want/needing to work towards what you want. But it wasn't. The same day I went to pick up my rescue mutt (the rottie), they picked her up from school to drive three hours away and buy two small chihuahua puppies. They were the last ones and of course.. she couldn't choose, and who would separate them?

  
Needless to say, I was pretty flabbergasted by all this, I now have 3 new small minds to train and pay attention to all at once. They, of course, didn't see it that way.. They got her the dogs, so they expected her to take care of them, but they didn't show her how to do that. So here I am again picking up the slack so that the dogs aren't totally neglected and hopefully training them to be decent doggos.

  
So to recap, I have a cat, 3 puppies under 8 months, a golden who is 8, and my sister's dog who is five, a shepard mix with Border Collie in him. He isn't neutered and he is very aggressive towards strangers and my dog. She is very submissive so generally, I'm able to break it up before it gets to far.  When its broughtup to my sister she gets defensive, turns it into me saying she's a bad mother somehow. I know that he isn't my problem, its that I am bound to my family to take care of them. But rehoming him would make my life so much easier.

  
My mom thinks I would be the asshole for bringing it up to her right now, since her husband has decided to take up her offer on therapy.. I just am tired of waiting on them to get their crap figured out so I can focus on things I want and wasn't forced upon me. I feel like a doormat but AITA really?

I live in the UK, specifically England and while being Gay has become more accepted over the years there is still plenty of Homophobia. This story started when I joined my group of friends in secondary, I’ve always been a lonely kid and being gay didn’t help so starting Yr7 I had a new Best-friend who we can call ‘Arsenal’, now Arsenal was the only person to ever relate with me about liking the same shows, anime’s and games. But she left the school due to a new policy which made the girls skirts longer. Luckily or not so Luckily for me, I knew a girl let’s say called ‘L’, I knew her through my cousin and me and L instantly became the best of friends already knowing Eachother for over 10 years and together we joined a big friendship group. For the first 2 years all the way up to year 9 we had a fair share of new people join the group and leave until one of the original group members called ‘B’ left, she left to be with her new girlfriend ‘S’ and they were immediately smitten. As she left we remained in contact and where I had lost some connection with L over the years, I gained that Contact with B. We told each other everything including me telling her how the other members of the group would call her derogatory terms for lesbians behind her back, ‘Rug Muncher’ etc. A couple months after this we completely stopped talking Online but remained friendly when we saw each-other in school, because I didn’t see her often I became closer with L and the group again and forgot what I had told B. Until about the end of Year 10 for me, Last Thursday from when this was written, B came in contact with the group again to confront them about the stuff I told her they said after she left. The Group told B I made it all up and started recording my conversations to see it if I would lie when they asked if I told her anything. Forgetting what I had said since it had been about a year since I said ‘No, I don’t remember’ and moved on with my day. Now it wasn’t until later that I put the dots together and the next day on Friday where the whole group (of roughly about 7 people) all start ripping into me at the table saying ‘how dare I lie’ and that I ‘ruined’ there friendship with B.

I live in the UK, specifically England and while being Gay has become more accepted over the years there is still plenty of Homophobia. This story started when I joined my group of friends in secondary, I’ve always been a lonely kid and being gay didn’t help so starting Yr7 I had a new Best-friend who we can call ‘Arsenal’, now Arsenal was the only person to ever relate with me about liking the same shows, anime’s and games. But she left the school due to a new policy which made the girls skirts longer. Luckily or not so Luckily for me, I knew a girl let’s say called ‘L’, I knew her through my cousin and me and L instantly became the best of friends already knowing Eachother for over 10 years and together we joined a big friendship group. For the first 2 years all the way up to year 9 we had a fair share of new people join the group and leave until one of the original group members called ‘B’ left, she left to be with her new girlfriend ‘S’ and they were immediately smitten. As she left we remained in contact and where I had lost some connection with L over the years, I gained that Contact with B. We told each other everything including me telling her how the other members of the group would call her derogatory terms for lesbians behind her back, ‘Rug Muncher’ etc. A couple months after this we completely stopped talking Online but remained friendly when we saw each-other in school, because I didn’t see her often I became closer with L and the group again and forgot what I had told B. Until about the end of Year 10 for me, Last Thursday from when this was written, B came in contact with the group again to confront them about the stuff I told her they said after she left. The Group told B I made it all up and started recording my conversations to see it if I would lie when they asked if I told her anything. Forgetting what I had said since it had been about a year since I said ‘No, I don’t remember’ and moved on with my day. Now it wasn’t until later that I put the dots together and the next day on Friday where the whole group (of roughly about 7 people) all start ripping into me at the table saying ‘how dare I lie’ and that I ‘ruined’ there friendship with B. B believes them that they would never say such a thing and now thinks I lied about everything I told her when we talked. Now I am left with no friends, the rest of the school already have there own little groups and a year left of school until I can leave, the only person I can talk to is the internet, so Reddit do you think I’m the Asshole for telling B what the group said Behind her Back and should I have just kept it to myself?",0.0,0.029976602643728256,0,1

We took care of the cat for a couple of years, and the vet confirmed he is happy and healthy.

However, a new housemate moved in just over a year ago, and seems to find fault with a lot.

A few weeks ago, he threw a fit, ranting, raving and swearing hysterically at our landlady on the phone, about the cleanliness of the house and what he thinks she is doing wrong.

A couple of evenings ago, he caught me and said ""(the cat) is in the kitchen, I think he's hungry.""
I said ""he knows to come up to us when he's hungry.""
He said ""do you want to put some food out for him on the landing?""
I said ""no, he always scratches on our door when he wants to come in.""

Today I found out that he told the landlady that I ""don't want to feed the cat.""

77,1cmgcv7,AITA for not wanting to abide my SIL dress code rules for the wedding ? ,"My brother is getting married very soon and his fiance . My brother asked me to be one of his fiance bridal maids and that she’d like it too so I agreed. Her idea of our dress code is that she’ll personally design a dress that seems fitting for each bridal maid (fits according to her) it is not a “dress code” per se because everyone will have different colors and sequence the “code” here is that everything is according to the bride and her perception of her bridal maids.	
	
The idea was interesting, not something I’ve personally seen. My surprise came when she asked us to pay for those dresses and renting wasn’t an option. Like I have to buy  a dress that I might not like and will be stuck with it permanently. Okay I was like I gotta trust her intuition and paid.Fitting day came, to her credit the dress was actually decent. Not what I would go for but still good and doesn’t hurt having it in my wardrobe. The problem was that after wearing it for some minutes for so I started feeling itchy and when I took ot off my chest was full of rash. Apparently Im allergic to the lining fabric of the chest and I didn’t know.	

I called my SIL informing her that and she said we could have the lady change the lining. Unfortunately because the dress is already made we cannot alter it but she could make another dress sane design just change the inner lining and make it a bit loose. Here’s a thing, I know that the lady is not going to create another dress for free, specially that the allergy wasn’t disclosed to her (I myself had no idea) so it’s not her fault. So when my SIL asked for the money for the new dress I told her I can’t buy a new dress again. So I asked if I could withdraw from the bridal maids and wear a dress that I already own to not ruin the plan they have. But she told me she already wrote my name as a bridal maid on the card invitation and can’t change that so I have to be a bridal maid. So I was like then can I wear a dress of my own and be a bridal maid since bridal maids don’t have the same theme the only common thing is that the bride designed the dress upon her perception. I told her she  could choose any dress of my collection. However, she told me that it ruins her plans.	


Here’s a thing. The first dress had a problem that’s not necessarily anyone’s fault but I still paid for it and never asked for a compensation even though I’ll be stuck with it and can’t wear it (I thought of gifting it honestly). I sucked that fact up and didn’t complain but Im not willing to lose even more money. My SIL said Im blaming her with my allergy but Im not all Im saying I’ve already lost money trying to accommodate her plans, the failure is not her fault,but for a fact I lost money. Im trying to compromise with her but she’s so onto the fact that I have to be a bride maid with a dress of her design.

Lynn was friends with my husband and his sister before we started dating. 

Also before we started dating, she was awful to me. She would laugh at me to my face, make comments about me, mess with my schedule, give me random extremely tedious tasks (literally had to clean a three story stair case with a tooth brush). I would ask my coworkers who were friendly with her and they stated she hated me because I was young and pretty and I would just have to suck up to her.

We had previously talked about it a few times about how badly she treated me. 

My husband within the last year or two decided to make a Facebook. Yesterday he posts and tags me and I see that Lynn loved and commented on it. 

I asked him why he even has Lynn added as a friend and he stated because she was a good manager to him and helped him many times. I said that was weird and why would he want to be friends with someone who treated me so badly and didn’t like me. He said she has always helped him out and she was always bitchy to everyone.

80,1cmfldv,AITA for wearing white to my cousins wedding?,"My (25f) cousin ""Dan"" (29m) got married to the love of his life ""Elle"" (28f) last weekend. They both like taking part in our countries traditions which is why the dress code was traditional clothing. If you want to get a feel for what that looks like, google ""Dirndl"". Everyone in my family owns one, however, mine consists of a short ivory dress with dirty pink flowers, pink embelishments and a pink apron (I'll put a link to a simmilar dress at the bottom of the post).

As you can imagine, traditional wear is not cheap, and since money is tight for me at the moment, I knew I would not be able to affort a new dress and I already checked if I could borrow one from someone else. So I texted Dan to ask what I should do. These were my suggestions:

Wear the dress I have (he and Kristen know the dress since I wear it pretty regularly at family functions)

Wear a non traditional dress in a more appropriate color

Use the money I had saved as a wedding present to buy a new dress

Dan said that he talked to Elle and wearing a non traditional dress was not an option, since I would stick out too much, but since my dress is not white allover, its okay if I wear it since Elles dress is gonna be a huge ballgown anyways, so there is just no way my dress would be in competition with it.

The weekend came, I wore the dress, and immediatly, I got dirty looks from Elles family. I just assumed they were not aware that my dress was pre aproved by the bride and groom. Shortly before the ceremony, the MOH took me aside and asked if I had anything else I can change into. I informed her that I talked to Elle beforehand and she said ""I know, but her mum sent her a picture of you and Elle said the dress is a lot more white than she remembered and it's really stressing her out now."" I felt really bad, but the best I could offer was getting my leather jacket from the car. But since the Jacket doesn't match the dresscode, she just asked me to sit in the back and stay in back rows for pictures (which kinda sucked since I'm short, but it's her day, so I didn't wanna argue)

The whole thing was really uncomfortable, and made even more so by Elles family constantly talking shit about me, just loud enough to hear it. I talked to Dan in a quiet moment and he apologized for the whole thing but said that Elle was still really upset and I should give her a few days before trying to talk to her. I don't know what to make of this? I feel terrible for causing her so much stress, but I feel like it isn't really my fault? My family is kinda split about it, with one saying I did everything I could, and the other saying I should have known better and just brought a non traditional dress for this case. What do you think?

81,1cmfii5,AITA for not wanting my sister and her children to move back into our family home?,"I’m gonna try to keep it short, I only wanna focus on the relevant aspects. About a year ago my mother suffered a health crisis and as a result I (28M) moved back in with her in order to take care of her. She still has some independence, but I drive her to and from doctors, go shopping for her, help with cleaning, etc. She can wash herself, walk around the house, etc, but not much more than that. My father died a few years back and up until I moved back in she has been living on her own. 

Very recently my sister (30F) and her husband (30M) have separated on bad terms. Don’t want to go into details, but it’s a fairly hostile situation. My sister has two children 1M and 4M and as a result hasn’t worked in quite some time. Now she is in the process of trying to find a job, but with the children that is difficult. 

Because of this my mother suggested that she should move back in so she could look after the children. I am strongly against this. I feel for my sister, but my mother can’t even really look after herself anymore, let alone provide childcare for two young children. If she moved in her children would definitely become my responsibility (even though they both deny that) and I can’t and don’t want to add that to my plate.

My sister and mother also argued that my she could help with taking care of my mom, but honestly she wouldn’t be much help and it certainly wouldn’t make up for the added burden of having an infant and a small child in the home. The house is big enough in terms of rooms for her to move in without a problem, but the fact that all the care-taking duties would inevitably fall onto me is what’s making me want to put my foot down.

I feel like a complete asshole, but I’ve considered telling my mother that if my sister moves in I will move out. 

  
I'm getting a lot of repeat questions so I've decided to answer them here because I realise my responses will get lost in the comments:

1. Yes I work full-time. I am a pathology resident. I pay for my own expenses and most of my mothers as well. I do not pay rent, because my mother owns the house, but I do pay for electricity, water, heating, groceries, gas, and any out of pocket expenses at the doctors. My mom has a small monthly pension that isn't able to cover her costs anymore due to the increase in medical costs (and inflation isn't exactly helping either.)

2. The reason why I don't think my sister will be able to look after her own kids or help with our mom is because the whole point of her moving in is so that she can get help with childcare and get a job. If she were able to work and provide for her kids on her own she wouldn't need to be moving in, in the first place.

I’m being very frugal until I get out of debt. I recently had something to celebrate in my life, and rarely treat myself, so decided I would splurge on myself. When the check came, she turned to me, in front of them, and said “Do you just want to split it?” It was over $300 and she blindsided me into helping pay for this couple’s meals. Of course, I didn’t want to discuss money in front of them so just handed over my credit card. I then contacted her later to say I felt like I was put in an awkward situation. Her response was that I “should have expected it (who joins a birthday dinner without pitching in?)”, that “they spent a lot of money on your birthday” in Dec., and that I was “being petty for bringing it up.” I expected to pay for myself while she paid for her friends (which she would have done anyway if I wasn’t there). I tried to explain that if she had communicated that she wanted help with the check, I would have declined the invite as I simply didn’t have that much in my budget. So, she Venmo’d me $150, said “money is more important to you” reminded me that “you make more than I do” and made me feel like shit for sharing my feelings.

I’m being very frugal until I get out of debt. I recently had something to celebrate in my life, and rarely treat myself, so decided I would splurge on myself. When the check came, she turned to me, in front of them, and said “Do you just want to split it?” It was over $300 and she blindsided me into helping pay for this couple’s meals. Of course, I didn’t want to discuss money in front of them so just handed over my credit card. I then contacted her later to say I felt like I was put in an awkward situation. Her response was that I “should have expected it (who joins a birthday dinner without pitching in?)”, that “they spent a lot of money on your birthday” in Dec., and that I was “being petty for bringing it up.” I expected to pay for myself while she paid for her friends (which she would have done anyway if I wasn’t there). I tried to explain that if she had communicated that she wanted help with the check, I would have declined the invite as I simply didn’t have that much in my budget. So, she Venmo’d me $150, said “money is more important to you” reminded me that “you make more than I do” and made me feel like shit for sharing my feelings.

83,1cmed1z,AITA for asking our nanny to leave her dog at home?,"My husband and I use a local college girl to look after our two kids (age 5 and 7) whenever we go out at night. When we first hired her, she asked to bring her dog (a black lab) with her, and we said that's fine. She assured us he was very well behaved. She's been pretty flawless in most things. 

Tonight, we went out on date night for dinner, and left her with the kids for about 3 hours. When I came home, however, I noticed she was in my son's bedroom, and the dog was in the living room. To my surprise and horror, it lifted its leg and began peeing on one of the pot plants in the living room. He probably peed for around 10-15 seconds. 

I immediately brought it up with the nanny, and she profusely apologised and offered to pay for any damages. I said that was fine (there were no damages as the pee all went into the pot), but I requested she kindly leave her dog at home. 

She said I was being totally unfair, and asked if I could please let her continue to bring him, and assured me it was out of character. Granted, it is a new pot plant, so maybe he was just unfamiliar? I'm not a dog owner so don't really know. Is it common for dogs to pee when new plants are introduced? Does this indicate he's likely peed elsewhere in the home, or even pooped? How likely is this to be a one off?

84,1cmec75,AITA for telling my wife that she needs to seriously work on her mental and physical toughness,"My wife (32F) and I (34M) went to the gym yesterday morning and at some point my wife (will call her Laura) scratched her finger on something.

Laura has a history of being selectively sensitive to pain and discomfort. She is a strong and capable woman that I love, but if it’s 80 degrees with a breeze, Laura will talk herself into it being too cold to stay outside. The joke between us is she is like the princess and the pea story. These things happen often.

I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say this time the “cut” was less than half a centimeter wide and 2mm across, just surface level, no larger than a paper cut. Later that night she remembered the cut and had what I would describe as a meltdown. She said her finger pain was throbbing, she was feeling nauseous from the pain and said it was becoming too much. 

I offered to clean it with hydrogen peroxide, but she said it would hurt too much. I said it bubbles but doesn’t burn like alcohol and you need to clean it if you cut it on gym equipment because it’s dirty. As soon as I put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide on it she collapsed to her knees and said she could not continue. I admit I got a little upset at the theatrics. But it was nothing new at this point.

Then after I rinsed the wound in the sink (she is still on her knees crying), I told her I was going to get neosporin and a bandaid to which she begged me not to add neosporin because it would hurt. I explained to Laura that neosporin actually would cause no pain and even add potential relief. She yelled when I put it on and nearly fainted. 

At this point I was a little upset and potentially the asshole. I tried to explain to Laura that her body was very resilient and she is a tough person because I’ve seen it in our workouts and the way she can work through brutal work challenges and environments. However, she needs to work on her psychological hang up on discomfort like this. 

We want to have kids in next 2 years and in all honesty I don’t think she can handle childbirth right now. I said it’s something we can work on together, but to start, she needs to get serious and adopt the mentality that her body can handle a lot! I told her it’s upsetting that she seems to just give up and surrender to any pain like she has no will to shake it off. “What example would we be setting for our child?” “What would happen if you were injured and needed to get help without me?”

We ended up getting into an argument about this, I feel like an asshole, but I don’t know how I could have approached this differently.

EDIT/CONTEXT:  

First, I would like to thank everyone for sharing their thoughts and suggestions.

Second, I would like to clarify that I am one of those lucky few that married someone they consider their soul mate. Despite my comments coming across as callous and patronizing, I love and care for my wife tremendously and I don’t believe she sees it that way. However, I’m here for that outside perspective. I’ll be with my wife until I’m dead or she finds someone better! (Even if that means carrying her around for the next 80 years)

Lastly, while we have visited doctors in the past, WE may not have placed enough value on getting another opinion. That is something I will bring up with my wife again. I do not typically hold an opinion when it comes to my wife’s medical care. I believe I may have an old fashioned approach to doctors as I have had some bad experiences with misdiagnosis and over prescribed treatments. My attitude when it comes to my wife has always been to get the care that she thinks she needs as I cannot make that decision for her. We both acknowledge there are differences in the way we pursue medical care. I have never suggested her symptoms or desire to meet with a doctor were 
not legitimate. When she had not gotten to a diagnosis from doctors and they suggested treating it like it was nervousness or anxiety we both kind of considered it psychological, a pain in the ass, but not overly serious and something we could work on. As my post here would suggest, that is easier said than done. It’s a huge grey area trying to figure out if you are being too controlling or if you are enabling.

We told our families that we are not ready to get married yet. They keep insisting that we've been together long enough and I've gotten tired of it. It's mainly my mom and my dad doing this but sometimes my brothers may slip up and ask about it too.

They live closer to us so we here it more from them. A couple of weeks ago my mom mentioned our wedding and I told my parents that if they keep insisting that we get married she wouldn't be allowed to attend our wedding in the future.

My parents has stopped for a while but they were a little cold towards us whenever they visited. I was fine with this, but this upset my boyfriend because he thought that they hated him.

 He wanted me to tell them that we were just joking so they could ""love him"" again but when I refused he got upset with me and accused me of ruining his relationship with my parents. So I reluctantly told them I was joking and they literally did a 180 on their behavior.

He then had the audacity to get upset with me this morning because he told me that he wants them to stop and I told him NO. I told him that they don't listen to anything but threats and I'm not threatening to uninvite them from our wedding again. Now he's mad at me because I told him to deal with it himself. 

Personally I don't care that they keep asking I just find it annoying. Was I wrong for telling him to deal with it himself?

He's an amazing guy and I cannot imagine my life without him. In January we found a pretty little house close to his parents for sale and started the paperwork at the bank. 
Now, to be fair, up to that point I have been living with my brother close to our parents (my father and stepmother). My BF and I could meet only on weekends, mainly Saturday afternoons and Sunday because of our work schedule but we made it work for a while but decided that it may be a better option for us to move in together. My parents don't have jobs, they are not retired either. My father quit his job in 2020 because of covid and being afraid of caching the disease and never even tried looking for a job since. My stepmother has some sort of disability income wich is not much (we live in eastern Europe). My brother and myself work in the same factory, different shifts.  And since 2020 we've been giving our parents almost half of our paychecks so they could get by. Ever since I met my BF he has been helping them as well. He's a car mechanic and overall a very good handyman. He can fix anything. Every time my stepmother's car broke down he fixed it and never took any money from them. If something needed to be changed I payed for it. He fixed their bathroom as well, TV, Internet, mobile phones, light in the kitchen etc.

There he tells me that his family is having a big get together for a mother’s day lunch. They all agree to cook and go around passing gifts for the moms. It’s apparently a family tradition that they’re finally bringing back after stopping during the pandemic. 

I told him the tradition sounds nice and that he should go, but I don’t think I want to. We’ve been having outings every weekend for the last month when all I’ve wanted to do was relax at least one day. Last weekend was my birthday, and I wanted to do nothing but stay home, but I was dragged out by my family and his wanting to “celebrate” (which ended in me paying for my own $60 birthday meal). If I had to end up going out this Sunday, I was looking forward to just buying breakfast/dinner for everyone and maybe going out to the beach to relax, not help cook a meal for 20+people. 

I’m not close to my family (at all) and rarely see them, while my boyfriend is the opposite. Naturally, he got pretty upset I didn’t want to go, so I told him I’d think about it.

I have also been studying online from youtube (For Free may I add) but anytime I opened up my parents laptop ( I'm not allowed to have any personal devices, this is my moms phone) the respons I got was ""You can't study from these devices study with a book"" yet as soon as my cousin mentions how there are great teachers available online my father switches up and says ""You should tell her some good teachers online"". 

My father also seems to get a kick out of humiliating me in public as whenever I am in front of anyone teh only things that come out of his mouth are ""She will prob fail."" (Event hough I'm a straight A student) or ""I don't know how she evr got this disrespectful"". It doesn't matter who is in front it could be my younger siblings or my grandfather. Also anytime someone compliments me he always turns the situation around to somehow either compliment my cousins or my sister(his sisters daughters) or turn it into an insult for me. 

He even told me once That"" If oneday someone curses your parents please don't ever blame them because clearly we made a mistake in raising you. Especially your mother(I hv a deeper bond with her) "" and ""If she doesn't even have a heart how can she feel emotions towards anyone letalone her mother(she was sick I stepped out for a moment)"" and ""Learn to be a human first"".

My father AND mother seem to really like my sister more than me (not that I blame) and frustratingly so. We sleep on the same bed and I am never allowed to sleep in between (childish ik but we poor) and recently I hv been demoted to the other single bed. They all stay up all night having fun family time while I am never included and If I want to sleep and say ""Please be quiet"" I am vilified. They say thind like ""Don't do this or she will scold you"" or something like that. 

One time when my sis was 11 she got angry and started smashing things and got no repercussions and i held eye contact during a scolding and was severly punished. When my sis was 7 she stole money from my moms purse and got away scot free and at the same age i took a pair of tweezers from a medical box due to curiosity and got told by my mom ""Your even worse than a theif dtealing from your own home"". There have been many such instances.

Another incident I want to mention is when we were at the mall for shopping for one of my cousins he spent over 5k over them and when my 6yr old sister asked for something he scolded her harshly and told her that ""Were here for M not you"" .

Also anytime someone compliments me he always turns the situation around to somehow either compliment my cousins or my sister(his sisters daughters) or turn it into an insult for me. 

He even told me once That"" If oneday someone curses your parents please don't ever blame them because clearly we made a mistake in raising you. Especially your mother(I hv a deeper bond with her) "" and ""If she doesn't even have a heart how can she feel emotions towards anyone letalone her mother(she was sick I stepped out for a moment)"" and ""Learn to be a human first"".

My father AND mother seem to really like my sister more than me (not that I blame) and frustratingly so. We sleep on the same bed and I am never allowed to sleep in between (childish ik but we poor) and recently I hv been demoted to the other single bed. They all stay up all night having fun family time while I am never included and If I want to sleep and say ""Please be quiet"" I am vilified. They say thind like ""Don't do this or she will scold you"" or something like that. 

One time when my sis was 11 she got angry and started smashing things and got no repercussions and i held eye contact during a scolding and was severly punished. When my sis was 7 she stole money from my moms purse and got away scot free and at the same age i took a pair of tweezers from a medical box due to curiosity and got told by my mom ""Your even worse than a theif dtealing from your own home"". There have been many such instances.

Another incident I want to mention is when we were at the mall for shopping for one of my cousins he spent over 5k over them and when my 6yr old sister asked for something he scolded her harshly and told her that ""Were here for M not you"" . 

Honestly with the tuition remark I blew up and started shouting and now my father refuses to acknowledge my existence. Maybe I overreacted. AITA?",1.0,0.026545867323875427,0,0
90,1cmd57s,AITA for not visiting my mom as much as i should,"Excuse my English, it wasn't my first language.

 My parents divorced a few years back and I've been living back and forth with them. Anyway, I currently live with my dad while my brother lives with my mom. My brother(27y) is an alcoholic, smoker, and vapes too. My parents previously tried to put him in rehab but it failed for him I guess. Anyway, whenever I visit my mother, things are hectic in that household. My brother (from what I've seen when I visited) usually makes up an excuse for example: he once made up a story and said he went to help his friend set up his graduation party when really, he went drinking. This made my mother really stressed (she has high blood pressure too). Then when he came back the arguments were terrible. Plus this isn't the first time something like this has happened. It all starts when my brother makes an 'excuse', goes out drinking, argues with my mom, then all of a sudden she forgives him AND HE DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN.

 I don't like going there, cause the arguments are really bad and when my brother goes out drinking, she gets really moody and releases all her anger on me. Also, I'm a student who constantly needs to read and attend online classes but how can I even focus with all of that going on?? I've previously tried talking to my mother about it but she doesn't seem to understand how this is affecting me too. She says her son is 'sick' and she as a parent needs to take care of him. She says I intentionally don't wanna visit her cause I 'hate' her and my dad manipulated me into hating her. I'm trying my best to also understand her situation but honestly, it's getting overwhelming. My mother also seems to encourage this behavior of my brother indirectly: Sometimes when my brother is away from alcohol for a long time he claims he's going to 'die' without it (idk if this is part of addiction) and after begging my mother, she sometimes buys him alcohol.

91,1cmd57q,AITA if I got annoyed about covering the cost of friend’s flight,"so was buying flights for a holiday together with a group of 5 other friends and for the return it said “3 flights left for £72” or something like that. after those 3 flights were bought the price rose to £91. i got one of the £72 ones

we all bought together but i mentioned the fact that if you wait later (eg a week) then the prices drop, because that’s what ryanair does, they bump up the prices if you buy them at the same time. but people just decided to buy them straight away despite my advice, even though we’re over 3 months away from the holiday…

and i was correct, the prices had dropped to £78 after a week.

a week later i got asked to pay the difference for someone. apparently we all agreed to pay this difference so we’d all be “paying the same” so i was asked to pay 11.50 to someone who payed £91 for theirs. i initially refused and made a huge fuss about this but eventually paid the 11.50 - but only because i was almost bullied into doing it by the whole group.

also it should’ve have been less than 11.50, because the guy who “worked that out” used the global exchange rate from euros to british pounds and not the ryanair exchange rate so i paid more than i needed to.

am i right to have made a fuss about this?

93,1cmcm0y,AITA for conducting an expirament on my psych teacher?,"At the beginning of spring semester, I noticed my psych teacher says the phrase ""do you see what I'm sayin'"" a LOT. I started counting on the second day of classes, and after a few days I planned to present him with my findings at the end of the semester.

We were talking about Freud stuff the first week so with the amount of times he said the word ""motherlover"" I assumed he'd enjoy laughing at himself. 

Well yesterday I presented him with my findings. I'll admit I kind of blindsided him in front of the whole class, first saying I just needed to talk to him but once he agreed changing to saying I had a ""presentation."" The class laughed at my slides a bit bit I didn't realize that the teacher wasn't until the end.

In my data, there was a clear and dramatic drop in early February, and I attempted to explain that as either 1) something happened inside or outside of school that affected his mood negatively, as he seemed to say it more when he was more energetic, or 2) he learned that he didn't like our class.

This was the first instance of him getting defensive, saying he ""gives what he gets back out of a class"" and how ""we're apathetic so he returned that energy."" I agreed with him, and said he basically confirmed my second point (did he not?)

Anyways, I didn't notice and finished my presentation. When I was done, I asked ""any questions? What do you think?"" He just stared at me for a moment and this is when I first realized he was pissed. I apologized and said ""do you feel attacked? I wasn't trying to make fun, I thought you'd laugh"" I realize phrasing it that way may have seemed sarcastic.

 He proceeded to tear apart the concept, saying it was ""unethical,"" ""a breach of trust,"" and ""morally wrong."" He went on to say he was ""making judgements about my moral character"" and that ""this would never get past an ethics board.""

I apologized again and admitted I shouldn't have blindsided him, but he just said I should've asked permission. 

I apologized once more and he said ""no, don't apologize, it's really cool. Good work here. Just get out.""

Both of our tones the whole time were very professional but just thinking about the way he told me to get out made me sick. That was about 24 hours ago, and now I have to see him in class pretty soon.

I've been thinking about it for a long time and yeah, I definitely should've gotten permission. I didn't because I thought that'd make it funnier, and that it would've affected the data. But hindsight makes me think I should've asked.

94,1cmcc6d,AITA - For refusing to keep lending my Dad money,"First time posting so apologies if I do something wrong....

 Dad (66M) has hit bad times, when I (42M) was younger he and my mum were not together but he was a Dad and he was a great Dad, he bought what I needed, I visited him on weekends, we went on holidays etc.

About 10 years ago he got married and all was good for a few years, then my Nan (his mom) died so they  
moved into the family home, Nan also left money to Dad and me, but my Nan did something and the house was owed by the bank, which my Dad didn’t know.

At same time a person my dad screwed over in their joint business found out and decided was a good time to sue my Dad - which lasted months.

During all this, Dad kept his money issues hidden, just kept saying he would win, no issues etc

They wanted to go away due to the everything, and Dad asked me to co-signee on a loan for £10kish, he promised it was a cashflow issue and it wouldn’t be an issue, I wasn’t thrilled but he was my Dad and I didn’t know about the money issues so I considered and talked with my partner,  as she had some money from her Dad, it was better to lend him that instead.

My Dad lost the case and could no longer do his job (not too sure the reasoning, but he worked  
in financing and I think he was declared bankrupt)

They had to sell the house as they didn’t have the money to pay the loan my Nan took against it.

This caused friction in their marriage, and after some money/jewellery went missing my Dad was blamed, the marriage was broken, they eventually got divorced.

Never got the £10k back my dad borrowed off of us

The Money my nan left me (£2kish) my Dad said went to the person that sued him, I didn’t question, after talking with my ex-Stepmom, she said that he was keeping it to get himself back on his feet, I didn’t complain about this nor tell him I knew.

He wasn’t earning lots and he had to work in car sales, it paid poor but earned commission, he lived in a rented house, then Covid hit and the landlord evicted him out (illegally) and he was put into a hotel, which he is still in as he cant afford to move.

He keeps asking me to lend him money, £10/20/30 etc... as he is short and can’t buy food etc.. sometimes it’s just £20 for a week or he would keep asking for more and at one time I think he owed about £90. I would get it back, although sometimes far longer than promised.

The issue, it was pretty much weekly, so I would lend/get back/lend/get back etc and after months, I said enough I cant keep money available just in case. Costs are going up, mortgage sky rocketed, I have my own family to take care of. 

I told him not to ask anymore, he would leave me be for a bit, then he would ask how we all were and chat and then 5 messages in he would ask for money... I called him out and said he only talks to me when he wants money, he disagrees, but I have the messages.

Multiple times I say no more, but I cave sometimes & lend something, he is my Dad & he always was there for me.

95,1cmc5el,AITA for snapping at my friend’s gf when she wouldn’t stop bringing up our past? ,"My family friend “Caleb” and I made the mistake of dating when we were younger (16-18 on and off). It was a disaster of a “relationship” that was just a lot of hormones and hurt feelings. It took us a long time afterwards to get to a place where we were friends again and meetings between our families wasn’t awkward anymore. But we’re there now. I consider him a good friend, not a super close one in the sense we don’t really hang out much because we’re busy and don’t live near each other but I’ve known him my whole life, there will always be a bond there. 

Caleb’s gf “Gretchen” is obsessed with the fact that we used to date. And I don’t say obsessed lightly, it’s the only thing she will reference when we are in the same room. She will bring it up when it has no relevance to the conversation. We (the whole group) will be talking about our favourite holiday destination and she will be like “oh did you guys ever go on holiday there while you were together?”. What does it matter? Or if we are in our home town she will be like “is this where you guys would come on dates?”. Just…why? She has even asked me incredibly weird things like whether we lost our virginity to each other. I’ve told Caleb this is beyond creepy and she needs to stop bringing up the past and he agrees, but also said it’s pretty normal that she would be curious about it (I don’t think this is normal). 

This past weekend we (my family and Caleb’s family) all had dinner because it’s Caleb’s half sister’s birthday. Gretchen was there and at one point the little girl (she’s 8) said I was her favourite “cousin” and Gretchen said “well she could have been your sister if she hadn’t dumped your brother”. I just lost it. I said something to the effect of “why are you so obsessed with the fact that we had a fling nearly a decade ago? You’ve spent more time talking about this relationship that we spent in it, it’s pathetic. What actually is the problem Gretchen?”. Gretchen didn’t say anything, but I demanded she answer the question. Caleb told me to just leave and I said I will leave it when she does. Gretchen called me a bitch which pissed off Caleb’s mother and then everyone was bickering. 

Everyone’s got different opinions on what I should have said, whether I should have said anything, timing, etc. but I’m on a character limit so I’ll just say it’s a pretty even split amongst several avenues. I just want to know if I was a dick for saying something instead of just putting up with her essentially picking at scar tissue.

We found out I was pregnant early December and announced it to our families on Christmas. Everyone was super excited and supportive till the end of March when it came time to find out the gender of the baby. My fiance and I decided not to have a gender reveal due to lack of money, space, energy and the fact that this pregnancy hasn't been the easiest for me(symptom wise).

 Everyone was okay and accepted that, understanding our reasons. Everyone but my MIL. She took it was a personal attack towards her and tried to beg or push us into letting her plan a reveal and that she'd pay for it. We still told her no as I would still have to plan for my family and my dad was working out of town a lot at that time. She since has been very rude to my fiance and I.

Everyone was super excited and supportive till the end of March when it came time to find out the gender of the baby. My fiance and I decided not to have a gender reveal due to lack of money, space, energy and the fact that this pregnancy hasn't been the easiest for me(symptom wise). We let our families know there would be no grand reveal and that it would just be announced through social media or personal calls.

 Everyone was okay and accepted that, understanding our reasons. Everyone but my MIL. She took it was a personal attack towards her and tried to beg or push us into letting her plan a reveal and that she'd pay for it. We still told her no as I would still have to plan for my family and my dad was working out of town a lot at that time. She since has been very rude to my fiance and I. We've done what we can to be civil and I've even kept my distance from her. 

I last saw her when we all got together for FILs birthday but she refused to say even a work to me. My fiances SIL talked to him about it a day or 2 after and told him that I wasn't handling the situation properly and that MIL was in the right. She said I'm the asshole for depriving MIL of this for her grandchild. MIL also thinks that I solely make this decision to hurt her even though my fiance has explained that we made this decision together for my health and what I could handle through this time. 

My friends and family say I'm not the asshole for doing what's best for us but the females in my fiance family say that I am the asshole. So AITA?",0.0,-0.0028234061319381,0,1

Often I’ll wake up when I hear him come in, but sometimes I don’t and continue sleeping (I often have to wear earplugs if the dawn chorus is super loud) 

This morning I woke up to my alarm  at 8:30 and he wasn’t in bed and I didn’t wake up hearing him get home.  Automatically I panic and my mind goes to the worst, he’s totalled his car before whilst driving tired and was very lucky to not have been seriously injured (yay for his Honda Jazz)

I went looking for him and it turns out he’d fallen asleep on the sofa whilst having a snack. 


I asked him to start coming into the bedroom and waking me up when he gets home just to let me know he’s home.  I would be waking up at 8:30 regardless anyway for work, so it’s not as if he’d be disturbing my sleep badly mid cycle . I’d rather he woke me up , than me waking up later to realise he’s not here and my mind going to the worst.  He’s point blank refusing to wake me up . 

In most cases when he’s arrived home and I’ve heard him, I’ve fallen back asleep within a minute.

He’s saying I’m being unreasonable in my request, AITA? 


Edit:  I’m not expecting him to come straight to bed etc, I know he needs time to decompress and eat and I don’t want to join him for that.

Me and my partner both work full time. I work from home 3 days a week, so I have the kids with me during those days, my partner is off on the Wednesday and takes care of the kids then. So both of the kids are in nursery on a Tuesday. He doesn’t usually like putting the kids to nursery whenever he’s off since he doesn’t want to lose time with them which is understandable. There are times when I end up working from home on a Tuesday and he gets it as a day off too. 
Now here’s where I might be the AH. I do the bare minimum during these days, since I’ve paid for nursery and they don’t give the money back if you don’t attend. He’s also the one who wants them at home. So I just feed the kids (1 and 3 years old) and I expect him to play and keep them entertained. I also expect him to deal with the nappy and potty times. I do give them cuddles when they ask. But it’s one of my only two days where I can work with no interruptions, as well as have a bit of me time, being able to eat without having the kids on me etc.
But he seems to expect me to also take care of them, especially with the 1 year, whenever he’s playing video games or when the little one’s crying. Since it’s also his day off which he barely gets. He works 5 days one week and 6 days the next.

Over drinks, I was sitting next to Jane and across from Nick and Emily. As far as I am aware, all three of them are single. 

We were chatting about dating apps and dating, going over the usual ""its so hard to date nowdays"" etc. After two beers, I turned to Jane and whispered ""I think those two would make a cute couple"", referring to Nick and Emily. She asked why and I explained because they are always hanging out around the office, joking, pranking each other etc. As this was happening, Emily and Nick were deep in their own conversation so they didn't really notice me saying this to Jane. My tone was playful and not very serious, and Jane just laughed and said ""maybe"". Then we moved on. 

Later that night I got a series of very angry texts from Emily. Turns out, Nick and Jane are secretly dating, which I had no idea about, and Jane thought its strange that I'm suggesting he would be a cute boyfriend to Emily. Emily also said I need to stay out of her personal life, never mention it again, and that I embarrassed her. I was shocked and confused to read this, but I also understand how I overstepped in my joking around and crossed some boundaries, and I apologised to her. She reiterated that I should not talk about her personal life again and I promised that I won't. 

Then the next day I went into the office and everything was normal with Nick and Jane. I quietly apologised to Jane too, but she just laughed it off and said it's not a big deal, and asked me to not tell anyone that she is dating Nick. Nick and I didn't talk about it, but we've been chatting like we usually do. I can tell neither of them mind or care. Emily, however, is still fuming.

She was a single teen mom who raised me “by herself”, and loves to remind me of it all the time. I’ve never gotten along with her through the years for various reasons, the main reason is her narcissism. Which brings me to our latest argument. 

My gpa (her dad) had a risky aortic aneurysm surgery back in late oct. The surgery caused him to have several strokes and numerous complications because of it. 

They eventually moved my gpa to a nursing home closer to home, so my gma came back. Several times, there was some complication surrounding my gpa care, and my gma would turn to me for help in the situation. I’d help as much as I could but tried to get my mom involved as much as possible since it’s her own parents that need help. 

Over this past weekend (5/4), we got the news that he wasn’t doing good and will most likely not survive the week. The whole family (my aunt, 2 uncles, sister, and cousins) came to the nursing home to say our goodbyes. My mom came late and left after 30 minutes while the rest of us stayed all day. My uncle and I stayed the latest to ensure the night nurses knew his med schedule. That’s when my gma broke down crying that she “had the strength to walk this road alone up until now and she can’t do this part alone”. I promised we would figure out how to all be here now.

103,1cmao30,AITA for refusing to help my wife's family anymore?,"I (34m) got married 9 years ago to my wife Jessica (33f). Jessica and I have two children Robyn (7f) and Theo (5m). Growing up I didn't have a family. I was a foster kid who was bounced around a lot because sometimes my bio mother would take me back but she'd always end up losing custody again or placing me back. When she finally stopped trying I was 11 and too old for most people who wanted babies or really little kids. So I aged out of the system without being adopted or finding a family.

I had hoped when Jessica and I met that I'd be welcomed by her family. But that's not how it went. Took me years to figure it out though. They look down on me. They're not totally obvious about it but I see it in the way they are with me vs the way they're with the other sons/daughters in law. Like asking them about Christmas plans but saying they didn't expect us to do anything else because I don't have a family. Or asking about the others jobs and promotions but never me, then acting so shocked both times Jessica or I mentioned I was promoted. There was a time when my SIL mentioned a foster kid who won a scholarship to college and it made it into the local news. The whole family's reaction was ""oh wow a foster kid making it to college is so unexpected"" and Jessica pointed out I went to college. They looked a little uncomfortable and I heard two of her siblings whisper something about ""Jessica and that story"" so I assume they believed she lied about where we met.

They don't make an effort for my birthday. They make assumptions that I don't spend time with my kids. They assume any effort made by me is me doing it for Jessica and don't believe me when I say it's not.

Yet they will always ask for my help with repairs around the house or assembling something, because I'm good at that stuff. I have helped Jessica's parents and all her siblings at least twice. Once I realized (with help from therapy) that they really didn't like me and seem to think less of me for being a foster kid, I did that stuff for Jessica and not for them. But then a few weeks ago Jessica's parents had issues with the stairs. I went and fixed them up. I was hours working on one part and had to go and get extra materials. It was a whole thing. Some of the family came over while I was there and Jessica's parents made food for them... but nothing for me. When I asked them if there was any for me they told me they didn't think I'd want to eat after working so hard... for hours... with no food in between. I told them they didn't think that, they simply didn't want to be polite to me and offer food after doing all that work for them. I was called out by Jessica's parents and her siblings. Jessica took my side as did some of the the siblings spouses. But I was called out again for not helping fix a shelf for one of Jessica's sisters and saying never again would I help any of them. They said family helps family. I asked them when they ever treat me like family.

I had hoped when Jessica and I met that I'd be welcomed by her family. But that's not how it went. Took me years to figure it out though. They look down on me. They're not totally obvious about it but I see it in the way they are with me vs the way they're with the other sons/daughters in law. Like asking them about Christmas plans but saying they didn't expect us to do anything else because I don't have a family. Or asking about the others jobs and promotions but never me, then acting so shocked both times Jessica or I mentioned I was promoted. There was a time when my SIL mentioned a foster kid who won a scholarship to college and it made it into the local news. The whole family's reaction was ""oh wow a foster kid making it to college is so unexpected"" and Jessica pointed out I went to college. They looked a little uncomfortable and I heard two of her siblings whisper something about ""Jessica and that story"" so I assume they believed she lied about where we met.

They don't make an effort for my birthday. They make assumptions that I don't spend time with my kids. They assume any effort made by me is me doing it for Jessica and don't believe me when I say it's not.

Yet they will always ask for my help with repairs around the house or assembling something, because I'm good at that stuff. I have helped Jessica's parents and all her siblings at least twice. Once I realized (with help from therapy) that they really didn't like me and seem to think less of me for being a foster kid, I did that stuff for Jessica and not for them. But then a few weeks ago Jessica's parents had issues with the stairs. I went and fixed them up. I was hours working on one part and had to go and get extra materials. It was a whole thing. Some of the family came over while I was there and Jessica's parents made food for them... but nothing for me. When I asked them if there was any for me they told me they didn't think I'd want to eat after working so hard... for hours... with no food in between. I told them they didn't think that, they simply didn't want to be polite to me and offer food after doing all that work for them. I was called out by Jessica's parents and her siblings. Jessica took my side as did some of the the siblings spouses. But I was called out again for not helping fix a shelf for one of Jessica's sisters and saying never again would I help any of them. They said family helps family. I asked them when they ever treat me like family.

104,1cmakso,AITA for keeping my current work schedule?,"My apologies I'm on mobile.
For context, I (22f) have been working at my current company for about 3 years now, when I started I was often bullied by the older women in my department. Some days are better than others now, my job allows me to be on my own a lot so I don't have to talk to anyone. Sadly I have a lot of stories about these women but we'll focus on the newest chapter, which happened a few hours ago.
Now for more background on this situation. A few months ago I had asked my boss if I could change my hours from 7am-3:30pm to 6am-2:30pm because my mom needed a ride home from work, she got out at 2:30pm and it's about a 30 minute drive from my work to hers. My boss agreed pretty quickly and so for about 5ish months now I've been working from 6am-2:30pm.
Well about 2 months ago my bf asked me to move in with him, this led to my mom moving forward and finding a vehicle she can use o get to and from work. Well over the weekend I finally moved in completely.
The issue, today I overheard my coworkers complaining that they wanted different hours and how they asked but got denied (I'm unsure of how true it is) One who I will refer to as Gene, was bad mouthing me and on top of that had reveled that shes been watching me leave work for a few weeks now and noticed that I don't always go the way to pick up my mom. INFO( Fridays my moms bf picks her up so I would usually just go to my bfs place, boss was cool with it)
I like my current hours, I'm currently doing college part time and having that extra hour to get assignments done/study helps a lot. At the same time I know that they're right about the fact that I don't need to leave early anymore to collect my mom. I talked with my boss and he's perfectly fine with me keeping my hours as is. ""There's no difference to me"" were his words.
So, AITA for wanting to keep my current work hours even though I don't need them anymore.

So I am 27F, bf is 27M. We have a one-year-old daughter together. I work full time, go to school full time, as well as running my own business. I also do 100% of the household chores, cooking, & caring for our daughter. Physically & financially (he pays very little for a sitter & diapers maybe 1-2 every 6 months). 

He also works full time, longer shifts, more days off. When he’s not at work he’s behind a computer screen, gaming. If he’s not gaming he’s usually asleep or watching sports. He does nothing outside that except on the occasion he decides to vacuum. He does watch our daughter 2-3 days a week while I’m at work but games the second I get home. 

My daughter & I are getting over some sickness, maybe the flu. We’ve had it about a week. He now thinks he’s getting it, after I asked him to help with laundry on his off days (wash & dry only) he always is sick when I need help. He did ONE load yesterday after reminding him over & over.

107,1cm8xeh,AITA for not wanting to play Auntie ,"I (25F) have always had a close relationship with my sister (W, 19)

W met J (23) when she was 18. They were friends with benefits initially and then started working together in a restaurant/pub where J’s mum was the landlady. 

Between Jan - March this year, W was constantly calling me for hours on end, telling me all the things J was doing which in my opinion is mental abuse. 

I.e would call her childish and immature in arguments despite her being 4 years younger than him, attacks her looks, what she wears, etc. there’s lots more. 

For the past couple of months I have been trying to support W to leave the relationship, but they would break up, he’d come crawling back with the ol’ love bombing tricks and she’d go right back to him. 

Then she announced she was pregnant. J told his whole family literally 10 minutes after in the local pub. 

I expressed to W about the man she is choosing to have a child with, and how concerned I am for her wellbeing. I said I will support her, but there’s no point trying to raise a baby with a man like that. 

They actually broke up again a few days after the news came out, and I felt like she was ready to do it on her own, she wasn’t crying or sad over the situation, she hated the way he was treating her. 

Then she goes to Tenerife with him for two weeks. 

I ranted to my mum about the situation, not about W, more about the boy, and our mum must have mentioned my frustrations to W when she returned from holiday, as I received a very strong worded message basically telling me to mind my own business and to not speak badly about the father of her child. 

So I’ve wiped my hands of her. I personally cannot be bothered to keep repeating myself and I’ve lost sympathy. I also have AUDHD so I just can’t comprehend the situation without getting irrationally triggered. 

I said I have no interest in the situation anymore, I don’t care for the life she’s trying to build and I certainly am not excited for a new arrival that is most probably gonna have a shitty childhood. Neither of them work, don’t have licences, no financial stability, both live with their parents. 

My partner agrees with me, but my mum and immediate family believe that I’m being way too harsh, my sister needs me now more than ever, and they might work it out.

She and I were in the same class so we naturally started a friendship. We went through the rest of elementary school and middle school as friends, but grew apart in high school when she moved to another city. We still kept in touch though. Mary’s husband to be is her elementary school crush Nati (24M) who I also used to be friends with. 

I filled out the RSVP card when I got the invitation and saw I was allowed a plus one. I asked my best friend (24F, Leah) if she would want to be my plus one, since she knew the groom and was once friends with him. She agreed and I wrote her in as my plus one and sent the RSVP back. Yesterday I met up with my friend (24F, Lisa) who also went to elementary school with me, and I mentioned that Mary and Nati were getting married. 

She said she saw Mary post the proposal and was so happy for them. I then said that the wedding was going to be in the fall and that I couldn’t wait to see them. She kind of paused then asked “*you* got invited?” I was confused on why she was so surprised, but I said yeah and shrugged it off. She said it was nice of them to invite me, then started talking about how she used to have a huge crush on Nati and how they “almost went out”. 

The crush part was true, but they never almost dated. Lisa used to say that her biggest mistake in school was not telling Nati about her feelings. Nati was a super sweet guy and not too bad looking so I understand where her regret was coming from, but it was weird she was bringing it up now. I changed the subject and we dropped the topic. But a while later, she asked if I had a plus one. I told her I invited Leah and she said “Are you serious? She doesn’t even know them.” 

I pointed out how that wasn’t true and that Leah and Nati were friends in middle school, and how they also bumped into each other a few times in college. She said that’s different and that she wasn’t close with them like she was. All throughout elementary and middle school Lisa never actively hung out with either of them in or outside of school. Just knew them because of association. I asked her when they got so close and she couldn’t answer me because of “how long ago it happened”, but I already knew she was lying.

I told her I already RSVP’d and that I would be willing to pass along something at the wedding if she wanted me to. She said no and that I should have asked her first to be my plus one, and that Mary was rude for not inviting her even though we all went to the same elementary school. I said that Mary wasn’t obligated to invite everyone she went to elementary school with to her wedding. Then she got upset saying I was taking Mary’s side and that I was an ass for not including her as my plus one even though she really wanted to go. I couldn’t handle her anymore and left.

109,1cm7fk1,AITA for telling my sister she's not a kid anymore and needs to stop acting like one because it's getting real old?,"My parents adopted me and all my siblings. I (24m) have a full biological sister who was placed for adoption at the same time I was. For her it was from birth, me I was 2. We were placed in foster care together but it was very difficult for us to be placed together. We're black so that went against us and because we were a set and it was decided early on we'd be placed together. We're the only biologically related siblings in our family. All my other siblings are singletons from their birth families. For me it doesn't matter. I love and am close to all my siblings and my sister is not my favorite or the one I'm closest to. My brother who is basically the same age as me is my ""favorite"" if I had to pick but I really love them all.

My sister always had more of an issue than me growing up with her identity and she obsessed more over biological relationships. She expected us to be the closest because we're biological siblings. She expected me to be just as interested as her in finding our birth family, which I'm not and never was.

I told my parents about it when we were kids and they tried their very best to help her with therapy and fostering open communication and not treating us differently in a negative way (we were all treated different in some ways because we're all different people and had different needs).

One thing my sister and I always bickered about was imagining our birth family. She liked to imagine what they were like and what meeting them would be like and she wanted to do this out loud with me and for me to share mine as well. I never did that with her and I told her it was not something I would ever be comfortable doing because I would never want to know them like she wanted to. She hated that and would tell me one day we'd find them together. 

When it came to her wanting to be my favorite because biologically related, I tried to be more calm and understanding about that.

But she's 22 now and she's not a kid. We're both still ""young"" but I fully believe we're not kids anymore and I hate that she still puts it on me to choose her over my siblings or that she won't find our birth family alone because I don't want to be a part of that.

She brought it up again a few days ago and I lost my temper a little and I told her to grow up because she's not a little kid anymore and she needs to stop acting like she is. I told her she's my sister and I love her but she's not my only sibling and she's never going to be. Then I told her I do not care if our birth family wants to know us. I don't want to know them and I'm not going to ignore that just because she wants to know them.

She got so upset. I can tell it kind of shattered her.

I told my parents about it when we were kids and they tried their very best to help her with therapy and fostering open communication and not treating us differently in a negative way (we were all treated different in some ways because we're all different people and had different needs).

One thing my sister and I always bickered about was imagining our birth family. She liked to imagine what they were like and what meeting them would be like and she wanted to do this out loud with me and for me to share mine as well. I never did that with her and I told her it was not something I would ever be comfortable doing because I would never want to know them like she wanted to. She hated that and would tell me one day we'd find them together. 

When it came to her wanting to be my favorite because biologically related, I tried to be more calm and understanding about that.

But she's 22 now and she's not a kid. We're both still ""young"" but I fully believe we're not kids anymore and I hate that she still puts it on me to choose her over my siblings or that she won't find our birth family alone because I don't want to be a part of that.

She brought it up again a few days ago and I lost my temper a little and I told her to grow up because she's not a little kid anymore and she needs to stop acting like she is. I told her she's my sister and I love her but she's not my only sibling and she's never going to be. Then I told her I do not care if our birth family wants to know us. I don't want to know them and I'm not going to ignore that just because she wants to know them.

She got so upset. I can tell it kind of shattered her.

110,1cm7d6r,AITA for shouting at my husband at a family gathering? ,"I(25F) and my (27M) husband had a child 3 months ago but the pregnancy was hard on my body especially after the delivery I have stretch marks all over my stomach and i also got diagnosed with PPD, well I am working on it now and doing better day by day but since my delivery I have been extremely tired taking care of the baby and stuff but since last two weeks I started going to the gym again with my husband. One thing which irked me was he always made remarks about my stretch marks and how I should be somewhat better by now ( he was talking about my body ) and how it always ""turned him off"". I kept up with it since I didn't have any mental strength to argue. 

But 4 days ago when I was feeding the baby, he again made a remark about my stretch marks I don't know what happened inside me but I shouted back at him and literally berated him about it so much that the baby started crying, I took the baby and went to the spare bedroom to sleep. Well since that day he has been giving me the cold shoulder and we only ever talk when it's about the baby.

Yesterday we had to go to his mom's house for a family gathering and midway through the night when all the people were present in a single room she brought up the topic about *my* body and my stretch marks and basically said its not normal that I still have them and must not be doing enough to get rid of them well all the people ages 40+ chimed in my MIL's support I was so embarrassed and ashamed by this that I left midway but I did shout at them and I left without my husband. 

I drove to my sister's home with the baby and am living here since yesterday. Most our mutual friends ( specifically guys) support him and have bombarded me with messages about how I overreacted and it's my fault well so did my husband this morning saying how I am overreacting and it's nothing I should just come back, etc, etc. 

I haven't replied to any of them but I don't have the mental capacity to even think about it but I do think I shouldn't have shouted at them and I was wrong but I need an outside perspective. 

So AITA? 

PS: my husband has always been supportive and caring even during and after the pregnancy, the stretch marks on my body are the only thing he complained about and for the first time since we are married did he complain about anything.

111,1cm7bqx,AITA for getting mad at my friend for bringing my ex to a gathering with my boyfriend ,"Edit to clarify: apologies for not explaining this part very well in the post: we are still friends, we still meet up everytime were both here and talk often on the phone. This fight did not ruin our friendship, disagreements happen in all friendships and thats fine.


This happened a couple of years ago but has now resurfaced.

I (F23 at the time) have a childhood friend (F23 also) who i see on holidays when we both go back to our hometown. One of my ex boyfriends is a relative of hers so I will sometimes see him around when im with her, which is fine.

I have no issues with this ex, were friendly and my friend has seen us interact in a friendly way plenty of times.
At that time i was in a relationship with a guy (22M) and he had come visit me in my hometown for the summer. Me, him my friend and another friend had arranged to go out to a bar, me and him got there first and then my friend got there, with my ex in tow. She said something like ""hey I bumped into ex on the way"". I didn't have time to explain to my bf who he was, but I didn't feel comfortable pretending that this was just some random guy so I just kind of whispered to him at some point. My bf is not a jealous guy or anything, but he definitely felt uncomfortable, and also he wanted to spend a nice night with his gf and her friends, not his gfs ex.

The night was a bit awkward, and after we left I told my friend that I didn't like that she brought him without at least sending me a warning message, she got mad and told me that I had never had a issue with him joining so she didn't think that it would be an issue now. I also got mad and told her that it was obviously different when I am on my on vs when I am bringing my bf into the mix, who has also never come here before and doesn't know anyone other than me, and that it's obvious that he would be uncomfortable.

Her argument was basically that since me and ex are just friends and there is nothing between us (which is very true lol, there is nothing there at least on my part) and my bf is not jealous, it shouldn't be an issue.
Again this happened a while ago, and we met back up in my hometown for easter, and my ex was walking by and came by to say hello. She asked me about that day and we kind of got to talking about this conflict and it made me think about if i was TA

116,1cm6oia,AITA for saying I don't care about my half sister's wedding and I don't even wanna go?,"So my half sister is 20 something. I think she's 26/27 but I don't know. We're not close enough for me to remember her exact age even though we lived in the same house when I was younger. I'm 16f.

Half sister lost her dad when she was 5 or 6 years old and then mom met my dad and they got married and had me and my two younger siblings who are 13 and 12. I was still in elementary school when half sister moved out and she basically had nothing more to do with me. She'd visit to see mom but she didn't care about the rest of us and would be forced civil if you know what that means. Like you could see she was forcing herself to say anything to us and to not roll her eyes or look disgusted that we were there.

I remember being 9 and hearing her and mom fight outside the house one day with half sister telling mom to stop acting like my dad was part of her family, that mom married him but he was just her husband and she was not going to treat him like he was her parent and my mom argued that dad had done nothing wrong and didn't deserve outright rejection of even a friendly relationship. Half sister told mom the only person in the house she cared about was her and that my dad could give her a kidney and she would still say he's ""just moms husband"" and she wouldn't care if we (dad, me, siblings) dropped dead because we meant nothing to her, not even a little.

Half sister is getting married now and I'm so over all the talk and fighting about it. The fight came from half sister saying dad wasn't going to have any kind of role in her wedding and neither were my siblings or me. She said we were tolerated guests and nothing else. Dad had hoped he would get a dance with her at least. Mom wanted that for him as well because she feels like my dad has done a lot for half sister over the years and has always done his best to be a good member of her family. Half sister said we're only invited because of mom and that's all there is to it.

My parents talk about it a lot and they were talking about whether mom should go alone but they didn't wanna upset us by making us miss our ""big sister"" getting married. I jumped in unannounced and said I didn't care about her wedding and didn't wanna go. My mom looked so devastated to hear that. My dad spoke to me after and said I could have handled it a lot better because all four of us are mom's kids and she never wanted our relationship with half sister to be so bad.

Afterward mom apparently talked to my grandparents/her parents and they asked me why I had to be so cruel and didn't I realize giving up means there is no hope for a good relationship with half sister in the future and how unfair that is to mom.

117,1cm6krs,AITA for not telling my travel buddy about my travel insurance reimbursement ,"My friend and I went travelling in America. I had travel insurance and I assumed she did too. During our travels in one state our camper van broke down and we had to bail on it - we received a a full refund for it. We had to pay for additional accomodation due to the camper breaking down and new car which pretty much was covered because of the camper refund. 

While over there I figured I might as well try and claim some of the cost due to misadventure with the camper van. I got papers from the travel company and all receipts, as most of the bookings were done with me. We had Splitwise at the time so we just billed each other this way.  

The back and forth with the travel insurance company continued long after I returned home and I had to keep providing evidence. I didn’t think I’d ever get anything back. My friend lived in a different country at the time and I know she didn’t bother to do a claim. 

A few months later after I returned home I received about $600 back from my travel insurance and I didn’t bother to tell her as it was my insurance and it slipped my mind as she was in a different country. 

I recently told her about the insurance claim as she’s now back in my country and we had drinks together. She has seemed annoyed that I never told her and has made jokes that I owe her half of it. I have started to buy her things to pay her back and I’m considering giving her half of the return. Since returning to the country she has crashed with me on and off for over a month with no payment towards accommodation. 

My question is - should I give her half of the money I received from my travel insurane as she put in for the accommodation and car over there, or do I leave it as it was my travel insurance and I was the one who made the claim? My only concern is that she probably never bothered to make a claim as most of the bookings were under my name, even though she never expressed this at the time. AITA if I don’t transfer her the dosh? Happy to transfer but want to hear your thoughts. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-07,"AITA for not telling my travel buddy about my travel insurance reimbursement  My friend and I went travelling in America. I had travel insurance and I assumed she did too. During our travels in one state our camper van broke down and we had to bail on it - we received a a full refund for it. We had to pay for additional accomodation due to the camper breaking down and new car which pretty much was covered because of the camper refund. 

While over there I figured I might as well try and claim some of the cost due to misadventure with the camper van. I got papers from the travel company and all receipts, as most of the bookings were done with me. We had Splitwise at the time so we just billed each other this way.  

The back and forth with the travel insurance company continued long after I returned home and I had to keep providing evidence. I didn’t think I’d ever get anything back. My friend lived in a different country at the time and I know she didn’t bother to do a claim. 

A few months later after I returned home I received about $600 back from my travel insurance and I didn’t bother to tell her as it was my insurance and it slipped my mind as she was in a different country. 

I recently told her about the insurance claim as she’s now back in my country and we had drinks together. She has seemed annoyed that I never told her and has made jokes that I owe her half of it. I have started to buy her things to pay her back and I’m considering giving her half of the return. Since returning to the country she has crashed with me on and off for over a month with no payment towards accommodation.

118,1cm6db4,AITA for finding a replacement roommate the same night my boyfriend dumped our summer housing plans? ,"My boyfriend and I are in college, and we’re currently facing the issue of housing. I was able to find on campus housing for next year, but unfortunately he was not able to. He didn’t want to look for a housing group together, which I didn’t fight him on because I get it. However, we’re both staying on campus for summer session, and have planned months ahead to house together during the summer. 

When he did find a housing assignment, the group was moving in DURING the summer, which meant he could not house with me and left me having to find another roommate VERY last minute. 

Here’s where my problem comes in, he’s in this specific club, and the people he’s housing with are in this club. Throughout the history of him being in this club, he’d constantly ditch plans we’ve had together, to go to club arranged parties which were not mandatory. I absolutely understand mandatory events, but either check what’s in your schedule before planning things with me, or prioritize the first thing you planned..? In this way, some of the most recent incidents involved him inviting me over to his place for a sleepover, getting a text from the club that there’s a party, him leaving within 20mins of inviting me over, and telling me he’d be back by 1:30am. He in fact was not. The only reason he even came back is because i texted him at 3am, telling him I’m done waiting for him and i’m going to bed in my own dorm. He hadn’t texted or notified me before this, and he would not have.  He also decided to skip out on plans I made for us on our anniversary, to go to a non mandatory party by the group. And again, last minute ditching on summer housing. He didn’t even TRY to look for housing himself, he just waited for the text that he couldn’t even be sure would come.  I ended up getting one of my friends on board for rooming, and he’s upset over the fact that I’m upset. I have no idea what else I could’ve done, and i’m tired of it.

120,1cm5vxr,AITA for wanting to dye my hair?,"My mum (38f) and I (17f) were in the car this afternoon, driving to my work, and I had brought up the question ‘where could I go to get my hair bleached?’ 
I’ve always been praised for my long dark and thick hair, and I did love my hair, but as of late, I’ve wanted change. All the girls in my school were dying their hair, but I wasn’t, and I really wanted to as well. I wasn’t satisfied with my appearance anymore. 
After my mum had answered my question, she started giving me less of suggestions and more orders. She told me ‘don’t dye your whole head’ and ‘get this’, it started to feel like she didn’t want me to dye my hair at all. 
I reminded her that I was paying with my own money from working, and that I was doing everything myself, but she continued to tell me I was wrong. Then she told me ‘you’ll look stupid.’ Without a response, I looked down at my phone and shut up. 
I’ve seen heaps of girls dye their whole head suddenly, going brunette to blonde, and they were fine. Their hair still looks healthy. I’ve seen my own mum do it, but why was it different if I did it?
At my silence my mum just got more upset, telling me that ‘you don’t know anything about hair’ and ‘you’ll always be stuck with brown hair, if you like it or not’. Sure I will, but hair is hair, it grows back. 
If anything bad happens to my hair, let it be, I’ll learn and grow. I didn’t want to be 19 bleaching my hair for the first time for it to end horribly.

123,1cm5f32,AITA for not wanting my sister soon to be boyfriend coming to my home?,"Update:
So I reached out to my sister one more time about me meeting him outside of the house rather than in the house. I told her that I was uncomfortable with her bringing him over. She replied that I was using my pregnancy as an excuse. She also mentioned that I was okay with him coming over the first time, but now I'm not. She said she was trying to involve me in her life, which I didn't do by not letting her meet my husband until after 7 months of me dating him. Mind you, she knew about him when we first started dating, but I didn't want them to meet in person until we dated for a while. She also finds it weird that I'm OK with inviting another guy who I hadn't spoken to but not the guy who I had spoken to. Plus, she mentioned how the guy was uncomfortable with her always driving, so he asked that they meet at my place instead of her driving all the time, which i found suspicious. 

I replied back to her, saying that I wasn't using my pregnancy as an excuse as I am heavily pregnant and my first priority is myself and my unborn child. I told her thar I don't understand why she is not taking my offer to meet him outside of the house, if this was really about me meeting him. I told her that I was comfortable with the other guy coming over because that was her friend, not someone she wanted to be in a relationship with. I always told her that I was okay with friends coming over, as long as she gave me enough notice. I mentioned the reason why I asked my husband to lie was because she had ignored me, telling her that I was uncomfortable more than once. Plus, the rules I made about her friends coming over don't apply to her date. I mentioned about how one of her online dates turning out to be a creep and followed us everywhere, including adding me and her friends on instagram and trying to follow us to our church. I mentioned that I wasn't okay with that. I let her know 3 weeks was not enough time to know a person and bring him home. Plus she already told this guy about where I work and how much I made, which is why I find it suspicious that he calls me rich and wants to keep coming over to my place using her driving as an excuse. 

She replied that she didn't mean to say I was using my pregnancy as an excuse. She also said the creepy guy, she made him drop her at my neighbors place, but he made it his mission to find my address. Which he did, and he would come to our area all the time despite living 42 mins away from me. Next, she told me that she followed all my rules and was going to clean the house, and she called my husband as well for his permission. She said she had already informed the guy that he could come over today. This was prior to her asking for my permission and my husband's. She told me that I was making her look stupid to him by telling him that he couldn't come over. And she doesn't understand why I do not understand that the only reason he wanted to come over was because he was uncomfortable with her driving all the time. I find all of these weird that she is more concerned about looking stupid to him and trying to meet his request rather than me saying I don't feel comfortable and my priority is protecting my child?

My sister (20) moved in with me (26) when she found out that I was pregnant. She has been nothing but amazing so far. My sister started going on dates online and meeting guys in the city. So far, everyone of them met her at the front of apartment. I was really uncomfortable with people knowing my address as I had issues with stalkers before. But I thought about how she moved to a new city because of me and she needed to make friends. 3 weeks ago, she met this guy, he introduced her to his friends and family. She really likes him, but they are bot dating yet. She told me he wanted to meet me, and I told her that I was okay with that. Except she wanted him to stay late through the night so I told her I wasn't comfortable with that. I told her that I wanted to know him first before he could come in and out of my place especially with me being pregnant. So she wanted to invite him during the day, so I told her no as well, as I wasn't comfortable. I have spoken to him on the phone out of courtesy but inviting to my place was a no. So today, she asked if he could come over again, so I asked her to reach out to my husband, and if he says yes then I'm OK with it. But I reached out to my husband and asked him to say no, as she wasn't listening to me. After that she called me crying and asking me how do I expect to know if I don't let him come over, and that she was treated nice by his family but I don't treat him nice as I am not inviting him to my home. I sent her a text explaining my discomfort. The reasons were she met him 3 weeks ago, they weren't in a relationship yet and I am pregnant so I am concerned about my safety. I gave a compromise that I will be okay if they atleast dated for 3 weeks. I also told her that I asked my husband to tell her no, as she was giving him attitude and ignoring his greetings. She replied to me saying that the fact I lied made her uncomfortable. And she was trying to involve me in her life by bringing him in over, and she doesn't need me to be concerned about her as she is grown and can protect herself. And she is not talking to me after that. AITA for not wanting the guy in my house? She is confused on why I don't understand the reason why he wanted to come over.

I have a pod coffee machine that I like. It uses fully recyclable aluminum pods not plastic. I leave it in the kitchen and I let everyone use it. 

  
It wasn't a problem when everyone bought their own pods. Then mine started going missing from my shelf. I asked and none of my roommates admitted to taking them. It stopped for a while. Then it started up again. So I started keeping my pods in my room. All was good in the world. 

  
I made the mistake of leaving an unopened box of my pods in the pantry on my shelf. When I went to get it there were five missing. I know it is not a big deal. I know they cost like a dollar each. But it is the principle of the thing. 

  
I bought a sleeve of decaf coffee and a sleeve of decaf double espresso. I opened them and left them on my shelf. They slowly disappeared over the week. I bought more. The whole experiment cost me about $40. On Friday I asked everyone if they had taken my coffee if they could please pay me so I could go pick up some more. I pointed to the four empty sleeves of coffee and said I had not had even one of those. So either fess up or I would consider all food in the house fair game until I felt I was even. All three confessed they had borrowed a pod or two since they did not have a machine none of them thought to pick any up. I said that if they each sent me $15 I would pick up four more sleeves and leave them out to share. They each sent me the money. It is the cost of like three cups at a coffee shop. After I got the money I asked if they any requests for the pods. They all said to get whatever had more caffeine. I said that would not be too hard since the sleeves they emptied were decaffeinated. 

  
Now they are pissed off that they drank decaf for a week. They were wondering why they had no energy. I just pointed at the sleeve where it clearly says that the are decaf. I suppose they didn't bother looking when they were stealing my coffee. They called me a dick and said that I did it on purpose.

I suppose they didn't bother looking when they were stealing my coffee. They called me a dick and said that I did it on purpose. 

  
They are upset but not in any major way. But they do think I am a jerk for tricking them. One had the gall to jokingly ask for her money back. ",0.0,0.05351799353957176,0,1
125,1cm5380,WIBTA for not letting my friend’s buddy stay with us?,"Throwaway because I’m paranoid.

I m28 live with my best friend “Ronnie” m26 in a big city. The reason Ronnie and I live together was because a couple years ago my mom passed away and left me her house in her will, I didn’t know how to renovate a place and Ronnie was kind of the only person in my life who was there for me emotionally so he means a lot now and I love living with him.

Something important to bring up is that Ronnie is gay, or bi, he’s very cagey about the specifics, but I do know he dates men. I’m straight, but we’ve never had an issue regarding it, though every now and then I’ve had this feel that Ronnie likes me. 

So the problem in question started out when Ronnie reconnected with his friend from college, “Logan”. They’re in the same industry, and I’ve seen him every now and then, but he recently moved back in with his parents who are one city away. From the second I saw them talk I could sense something was there. They’re always together and even when they’re not speaking to each other it’s like they are. After asking, Ronnie said that he had on crush on Logan in college, but it never went anywhere because he’s straight. I asked a mutual friend of ours who also knew them in college, and she said Ronnie was actually in love with Logan. Apparently for the entirety of their program Logan was oblivious until they were about to graduate and Ronnie finally came clean and after that they seemed to grow even closer.

This made me feel really bad, and I was starting to suspect I could be jealous of Logan, but he didn’t come up to our city often enough to make me blow up. I think I’m just jealous of the kind of friendship they have ‘cus I thought I was the only one to have that with him. Things started to calm down until some weeks ago, when he landed a job in our city, in the same studio as Ronnie.

Apparently, Logan is fine with driving up an hour every day, but that he would appreciate it during some weekdays he could come crash just so he didn’t have to drive. It wouldn’t even be that often because he can work from home sometimes. So I said that Ronnie can decide because it’s his place too. He nodded and seemed kind of hesitant. 

When I went to bed that night I couldn’t sleep anymore. Now the thought of me having to wake up to them talking in our kitchen makes me want to puke. But I know I simply can’t change my mind now. Especially because I know they’re not gonna get together or anything.

I don’t even know what to make of this. I’ve been giving it some serious thought and it’s not like I like Ronnie. But also there’s another side of me that is really overthinking it, and I don’t think regular people get this jealous. When I look at Ronnie I kind of just want to cook him dinner and clean up his mess and close the cupboards he leaves open until I die, and I don’t think this is normal.

So would I be an asshole if I tell Ronnie that Logan can’t start crashing at our place just because I’m jealous?",No A-holes here,2024-05-07,"WIBTA for not letting my friend’s buddy stay with us? Throwaway because I’m paranoid.

To prep for my interview, I asked to practice with my sister in advance.

Because I don’t have a proper accent when I speak Spanish my sister often makes fun of the way I speak, which has made me feel discouraged from speaking the language in front of others. I told her that her laughing at me is the reason why I often do not reach out to help from her more often. She and my mother got upset with me for not taking the “joke.” AITA?

129,1cm4f6t,AITA for refusing to visit my MIL after she fat shamed me following the birth of my baby? ,"I (26f) and my husband (26m) just welcomed our first baby a few months ago. Him and I are overjoyed and I am so in love with our tiny bundle. My family has been super supportive, bringing us dinners and making sure we had time for napping while we adjusted to parent life. 

My husband’s family is different from mine in a lot of ways. They didn’t want to visit us and only wanted us to come to them (they live about 20 minutes away) and didn’t really care to offer much for support following the birth. We were fine with it and brought our baby over when we were able to - around 3 times a month. 

After the first month, my MIL began commenting about how much she prioritized “losing the baby weight” after she had her first baby. At first I didn’t think anything of it, I thought she was just voicing her experience as many people do when they are around babies. She then started commenting on my babies chubby cheeks, and how similar they are to mine. I felt a bit hurt but let it slide once again. The final straw was when my husband was talking to her casually about my wanting to start going on runs again and how we were planning on making it work since our baby is very attached to me. She very loudly said “you’re thinking about trying to run? Shouldn’t you start with walking?” His whole family was in the room and looked at me waiting for my answer. I am an avid runner who only stopped due to my pregnancy, and her comment really hurt. 

When I was a teenager I had a really bad eating disorder, one that I am still struggling with. Comments on my body or physical abilities are hurtful to hear, and she is someone who I knew talked about peoples bodies behind their backs, but I didn’t think she would be so mean to my face. I am not skinny by any means, but live a healthy and active lifestyle so weight should not be my concern. 

This is where I feel like the asshole. I don’t want to see her anymore. She makes me feel like crap about myself and my husband is backing me up 100%. His mom is angry because she thinks we are just keeping her grandchild away from her and believes it is unfair. He goes there without me but it is difficult to take our baby because she is exclusively breastfed and refuses bottles of any kind. 

AITA?


EDIT:

After reading the first few comments I realize that I left out some info. I am currently 5 months postpartum and have been fully cleared by my doctor to begin my running regiment.

I have given him 5 minutes breaks after 1 hour of lesson, whenever I feel like he’s becoming uninterested in lessons. His unwillingness to learn usually happens when teaching him English. I have tried different teaching methods and made English fun for him but he still showed lack of motivation for that subject. So on one lesson, I nagged at him for not putting effort and used the exact phrase, “if you don’t put in effort, even god can’t help you”.

We were just talking about random stuff, and looking at birds, until we saw it, a little girl throwing things at a squirrel. The squirrel was at the edge of a smooth ravine, the ground at the bottom of the ravine was flat, and the sides were completely vertical and smooth, I know squirrels are impressive, but I don't think one could climb out of that.

132,1cm3ryo,AITA for sending a friend who no longer wants to room with me because of how many times I got sick during the last school year explanations of why I keep contracting illnesses?,"I (25f) live in a house with 11 other people (20s f) who all attend a university in the area. My old roommate who we can call Kate (22f) just moved out a few weeks ago, and one of the other girls  who I’ll call Rachel (23f) was supposed to move in this week. However, that got pushed back due to me contracting the flu a few days ago. This morning when we spoke about it, Rachel still seemed excited to move into my room at a later point in time, once she would no longer be exposed to the flu; however, after a few hours, I texted her to ask her to pick up some Mucinex for me since I have had a fever and cannot drive, and in that conversation she told me that her mind had changed now that I have been sick for the 9th or 10th time in 12 months and that she no longer felt comfortable living with me if I was gonna be sick that often.

I felt blindsided and fairly upset by Rachel saying that, and since then I have messaged Rachel many different reasons for why I’ve been sick so many times (honestly, the most I have ever been sick in a year) including but not limited to that Kate only ever used hand sanitizer even after she went to the bathroom and never washed her hands, Kate never told me when she was sick and would constantly bring back illnesses that I would then catch because she would take no precautions to stop others getting sick, and almost every time I got that sick (excluding once over the summer), it was after I had been under an intense amount of stress due to my mother being in the hospital due to medical complications, and stress can effect your immune system. 

I think I may be the asshole because I keep messaging Rachel when new reasons and explanations pop into my head, and it may seem like I’m trying to convince her even though her mind’s already made up and I’m just being defensive because I feel upset. 

ETA: changed letters to fake names

ETA to clarify after some comments: I am not trying to convince Rachel to change her mind back. If she isn’t comfortable then she isn’t comfortable and I wouldn’t want her to force herself to live with me if she’d be constantly worried about being sick. I’m mostly upset that she waited until I’d been sick for a couple days, during all of which she expressed excitement to move in with me, and the way that she was talking about it implied that I had done something to get sick repeatedly or it was somehow my fault. 

ETA for further clarification: Either way, Rachel and I will still be sharing a bathroom and common areas. The only difference will be that we won’t share the room where we sleep or a closet, etc. 

ETA the next morning: Rachel and I talked this morning, and she apologized for wording everything the way she did, and I apologized for getting defensive.

I think I may be the asshole because I keep messaging Rachel when new reasons and explanations pop into my head, and it may seem like I’m trying to convince her even though her mind’s already made up and I’m just being defensive because I feel upset. 

ETA: changed letters to fake names

ETA to clarify after some comments: I am not trying to convince Rachel to change her mind back. If she isn’t comfortable then she isn’t comfortable and I wouldn’t want her to force herself to live with me if she’d be constantly worried about being sick. I’m mostly upset that she waited until I’d been sick for a couple days, during all of which she expressed excitement to move in with me, and the way that she was talking about it implied that I had done something to get sick repeatedly or it was somehow my fault. 

ETA for further clarification: Either way, Rachel and I will still be sharing a bathroom and common areas. The only difference will be that we won’t share the room where we sleep or a closet, etc. 

ETA the next morning: Rachel and I talked this morning, and she apologized for wording everything the way she did, and I apologized for getting defensive.

(I also only messaged her two or three times with reasons why I kept getting sick and stopped when I realized I might have been being a jerk about it)",4.0,0.03701334074139595,0,0

136,1cm39b2,WIBTA if I schedule my bf a doctor/dental appointment despite him refusing to seek care?,"I (26f) have been with my bf (28m) for 2 years now. My boyfriend has always shot down any suggestion to go to the doctor's for a check up or even the dentist for basic dental care. While he is relatively healthy, I do have some concerns about his health. 

For some background, my bf has been living a vegan lifestyle for the last 8-9 years. My concern is that he gets bruised easily, his blood doesn't clot quick after a cut, he takes long to heal. I can see on his face that he is not in the best health. He has dark circles under his eyes and some yellowing in the inner corners. His gums look somewhat swollen and sometimes red.

I don't think his diet is the best despite my best efforts. I am not vegan but I follow some vegan blogs and own some cookbooks that I get my recipes from. That and youtube are my resources. However, I don't think just me adjusting his diet will help his health improve without knowing what he is lacking in. I have talked to him about going to get bloodwork done after I noticed a bruise on his arm that has not faded in months. (He still has it as I post this) He always refuses and says that doctors are out for money or just to get you on meds that poison you. He says it in a sarcastic tone so I can't tell if he's serious or just wanting a reaction out of me. As for the dentist, his mom said he always hated it but she also has noticed the things I've mentioned.

Anyway, I found his current year insurance cards for both medical and dental. I have previously gotten him scheduled for an eye exam and his dogs to get their shots which he did go to. I just told him when and where and he attended. 

Since he refuses going to the doctors and dentist, WIBTA if I scheduled his appointments for him?

137,1cm2rh9,AITA for going to brunch with friends on Mother’s Day? ,"I 35f and my bf 37m of 4 years live together with my child 10m from a previous marriage.  In the past, I have told my boyfriend that I wanted to do something for Mother’s Day, and I would love to plan something together or for him to plan something.  He has never planned anything so I assumed he never would, and started baking with my son on Mother’s Day morning. 

Last week a friend asked me if I was doing anything for Mother’s Day. I told her what I sent my mom and that I don’t usually do much but my son and I cook together. She asked me if she could take my son and I to brunch. I told her that sounded amazing, but I needed to talk to bf first.  I asked him if he had anything planned. He looked at his calendar. he said “no, oh that’s Mother’s Day. No, I don’t have anything planned” I asked if he cared if we went with her. He said no, and walked off, so I texted her to confirm. 

About five minutes later, he came back in the room obviously mad. I asked what’s wrong? he said I can’t believe you would make plans without me like that. I said I literally just asked you and I didn’t think it would be a big deal because you’ve never planned anything before. He replied, I guess I’m just an asshole who cares right?

I wish I worded this differently but I said, I never called you an asshole. I simply stated what has happened in the past, if that’s what you infer from your behavior, that’s on you. 

I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong, but my boyfriend said that it’s a day we should be spending together and I’m torn.

138,1cm2q2y,AITA for confining our cats to the basement at night?,"My (29F) boyfriend (32M) and I have been together for over three years. I had a 4 year old dog when we got together and he had two cats, 2 & 3. 

When I bought my house, I paid a contractor to put in a dog door. We live on a quiet court that dead ends, and we’re also near the woods, so my bf decided that when he moved in he was going to allow the cats to use the dog door and be indoor/outdoor cats. 

The problem is… cats hunt. Inherently this is in their nature and it’s fine, but the point of contention in many arguments we’ve had is that they bring their prey into the house through the dog door. Alive or dead, but mostly alive. In the two years that he and the cats have lived here, there have been over 20 instances of them bringing in live birds, occasionally a dead bird, and mostly live mice. Again, rarely dead. We have both seen them bring these animals in multiple times. The birds fly and shit everywhere and leave feathers and the the mice shit in the pantry and probably other places we can’t see. 

I wanted to have the cats stay in the basement at night right from the get-go, but my boyfriend was adamant that he could train them to not bring in their prey. Spoiler alert… nothing he’s tried over the two years has worked. And I’m at my absolute wits end with dealing with wild animals in our home. Having the catch them and put them back outside and clean up the poop and feathers they leave is not only unsanitary but it makes me really sad for the prey and I cry and bury every dead one they’ve brought us. 

I don’t want to close the dog door at night because then that punishes the dog who has done nothing wrong… he wouldn’t be able to go outside whenever he wanted to. He is 8 now and has had access to a dog door and a yard since he was 1.

My bf insists I am TA because I want to keep the cats in the basement at night (nighttime is largely when they bring in their prey). The basement is 1,000 sq ft and our second living room with a huge comfy couch they like to sleep on. They also have multiple other beds, their litter box, their food bowls and a million toys. 

He’s making me think I’m the asshole because I should just close the dog door and have all three of them confined to the house all night. But I do not think that’s fair to the dog as stated before. We are waiting for a new tech product to come out (supposedly this summer) that will allow the animals to wear Bluetooth tags and have the door only open for the dog during specified nighttime hours. 

In the interim… I think the cats need to sleep in the basement. AITA?
