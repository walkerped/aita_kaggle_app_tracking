0,1cmukce,AITA for yelling at my dad over bread?,"So I (19m) got in a fight with my Dad (65m) over bread. A month ago i was at Trader Joes, I was looking around and found this sun dried tomato parmesan bread, so i bought some. Flash forward a couple days and i had eaten about half of it and it was just sitting in the pantry a couple days so my dad tried it and liked it, i hadn’t touched it in a couple days so he ate some and wrapped it up and put it back in the pantry. 

Most of what i had left was gone so i questioned him about it and he mentioned that it was going to start molding soon so he ate some. I understood and i didn’t care because i hadn’t touched it. My mom was going to Trader Joes soon and i asked her to get two so we could have our own. 

When we got the bread I noticed there were optional oven instructions on the back so i decided to save it until i could cook it in the oven, yet my dad immediately ripped into his and started eating on it then he put it in a ziplock baggie in the fridge. To avoid confusion i grabbed a sharpie and wrote “ZACHS ONLY DO NOT TOUCH PLEASE” over the entire front of the package. 

So a week went by and i asked my mom if she minded cooking it to which she agreed. (The only reason i don’t to it myself is because I’m inexperienced and knew id probably end up forgetting it in there and burning it. My mom would do a better job anyways and also my dad does not let me touch the oven) I went to get the bread but to my surprise it was in a big ziplock baggie. And it was right next to his which was half eaten in a different ziplock baggie. I pulled it out and it had a big chunk out of the top and i was upset because my dad eats with his fingers and licks them. 

Im a germaphobe, so i dont eat or drink after people. My dad came in the room and i was visibly upset. I questioned why he ate it, he said he didnt notice it was mine. I cut him off asking how he didnt since mine was marked, whole, and in a sealed package. I came off aggressive was not yelling, to which he responded by yelling that i could have some of his it wasnt a big deal. I frustratedly started yelling back and I said i was saving it and couldnt understand how he didnt notice that it was mine. I decided to walk away when he said “whats your problem are you on drugs again!?”

About two months ago i was arrested for having weed in my car and spent the night in jail which was the most traumatizing experience ive been through. Ive been clean since but was still really sore about it and he knows cause ive been upset with jokes hes made about it. The Police department is trying to seize my car since is paid off and they can get free money so he has been driving me most places.

I shut myself in my room and cried and he came to my door and yelled “good luck getting to school tomorrow (i have a big exam tomorrow) and to work next week” (im starting a second job cause i have so many fees from the arrest) needless to say im upset but conflicted since i did act out.

1,1cmu1hf,AITA for returning my father's gift because I felt it was much more important to him than it would be for me?,"So my father (54M) wanted to gift me (18M) a special watch of his as a birthday present. He told me that the watch is very, very important to him, as it was the first thing he had ever saved up and bought with his own money. He wanted to give me this watch, but he also told me that he only wanted to give it to someone that would actually wear it and can understand the importance of the watch.

The problem is that, while I understand that the watch is incredible important to him and that he really wanted to give it to me...I simply don't have that same kind of connection to the watch, and I don't think that I would actually wear it if he gave it to me. I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings, but I also didn't want to take something from him that obviously meant a lot to him if I knew deep down that it wouldn't be nearly as important to me. And I dom't really wear watches in the first place so...

When he did give it to me, it ended up just sitting on a countertop for days. He eventually took it back and later called me telling me that if I wouldn't wear it, then he wanted it back. At first, I told him that I would go ahead and start wearing it, then hung up. But as I thought about it, I decided the best thing I could do would be to be honest with him and tell him what I explained in the previous paragraph of this post, and ask him to keep it. He accepted, but it was clear to me that he didn't take it well and was quite irritated and hurt by me asking him to keep it.

Now I don't know if I did the right thing or not. I could've just kept it to save him from being hurt, but it just doesn't feel right telling him that i'm gonna wear it when I know i'm not and that in reality, it would probably just collect dust in a drawer. I don't wanna lie to him, but I also didn't want to hurt his feelings. AITA for making the choice I did?

EDIT: Me and my dad have come to an compromise. I'll wear the watch only on special occations, and then when I'm not wearing it i'll have it in a display case so it doesn't get damaged or collect dust. I still want something to remember my dad by regardless of whether i'll wear the watch often or not, so I feel like this is a fair compromise.

2,1cmtzxu,AITA for telling my roommate he can't have three people over?,"Okay, so I had spent the weekend taking care of a family member with cancer, and when I came back home to my apartment, I walked into three full grown people sleeping on the floor of my living room. We live in a small 800 sq ft apartment, and there are two bedrooms. One is mine, the other is my roommate's.  
  
Now, my roommate cannot afford to pay his half of the rent or utilities. Last month, his girlfriend paid his half of the rent for him. (He still hasn't paid her back). The reason he can't afford to pay rent or utilities is because he lost his job last month because he decided to sleep in and have a threesome with two girls instead of go to work. I was there when I heard him get the call from his boss to let him know he was fired.

Anyway, I covered his half of the utilities, which he still hasn't paid me back. And he can't afford rent or utilities for this month either. 

Now, my roommate is friends with only one of these three people I found sleeping in my living room. One is my roommate's friend's girlfriend, and then the third guy, neither of us know. They told me told that my roommate said that they could crash there. 

Now, I know that these three people do crack, and that they are homeless. My roommate didn't tell me he was inviting anyone or anything. ALSO, they left a huge mess in the kitchen and the bathroom. Dishes everywhere, mudprints all over the floor. Am I the asshole for telling my roommate that this wasn't cool?

3,1cmtu63,AITA for wanting to move in with my SO on the weekend her sister is visiting?,"My gf(26) and I (m26) have been together for 10 years. She recently moved from Texas to Washington state for a new job in February. I have been planning to join her, but had to wait for a bunch of paperwork approval in order to transition to full time remote work.

 After weeks of waiting in the dark, my approval finally came in so I began making plans of when I would drive up there. With it being so sudden, I was planning to try for next weekend (17-19) but was met with disappointment as my gf’s sister, who also lives in Texas, was coming to visit from 16-20. She says she wanted to spend that weekend alone with her sister and would prefer I move up memorial weekend a week later. I have been living at home with my parents making an hour commute to and from work. My plan of driving the 33 hours would have me arriving, ideally, Saturday night if I left Thursday evening. I insisted that I could stay with a mutual friend Saturday night to give them their time and would be fine setting up my work from home area in the other room Sunday. She still would prefer I wait another week in order to not affect her plans.

 I am upset because I was under the impression she could not wait for me to get there and I am dying to move back in with her as well as get out of my parents place as I have been living out of one suitcase while leaving everything else packed in the mean time. Am I being impatient? Should I honor her plans and wait the extra week? 

Edit: I have been stuck awaiting approval since the first week of March. I have been contributing to rent since she moved in, in March. My work does not honor the work from home until I move.

4,1cmtmlh,AITAH for arguing with my track coach about events?,"So for context, I, 18F do shotput and discus in track. I put a lot of effort and time into what I do and I'm pretty average, (30 ft shotput, 65ft discus) and there are these two other girls on my team, let's call them Annie and Frannie, Annie, is a pretty good thrower and she throws further than me, Frannie isn't the best thrower and she throws barely 21 ft in shot and 55 ft in discus, in our division they only take the top 2 throwers in each meet from each team to invitationals, I am the 2nd best thrower, however, every time we don't have to measure the throwing, frannie always gets put in discus before me. At this dual Meet (meet between 2 teams) she threw 55ft and I threw 60 ft (I was on a bad day) so that should mean I go to invitationals for discus since I threw further than her. (Annie is the best thrower on the team so she's not really a part of the story) I also threw shotput further than frannie. So i go to confirm with My coach, let's call him coach G, that I'm going to invites for both shot an discus since I threw further than Frannie. He says ""no, you're in shot and frannies in disc"" which is crazy because I throw more than her. So obviously, I tell him that, and he's like ""you only threw 5 feet more than her, give her a break,"" keep in mind, I train hours, I work hard to get where I'm at and frannie just kind of stands there and complains. So I argue and started saying that exactly, coach G calls me a Brat for sticking up for myself?? My friends said I should just let it go, but last year this girl threw a few inches more than me and coach G said ""well she threw further"" even though I'm more consistent. So this feels unfair.

I have severe ADHD and have been struggling to keep it under control with the stress of university, and this can really affect social situations. Around 2 months ago I was added into a groupchat for the people in my class, its a relatively small class at around 20 people and I had been aquainted wth everyone for a while at this point. At the time, I had no idea this was a work only gc and was never made aware of this, I was under the impression that it was more so we could plan social events which there had been talk of. Occasionally (maybe like once every 2/3 days), I would send snaps that are offtopic to work, often making jokes, which would mostly still be on topic to the university (about lecturers etc). My memory is awful so I could be forgetting details here but I'm like 80% sure that was it. Maybe like half the time I'd get a reply (again terrible memory) but generally speaking I wasn't picking up on any objections to this. Looking back though, other people were only doing this if I started it which is something I should have picked up on but I didn't. Around a month after being added, I was removed by the course rep. She told me a few people found my messages distracting, and I was messaging the chat too late (which I was, my sleep schedule is abysmal and sometimes I forget, totally my fault). I immediately apologised and took responsibility. I also told them that I was never warned and made them aware of my ADHD, to serve as an explanation of the behaviour, not an excuse. I was then added back and apologised there, took responsibility and didn't give any explanations. Most of my friends who were in that gc were confused why I got removed but didn't see it as a big enough deal to give it further thought, which fair enough. One of my friends who happened to also have ADHD empathised and told me that i didn't need to apologise and that they were in the wrong for removing me. My GF also didn't think I did anything wrong, but then again she has dealt with my sometimes inappropriate hyperactiveness for 2 years now.

12,1cmsrxh,AITA for refusing to go out and drink with my old friends?,"To preface: I’m probably gonna write a lot, TL;DR will be at the bottom

Yeah so as the title says I(21F) refused to go out drinking with my old friends(20-22M/F)

It’s not just once I’ve refused to go out with them, around 3 months ago that friend group said they wanted to reconnect, we just grew apart, I said “yeah, let’s grab coffee!” But they just wanted to drink.

And it’s not like drinking in a bar, no no no, they still act like teenagers and drink in a forest or a field.

So when they asked this time I refused outright and said “we are at different stages in life” and now they’re making me out to be the bad guy, maybe I am, but that’s up to you to decide.

A year and a half ago I met my fiancé(24M) it was like that whole love at first sight thing, we were dating pretty soon after meeting each other, we shared so many commonalities, we both come from the poverty line, and have experienced a lot together.

11 months ago he started his first job he was proud of, before that it was working in kitchens, supermarkets, fast food places, stuff he hated. 2 months later I took his lead and got a job I was proud of, 3 months later he proposed and we moved in together.

Since then we’ve been growing together, working on things together, building a life together, hell we plan on moving to the US(we’re from Northern Ireland)

You’re probably wondering how this in any way relates to what I’m saying, I don’t really like drinking anymore, neither does he, we’ll share a glass of wine together, or with our close friends and family but it’s never anything huge, it’s just not my lifestyle anymore.

So back to it, I say “we’re at different stages in life” which I acknowledge might seem rude on the surface, but I don’t think it’s entirely untrue, I’m too old to go binge drink, never mind binge drink in a field.

Since me saying that, a lot of my old friends have come out and said I should just do it for old times sake and to stop being a dick about it.

But they’ve come after my fiancé, which I’m not happy about, they’re saying he’s changed me, how I was a completely different person before him and I can tell it’s weighing on him and that hurts to see, that man has helped me become a better person, and pulled me out of a dark dark place, maybe I should have worded myself differently.

So AITA?

(Also I’m posting this before I go to sleep, if I reply, it’ll be in the morning, goodnight)

TL;DR: Old friends want me to go binge drink in a field, I feel I’m too old for that and at a “different stage in life”, they’ve since starting attacking my fiancé, it’s weighing on him, and it’s making me rethink my actions.

14,1cmsizu,AITA for drama at my school?,"post

I’m going to begin this post with a disclaimer:
I’m in high school, it’s really stupid, and it’s very immature.

I’ll start October. There was a guy (17M) that I (17F) liked a LOT (he’s a really manipulative guy). I’ll call him Liam. He was a lot more mature than any of the other people I knew, and I felt like I could talk to him about my life and faith. But he was also the hyper-religious type. This was peak my obsession with making him see me as a person, just begging for him to stop treating me like a little kid.
In October, I had some drama that resulted in me losing a friend. I’ll call him Phillip. Phillip called me crazy when I tried to fix the situation. I apologized for my actions, none of which were harmful to him in any way. So he and I stopped being friends.
Later, I and my friend (17M, Arnold) were wanting to make some music. We were waiting until our other friend could get an instrument, and I began writing.
Well, fast forward to February. There was a girl (17F) who Arnold liked who was friends with me and Phillip (this is important). I’m calling her Penelope. I had known her for a year. She is very insecure. She made it a point to compare us, tell me that guys liked her more, that I’m weird and my style sucks, and always call herself hot (she really isn’t). I never said anything. She always sang, too. Now, I never thought she could sing that well. I’ve never liked her voice, but again, I didn’t say anything. She was also very flaky. She would say she was going to do something, and then “forget” when she was supposed to do it.
In February, I started talking to a guy (18M) who had a “Liam” of his own. She (17F) used to be my friend as well. I’ll call her Lily. That was until I realized she was just as manipulative. She would tell people things that I told her to keep secret, and she would talk behind everyone’s back. She always called this boy, I’ll call him Dean, “hers.” She has friend-zoned him 5 times.
One night, I was on the phone with Arnold and another boy (17M) who Penelope liked. He had a girlfriend. I’ll call him Caden. Penelope was “starting a band” with them, and I got mad because I had written lyrics to a guitar piece that Arnold wrote. So I said two things: that I didn’t think Penelope would go through with it because she already flaked on him once, and that I don’t like Penelope’s voice. I realize it wasn’t fair of me to talk like that, but she has done that to me.
Arnold told Penelope, who then told me that she needed a break from being friends. I thought it would be good for us. Well, she went to talk to Phillip and caused a lot more drama that I don’t have enough characters to tell.
Penelope went out with Lily and told her everything about me and Dean. Lily eventually ended up getting Dean to block me, and it resulted in me losing friends. I also found out Penelope has been lying about me, too.

16,1cms30s,AITA for talking shit about my close friend,"so for background info i am a girl and i have a class friendgroup with about 6 of us. my friend (who we will call C) is probably the most popular girl in our group and she always brings her friends to our class (who im 99.9999% sure dont fuck with me either).

so me and my other friend in our group (who we will call Z) are always being left out. out of plans, out of talks, everything. i'm always alone in the class and no one makes an effort to be around me. they'll all walk afterschool without me, if i walk with them they'll make me walk in the back. if there's gossip they won't tell me. and i'm pretty sure there's a groupchat without me too. they find no problem with this. 

C just recently got a bf (so happy for her) but all she does is talk abt him and its so annoying. she sits w him everyday and doesnt wanna socialize w her friends anymore, she abandons us for her CREEPY, cheating, victimizing son of a bitch bf. 

i remember we had a summative assignment due that day (our class is the last one of the day) and C asked me to go to our school library with MY id to print it. it costs a lot of money to print, and with both of our articles it would be \~50$. naturally i just tell her to go herself and print it herself but she says ""i'll be with my bf and he doesn't let me do anything"". girl this assignment is worth ur grade and ur future, if u fail u won't even pass, but ur SO in love with this ugly boy you abandon your studies? 

my last straw was last friday when we hung out. my mom drove us to a shopping center and i spent a good 60$ on her. this is after i spent 200$ on her alr. when i ask her to pay me back she always has the same excuse (i have no money). and i just then realized that my moms and i's mutual hatred against her was stronger than fucking everrrrr.

today i called my friend from our trio and told her the whole situation (but called her a few cuss words) and she seems really mad that i even mentioned anything. she said she was uncomfortable and didnt think she was the appropriate person. throughout the call she was rly dry nd angry so ofc i was like whatever, then hung up. 

honestly C is just such a horrible friend, she uses me for money and then doesnt let me eat/drink/use any of her stuff. all she talks to me abt is her bf and i just want to tell her i dont care. she uses me for answers, leaves me out of all the plans and is just so rude for no reason. i want to be mature abt this but its so fucking difficult bc ik now we arent meant to be friends anymore. pls tell me if i'm not being rude enough but that BITCHY whore needs to fuck off from my life and she needs to STOP causing messes w me. literally so fucking tired of her bullshit and i wanna drop her but i dont wanna cause more problems in my friendgroup alr after sm drama. 

",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-08,"AITA for talking shit about my close friend so for background info i am a girl and i have a class friendgroup with about 6 of us. my friend (who we will call C) is probably the most popular girl in our group and she always brings her friends to our class (who im 99.9999% sure dont fuck with me either).

so me and my other friend in our group (who we will call Z) are always being left out. out of plans, out of talks, everything. i'm always alone in the class and no one makes an effort to be around me. they'll all walk afterschool without me, if i walk with them they'll make me walk in the back. if there's gossip they won't tell me. and i'm pretty sure there's a groupchat without me too. they find no problem with this. 

C just recently got a bf (so happy for her) but all she does is talk abt him and its so annoying. she sits w him everyday and doesnt wanna socialize w her friends anymore, she abandons us for her CREEPY, cheating, victimizing son of a bitch bf. 

i remember we had a summative assignment due that day (our class is the last one of the day) and C asked me to go to our school library with MY id to print it. it costs a lot of money to print, and with both of our articles it would be \~50$. naturally i just tell her to go herself and print it herself but she says ""i'll be with my bf and he doesn't let me do anything"". girl this assignment is worth ur grade and ur future, if u fail u won't even pass, but ur SO in love with this ugly boy you abandon your studies? 

my last straw was last friday when we hung out. my mom drove us to a shopping center and i spent a good 60$ on her. this is after i spent 200$ on her alr. when i ask her to pay me back she always has the same excuse (i have no money). and i just then realized that my moms and i's mutual hatred against her was stronger than fucking everrrrr.

He constantly insinuates fights with people, including me, even when they aren’t an issue. A few weeks ago, he ranted about his SO in the general of a discord server but he worded it in such a way that it sounded like a joke. I responded with a joke and the next morning he had responded w/ “no one likes you so shut up” and i found this odd but i didn’t say anything. Someone else in the server had responded to him however saying that i was just joking. He responded back saying that he was joking as well. By this point, i stepped in and told him that the way he worded his first message made me think it was a joke and he proceeded to scold me on how he was mad about it since he had been crying all night about his SO (he didn’t ever specify that he was crying.) I never wanted a fight but he kicked someone out of the server because they were trying to reason w/ him and he was acting weird. His SO eventually got on to basically dismiss anything about the situation at all. K refused to apologize, even after i did, saying that he wasn’t gonna apologize for his feelings and saying “i’ve had a rough couple of weeks” as an excuse for his actions. The other day, K got mad at me for trying to calm down a situation that i didn’t want escalating. Someone (obviously K) vented through an anonymous messaging bot and someone else responded to K, who got mad and immediately threatened to ban. I intervened and said to calm down, to which K responded rather rudely, i tried to explain that maybe they could give a lighter warning before immediately going for a ban as the person had only done it once, and K later scolded me for trying to “override his authority.” I only said anything in the first place because one of the members, who is rather sensitive to things such as fights, we’ll call them O, was returning from a break for a while and i just wanted to stop the situation before the other person had time to respond. O thankfully didn’t witness literal hell about to break loose, but i explained it to him anyways and warned that K was rather..uptight about others opinions that don’t align perfectly with his and will sometimes call others name when they try to reason w/ him. I’m genuinely starting to hate how K acts, and w/ his SO constantly on his side there’s no point in trying to argue with him anymore on the fact that how he acts it unreasonable and negatively affected others.

18,1cmrvlv,AITA for telling my roommate to stop yelling at her cat?,"I (19m) have a roommate (20f) that lives with me and my fiancé. Some context: We both have cats. My fiancé and I handle the treatment of our cat VERY differently than our roommate handles hers. My cat, let’s call her, Bella, is a tabby mix and very loving. We are very careful to not overwhelm her and shower her with lots of affection and playtime. My roommates cat, Mary, gets probably the exact opposite from our roommate. I still try to treat Mary the same way I do Bella, but Mary isn’t very responsive to it. 

When Bella gets into things or acts up, I just take her out of the situation. Like recently, she was playing with a charger, so I just took away the charger and put it out of reach. However, if Mary were to do that, my roommate yells at her and claps loudly or rushes over to the cat, causing her to run away. Mary is very skittish due to my roommate’s behaviour. 

I have tried to kindly approach the subject and originally just decided, we just do things differently. Recently however the yelling has escalated to everytime Mary does something my roommate doesn’t like. The biggest one is when the cat grooms herself. As long as it’s her paws or back it’s fine. But the minute Mary begins to groom her hind legs or genitals, my roommate yells at her, saying for her to stop licking her p*ssy. I don’t understand why! I have repeatedly educated my roommate that she isn’t doing something inappropriate or sexual, which is how my roommate responds to the situation. 

A week ago, after Mary was yelled at for grooming her genitals when a friend was over, I lost it. I asked my roommate to privately speak with me after the friend left. I told her that I thought her treatment of her cat was cruel and unnecessary. She got very mad and said that it’s her cat, not mine, and she can discipline her however my roommate wants. I told her that her “discipline” won’t teach her cat anything and causes Mary way too much stress and anxiety. 

Since then, my roommate has been complaining about me to my fiancé accusing me of being a bad friend that doesn’t respect her. She is refusing to speak to me, and her behaviour towards her cat is getting worse. This has been very upsetting because my roommate has been a very close friend of me and my fiancé (which is why we signed a lease with her in the first place).

I 43f have a daughter Kendra (fake name) who’s 15. My daughter for the last year ish has been hugely obsessed with celebrities like Taylor Swift. It’s become a vocal point in her life to talk about TS’s music or Easter eggs (I think that’s correct).  Honestly I don’t see anything wrong with this,maybe a little concern over how much she knows, but nothing that raises red flags. I’m happy knowing that this is what occupies her time instead of something truly worrying. I’m heavily emphasizing this because a year ago my baby girl was so depressed she couldn’t get out of bed. 

Now the issue at hand is when I was growing up my mother would never allow us to over obsess anything. It’s hard to describe but most of my childhood rules were sit, be quiet, and obey. I’ve limited my contact with my mom due to this stifling but I’ve let her back in. This past weekend my family (including my mom) were sitting and watching TV. Taylor S briefly popped up on the screen and Kendra began talking to her brother about it (also a casual fan). No one was paying attention until my
Mom asked Kendra “When are you gonna grow up?” I snapped at her to leave it but she kept telling Kendra that she was sick and tired of hearing about Taylor. I got defensive saying Kendra hadn’t brought her up this entire time nor had she the last few visits. We kept going back and forth and I asked my kids to leave the room.

My mom brought up the fact that Kendra posts frequently about TS on her insta and I finally snapped saying I don’t mind because at least she feels like she can without judgement. I kept yelling about the fact that I was never able to talk about my interest or hobbies growing up ,so I don’t care if she Kendra gets TS on her forehead if it makes her happy.

23,1cmr7yv,AITA for not giving my daughters ss number to her grandparents,"Aita for not giving my daughters social to her grandparents?? So alittle back story my husband(26) and I(f25) have certain rules when it comes to our daughter. Like people have to respect both parents to see our child or people have to attempt to be involved. I had my daughter in September 2023. Ever sense her “grandparents” from my husbands side has been MIA. We live 15 min from them lol. My baby had severe colic and stomach issues and they had an excuse everytime I asked for help or asked if they could come over so I could shower to watch her. I begged and begged. I also asked to come over to their house so they could see their grand baby and it was a no, and i also volunteered to meet them at a restaurant and pay for my own if they could see their grandkid and it was a no. So as of January 12th 2024 I made a rule where I’m not gonna beg people to see my child so they haven’t seen my child at all.  They are lousy. 

Anyway, yesterday my husband received a text from his mom asking for my daughter’s social security number because they wanna open a college savings for her. But my husband and I don’t feel comfortable giving that information out, mostly my husbands step dad who has no job and gambling problem. The first thing that went through my mind was “he’s gonna get a credit in her name”. Anyway so we told them sorry no. And that made them angry and now one of the grandparents aka my husbands step dad. Blocked us on Facebook and blocked my mom on Facebook. So aita for saying no? Or should I have let them. 

Edit: sense people are getting confused. No I don’t ask them to baby sit I don’t let anyone babysit my kid. Also I don’t have family in this state so I wanted them to have a relationship with my child so she has family that live close but I should have known if the mother wasn’t there for her own kids and left them to fend for themselves then she ain’t gonna be a grandparent. 
Also we have a college fund for our baby already going they could easily contribute but with the step dads (grandparent) background I don’t trust them to have her social. 
If y’all met these people you would understand but you can only go off what I say. Also my husband has tried to take her over to see them and it’s an excuse everytime. They do the same to their other grandchild that my husband sister has. So they hate both kids and grandkids equally I guess.
Also with the stepdad (grandparent) back ground, I don’t trust my daughters social to be in some random hands. And the step dad and the mom has only been together for 7 years. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-08,"AITA for not giving my daughters ss number to her grandparents Aita for not giving my daughters social to her grandparents?? So alittle back story my husband(26) and I(f25) have certain rules when it comes to our daughter. Like people have to respect both parents to see our child or people have to attempt to be involved. I had my daughter in September 2023. Ever sense her “grandparents” from my husbands side has been MIA. We live 15 min from them lol. My baby had severe colic and stomach issues and they had an excuse everytime I asked for help or asked if they could come over so I could shower to watch her. I begged and begged. I also asked to come over to their house so they could see their grand baby and it was a no, and i also volunteered to meet them at a restaurant and pay for my own if they could see their grandkid and it was a no. So as of January 12th 2024 I made a rule where I’m not gonna beg people to see my child so they haven’t seen my child at all.  They are lousy. 

Anyway, yesterday my husband received a text from his mom asking for my daughter’s social security number because they wanna open a college savings for her. But my husband and I don’t feel comfortable giving that information out, mostly my husbands step dad who has no job and gambling problem. The first thing that went through my mind was “he’s gonna get a credit in her name”. Anyway so we told them sorry no. And that made them angry and now one of the grandparents aka my husbands step dad. Blocked us on Facebook and blocked my mom on Facebook. So aita for saying no? Or should I have let them.

Unfortunately, we found out soon after that he couldn't get the days for the convention off, so I had asked his mother {42\] (who I'm close with) if she would like to come with me. She agreed and for the next 2 months we just went about our days.

I asked her a week in advance if she still wanted to go, to which she replied yes. So I figured we were good to go and I was prepared for the weekend. The day before the convention she calls me Thursday to let me know she is still coming. She further elaborates on her calling me to tell me she understands that I've had people make false promises and have plans fall through the day beforehand as well as have been disappointed lots by these promises most of my life. 

I thought this was a bit odd, but listened. We had a nice conversation after and then went about our day. She then texts me Friday saying she's going to drop her kid off instead because she has depression and burnout. Not to mention she was apparently in a financial struggle so she couldn't afford to go or pay for this childs transit for the weekend either.

I was mad, but scared of confrontation and tried to make the most of the situation. It wasnt the kids fault, and my boyfriend hadn't seen his brother in a while. So I agreed to this, but then she told me after she would pick him up monday. I then texted her and let her know that she had upset me and that I didnt like how she dropped her kid off on me last second, then lied to me about her finances as she had her boyfriend come over and spent 200 dollars on food and what not. I gave her money for gas and the like as well so this hurt me. 

Well, we sorted it out and I began to try and make Mothers Day Plans when she abruptly ends the call and then I get a text from her 16 yr old son saying that she and her boyfriend started talking about me.

So I sent her another text, and told her that if she had an issue with the way I confronted her then that should be a conversation that we should have instead of me hearing about it after the fact.

27,1cniqm5,AITA for getting away from my friends?,"Hello, this is my first post, I'm sorry if my English is bad, it's not my native language, I'll try to do the best I can.

I'm 18 years old and I know it may seem silly but it's something that continues to run through my mind every second. I have two friends, Sam and Eli, I feel somewhat excluded from them but to understand this I know you will need some context.

Sam and I grew up together, we are almost like sisters, we always support each other and try to be very close. I always adored her. This changed a few years ago, Sam and her family were looking for a better life for her and moved out of the country. I felt very sad but I knew it was for the best, I tried to give her the most beautiful and memorable farewell as well as promising that we would keep in touch. She is a very sociable being and she met another girl, Eli, they became friends and Sam introduced us. We spent entire afternoons playing Fortnite and talking.

A few months ago Sam and Eli have gradually distanced themselves from me, sometimes they no longer ask me to play and Sam no longer writes to me privately to tell me things about her. Eli sometimes talks to me but she has her own problems and sometimes she isolates herself from everyone and I know it's not something against me. I feel alone and excluded. A few months ago I finished high school and I'm home until college starts. Sometimes I just want to play with them and chat, but it's hard.

I tried to bring more games so we can play online, but Sam doesn't like them and he doesn't want to play them. If I try to write to Sam we can only start a superficial conversation, while Eli already knows how I feel but I get an apology and then I go back to no contact even if it is for weeks.

I understand that Sam has her new life but I feel more and more outside of it, Sam and Eli see each other almost every day and play at her house, do their homework, eat and watch movies. I feel like a third wheel. It hurts me that I can't do any of this since I'm literally on the other side of the world, I'm saving up to visit them but no one has shown interest in coming to see me. I don't have friends here because I was a person who was always studying and my mother didn't let me go out. Eli sometimes plays with me and is on a call but I feel hurt and that feeling only gets worse every time I see them both online playing or chatting, being on a call for hours just the two of them.

A week ago I went back to tell what I felt and that I was seriously reconsidering my friendship with them. Eli had a little meltdown and tried to do the same by explaining to me that they were busy and stuff, but I just ignored her. I didn't try to contact them and just distance myself little by little. Sam told me that I'm exaggerating and that she has a lot of important things to do about this.

Back when I was in my twenties our great grandmother ended up with an illness which required someone to take care of her. This ended up being me as everyone else was busy with their lives and I have only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to this when she passed away I have inherited the house she lived in, which is a small 2 bedroom. I have lived there until I got married and me and my husband ended up moving to a bigger property. About a year later my brother asked if I'm willing to rent it out to him, which I agreed to do, but have warned him I will need it back when Caroline turns 18 (She was 3 at the time) since it is very close to universities and city center. Legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so everything was followed by the book.

About a year ago I have informed my brother about needing the house back as my daughter is going to be 18 and I would like to have some repairs done before she moves in. My brother ignored me, so I have issued him notice to vacate, which was also ignored. As he continued to ignore me, I had no choice but apply for a court order to evict them, with hearing taking place last month. Last week him and his family were officially evicted.

Our in law’s have purchased a new/ old house. It’s a beautiful master craftsman, but like a lot of old houses does not have central air. My wife and I will be renting their previous house and possibly buying it come next year. The house is amazing and the only thing is my wife’s grandmother will be living with us as she gets too hot and lives with our in-law’s. So here the AITA portion.

My wife has an uncle who has been in-out of jail and prison basically his entire adult life( he is 51). Last time was for possession and distribution of a controlled substance. He got out last year and is in the mid-west doing whatever (he says he can’t work because he gets stomach aches, however none of the tests including a colonoscopy found anything). My wife’s grandma would like him to move into our home so he’s close with family and she can be with him. She asked my wife about this and my wife said she would think about this but did not feel comfortable with that. 

More background
It became known to me that this man also stole his dying father’s pain pills while his father was going through chemo. And ran up a bar tab in his fathers name in the amount of several thousand in a mining town that his father was well known in (due to being a manager at the mine)

I am completely against the dude moving in, not comfortable at all with it and neither is my wife. 

We broke the news to her grandma that it’s a no and she broke down crying saying she already told him it’s okay to move in. She’s upset that we show no compassion and only see him as a felon.

Background: My roommate has always been a bit messy and disorganized, but I didn't mind it too much at first. However, over time, his messiness has escalated to the point where it's affecting my quality of life. He leaves dirty dishes in the sink for days, never takes out the trash, and lets his belongings clutter up the common areas.

I've tried talking to him about it multiple times, but he always brushes it off or promises to do better without actually following through. It's gotten to the point where I dread coming home because I never know what kind of mess I'll find.

Recently, I reached my breaking point when I found out that he had been using my things without asking and even damaged some of them in the process. When I confronted him about it, he was dismissive and didn't seem to understand why I was upset.

Feeling frustrated and fed up, I finally sat him down and told him that I think it's best if he finds somewhere else to live. I tried to be as diplomatic as possible, explaining that our living styles just aren't compatible and that I need a living situation where I feel respected and comfortable.

For some reason he didn't take it well at all. He accused me of being unfair and said that I was overreacting to a few minor issues. He's been telling our mutual friends that I'm kicking him out for no reason and making me out to be the bad guy.

Now I'm questioning whether I handled the situation correctly. Am I the Asshole for kicking my roommate out, or was it a necessary step to preserve my sanity and well-being?

When I brought it up, she not only didn’t apologize, but asked if I could take care of it.

Regarding the food, she left 3 full pantry shelves of food and said “I thought I cleaned it up” when she clearly didn’t. We had problems with her in the past for not taking responsibility for her own dishes and spills (and also saying she “thought she cleaned it” when she spilled my other roommates wine all over the floor and just left it there for 12 hours). She clearly did not feel remorse that I had to clean up after her until I sent pictures of what she did, because she kept saying excuses that didn’t make sense and lying until a picture proved her wrong. Once I articulated how unfair this was for me, she sent me $200.

It felt just at first, but I'm starting to feel bad taking the money. Tbh I've been eating the food she left behind since it was going to go to waste anyways. I also listed the appliances she left behind online, since pickup would be the only way to get rid of them. Who knows if I'll actually be able to sell them, but if I can, I kinda feel bad taking the money. On the other hand though, she left me all this stuff to deal with so maybe I am owed money?

32,1cnhqs4,AITA for removing my mom from my toll account?,"I (23m) had opened up a toll account a few years ago as I had just bought my first car and planned to drive after my lessons. My single mother (42f) proposed to add her car as she currently has toll debts on her own account and would be cheaper than paying of her debt; in exchange she would help me complete my remaining learner driver hours. 

Fast forward year to now and my mom never followed through; on top of this we also had a falling out resulting in me getting kicked out and living on my own making it near impossible to save. I was only lucky that I have a full time admin job in a small finance company but rental costs are ridiculous. 

We eventually made amends and now I'm back living with her while paying for myself (half rent,utilities, own groceries and public transport). She also works so we're both doing alright financially.

I've come to realise not much has changed and I'm at the point where I'm planning remove any ties that she's relying on me for so I can move out shortly with some good friends of mine.

This means closing this toll account that she's linked to which means she will need to cover her debts. In my country they just charge the tolls to the registered vehicle owner if they're aren't linked to an account in the system so in this case there's no major repercussions.

If there was a better option I'd take it but it's really holding me back from living my life seperate from my mother and talking to her about this will only end in an argument or a lecture.

33,1cnhi4x,AITA for not getting my daughter anything for her birthday?,"My daughter turned 13 yesterday. I made sure to ask her what she wants for her birthday a few months in advance. She gave me a list. Great. I explained she won't be getting everything from the list as it was big and some things were expensive. She understood.

About a week after we had that conversation, she tells me she wants tickets to a show for her birthday. Going to the show would also mean traveling a little out of the city. Neither are cheap. So I told her that would be the only gift she would get and would also replace a party. She said that's what she wants and I triple checked before I booked tickets.

A couple of weeks ago, would you believe, she tells me she changed her mind again. She wants clothes instead of the show. I told her I already booked everything so there's absolutely no way. She got into a strop about it and said she isn't going. I told her fine I'll take someone else, fully expecting her to later apologize and say she is coming.

But the apology never came. In fact her attitude got worse and she got into trouble at school. She asked me if I got her the clothes and I told her no, I'm sticking to my word. I don't think she believed me. Well her birthday came and she realized I wasn't bluffing. I didn't get her any gifts. She was appalled and I was the worst mother ever. I told her she's learned a valuable lesson. I really wanted to make her birthday special but she was being awful. Of course other relatives got her things but none from me.

She told her grandparents her side of the story. Which was of course all one sided making her out as a victim. They called me and I explained to them the whole truth. They also think I'm awful and the ""poor girl"" needs gifts from her mother. I told them next year will be different if she behaves.

I (16M) live with my mom and her boyfriend lives with us as well, my dad has no custody of me. Me and my dad have a good relationship, we text and sometimes call. Mom's boyfriend is not fond of my dad in the slightest, though I'm not exactly sure why. 


Recently, I was outside with my mom and her boyfriend while they were doing work on their cars. My mom mentioned how the landlord was going to send a handyman over to fix the faucet in our bathtub. Mom's boyfriend said he (handyman) was quitting soon. Mom made a comment about how the landlord will send an ""even shittier"" handyman next time as the people our landlord hires have historically been pretty bad at their jobs.

I made a joke saying, ""Ha, He should hire dad!"" My dad has worked as a carpenter for around 28-ish years, he has experience fixing many things around the house and even working on cars. He's come by in the past few months and fixed our kitchen sink and replaced the faucet and spray nozzle. I made this joke because well, my dad’s experience, I guess. I connected “good handyman” = “my dad.” It was 100% meant as a joke. I thought “Why would our landlord hire my dad? My dad already has a job, and I doubt he would ever want to work for our landlord anyway. Also, that probably crosses some weird employement lines, it would feel really strange if our landlord hired my dad. Obviously, I’m joking!” I thought what I said would be well-received, but still very obviously a joke.

Apparently, I'm not a very funny person. Mom's boyfriend goes visibly upset and makes this noise, then walks away back to his car for a few minutes.

Mom turns to me and goes, ""Don't say those things around him.""

I go, ""I don't care, he's my dad.""

Mom says, ""It's not hard for you to be considerate.""

I shrugged and responded, ""It's not hard for him to be considerate either."" Then I walk away and head back inside.

I did feel like a bit of an asshole after this, but also I feel like it’s not too hard to accept the fact that I have a father and I will talk about him. I feel like he doesn’t like my dad being mentioned because he had a past relationship with my mom.

When I finished high school, I enrolled into a local college, and honestly it didn't make much sense to move on campus as living home allowed me to save money. So I continued to live home. Grandma's money also helped cover my tuition, and I have a YouTube channel that generates some income, so I can cover my living expenses and have some left. However, my parents are not happy that I continue to live at home and yet refuse to obey their ""home"" rules, like curfew, or how much time I spend playing videogames (even though videogames actually generate my income), or that I don't come upstairs to join them for the meals, and instead cook my own in the kitchenette downstairs.

So they tried to pull the ""our home, our rules, either you pay rent or get out"" spiel, and I pointed out that it's as much MY house as it's my mother's, and whatever rent they charge me, I can charge my father as he isn't on the house deed.

39,1cnfaae,WIBTA if I put a lock on the laundry room door in my shared roommate house ,"*** thank you for everyone who shared about the locks that exist for the w/d only!! ***


Edit to add up top: the washer/dryer was not provided to us by a rental company, never in ten years has one ever been provided for me as a renter, I bought this set for $1200 and both roommates said “sorry can’t help”


Info/long story short:  I do not own this house, l've just lived here for 4 years and have had a few changing roommates. No one contributes to big ticket items and I’m done sharing my things and not having split help in a split home. A roommate doesn’t want to buy a lawn tool after I’ve been the one to buy and find everything else. If I have to do it, I am locking the laundry door and cutting off access to its use, another $1200 ticket that no one else contributed 

Please know I also bought a $500 used set about 4 months prior that ended up breaking quickly and I was fed up with cheap stuff bc I had only had the last cheap set before that about a year plus some change. No, no one helped with the $500 buy either (same roommates)

Other than the first year in this particular home with two other people (who moved in with partners after year 1), this has been a common theme where I have to take charge *because no one else will* in all the ways of deep cleaning and supplying. 

I've always been OK enough with money so l never cared much but at 33 and with all the wild financial changes that's happened the last few years, I don't feel confident with my financial future anymore and I'm done with people hanging onto my (frankly tattered) coattails.

I shared around February to the current roommate who was staying for a 2nd year that we still need a weed whacker and could he grab one before the season begins. I have supplied every other tool and accessory a home needs. He says something about his uncle coming by to do it, which seems like a nuisance to me but 
w/e lol not my uncle or task to ask. And that would be fine except he just weed whacks down the flowers in front (???) and around the mailbox. He doesn't go in the back yard or do nearly all what we need that tool for?

So l pointed that out, and shared quite vulnerably that I owed 4k in taxes this year and that l'd really love it for the house to have one so that *everything* can get done, and that if he’s staying another year him contributing needs to start bc I am genuinely spent. I have a cool tone, l'm not barreling down on him, but he reacted BAD.

Says I don't do anything inside or outside (lie), and just generally pulled a fit because I basically said ""I can't do this alone and I need you to contribute and this is now a hard boundary line"". Suddenly now I have all these issues he’s had to deal with 🙄 

INFO: Because he had no problem not contributing to the w/d I had to buy for $1200, that came out of my savings / taxes fund which is why some of taxes had to go on my CC in the first place this year. And it’s why I feel stretched thin right now. IM JUST DONE SHARING MY STUFF when no one contributes to buying of any other big ticket items 

Just so everyone knows, he does buy the paper towels … that I don’t use bc I use hand towels 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

So AITA if I put a lock on the laundry room door? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-08,"WIBTA if I put a lock on the laundry room door in my shared roommate house  *** thank you for everyone who shared about the locks that exist for the w/d only!! ***


Edit to add up top: the washer/dryer was not provided to us by a rental company, never in ten years has one ever been provided for me as a renter, I bought this set for $1200 and both roommates said “sorry can’t help”


Info/long story short:  I do not own this house, l've just lived here for 4 years and have had a few changing roommates. No one contributes to big ticket items and I’m done sharing my things and not having split help in a split home.

A while ago on fandom, a user we'll call Gin, harassed me and others and vandalized pages. They told multiple people to die and even sent me jew insults (I'm jewish). They are some UTTP member, so this seemed like the usual UTTP fuss. As any normal human would do, I reported it to fandom, and since I'm one of the wiki bureaus, I handled their bans and undid the vandalism. That's just the tip of the iceberg, but I don't wanna explain every shitty thing they did. They are a terrible person.

A couple days ago, Gin contacted me again acting like an old friend and denying everything before pulling out the stupidest antisemetic jokes ever, so I blocked them and deleted the chat. Yesterday, someone contacted me on a random acc showing my house, mentioning my parents, and my town, doxxing me. I blocked them yet again, but deleted the messages (which stupid move from me I know). My friends and parents think it's someone from my school, but I'm pretty sure its Gin.

I mentioned it to my parents, and they were super mad, not at the user really but at me. They think I was being aggressive and as such, it's my fault I was doxxed. My mom specifically said she's scared someone will turn up at our house, but it's not like it was made public AND it's probably some stupid kid doing this out of spite. They said I should have left the vandalism on the wiki alone because it's ""not my job"" then told me to give up my bureau on the wiki when I said it is my job BECAUSE I literally help regulate the wiki. I refused, which made them even madder. They wanna go to the police but don't have enough evidence rn since I deleted the messages. We had a whole fight over this, and now my insta suspended from probably getting spam reporting, my parents not letting me on it anymore until I get my phone back. I'm just spooked that this was all put on me. They acted like I would be calm abt it and got mad that I was mad abt it.

Thomas and heather broke up and Thomas got really distant with us and only came around when he needed something. Fast forward to sept 2023 we let heather move in with us as she was on the verge of homelessness due to her father being a raging alcoholic.

She’s been very disrespectful to me for months now and my husband told her a few weeks ago that it’s her last chance. She’s been acting better for the most part but she’s now pregnant and I don’t want her here. I told my husband and he said I need to clear the slate and give her a chance. It’s not even that she’s being disrespectful anymore im just done. I’ve had enough and I don’t trust that her being nice is going to last. He gets mad any time I talk about throwing her out.

42,1cneukb,AITA for leaving my friends on their birthday to see my boyfriend?,"I have been friends with my friend and his wife for over twenty years. I regularly visit them on weekends and bank holidays to hangout, play MtG and video games as well as go walks and to the park with the kids etc (their kids) 

On their birthdays I always go down to see them and we hang out as always and I stay the night (I live 30 miles away) sometimes the weekend. I try to put thought and effort into their gifts but money has been tight and all I could afford was some perfume (£30)

On this occasion I had gone down as normal spent around four hours with them hanging out as normal having a good time. It got to a point where we were all getting hungry and both my friends started making dinner for themselves and the kids. I left them to it but honestly felt a bit put out by not being offered any food. I asked what we had planned for the night and the response was to just watch tv. 

This is where I’m pretty sure I was wrong. I mentioned that seeing as my boyfriend lives a couple of miles down the road I might go see him for a bit while they ate, planning on coming back. However before I could finish my sentence my friends wife began loudly exclaiming that I’m ditching them. Despite my objections she began screaming that I’m a horrible friend, who will do anything to get laid and that I never cared about them. At this point I’m pissed, I don’t bother trying to explain what I had intended. As birthday or not I refuse to be spoken to that way. 

As I’m packing my things she continues to scream while my friend stands in the corner quietly (In hindsight I know he won’t side against his wife but it still hurt) She begins saying how I bailed on them on my friends birthday too because I was “ill”. 

For context I had entered us both in a MtG competition and paid the entry fee, which he was aware of and backed out at the last minute because he couldn’t use the cards he wanted. I still went (again probably the asshole) and progressively felt worse having to go home, nearly passing out whilst driving resulting in my mum collecting me where I crashed in her sofa for five days (turns out it was tonsillitis)

She again accused me of not being there for them and ditching them for a boy (I’d been dating for a few months) screaming at me in the streets as well as I got in the car. 

For additional context I’ve always gone to see them never the other way around. I always offer to help them out with anything they need including picking up the kids, hospital trips, giving lifts (in a car, yes she drives too) I feel like I’ve been a good friend to them as much as I possibly could and to have a moment where I wanted to see my boyfriend thrown in my face along with a tirade of abuse hurt me.

Usually, whenever I want to smoke, I'll come out to the corridor to do so because my daughter has asthma since childhood. As I live in the flat that's right at the corner of the floor, I'll smoke in the direction facing away from my next-door neighbor's flat so that the smoke doesn't affect them as much as possible.

Recently, my neighbor confronted me while I was smoking and complained that I was setting a bad example for their children, saying that ""seeing a shirtless man with lots of tattoos smoking everyday can negatively influence"" their children (they're referring to me here as I always smoke shirtless and have tattoos on my upper body). They then told me to stop smoking along the corridor because of this.

I find their request rather dumb for multiple reasons. Firstly, shouldn't it be their duty as parents to raise their children the way they want and not let them be influenced by other people's actions. Secondly, if their request was due to my smoke giving them breathing difficulties or whatnot, I would gladly oblige to the request, but in this case, the reasoning behind their request is entirely different. Thirdly, it's not illegal for me to be doing this.

3 months later I found myself not having fun with the game anymore so I decided to quit too, but figured I could make some money out of the game before quitting and sold all the in game currency for about $700 and quit the game.

My intention was to share the money with them but everyone refused and said it was ok to keep them. Everyone but one friend who was pissed at me for selling all the items and gold. I offered him part of the money, about $250, but he kept saying I shouldn’t have sold the gold and refused them.

My intention was to share the money with them but everyone refused and said it was ok to keep them. Everyone but one friend who was pissed at me for selling all the items and gold. I offered him part of the money, about $250, but he kept saying I shouldn’t have sold the gold and refused them.

47,1cnd7tu,WIBTA if I went to a Mother's Day party with my step-daughter? ,"Hi everyone, 

I (34F) have two of my own kids and two bonus kids. (11M and 8F). I have been with their dad for almost 6 years and we live together. My step kids are with us about 30% of the time. Overall, we all have a really strong relationship and I love them very much. Our house is happy. 

Currently, we are working through trying to get more custody of my step kids. Their mother is truly not a nice woman and has escalated this situation to full on court. It was her decision to end their marriage and I truly don't think she thought it through- meaning that I don't think she thought he would fall in love and her kids would have another extended family that they'd love. My stepdaugther specifically has been very upset the past few months. She hasn't been herself and last weekend had a total meltdown. She said her mom has been saying that our house is not a real home, and that she should only live in one place. A few days ago, my stepdaughter told me that she feels like I'm her real mom and that she wants me to go to her mother's day party at school. I can, logistically, make it there, but I'm worried that it's the wrong call and will cause further conflict with her mom. I can imagine that since her mom is already saying negative things about us, that this will cause further negative comments to my stepdaughter or a full blown fight with her mom and my current partner.

49,1cncuoi,AITA giving daughter money every month?,"Need a third party perspective on this. Most of my family and my wife are telling me to stop. I can’t tell if my judgement is clouded because she’s my daughter.

I’m married to Lisa (53F). We have a daughter together, Ange (24F). She’s our only daughter. I’m quite well off now but when I was younger, I grew up poor. My wife has always been more upper class and had extremely wealthy parents.

Raising Ange, we tried our best to make sure she lived comfortably while also teaching her the value of money. She got a part time job through high school and college. We made her save it all and gave her an allowance out of our own pockets. We assumed Ange would do well in uni with budgeting and as a leaving gift, we decided to pay her rent so she could focus on her studies. She did do that, graduated with a 1st class in engineering but she also took on a lot of debts. About 6K worth in overdraft fees which stopped becoming interest free last year. The job market seemed to be brutal for graduates her age so she never got a job in engineering. Instead Ange now works in a cafe making a little more than minimum wage and does extra side jobs too.

Ange lives with us. As a condition of her staying, she pays rent (Lisa’s idea, I disagree because we have more than enough money to let Ange stay rent free to build up her overdraft payments) and my wife sits down with her monthly to draft a financial month plan. Ange has to show her the statements on her card and they go from there. I’m not part of these meetings between them because my wife thinks I’m not tough enough on the issue of Ange getting out of debt. I’d say I am, just not as militant as my wife is - I can hear her raise her voice at Lisa sometimes. I grew up poor, I know how important it is to get out of debt before it spirals because I too was in debt for a period of my life.

This what we are arguing about. Ange broke down to me a few months ago that she feels the monthly meeting are humiliating and condescending. They make her feel bad about going to see friends because Lisa will get angry. So, I agreed with her that I would send her a small amount of money (£300 a month) for her own leisure use as long as she commits to using her whole salary outside of essentials like travel and the rent to pay off her debts. Obviously Lisa would have seen me sending the money so I got her a Monzo card.

For the past few months, everything was going well. Lisa could see Ange taking her debt seriously and Ange can enjoy herself a little bit within reason. She has not asked me for anymore money. A couple weeks ago, Ange screwed up and sent her main bank account some money that she owed a friend which is where Lisa caught on and I had to explain myself. She was beyond angry and said I betrayed her and undermined our partnership. I told her I was never onboard with this system in the first place and my idea helps Lisa learn the value of money.

51,1cnck89,AITA for talking about my feelings with one of my friends?,"I wasn’t sure how to word the title for this post. I (21F) had gotten into a fight with a friend (21F) about 2ish weeks ago. She had invited me and my roommate (20M) over for dinner one night. My roommate and I both said we had homework to do but we could do it over at her place, I had also stated I was more than happy to bake something since she was cooking. She was asking me pretty much all day the day she had invited me and my roommate over if I was still coming over because “saying you have homework doesn’t mean you can come over and you can’t hang out” - her words. Yet, my roommate would hang out at her place at least two days a week and vice versa with her. So day of her inviting us over, I told her that I felt unwelcome but I hope they (her, my roommate and her roommate) had a fun time. My roommate had rushed in and out and barely said anything other than “I’m heading over to her house.” He usually talks to me for about 5 mins before he leaves to go anywhere so I added on to my texts to my friend saying “especially with how he [roommate] rushed out when we usually catch up for a few before he leaves.” She responds within 5 minutes saying “WTF. Idk where you got this mentality from but it’s not true and you’re being dramatic. I was just about to tell you he got here. I was dealing with a potential house fire.” after every period it was a new text message). So I replied “I’m sorry you were dealing with that but you’re ignoring what I stated about feeling unwelcome and now I feel even more unwelcome.” She continued to attack me saying that I was being passive aggressive/aggressive when I wasn’t and she said twice that I was attacking her and both times I told her I wasn’t trying to attack her and I’m sorry for making it seem like I was attacking her. The end of the convo was her saying “We’re talking in circles and I don’t want to talk about it anymore because you’re not listening. You’re being really irrational right now. I hope you feel better” and then I removed her on everything but her number cause in my mind I was like “if she wants dramatic and irrational, i’ll give her that”

A week later (so last week), I sent her like 2-3 reels on insta and she didn’t respond to any of them. A little later in the week, there was a picnic thing for her major and one of my friends (23F) went (she was invited by one of her other friends) and I couldn’t go cause I had plans to go home. Friend 2 texted me saying she saw friend 1 and was like “omg I saw her at the picnic and she was like ‘you’re an anth major? you probably know my friend (me) and I think she’s mad at me right now”. Friend 2 said we just started hanging out, which isn’t a complete lie

Fast foward again, my birthday was this last sunday (5/5) and friend 1 didn’t text me happy birthday despite her trying to make plans with me for my birthday but i kept saying no since i made plans with friend 2 and some other of my friends for my birthday 

AITA? Should I apologize to friend 1?

EDIT: I guess for more clarification, it was my finals week when she had invited me over for dinner so I was swamped with homework but I had also stated I was MORE than happy to go over and do homework there while everyone hangs out. She had asked me about 2-3 days before the date planned for dinner because she knows I need a few days in advance before I hang out and she knew it was my finals week but still, I said I was more than happy to go over to hang out.

52,1cncjdj,AITA For confronting a neighbor about his dog running around without a leash,"My parents recently bought their retirement home on a lake in a rural area.  I (36F) have been heading up there on weekends to help them get settled in.  They are both very excited to enjoy their retirement, but they have some complaints about living in their new place.  They have lived in a metro area their entire lives so there are some adjustments they will need to make.  Mostly small things like further drives for shopping and lack of restaurant options.  But their biggest gripe is how their neighbors let their dogs run around wherever they want.  

It seems that no one on their lakeshore leashes their dogs.  And almost everyone else that lives up there either has a dog or have relatives that bring theirs up there.  No one has fences so the dogs are just running around from yard to yard.  My parents have been complaining about it to me but as far as I know they haven't said anything to their neighbors about it yet.  

This past weekend I was up there helping with some yard work and saw firsthand how people let their dogs run around.  There was a guy a few houses down from my parents that was working in his yard too and had his dog running around outside with him.  The dog never came into my parent's yard, but it did go into the neighbor's directly next to them.  I never once heard the guy call his dog back to him, he just let it roam.

I had to run a few errands and I saw the guy in his driveway on my way.  I stopped to talk to him and introduced myself.  He seemed very nice and welcomed me and my parents to the lake.  I then brought up how I've noticed a lot of people let their dogs roam and asked if that was normal.  He said that a lot of people have lived here their whole lives or had parents that lived here and that's just the way it's always been.  The dogs get good exercise and everyone kind of watches out for them.

I told him that my parents had been complaining about it and asked if he could spread word around to people to make sure their dogs stay off my parent's property.  He asked if his dog had strayed over there and I told him that it hadn't, but it had come close.  He said he keeps a hunting collar on his dog and will beep it to bring the dog home if he needs to, but he usually just lets her run.  

I asked him again if he could mention it to other neighbors to keep their dogs closer to home.  He said he would, but it won't exactly endear my parents to their new neighbors.  He said there are other people that moved there from the city who tried to change the way people lived there and they were basically ostracized from the community.  He told me that if my parents really have a problem with it, they are probably better off building a fence or hoping that they never do anything to bother anyone else or need anyone's help.

I told him that not wanting other people's dogs on your property isn't a strange concept.

In addition, my brother has some behavioral challenges and he would be very challenging to take on a trip by myself while still trying to give Sophie a great trip.

He started to yell at me more and more for homework or my bed not being made. All of this because of R telling him to and when he found out R was cheating on him. He decided to move to move to Florida to be with the girl who's husband cheated on her with R. Selling everything in my room to drive down there. For three years he lived in between Florida and Tennessee. Calling or texting every few months to update on what he's doing. But during that my Mother met my step dad who, raised me and my brothers as his own built that trust and friendship with us. 

L is has been sober for the past year and I'm proud of him but I am still hurt by everything he did to me as a kid I needed him there to support me but he made me feel worse about myself. My fiance says it's up to me if I want him there or not and I'm torn about it cause I feel bad if I don't. Part of me wants him to be there and apologize for everything that happened but I don't think he ever will. So AITA

Update: the reason I think I'd be the Asshole: He would only be a guest Not the father of the bride that's reserved for my step father 

Update 2: thank you all being honest I was expecting this to just drown but, I'm going to ask him to go to coffee with me and see what he thinks.

55,1cnbsq7,WIBTA for not picking up my roommate's sister?,"I (23M) and my roommate (24M) have been living together for a few months. We were friends before moving in. Things have been going fine, just common roommate disputes about common chores. 

This is extremely low stakes btw. So if you like banal drama, this is for you.

Yesterday he asked me if I could pick up his sister from the airport. I work nearby and it'd be easier than him driving to the airport (the fight is quick). I said sure, and common to our friendship to this point I asked him what I'd get in return. When I ask anything of him he asks, jokingly or not, what's ""in it for him"". It rubs me the wrong way, so I started asking it back. We dont really touch on it past then.

Later last night my roommate re-asked if I could, and I said sure, but then he said something along the lines of ""We're ordering dinner tomorrow and I'll comp you. Oh wait nevermind I'm making dinner for the both of us"". I was taken aback because again it feels a little rude to be ""measuring"" how much I am doing for him vs. what he's giving. This also threw me off because I cooked dinner for both of us on Sunday. We never cooked for eachother before. I said ""Well I cooked dinner for you before, and if you're gonna measure this kinda stuff you can pick her up"". 

He said that he feels he needs to say stuff like that so he doesn't give and recieve nothing back. This upset me as every time I go to the store I always get a snack for him, to be kind. Even that morning I got him a tea from the coffee shop when he asked (he said he'd venmo me). While I try my best to expect nothing back for these things, being told that I ""give nothing back"" made me feel unappreciated.

He said it was about chores. He works from home sometimes and I don't, so he has more time to do chores, he acknowledged that but stil feels he does more than me. Our levels of cleanliness are different, I'm a bit more messy than him (nothing gross like food and stuff). He said he's felt this ""for months"" and he felt like we didn't need to talk as it was a small thing and would be a ""big thing"" if we did. This was a suprise to me since we talked about it before and made a plan, but since he felt that way we agreed to change the duties. He said he appreciates the things I mentioned before but theyre in a seperate category than chores.

I get it, though it feels like he's measuring the things I do like this as a way to make up for the chore difference, while not talking to me about it. I feel he is drawing lines and then blurring them, as he says the other things I do are seperate from chores but then he is asking me to get his sister.

I have no interest now in picking up his sister. I feel bad since I both said yes & ate the dinner he cooked last night (we agreed on dinner before he asked). I feel a little upset that when I do kind things it either ""doesnt count"" towards this score he has in his mind or is making up for something he never even discussed with me yet.

EDIT: really doubt anyone is circling back to this one but I texted my roommate and asked for his sister's # so we can communicate while I'm trying to pick her up. I agreed to do it, and expressing my dissatisfaction with the ""score keeping"" is something I need to do, but  I absolutely see how not picking her up after I agreed to is counterintuitive.

56,1cnb80g,AITA for telling my friend to grow up after accusing my gf and I of “abandoning” her?,"This all happened a little while ago. Some mutual friends of my gf and I wanted to have a “wine night” at Uni, and so we went out to go get some with one of our friends. My gf is 22, and my friend and I are 21. 

Well, it was snowing out a bit, and the closest liquor store to campus is a 25 minute drive. As we progressed, the roads started getting worse and almost undriveable. My gf was driving, as she’s very experienced navigating such conditions since she’s the only one who lives in the area, but we were in her mom’s Chevvy Equinox since her Jeep was being worked on at this point. If we had the Jeep with four-wheel drive, it would have been much safer. Thankfully, we made it out there with no issues, but our friend wanted to get weed at the dispensary before going to the liquor store. The road up to the dispensary is very steep with big ditches on both sides at the bottom, so my gf and I were just going to forget about it, but my friend insisted we drop her off to walk up herself. 

We let her do that, and decided to drive down a bit to find a safer place to turn around and get her bc of the ditches. Took about ten minutes, and I tried to text/call my friend, but the service was bad and things weren’t going through. When we finally picked her up, she got in the car and went off on us, saying we abandoned her, that what we did was scary and uncalled for, and that now she doesn’t know if she can trust us. She was on the verge of hysteria. I assured her we would never leave her like that, and that we were just trying to be safe. If we fell in a ditch, who knows how long we’d have to wait to get pulled out. She didn’t really listen to what I was saying, and kept going on and on about how she was standing out in the cold waiting for us. 

Ever since then, things had been weird between her, my gf, and I. She and I had a cordial conversation where I once again tried to explain how we were trying to stay safe as people literally die going out in the snow and getting stuck waiting for help. It seemed like I was starting to get through to her, but then she went and talked to my gf and was real nasty. The first thing she said upon entering my gf’s room is, “So, do you have anything to say to me?” She never apologized for the things she had said to us, even though I apologized for scaring her. After that whole thing went down, I started distancing myself, but also for some other factors that I won’t get into. I also didn’t fw the fact that she was treating me nice but my gf horribly. 

At some point she must’ve realized that I was keeping my distance, and came to ask me about it, to which I told her I didn’t like what she was doing, and that she needed to grow up.

57,1cnazwp,AITA for not inviting my sister on a paid vacation,"Hi all. 

My fiancé Ethan (34m) and I (31f) got engaged this past November. My parent-in-laws gifted us an all-paid vacation to Bali for 10 days in June. Unfortunately, Ethan has an important trial scheduled during the dates and cannot make the trip. We told his parents that they should go instead but they insisted that I go and take whoever I want with me, they will use the credit from Ethan’s ticket for the replacement ticket. 

I thought about it and invited my mother-in-law,  Rose. She’s a sweet woman who goes above and beyond for us so this was my way of showing my appreciation for her. Rose decided that we should make it a girl’s trip so upgraded the room to a multi-bedroom suite and invited her daughter (my SIL) Emily and her other daughter-in-law, Rebecca. 


Here is why I am being told that I am the asshole. My sister Sarah (28f) has always dreamed of visiting Bali, she’s been talking about it for years. She was practically foaming at the mouth during Christmas dinner when my in-laws gave Ethan and I the gift. Sarah and her husband cannot afford to vacation much so her dream to visit Bali is on hold for the foreseeable future.

Sarah came to visit me two weeks and asked about the trip so I told her about the change in plans and it being a girl’s trip now. She called me an asshole and went on a rant that I’m a selfish b*tch for not inviting her in Ethan’s place.  She blocked both Ethan and I everywhere and got my entire family involved. She even went on a social media rant. 

My parents are mortified with her actions but some of my friends and relatives are saying that I am the asshole because I didn’t think of my sister at all.

I (F17) have a friend, H(F16 going 17), who is having a party in a few weeks for their birthday. At my birthday, I introduced my younger sister (F16) who’ll I’ll call M to my friendship group.

They got along really well, and I was very happy about that. M, although not diagnosed, struggles with anxiety; especially socially. We all play games together and we all have a good time, and more often than not I’ll find her in calls for hours with my friends without me present, which wasn’t always something she felt comfortable doing.

H had invited another friend on ours, J (M17) to their party who isn’t able to come, and E(NB16) who is coming. E is dating a guy called S who is super chill, I have a few classes with them and we are decently close. E suggested H invite S to their party, and H agreed and invited them within the hour when we saw them.

When I got home, I asked M if she would like to be invited as well, with my mother in ear shot. My mother took this as me inviting M on H’s behalf. That was absolutely not the case and never was. I wanted to see if M would be comfortable with that, since she’s only met them irl a few times and mainly talks to them through discord, and then I’d SUGGEST the idea to H since they are both quite close.

However, my mother refused to listen to my reason. I didn’t want to suggest the idea to H, they like the idea and ask my sister only for her to say no as that would be awkward (no blame to M tho, I get she might not be comfortable and thats fair), so I thought if I did it this way worse case scenario is H says no and thats that. 

I’m not so much asking about if I’m an asshole for fighting with my mum over it, I’m more asking if what I did/planned to do made me an asshole, as its almost identical to what E did and everyone was fine with that.

Update, if you could call it that: yeah I’m now seeing my issue here. Thank you all for pointing this out for me, you’ve saved me a LOT of awkward conversations.

62,1cnaecf,AITA for asking my Roomate to move out on time?,"So, my lease ends on May 20th this year, and my current roomie is moving out to live with her boyfriend. He has an apartment that’s super close to ours, with a lot of space. 

Here’s the issue: my Roomate is working in a nearby city this summer, and she’s asked me to keep all of her things at my apartment until August. I don’t think this is fair to my new Roomate, who will have to sleep on the couch or in a bedroom crowded with random furniture, moving boxes, etc. for months until August comes.

My current Roomate is mad at me for asking her to move her things out by May 20th, saying she doesn’t have time. I told her I could get some friends over and we could all help her, but she denied the offer. Now, it’s pretty close to May 20th and she hasn’t started packing. I’ve asked her when she plans on moving her things, and she’s said “well I don’t know when I’ll get a chance to come back.” I’ve even told her I would pay for a storage unit myself, she denied that too.


Onto the next issue: she has a lot of stuff, there’s no way to move it “out of the way” in our tiny apartment. She’s also allergic to cats, like really allergic, and my next Roomate is moving in with a long hair cat. I know how cats are, and it’s very unlikely a cat would not mess with her stuff (laying on it, scenting it, scratching, getting hair on it, etc.) I told her this and she said it was our responsibility to keep the cat away from her things. 

Edit: This is where I might be the asshole, I insinuated to her that if she keeps her stuff here later than June, I will forcibly move it myself. She’s said that’s crazy and a violation of her privacy. 

Now, after a few days of going back and forth about moving plans, she won’t even talk to me. I have tried messaging her, and even saying hi to her in the house, but she is completely silent. Like, walk right past me in the kitchen without responding silent. I don’t know what to do, she’s a good friend of mine and I want to help, but I also think it’s fair to expect her to follow the apartment lease terms and move out sooner than August. 

Another Edit: thank you all, I realize this is another case of an aita post where op is being reasonable, but my Roomate has created such a stink over me being unfair & mean to her that I felt the need to get validation from Reddit 🫡

65,1cn9vzg,AITA for wanting to book separate rooms?,"Me (30M) and my girlfriend (22F) were planning to go on vacation in August with another friend couple (28M 36F), their kids (3M 1F) and their dog. For context, I'm also the godfather of their eldest child (3M).  
We were initially looking for an house rental to book, individual bedrooms and all, so that it'd be cheaper. However after having a talk with my gf we kinda changed our mind and would prefer to book a separate place for us, for the following reasons:

*  They were hoping to split the bill between everyone, and I don't think that is fair. While I'm their son's godfather, I'm not responsible for the kid and I don't want to pay for them plus the dog. Their kids, their expenses.
*  They want a place with a kitchen so that they can cook and save some money. I don't want to pay for a place with kitchen + groceries, because when I'm on vacation I just prefer going to restaurants. I don't want to cook, I want to relax.
*  We enjoy our privacy, their children require care, attention, cry a lot, throw tantrums, etc, so it's just hard for me + gf to be comfortable and enjoy our stay. Also after 9PM the kids go to sleep and we can't make noise, so no sexy time and no loud talking for example.

72,1cn94l9,WIBTA for wanting the AC on in 85F degree weather?,"I live with my elderly grandmother, and yesterday I noticed the thermostat indicated the house temperature was 80•f. It’s summer time in the south with the outdoor temp being 84*F, but when I brought this up to her she mentioned she turned it off because I like to leave one of my bedroom windows slightly open.
 (There’s over 20 other windows in the house and they’re always closed) 

I crack my window for fresh air, as certain smells trigger my nausea due to pregnancy nose. I asked her if she was hot, she said no, but said “Pick one, either ac with window closed, or no ac and window open” so I said okay, and I went to go close my window. After closing it I turned the ac on. She got mad and yelled, “YOU DIDN’T ASK ME TO TURN ON THE AC!” but I reminded her what she said about picking one. 

I told her I chose to close the window, but she still angrily said I “didn’t communicate,” and I didn’t quite understand what she meant by that, so I asked her if she wanted me to turn it off? She said “That’s your response? Really? Yeah turn it off. It’ll stay off all year for all I care.” So I was like “okay..?” And turned it back off because I don’t understand what she’s so angry about, but I wasn’t about to bother with it and risk unnecessary stress on me and my baby. Am I missing something crucial here?

Anyway, I started to hang out on the cool leather couch in the living room with the fan on to cool down a bit. She came in and turned it off to prove her point I guess. I still didn’t bother, and decided to take a nap instead. The couch was still cool anyway. 

I should mention my grandma loves to hike, and on a recent trip to a mountain in Tennessee, she fell down breaking her arm and her knee, so she’s in a cast and a wheelchair. Despite this, she still gets up and does things on her own like loading the dishwasher, or using the bathroom on her own while refusing help from me, but when her friends and other family is around she acts like she cannot get up and do things, and makes them carry her to bed knowing she gets up through the night to pee, walks around to turn the AC off, and gets back in bed herself when they aren’t around. 

I think she’s just trying to prove a point of some sort, I’m not sure how long she’ll go with it, but she stopped talking to me and it’s really strange because I didn’t do anything wrong. She got up through the night multiple times to make sure the AC was still off, but she slept with her fan on and complained to her friends that she is having “hot flashes.” This morning on my way to make breakfast I noticed she had the oven on with nothing in it. The oven was radiating high heat to the point where the microwave handle above it was hot too. Like I said she’s really trying to prove some sort of point? The thermostat still says 80*F and is still off. I haven’t bothered with the situation because this is her house and I’m not trying to disrespect her, but I don’t know what to do. Opening my window doesn’t help cool down as it’s hotter outside.

UPDATE: The oven made the house way too hot for her to bear, she also has guests in the house so now she felt guilty enough to turn the AC on. I couldn’t help but effing laugh… AITA FOR FINDING THIS COMICAL???? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-08,"WIBTA for wanting the AC on in 85F degree weather? I live with my elderly grandmother, and yesterday I noticed the thermostat indicated the house temperature was 80•f. It’s summer time in the south with the outdoor temp being 84*F, but when I brought this up to her she mentioned she turned it off because I like to leave one of my bedroom windows slightly open.
 (There’s over 20 other windows in the house and they’re always closed) 

I crack my window for fresh air, as certain smells trigger my nausea due to pregnancy nose. I asked her if she was hot, she said no, but said “Pick one, either ac with window closed, or no ac and window open” so I said okay, and I went to go close my window. After closing it I turned the ac on. She got mad and yelled, “YOU DIDN’T ASK ME TO TURN ON THE AC!” but I reminded her what she said about picking one. 

I told her I chose to close the window, but she still angrily said I “didn’t communicate,” and I didn’t quite understand what she meant by that, so I asked her if she wanted me to turn it off? She said “That’s your response? Really? Yeah turn it off. It’ll stay off all year for all I care.” So I was like “okay..?” And turned it back off because I don’t understand what she’s so angry about, but I wasn’t about to bother with it and risk unnecessary stress on me and my baby. Am I missing something crucial here?

Anyway, I started to hang out on the cool leather couch in the living room with the fan on to cool down a bit. She came in and turned it off to prove her point I guess. I still didn’t bother, and decided to take a nap instead. The couch was still cool anyway. 

I should mention my grandma loves to hike, and on a recent trip to a mountain in Tennessee, she fell down breaking her arm and her knee, so she’s in a cast and a wheelchair. Despite this, she still gets up and does things on her own like loading the dishwasher, or using the bathroom on her own while refusing help from me, but when her friends and other family is around she acts like she cannot get up and do things, and makes them carry her to bed knowing she gets up through the night to pee, walks around to turn the AC off, and gets back in bed herself when they aren’t around.

73,1cn92i0,AITA for saying I’m glad I was adopted separately from my siblings?,"My (28M) biological mother was severely mentally ill and unequipped to take care of children. But it wasn’t something anyone realized until she already had 5 kids. I was the oldest. I was 5 when my first sibling was born and instantly became a father figure (3 of my siblings have the same dad, myself and my brother have different dads) and learned how to do everything very young. When my mom was in a good space, she’d help but I was still doing most of the work.

When I was 13 and my siblings were 8, 7, 5 and 4, we were removed from my mother’s custody. Our social worker and our first foster home realized that I was struggling to let go of being “the parent”. I also had other issues they felt would do better with therapy and a home where I was the only child. My siblings were placed in a new foster home where they were eventually adopted.

I was placed in a separate home with amazing foster parents who were patient and willing to help me find my way. I was adopted 2 years in when I was 15. I got to be a kid for the first time. I went to football games, prom, was able to focus on school and go to college. I had some contact with my siblings but their adoptive family made it difficult.

Now that they’re all adults (they’re 23, 22, 20 and 19)we’ve began to reconnect and get to know each other better. 3 of my siblings have just began therapy. The youngest is hesitant. All of them say that their adoptive parents were amazing but they resent them for pushing me out as well as not being willing to adopt me.

I explained to them that it was the social worker and courts who felt it was best I was adopted separately. They said that was BS and we should’ve all stayed together. I tried to be neutral and validate their feelings. However, they then began shit talking *my* adoptive parents and said they were wrong for adopting me and not trying to advocate for us to be together. 

That was my line in the sand. I said my adoptive parents did the best thing for me and it’s what I needed. The 23 year old then asked me if I’m happy we were separated. I said I’m not happy about our life circumstances that lead to these choices being made but given they were our circumstances, I’m glad I was given a chance. 

My 22 and 19 year old sisters actually understand where I’m coming from and have since come around. However, my 23 year old brother and 20 year old sister think it was a nasty thing to say. I said I don’t appreciate my parents being spoken about that way and I’d never trash talk their parents. Plus, it’s my truth just as much as it is theirs when they admit they had a good childhood and were happy they were adopted. 

Important info: 4 of us who attend therapy do have family counseling sessions. However, they’re about once every 3 months due to insurance and we won’t see her again until July.

Roommates 1 and I always make sure to clean our dishes after cooking pretty much right away. We also clean the pots, pans and strainers after cooking so if someone else needs to cook, they can use it. Roommate 1 and I are also the only ones that run the dishwasher and put the clean dishes away. 

Roommate 2 will leave her dishes in the sink, throw all the pots and pans (and cooking knives) in the dishwasher but she never actually runs it or puts the dishes away. I have asked her nicely for two years to please take care of it and she continues to not do so. She also doesn’t realize that I take out the trash, refill soaps, vacuum the common space, wipe surfaces down, etc and don’t ask her to do that at all and I’m okay with doing that. All I ask is wash your dishes like everyone else.

I sent a text this morning in the group chat asking “whoever’s this is, I will take care of it this time but please clean up after yourself”. Her response was “it’s not that deep. I’ll do it later” I absolutely lost it and said “it’s not that deep? It wouldn’t be that deep if I asked you one time but this is not the first time I’ve asked. I’m tired of cleaning up after able bodied adults and if we want to be rude we can be rude”. My text was hostile but I’m always cleaning up after her and she doesn’t get it. 

She then said “I’ll be quicker but I’m sick of being called out. When you guys have people over (we had people over once in the last six months and a bag of tortillas was left out that I quickly put away), I don’t complain. We all have different lifestyles and I’m more flexible with it”. I said “okay I’ll be better with that. However, I have never seen you unload the washer or run the washer.

75,1cn8z64,AITA for telling my friend that he can't move in with me and my gf?,"When I (19m) moved into my uni halls, I met my friend Sam (20m) as we share a flat. Sam isn't someone I would chose to live with out of choice. He's messy and would rather drink his money away than pay his bills - he's constantly asking his parents for money. Sam also isn't a fan of my gf, Imogen (18f), because her family have money. Imogen and I have been together for 3 years. I love her more than anything, we've known each other since we were kids. 

Before Christmas when Imogen came to stay at my uni flat, we had a look at some flats. Imogen is hoping to attend university in my city in September and her mum decided she was buying a glat so Imogen had somewhere safe to live. The flats we were looking at her mum had short listed and she just had to pick the one she liked. Despite being told no, Sam tagged along. At this point I was planning on staying in halls again for my second year. 

When everything was sorted with the flat purchase, Imogen and her mum asked me if I wanted to move in with Imogen. Her mum said that she wouldn't charge me rent but it would be up to us to pay the bills, etc. I jumped at the chance to move in with Imogen. Her mum is absolutely wonderful. When I couldn't afford my train home at Christmas, she paid for it so I could see my family and has refused to take any money back from it. When I was packing to leave for uni, she bought me a delivery pass for the nearest supermarket so I could focus on my studies. She's always said if I ever need anything that I just need to ask her. I haven't because I don't want to take advantage of her generosity nor do I want her to think I'm dating Imogen for money. 

Sam saw me coming out of the office in our building last week and asked what I was doing. I told him I had put notice in to not have my contracted renewed because I was moving in with Imogen. Sam didn't have plans for where he was going to live next year. He just got excited and ran off. That night in the pub, he drunkenly announced to our friend group he was moving in with me and Imogen next year and no longer had to worry about where he was going to stay. I told Sam that he absolutely wasn't moving in with us and even if l wanted him to, its not my choice as Imogen’s mum owns the flat. 

Sam has now been crying to everyone that he's homeless next year and it's all Imogen’s fault. Our friends are telling me that I should just let him stay. Some have found Imogen’s insta and have messaged her calling her a bitch and saying she needs to let Sam live with us.

76,1cn8nrz,AITA for telling my husband that his grown nephew and his GF cannot move in ,"My husbands nephew moved into his grandparents home at 16. He is now 24 and is still leaving at the grandparents home with his GF that does not work and her 7 YO daughter. They do not clean much, if at all and are sloppy in many ways. Just recently husbands father passed (the Grandpa) and nephew is still living there without paying bills. We are in the process of closing the estate. He will have to either move or finds a way to pay all the bills. He does not make enough and  his GF 28 YO does not work. My husband wants to move them in to our home. SO he can keep his inheritance of his dads 401 k, muscle cars etc. I do NOT want them to move in.

We do not have children we are both 40 YO and have (3) cats.  I feel that if they move in they will not leave, in fact im about 97% sure of this. The fact that nephews GF does not work or support her own child that is not his really bothers me. I halfway caved and said the Nephew can move in but husband said He is not breaking up a family.  They are not married , and I feel this is too much. Husband could give them money to set them up in apartment or townhome ,something but he feels that its setting him up for failure. That in a year he would be back with nowhere to live. I feel this is NOT our responsibility to take care of grown nephew and the people he chooses to date. Nor is it our responsibility if he goes out into the world and cannot make it on his own.  Though I would help them as long as real effort is being made.

This has caused a HUGE rift between us. Husband at this point has said he will do whatever he feels necessary and I can deal with it.  I said in anger that If he does so, I will be moving out along with my animals.  I know if they do move in. I will end up going off on them and asking them to move out. I do not do well with others in my living space. I need my sanctuary or my anxiety goes through the roof. So it is looking like either way I'm out of luck.  So, AITA for not wanting to take them in?

EDIT: The nephew is doing the best he can with the amount he makes and is trying. His GF is not and sleeping till noon daily, will not get a drivers license even though we bought her a car. Most mornings she doesn't even take her child to the bus stop. My Nephew has to do so.   As well as any effort to clean up.

Edit: The child is in elementary school and is not home between 8-3:30 PM

Edit: Husband has just now went back to work after taking care of his father who died of cancer. He had to go into his retirement fund to do so and was out of work 6 months. He wants to use funds from the estate to replace his retirement funds that were used

Edit:Father received full custody when nephew was one years old. Then mother disappeared. Father left his son (nephew) with the grandparent and abandoned him. Father is estranged from family

Edit: We are paying the grandfather houses bills through the estate. Though funds for this will not last long. Myself, I have been paying all me and my Husbands bills for the past 6 months. Before this he would pay the mortgage and I paid all utilities etc. This worked for us. 

Husband has always taken my feelings into account in all things but this time he doesn't seem to care. I know it is due to stress and he seems to think this is the right thing to do. His parents always took in stragglers but that is not my way. He has an issue with the child being upset and breaking up his nephews family. Husbands family has always been low on money.

79,1cn7096,AITA for moving out of my parent's house when my brother and his family moved in?,"There is a whole lot of unnecessary back story I will leave out.  

I rented my parent's house after they retired and moved south. I paid slightly below market rate. The plan was for me to save up and eventually buy the house at a great price. They would then give that money to my brother as his part of their estate. My share was the subsidized rent and the very subsidized purchase agreement. 

Everyone thought this was fair. Until my brother's wife started running up debts they couldn't cover.  This lead to them losing their home and needing help. I love my brother and my nephews so when my mom asked me if they could move in I talked to my husband and we agreed. We are in the process of adopting two siblings but we are still not there. It was only going to be temporary so why not. 

Half off the rent for a few months would totally help us with the down payment and expenses. They moved in in February. When March rolled around I sent transferred half my usual rent to my parents. My mom called to ask me where the rest was. I said I assumed that Brad was paying the other half. Nope. I had to pay all the rent. I asked why I had to pay for them to stay in my house. My mom said it wasn't my house yet and that I was being mouthy. 

I saw the writing on the wall. I paid the rent and started looking. We had a good amount saved up and we didn't need a big old house with lots of maintenance issues we had been handling. 

We paid the full rent in April as well. But we moved out and into the house we closed on. It was ready for immediate possession. With my husband and I having decent income and 25% down it went smoothly. The only downside is the much smaller yard. But it is a block away from a public park so we aren't losing much. 

I did tell my parents we were leaving. May first I got another call from my mom. She wanted the rent. I said I wasn't living there any more. She said I was breaking our deal. I said that our deal never included me paying for my brother's living expenses. She said  that they couldn't afford to cover the mortgage without my rent. I told her to get money from my brother. He was still working. She said he was trying to pay his debts. I said that his wife should get a job. 

I could write a much longer post just on this discussion. 

Long story short she said I was being cheap and viscous to my brother and to my parents.

80,1cn6vgx,AITA for allowing my (34 f) 2.5 year old toddler to tantrum in an apartment complex?,"Context - our family just relocated from New York to Portugal about a month ago, moving from a house to a flat. We’re on the first floor, so no one below us, but we do have neighbors next to and above us. 

I (34 F) and DH (37 M) have a pretty cool toddler. She’s just shy of 2.5 years old (“Ivy”). 

We’ve been intentional about how we’ve raised Ivy, specifically with discipline. We take her to her room for time out (turn on her noise machine, explain why she’s in time out, let her work through her feelings/ take deep breaths together). 

Recently a nanny (Ana 22 F) began working with Ivy. I see them play together and have no concerns. However, Ivy seems to be having some separation anxiety or something similar.  

First incident, when we first moved in and tried to get Ivy to sleep in her room, I tried for hours to get her to sleep. Eventually, DH suggested we let her cry it out in her room. I adamantly disagreed but had given up at that point and let him handle it. She’d been crying on and off allllll night but when he left her in there alone, she really amped things up. After about 20ish minutes, we met our upstairs neighbor who asked if she’s okay? Did she need medicine? We caved and let her sleep in our room for the first time in her life. This has now lasted the entire move.

Leading up to today. Ana came over to play with Ivy, who had only napped for 20 minutes (yay sleep regression in the middle of an international move). Ivy threw an absolute fit when I insisted that Ana could help Ivy put on a new shirt. Ivy was unwilling to allow Ana to help. She threw herself on the floor and scream cried like I’d thrown her in boiling water. I took Ana and Ivy into Ivy’s room for timeout to see if we could remedy things. 

First time in timeout, Ivy took 5 deep breaths after about 2 minutes and we came back out to play. When I insisted, again, that Ana would help Ivy, Ivy flipped out again. We went back into time out. This tantrum involved high pitch screaming, yelling, etc. Eventually I heard banging on the walls, which Ana confirmed hearing as well. It had probably been 10-15 minutes of a tantrum at 15:00. I haven’t wanted to give into tantrums because it will reinforce the behaviors but after hearing the banging noise from some neighbors, I removed Ivy from her room to the living room and finally relented to helping her get dressed myself and gave her comfort. All in all, from beginning of first tantrum to the end, I would estimate it was 30 minutes in total.

Am I an asshole for not changing my behaviors now that we live in a flat? We don’t let her just scream in her room and we’re there with her working through it all, but I also don’t want to just give into what she’s asking for to end the tantrum.

AITA for mowing the lawn? 

I (33f) and my husband (34m) have been married for about 5 years. We have lived together for 7. We have always had our chores set for us (he usually does lawn care stuff and outdoor stuff, while I handle everything else.) we also both work full time. Now that it’s summer our lawn has been growing quickly and needs a mow every week. My husband has been slacking on it quite a bit, and when I mention it he goes on saying how it’s hot and that we have a large yard so it’s wears him down but that he’ll get to it. Our HOA has already complained once this year about it. 

I had a day off and decided to mow the lawn while he was at work. Turns out I quite enjoy it! I was able to listen to music and knock it out the front and back in a couple of hours. 

When my husband got home he asked me why I mowed the lawn and I let him know I had some time to do it since I finished the indoor chores. He was really frustrated with me. I told him that it wasn’t a big deal, and that I actually really like doing it because it gives me some time to just shut off and enjoy the outdoors, and that I wouldn’t mind doing it more. He pushed back saying it was his job and now he feels useless. I told him he could do more indoor chores since the lawn has been taken care of for the week which made him very upset. He said he also likes mowing the lawn for the same reasons i listed and doesn’t want to change how we have the chores set up, but I said if he likes it so much then it would be getting done.

The previous owner talked up this house and it looked great for us to offer over asking and so he accepted our offer and didn't find out about who we were until after the offer was accepted. Conversations were filtered by both of our realtors and we closed on the house.

The day that we closed on the house he was finalizing some of the things we agreed upon that he would repair as part of the house and moving the rest of the stuff out which he allowed. He specifically mentioned us being able to use the paint and tiles that he left behind for any spot work as we move. He then specified that if there were any concerns we had with the house to contact him and at the very least he could fix it or he could give us recommendations of contractors that we could use. After that night, he left some trim, three lawn mowers, tiles, paint, ladders, and various pieces. He had come over one other time after that after a toilet issue, which he said he'd replace.

After that he ghosted us and my family who were friends with this person. After a certain period of time, we realized we were on our own for repairs and decided to carry on. The stuff he left behind was taking up space and one of the people that helped me move offered to take one of the mowers where the self propelling was broken but he was confident he could fix it.

Now after a month of not hearing anything from him, he texted my partner yesterday asking if he can come by to pick up his stuff (i.e trim and paint) and now I am wondering if I was wrong for giving one of the mowers away.

My partner, 29F, Thea, is a plumber, and we have scrounged and saved. In the end we bought land and built a tiny house in the uptown area of our city. It has two bedrooms and one bathroom, one of the bedrooms is our reptile room, as I keep snakes and Thea keeps bearded dragons. We are child-free and happy in our home.

My Sister ""Lucy"" 34F, is a waitress and has three kids (M4, M3, M2). Her husband just left her for a woman my age and she is left without his income to raise all three kids on her own. Her husband bought out her half of the house during the divorce and that left her and the kids living with my mom in the trailer.

I can admit I didn't grow up in the safest of areas and was carrying a knife when I was a teenager because of the danger. Because of the safety issue, Lucy came to Thea and I and begged us to let her and her sons move in. She said we would have to get rid of our reptiles or keep them in our room, her sons could have the other bedroom, and she would sleep in our kitchen on an air mattress. She said nothing about paying us rent or helping around the house.

I told her no, because two toddlers and a little kid who is about to start kindergarten aren't suitable to be in our home and we don't want too many people in our house. She said that we live in a better part of town with better schools and that she needed the help. I told her we didn't have the room and that I was sorry, but I could hook her up with some journeymen I know and she could get started on an apprenticeship that pays better than her current job if she needed extra money.

She called my job and Thea's job ""Dirty blue collar trash"" and left our home. She posted about how we wouldn't let her stay online, and now my relatives are messaging me about, ""How could I let a single mother and 3 kids be homeless,"" How ""they're your blood,"" and ""You owe your sister better than that."" I feel like a complete asshole even though Thea told me I have every right not to want them in our house. AITA?

  
AFTER DINNER WITH MY XBIL EDIT: Thea and I went to dinner with my XBIL tonight. He brought his laptop and showed us all of the documentation.  
1.) Lucy used her proceeds from the house to pay for her attorney, even though my XBIL offered to pay (timestamped e-mails to prove it)  
2.) The woman living with him is his niece, not his AP, as Lucy claimed. (She came to the meeting; they have pictures and phone records showing that she is my XBIL's older sister's daughter.)  
3.) LUCY CHEATED: ALL 3 BOYS AREN'T HIS. And DNA tests show that they all have different dads. So Lucy has been having multiple affairs.   
4.) The 300 he is sending each month is a good will payment for allowing him to be a dad for a few years.   
5.) Lucy isn't waitressing, she is working for Amway and another company called Sentsy in direct sales.  
6.) Lucy won't do an apprenticeship because it doesn't fall under traditional gender roles (posts on a second social media account)  
7.) Lucy has made homophobic posts on social media about me and my wife, and blocked us so we didn't see them.

86,1cn4et4,AITA for throwing my tampons in the trash where my father can see them?,"Hi, so I (f/18) still live at home with my father (m/60) and my mother (f/58). We have two bathrooms, one in the front of the house and one further towards the back. My parents sleep seperately from each other, and my mothers bedroom is in the back of the house, so she uses the bathroom towards the back. My father and I sleep in neighbouring rooms, so we bith tend to use the front bathroom more often, especially at night. I never use the bathroom in the back.

Here's the issue: My father is very uneducated about periods. I have strong cramps and bleed a lot, so sometimes accidents happen, or I can't get out of bed all day. At times, I try to explain it to him, when he asks e.g. 'Why did you come home from school so early?'. I always get halfway through a sentence and once I say I bled through my pad or tampon or something, he cuts me of by scrunching his face up in disgust, rasing hand and saying something like 'That's enough.' 
When I'm on my period, I have to change my tampons a lot. And when I do, I go to the toilet, throw the used tampon + pad in the trash, and leave the toilet bowl and seat, and sometimes the sink (like I said, it's gets quite bloody) queaky clean when I leave.
A few days ago, my father approached me, and told me I should wrap my tampons and pads in toilet paper when I throw them away, so he shouldn't have to see them in the trash. I was confused, and asked why I couldn't just throw my tampons and pads in the trash where they belong. Like, why is he so bothered by it? It doesn't even smell. The trashcan has a lid, and everything. And I always make sure I clean up the mess after I leave the bathroom. Then, my mother chimed in and told me I should be more considerate of my father.
I told them both I don't think periods are disgusting, or need to be hidden away, like they don't exist. I think they're being misogynistic, and I don't want to treat my period as something shameful, that especially men 'shouldn't have to see', especially in my own home, with my own parents. It's not like my father has to touch my period blood, or come into contact with it in any way. He literally just has to see the used tampon/pad in the trash for a tiny second, when he throws something away, before the lid of the bin is closed agan. My parents think I'm in the wrong, but I want to stay firm in my principles. 
I'm not accusing my father of misogyny out of the blue. He is very openly misogynistic. But my mother joining in on the pressing, and telling me I'm wrong has me doubting myself. I have very strong values in regards to women's rights, and don't want to enable my father in his misogyny.

TLDR; My father is grossed out by periods. I always clean up after myself in the bathroom, but throw my tampons and pads in the trash (closed lid bin), like I would anything else. Now, my father and mother are telling me I'm being inconsiderate for not wrapping my tampons and pads in toilet paper beforehand.",Asshole,2024-05-08,"AITA for throwing my tampons in the trash where my father can see them?

87,1cn4and,AITA for not wanting to discuss my new medical condition with my mother? ,"Hi all, sorry it's my first post on Reddit and I'm nervous. I (31F) was diagnosed with alopecia areata about 6 months ago and wear a wig full-time. I'm absolutely fine with my situation and live a normal life.   
  
I live abroad and have not told my mom, as it didn't seem necessary (I see her once a year, and we're not close). Yesterday, during a short catch up texting conversation I sent her a group photo I took with friends. She noticed my ""hair"" was a different length and color and asked why I changed it. I assumed she knew it was a wig, as it's not a very expensive one.   
  
I told her that I was nervous to explain my situation to her and explained my new reality. She was very upset that I didn't tell her and insisted on getting a doctor from my home country for a ""real opinion"", as well as giving a litany of other reasons on why I no longer have hair.   
  
I politely explained that I'm not upset about my new situation, that I'm fine with wigs and would like to be treated normally - and that I would like to not discuss my condition any further. I then changed the topic and asked her to catch me up on her friends, her plans, etc. but she was having none of it. She has been giving me the silent treatment and sending one-word responses since.

88,1cn42pk,AITA for not being supportive of my husbands new golf hobby? ,"
We have been together for 10 years, and I have been a stay at home mom for now 7 years, to our children (7 & 2). My husband and I do everything together, every concert, sporting event, ect. Over the course of our marriage we have done something individually a total of 5ish times. It has never been an issue until recently when my husband wanted to try/get into golf. Over the past month he has gone out twice, and to the range a couple times as well. 

Over the course of the month it has been obvious that I have been upset and we have both tried to address the issue. He is upset that I am not encouraging the one thing he’s endeavored to do without me by asking how it went and if he had fun. That I show no interest in it, and he thinks I am totally against him going. I have tried to express that while him having a hobby isn’t an issue for me, but that it is making me feel trapped home and essentially, ‘I want to play too’. Not golf, but I’d like an opportunity to get out of the house away from the kids. That his hobby is making me feel jealous. His argument is I haven’t asked to do anything, he’s never told me no. He works a lot of hours and I feel uncomfortable asking to do things without him. In these conversations I have explained that I want to establish some sort of communication or boundaries that allow for us to each get out.

This all came to a head quickly and within that argument, it was made clear that he feels that because he works and lets me stay home with out a job I should be happy. That I am being selfish and making this about me.

89,1cn3zfu,AITA for not wanting to apologize after receiving the Silent treatment without knowing the reason?,"I (F26) have been receiving the silent treatment by two of my three closest friends (F23&22).
To give a little bit of backstory, we met a year and a half ago. Girl 1 and girl 2 have been best friends for a long time, meanwhile girl 2 and girl 3 are in a serious relationship.
When they wanted for me to join their group, I felt grateful, since I moved from another city and struggled to make friends. 

We shared a lot of amazing memories, we went to concerts togheter and did a lot of cool stuff! 
Everything went well up until February of 2024, when Girl 3 and I ended up arguing. 

She was mad because of me seeing a K-Pop idol during FW and not disclosing directly with her some info, mainly bc I was working that day. 
Meanwhile on my side, I was mad due to the lack of communication, mainly because Girl 2 apparently was sick and she had to go to the hospital and most people around me knew it but I wasn’t told. 

That time as well I received the silent treatment for three weeks, and I was triggered so badly due to the fact that my dad used that when he was mad at me, that I had to text girl 3 and solve it.

And we did. We decided to put everything behind. 

Then, we met up , along our friend group, at the beginning of April due to an event.
Things went well, since I wasn’t too involved emotionally into it and followed my friends around 99% of the time.

And now, for a month I am once again receiving the silent treatment from Girl 3 and as default from Girl 2 as well. 
I texted a friend of ours in the group that we have in common and she told me that, apparently I did something, and she wants me to text Girl 3 so that I can “apologize” for what I did?

Honestly, the lack of communication and the silent treatment are enough for me for not wanting to apologize, mainly if I don’t know what the hell I did.

91,1cn1qq9,AITA - should I have let this woman sing?,"So last night as I’m DJing, a woman comes over to me and asks me if I do the sound. I say yes I’m the resident dj and booked and then she says that she's 10 million times better than the vocalist from the house band who was on just before me and that her music is so much better and introduces herself.

It tells me she's just been signed to a very big record label and I commented that that was a little bit weird that the first thing she said is that the singer that was on right now is really is not that great.

She comes back to me she apologizes she says I'm so sorry I offended you and I said look I wasn't offended I just still think it was an odd way to start the conversation but it’s very awkward.

Later I'm at the bar and I'm just stood waiting for a drink and I'm not even drinking alcohol. She starts like putting her finger in her face and then she says something about how difficult it's been for her because she's a 39 year old woman then she starts making some comment about her ass and she's like look at my ass does this ass look like something and I just kept staring eyes forward uh and not and I literally said out loud I am not looking.

Later, she makes her way back to me where she says that she'd love to sing and she really wants to sing one of her songs - I spoke to your sales guy he says I can do it - so I said look why don't you ask him to come over and tell me that and then I will figure it out.

I go talk to our sales guy and I was like hey did you ok the singer? he's said definitely not. We both agreed she was acting weird.

I go back to the DJ booth then her friend comes up to me and apologizes on behalf of her and we talk about it for like five mins.

The band finishes and I’m talking to two beautiful women and she comes again and interrupts my convo and she says I'm sorry again and I'm going and she kind of goes in for kind of like to touch my shoulder or whatever kind of just like like a hug touch but it wasn't prompted and I just kind of pulled away and I said sorry I just don't really enjoy being touched it's not personal I just don’t know you.

She gave me this look like I’d killed someone. Also I forgot to mention during our interactions she'd also come up to me at one point and just started like sticking her tongue out in my face and pointing her finger in my face like very close to my nose like her finger was like one inch away from my nose she was like wagging her tongue at me at one point doing all these weird things.

She didn't even she didn't even leave at that point she still hung around for like another 20 or 30 minutes. Am I the asshole here? I was working and I obviously have to maintain professionalism.

I heard her music this morning. It was absolutely not what I would ever listen to willingly. I also heard the unreleased ep she sent me and equally bad or not my taste. She had only 4k monthly listeners but one song did have 2m plays. Maybe just not my taste.

Am I the asshole here for not letting her sing?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-08,"AITA - should I have let this woman sing? So last night as I’m DJing, a woman comes over to me and asks me if I do the sound. I say yes I’m the resident dj and booked and then she says that she's 10 million times better than the vocalist from the house band who was on just before me and that her music is so much better and introduces herself.

It tells me she's just been signed to a very big record label and I commented that that was a little bit weird that the first thing she said is that the singer that was on right now is really is not that great.

She comes back to me she apologizes she says I'm so sorry I offended you and I said look I wasn't offended I just still think it was an odd way to start the conversation but it’s very awkward.

Later I'm at the bar and I'm just stood waiting for a drink and I'm not even drinking alcohol. She starts like putting her finger in her face and then she says something about how difficult it's been for her because she's a 39 year old woman then she starts making some comment about her ass and she's like look at my ass does this ass look like something and I just kept staring eyes forward uh and not and I literally said out loud I am not looking.

Later, she makes her way back to me where she says that she'd love to sing and she really wants to sing one of her songs - I spoke to your sales guy he says I can do it - so I said look why don't you ask him to come over and tell me that and then I will figure it out.

92,1cn1h9o,AITA for telling my sister someone made fun of her when they didn't,"I know the title may sound bad but I promise I had a good reason. My sister and I (both 16F) are twins and because of that we share a lot of similar interests and have similar taste. Unfortunately that includes our taste in romance options. Where we mostly differ is our personalities, my sister, let's call her Jenna for simplicity, is the type of person who always goes for what she wants, no matter what, while I'm the opposite and I usually don't speak up about what I want because I don't want to be a burden to others. Because of that, Jenna is usually in the spotlight and I am in her shadow. I don't like being the centre of attention so I'm mostly okay with that arrangement. However, like I mentioned before, we have the same taste in romantic partners. So it often happens that Jenna has a crush on the same person I do, and when she does she makes a move on them and they of course pick her and don't even notice me. Now a couple years ago when we were like 12 I had a crush on this girl, I'll call her Andrea in this post, and I really didn't want my sister to make a move on her. Then one day Jenna made a comment about me being obsessed with Andrea. I really didn't want Jenna to know about my crush because I thought it would make her see Andrea in a more romantic light and she'd steal my crush from me again, so in the heat of the moment I made up a lie and told Jenna that Andrea made fun of her mental illness and told the whole school about it and because of that I could never be obsessed with her. (For context Jenna is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) 

As I mentioned this was like 4 years ago but recently it became relevant again. A couple weeks ago I actually became closer friends with Andrea and we started hanging out more. As a result of that Jenna and Andrea (who since then didn't get along at all) have been seeing each other more often and eventually they started fighting. During the fight the situation came up and well they somehow figured out that I lied. They both seemed pretty upset at me for doing this so now I'm questioning if I'm the asshole in this situation. I know what I did wasn't the best but I was a kid with a crush who wanted to have one thing for herself so I don't think I'm that much in the wrong here but I'm open to hear everyone else's opinon's.

I'm (24F) an undergraduate student trying to complete my thesis. I don't have classes to go to or grades to make up for so my schedule technically is pretty free.

Additionally, I've also planned to hang out with a guy I've been talking to. He's a high school classmate I recently reconnected with who lives in City One. We've planned for his visit to where I am, City Two, since 2 weeks ago. He's already booked travel and accommodations for this weekend.

The dilemma: my older sister Anna got into an accident last Saturday. She was treated in my hometown, City Three but after finding out that there was internal bleeding and a tumor my parents referred her to a better hospital in City Four. She went into surgery yesterday, and thank everything that's holy she's been recovering well so far. My dad called me earlier this morning to ask if my other siblings and I (who all live in City Two) would come visit Anna at the hospital. He reasoned that since Friday will be a national holiday and City Four is closer to City Two, it'll be easier to visit Anna now instead of after her discharge as my parents plan to let her recover at our home in City Three.

As the second oldest, I feel an extra responsibility to be there for Anna and help with my parents as well. But I've been excited for all of the other plans I've made for this weekend and don't want to cancel them.

95,1cn0eua,AITA for accusing my husband of treating me like the hired help instead of his wife in front of his family?,"I (34f) have been married to my husband for 4 years, together for 7.5 years and we have two children (2.5 and 5 months). My husband was married before we met. He and his ex-wife separated during her pregnancy with their daughter (13) and divorced after she turned 1.

To my stepdaughter I am dad's wife. I'm okay with that. We get along fine, mostly. She does struggle to be left with me in charge. My husband knows this. We have discussed this at length. We have worked together to figure out solutions. We even talked with his ex, who is okay with me being around her daughter (I know some aren't) but did not like the idea of her daughter being with me if she could be with her (they don't have a right of first refusal and didn't get it added after this discussion). And generally didn't love that I would be in a parent role if alone with her kid. She has a very big dislike of the idea of stepparents becoming just parents and she has never wanted her daughter to view me as any kind of mother figure. So discussions were had and agreements were made.

Onto our issue: My husband always has a very busy period of work in June/July and he's basically just home to sleep and nothing else. In June his ex is having surgery and will be out of commission and in the hospital for some time. The ex's surgery was not mentioned to me at all. But Saturday night while we were at my ILs house, my husband started venting about his ex's surgery and her not wanting their daughter to be in my care all day and his daughter not wanting to have me in charge of her that much, and how he told them I would be doing it and nothing they said or did would change this.

He was pissed at his ex and his daughter a little for having such a dislike for me being in charge even though we get along fine. I asked him when all this happened and he said it had been a few days. He told me she would be with ""us"" from June 6th until July 4th and possibly longer. That he was already told he will need to work most Saturdays in June and July. So he told me I'd need to figure out how to best deal with that. I asked him why he sprung this on me in front of his family instead of discussing it privately. He waved me off and said he knew I wouldn't say no because I love my stepdaughter and I understand that she needs to be with an adult. He saw an expression on my face and told me I couldn't be pissed about it when I know my stepdaughter is still a kid. I told him I wasn't pissed at her. I was pissed at him. He told me he can't help his ex and his daughter being somewhat unreasonable. MIL chimed in and offered to take my stepdaughter during the daytime for June. He told her I would handle it, she should be with ""us"". This is when I accused him of treating me like the hired help and not his wife because he wasn't discussing it with me and was making decision for me without asking or discussing things through.

It was afterward he told me I shouldn't speak to him like that in front of his family.

96,1cn02c4,AITA for kicking out my roommate over chocolate?,"Hey Reddit! 
I (22f) have been sharing an apartment with my best friend (21f) - let's call her Lisa - for about 2½.
It was a dream living with Lisa, since we get along super well and almost never fight with each other, but last weekend Lisa screwed up big time:
She left half a bar of raisin chocolate openly lying around our apartment despite me reminding her to put it away after she is done eating.

The reason that is such a big deal for me is because my dog Abby also lives with us in our shared apartment. Lisa never had a problem with Abby, she actually loved cuddling with her and taking walks with her when I was sick or too busy.

I was at my family's place on Saturday and got a call from Lisa. She was panicked and told me that Abby had eaten the raisin chocolate Lisa had left on the living room table (it's a very low table, easily accessable for Abby) and that I needed to come home right away, because Abby appeared to be cramping. Abby is not a huge dog, by any means (she is a Sheltie) so a little bit of chocolate can go a long way for her.

I think I was constantly above the speed limit on my way back home, grabbed Abby and instantly rushed to the vet with her. She was conscious but clearly in a bad condition. I had to leave her at the pet clinic for 2 nights and was terrified, but fortunately she didn't die.

When Abby was at the clinic, I drove home and as soon as I opened the door Lisa stormed at me apologizing profusely and asking about Abby. I know I may have acted a bit out of line here, but I was so frustrated, scared and upset that I just started shouting at Lisa and berating her for leaving the chocolate there accessible for Abby, even though I reminded her to put it away.
I told her that I couldn't risk Abby living with someone like her and that I wanted her out of the apartment for a while until I got a grip on the situation and Abby was okay.

Lisa called me an asshole for kicking her out like that and said things like: ""I thought we were friends!"" and told me I was severely overreacting, but she almost killed my dog and it could have easily been prevented had she been a little more careful or at least listened to me.

Our shared friends and familys obviously heard about this issue and most of them told me I am a drama queen, I'm overreacting and that valuing my dog more than my friendship with Lisa is a b*tch move on my end.

97,1cmzvr3,AITA for telling my paternal grandparents to fuck off and to stop trying to make my mom responsible for their son's kid?,"My parents marriage ended 5 years ago when my mom found out my dad was cheating on her and got the other woman pregnant. Dad didn't want his cheating to end the marriage and he offered not to be in the baby's life if mom would stay or he offered to find a way for them to raise the baby together. Dad tried to rope my siblings (17m and 15f) and I (18f) into his little shitshow and was disappointed when we all said no. I stopped seeing dad after that because I told the courts I wanted my mom to have custody, my siblings saw dad for a couple of years before they could declare a lack of interest in going and the courts listened. In that time dad had moved in with the affair partner but tried to use my siblings to get mom and him back together. They didn't want that to happen and mom was furious at him for using the kids. His youngest daughter was born around that time. I never met her but my siblings did, though they never formed a relationship with her.

Dad's affair partner left and hasn't been a part of his daughter's life since.

Dad died 14 weeks ago. His daughter went to live with my paternal grandparents who we don't really see because they were angry at mom for the divorce and they felt we were too hard on dad, who didn't just cheat but tried to use his kids to keep his marriage together. Like a week after my dad's death my paternal grandparents reached out to mom and asked her to raise dad's daughter as her own. My mom said no and that should have been the end but it wasn't and it is boarding on harassment now but it isn't there yet according to the officer and lawyer mom spoke to.

My paternal grandparents went on a character assassination of mom and told her that if she doesn't take their granddaughter this poor little girl will grow up with no parents and no siblings because clearly we have no intention of being there for her. They told mom their granddaughter should be part of our (mine and siblings) family and life and we should be part of hers. Mom said that she wasn't going to force us and she told them it did not mean she would raise her late ex-husband's child from his affair. They called my mom selfish, heartless, evil, spawn of the devil and all kinds of insults. Which has been going on for weeks. My mom has blocked them but they always find another way to contact her.

I reached the end of my rope when they started publicly talking about my mom letting her children's half siblings go into foster care and how heartless she was because she told everyone we wanted her with us. I confronted them and told them to fuck right off and stop trying to make mom responsible for their cheating son's kid. I said he was a terrible person and mom did not have to do a thing for his child and they had zero right to harass her to take responsibility.

They were so offended and angry and told me I had no right to be so disrespectful to them.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-08,"AITA for telling my paternal grandparents to fuck off and to stop trying to make my mom responsible for their son's kid? My parents marriage ended 5 years ago when my mom found out my dad was cheating on her and got the other woman pregnant. Dad didn't want his cheating to end the marriage and he offered not to be in the baby's life if mom would stay or he offered to find a way for them to raise the baby together. Dad tried to rope my siblings (17m and 15f) and I (18f) into his little shitshow and was disappointed when we all said no. I stopped seeing dad after that because I told the courts I wanted my mom to have custody, my siblings saw dad for a couple of years before they could declare a lack of interest in going and the courts listened. In that time dad had moved in with the affair partner but tried to use my siblings to get mom and him back together. They didn't want that to happen and mom was furious at him for using the kids. His youngest daughter was born around that time. I never met her but my siblings did, though they never formed a relationship with her.

Dad's affair partner left and hasn't been a part of his daughter's life since.

Dad died 14 weeks ago. His daughter went to live with my paternal grandparents who we don't really see because they were angry at mom for the divorce and they felt we were too hard on dad, who didn't just cheat but tried to use his kids to keep his marriage together. Like a week after my dad's death my paternal grandparents reached out to mom and asked her to raise dad's daughter as her own. My mom said no and that should have been the end but it wasn't and it is boarding on harassment now but it isn't there yet according to the officer and lawyer mom spoke to.

My paternal grandparents went on a character assassination of mom and told her that if she doesn't take their granddaughter this poor little girl will grow up with no parents and no siblings because clearly we have no intention of being there for her. They told mom their granddaughter should be part of our (mine and siblings) family and life and we should be part of hers. Mom said that she wasn't going to force us and she told them it did not mean she would raise her late ex-husband's child from his affair. They called my mom selfish, heartless, evil, spawn of the devil and all kinds of insults. Which has been going on for weeks. My mom has blocked them but they always find another way to contact her.

I reached the end of my rope when they started publicly talking about my mom letting her children's half siblings go into foster care and how heartless she was because she told everyone we wanted her with us. I confronted them and told them to fuck right off and stop trying to make mom responsible for their cheating son's kid. I said he was a terrible person and mom did not have to do a thing for his child and they had zero right to harass her to take responsibility.

They were so offended and angry and told me I had no right to be so disrespectful to them.

98,1cmzqlp,AITA for letting a kid stay up 20 minutes past his bedtime?,"My(16m) dad’s company imports kitchen machinery and bakery equipment. from Europe. One of his suppliers(coffee machine) came to our country, along with his son(9). They asked me to babysit the kid in the afternoon and evening, and make sure he goes to bed at 8:30. It is one of the reasons my dad hired a tutor for me up until I was 15. He wanted me to speak English reasonably well so I can help him with suppliers and their kids.

Dad gave me his credit card and the supplier told me the kid’s allergies. I took him to have ice cream, then the bookshop, where I bought him a book and one for myself. After that was dinner.

Then I took him back to the hotel where he read his book. He was getting ready for bed when his mom called. It was 8:20. I figured it would be a short call.

She heard that we have heatwaves in our country and asked the kid if he was staying hydrated and applying sunscreen when outside. Once he said yes and told her he’s with his babysitter, she had him put me on the phone. She asked if her husband told me the allergies and I said yes. Then she had me put the kid back on the phone.

Kid ended up going to bed at 8:50.

When I told my dad’s supplier how everything went he wasn’t happy with me. I said I thought it’s okay since the kid was talking to his mom/the guy’s wife but he said ‘I gave you instructions. She didn’t. You ignored what I said.’

UPDATE : I talked to the supplier and told him I understand he is the kid’s dad and has parental authority, but the kid’s mom is also a parent and it would’ve been extremely inappropriate to tell them to end their conversation, regardless of the instruction I got from him.

During this phone call it was right at the end of my work day and I was leaving to pick up the kids from daycare, my father’s open heart surgery was entering the fifth hour and we were told it could be an hour more. I was getting frequent updates from my mom and aunt who were at the hospital together. I was exhausted, distracted and honestly stressed.

She would talk to me about this past relationship she once had with a guy named Lane. She would then go on to tell me about how Lane had even recently bought her nails for and even met Lane at his work behind Todd’s back.
Fast forward a couple weeks later, they all become friends. Terry, Todd, Julie (Lanes wife), and Lane. I was told that Julie didn't know anything about Lane and Terry's past relationship and it was a secret.
One Friday night, I decided to try shrooms. Long story short, I didn't like my trip and called Terry to talk to her. Terry wasat Lane and Julie's house. She went to the bathroom to let me talk to her. The next day I asked Terry if anyone knew why I had called her and she reassured me that nobody knew. I was embarrassed. 
Terry tells me about how Lane had bought her valentines flowers. The flowers were bigger than the ones he got his wife.
A month later, Terry tells me that she's not friends with Julie anymore and she tells us that her and Todd are pregnant.
Fast forward to yesterday. Julie had come up to me and let me know that my name was brought up when Terry was at their house. She goes on to tell me her side of the story of why they stopped being friends. She said that Terry had recorded a video of their conversation when Terry brought up body counts. Terry then took that video and sent it to Lane. No matter what was said she denied everything even with the proof. And I know Julie's telling the truth because I heard the same story, just the version that made Terry's side look better. She then tells me that while at her house (the night of the shroom), she openly made fun of me to everyone there including the other guests that were over as well. And said that she hated hanging out with us because all we want to do is party and liked hanging with them because of the card games they play.

Gf wants to go away on vacations regularly. I’m okay doing stuff for my gf, it’s important for her, we go. But I cannot stay more than 4 days, I can’t leave my cat alone. (I always have someone come and feed her, but I do not like to leave her alone and just have someone once a day coming, put a bowl of food and leave). She’s on meds as she was hospitalised last year, and doesn’t let other give her pills so if I leave she doesn’t take them.

This month, my gf suggested that we take Wiskers with us, so we can stay more. I said why not try? We can stay longer and they both might be happy. So we did. 

The boat trip was kinda hard for my cat but we made it. Went to my gf’s summer house, stayed there with 2 friends. All of us had a great time. (I thought) We came back. All was good until my gf started yelling. Said we cannot continue like that. Said when we were there I only had my mind on my cat and didn’t pay attention to anything. 

I reminded her of all the things I did. Make food, suggest board games, having laughs, taking care of friends that got sick, mixing drinks. Overall vacation stuff. Of course I had one eye out for my cat to be fine, AND to not mess with gf’s mums furniture. I participated to every activity and initiated many. Never being rude to anyone. Tought our friends to play chess and make desserts cause they wanted and it was my pleasure. These things can’t be done if you’re not there. 

But she says it was her last effort and if I don’t do something she won’t have it. Said it’s not healthy how much I care. I’ve told her I don’t see anything wrong and I had a good time and didn’t feel uneasy. She got even more mad. She cries and yells and left the house yesterday. I need someone to tell me AITA here?

104,1cmyppn,AITA 23f for not lending my bf 28m my car if i’m not using it?,"this is my first vehicle (28k), i plan to pay it off within the next month. i’m currently deployed in the desert. i store my car on base where my sgt minimally starts it.

pros of leaving it on base: minimal risk (theft, break in, accidents, fewer mileage) 

this has been my plan for every deployment and what i’m comfortable with.

my bf got into an accident (his fault). after a phone call he texts me asking why i didn’t offer my vehicle. i told him that i’m more comfortable leaving it on base and that i didn’t offer because there wasn’t a timeline of when and how long he would need my car for. 

this was his follow up text:

Oh okay, well idk how long my truck is going to be in the shop for. Kinda doesn’t matter, because that’s the only ride that I have. 

But no worries. Just thought I would ask. 


the next day our conversation picks back up, and i asked him if he was upset at me for not offering my car. he started being passive aggressive with me over text and when i told him that he was he denied it. i told him that i wasn’t willing to accept the risk. my answer changed from being: although im not comfortable we can talk about it when there’s more details to flat out i’m not comfortable with this anymore based on how he was reacting. 

he told me that he didn’t feel entitled to my vehicle, he was forced to lie to his friends to save me and the relationship from embarrassment, and was hurt that i didn’t appreciate how he was dishonest to his closest friends. 

we have a phone call to try and clear the air, he kept saying that i needed to figure out what i valued more. my vehicle or him. i offered money for the situation  and he didn’t acknowledge it. it turned into if the roles were reversed that he would do it for me and that meant i don’t love him as much as he does me.  

i offered money because i’m more comfortable doing that than lending my car out. i wasn’t trying to kick him while he’s down as he’d like to call it. if he got into an accident with my vehicle i would be paying for the damage up front since he’s tight on money and that really offended him. accidents happen, he got in one! his response to this is that i don’t trust him as my boyfriend to use my car. 

this would be all different if i was back home. i have no problem coordinating down to one vehicle, but in no way am i comfortable with having him use my car for 4 months. 

is it fair that i changed my decision based on his responses? is it fair bringing love into this?

i’m just very confused. it feels to me that he’s trying to manipulate me to get his way, but is that what’s actually going on here? 

this happened two weeks ago. he broke up with me a couple days after this all happened but still wants this conversation to be resolved. we’ve still been talking and both parties are hurt.

we have a phone call to try and clear the air, he kept saying that i needed to figure out what i valued more. my vehicle or him. i offered money for the situation  and he didn’t acknowledge it. it turned into if the roles were reversed that he would do it for me and that meant i don’t love him as much as he does me.  

i offered money because i’m more comfortable doing that than lending my car out. i wasn’t trying to kick him while he’s down as he’d like to call it. if he got into an accident with my vehicle i would be paying for the damage up front since he’s tight on money and that really offended him. accidents happen, he got in one! his response to this is that i don’t trust him as my boyfriend to use my car. 

this would be all different if i was back home. i have no problem coordinating down to one vehicle, but in no way am i comfortable with having him use my car for 4 months. 

is it fair that i changed my decision based on his responses? is it fair bringing love into this?

i’m just very confused. it feels to me that he’s trying to manipulate me to get his way, but is that what’s actually going on here? 

this happened two weeks ago. he broke up with me a couple days after this all happened but still wants this conversation to be resolved. we’ve still been talking and both parties are hurt.

part of me wants to walk away for good because of how disrespected i feel. another part of me wants to make it work because i love him.",0.0,0.0012329013552516699,0,1
105,1cmyou6,AITA for not letting my husband name our son Walter after his recently deceased grandfather?,"My husband and I are expecting our son in 6 weeks. We're not 100% set on a name yet but ever since my husband's grandfather died several weeks ago, my husband has wanted us to name our son Walter in his memory. As a middle name I'm fine with using Walter because he meant so much to my husband but to me also. But I really don't like the name Walter. I find it too old fashioned for me, too much of an older man name and I could never be happy with it used as a first name. The name isn't typically my husbands style either so when he first brought it up I asked him to sit with the name for a while. But he did and he told me that for family names, he doesn't really care about his personal feelings on a name or whether they fit what he likes. For him a name connected to such a special person is special without being a favorite or one you would normally pick.

My husband has a family name. He was named after his late uncle who passed away as a child. So my husband doesn't have an issue with family names as first names. I bring this up because I know using an honor name as a first name is not for everyone. My husband has never seen a problem with it himself.

I told my husband I couldn't do Walter as a first name but suggested it could be our son's middle name. He asked me why and I told him the name wasn't for me. He asked me if the nickname Wally would bring me around and I said no. He was disappointed and told me he needed time but he accepted I didn't want to.

We went to dinner with his family a few nights ago and MIL brought up our son's name and she made the assumption that our son would be Walter Jedediah (Jedediah after my late grandfather). I told her neither name was in the running as a first name. The family asked my husband how he felt about that given the reasoning passing of Grandpa Walter and he told them he'd be fine and that the name is something we should both agree on. His family didn't like that though and told me I had a way for us both to be included and if I really had to be the deciding vote it could be Jedidiah Walter but I should think of my husband. My husband told them to stop interfering and I had already offered to make Walter the middle name. It was obvious he still wasn't over us not using the name as a first with his tone but he was making an effort to stop his family pressing me. Still, I saw and heard his disappointment and his family made a point of saying I should be willing to do this for him. MIL told me FIL did it for her with my husband's name.

Problem is, we split up around the college years. 4-5 years ago. I had probably seen her 4x in those years. When i was pregnant, i asked her to come see me (i was going through a hard time). She never came. I asked her to come to my baby shower… she never came. I asked her if she wanted to come see my son after I gave birth… she never came. 

And I had constantly went up to visit my parents city (the same one she lives in) I’d ask her if I could see her if we could hang out. 

At some point, she stopped answering me. She wouldn’t reply. 

I was super heartbroken. I couldn’t believe my friend of over 12+ years was ignoring me. I thought I did something wrong. But I couldn’t contact her. 

And randomly I get an invitation to her wedding and her sisters birthday. 

Ofc I attend her wedding. However, the whole time I was there I was completely ignored. Her husband didn’t even come say “hi” to me. I understand she was busy, but I didn’t get a hello or anything. I tried to talk to her at her wedding multiple times but she always just smiled at me and went somewhere else.

I have a huge resentment against her. She had ignored me for over 4 years. And my kid is almost 2, and she has never met him. However, another friend of ours is telling me I WBTA if I didn’t invite her to my wedding .

He said that we are finally having new cups to drink out of since the ones we have are ""boring"" looking.When my Mom said that one was only for me to use since she didn't mind everyone drinking out of hers he commented that ""She gets everything that she wants and that's not fair.""

Fast forward to a few days I kept waking up every morning to find my cup missing from my nightstand. That's where I leave it every night after drinking tea out of it. I did not think much of it because usually when dishes are left in the rooms it gets taken down to the kitchen to be washed in the early mornings by whoever is doing the dishes.But I also began to notice that's its never in one of the cupboards that the cups are.

I asked who was using my cup. Nobody knew. I was not mad or anything because my Mom had the same cup and I thought that it was a genuine mistake. As the days progressed my cup was missing from my nightstand everytime I woke up. I never saw anybody drinking out of it.I kept reminding myself to hide it but each time I forgot to do so.

Mine did not have that.He insisted on using MY cup.He has been using my cup this whole time from the day that it was given to me.

111,1cmxfo9,AITA for calling out 2 hours early?,"AITA for “ not calling in sick on time “ ?

I, (20F) work as a bartender at a hotel in Europe, recently I hurt my back lifting a crate and have been trying to just work through it. I toughed it out for three days, before one morning I woke up and the pain was awful, called out and took the day + my day off the next day to try and recover. I came back after my day off, struggled to get through my shift as my back still hurt, had my next day off and that leads us to this morning with the same awful pain. For timing, my shift starts at 9 am, normally I’m up at 6:00-6:30 am to be dressed/commute to my work, and the earliest shift leader/manager gets there at 6:00-6:30 as well. 

Per my handbook, I called my shift leader/manager to report “ well before I start work “ (exactly what it says in the book, no numbers 🤷‍♀️) I called at 6:50 because I was still trying to brute force my way through the pain and get ready. Obviously didn’t work. When my shift leader answers they tell me that I need to give them more notice, as 2 hours is not enough time for them to find a replacement. THIS is where I’m unsure if I’m the asshole.

Every other hospitally job I have worked has said 3-2 hours notice is minimum, and I always call before 7:00 because by then I can tell if I can work or not. All my other shift leaders/managers/ EXECUTIVE MANAGER have not said anything about me not giving enough notice, but the one working today said “ You should try to call the night before, because I can’t find anyone in two hours. “ I just said okay will do and left it at that, but I’ve never heard of having to call so far ahead for being sick? And mind you, I didn’t think I was going to wake up again like this, I thought the pain was lessening 

Keep in mind I’ve seen people ask to go home mid shift because of less serious reasons, one girl left early because her new shoes that she was breaking in chaffed the back of her ankle a bit. And I don’t think 2 hours to find a replacement is an issue, half the servers are cross trained on the bar, and half of the employees live at the hotel. I’ve also seen people come in over an hour late to their shifts because they slept in or forgot, with no write up or discussion. The cherry on top? I’ve worked shifts where someone has called the night before to report sick, and had to bartend and serve the 2nd bar in the hotel which is 2x bigger with only 1 other person because “ they didn’t think we needed an extra person “

116,1cmwnzr,WIBTA If I Started Charging My Female Students For Hygiene Products?,"I am a 37M teacher. I teach History for highschoolers. I keep pads and tampons in my classroom for the girls to use if they need them. This is something I do and have done for all my classes through the years and I pay for them out of my own pocket. But recently, I have gotten an upsurge of female students, making my supplies run low and making me need to restock more often.

So, I have told my students that if they want to use the pads or tampons, they will have to pay a fee of $1 a month if they use the products. I thought it would be a good idea to teach them economics and a basic form of budgeting to them. Well, some parents have come at me via email that this was unfair for them.

Keep in mind, I live near a low-income neighborhood, who have students that mostly depend on me for the products. I explained to them that I have had an upsurge of female students and have told them that their price has gone up and explained that it would not be viable for me to keep doing this. They would keep emailing me, with one parent calling me a d\*ck after school because they can't afford the hygiene products themselves.

I talked this over with my fiancee and she said that it wasn't a bad thing, noting that her products have gotten expensive as well. At the same time however, the principal says this might be a d\*ck move as  the students need these and I should just give it to them free of charge. Now I am reconsidering my decision and have yet to apply the fee. So, WIBTA If I Started Charging My Female Students For Hygiene Products?

Update: After reading many of your comments, I am going to talk to the principal about setting up a caring closet. If he refuses then I will ask for a pay raise to cover for it or just tell him to pay for it out of pocket. I talked this over with the nurse and she said that she would be willing to chip in and would ask around for others. I will keep you guys updated. I am meeting with my principal in 30 minutes, wish me luck!

Second Update: I just finished my meeting with my principal. He did not like the pay raise idea. I told him it would look bad for him if I didn't keep supplying these somehow and he then turned to the caring closet. He said he would need some time to think about it. The nurse said that even if the principal himself doesn't help out, she has 3 other teachers ready to pitch in.

Obviously people shouldn't be forced to follow cultural traditions to a T or even at all, but I'm just stating this for context. 

My aunt's son, my cousin, let's call him C, recently got married in a destination wedding. There were 100+ guests, and these guests had their flights, hotel, etc. all paid for. The guests included C's immediate family (parents and siblings) & a few cousins of C. The majority of the rest of the guests were business contacts of C or influencer-type people. The point is, these guests were not at all intimate close friends of C and his now-wife. It's worth noting that C and his side of the family are very financially well off. 

The extended family was told for months by my aunt that only immediate family was invited (the parents and siblings of C). This was C's decision and not my aunt's. However, we saw that the cousins were invited after the wedding was over. We found out later that these cousins privately messaged C and argued with C, and then C relented.

Most of the extended family is offended that they weren't invited, including my mother, her siblings, my cousins, my grandmother, etc. If C had invited everyone in the extended family, it would have been about 11 additional people. My aunt and C have made comments that lead us to believe we weren't important or connected/rich enough to be invited. 

My aunt has set up a 2nd event locally that we are all invited to. It will supposedly have more focus on cultural ceremonies, but essentially it is a reception. However, she's calling it a wedding. As she's invited us, in our culture, we are obligated to attend and bring relatively expensive gifts. 

My aunt claims she tried and tried convincing C to invite family, but couldn't do anything about it. She says it was his decision. I believe her that she tried. I believe her that this was his C’s decision and that she would have wanted us there. However, my aunt and her husband paid for everything, so I don’t believe she tried as hard as she claims. 

In the meantime, my aunt has sent photos of the destination wedding to group chats, and tried telling us how amazing the wedding was. My extended family hasn't responded or really acknowledged any of the messages.

118,1cmwifi,AITA for not wanting to pay for my friends room upgrade?,"I, female, 25, am in my 1st year of law school. In Aug, I made my way into a friend group of 5 students. We spent A LOT of time together. 5/6 of us decided to go on a spring break trip to Jamaica. We all agreed to go to an all inclusive. So expensive, but law school is all consuming and draining, and so we wanted a trip that involved very little prep.

2 of the girls, Bailey and Nancy found an expedia package. 1 room was put on Bailey’s credit card, and other on mine. Nancy sent a fancy itinerary for the trip. I was shocked and impressed, bc I thought the whole idea was to avoid having to do that kind of prep work, but I hyped her up and thanked her.

When we got to the hotel, Bailey suggested me and the other 2 girls (Amy and Amanda) share a room and she and Nancy take the other. When the 2 person room was ready, Bailey called asking me to send her the receipt. She didn’t give me any details, but said the room wasn’t up to par. I immediately offered to switch rooms. She said they were going to talk to the front desk again, and I said to let me know if I could help. When we saw Bailey and Nancy again, they said the room was switched but that they had to pay more. Amanda threw out “oh we should all split the cost of that,” but no one said anything. I figured if Amanda wanted to offer some money to their room that was her business. 

I get this text post-trip: “As we talked about during the trip, we paid an additional $400 for the room. Everyone agreed that we should split it, so it will be $80 per person.” 

On Mon, I pulled Bailey aside. I started by saying that I really appreciated all the work she and Nancy put into the trip, and that it was a great time, and that I really valued her friendship, but the $80 made me uncomfy bc it was a lot on an already expensive trip, and I never actually agreed. From her POV, she said that the room issue came up twice - when Amanda said it, and on our 2nd night at dinner, they brought it up again and no one gave an AFFIRMATIVE NO, so she and Nancy took that as AGREEMENT bc she and Nancy had made so many other decisions on the trip, so the same must apply here. 

she kept on hitting on how much work she and Nancy put into the trip, and how everyone else wasn’t making decisions. She asked if I didn’t think she deserved a nice room/at least insinuated it. At 1 point she really went hard on the point “Amanda offered to split the cost the 1st time bc she saw I was annoyed about it, and I thought that was very KIND and CONSIDERATE” (obviously trying to imply that I wasn’t.) She was mad I didn’t bring this up when it was brought up in Jamaica. I tried to stand for my POV, while taking accountability- I acknowledged how much work she and Nancy put in, that I didn’t think they deserved a bad room, that if I missed the 2nd time payment was brought up that was my bad.

Although he is looking for jobs, he rarely gets responses it seems- until I am the one helping him look for work, and when I do he always gets a response but does not always follow through on his end (making the interview, ect.)

123,1cmvvxl,AITA For Telling A Guy I Don’t  Feel A Romantic Vibe Between Us? ,"I (F53) received a message from a not so close friend (M54) asking me to go to a baseball game. I accepted. We went to the game enjoyed ourselves and then hit a wine tasting. The last wine, a house specialty, had tobasco sauce in it. Sounds gross but since I’d never had it, I was in. Unfortunately this made me sick on the way home. I told him I was feeling sick and when we got to my house I was going to jump out and run inside and I did just that. I barely made it before getting violently ill. He asked me later if I’d gotten sick and if I was ok. I told him I did get sick but didn’t really want to talk about it as I was embarrassed. 
He then began texting and calling me multiple times per day. He asked me out to a business dinner. I declined because that is a wife or significant other thing and not a 2nd date. Next he asked me to dinner and a hockey game. 
We again had a good time, but weird things started happening. He had informed me he’d been “stalking” me on social media for the past 10 yrs and at first I took it as a joke. Later though I realized he remembered a lot of things about me that I wouldn’t have expected. For example I have a yearly theme. This year it’s unstoppable. A few years back it was “Learning to be happy alone”. While I wasn’t quite sure of the year, he remembered it spot on. He also told me to get my passport ready because he was going to take me to Mexico where he has a vacation home. 
While sitting next to him, all of a sudden I see his hand coming towards the side of my head. It was weird and a bit freaky. He told me he wanted to touch my hair. 
After this date I hugged him, thanked him and went inside. 
Still he’s calling and texting me A LOT. I decided the next day  since I wasn’t really feeling a romantic vibe that I should tell him. I sent a text as I thought that apprapo since we’d only had 2 dates. I explained that I wasn’t feelin a romantic connection between us, that he was a great guy, funny, intelligent, etc… and that I didn’t want to keep him tied up with me while he could be finding his soulmate. I also said I valued his friendship and hoped we could remain friends. 
I got back a not so nice text in which he told me I was too busy to be dating, I’d dodged into my house when he dropped me off (ok well I didn’t want to puke on you the 1st time), I sent this text instead of calling him, he is “too nice and kind for my type” (whatever TF that means), we could still be friends but we’d go Dutch from now on and I’m amazing. I did not respond. 
By then next day I decided I didn’t really want to remain connected to someone who responds with insults so I unfriended him on social media. He noticed within 5 min and blocked me.

I (F53) received a message from a not so close friend (M54) asking me to go to a baseball game. I accepted. We went to the game enjoyed ourselves and then hit a wine tasting. The last wine, a house specialty, had tobasco sauce in it. Sounds gross but since I’d never had it, I was in. Unfortunately this made me sick on the way home. I told him I was feeling sick and when we got to my house I was going to jump out and run inside and I did just that. I barely made it before getting violently ill. He asked me later if I’d gotten sick and if I was ok. I told him I did get sick but didn’t really want to talk about it as I was embarrassed. 
He then began texting and calling me multiple times per day. He asked me out to a business dinner. I declined because that is a wife or significant other thing and not a 2nd date. Next he asked me to dinner and a hockey game. 
We again had a good time, but weird things started happening. He had informed me he’d been “stalking” me on social media for the past 10 yrs and at first I took it as a joke. Later though I realized he remembered a lot of things about me that I wouldn’t have expected. For example I have a yearly theme. This year it’s unstoppable. A few years back it was “Learning to be happy alone”. While I wasn’t quite sure of the year, he remembered it spot on. He also told me to get my passport ready because he was going to take me to Mexico where he has a vacation home. 
While sitting next to him, all of a sudden I see his hand coming towards the side of my head. It was weird and a bit freaky. He told me he wanted to touch my hair. 
After this date I hugged him, thanked him and went inside. 
Still he’s calling and texting me A LOT. I decided the next day  since I wasn’t really feeling a romantic vibe that I should tell him. I sent a text as I thought that apprapo since we’d only had 2 dates. I explained that I wasn’t feelin a romantic connection between us, that he was a great guy, funny, intelligent, etc… and that I didn’t want to keep him tied up with me while he could be finding his soulmate. I also said I valued his friendship and hoped we could remain friends. 
I got back a not so nice text in which he told me I was too busy to be dating, I’d dodged into my house when he dropped me off (ok well I didn’t want to puke on you the 1st time), I sent this text instead of calling him, he is “too nice and kind for my type” (whatever TF that means), we could still be friends but we’d go Dutch from now on and I’m amazing. I did not respond.

127,1cmvktu,AITA for not offering to help my mom with chores?,"I'm a 23yr old(F) who has been living with my mom since I graduated college last year in 2023. My mom and I have had multiple fights over chores, and I feel like I’m going in circles with her. My mom, who's from the baby boomer generation, keeps saying I have to offer help around the house with all kinds of chores, but won’t give examples or a list. 

She says she shouldn’t have to ask, and wants me to offer help whenever she sees fit even if it conflicts with my pre-established plans. If I see her doing yard work, I won’t go out of my way to offer if she needs help because we live our separate lives. I'm not messy at all. I clean my dishes, wash my sheets, clean my bathroom and always pick up after myself. I spend most of my time in my room because my mom and I don’t see eye to eye. Here are some example my mom thinks I can read her mind: 

Example 1: In December my parents were shoveling only small amounts of snow. I didn’t know they were shoveling cause I was upstairs working from home. I walked downstairs around the evening and saw my dad come out of the garage and said  “maybe you can come help out if you want” they always put a “maybe” and “if you want” and not a definite “help me out please”. I went outside to shovel only to find out they’re basically done and then my mom got angry cause I didn’t offer to help but didn’t even know they were shoveling snow until I went downstairs and saw them outside. They didn’t communicate at all. My older brother, 27, who also lives in the house, also got involved. He was at the gym at the time and my mom was like you didn’t ask for help to the both of us. We basically didn’t know they were shoveling until they finally asked for our help and they were already almost done with shoveling.

Example 2: I was at the kitchen table eating, when my mom entered with groceries, my dad came downstairs to assist her. I asked my dad, “Do you need any help?” to which he replied, “No, I think we’re good.” I remained at the kitchen table. However, 10 minutes later, my mom complained about how I didn’t offer her any help. This turned into a heated argument once again. I told her I did offer help, I asked dad if you guys needed help. To which she said she didn’t know that, but next time she wanted me to ask her instead of my dad. It's quite confusing dealing with her, as she is inconsistent half the time. 

Example 3: Currently, my brother also disagrees with my mom. He thinks SHE should ask us to help because it’s basic communication. When we were younger she always asked us to do chores, since we are older she expects us to have to ask her? We also had this conversation before and she said she would make a chore list but never did. This whole “I always have to offer” doesn’t make any sense to me.

128,1cmvkm3,WIBTA for not fixing college dorm room situation because of the actions of my friend group?,"Context: our college allows four students to room together in a quad assignment where two shared rooms are connected to a small, shared living room. My GF and my friends (fake names Jess and Ava) plan to share a quad room w/ me. Directly after finals week ended, two friends Ann and Toni blocked my GF.

I thought Jess and Ava were not part of the issue with my GF and I thought it would not affect anything with them however Jess called me asking to break the quad agreement and either dissolve the agreement and all move to doubles with it being me + GF and Jess + Ava or switch out my GF and me for Ann and our friend Sue.

Going into all this I have had a recent family death, a family members college graduation, another family members important low-risk long recovery surgery, summer college classes, and two jobs with not a lot of extra time to emotionally recover.

Originally, I was ok with the switch roommate alternative given the way that my friend Jess presented it but as the situation has unfolded it has left a sour taste in my mouth. Ann has been central to the original drama between my GF and the group and instead of talking to her they have decided to ghost her and only let the animosity be known after we all left campus for summer break. I have been talking with my friends to find out what is needed to switch rooms. Ann and Sue are adamant that we need to have this all figured out this summer before fall. The only reason we have the room is because my GF is upper classman and got to pick rooms early, Ann has said hurtful things to my GF, and Sue has been very inconsiderate to our situation.

If we wait till the fall we will have to wait two weeks before room switching is allowed and will not be immediately able to change the roommate situation but I also don’t want to put in the time and energy necessary to email back and forth with our understaffed res life team to get everyone’s permission and understanding on who will room with who in what room in the fall right now. Without my GF there would be no quad and Ann wouldn't have even had the chance to be in it in the first place if it wasn't for the drama.

Sue and Jess have stated that they can be the ones contacting the res life but they would still need to correspond with everyone.

I am basically the black sheep of my family I am only one who I would say is upper/middle middle class out of my siblings when i hangout with them everyone always ask if i can pick up the tab in public knowing i have social anxiety and people pleaser. One time couple years ago  either one of my siblings or Suzanne stole over 2k from my bank because I got engaged to my spouse and didnt help my family out financially anymore but only person ik didn't do it was kimmy cause she was living somewhere else at the time. I did try to forgive them about it months later and let them live with us short time until drama happened and I kicked them out. 

I moved far away for everyone trying to get away from drama. I haven't really talked to her in few years expect at funerals and like one or two text a year. My spouse said we should try to see if she change and give her a shot at being a grandmother to our child. I asked Suzanne multiple times before to say sorry to my spouse for everything she said about them during text, on social media, and in person but she still hasn't. My spouse said to forget about the apology and focus on family but i know since growing up she never apologizes for anything she did that hurt one of her childern and i had enough but i did listen to my spouse and said okay. There was a recent event where I was hanging out with siblings and Suzanne was on the phone. I didn't say a word to her but I did let her talk to my child for few minutes. Later on that night my siblings was arguing with each other and I offered to help the situation which meant I had to contact Suzanne but when I tried to contact Suzanne she didn't pick up the phone instead she went to my sibling (we can say kyle) and talked shit about me to Kyle because i didnt forgive her . Kyle then told me and I was shocked that Suzanne was acting like a high schooler and didn't just come straight to me instead she talks rudely about her child to one of her other child.

There was a recent event where I was hanging out with siblings and Suzanne was on the phone. I didn't say a word to her but I did let her talk to my child for few minutes. Later on that night my siblings was arguing with each other and I offered to help the situation which meant I had to contact Suzanne but when I tried to contact Suzanne she didn't pick up the phone instead she went to my sibling (we can say kyle) and talked shit about me to Kyle because i didnt forgive her . Kyle then told me and I was shocked that Suzanne was acting like a high schooler and didn't just come straight to me instead she talks rudely about her child to one of her other child. Later that night I called my spouse telling them what happened and say I tried to be nice and bite my tongue but I don't feel comfortable with suzzane around our child even if it is social media. We have a family event where all of us are invited to would I be an a$$h0le if I kept our daughter at home with my spouse while I go to this event? I just feel like there will be drama there but I do want to see my other family.

132,1cmv5mf,AITA for refusing to try deer sausage and starting an argument - throw away,"Throwaway account on mobile. Married to my husband 14 years. 2 children. 

I don’t think I am a terribly picky eater. There a few things I don’t like- fish, beans (they have a chalky texture), boiled peanuts and I cannot stand deer meat. My husband knows I don’t like these foods and I if I don’t want to eat it, I won’t. He does like them and that’s fine. I don’t tell him that he can’t eat them, cook them or feed them to the kids. 

Tomorrow our children are having their tonsils removed. Because they will be stuck on a soft diet for few days my husband decided to cook a special meal tonight. He grilled steaks, corn on the cob, mac and cheese and some deer sausage he recently received as a gift. 

As we were fixing plates for ourselves and the kids I said that I didn’t want any sausage. He told me I should taste it- again I said didn’t want it. I find deer meat gamey, dry and stringy. I don’t care how it’s prepared, I don’t want it. But he just kept on, “just try a little” , “have you ever tasted it” , “when did you try it, not since we’ve been together”. The more he pushed, the more resolved I became about not eating it. I’m 40 freaking years old- if I don’t want to eat something , I damn well don’t have to. 

It wasn’t even so much about the sausage anymore. I just wanted him to hear what I was saying and respect me enough to make my damn food choices. 

It ended with him saying “You’re the reason our kids have such a narrow pallet.” I took it as a low blow. He does a lot of cooking in our house but I do a lot of the shopping. I don’t talk about my dislike of certain foods in front of the kids because I don’t want to discourage them from trying new things, I don’t prevent him from cooking the food he likes and I don’t demand that he cook separate meals for me. 

I left the room to cool off, then didn’t eat with the rest of the family because I didn’t feel like eating anymore. But maybe I should have just tried the damn deer to avoid an argument the night before kid’s surgery.

I enjoy drawing so I was supposed to do the drawings. I thought the rest are gonna paint,do the dialogues and give criticism. Nope! We had 4 classes for this and at the end of the 4th WE HAD ONLY HALF DONE. bc I had went to the enfermary bc I felt sick.

Mind you the others did nothing through the whole project. I had to do everything by myself. So I took it home with me beacause I don't want a bad grade. I stayed up late doing the comic bc I underestimated how little we had. My mom commented that they shouldn't have left me with all the work. So now I'm thinking would I be the asshole for getting mad at them beacause they didn't do any of the work?

134,1cmv1eo,AITA for not getting my grandparents free food?,"So I live at my grandparents house on days when im working because it's closer to my job. I stopped by Popeyes after work today and ordered blackened chicken and mac and cheese. It took like 20 mins before an employee finally told me I could add something from the menu onto that for free. I wanted some fries. So I got fries. Another 

10 more minutes pass and they finally bring out the food. They gave me 3 mac and cheeses, the fries, the chicken, and two desserts. I ate one mac and cheese, my chicken, and one dessert. I decided to save the rest for later in the fridge at my grandparents house. 

I explained the situation to them and they're pissed at me for not taking advantage of the situation and getting them any food. I thought they were joking but they were serious. They have been super pissed at me and called me selfish for not giving them some of my food the second I got there so I offered it to them and they declined it.

Context; my grandpa is like Gordon Ramsay. When we bring him to a resturant he never has anything nice to say. He always bags on shit. I told him he wouldn't even like the food anyway and he was trying to argue that he would.

(EDIT): My grandparents also eat at 5PM. It was almost 8PM by that time. I have barely been eating at all anyway so this would be good for me.

135,1cmv12m,WIBTA if I destroy my flatmates life by revealing his lies?,"In 2022, I moved to Canada, and made a friend. This new friend seemed to be a nice person. He was fun to be around and made a genuine effort to hangout with me. He was also new in town, having recently moved to the same city as me. Eventually, we moved into a shared apartment.

Over this time, I have realized that he sucks. For example, he wastes money all the time, but hates the fact that you have to tip restaurant staff. He is frequently rude to baristas, sales associates in stores, waiters, etc. Like if the waiter in the restaurant takes 5 minutes extra to bring a menu, he gets pissed off, and then he doesn’t tip them.

I could overlook all of the above. It’s his life. I’m not his parent. I just decided to keep my distance.

However, he is currently in a serious long distance relationship with a girl. Yet, he is cheating ALL THE TIME. I have explained to him how this is a terrible thing to do, and that one should never do this to someone that they love (he claims that she is the most important thing in his life). In the past year, he has told me multiple stories of hooking with girls, and everytime, 10 minutes later, he is talking to his girlfriend, with no guilt, or regret. 

Recently, he revealed to me that he has to leave Canada as his work permit is expiring, and he needs to do a masters degree to be eligible for residency in Canada in the future. During his search for a degree course, he told me that his bachelor’s degree is fake. He never gave the exams, he never went to that university, he never attended a single lecture. He just paid them money and got the degree. Despite of this, he applied to one of the top universities in UK, and got accepted, and they never bothered to verify details of his fake degree.

He also once admitted to me that he was involved in a hit and run case back home, while drinking and driving. He got away with it through his father’s connections. He doesn’t even know if the guy he hit survived or not.

He will be moving to UK soon. After that, I do not ever want to remain in touch with him. I have no proof for any of the above. However, I can easily gather the evidence by striking a conversation about these topics and record the information.

I know that he has a lot of unresolved trauma due to the way his parents treated him, so I get why he’s like this, but I feel like justice needs to be done. On the other hand, I feel like this is none of my business, and it’s not my place to do anything.

136,1cmv0xz,AITA for making fun of my friends divorce? ,"I (38/F) was bored during COVID quarantine of 2020 and started to play DND. During this, I connected with a DM let's call him Dee (50+/M) who throughout COVID we became friends while he DM a weekly campaign for me and my husband. Over the course of COVID, our campaign ended, and he continued to DM others which my husband joined. I am a part of their discord server, but only in chat/voice and maybe a one-off NPC if time allowed. Also, we chatted on Discord, Facebook and text.

Throughout the campaigns the group became closer, and one day he opened to us about how he was separating from his wife. We all showed sympathy and shared our own heartbreak stories and connected on that level. We spent many sessions just talking and trying to keep his mind off things rather than playing the game.

Fast forward, 7 months their divorce was finalized in March, (it is now May) and we are still playing the campaign. One night Dee said that he was running late due to a “dinner thing”. I was a little high, and my mind started to race with oh it’s a date! I hopped in the chat and said “OOOOO! A date?” Everyone in the chat was making comments going along with the joke. Saying such, she better be pretty, into DND, we want details, and stuff like that. You know normal banter amongst friends.

Dee hopped in the chat and said, “We all needed help”, and they jumped into the game like nothing happened.

I did press the joke longer the next day, more than anyone else asking about what they ate (ramen and rice bowls) and how it went but Dee clarified it was just a work friend meet up and nothing romantic. We ended it there.

2 sessions later, another person on the server said they were running late, and I was tagged by 3rd person asking for my input and I of course razzed them as well. I included Dee in the chat and said that he would make an excellent wingman. I also made a joke about how he would probably be too busy with his girlfriend.

This man had the audacity to DM me to call me a C\*\*T and how dare I allude to the fact that no one would love him ever again. Dee quickly deleted the message and retracted what was said and apologized for his language. My response to him was dismissive and said that he needed to seek help for his anger issues.

Later that night, the DND session was scheduled to go on. Prior to starting, Dee sent me and my husband a DM, explaining why he was upset, and again apologized. I also apologized, and asked in the future if I said anything that does upset him to let me know and that I would stop immediately. I also again said that he needs to seek help with his anger.

Tonight he cancelled DND and then kicked me out of the server, said that he needs some space (I guess from me?).
