0,1cmukce,AITA for yelling at my dad over bread?,"So I (19m) got in a fight with my Dad (65m) over bread. A month ago i was at Trader Joes, I was looking around and found this sun dried tomato parmesan bread, so i bought some. Flash forward a couple days and i had eaten about half of it and it was just sitting in the pantry a couple days so my dad tried it and liked it, i hadn’t touched it in a couple days so he ate some and wrapped it up and put it back in the pantry. 

Most of what i had left was gone so i questioned him about it and he mentioned that it was going to start molding soon so he ate some. I understood and i didn’t care because i hadn’t touched it. My mom was going to Trader Joes soon and i asked her to get two so we could have our own. 

When we got the bread I noticed there were optional oven instructions on the back so i decided to save it until i could cook it in the oven, yet my dad immediately ripped into his and started eating on it then he put it in a ziplock baggie in the fridge. To avoid confusion i grabbed a sharpie and wrote “ZACHS ONLY DO NOT TOUCH PLEASE” over the entire front of the package. 

So a week went by and i asked my mom if she minded cooking it to which she agreed. (The only reason i don’t to it myself is because I’m inexperienced and knew id probably end up forgetting it in there and burning it. My mom would do a better job anyways and also my dad does not let me touch the oven) I went to get the bread but to my surprise it was in a big ziplock baggie. And it was right next to his which was half eaten in a different ziplock baggie. I pulled it out and it had a big chunk out of the top and i was upset because my dad eats with his fingers and licks them. 

Im a germaphobe, so i dont eat or drink after people. My dad came in the room and i was visibly upset. I questioned why he ate it, he said he didnt notice it was mine. I cut him off asking how he didnt since mine was marked, whole, and in a sealed package. I came off aggressive was not yelling, to which he responded by yelling that i could have some of his it wasnt a big deal. I frustratedly started yelling back and I said i was saving it and couldnt understand how he didnt notice that it was mine. I decided to walk away when he said “whats your problem are you on drugs again!?”

About two months ago i was arrested for having weed in my car and spent the night in jail which was the most traumatizing experience ive been through. Ive been clean since but was still really sore about it and he knows cause ive been upset with jokes hes made about it. The Police department is trying to seize my car since is paid off and they can get free money so he has been driving me most places.

I shut myself in my room and cried and he came to my door and yelled “good luck getting to school tomorrow (i have a big exam tomorrow) and to work next week” (im starting a second job cause i have so many fees from the arrest) needless to say im upset but conflicted since i did act out.

1,1cmu1hf,AITA for returning my father's gift because I felt it was much more important to him than it would be for me?,"So my father (54M) wanted to gift me (18M) a special watch of his as a birthday present. He told me that the watch is very, very important to him, as it was the first thing he had ever saved up and bought with his own money. He wanted to give me this watch, but he also told me that he only wanted to give it to someone that would actually wear it and can understand the importance of the watch.

The problem is that, while I understand that the watch is incredible important to him and that he really wanted to give it to me...I simply don't have that same kind of connection to the watch, and I don't think that I would actually wear it if he gave it to me. I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings, but I also didn't want to take something from him that obviously meant a lot to him if I knew deep down that it wouldn't be nearly as important to me. And I dom't really wear watches in the first place so...

When he did give it to me, it ended up just sitting on a countertop for days. He eventually took it back and later called me telling me that if I wouldn't wear it, then he wanted it back. At first, I told him that I would go ahead and start wearing it, then hung up. But as I thought about it, I decided the best thing I could do would be to be honest with him and tell him what I explained in the previous paragraph of this post, and ask him to keep it. He accepted, but it was clear to me that he didn't take it well and was quite irritated and hurt by me asking him to keep it.

Now I don't know if I did the right thing or not. I could've just kept it to save him from being hurt, but it just doesn't feel right telling him that i'm gonna wear it when I know i'm not and that in reality, it would probably just collect dust in a drawer. I don't wanna lie to him, but I also didn't want to hurt his feelings. AITA for making the choice I did?

EDIT: Me and my dad have come to an compromise. I'll wear the watch only on special occations, and then when I'm not wearing it i'll have it in a display case so it doesn't get damaged or collect dust. I still want something to remember my dad by regardless of whether i'll wear the watch often or not, so I feel like this is a fair compromise.

2,1cmtzxu,AITA for telling my roommate he can't have three people over?,"Okay, so I had spent the weekend taking care of a family member with cancer, and when I came back home to my apartment, I walked into three full grown people sleeping on the floor of my living room. We live in a small 800 sq ft apartment, and there are two bedrooms. One is mine, the other is my roommate's.  
  
Now, my roommate cannot afford to pay his half of the rent or utilities. Last month, his girlfriend paid his half of the rent for him. (He still hasn't paid her back). The reason he can't afford to pay rent or utilities is because he lost his job last month because he decided to sleep in and have a threesome with two girls instead of go to work. I was there when I heard him get the call from his boss to let him know he was fired.

Anyway, I covered his half of the utilities, which he still hasn't paid me back. And he can't afford rent or utilities for this month either. 

Now, my roommate is friends with only one of these three people I found sleeping in my living room. One is my roommate's friend's girlfriend, and then the third guy, neither of us know. They told me told that my roommate said that they could crash there. 

Now, I know that these three people do crack, and that they are homeless. My roommate didn't tell me he was inviting anyone or anything. ALSO, they left a huge mess in the kitchen and the bathroom. Dishes everywhere, mudprints all over the floor. Am I the asshole for telling my roommate that this wasn't cool?

3,1cmtu63,AITA for wanting to move in with my SO on the weekend her sister is visiting?,"My gf(26) and I (m26) have been together for 10 years. She recently moved from Texas to Washington state for a new job in February. I have been planning to join her, but had to wait for a bunch of paperwork approval in order to transition to full time remote work.

 After weeks of waiting in the dark, my approval finally came in so I began making plans of when I would drive up there. With it being so sudden, I was planning to try for next weekend (17-19) but was met with disappointment as my gf’s sister, who also lives in Texas, was coming to visit from 16-20. She says she wanted to spend that weekend alone with her sister and would prefer I move up memorial weekend a week later. I have been living at home with my parents making an hour commute to and from work. My plan of driving the 33 hours would have me arriving, ideally, Saturday night if I left Thursday evening. I insisted that I could stay with a mutual friend Saturday night to give them their time and would be fine setting up my work from home area in the other room Sunday. She still would prefer I wait another week in order to not affect her plans.

 I am upset because I was under the impression she could not wait for me to get there and I am dying to move back in with her as well as get out of my parents place as I have been living out of one suitcase while leaving everything else packed in the mean time. Am I being impatient? Should I honor her plans and wait the extra week? 

Edit: I have been stuck awaiting approval since the first week of March. I have been contributing to rent since she moved in, in March. My work does not honor the work from home until I move.

4,1cmtmlh,AITAH for arguing with my track coach about events?,"So for context, I, 18F do shotput and discus in track. I put a lot of effort and time into what I do and I'm pretty average, (30 ft shotput, 65ft discus) and there are these two other girls on my team, let's call them Annie and Frannie, Annie, is a pretty good thrower and she throws further than me, Frannie isn't the best thrower and she throws barely 21 ft in shot and 55 ft in discus, in our division they only take the top 2 throwers in each meet from each team to invitationals, I am the 2nd best thrower, however, every time we don't have to measure the throwing, frannie always gets put in discus before me. At this dual Meet (meet between 2 teams) she threw 55ft and I threw 60 ft (I was on a bad day) so that should mean I go to invitationals for discus since I threw further than her. (Annie is the best thrower on the team so she's not really a part of the story) I also threw shotput further than frannie. So i go to confirm with My coach, let's call him coach G, that I'm going to invites for both shot an discus since I threw further than Frannie. He says ""no, you're in shot and frannies in disc"" which is crazy because I throw more than her. So obviously, I tell him that, and he's like ""you only threw 5 feet more than her, give her a break,"" keep in mind, I train hours, I work hard to get where I'm at and frannie just kind of stands there and complains. So I argue and started saying that exactly, coach G calls me a Brat for sticking up for myself?? My friends said I should just let it go, but last year this girl threw a few inches more than me and coach G said ""well she threw further"" even though I'm more consistent. So this feels unfair.

I have severe ADHD and have been struggling to keep it under control with the stress of university, and this can really affect social situations. Around 2 months ago I was added into a groupchat for the people in my class, its a relatively small class at around 20 people and I had been aquainted wth everyone for a while at this point. At the time, I had no idea this was a work only gc and was never made aware of this, I was under the impression that it was more so we could plan social events which there had been talk of. Occasionally (maybe like once every 2/3 days), I would send snaps that are offtopic to work, often making jokes, which would mostly still be on topic to the university (about lecturers etc). My memory is awful so I could be forgetting details here but I'm like 80% sure that was it. Maybe like half the time I'd get a reply (again terrible memory) but generally speaking I wasn't picking up on any objections to this. Looking back though, other people were only doing this if I started it which is something I should have picked up on but I didn't. Around a month after being added, I was removed by the course rep. She told me a few people found my messages distracting, and I was messaging the chat too late (which I was, my sleep schedule is abysmal and sometimes I forget, totally my fault). I immediately apologised and took responsibility. I also told them that I was never warned and made them aware of my ADHD, to serve as an explanation of the behaviour, not an excuse. I was then added back and apologised there, took responsibility and didn't give any explanations. Most of my friends who were in that gc were confused why I got removed but didn't see it as a big enough deal to give it further thought, which fair enough. One of my friends who happened to also have ADHD empathised and told me that i didn't need to apologise and that they were in the wrong for removing me. My GF also didn't think I did anything wrong, but then again she has dealt with my sometimes inappropriate hyperactiveness for 2 years now.

12,1cmsrxh,AITA for refusing to go out and drink with my old friends?,"To preface: I’m probably gonna write a lot, TL;DR will be at the bottom

Yeah so as the title says I(21F) refused to go out drinking with my old friends(20-22M/F)

It’s not just once I’ve refused to go out with them, around 3 months ago that friend group said they wanted to reconnect, we just grew apart, I said “yeah, let’s grab coffee!” But they just wanted to drink.

And it’s not like drinking in a bar, no no no, they still act like teenagers and drink in a forest or a field.

So when they asked this time I refused outright and said “we are at different stages in life” and now they’re making me out to be the bad guy, maybe I am, but that’s up to you to decide.

A year and a half ago I met my fiancé(24M) it was like that whole love at first sight thing, we were dating pretty soon after meeting each other, we shared so many commonalities, we both come from the poverty line, and have experienced a lot together.

11 months ago he started his first job he was proud of, before that it was working in kitchens, supermarkets, fast food places, stuff he hated. 2 months later I took his lead and got a job I was proud of, 3 months later he proposed and we moved in together.

Since then we’ve been growing together, working on things together, building a life together, hell we plan on moving to the US(we’re from Northern Ireland)

You’re probably wondering how this in any way relates to what I’m saying, I don’t really like drinking anymore, neither does he, we’ll share a glass of wine together, or with our close friends and family but it’s never anything huge, it’s just not my lifestyle anymore.

So back to it, I say “we’re at different stages in life” which I acknowledge might seem rude on the surface, but I don’t think it’s entirely untrue, I’m too old to go binge drink, never mind binge drink in a field.

Since me saying that, a lot of my old friends have come out and said I should just do it for old times sake and to stop being a dick about it.

But they’ve come after my fiancé, which I’m not happy about, they’re saying he’s changed me, how I was a completely different person before him and I can tell it’s weighing on him and that hurts to see, that man has helped me become a better person, and pulled me out of a dark dark place, maybe I should have worded myself differently.

So AITA?

(Also I’m posting this before I go to sleep, if I reply, it’ll be in the morning, goodnight)

TL;DR: Old friends want me to go binge drink in a field, I feel I’m too old for that and at a “different stage in life”, they’ve since starting attacking my fiancé, it’s weighing on him, and it’s making me rethink my actions.

14,1cmsizu,AITA for drama at my school?,"post

I’m going to begin this post with a disclaimer:
I’m in high school, it’s really stupid, and it’s very immature.

I’ll start October. There was a guy (17M) that I (17F) liked a LOT (he’s a really manipulative guy). I’ll call him Liam. He was a lot more mature than any of the other people I knew, and I felt like I could talk to him about my life and faith. But he was also the hyper-religious type. This was peak my obsession with making him see me as a person, just begging for him to stop treating me like a little kid.
In October, I had some drama that resulted in me losing a friend. I’ll call him Phillip. Phillip called me crazy when I tried to fix the situation. I apologized for my actions, none of which were harmful to him in any way. So he and I stopped being friends.
Later, I and my friend (17M, Arnold) were wanting to make some music. We were waiting until our other friend could get an instrument, and I began writing.
Well, fast forward to February. There was a girl (17F) who Arnold liked who was friends with me and Phillip (this is important). I’m calling her Penelope. I had known her for a year. She is very insecure. She made it a point to compare us, tell me that guys liked her more, that I’m weird and my style sucks, and always call herself hot (she really isn’t). I never said anything. She always sang, too. Now, I never thought she could sing that well. I’ve never liked her voice, but again, I didn’t say anything. She was also very flaky. She would say she was going to do something, and then “forget” when she was supposed to do it.
In February, I started talking to a guy (18M) who had a “Liam” of his own. She (17F) used to be my friend as well. I’ll call her Lily. That was until I realized she was just as manipulative. She would tell people things that I told her to keep secret, and she would talk behind everyone’s back. She always called this boy, I’ll call him Dean, “hers.” She has friend-zoned him 5 times.
One night, I was on the phone with Arnold and another boy (17M) who Penelope liked. He had a girlfriend. I’ll call him Caden. Penelope was “starting a band” with them, and I got mad because I had written lyrics to a guitar piece that Arnold wrote. So I said two things: that I didn’t think Penelope would go through with it because she already flaked on him once, and that I don’t like Penelope’s voice. I realize it wasn’t fair of me to talk like that, but she has done that to me.
Arnold told Penelope, who then told me that she needed a break from being friends. I thought it would be good for us. Well, she went to talk to Phillip and caused a lot more drama that I don’t have enough characters to tell.
Penelope went out with Lily and told her everything about me and Dean. Lily eventually ended up getting Dean to block me, and it resulted in me losing friends. I also found out Penelope has been lying about me, too.

16,1cms30s,AITA for talking shit about my close friend,"so for background info i am a girl and i have a class friendgroup with about 6 of us. my friend (who we will call C) is probably the most popular girl in our group and she always brings her friends to our class (who im 99.9999% sure dont fuck with me either).

so me and my other friend in our group (who we will call Z) are always being left out. out of plans, out of talks, everything. i'm always alone in the class and no one makes an effort to be around me. they'll all walk afterschool without me, if i walk with them they'll make me walk in the back. if there's gossip they won't tell me. and i'm pretty sure there's a groupchat without me too. they find no problem with this. 

C just recently got a bf (so happy for her) but all she does is talk abt him and its so annoying. she sits w him everyday and doesnt wanna socialize w her friends anymore, she abandons us for her CREEPY, cheating, victimizing son of a bitch bf. 

i remember we had a summative assignment due that day (our class is the last one of the day) and C asked me to go to our school library with MY id to print it. it costs a lot of money to print, and with both of our articles it would be \~50$. naturally i just tell her to go herself and print it herself but she says ""i'll be with my bf and he doesn't let me do anything"". girl this assignment is worth ur grade and ur future, if u fail u won't even pass, but ur SO in love with this ugly boy you abandon your studies? 

my last straw was last friday when we hung out. my mom drove us to a shopping center and i spent a good 60$ on her. this is after i spent 200$ on her alr. when i ask her to pay me back she always has the same excuse (i have no money). and i just then realized that my moms and i's mutual hatred against her was stronger than fucking everrrrr.

today i called my friend from our trio and told her the whole situation (but called her a few cuss words) and she seems really mad that i even mentioned anything. she said she was uncomfortable and didnt think she was the appropriate person. throughout the call she was rly dry nd angry so ofc i was like whatever, then hung up. 

honestly C is just such a horrible friend, she uses me for money and then doesnt let me eat/drink/use any of her stuff. all she talks to me abt is her bf and i just want to tell her i dont care. she uses me for answers, leaves me out of all the plans and is just so rude for no reason. i want to be mature abt this but its so fucking difficult bc ik now we arent meant to be friends anymore. pls tell me if i'm not being rude enough but that BITCHY whore needs to fuck off from my life and she needs to STOP causing messes w me. literally so fucking tired of her bullshit and i wanna drop her but i dont wanna cause more problems in my friendgroup alr after sm drama. 

",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-08,"AITA for talking shit about my close friend so for background info i am a girl and i have a class friendgroup with about 6 of us. my friend (who we will call C) is probably the most popular girl in our group and she always brings her friends to our class (who im 99.9999% sure dont fuck with me either).

so me and my other friend in our group (who we will call Z) are always being left out. out of plans, out of talks, everything. i'm always alone in the class and no one makes an effort to be around me. they'll all walk afterschool without me, if i walk with them they'll make me walk in the back. if there's gossip they won't tell me. and i'm pretty sure there's a groupchat without me too. they find no problem with this. 

C just recently got a bf (so happy for her) but all she does is talk abt him and its so annoying. she sits w him everyday and doesnt wanna socialize w her friends anymore, she abandons us for her CREEPY, cheating, victimizing son of a bitch bf. 

i remember we had a summative assignment due that day (our class is the last one of the day) and C asked me to go to our school library with MY id to print it. it costs a lot of money to print, and with both of our articles it would be \~50$. naturally i just tell her to go herself and print it herself but she says ""i'll be with my bf and he doesn't let me do anything"". girl this assignment is worth ur grade and ur future, if u fail u won't even pass, but ur SO in love with this ugly boy you abandon your studies? 

my last straw was last friday when we hung out. my mom drove us to a shopping center and i spent a good 60$ on her. this is after i spent 200$ on her alr. when i ask her to pay me back she always has the same excuse (i have no money). and i just then realized that my moms and i's mutual hatred against her was stronger than fucking everrrrr.

He constantly insinuates fights with people, including me, even when they aren’t an issue. A few weeks ago, he ranted about his SO in the general of a discord server but he worded it in such a way that it sounded like a joke. I responded with a joke and the next morning he had responded w/ “no one likes you so shut up” and i found this odd but i didn’t say anything. Someone else in the server had responded to him however saying that i was just joking. He responded back saying that he was joking as well. By this point, i stepped in and told him that the way he worded his first message made me think it was a joke and he proceeded to scold me on how he was mad about it since he had been crying all night about his SO (he didn’t ever specify that he was crying.) I never wanted a fight but he kicked someone out of the server because they were trying to reason w/ him and he was acting weird. His SO eventually got on to basically dismiss anything about the situation at all. K refused to apologize, even after i did, saying that he wasn’t gonna apologize for his feelings and saying “i’ve had a rough couple of weeks” as an excuse for his actions. The other day, K got mad at me for trying to calm down a situation that i didn’t want escalating. Someone (obviously K) vented through an anonymous messaging bot and someone else responded to K, who got mad and immediately threatened to ban. I intervened and said to calm down, to which K responded rather rudely, i tried to explain that maybe they could give a lighter warning before immediately going for a ban as the person had only done it once, and K later scolded me for trying to “override his authority.” I only said anything in the first place because one of the members, who is rather sensitive to things such as fights, we’ll call them O, was returning from a break for a while and i just wanted to stop the situation before the other person had time to respond. O thankfully didn’t witness literal hell about to break loose, but i explained it to him anyways and warned that K was rather..uptight about others opinions that don’t align perfectly with his and will sometimes call others name when they try to reason w/ him. I’m genuinely starting to hate how K acts, and w/ his SO constantly on his side there’s no point in trying to argue with him anymore on the fact that how he acts it unreasonable and negatively affected others.

18,1cmrvlv,AITA for telling my roommate to stop yelling at her cat?,"I (19m) have a roommate (20f) that lives with me and my fiancé. Some context: We both have cats. My fiancé and I handle the treatment of our cat VERY differently than our roommate handles hers. My cat, let’s call her, Bella, is a tabby mix and very loving. We are very careful to not overwhelm her and shower her with lots of affection and playtime. My roommates cat, Mary, gets probably the exact opposite from our roommate. I still try to treat Mary the same way I do Bella, but Mary isn’t very responsive to it. 

When Bella gets into things or acts up, I just take her out of the situation. Like recently, she was playing with a charger, so I just took away the charger and put it out of reach. However, if Mary were to do that, my roommate yells at her and claps loudly or rushes over to the cat, causing her to run away. Mary is very skittish due to my roommate’s behaviour. 

I have tried to kindly approach the subject and originally just decided, we just do things differently. Recently however the yelling has escalated to everytime Mary does something my roommate doesn’t like. The biggest one is when the cat grooms herself. As long as it’s her paws or back it’s fine. But the minute Mary begins to groom her hind legs or genitals, my roommate yells at her, saying for her to stop licking her p*ssy. I don’t understand why! I have repeatedly educated my roommate that she isn’t doing something inappropriate or sexual, which is how my roommate responds to the situation. 

A week ago, after Mary was yelled at for grooming her genitals when a friend was over, I lost it. I asked my roommate to privately speak with me after the friend left. I told her that I thought her treatment of her cat was cruel and unnecessary. She got very mad and said that it’s her cat, not mine, and she can discipline her however my roommate wants. I told her that her “discipline” won’t teach her cat anything and causes Mary way too much stress and anxiety. 

Since then, my roommate has been complaining about me to my fiancé accusing me of being a bad friend that doesn’t respect her. She is refusing to speak to me, and her behaviour towards her cat is getting worse. This has been very upsetting because my roommate has been a very close friend of me and my fiancé (which is why we signed a lease with her in the first place).

I 43f have a daughter Kendra (fake name) who’s 15. My daughter for the last year ish has been hugely obsessed with celebrities like Taylor Swift. It’s become a vocal point in her life to talk about TS’s music or Easter eggs (I think that’s correct).  Honestly I don’t see anything wrong with this,maybe a little concern over how much she knows, but nothing that raises red flags. I’m happy knowing that this is what occupies her time instead of something truly worrying. I’m heavily emphasizing this because a year ago my baby girl was so depressed she couldn’t get out of bed. 

Now the issue at hand is when I was growing up my mother would never allow us to over obsess anything. It’s hard to describe but most of my childhood rules were sit, be quiet, and obey. I’ve limited my contact with my mom due to this stifling but I’ve let her back in. This past weekend my family (including my mom) were sitting and watching TV. Taylor S briefly popped up on the screen and Kendra began talking to her brother about it (also a casual fan). No one was paying attention until my
Mom asked Kendra “When are you gonna grow up?” I snapped at her to leave it but she kept telling Kendra that she was sick and tired of hearing about Taylor. I got defensive saying Kendra hadn’t brought her up this entire time nor had she the last few visits. We kept going back and forth and I asked my kids to leave the room.

My mom brought up the fact that Kendra posts frequently about TS on her insta and I finally snapped saying I don’t mind because at least she feels like she can without judgement. I kept yelling about the fact that I was never able to talk about my interest or hobbies growing up ,so I don’t care if she Kendra gets TS on her forehead if it makes her happy.

23,1cmr7yv,AITA for not giving my daughters ss number to her grandparents,"Aita for not giving my daughters social to her grandparents?? So alittle back story my husband(26) and I(f25) have certain rules when it comes to our daughter. Like people have to respect both parents to see our child or people have to attempt to be involved. I had my daughter in September 2023. Ever sense her “grandparents” from my husbands side has been MIA. We live 15 min from them lol. My baby had severe colic and stomach issues and they had an excuse everytime I asked for help or asked if they could come over so I could shower to watch her. I begged and begged. I also asked to come over to their house so they could see their grand baby and it was a no, and i also volunteered to meet them at a restaurant and pay for my own if they could see their grandkid and it was a no. So as of January 12th 2024 I made a rule where I’m not gonna beg people to see my child so they haven’t seen my child at all.  They are lousy. 

Anyway, yesterday my husband received a text from his mom asking for my daughter’s social security number because they wanna open a college savings for her. But my husband and I don’t feel comfortable giving that information out, mostly my husbands step dad who has no job and gambling problem. The first thing that went through my mind was “he’s gonna get a credit in her name”. Anyway so we told them sorry no. And that made them angry and now one of the grandparents aka my husbands step dad. Blocked us on Facebook and blocked my mom on Facebook. So aita for saying no? Or should I have let them. 

Edit: sense people are getting confused. No I don’t ask them to baby sit I don’t let anyone babysit my kid. Also I don’t have family in this state so I wanted them to have a relationship with my child so she has family that live close but I should have known if the mother wasn’t there for her own kids and left them to fend for themselves then she ain’t gonna be a grandparent. 
Also we have a college fund for our baby already going they could easily contribute but with the step dads (grandparent) background I don’t trust them to have her social. 
If y’all met these people you would understand but you can only go off what I say. Also my husband has tried to take her over to see them and it’s an excuse everytime. They do the same to their other grandchild that my husband sister has. So they hate both kids and grandkids equally I guess.
Also with the stepdad (grandparent) back ground, I don’t trust my daughters social to be in some random hands. And the step dad and the mom has only been together for 7 years. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-08,"AITA for not giving my daughters ss number to her grandparents Aita for not giving my daughters social to her grandparents?? So alittle back story my husband(26) and I(f25) have certain rules when it comes to our daughter. Like people have to respect both parents to see our child or people have to attempt to be involved. I had my daughter in September 2023. Ever sense her “grandparents” from my husbands side has been MIA. We live 15 min from them lol. My baby had severe colic and stomach issues and they had an excuse everytime I asked for help or asked if they could come over so I could shower to watch her. I begged and begged. I also asked to come over to their house so they could see their grand baby and it was a no, and i also volunteered to meet them at a restaurant and pay for my own if they could see their grandkid and it was a no. So as of January 12th 2024 I made a rule where I’m not gonna beg people to see my child so they haven’t seen my child at all.  They are lousy. 

Anyway, yesterday my husband received a text from his mom asking for my daughter’s social security number because they wanna open a college savings for her. But my husband and I don’t feel comfortable giving that information out, mostly my husbands step dad who has no job and gambling problem. The first thing that went through my mind was “he’s gonna get a credit in her name”. Anyway so we told them sorry no. And that made them angry and now one of the grandparents aka my husbands step dad. Blocked us on Facebook and blocked my mom on Facebook. So aita for saying no? Or should I have let them.

24,1cmqwl8,AITA for not allowing kids 4-8 watch nightmare on elm street.,"Again blended family. We invite my friend over who has 3 boys under 5. The kids in my house are ages 14-8. That night of our little visit, after grilling, everyone wanted to watch a movie.

The older 14 year olds want to watch nightmare on elm street, in fact, they insist. Loudly. The other kids are clueless. My husband, the big kid, says the movie is fine for all the kids. 

I do not agree, I state this loudly. My friend is neutral. Doesn’t seem to care. The youngest in the house is 4. 

I object again snd say we can put a Disney movie on in my room, it has a big soft bed and a TV. They can watch a tame movie while the big kids go in the finished basement and watch whatever. 

This is vetoed. I put my foot down. 

The kids under 8 go upstairs. The littles go up. I get the silent treatment. 

My husband says nothing in support of me. Nor does my friend. I explain I don’t feel heard and kid I’m the bad guy. Again people ignore it. Kids run off to watch the movies. 

Am I the asshole for setting limits on horror movies? A 4, 5, 6 and 7 year old shouldn’t watch Freddy Kruger. Why is this bad?
