0,1cnqe5u,AITA for talking to a manger about some coworkers?,"I (m19) work in retail at the same business as my father. He is a manager and I‚Äôm a cashier, but we do not work together in the same areas due to company policy, and good boundaries. Recently, a friend of mine was hired to work under him, and my dad made a point to tell me I wasn‚Äôt to discuss any work situations regarding his team members with him at home, especially if I wasn‚Äôt directly involved. This has recently become very complicated. My friend entered the break room to two coworkers talking about them, as well as talking about me. They didn‚Äôt say anything directly disparaging, but they did say something along the lines of ‚Äú[hearing] some things about her*‚Äù, and making some ugly faces. I heard all of this through my friend, who was angry that they had been talking about us. I didn‚Äôt know either of these coworkers, as I rarely left the front of the store or talked to anyone that wasn‚Äôt also a cashier. 

The idea that strangers were talking about me and generally being rude about me to my friends bugged me, so I made the decision to talk to my team leader about the situation. That choice is where I may be the asshole. During this discussion, I found out that the two coworkers worked under my father and that I also work alongside one of their daughters. The leader needed to talk to my friend, as they were the one there for the situation, and they asked me whether I‚Äôd like the situation to go directly to hr or be brought to my father. I wasn‚Äôt going to talk to my father about it, because he told me not to, but I didn‚Äôt want hr involved yet because my father had also said he wants people to talk to him as well instead of only going to hr. I asked the leader to let my father know about the issue.

I don‚Äôt know any current details of where the situation stands because it would mean discussing it with my father outside of work. He has spoken to my mother about the situation though, and she brought it up to me. She believes that the situation wasn‚Äôt one worthy of telling a leader about, because it was going to have to be brought to hr no matter what. She suggested I should‚Äôve tried to speak to the coworkers directly. Her belief is based on the info my father gave on the issue, and I still don‚Äôt know his thoughts. 

There is a possibility that these coworkers weren‚Äôt trying to be rude, and were just joking, because my friend and I both have issues with tone. This would also make me the asshole, for creating a problem from nothing. I don‚Äôt believe this to be the case, as they are complete strangers to me and my friend.

Am I the asshole for talking to my leader about coworkers who were possibly talking bad about me?

*I am an openly trans man, and it is common knowledge in my workplace. I wear my pronouns on my name badge and use a chosen name. None of my close coworkers or leaders/managers have ever purposefully referred to me with she/her pronouns.

This is not the first time. I've been doing my best to support her and we both took a few days off work. 

My sister (F34) is currently pregnant, after many, many years of infertility issues and going through IVF. She is really excited and equally stressed about losing the baby, but I am incredibly happy for her and everything is apparently going really well health wise. 

On Sunday, my sister has her baby shower. My wife does not want to attend, and I completely understand. So does my sister, who we have told. Sister is completely sympathetic and said she doesn't expect me to attend either, but I know she wants me too. 

My wife doesn't want me to, saying she needs my support right now. Everything in the family is all about babies right now and knowing where I am, she feels like its going to put her over the top.

I feel extremely torn. I want to go to my sisters baby shower. It's been a long time coming and I'm really happy for her, and excited for her and to be an uncle.

My peers describe me as a cheerful, upbeat person always trying to make others smile/laugh, which isn‚Äôt always easy. I‚Äôm human too and struggle to keep myself in high spirits. I still try, but sometimes I need to preserve that energy for other things.

The issue: My primary job‚Äôs managers have been‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs saw inept. Case in point:

They‚Äôre hypocritical. Never take accountability for their mistakes and blame us instead. Make passive-aggressive remarks about us openly during meetings. Nitpick the most mundane things. TOO MANY pot-calling-the-kettle-black situations. Consistently prying into people‚Äôs personal matters and probing others for info. Setting unrealistic expectations for when a job should be done (it varies on the job and our physical fatigue). Zero compassion to anyone struggling with something. And these are just the ones I can think of right now.

Just today, someone put in their two-weeks and the head boss passive-aggressively berated them for it.

Now they‚Äôre targeting me for ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that they have not gone after anyone else for. I know this because I‚Äôve asked a few coworkers if any of them were spoken to about similar ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù, and they denied so. Naturally, I feel singled out. They said others claim that I ‚Äútalk too much‚Äù on the job and I ‚Äúgo out of my way‚Äù to talk to my coworker and/or customers. That irked me because I‚Äôm not just standing around jibber-jabbering.

Yes, I sometimes chat WHILE I‚ÄôM WORKING, but who doesn‚Äôt? This isn‚Äôt me bantering like we‚Äôre old friends. I‚Äôm doing my damn job and building a report with the customer, so they feel comfortable around me.

The past few months, the over exertion has caught up to me. My energy has waned, and others have noticed. According to my bosses, my work has become inefficient here and there (I can admit that), I‚Äôm less talkative and cheerful in the morning (I‚Äôm tired and stressed, and NOT a morning person), and I ‚Äúact like I don‚Äôt like my job‚Äù. First they claim I talk too much, then get concerned I don‚Äôt talk anymore. I can‚Äôt win and I refuse to play.

They know of my second job, but they say it doesn‚Äôt excuse my behavior. I told them it doesn‚Äôt, but it DOES explain it. All I can do is try harder in the future. I keep my personal business to myself and that bothers them. GOOD. My life, my decisions.

I enjoy the job. I really do. I love seeing my progress and helping people. It‚Äôs the bureaucratic B.S and discontented treatment I‚Äôm sick of. My coworkers all secretly agree. No job is worth this degradation. I‚Äôm done.

A few months ago, one of Dirk‚Äôs best friends died in a car accident. Dirk played basketball with this boy and I‚Äôd always see him when Dirk had friends over.

Our living room has stuff I and Rufus like, Rufus has some Star Wars and robotics stuff in the living room that can‚Äôt fit in our rooms.

Dirk and our parents were out at some basketball thing for Dirk, they had picked Rufus and he came in the house alone. I told my boyfriend to relax, but once Rufus called Dirk a ‚Äúc\*\*\*k lover‚Äù he got up and started to tell Rufus to shut up. They had a screaming match before Rufus went in his room.  
  
I told him that he knows Rufus says bigoted stuff, like using the n word on his video games. Our parents have tried therapy and inclusivity training and taking his phone but nothing has worked, this has been an issue since he was 8-9. I told him I‚Äôve given up on Rufus but he said I should still try, and he asked how I would feel if someone attacked me for being gay. I told him Rufus has used the f slur before and he asked me why I‚Äôve hidden that from him.   
  
Since then, my boyfriend says he only wants to meet at his house and not my house anymore and he‚Äôs saying I need to ‚Äúgrow a backbone‚Äù.

Dirk and our parents were out at some basketball thing for Dirk, they had picked Rufus and he came in the house alone. I told my boyfriend to relax, but once Rufus called Dirk a ‚Äúc\*\*\*k lover‚Äù he got up and started to tell Rufus to shut up. They had a screaming match before Rufus went in his room.  
  
I told him that he knows Rufus says bigoted stuff, like using the n word on his video games. Our parents have tried therapy and inclusivity training and taking his phone but nothing has worked, this has been an issue since he was 8-9. I told him I‚Äôve given up on Rufus but he said I should still try, and he asked how I would feel if someone attacked me for being gay. I told him Rufus has used the f slur before and he asked me why I‚Äôve hidden that from him.   
  
Since then, my boyfriend says he only wants to meet at his house and not my house anymore and he‚Äôs saying I need to ‚Äúgrow a backbone‚Äù. He said I need to learn to ‚Äústick up for Dirk‚Äù in the future and how Dirk would be a great BIL but Rufus would be a terrible one. I told him it‚Äôs not that simple but he just rolls his eyes at me. AITA?",1.0,0.011595645,0,0

My BF recently is in recovery due to his relapse. During this relapse he hung out with friend A‚Äôs family and stuff was said and done that I‚Äôm not happy with. He knows where he messed up and feels horrible for it. We were separated during this time, but I was worried about him every day. Friend A was the only person who checked in on me during this period.

9,1cnn8bt,AITA for publicly calling out my co-worker for her weird behavior?,"I (22M) have been working at a fairly new restaurant for about 6 months now.  The owners are nice and the staff get a long  well since it is a family owned business and not a part of a corporation.  I work in the kitchen along with a few other guys, let‚Äôs call the guy on fryer Evan (fake name).  Evan was this really kind guy that would go out of his way to help you, just really great guy in general.  He had a heart condition that caused him to have seizures somewhat often among other things.  Last week, Evan unfortunately passed away due to his condition and the staff/owners have been arranging things with Evans family to help him during this hard time.  

Evan had passed a few days before his birthday and one of the servers and Evan had planned to do something together to celebrate it since they‚Äôd both be working on his birthday.  She had made Evan a cake prior to his death, so on his birthday all of the staff and family come to celebrate his birthday and life.  This is where ‚ÄòFiona‚Äô comes in (fake name).  Fiona is a server that has been working with Evan and myself for a few months now. 

At the celebration, Fiona was quite upset (understandably) and was inconsolable for most of the time.  There was a few words said, mainly by the family, some staff and by the restaurant owners but also by Fiona.  Her message started off normal until it turned weird?  She began talking about how her and Evan were work husband and wife and how she will miss seeing him every time they worked together.  The issue was that Evan‚Äôs fianc√©e and Fiona‚Äôs boyfriend were both in attendance.  The fianc√©e obviously was upset from the fact she had lost Evan but now Fiona saying that she was his work wife at his celebration of life.  

All of the staff were in shock at this, Fiona was a few drinks deep and she was a bit of a messy drunk but no one had expected her to say that.  After she said this in front of everybody, another co-worker of ours managed to get the mic out of her hands and to head home.  Nobody had mentioned it for the rest of the night because of just not knowing how to process her sobbing about missing her work husband.  Today though, we had a shift together and we naturally didn‚Äôt talk that much due to working in different areas of the restaurant but she had been acting off and still very sad. I had heard from another server that she was still going on about how hard Evans death has been on here as his work wife and that she should‚Äôve received time 

I‚Äôm not too sure why I took it so personally but I asked her in front of all of the staff that was working (most since it was a busier night) why she was acting like she was his actual wife.  She got upset saying I had no right to talk to her like I did, especially about Evan, and that I was a prick.  We exchanged some words then avoided each other for the rest of our shifts.

Recently, we had been talking, idk how we got on the conversation but he had said something about how sometimes my lack of motivation rubs off on him. 

I wasn't quite sure what he meant so I asked if he could explain further. He gave me the examples that I still live with my parents, I'm not in college, and it seems I have a distinct lack of motivation to follow my art career. He continued to say that he'd probably not talk to me much once he moved since he wanted to be surrounded by more people like him. Fair enough. 

He continued on to say he had talked to his other friends about how he felt with my lack of motivation as well. And that they described my behavior as a 'leech'. It had seriously hurt my feelings and I didn't know what to say, or if I was being stupid not understanding. 

I asked him if he would be comfortable if I brought our short-term mutual friend in to see if he could better explain it to me or understand better. He agreed, and I also asked said friend if he'd be comfortable in conversation. 

He also didn't seem to be understanding, I was still upset, when I get upset I clam up and it's hard for me to speak. I began texting M saying that I felt like leech was a little too much, and hurt my feelings.

16,1cnm536,AITA for telling my friend I don‚Äôt think that she can be a doctor?,"Hi hello, here is my dilemma. 

Recently, my (24F) best friend (24F) and I were speaking about her career ambitions. She has been saying for the past several years that she wants to be a doctor. Her main reasons for wanting such a thing are, in addition to being able to help people, making a lot of money and ‚Äúgetting to be the one in charge.‚Äù Those things are all rather consistent with her personality. She asked me if I thought that she could become a doctor and I definitely hesitated to provide an answer, which put us in a rocky position. 

Originally, she had joined our college as a student in the nursing program, but she failed out about a year ago due to not making passing grades for the program requirements. She was absolutely heartbroken about this and appealed to no avail, and I was supportive of her as much as a friend can be in helping her look at alternative educational pathways. Nevertheless, she doubled down on the fact that she wanted to be a doctor, and decided to pursue a career in the sciences as a stepping stone regardless. The other thing is, she‚Äôs never made that great of grades. She‚Äôs been pretty consistent in a B-C average the entire time we‚Äôve been in school together. 

So, when she asked me, I was honest with her and told her that medical school is a really advanced academic pursuit, and I wasn‚Äôt sure that her grades would allow her to actually take that career path. She was, understandably, offended and commented that me saying that just made her want to do it even more. She definitely seemed hurt. She mentioned thinking that she could get by on the interview portion of applications, so I tried explaining to her that medical schools will more than likely screen out her application based on her GPA.

I think I could be an asshole because I told my best friend that I don‚Äôt think that she can achieve her career pursuits, and that was hurtful towards her. I‚Äôve never struggled in school the way that she has, and have earned academic accolades at a state and national level and am on track to graduate some form of cum laude on the president‚Äôs honor roll. I‚Äôve always had a hunch that she‚Äôs been at least somewhat resentful of how naturally academics have come to me.

19,1cnlxam,AITA for not wanting to get down to the brass tax with my ex about shared car?,"I've gone through a really rough and prolonged breakup with a partner. Before the breakup, we had been living together for years. During that time, I had my own car that I bought under my name. We both have low income, so we worked out a deal where we split the insurance, gas and any repairs we had to do on the car. Going into the agreement, they mentioned that the only kind of repairs they may not want to contribute to are ones that would be major investments that would contribute to the long term value of the car. The plan was never that we would share the car indefinitely, so that seemed like a reasonable boundary to me.

Fast forward to this past year and a half, outside of car stuff, they went through a lot of personal turmoil that was really intense, and our relationship fell apart. After a year of trying to make it work, while they were presenting very difficult behaviour, I finally moved out. Since moving out, we've still been sharing the car. Despite the breakup being heartbreaking, it's still been amicable, and I live nearby so it's been mutually beneficial.

NOW, I have just gotten some big career news, and I need to relocate to another part of town by next month. Given the distance, it doesn't make sense for us to keep sharing this car, so I kindly let them know that I'd need to take the car back as mine. I could tell they were emotional to hear this update, and they blurted out that they wanted to talk about the repair expenses that have gone into the car since we've been sharing it. There have been some bigger expenses, like brake maintenance that's been around $1300 a couple times over the years, and tire replacements, but it's been a year since we got those updates. The only recent maintenance has been repairing an exhaust leak a couple months ago that cost a few hundred bucks.

23,1cnlgj8,AITA for doing the laundry and not following the rules?,"I'm 18F with divorced parents since 15. My dad remarried (less than a year later), and my mom remained single. Even after turning 18 a couple of months ago, I've still been following the court schedule because I don't want to be away from my siblings.

I have a cat at my dad's house, and today she threw up on my bed sheets. I went to go put them in the wash. When I left my room to do so, my dad's wife looked at me and asked, ""Are you washing those right now?"" I said yes, and she replied, ""Okay, go ahead.""

Later, I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer, and that's when my dad's wife asked me, ""Is it your laundry day?"" (she had designated laundry days, I do my laundry on Sunday night before school.) I explained that my cat had thrown up on my sheets, so I needed to wash them since I was going to my mom's later and didn't want my room to smell.

She then started to throw a fit, and I got fed up. I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer and called my dad to ask what the big deal was with her. While passing his wife to go to my room while I was still talking to him, she told me, ""Sit down and talk, don't give me any attitude."" I responded that I was on the phone with my dad, to which she replied, ""Oh, don't worry I'll call him up later as well.""

When I sat in my room to continue talking to him, I told him what had happened. He blew up on me, saying, I'm not the only person in the house with laundry emergencies (even though no one else needed to do laundry at the time), I'm trying to break his marriage apart and have been for years (I never did anything and stay in my room 24/7 at my dads), no one wants me in the house, my therapy sessions are BS as I give everyone else problems (despite my suffering from panic attacks and depression), Why don't you just go live with your mom? I don't know why you're still in my house (even though I'm here for my siblings), and finally, ""Respect my wife and speak to her.""

I'm 18F with divorced parents since 15. My dad remarried (less than a year later), and my mom remained single. Even after turning 18 a couple of months ago, I've still been following the court schedule because I don't want to be away from my siblings.

I have a cat at my dad's house, and today she threw up on my bed sheets. I went to go put them in the wash. When I left my room to do so, my dad's wife looked at me and asked, ""Are you washing those right now?"" I said yes, and she replied, ""Okay, go ahead.""

Later, I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer, and that's when my dad's wife asked me, ""Is it your laundry day?"" (she had designated laundry days, I do my laundry on Sunday night before school.) I explained that my cat had thrown up on my sheets, so I needed to wash them since I was going to my mom's later and didn't want my room to smell.

She then started to throw a fit, and I got fed up. I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer and called my dad to ask what the big deal was with her. While passing his wife to go to my room while I was still talking to him, she told me, ""Sit down and talk, don't give me any attitude."" I responded that I was on the phone with my dad, to which she replied, ""Oh, don't worry I'll call him up later as well.""

When I sat in my room to continue talking to him, I told him what had happened. He blew up on me, saying, I'm not the only person in the house with laundry emergencies (even though no one else needed to do laundry at the time), I'm trying to break his marriage apart and have been for years (I never did anything and stay in my room 24/7 at my dads), no one wants me in the house, my therapy sessions are BS as I give everyone else problems (despite my suffering from panic attacks and depression), Why don't you just go live with your mom? I don't know why you're still in my house (even though I'm here for my siblings), and finally, ""Respect my wife and speak to her.""

As her 40th birthday approached, 40f decided that this was the year to have a ‚Äúgiving back‚Äù party. She said she didn‚Äôt want any presents, but she wanted us to bring items to donate to a local residential facility for women and children.  We were to wrap our donations as if they were birthday presents and the party was timed so that the residents would receive gifts and unwrap them in our presence before we had to leave. She was providing a Happy UnBirthday cake that the residents could enjoy together, and cards and envelopes so the residents could write thank you notes to her.

I felt that the party was kind of performative. I didn‚Äôt critique the party to her or anyone except my husband and children, though.

I was prepared for her being angry, because she always is when I tell her No, but I was not prepared for the rest of the family being upset with me for not warning them I wouldn‚Äôt be attending. She had called everyone bad names because only one local cousin showed up, plus a few of the people she supervises at her work.

We have been together for 2+ years now and I moved in after MIL offered me to around the 6 month mark of me and my partner dating. My home life is messed up, which is why she offered to let me move in (I think anyway, my partner told her about my past and that‚Äôs when she offered so I think that‚Äôs why).

Anyways, a few weeks ago my partner and I had left for a 2-week long camping trip. Prior to leaving I had asked MIL if she could watch my 3 cats, and I told her that if she didn‚Äôt want to I could get my brother to come and care for them. 

She said there was no need for my brother to come and she would care for them. When we got back I went down to the basement to put away our camping stuff and found cat litter EVERYWHERE.

She never cleaned the litter while I was gone! There was cat pee and poop all over the carpet. I went upstairs and asked MIL why she didn‚Äôt clean the cat litter and she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my responsibly.‚Äù - I told her that she said she would watch them and that means she should‚Äôve cleaned the cat litter, and that if she didn‚Äôt want to, she could have told me so I could get my brother to do it.

She got defensive and I just ignored her and tried to clean up the carpet. I even rented a steam cleaner but nothing worked and there is still a smell and some stains.

Yesterday, MIL told me that I have to pay to replace the carpets because the cat pee smell won‚Äôt come out. I told her no because she should have cleaned their litter box after she said she would watch my cats.

My partner and I have been arguing about it since because MIL is complaining to him about me. I have started to look for apartments now.

So, I (M22) am dating my girlfriend of eight months (F21). The problem is the following:

Today, I decided to the movie theater with my siblings as I treat. I've been struggling with university time management and exams lately, so I haven't had the time to relax except for watching shows in the evenings before bed. I always make sure to text my girlfriend throughout the day because we both enjoy it. For the last days, she seemed down and mentioned she felt a bit sad lately. However, and I might be in the wrong here, I didn't ask specifically ask why and instead, told her several times that I was sorry she felt that way and that I wished I could take her sadness away. 

I told her that I'd go to the movie theater to watch a movie. She mentioned she'd missed me and I told her I'd miss her as well. Then, I turned off my phone and enjoyed the film. Three hours later, I texted her that I was now free. Instead of asking me about the movie or how I was as she usually would, she sent a simple text message. I asked her what was wrong and she said she felt on a low mood.

Now, this is where I might be the AH. But I genuinely didn't wanted to let me mood be ruined by this (I finally got to relax after weeks, I didn't wanted to ruin it). So instead, I turned off my phone and talked to my friends that came along about the movie. Then, as I arrived home, I turned on my phone to tell her that I got home. I realized that she wasn't being as enthusiastic as before when telling me about her day and I realized that I hadn't asked her how her day went. When I did, she replied shortly, which isn't normal. So I asked her what was wrong. Then she said that she was sad and wasn't in the mood to talk, which made me upset because I wanted to talk to her before bed (I find it relaxing and sweet). She said she loved me and that she hoped I rested well. And that I could tell her about the movie tomorrow because she felt drained.

I asked her why and she said that she missed me throughout the day and wanted to talk to me but I was busy with lessons (I forgot to because I was focused and stressed). So I asked her why she didn't wanted to now, and she said that she knew I'd doze off and not listen clearly as always. She said that her 'excitement expired' and wanted to talk tomorrow instead. I insisted on solving this before going to bed but she just said goodnight and is now offline. I'm upset at the situation and really don't understand what I did wrong.

32,1cnkdux,"AITA Helped a ""friend"" get an apartment but I'm bailing. ","First real post. 

So I(38m) had a friend(38f) of 5 years that asked me to help them get a place because their credit is garbage and they don't have savings. For context they are in a custody battle for their 2 girls.

I offered to cosign after making sure they could afford the $1,400 2 bedroom. 

I signed and helped them with the deposit. 

Skip to a few weeks ago, I have spent $4,300 helping her with rent. I had an agreement that I'd move in and she'd pay rent... essentially paying me back by having me live rent free. Side note... she agreed but left out the live in boyfriend(37m) who is also broke.

Cut to rent payments missed and her threatening to cut off internet. For context I work remotely. She basically is threatening my good credit and my ability to work if I don't keep covering rent and utilities.

I signed a lease and am moving out tomorrow to a 1 bedroom. I'm willing to let that lease get to the point of eviction because I can't just support these people.

Am I the asshole for moving out and forcing her to pay rent?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"AITA Helped a ""friend"" get an apartment but I'm bailing.  First real post.

33,1cnjzv1,AITA for maybe ruining my brothers friendship with his friend?,"My (17M) brother (18M) graduates May 16th. My 'boyfriend' is his friend. He's not really my boyfriend I'm not sure what we are I'm just calling him that to be simple. 

My 'boyfriend' and I had just stopped talking for a while. About a little over a week ago I sent him a text asking him how he was doing this. I did this because I was bored and I kinda missed him. He texted me back and we just started talking. I was in my 5th block during the time and I heard one of my classmates bringing up graduation. I hadn't seen him in a while and in my thought process I thought this could be used as an opportunity to see him again. I sent him a text asking him if he was coming to my brothers graduation because from my knowledge I thought they were still friends. 

But when I sent that he sent me a text saying ""I wasn't invited üëç""  that caught me off guard and I tried to like back track a little bit but he still wasn't happy. I told him that he didn't need an invitation to come but he just told me that ""I'm not gonna go somewhere when he aint even ask me to come fr"" 

I didn't know what to say after that as he was kinda upset. I tried to talk about it somemore but he just kinda dismissed me and told me that he'll *think* about coming for me but won't guarantee it. 

But after we stopped texting I'm assuming he blocked my brother or sometime after. I'm not sure if it was sometime later or right after but I'm not sure because my brother only noticed yesteday that he was blocked. He was confused on why he couldn't get in touch with him and I tried my best to be honest with him and told him that I mentioned his graduation to my 'boyfriend' and he wasn't happy about not being asked to come to his graduation.

My brother was mad at me and told me that I shouldn't of mentioned anything to him and told me that he didn't know if his friend wanted to come or not because they haven't been talking as frequent any more. 

I apologized to him but he was still mad at me and asked me to talk to my 'boyfriend' to get him unblocked but I had already did that and he told me that he was hurt that he wasn't thought of because he knows  that their other friends were coming and he didn't want to be friends with someone like that.

My brother is mad and I don't know what to do. It wasn't my intention to ruin their friendship and I wouldn't have mentioned it if I would have known. I'm not sure if my 'boyfriend' is planning on unblocking my brother or not as hes not giving me a clear answer. My parents are on ""my side"" because they said I couldn't have known that he wasn't asked to come. But my brother is still mad at me and have barley spoken to me today.

34,1cnjox5,AITA for parking our car in front of our driveway when it blocks our neighbors truck? ,"AITA for parking our car on the street when it blocks our neighbors truck

We have a really good relationship with all our neighbors, which is a priority for our family. The neighors across the street are especially great, and we enjoy chatting with them. I was very touched recently when my dad (who also lived on our street) passed and they attended his service. They cried with my mom, brought soup for her, and are just really great people. All that to say, I really don't want to be an A-hole as I value our relationship. 

For years, they have parked their large delivery trucks in their drive way and sometimes on the street in front of their house - this has never been an issue. However, they recently got a new delivery truck that is much larger than the previous ones - so much so that to get it out of their driveway the turn is so wide the truck comes to our curb and grazes the front of our driveway. 

We recently put up a basketball hoop in our driveway for our 4 young kids, aged 4-9, and when they play during the day, I've been parking our van at the front of our driveway, parallel to the street but blocking our driveway so the basketball doesn't roll into the street when they play (and so our kids don't chase it into the street).

Our neighbor messaged us to let us know that when we park like that, it's almost impossible for them to get the delivery truck in and out of their driveway (our driveway is not facing theirs, but the truck has a really wide turn). As I was watching them pull out this morning, I realized that if we have a car parked on the street really anywhere in front of our house, it will be impossible for them to pull their truck out. 

I don't want to be limited to keeping our van only in our driveway, as I want my kids to be able to play there especially as the weather gets better. We bought this particular house to enable our kids to play outside. I also want my guests to be able to park in front of our house, which will now be an issue. I feel like our neighbors should have considered that they wouldn't be able to get that large truck in and out of their driveway if anyone is parked on the street, and considered that before they got such a large commercial vehicle to park on our residential street. However, I also know that that ship has sailed - they already have the truck, it affects their livlihood, and if we park in front of our house they are basically stuck.  

AITA if we continue to park in front of our house, or let guests park in front of our house, knowing they won't be able to get their truck in and out???",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"AITA for parking our car in front of our driveway when it blocks our neighbors truck?
