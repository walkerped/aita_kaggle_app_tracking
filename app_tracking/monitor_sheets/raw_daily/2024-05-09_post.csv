0,1cnqe5u,AITA for talking to a manger about some coworkers?,"I (m19) work in retail at the same business as my father. He is a manager and I‚Äôm a cashier, but we do not work together in the same areas due to company policy, and good boundaries. Recently, a friend of mine was hired to work under him, and my dad made a point to tell me I wasn‚Äôt to discuss any work situations regarding his team members with him at home, especially if I wasn‚Äôt directly involved. This has recently become very complicated. My friend entered the break room to two coworkers talking about them, as well as talking about me. They didn‚Äôt say anything directly disparaging, but they did say something along the lines of ‚Äú[hearing] some things about her*‚Äù, and making some ugly faces. I heard all of this through my friend, who was angry that they had been talking about us. I didn‚Äôt know either of these coworkers, as I rarely left the front of the store or talked to anyone that wasn‚Äôt also a cashier. 

The idea that strangers were talking about me and generally being rude about me to my friends bugged me, so I made the decision to talk to my team leader about the situation. That choice is where I may be the asshole. During this discussion, I found out that the two coworkers worked under my father and that I also work alongside one of their daughters. The leader needed to talk to my friend, as they were the one there for the situation, and they asked me whether I‚Äôd like the situation to go directly to hr or be brought to my father. I wasn‚Äôt going to talk to my father about it, because he told me not to, but I didn‚Äôt want hr involved yet because my father had also said he wants people to talk to him as well instead of only going to hr. I asked the leader to let my father know about the issue.

I don‚Äôt know any current details of where the situation stands because it would mean discussing it with my father outside of work. He has spoken to my mother about the situation though, and she brought it up to me. She believes that the situation wasn‚Äôt one worthy of telling a leader about, because it was going to have to be brought to hr no matter what. She suggested I should‚Äôve tried to speak to the coworkers directly. Her belief is based on the info my father gave on the issue, and I still don‚Äôt know his thoughts. 

There is a possibility that these coworkers weren‚Äôt trying to be rude, and were just joking, because my friend and I both have issues with tone. This would also make me the asshole, for creating a problem from nothing. I don‚Äôt believe this to be the case, as they are complete strangers to me and my friend.

Am I the asshole for talking to my leader about coworkers who were possibly talking bad about me?

*I am an openly trans man, and it is common knowledge in my workplace. I wear my pronouns on my name badge and use a chosen name. None of my close coworkers or leaders/managers have ever purposefully referred to me with she/her pronouns.

This is not the first time. I've been doing my best to support her and we both took a few days off work. 

My sister (F34) is currently pregnant, after many, many years of infertility issues and going through IVF. She is really excited and equally stressed about losing the baby, but I am incredibly happy for her and everything is apparently going really well health wise. 

On Sunday, my sister has her baby shower. My wife does not want to attend, and I completely understand. So does my sister, who we have told. Sister is completely sympathetic and said she doesn't expect me to attend either, but I know she wants me too. 

My wife doesn't want me to, saying she needs my support right now. Everything in the family is all about babies right now and knowing where I am, she feels like its going to put her over the top.

I feel extremely torn. I want to go to my sisters baby shower. It's been a long time coming and I'm really happy for her, and excited for her and to be an uncle.

My peers describe me as a cheerful, upbeat person always trying to make others smile/laugh, which isn‚Äôt always easy. I‚Äôm human too and struggle to keep myself in high spirits. I still try, but sometimes I need to preserve that energy for other things.

The issue: My primary job‚Äôs managers have been‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs saw inept. Case in point:

They‚Äôre hypocritical. Never take accountability for their mistakes and blame us instead. Make passive-aggressive remarks about us openly during meetings. Nitpick the most mundane things. TOO MANY pot-calling-the-kettle-black situations. Consistently prying into people‚Äôs personal matters and probing others for info. Setting unrealistic expectations for when a job should be done (it varies on the job and our physical fatigue). Zero compassion to anyone struggling with something. And these are just the ones I can think of right now.

Just today, someone put in their two-weeks and the head boss passive-aggressively berated them for it.

Now they‚Äôre targeting me for ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that they have not gone after anyone else for. I know this because I‚Äôve asked a few coworkers if any of them were spoken to about similar ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù, and they denied so. Naturally, I feel singled out. They said others claim that I ‚Äútalk too much‚Äù on the job and I ‚Äúgo out of my way‚Äù to talk to my coworker and/or customers. That irked me because I‚Äôm not just standing around jibber-jabbering.

Yes, I sometimes chat WHILE I‚ÄôM WORKING, but who doesn‚Äôt? This isn‚Äôt me bantering like we‚Äôre old friends. I‚Äôm doing my damn job and building a report with the customer, so they feel comfortable around me.

The past few months, the over exertion has caught up to me. My energy has waned, and others have noticed. According to my bosses, my work has become inefficient here and there (I can admit that), I‚Äôm less talkative and cheerful in the morning (I‚Äôm tired and stressed, and NOT a morning person), and I ‚Äúact like I don‚Äôt like my job‚Äù. First they claim I talk too much, then get concerned I don‚Äôt talk anymore. I can‚Äôt win and I refuse to play.

They know of my second job, but they say it doesn‚Äôt excuse my behavior. I told them it doesn‚Äôt, but it DOES explain it. All I can do is try harder in the future. I keep my personal business to myself and that bothers them. GOOD. My life, my decisions.

I enjoy the job. I really do. I love seeing my progress and helping people. It‚Äôs the bureaucratic B.S and discontented treatment I‚Äôm sick of. My coworkers all secretly agree. No job is worth this degradation. I‚Äôm done.

A few months ago, one of Dirk‚Äôs best friends died in a car accident. Dirk played basketball with this boy and I‚Äôd always see him when Dirk had friends over.

Our living room has stuff I and Rufus like, Rufus has some Star Wars and robotics stuff in the living room that can‚Äôt fit in our rooms.

Dirk and our parents were out at some basketball thing for Dirk, they had picked Rufus and he came in the house alone. I told my boyfriend to relax, but once Rufus called Dirk a ‚Äúc\*\*\*k lover‚Äù he got up and started to tell Rufus to shut up. They had a screaming match before Rufus went in his room.  
  
I told him that he knows Rufus says bigoted stuff, like using the n word on his video games. Our parents have tried therapy and inclusivity training and taking his phone but nothing has worked, this has been an issue since he was 8-9. I told him I‚Äôve given up on Rufus but he said I should still try, and he asked how I would feel if someone attacked me for being gay. I told him Rufus has used the f slur before and he asked me why I‚Äôve hidden that from him.   
  
Since then, my boyfriend says he only wants to meet at his house and not my house anymore and he‚Äôs saying I need to ‚Äúgrow a backbone‚Äù.

Dirk and our parents were out at some basketball thing for Dirk, they had picked Rufus and he came in the house alone. I told my boyfriend to relax, but once Rufus called Dirk a ‚Äúc\*\*\*k lover‚Äù he got up and started to tell Rufus to shut up. They had a screaming match before Rufus went in his room.  
  
I told him that he knows Rufus says bigoted stuff, like using the n word on his video games. Our parents have tried therapy and inclusivity training and taking his phone but nothing has worked, this has been an issue since he was 8-9. I told him I‚Äôve given up on Rufus but he said I should still try, and he asked how I would feel if someone attacked me for being gay. I told him Rufus has used the f slur before and he asked me why I‚Äôve hidden that from him.   
  
Since then, my boyfriend says he only wants to meet at his house and not my house anymore and he‚Äôs saying I need to ‚Äúgrow a backbone‚Äù. He said I need to learn to ‚Äústick up for Dirk‚Äù in the future and how Dirk would be a great BIL but Rufus would be a terrible one. I told him it‚Äôs not that simple but he just rolls his eyes at me. AITA?",1.0,0.011595645,0,0

My BF recently is in recovery due to his relapse. During this relapse he hung out with friend A‚Äôs family and stuff was said and done that I‚Äôm not happy with. He knows where he messed up and feels horrible for it. We were separated during this time, but I was worried about him every day. Friend A was the only person who checked in on me during this period.

9,1cnn8bt,AITA for publicly calling out my co-worker for her weird behavior?,"I (22M) have been working at a fairly new restaurant for about 6 months now.  The owners are nice and the staff get a long  well since it is a family owned business and not a part of a corporation.  I work in the kitchen along with a few other guys, let‚Äôs call the guy on fryer Evan (fake name).  Evan was this really kind guy that would go out of his way to help you, just really great guy in general.  He had a heart condition that caused him to have seizures somewhat often among other things.  Last week, Evan unfortunately passed away due to his condition and the staff/owners have been arranging things with Evans family to help him during this hard time.  

Evan had passed a few days before his birthday and one of the servers and Evan had planned to do something together to celebrate it since they‚Äôd both be working on his birthday.  She had made Evan a cake prior to his death, so on his birthday all of the staff and family come to celebrate his birthday and life.  This is where ‚ÄòFiona‚Äô comes in (fake name).  Fiona is a server that has been working with Evan and myself for a few months now. 

At the celebration, Fiona was quite upset (understandably) and was inconsolable for most of the time.  There was a few words said, mainly by the family, some staff and by the restaurant owners but also by Fiona.  Her message started off normal until it turned weird?  She began talking about how her and Evan were work husband and wife and how she will miss seeing him every time they worked together.  The issue was that Evan‚Äôs fianc√©e and Fiona‚Äôs boyfriend were both in attendance.  The fianc√©e obviously was upset from the fact she had lost Evan but now Fiona saying that she was his work wife at his celebration of life.  

All of the staff were in shock at this, Fiona was a few drinks deep and she was a bit of a messy drunk but no one had expected her to say that.  After she said this in front of everybody, another co-worker of ours managed to get the mic out of her hands and to head home.  Nobody had mentioned it for the rest of the night because of just not knowing how to process her sobbing about missing her work husband.  Today though, we had a shift together and we naturally didn‚Äôt talk that much due to working in different areas of the restaurant but she had been acting off and still very sad. I had heard from another server that she was still going on about how hard Evans death has been on here as his work wife and that she should‚Äôve received time 

I‚Äôm not too sure why I took it so personally but I asked her in front of all of the staff that was working (most since it was a busier night) why she was acting like she was his actual wife.  She got upset saying I had no right to talk to her like I did, especially about Evan, and that I was a prick.  We exchanged some words then avoided each other for the rest of our shifts.

Recently, we had been talking, idk how we got on the conversation but he had said something about how sometimes my lack of motivation rubs off on him. 

I wasn't quite sure what he meant so I asked if he could explain further. He gave me the examples that I still live with my parents, I'm not in college, and it seems I have a distinct lack of motivation to follow my art career. He continued to say that he'd probably not talk to me much once he moved since he wanted to be surrounded by more people like him. Fair enough. 

He continued on to say he had talked to his other friends about how he felt with my lack of motivation as well. And that they described my behavior as a 'leech'. It had seriously hurt my feelings and I didn't know what to say, or if I was being stupid not understanding. 

I asked him if he would be comfortable if I brought our short-term mutual friend in to see if he could better explain it to me or understand better. He agreed, and I also asked said friend if he'd be comfortable in conversation. 

He also didn't seem to be understanding, I was still upset, when I get upset I clam up and it's hard for me to speak. I began texting M saying that I felt like leech was a little too much, and hurt my feelings.

16,1cnm536,AITA for telling my friend I don‚Äôt think that she can be a doctor?,"Hi hello, here is my dilemma. 

Recently, my (24F) best friend (24F) and I were speaking about her career ambitions. She has been saying for the past several years that she wants to be a doctor. Her main reasons for wanting such a thing are, in addition to being able to help people, making a lot of money and ‚Äúgetting to be the one in charge.‚Äù Those things are all rather consistent with her personality. She asked me if I thought that she could become a doctor and I definitely hesitated to provide an answer, which put us in a rocky position. 

Originally, she had joined our college as a student in the nursing program, but she failed out about a year ago due to not making passing grades for the program requirements. She was absolutely heartbroken about this and appealed to no avail, and I was supportive of her as much as a friend can be in helping her look at alternative educational pathways. Nevertheless, she doubled down on the fact that she wanted to be a doctor, and decided to pursue a career in the sciences as a stepping stone regardless. The other thing is, she‚Äôs never made that great of grades. She‚Äôs been pretty consistent in a B-C average the entire time we‚Äôve been in school together. 

So, when she asked me, I was honest with her and told her that medical school is a really advanced academic pursuit, and I wasn‚Äôt sure that her grades would allow her to actually take that career path. She was, understandably, offended and commented that me saying that just made her want to do it even more. She definitely seemed hurt. She mentioned thinking that she could get by on the interview portion of applications, so I tried explaining to her that medical schools will more than likely screen out her application based on her GPA.

I think I could be an asshole because I told my best friend that I don‚Äôt think that she can achieve her career pursuits, and that was hurtful towards her. I‚Äôve never struggled in school the way that she has, and have earned academic accolades at a state and national level and am on track to graduate some form of cum laude on the president‚Äôs honor roll. I‚Äôve always had a hunch that she‚Äôs been at least somewhat resentful of how naturally academics have come to me.

19,1cnlxam,AITA for not wanting to get down to the brass tax with my ex about shared car?,"I've gone through a really rough and prolonged breakup with a partner. Before the breakup, we had been living together for years. During that time, I had my own car that I bought under my name. We both have low income, so we worked out a deal where we split the insurance, gas and any repairs we had to do on the car. Going into the agreement, they mentioned that the only kind of repairs they may not want to contribute to are ones that would be major investments that would contribute to the long term value of the car. The plan was never that we would share the car indefinitely, so that seemed like a reasonable boundary to me.

Fast forward to this past year and a half, outside of car stuff, they went through a lot of personal turmoil that was really intense, and our relationship fell apart. After a year of trying to make it work, while they were presenting very difficult behaviour, I finally moved out. Since moving out, we've still been sharing the car. Despite the breakup being heartbreaking, it's still been amicable, and I live nearby so it's been mutually beneficial.

NOW, I have just gotten some big career news, and I need to relocate to another part of town by next month. Given the distance, it doesn't make sense for us to keep sharing this car, so I kindly let them know that I'd need to take the car back as mine. I could tell they were emotional to hear this update, and they blurted out that they wanted to talk about the repair expenses that have gone into the car since we've been sharing it. There have been some bigger expenses, like brake maintenance that's been around $1300 a couple times over the years, and tire replacements, but it's been a year since we got those updates. The only recent maintenance has been repairing an exhaust leak a couple months ago that cost a few hundred bucks.

23,1cnlgj8,AITA for doing the laundry and not following the rules?,"I'm 18F with divorced parents since 15. My dad remarried (less than a year later), and my mom remained single. Even after turning 18 a couple of months ago, I've still been following the court schedule because I don't want to be away from my siblings.

I have a cat at my dad's house, and today she threw up on my bed sheets. I went to go put them in the wash. When I left my room to do so, my dad's wife looked at me and asked, ""Are you washing those right now?"" I said yes, and she replied, ""Okay, go ahead.""

Later, I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer, and that's when my dad's wife asked me, ""Is it your laundry day?"" (she had designated laundry days, I do my laundry on Sunday night before school.) I explained that my cat had thrown up on my sheets, so I needed to wash them since I was going to my mom's later and didn't want my room to smell.

She then started to throw a fit, and I got fed up. I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer and called my dad to ask what the big deal was with her. While passing his wife to go to my room while I was still talking to him, she told me, ""Sit down and talk, don't give me any attitude."" I responded that I was on the phone with my dad, to which she replied, ""Oh, don't worry I'll call him up later as well.""

When I sat in my room to continue talking to him, I told him what had happened. He blew up on me, saying, I'm not the only person in the house with laundry emergencies (even though no one else needed to do laundry at the time), I'm trying to break his marriage apart and have been for years (I never did anything and stay in my room 24/7 at my dads), no one wants me in the house, my therapy sessions are BS as I give everyone else problems (despite my suffering from panic attacks and depression), Why don't you just go live with your mom? I don't know why you're still in my house (even though I'm here for my siblings), and finally, ""Respect my wife and speak to her.""

I'm 18F with divorced parents since 15. My dad remarried (less than a year later), and my mom remained single. Even after turning 18 a couple of months ago, I've still been following the court schedule because I don't want to be away from my siblings.

I have a cat at my dad's house, and today she threw up on my bed sheets. I went to go put them in the wash. When I left my room to do so, my dad's wife looked at me and asked, ""Are you washing those right now?"" I said yes, and she replied, ""Okay, go ahead.""

Later, I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer, and that's when my dad's wife asked me, ""Is it your laundry day?"" (she had designated laundry days, I do my laundry on Sunday night before school.) I explained that my cat had thrown up on my sheets, so I needed to wash them since I was going to my mom's later and didn't want my room to smell.

She then started to throw a fit, and I got fed up. I went to transfer the sheets to the dryer and called my dad to ask what the big deal was with her. While passing his wife to go to my room while I was still talking to him, she told me, ""Sit down and talk, don't give me any attitude."" I responded that I was on the phone with my dad, to which she replied, ""Oh, don't worry I'll call him up later as well.""

When I sat in my room to continue talking to him, I told him what had happened. He blew up on me, saying, I'm not the only person in the house with laundry emergencies (even though no one else needed to do laundry at the time), I'm trying to break his marriage apart and have been for years (I never did anything and stay in my room 24/7 at my dads), no one wants me in the house, my therapy sessions are BS as I give everyone else problems (despite my suffering from panic attacks and depression), Why don't you just go live with your mom? I don't know why you're still in my house (even though I'm here for my siblings), and finally, ""Respect my wife and speak to her.""

As her 40th birthday approached, 40f decided that this was the year to have a ‚Äúgiving back‚Äù party. She said she didn‚Äôt want any presents, but she wanted us to bring items to donate to a local residential facility for women and children.  We were to wrap our donations as if they were birthday presents and the party was timed so that the residents would receive gifts and unwrap them in our presence before we had to leave. She was providing a Happy UnBirthday cake that the residents could enjoy together, and cards and envelopes so the residents could write thank you notes to her.

I felt that the party was kind of performative. I didn‚Äôt critique the party to her or anyone except my husband and children, though.

I was prepared for her being angry, because she always is when I tell her No, but I was not prepared for the rest of the family being upset with me for not warning them I wouldn‚Äôt be attending. She had called everyone bad names because only one local cousin showed up, plus a few of the people she supervises at her work.

We have been together for 2+ years now and I moved in after MIL offered me to around the 6 month mark of me and my partner dating. My home life is messed up, which is why she offered to let me move in (I think anyway, my partner told her about my past and that‚Äôs when she offered so I think that‚Äôs why).

Anyways, a few weeks ago my partner and I had left for a 2-week long camping trip. Prior to leaving I had asked MIL if she could watch my 3 cats, and I told her that if she didn‚Äôt want to I could get my brother to come and care for them. 

She said there was no need for my brother to come and she would care for them. When we got back I went down to the basement to put away our camping stuff and found cat litter EVERYWHERE.

She never cleaned the litter while I was gone! There was cat pee and poop all over the carpet. I went upstairs and asked MIL why she didn‚Äôt clean the cat litter and she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my responsibly.‚Äù - I told her that she said she would watch them and that means she should‚Äôve cleaned the cat litter, and that if she didn‚Äôt want to, she could have told me so I could get my brother to do it.

She got defensive and I just ignored her and tried to clean up the carpet. I even rented a steam cleaner but nothing worked and there is still a smell and some stains.

Yesterday, MIL told me that I have to pay to replace the carpets because the cat pee smell won‚Äôt come out. I told her no because she should have cleaned their litter box after she said she would watch my cats.

My partner and I have been arguing about it since because MIL is complaining to him about me. I have started to look for apartments now.

So, I (M22) am dating my girlfriend of eight months (F21). The problem is the following:

Today, I decided to the movie theater with my siblings as I treat. I've been struggling with university time management and exams lately, so I haven't had the time to relax except for watching shows in the evenings before bed. I always make sure to text my girlfriend throughout the day because we both enjoy it. For the last days, she seemed down and mentioned she felt a bit sad lately. However, and I might be in the wrong here, I didn't ask specifically ask why and instead, told her several times that I was sorry she felt that way and that I wished I could take her sadness away. 

I told her that I'd go to the movie theater to watch a movie. She mentioned she'd missed me and I told her I'd miss her as well. Then, I turned off my phone and enjoyed the film. Three hours later, I texted her that I was now free. Instead of asking me about the movie or how I was as she usually would, she sent a simple text message. I asked her what was wrong and she said she felt on a low mood.

Now, this is where I might be the AH. But I genuinely didn't wanted to let me mood be ruined by this (I finally got to relax after weeks, I didn't wanted to ruin it). So instead, I turned off my phone and talked to my friends that came along about the movie. Then, as I arrived home, I turned on my phone to tell her that I got home. I realized that she wasn't being as enthusiastic as before when telling me about her day and I realized that I hadn't asked her how her day went. When I did, she replied shortly, which isn't normal. So I asked her what was wrong. Then she said that she was sad and wasn't in the mood to talk, which made me upset because I wanted to talk to her before bed (I find it relaxing and sweet). She said she loved me and that she hoped I rested well. And that I could tell her about the movie tomorrow because she felt drained.

I asked her why and she said that she missed me throughout the day and wanted to talk to me but I was busy with lessons (I forgot to because I was focused and stressed). So I asked her why she didn't wanted to now, and she said that she knew I'd doze off and not listen clearly as always. She said that her 'excitement expired' and wanted to talk tomorrow instead. I insisted on solving this before going to bed but she just said goodnight and is now offline. I'm upset at the situation and really don't understand what I did wrong.

I signed and helped them with the deposit.

My 'boyfriend' and I had just stopped talking for a while. About a little over a week ago I sent him a text asking him how he was doing this. I did this because I was bored and I kinda missed him. He texted me back and we just started talking. I was in my 5th block during the time and I heard one of my classmates bringing up graduation. I hadn't seen him in a while and in my thought process I thought this could be used as an opportunity to see him again. I sent him a text asking him if he was coming to my brothers graduation because from my knowledge I thought they were still friends. 

But when I sent that he sent me a text saying ""I wasn't invited üëç""  that caught me off guard and I tried to like back track a little bit but he still wasn't happy. I told him that he didn't need an invitation to come but he just told me that ""I'm not gonna go somewhere when he aint even ask me to come fr"" 

I didn't know what to say after that as he was kinda upset. I tried to talk about it somemore but he just kinda dismissed me and told me that he'll *think* about coming for me but won't guarantee it. 

But after we stopped texting I'm assuming he blocked my brother or sometime after. I'm not sure if it was sometime later or right after but I'm not sure because my brother only noticed yesteday that he was blocked. He was confused on why he couldn't get in touch with him and I tried my best to be honest with him and told him that I mentioned his graduation to my 'boyfriend' and he wasn't happy about not being asked to come to his graduation.

My brother was mad at me and told me that I shouldn't of mentioned anything to him and told me that he didn't know if his friend wanted to come or not because they haven't been talking as frequent any more. 

I apologized to him but he was still mad at me and asked me to talk to my 'boyfriend' to get him unblocked but I had already did that and he told me that he was hurt that he wasn't thought of because he knows  that their other friends were coming and he didn't want to be friends with someone like that.

34,1cnjox5,AITA for parking our car in front of our driveway when it blocks our neighbors truck? ,"AITA for parking our car on the street when it blocks our neighbors truck

We have a really good relationship with all our neighbors, which is a priority for our family. The neighors across the street are especially great, and we enjoy chatting with them. I was very touched recently when my dad (who also lived on our street) passed and they attended his service. They cried with my mom, brought soup for her, and are just really great people. All that to say, I really don't want to be an A-hole as I value our relationship. 

For years, they have parked their large delivery trucks in their drive way and sometimes on the street in front of their house - this has never been an issue. However, they recently got a new delivery truck that is much larger than the previous ones - so much so that to get it out of their driveway the turn is so wide the truck comes to our curb and grazes the front of our driveway. 

We recently put up a basketball hoop in our driveway for our 4 young kids, aged 4-9, and when they play during the day, I've been parking our van at the front of our driveway, parallel to the street but blocking our driveway so the basketball doesn't roll into the street when they play (and so our kids don't chase it into the street).

Our neighbor messaged us to let us know that when we park like that, it's almost impossible for them to get the delivery truck in and out of their driveway (our driveway is not facing theirs, but the truck has a really wide turn). As I was watching them pull out this morning, I realized that if we have a car parked on the street really anywhere in front of our house, it will be impossible for them to pull their truck out. 

I don't want to be limited to keeping our van only in our driveway, as I want my kids to be able to play there especially as the weather gets better. We bought this particular house to enable our kids to play outside. I also want my guests to be able to park in front of our house, which will now be an issue. I feel like our neighbors should have considered that they wouldn't be able to get that large truck in and out of their driveway if anyone is parked on the street, and considered that before they got such a large commercial vehicle to park on our residential street. However, I also know that that ship has sailed - they already have the truck, it affects their livlihood, and if we park in front of our house they are basically stuck.

I (47yoF) and my husband (46yoM) live with our two adult sons (22 & 19). My husband and eldest son are office workers and get home after 5pm. My youngest son and I (a plumber's apprentice and teacher) tend to finish earlier, \~ 4pm.

On Wednesday, I left work, went to the grocery store and picked up some supplies then drove home to find my son had parked his truck in my covered parking spot. at the top of our driveway. I parked behind him, unloaded the car and went inside. I asked my son why he had parked in my spot and he replied that his boss had asked him to collect some machinery for a job the next day. He reversed into my spot so as to hide the machinery from view to limit the risk of theft. I told him he would need to move my car before morning because I was blocking his exit. I then went into the kitchen, unloaded the groceries, cooked dinner, etc.

Come Thursday morning, I am getting ready for work and mentally preparing to take 64 nine year olds on an excursion (stressful!) and my husband bursts in announcing he has damaged both our cars. He was angry with himself (he said) BUT, followed up with the accusation that 'this never would have happened if (I) hadn't parked behind our son'.

Hubby and son had left the house at the same time on this morning. My son, being 19, had forgotten to move my car, he was subsequently running late for work. My husband got into his car and drove it to the end of our 2 car driveway. He then exited his car, left the driver's side door open and reversed my car down the driveway to allow my son space to manouvre around it. However, as he had left his driver's side door open, when reversing my car, his door connected with my tail light, causing damage to both cars.

The worst part of this is that this very morning, we had discussed and decided to trade my car in and upgrade to a newer model because it is WAS in pristine physical condition and had low miles for it's age... So the whole experience was very frustrating and very avoidable.

Despite several discussions since this event, my husband is adamant that I should take on board some of the responsibility for the damage for parking too close to my son and blocking his exit. In his mind, had I parked at the bottom of the driveway, our son would have been able to get around my vehicle. However I firmly believe, I was entitled to park where I did to allow easy access to the house with a load of groceries and I had spoken to my son immediately upon seeing him that evening and informed him that he would need to move my car before he left for work.

This upcoming Monday also happens to be my MILs (63f) birthday. Every year my husband (32m), and his brothers ( 29M, 25M) and FIL have celebrated both MILs birthday and Mothers Day on the same day no matter what day Mothers Day fell on that year. I was all too happy to celebrate both occasions with them because I lost my mom when I was 8 to ovarian cancer so I never really celebrated Mothers Day until I met my husband.

This year however, I would like to celebrate Mothers Day with just myself, my husband, and our daughter. I tried to encourage other plans on Saturday, a day filled with fun, food, and activities that MIL likes but have been shot down. I even asked if the three of us could do breakfast/brunch and then we go over to MILs to celebrate but this was also unacceptable. Both Mothers Day and birthday must be celebrated on the same day. I tried to talk to MIL about it but she said that this is the way it's been for years and it isn't going to change now and that maybe we (my husband and I) can do Mothers Day things another day.

So this is where I might be the asshole; I told my husband he is welcome to go and spend the whole day with his mom, dad, and brothers but I will be staying home and celebrating with the wee potato who made me a mom, we're going to watch Bluey and make tiny blueberry pancakes (her favourite, lol). My husband says I'm being unreasonable and that we can celebrate another time, that his mom just loves celebrating being a mom and her birthday together with the ones she loves and that it would be awkward if her first grandchild isn't there to help her celebrate (BILs have partners but do not have children yet). I told him I am standing firm on this and he got angry and went to our room. He's been in there for a couple of hours now and I'm starting to feel bad for putting him on the spot like that and making him choose how to celebrate.

38,1cobh2j,WIBTA for Asking My Ex to Pay Me Back the 5k He Owes Me?,"Hello everyone!

I have always been a fan of this subreddit that it is funny that now I have come here to post lol

I (23) was in a ""situationship"" with my ex (24) for about 6 years. It all began in high school, where I thought I was in love and all that crazy stuff. We went 2 years of a one sided love, took 2 year break, got back together and I ended it all last year. I noticed that I was just with him with pity and it just was not worth my time anymore. I am now happy with someone SO MUCH BETTER and who actually communicates and so much more :)

ANYWHOOO... with my ex, I always helped him in many ways. One of the main ways I helped him was financially. I was in undergrad when I started paying for meals for him and helping him in any way I could. From the time we got together again to when I ended it, in total he owes me around 5k in UberEats, clothes, school supplies (which by the way, he dropped out a semester in), and I think that is pretty much it. The UberEats is what totals about 4k from the amount owed. I would buy him meals on the daily that ranged from $20 to $50 and it really just depended on what the food items were. It burned me financially, but seeing him struggle with money had me wanting to help with the intention of getting paid back at some point.

From the last I spoke to him, he is in major debt. Credit card debt, loan debt, car debt, all of it. It is so bad, but he never really knew how to manage his money. I remember whenever we went on ""dates"" I would pay for it all. After like 5 ""dates"", we had indoor dates, so we (really I) could save money. It was just icky and will continue to be icky.

Now this is where I ask; WIBTA for asking my ex to pay me back the 5k he owes me? I have already sent an email to him with the invoices and spreadsheet of all the money he owes me and all I received was a snarky response of him dismissing the debt he has to me and comparing it to the credit card and loan debts he has. I sent another email in response, only to feel like I have been blocked. I have heard of a small court claim, but even then I feel like I am a little bit of an asshole. My friends and partner say I am not, but I wanna be sure.

Thank you guys for any responses!

  
Edit: Hi again! I have been getting asked a lot in the comments so I will just add it here! While we were dating, we both made it clear that it would be something he would pay back at some point. He would always say that he would pay me back next check, and well that never happened lol Even after we broke up, he had still agreed to pay me back as soon as he could. In fact he was the one who wanted visual of what he owed me in all that I helped him with. The excel sheet came AFTER we broke up and not during. Oh another thing that was asked if there was a written agreement. Unfortunately there was not :( it was all verbal and the only thing I can maybe use is the email where he states, ""I can agree to the price but I cannot begin returning payments until my other debts have been settled.""

It burned me financially, but seeing him struggle with money had me wanting to help with the intention of getting paid back at some point.

From the last I spoke to him, he is in major debt. Credit card debt, loan debt, car debt, all of it. It is so bad, but he never really knew how to manage his money. I remember whenever we went on ""dates"" I would pay for it all. After like 5 ""dates"", we had indoor dates, so we (really I) could save money. It was just icky and will continue to be icky.

Now this is where I ask; WIBTA for asking my ex to pay me back the 5k he owes me? I have already sent an email to him with the invoices and spreadsheet of all the money he owes me and all I received was a snarky response of him dismissing the debt he has to me and comparing it to the credit card and loan debts he has. I sent another email in response, only to feel like I have been blocked. I have heard of a small court claim, but even then I feel like I am a little bit of an asshole. My friends and partner say I am not, but I wanna be sure.

Thank you guys for any responses!

  
Edit: Hi again! I have been getting asked a lot in the comments so I will just add it here! While we were dating, we both made it clear that it would be something he would pay back at some point. He would always say that he would pay me back next check, and well that never happened lol Even after we broke up, he had still agreed to pay me back as soon as he could. In fact he was the one who wanted visual of what he owed me in all that I helped him with. The excel sheet came AFTER we broke up and not during. Oh another thing that was asked if there was a written agreement. Unfortunately there was not :( it was all verbal and the only thing I can maybe use is the email where he states, ""I can agree to the price but I cannot begin returning payments until my other debts have been settled."" (copied from actual email)! I hope this answers any questions after and I am sorry I didn't add this before hand!",0.0,0.06043366342782974,0,1
39,1cob8oh,AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?,"I (16, F) have been a part of my school's theater company since I was in middle school. Theater means a lot to me, and it's given me a community of silly, talented, amazing people that make up my core friend group. While they would get all the leads for each show (both at our school and local community theaters), I never got anything higher than an ensemble part or a part with a few lines, and it always hurt me a lot because I would feel excluded. I've never let myself feel too discouraged by this, and I've been able to do a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff for shows I'm not a huge part of, like building sets, making props, and directing. This would always be super fun, but never as fun as being onstage and being a part of all the inside jokes my other friends would bring up outside of rehearsals (and this only added to me feeling excluded).

Anyway, me and my friends all auditioned for a local teen production of Little Shop of Horrors last week, with four of us (including me) all auditioning for Audrey. We audition, and I think I do pretty well, but part of me knows I won't get the part. Well, yesterday, the cast list came out, and to my surprise, I GOT AUDREY!! I'm so excited and still buzzing over the fact that I finally have a lead, and one of my dream roles no less. All of my friends were extremely supportive and there was no tension among any of us over the results of the cast list, so I accepted the part right away before dancing around my room and going out for ice cream with my friends.

When I got back, I texted my boyfriend of a year (17, M) about the news, expecting congratulations and excitement (since he knows how big of a deal finally getting a lead is for me), but instead, he told me I should reject the part because I'd have to kiss the guy playing Seymour, and also generally act romantically around him onstage, and that makes him uncomfortable. The guy playing Seymour is one of my close friends I've known since 7th grade, and our relationship has always been purely platonic (he also has a boyfriend of his own). I can see how my boyfriend would be uncomfortable since I'd be acting romantically with someone who isn't him, and with someone I'm pretty close to. I told him I already accepted my part and he left me on read, and I don't really know how I'm feeling at the moment. I'm hurt because he hasn't congratulated me, but I feel bad for potentially hurting him and accepting the part without talking to him about how it would affect our relationship. AITA for accepting the part?

Edit: I just realized that I wrote ""play"" in the title when Little Shop of Horrors is definitely a musical. When I say I've never been more ashamed of myself I mean it wholeheartedly and I beg for forgiveness.

40,1cob6ww,WIBTA if I didn't invite my dad to my high school graduation party?,"I (17F) am graduating high school at the end of May, and have a graduation party set for one of the first Sundays in June. My mom (46F) and stepdad (37M) contributed to purchasing a small venue for the event, and my mom already confirmed to me she'd cover the costs for things like catering and invitations. I asked if my dad (58M) had contributed anything to the party, and she said no. I've asked her for updates a few times, and so far, nothing has came up. Me and my mom were even asking him to give us a list of people he wants from his side of the family to show up, and he hasn't given us even that. We're on the sending out invitations phase, which means we need to narrow down who on all sides of the family and beyond (mom, dad, stepdad, work friends, school friends, etc.) is going to be invited so we can plan accordingly.

I feel the need to mention here that my dad and I haven't always been the best of buddies. It's sort of like the stereotypical ""teenage daughter and old fashioned dad"" debacle. He's always liked my brother (18M) more. My parents got divorced in 2016 around my 10th birthday, and while I've gone between the houses almost 50/50 each week, being at my dad's is almost always harrowing. I moved out of me and my brother's shared room around 13-14, and I've been stuck on a couch in the living room since. It took a few years for him to even put blinds in the giant window in the room, which I've wanted to use as subtle leverage for him to try and at least be involved in my graduation. We've never really been close, since we like different things, have different political views, that sort of thing. While I try and be supportive of his hobbies and interests, most times when I ask him to do something related to my hobbies, I'm met with a ""maybe some other time, kiddo."" Needless to say, it's not exactly ""like father, like daughter.""

What irks me the most is that my dad is willing to front a bunch of money for him and my brother to go on their yearly weekend-ish camping trip, normally the weekend of my brother's birthday (early May). This could me just being bitter, but it still hurts. When I do try and bring these things up to him, most times I'm either written off, called ""emotional""/get told to settle down, or compared to my mother (something my dad tends to do whenever I display traits he doesn't like). I've discussed the idea with my boyfriend and some of my close friends about just not inviting him to the graduation party, but at the same time, I'm worried this will start some sort of family dumpster fire, and I really wanna avoid that. I've mentioned it briefly to my mom, and she was the one who recommended that I try and type this all out not only for my sake, but to perhaps show it to a neutral party (i.e Reddit in my case). My main concern here is that I might be overreacting, but I feel as if, since he doesn't want to contribute anything, why bother even showing up?

My daughter, 21F lives at home with me and works full time, she has saved lots of money because not once have I ever charged her rent or asked her to do any payment other than electric bill, which she is always complaining about being high. She says that she is pregnant with her first child and wants to spoil her. I understand this, but she is doing so under my roof, therefore she should be contributing.

45,1coa988,AITA for not getting a Mother‚Äôs Day gift?,"I am first generation immigrant, moved to Toronto 2 years ago. I make a decent salary, around 80K and live in Downtown. I used to live with a flatmate and share rent and utilities. My parents always wanted to visit Canada so I invited them to stay for a couple of months. For their convenience (and my own peace of mind) I took over the apartment lease from my flatmate till the time my parents are here, 3 months, and my flatmate found a short term rental elsewhere. It was nice of him to let me have the place and moved out. He will move back in once my parents are gone and we will go back to our shared arrangement.

Anyways, with rent takeover I am paying for the entire house, around $2,750 (which is a lot for me) plus utilities, with added expenses for groceries for 4 people (me, parents, sibling who is also visiting) My parents are retired and have no source of income and my sibling got laid off and is currently unemployed. Not that I expect them to pitch in to the household expenses, I feel I invited them so I should take care of their needs. They have been here for a month now and I can feel the financial stress. More than half of my paycheques goes to basic expenses - rent, groceries, utilities etc. I do try to take them out for sightseeing and dinner/drinks on weekends and that is all I can afford. 

My mom yesterday went to a mall and saw some coats. She loves to shop and is fond of buying random clothes. Back in my home country I will buy her stuff and never really discouraged her shopping. Today she asked me if I am buying her a Mother‚Äôs Day gift, and if yes, she wants a coat that she saw in the mall. 

Now to be honest, I myself have never shopped in Canada cause clothes here are expensive and I got everything I wear when I visited home last summer. I got her a handbag ($300ish), a Zara coat and some branded cosmetics as gifts when I visited them last summer. However she did not like any of those and never used it. When I asked her to give it back if she doesn‚Äôt like it, so atleast I can use it/return it, she just dismissed me. I felt it was a complete waste of money, that I could have saved for something better. 

I honestly have a bitter taste from that experience and that could be clouding my outlook on gifting her again. Had the money situation been better, I would have probably sucked it up and given her what she wants anyway. But now every dollar counts.

They both are outgoing and enjoy the lively atmosphere downtown offers.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"AITA for not getting a Mother‚Äôs Day gift? I am first generation immigrant, moved to Toronto 2 years ago. I make a decent salary, around 80K and live in Downtown. I used to live with a flatmate and share rent and utilities. My parents always wanted to visit Canada so I invited them to stay for a couple of months. For their convenience (and my own peace of mind) I took over the apartment lease from my flatmate till the time my parents are here, 3 months, and my flatmate found a short term rental elsewhere. It was nice of him to let me have the place and moved out. He will move back in once my parents are gone and we will go back to our shared arrangement.

Anyways, with rent takeover I am paying for the entire house, around $2,750 (which is a lot for me) plus utilities, with added expenses for groceries for 4 people (me, parents, sibling who is also visiting) My parents are retired and have no source of income and my sibling got laid off and is currently unemployed. Not that I expect them to pitch in to the household expenses, I feel I invited them so I should take care of their needs. They have been here for a month now and I can feel the financial stress. More than half of my paycheques goes to basic expenses - rent, groceries, utilities etc. I do try to take them out for sightseeing and dinner/drinks on weekends and that is all I can afford. 

My mom yesterday went to a mall and saw some coats. She loves to shop and is fond of buying random clothes. Back in my home country I will buy her stuff and never really discouraged her shopping. Today she asked me if I am buying her a Mother‚Äôs Day gift, and if yes, she wants a coat that she saw in the mall. 

Now to be honest, I myself have never shopped in Canada cause clothes here are expensive and I got everything I wear when I visited home last summer. I got her a handbag ($300ish), a Zara coat and some branded cosmetics as gifts when I visited them last summer. However she did not like any of those and never used it. When I asked her to give it back if she doesn‚Äôt like it, so atleast I can use it/return it, she just dismissed me. I felt it was a complete waste of money, that I could have saved for something better. 

I honestly have a bitter taste from that experience and that could be clouding my outlook on gifting her again. Had the money situation been better, I would have probably sucked it up and given her what she wants anyway. But now every dollar counts. 

Would I be an asshole if I tell her I can‚Äôt afford to gift (I would have to dip into my savings which I don‚Äôt want to) or just suck it up and gift her anyways?

46,1coa5z4,"AITA for expecting housemates to pay utility bills & split dishwasher cost, despite their claims of unfairness & threats to move out?","AITA for expecting my housemates to pay their share of the utility bills, even though they claim it's 'unfair' because they use less water and electricity, but still benefit from the WiFi and Netflix subscription I pay for, which they use constantly, and also refuse to contribute to the replacement of the broken dishwasher, which they've been using for months, despite agreeing to split the cost initially, and now they're threatening to move out and leave me with the entire rent and bills to pay alone?

I'm at my wit's end and need some perspective on a ridiculously complicated situation with my housemates. I've been living with three others in a four-bedroom house for over a year now. We initially split the rent and utility bills evenly, but things have taken a turn for the worse.

Here's the backstory:

- We set up a joint account for utility bills (electricity, water, gas, internet, and Netflix).
- I pay the rent directly to the landlord, while my housemates transfer their share to me each month.
- We agreed to split the utility bills equally, despite knowing our usage varies (e.g., I work from home, while they're out most days).
- A few months ago, the dishwasher broke. We discussed replacing it and agreed to split the cost (around $500).
- Fast forward to today: my housemates are refusing to pay their share of the utility bills, claiming it's 'unfair' since they use less water and electricity. However, they still benefit from the WiFi and Netflix subscription I pay for, which they use constantly.
- To make matters worse, they're now threatening to move out if I don't absorb their share of the utility bills and the dishwasher cost. This would leave me with the entire rent and bills to pay alone, which is unsustainable for me.

Here's where it gets even more complicated:

- One housemate (let's call them Rich) has been consistently late with their rent payments, often requiring reminders and follow-ups.
- Another housemate (let‚Äôs call them Smellybutt) has a habit of leaving their devices charging for extended periods, which I believe contributes to higher electricity bills.
- The third housemate (‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Cook‚Äù) has been using the broken dishwasher, despite knowing it's not working efficiently, and now expects me to cover the entire replacement cost.

I've tried reasoning with them, explaining that we agreed to split the costs equally, and that it's not just about individual usage. However, they're refusing to budge, and tensions are running high.

So, AITAH for expecting my housemates to honor our initial agreement and pay their fair share, or are they the assholes for trying to take advantage of me and leave me with an unfair burden?""",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"AITA for expecting housemates to pay utility bills & split dishwasher cost, despite their claims of unfairness & threats to move out?

49,1coa0qb,AITA for getting rid of my dead father's car against my brother's wishes?,"My sister and I (19f) are twins.

We have an older brother (37).

You probably notice the age difference. My brother is a very stereotypical only child who has always got his way and our family has enabled his bad behavior his entire life. No matter the inconvenience something may be for others, he has to have his way or he pouts and throws adult tantrums. (Ex: Mom died last year. Sister and I got the funeral arranged, he didn't come to help, until we told him we were going with a cheaper casket. It was still nice, but it worked better for our budget. He cried about it until we got her a nicer one that put us back a few thousand. No he didn't make up the difference).

Our dad actually passed two months after our birth. He was repairing his first vehicle with my brother prior to his death. Now that car has sat in the garage for 20ish years. It's a two car garage, but the lawn mower and snowblower take up one part, while the broken car takes up another.

My brother has insisted this entire time he'll fix it. Our mom wanted to get rid of it. He threw a fit, so she kept it. After mom died, sister wanted to get rid of it so one of us can finally park our cars in the garage. Brother said he'd try to find someone to work on it. Nothing ever came of that. 

I'm leaving for college and my sister had been pressured by brother to stay living at the house. We had actually chose to sell our portion, as we didn't want to stay living there, but brother refused to sell his portion. He was threatening to divorce his wife if she didn't move into the house with him, so my sister ended up staying so that wouldn't happen (again, everyone enables him). I want to at least get rid of the car before leaving, and my friend offered to haul it for free. I no longer talk to my brother, but for this I let him know and told him it was unlikely the car is repairable, its taking a spot for sister's car, and I'll give him 60 days to find a place to store it or else it's gone.

He flipped out on me, but also got sister involved. Due to his constant whiny and texting, she is now telling me I should have just shut my mouth and let the car stay because he's going to keep pouting to her.

I (15f) have a brother (14m). This whole post happened last weekend.

My friends were over, and my brother had a friend over as well. They were playing video games using the big screen in a cinema room in our house (I don't understand why they needed all that when they could do that literally anywhere else).

Well, eventually my friends and I wanted to watch movies, and when we went into the room, they were still there. I asked them if they could leave, and they said no. I will admit, that wasn't really the answer i wanted to hear, so i told them that they were many other tvs they could use in the house to play video games. And before anyone comes after me for being ""hypocritical,"" the cinema room is literally supposed to be used for watching movies.

More and more back anf forth, blah blah blah, and my parents come in since we're almost basically yellign at each other. They did make my brother move (but once my friends left, they got mad at me) since they didn't want to make my friends and his friend more uncomfortable than they already seemed.

Because of this, my brother keeps giving me shit about it, and keeps it all to himself. We've been aruging about it for the last few days.

So basically me (f16) and my friend (f16 also) we both go to the same school and are in the same class so basically we do everything together and go everywhere together. So one day she randomly tells me some guy texted her on insta and obvi she showed me him and stuff and i went ""omg hes cute"" and we both started texting him and we voice called him on insta and we talked for like 2 hrs and he clearly liked talking to me cuz he literally told me he thought i was the funnier one and that he liked talking to me and then i told her basically that i kinda like him and i ask if she would mention me to him more often and if she could get us to talk somehow and then she says sure, and we go on about our day. Flash forward a few days,hes constantly texting her and she keeps talking to him and about him all while knowing i like him,so obvi it made me very upset but i was like ""ok maybe they're just friends"" because she had a bf at the time  who she'd been dating for like 10 months at that point. But suddenly a few days later i find out from a mutual friend of ours that she broke up w her bf randomly (which is weird considering she just started texting this new guy alot) so obvi i ask her abt it and she tells me she dumped him cuz ""they were loosing touch cuz they're in diff schools"" which i thought was weird timing but i didnt care that much.

(Sorry for bad english its not my first language) Am i the asshole?
So basically me (f16) and my friend (f16 also) we both go to the same school and are in the same class so basically we do everything together and go everywhere together. So one day she randomly tells me some guy texted her on insta and obvi she showed me him and stuff and i went ""omg hes cute"" and we both started texting him and we voice called him on insta and we talked for like 2 hrs and he clearly liked talking to me cuz he literally told me he thought i was the funnier one and that he liked talking to me and then i told her basically that i kinda like him and i ask if she would mention me to him more often and if she could get us to talk somehow and then she says sure, and we go on about our day. Flash forward a few days,hes constantly texting her and she keeps talking to him and about him all while knowing i like him,so obvi it made me very upset but i was like ""ok maybe they're just friends"" because she had a bf at the time  who she'd been dating for like 10 months at that point. But suddenly a few days later i find out from a mutual friend of ours that she broke up w her bf randomly (which is weird considering she just started texting this new guy alot) so obvi i ask her abt it and she tells me she dumped him cuz ""they were loosing touch cuz they're in diff schools"" which i thought was weird timing but i didnt care that much.

He works a difficult job that requires travel, and is gone for one week and returns for one. He‚Äôs the obvious breadwinner.

My husband blows off steam by spending money. After paying bills and mortgage, he spends roughly 80% of what‚Äôs left over within the first week. It‚Äôs spent on fun things for himself such as games, clothes, and he has a card collection. It‚Äôs his money, and I‚Äôm not contesting that. He‚Äôs free to spend it however he wishes to spend it, however, we have home repairs and sometimes I have an unexpected expense I can‚Äôt always cover such as car troubles. 

Groceries have been increasingly expensive as of late, and I find myself having trouble paying for our dates on top of my own bills such as my car insurance and phone bill. Usually for our date night, we go out to eat then do a fun activity together. We go on date nights when he‚Äôs back roughly twice a week. This has been our routine for years now. 

Recently, we‚Äôve had home repairs he‚Äôs neglected. I can‚Äôt afford to fix it, and this has always been his job. We‚Äôve always agreed on expenses and he knows that when things break down, he‚Äôs the one that pays to get it fixed. He‚Äôs told me that he‚Äôll get it fixed for weeks now, and hasn‚Äôt.

He didn‚Äôt seem to notice immediately, but once the new paycheck came and he began talking about all the things he‚Äôs going to buy, I got angry. 

I told him that I didn‚Äôt care about his promotion since it won‚Äôt make a difference anyways.

I called him lazy, immature and selfish during our argument. He called me a leech, gold digger, and manipulative for telling him what to do with his money.

I don‚Äôt care what he does with his money, I just want essentials that he said he‚Äôd take care of taken care of first.

58,1co85fm,AITA for showing my grandchildren old video tapes of their dad when he was bugging them about their generation?,"All of this is light hearted. Nobody is going no contact or getting divorced. Sorry for the lack of drama. Just an honest question.  

My son and his family were visiting last weekend. My grandchildren were making videos and goofing off on my quads and such. 

At dinner my son was making fun of his kids for recording everything and doing stupid stuff. His kids were bugging him back calling him a boomer.  That's kind of funny because I am a boomer. On the youngest end of that generation but still a boomer. 

In fact such a boomer that I am a packrat with boxes full of obselete tech and cables I might need again. 

In one of those boxes I had a VHS player and a conversion cable that let me use RCA outputs (yellow, white, and red) and connect to my TV's HDMI port. And I have a box full of old VHS-C tapes and an adapter. 

I asked for some help from my grandkids and we set up the machine and a selection of tapes. I even found the remote. It felt good. Like something that had been missing from my hand. New remotes feel flimsy. 

We all sat down to watch. My sin started getting nervous. I think he forgot I had receipts. 

I found his Jackass videos, videos of him surfing in the back of his friend's pickup. Videos of him unironically singing along to In Sync. 

My daughter in law was giggling. Until we got to the videos of her. She has been friends with my son even before they started dating. Her fashion sense and hairstyle choices were ""interesting"". 

We also unfortunately found videos of me with an ill advised moustache. And an old acid wash jean jacket I regret. My wife looked as beautiful as she always has. Lucky bum. 

We spent about an hour laughing bat the old videos and my son was laughing as hard as anyone. 

He also said I was a dick for undermining his high ground with my grandchildren.

He became practically a member of our family and was very often at our house. Eric doesn't have much of a family of his own so he spent christmas and other festivities with us every year. My mom always liked him a I love him. It is not that I am attracted to him in a romantic or sexual way. I mean, yes I am but that is not an issue because I know I will never have a chance with him. 

He is the only positive male figure in my life and one of my few real friends. We have a lot of shared cultural interests and I love talking with him. I never had a boyfriend or have been close to it. I am not super depressed about it as I could find some guy if I lower my expectations but I don't want to do that. I am not ugly and my face with makeup looks solid. I am not fat but I am definitely not skinny either. My sister is way more atractive than me.

June and Eric broke up recently. It was friendly, neither of them did anything bad, they just wanted different things in the long run. I got the vibe he was the one that technically dumped her and I can't deny that image made me smile a little. I miss him deeply and texted him a few times but I had mostly come to peace with the fact that he only cared about me because he was dating my sister and there is no reason for us to talk anymore.

My parents got divorced when I was a baby. My dad has a different family far away and I barely have a relationship with him.

I told him he could come if he wanted as we had an empty seat because my dad didn't care if I live or die. He said he wouldn't want to annoy June but I just lied and told him I had already asked her and she was fine with it.

It is fine by me, she is the one acting like a child and I am not going to cater to her whims. My graduation is in two weeks. She is free come if she wants but if she doesn't it isn't my fault.

This sounds bad on the surface but let me explain, my social awkwardness had nothing to do with the conversation but they felt it was a leading cause. The ‚Äúpushing for buying a car and getting a job‚Äù just flat out wasn‚Äôt true. He offered to help me check out used cars on FB marketplace to see if they needed any maintenance (he worked with cars) and I said yes because he was excited to help me with a big step. The job was a job I got that he didn‚Äôt even tell me to apply to, it was a job I applied to as soon as I turned 16, and I got it, but he made it seem like he was the one who had to make me get the job by constantly talking about how I needed to apply everywhere I could and get a job as soon as possible (keep in mind I applied for this job before he even started this as well as I applied to like 7 others just in case).

Finally the college loan, he offered to co-sign, then he tried to fill it out but didn‚Äôt understand it was a yearly loan not a 4-year loan so he changed the amount for a full 4-year tuition. I tried to change it back, but it already got sent in for approval, and when it came back as a $40,000 approval, they were furious with me for trying to have so much approved.

I(m19) have had an off and on mother over the years. Some days she's nice but then when I'm misbehaving she's abusive. I can't say what she did because otherwise I can't post this but it was pretty bad. When I was 16 my parents divorced and I ended up living with my dad because she couldn't take me. 

When I was out of high school and met a woman and moved in with her. We were talking for one week and met up four times. The first time we met my mom also met her and it was also the first time in like months that I've actually seen my mom. I didn't even see my mom on my graduation day. Not really. When we got there I could immediately tell she had a problem with my girlfriend, even though there was nothing wrong with her. And when we got home that night my mom proceeded to play FBI agent and invade her privacy. She never really cared before so I don't really understand why she cared so much now. 

She should know that I'm a grown man now and that I've got a woman in my life that I'm paying my attention to so why she decided to do what she did next I have no idea. It was her birthday one weekend when me and my girlfriend were having a date and I completely forgot as I'm not really keeping track of it right now, and my mom decided to cut me off from her life because how dare I forget her birthday.

66,1co6738,AITA for not wanting my sister to show up in Lolita fashion to my graduation party?,"Hi Reddit.

I (28) just had an argument with my sister (24). In summer there will be my graduation party (It's not really a party, more like a ball/prom) . Everyone will be earing evening attire. It's very important to me because this ball will mark me becoming a lawyer along with all my friends from university.

My sister really likes to wear lolita fashion and usually I fully support it (I have bought her many gifts for her birthday, christmas etc of very cute things she can use for this hobby). She said she will be wearing her very new and expensive Lolita dress. She showed me a picture of her wearing it along with stockings, lolita shoes etc. While I think it looks very cute, I just don't think it'll be appropriate to wear on my graduation ball. I told her this and she had a major tantrum, telling me I don't support who she is and that she will wear whatever she wants.

I'm really thinking about telling her that I don't want her to be there if she will wear Lolita fashion.

I'm very devasteted because I feel like an asshole but at the same time I don't think that it's inappropriate of me wanting her to wear something that fits the occasion. After all it's MY graduation, something I worked YEARS for to achieve (especially after I had a major injury in the first few semesters and had to fight my way through all the pain and push through to graduate after loosing over one year) . This ball is super important to me and I... I kinda don't want my sister to ruin it by being the (negative) center of the attention.

I have told her that if she wants to wear her Lolita dress then she won't be invited to my graduation party. She thinks this is extremely mean of me, especially me being her sister. She wants to attend the party really badly. You have to have tickets for the ball (and one of us graduating students has to buy the tickets in person) and I told her I will only buy her a ticket if she wears something appropriate.

My parents are on my side, however my best friend, my sisters bf and my aunt think I'm being too hard on her and that I'm being selfish for not wanting to invite her if she wears that dress.

I don't know what to do. AITA?

P.S: She doesn't only wear lolita fashion. She wears ""normal"" clothes as well (for her job and 90% of the time in everyday life). I know that she also has a few evening dresses that she bought with me while shopping or got handed down from my mom and aunt.

I (28M) recently had a falling out with my brother (32M). He's always been bad with money management and often asks to borrow money from me. I've lent him money in the past, but he's never paid me back on time, if at all. This has caused tension in our relationship.

Recently, he asked to borrow a significant amount of money to cover some expenses. I declined, citing our past experiences and expressing concerns about his repayment track record. He became upset and accused me of being selfish and unsupportive. He argues that as family, I should be there for him in times of need.

Additional Details:

My brother has a history of overspending on non-essential items, which has put him in financial trouble multiple times. Despite my advice and attempts to help him budget, he continues to make poor financial decisions.

I have my own financial responsibilities and goals, and lending money to my brother would strain my own budget and potentially jeopardize my financial stability.

I worry that continuing to bail him out would only enable his irresponsible behavior and prevent him from learning to manage his finances more responsibly.

Despite our disagreements about money, I still care about my brother and want to support him in other ways, but I'm hesitant to continue enabling his financial irresponsibility.

68,1co5d5u,AITA or too sensitive?,"So yesterday I (M45) had a busy day running errands with my elderly Mom. She is sick and will be moving out of the country in about 2 weeks. The day before I made sure to speak to my spouse (F45) and asked if I could use the car or if she needed it. Explained to her that I would be helping my mom pack and the I would take her to a doctor's appointment after. 

She said it would be OK and we agreed that I'd call her at around four to let her know if I'd be back in time to pick upmour daughter from school.
SonI spent the day helping pack and then I took my mom to her appointment which ran a bit long and then coming back I got stuck in traffic and ultimately arrived home at about 10 to five. Our daughter's school is 10 by foot so I had more than enough time to go pick her up. I didn't not call on purpose, I was sad and had my head full.

As soon as I arrived home I could sense she my spouse was angry for she stared at me while I walked up the stairs with bags of groceries in hand. She didn't say hello, didn't ask how the appointment went or anything. She just asked so I(her) have to pick up our daughter ? I replied ""just give me 5 minutes to come to"".

All of a suddenI heard the door close as she left without saying anything. 
I made dinner, washed the dishes.

When they got home the first thing she tells me is that I should've called. I told her I got stuck in traffic and she said I was disrespectful and didn't consider her feelings.
When I told her that she did the exact same thing  when she went out with a friend and said she'd call.to say if she would pick up our daughter she got even more pissed off.
Eventually that day she didn't call and I went to pick daughter up and never brought it up to her or anything. 
She ended up not having dinner with daughter and I.

Later at night she, along with daughter came into the kitchen and she asked me who was gonna put daughter to bed that day, as my daughter pointed to her as if saying I want it to be mom, I said ok, 
can be mom today.
Spouse got even more upset and said why me? I put her to bed yesterday. I must note that putting daughter to bed is always a point of contention because my spouse sometimes lacks the patience to put daughter to bed, this was the case since she was a baby so I more often than not put her to bed, which is completely fine by me. The only one that complains sometimes is my daughter herself, she says why does it always have to be you?
Spouse made a fuss about putting her to bed and eventually she came to tell me that I had to put her to bed which I did.

After daughter was asleep spouse and I spoke in the kitchen where I said she was insensitive and that the way she speaks with so much anger in her voice in front of daughter wasn't correct which of course upset her even more.
She is still angry at me today and still hasn't even asked how I'm feeling, how my mom is or how the appointment went.

Am I too sensitive? Maybe my mom's illness and leaving the country make me extra sensitive?
AITA?


",Asshole,2024-05-09,"AITA or too sensitive? So yesterday I (M45) had a busy day running errands with my elderly Mom. She is sick and will be moving out of the country in about 2 weeks. The day before I made sure to speak to my spouse (F45) and asked if I could use the car or if she needed it. Explained to her that I would be helping my mom pack and the I would take her to a doctor's appointment after. 

She said it would be OK and we agreed that I'd call her at around four to let her know if I'd be back in time to pick upmour daughter from school.
SonI spent the day helping pack and then I took my mom to her appointment which ran a bit long and then coming back I got stuck in traffic and ultimately arrived home at about 10 to five. Our daughter's school is 10 by foot so I had more than enough time to go pick her up. I didn't not call on purpose, I was sad and had my head full.

As soon as I arrived home I could sense she my spouse was angry for she stared at me while I walked up the stairs with bags of groceries in hand. She didn't say hello, didn't ask how the appointment went or anything. She just asked so I(her) have to pick up our daughter ? I replied ""just give me 5 minutes to come to"".

All of a suddenI heard the door close as she left without saying anything. 
I made dinner, washed the dishes.

When they got home the first thing she tells me is that I should've called. I told her I got stuck in traffic and she said I was disrespectful and didn't consider her feelings.
When I told her that she did the exact same thing  when she went out with a friend and said she'd call.to say if she would pick up our daughter she got even more pissed off.

Now, I have this family friend (F20), Sarah. Our parents have been friends long before we were born, and I was best friends with her older brother (M25) growing up. Frankly, Sarah and I were never ‚Äúclose‚Äù, but our families were and spent every weekend and holiday together, so despite our differences, I considered her a good friend and sister, up until recently. We were just very different people‚Äîwe had no common interests and just very different personalities. We would still hang out in groups, but it was the type of relationship where we never really talked to each other directly. No bad blood on my end. When I got engaged and began planning my wedding, I asked Sarah to be my bridesmaid. I didn‚Äôt expect anything from her in terms of help, but I thought that she would at least be supportive or happy for me‚Ä¶NOPE!

A month or two into planning go by and I hear that Sarah has been saying things about me such as: 1) It‚Äôs ‚Äúclear‚Äù that my fianc√© doesn‚Äôt want to marry me and that he doesn‚Äôt love me, 2) I ‚Äúdemanded‚Äù that my future in-laws give us money to pay for the wedding, and 3) She hopes my wedding gets ruined. This is really only a fraction of the things said, in addition to ‚Äújokes‚Äù about how she should wear a gown to outshine me, and criticism over ever wedding decision I made. Because I heard these from other people, I decided to just take note and gave her the benefit of the doubt. I asked Sarah out for dinner (my treat) and essentially asked about everything I heard being said. She didn‚Äôt deny any of it and instead said it was true, but that she didn‚Äôt know why she said those things and that something about me just made her hate me. We talked for hours, and afterwards I told her that I think it would be better if I don‚Äôt have her as a bridesmaid and asked for her dress back (which I paid for). She did apologize and give the dress back, but it didn‚Äôt feel sincere.

After her mother (F59) found out, she started blowing up my phone, saying that I was an AH for firing Sarah as bridesmaid, that I was ungrateful, and that she clearly ‚Äúwasted time and money‚Äù on me as a kid. Sarah‚Äôs mother then said she would not attend the wedding unless I made Sarah a bridesmaid again, to which I said no. The following weeks just got much worse, which eventually resulted in us uninviting them from our wedding.

70,1co4yqn,AITA for might not wanting to attend my friends wedding anymore?,"I (F28) have been invited to my friends (F27) wedding. We met about 8 years ago, talk on the phone a lot and meet up a few times a year.

A while ago I received the invitation for her wedding. I already expected the invitation as I knew she was going to get married this year. 
I noticed that the ceremony and the wedding party are at two different venues, but also at two different locations. At first the ceremony will take place in the afternoon, then there will be a four to five hour gap until the wedding party. The first location would be an hour and a half by public transport for me, the second location would be two and a half hours and a walk of half an hour in wedding party clothes and heels. The first location is doable for me to travel to by public transport but the second location is not accessible by public transport.
I waited until we'd meet up again to discuss this with her. 

When we met up she understood my point of view. She told me I could just get a cab to the second location, but I wouldn't be able to afford this with my income as cabs are very expensive in this area (which she knows). She mentioned that dinner is not included. After talking about the wedding for a while she slipped up, when she suggested one of her friends might be able to pick me up for the second location, she said this friend is a 'day guest' so it wouldn't be an option after all. When I asked what that meant she explained that the day guests would have dinner with them. She told me I am not a day guest. Apparently there are multiple friends that are day guests. 
This was also the moment I found out there is a 4 to 5 hour gap between the ceremony and the wedding party (just for the non-day guests). I did not know this beforehand. I asked her what I would be able to do, as I would love to attend the ceremony and the wedding party as well. She didn't seem to be bothered to help me come up with a solution and just changed the subject in our conversation multiple times.
She did suggest I could attend the wedding party instead of the ceremony and the party. When I asked her if there was someone that could possibly drop me off at a station, she said she did not know. I also have no way of communicating with her other friends as I haven't met them.

I do not know what to do. I feel a bit hurt by my friend, but I also understand that this is her wedding day that I should not interfere with her wishes. 
I expected her to include me on the guestlist for dinner due to the distance I have to travel to get to the wedding. I feel like a burden for wanting to attend this wedding.

Yesterday i bought the new starbucks drink (which is basically a lemonade with boba) and was excited to try it for the first time. When i walked into class my best friend side eyed me, did a double take, and then told me the drink was gross.

For context, this friend has consistently been giving me dirty looks in the hallway or ignoring me in class. I recently tried to talk to her as i was walking into the building but as i was walking up she made a face and turned away from me to walk with her boyfriend.

After she said the drink was gross I told her i liked and she responded that it was disgusting. I don‚Äôt have a problem with her sharing her opinion in the drink, but i hate when people call something i am eating/drinking gross. I think it‚Äôs extremely rude especially after the person said they liked it. I was annoyed by her attitude so i quipped back with ‚Äúeat your edamame‚Äù since she recently has been eating edamame in class and made sure to announce it as a joke.

When I met him last July, I had just suspended my studies at university. I  wasn't enjoying the course I was doing so asked the university to hold my space there for next year on a different course. As a result, I didn't get to attend last years ""Summer Ball"", which is a prom-type event where we go to a posh venue and dress formally. I didn't get a prom at the end of high-school, as 2020 covid restrictions were in place; I was really looking forward to getting dressed up fancy and going for drinks and dancing with my friends.

I sent Steven a cute-invite with flowers I'd drawn by hand, inviting him to be my plus one, he accepted. I thought this would be a good opportunity for him to meet my friends, as I'd met his and we got along well, as I had put in effort to get to know them.

 He has a group of friends, just five other boys, and a few of their gfs (including me), were sometimes invited to gatherings (drinks, bowling, house parties etc). This friend group (mainly the guys), don't really have the same values or humour as myself, but I've tried my hardest to get along with them, and I'd say I do a pretty good job of it. I've sometimes made jokes that didn't really land with them and felt a bit awkward (I am autistic and sometimes struggle to read a room), but nothing too weird.

I have been in therapy for over 5 years now trying to unlearn the unhealthy relationship that I have with my mother. It was impacting my relationship with my husband, my friends, even my relationship with my dad (they separated when I was 3). Not only that but my mom has been a raging alcoholic my whole life. So I have had to unlearn all of that and learn to create boundaries. So this is one I‚Äôm trying to draw. 

My mother threw. A. Fit. Saying comments like ‚Äúoh so you don‚Äôt want to spend Mother‚Äôs Day with your mother? Huh‚Äù and ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not spending Mother‚Äôs Day with me then you won‚Äôt be spending Father‚Äôs Day with your dad then ü•≥‚Äù and making comments about how I‚Äôm angry and I need to go to therapy. Totally unwilling to compromise with me on going out another night ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good thanks‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna do what I want‚Äù. 

I feel absolutely defeated. I don‚Äôt think my mom is emotionally mature, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever respect my decisions around my family or my daughter, and if it‚Äôs not her way then I‚Äôm the bad guy. And I can‚Äôt help my internalize that a bit.

So, what do you all think? AITA?",0.0,0.005081577226519585,0,1

We have 3 cats whom are very active & for the life of me, I could not figure out how to make them stop eating EVERYTHING they come across. They‚Äôre well fed but they‚Äôre never satisfied lol 

My bestfriend used to like cats but lately, whenever he comes over, he keeps complaining about how they‚Äôre not well behaved & that they eat food he leaves out & are too active.

78,1co48gn,AITA for my response to my mother inlaw?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years and we just recently had our second baby.
My MIL has been staying with us due to an upcoming surgery.

She has been such an amazing help and I'm forever grateful for her presence.
I'm 4 weeks post postpartum (second c-section delivery). At 3 weeks postpartum, I suffered an infection due to an opening on my incision line so it's been tough managing the pain, infection, sleepless nights with baby, etc.
My MIL had surgery few days ago and has been quite unwell since having surgery. My husband works full time as well so I've had to resume daily household tasks before fully healing and the recommended 6 weeks. 
 
This morning MIL insisted on resting after breakfast so she went to her room. 
Popped my 4 year old for a nap after lunch followed by my newborn. Once they fell asleep, I too had a quick nap. 
Usually she comes out for meals when she's ready  so I left food ready for her but to my surprise when I woke up she hadn't ate. 
We had a chat and she said she wasn't feeling up to it and will eat later.

I quickly started fixing dinner then I went to get her to come eat considering she had skipped lunch but with all attempts, she insisted that she will come out but didn't. 
Please bare in mind I've got a newborn that I haven't fed, a 4 year old that needs to eat, shower before bed and myself too all this while groaning in pain so I couldn't possibly continue to stand at her door pleading for her to join us especially knowing she usually comes to eat when she's ready. 

Fast forward about an hour later my husband comes back from work. Looking upset, he asks about his mum not eating.
I responded by telling him not to start anything and that I've had a long day. 
He then proceeded to say that I didn't get her out to come eat because ""she's not my responsibility"".
This statement got me upset immediately because it's not the first time he says things like that and upsetting knowing deep down I don't have anything against his mother. 
Also, while his mother has been unwell and he's at work, I've been the one to check in regularly to make sure she's taking her meds, make her a cup of tea, serve her food and do whatever is needed despite being unwell myself and recovering from surgery too. 

Now here is where I may be the asshole, his mother apologised for not honouring my request to come join us at the table.
I responded to her that I'm fine and don't have a problem with that but what he said to me is what hurt me. I added that he shouldn't say things like that and should be more kind with his words. 
He then got angry, called me disrespectful and threw F bombs right there with our 4 year old present.
He continuously called me disrespectful for speaking that way in front of his mum and while they were eating which I understand but in my defence, i was responding to her and i felt the need to do so by expressing exactly how I feel.

84,1co3kky,AITA for making no effort during my sister's birthday party and ruining her day?,"My younger sister Meg (12f) just turned 12. I (16f) was at her birthday party because she wanted me there and whatever Meg wants, she gets. So I didn't want to be there and honestly my relationship with my family is strained. Meg is my parents favorite. She's the golden child. They really forget about me generally and it's been that way for a while. So I wasn't happy to be there and I just sat down and ate a little and tried to stay out of the way. Meg tried to get me to play with her because she was annoyed with her ""friends"" and didn't want to speak to them anymore. I said no and Meg got upset. My parents came over and scolded me and tried to force me to play with Meg but I just went outside to sit down. Meg was so disappointed and my parents were furious at me.

I know people will ask for background so; I don't remember Meg being born. So I'm not sure how my parents were before Meg. But I know I have always always felt Meg comes first. Our parents go out of their way to love on her. Always. They read Meg bedtime stories every night until a few months ago. I don't remember them reading to me and I know it didn't happen after Meg was born. They never helped me with homework but they would bend over backward to help Meg. She got tutoring when she struggled while they'd get annoyed with me and say I needed to make more of an effort in that class. I would also get glared at. They forgot my birthday a few times, never forgot hers. They also forgot my favorite food on several occasions and would instead give someone Meg's. But they never forget Meg's. My parents would send me to a babysitter if I was sick but one of them stayed home with Meg. They take her out of school for a day sometimes to have a ""fun day"" and they never do that for me.

I also know my parents skipped meetings with my teachers and school because there have always been concerns with my math skills. They never show up to these and they don't really go to the parent conferences for me either. So I struggle with math always.

With Meg, she will sometimes look to me like I'm her favorite person but when I try to explain I don't like something she will throw a tantrum. Otherwise she wants me around but doesn't ever want to think of me and I know she's young and that's not that weird. But it's hard to feel any kind of love or happiness for someone when they get love but not you and then when they show you love, they also show it in a more selfish way where you're supposed to do what they want.

Extended family spoke up in the past. But when my parents told them to stop they did. I tried talking to my parents and they didn't listen to me. Like I would be pouring my heart out while they did other things. I broke down in front of them one night and they ignored me. So I know they don't care.

And now they're SO SO pissed that I ruined Meg's birthday and they say it's all my fault.

I (16f) was at her birthday party because she wanted me there and whatever Meg wants, she gets. So I didn't want to be there and honestly my relationship with my family is strained. Meg is my parents favorite. She's the golden child. They really forget about me generally and it's been that way for a while. So I wasn't happy to be there and I just sat down and ate a little and tried to stay out of the way. Meg tried to get me to play with her because she was annoyed with her ""friends"" and didn't want to speak to them anymore. I said no and Meg got upset. My parents came over and scolded me and tried to force me to play with Meg but I just went outside to sit down. Meg was so disappointed and my parents were furious at me.

I know people will ask for background so; I don't remember Meg being born. So I'm not sure how my parents were before Meg. But I know I have always always felt Meg comes first. Our parents go out of their way to love on her. Always. They read Meg bedtime stories every night until a few months ago. I don't remember them reading to me and I know it didn't happen after Meg was born. They never helped me with homework but they would bend over backward to help Meg. She got tutoring when she struggled while they'd get annoyed with me and say I needed to make more of an effort in that class. I would also get glared at. They forgot my birthday a few times, never forgot hers. They also forgot my favorite food on several occasions and would instead give someone Meg's. But they never forget Meg's. My parents would send me to a babysitter if I was sick but one of them stayed home with Meg. They take her out of school for a day sometimes to have a ""fun day"" and they never do that for me.

I also know my parents skipped meetings with my teachers and school because there have always been concerns with my math skills. They never show up to these and they don't really go to the parent conferences for me either. So I struggle with math always.

With Meg, she will sometimes look to me like I'm her favorite person but when I try to explain I don't like something she will throw a tantrum. Otherwise she wants me around but doesn't ever want to think of me and I know she's young and that's not that weird. But it's hard to feel any kind of love or happiness for someone when they get love but not you and then when they show you love, they also show it in a more selfish way where you're supposed to do what they want.

Extended family spoke up in the past. But when my parents told them to stop they did. I tried talking to my parents and they didn't listen to me. Like I would be pouring my heart out while they did other things. I broke down in front of them one night and they ignored me. So I know they don't care.

And now they're SO SO pissed that I ruined Meg's birthday and they say it's all my fault. AITA?",0.0,0.04407261312007904,0,1
85,1co3imb,WIBTA if I yelled at my husband's brother for leaving my animals alone?,"My husband and I have many animals. 2 cats, a dog, 2 snakes, and a fish. All of which need to be fed and taken care of (for obvious reasons) 
They are our whole lives, and we absolutely adore them. 

A few months ago we decided to start planning for my husband's birthday, we were going to go on a week long road trip and celebrate in various states because there were a few my husband had never been to and wanted to visit. During the time we would be gone, we needed to find someone we trusted to care for our fur babies. 

His brother (We'll call him Jake) offered to help, and we offered thanks and compensation for his troubles. 
His brother and I have never truly gotten along because he is fairly rude, dismissive, and I've seen some things in his attitude and mannerism that makes me extremely uncomfortable, however he is usually really good with our animals, specifically our dog (He can be very anxious) 

Our cats are pretty chill and just like sleeping and avoiding people so we weren't worried about them the same as long as they got food, water, and some playtime with a laser pointer or one of their toys.

Anyways, our dog has always been ok around Jake so we weren't completely worried. Jake agreed to watch him and everything was set.

My husband's other brother (Let's call him blake) calls us and asks us where the cat food was and apologized for only just getting to the house to feed them. We were confused as Jake had agreed to be there to feed, and let us know what was going on with our animals. Blake explains that Jake had decided last minute to help a friend out and leave for out of state a day or 2 prior and hadn't told anyone until he was already gone.

He didn't tell us he was leaving. He just left our animals alone without telling ANYONE. Our dog went a whole day and a half without walking, outside time, food, or ANYTHING. 

Blake is a lovely person who I would have wanted to watch our animals in the first place, however he is a very busy man taking care of 3 kids, working full time, and his wife is currently unable tow all due to medical reasons, so his time is very precious. I both feel bad for him because Jake just pushed it off onto him, and for our animals because they didn't deserve to be left without food, water and bathroom availability

Our trash company picks up our trash early in the morning on Wednesdays so we bring out the trash in the afternoon prior. Our driveway is a quarter mile long as we live in the country.)

   I was woken up early yesterday morning by my mom. She said I had to take a broken trashcan to the curb and that she told me to do it yesterday. I apologized saying that I either didn‚Äôt hear her say that or forgot but it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue as I can do it now. After getting out of bed and getting dressed, I looked outside to see it was pretty dark and cloudy. I quickly checked my weather radar, which showed a supercell thunderstorm (a type of thunderstorm that is strong and produces tornadoes) was going to run over our location in 15 minutes. The radar also showed that it had some notable hail. I got ready as quick as possible. Considering I had just woken up it was a pretty hasty preparation. Even though I got ready fast, the hail was only a few minutes out. I told my mother this saying that we should wait. She said that I needed to do it now because I didn‚Äôt do it yesterday and that they would be here soon.

The hail will be at least marble sized and that even without the hail, the very strong winds and lightning is still enough to stay inside. She walked to her room to grab boots. I follow her, telling her that she really shouldn‚Äôt do it and that it‚Äôs not worth risking her safety. We can call them next week about picking up the broken trashcan. She quickly left afterward. While I was making breakfast for my sisters, the storm came and the hail was at least ping-pong ball sized with lots of lightning and wind. It lasted for about 10 minutes.

89,1co1d2z,AITA for asking my neighbour to have her kids stop spraying water guns over my fence?,"I'm using a throwaway account for this post. Me (23F) and my boyfriend (25M) moved into our new home last November. Our neighbours are a single mum ""Sarah"" (35F) and her two boys (7M and 12M), and when we first moved in Sarah was very sweet and welcoming. Her sons would say hi to us sometimes as well.

As we're in England, you can probably guess we don't get a great deal of sunny weather. Recently though it's gotten better and we've had a few hot days. A couple of weekends back, my boyfriend and I were enjoying a particularly sunny day sitting in our garden. We could hear Sarah's kids playing in their garden next door but didn't mind, until a jet of water came over the fence and hit me. It took me by surprise and within a few seconds, two jets were being shot over the fence and spraying into our garden. I went upstairs to look at what the boys were doing. I saw they both had huge waterguns, and were still aiming them over the fence and shooting water all over our garden furniture and plants. I came downstairs to see my boyfriend calling over the fence, saying the boys' names and asking them to please stop spraying water. The boys went quiet and went away, but no more than two minutes later were doing it again.

We were both frustrated, and I went next door and rang the bell. Sarah answered and I told her what her kids had been doing and asked if she'd make them stop. I thought she'd be understanding, but she seemed really offended and told me I was overreacting to kids being kids. I tried to explain myself further but she told me that while she'd tell them to stop, she wouldn't ""police her children playing"" and said it was ""only water"" and wouldn't do any damage. Honestly I don't do well with confrontations, and her response was so different from what I'd expected I kind of froze. I could see her kids over her shoulder watching from the hall, still holding their waterguns. Sarah closed the door on me and I just went home. Her boys kept playing outside but they didn't spray water over the wall again. 

The next day I saw Sarah and said hi but she ignored me. I felt a bit awkward and let it be, until later she sent me a long text telling me she'd ignored me because she was upset by what I'd done the previous day. She said she felt I'd been a ""Karen"" by stopping her kids playing, and making her out to be a bad mother. I was so confused by that because I'd never done those things, I had just wanted them to stop spraying water in our garden. I don't care what they do in theirs, and honestly being called a ""Karen"" was hurtful and makes me think she missed the point of why I even said anything and is being vindictive. 

I've spoken to other people about it and some have actually sided with Sarah, saying the kids probably meant no harm and I likely embarrassed Sarah. I was sure in my stance before, but now I'm beginning to doubt myself and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.

We have Sam over maybe twice a month, my kids adore him and he treats them like his own.  We don't see Mike much, he is very busy with his work and own family.  I'm sad but get it.
Recently, Sam asked why we weren't going on holiday.  I think he knew that it was because we can't afford it.  I'm not hard up and my kids eat well and we go on treat days but can't afford more than that.  Sam immediately offered me ¬£15k as a gift to pay for a family holiday.  He says he can afford it and otherwise it'd just be sitting in the bank.  I said yes please and Sam has sent me the money.  I booked a really cool climbing holiday with the kids and they are super excited - Sam is coming for some of it. My husband is working while we are away which means he can earn a bit of overtime and then take the kids somewhere when we are home and I can earn some extra overtime to help pay for that.  My mum got really distressed that we were overspending and so I agreed with Sam that I'd tell her how we were paying for the trip.. anyway mum must have told Mike.

Mike rang me last night and is really angry and thinks I'm taking advantage of Sam.  He says I'm manipulating Sam into covering my family's budget and that it was my choice to have three kids and also to work for the NHS when I could earn more doing the same job somewhere else.  He also feels that Sam is favouring my kids and that his child will be super hurt that Sam is paying for a holiday for my kids.  I tried to explain that his child is welcome to come but he said I know she hates climbing (which is true) and that Sam was trying to give my kids access to some of the opportunities we had growing up.  Mike earns more than any of us and takes 5* holidays every year so I don't think its a money thing.  I think he genuinely feels I'm taking advantage of Sam and guilt tripping him into helping us out.  In fairness to Mike, I do talk about money in front of Sam but not to get him to give his to me but because I value his advice.

93,1co0fli,AITA for refusing to make my niece a doll like her sister's?,"I (26, F) have no kids. But my oldest brother has two daughters. Oldest is now 7, younger just turned 5. I love both of them a lot, but I'm not blind. As someone who grew up with siblings, it's very clear that oldest daughter (ON) is golden child. She gets whatever she wants, no matter how expensive, and is always showered with praise for her pageants and singing. My younger niece (YN) is very shy, but she is still very sweet and enjoys things like reading and animals. Recently, my YN has been feeling bad about herself. I asked why, and she told me it was because she didn't like her hair color. She's got auburn curls. She was sad because everyone always said how pretty ON's hair was, which was a very light blonde and straight. It got so bad that she'd apparently tried to cut it off, which her mom had just laughed off as childhood mishap. 

When I was over at brother's house, I noticed that the two were playing with dolls. ON had a very nice Barbie doll, while YN had what looked like a short, cheap Walmart knockoff. I asked why, and mom said it was because she couldn't find a doll with red hair. This made me upset, because 1. The doll's hair is bright red, which is not her hair color, and 2. It was extremely different quality. I said nothing, but when it was YN birthday, I acted. For months I researched doll making and restoring. I took a Barbie, and replaced her hair with some that matched hers and painted the eyes. I then hand sewed several custom outfits, and gave each a blue whale theme (her favorite animal). As a cosplayer, this wasn't that hard. 

On her birthday, YN was ecstatic. But her sister was obviously not. I didn't pay attention to her, instead focusing on making sure YN liked her gifts. But only a few days later, her parents called me, telling me that I needed to make ON a doll as well. I said I'd get her one on her next birthday.

I was outside bathing when my sister comes outside with her child/my niece (2 year old). She sets a bath of water and then leaves my niece there with the water to bathe herself. She was there just playing in the water and splashing it on herself.
I don't usually say anything to her as they are not my children and can't tell her how to parent her children. I mind my own business usually and try not to start an argument. Thing is she left the child outside with me and I'm of the opinion that her mother should be there actively bathing her but instead she usually leaves them to bathe themselves while she goes and lay in bed.

When my sister came back after some time I let a comment slip asking if she shouldn't have been the one out here bathing her child and what if something had happened. She said ""well her aunty is out here to watch her"". 
I let slip that ""I never asked to be an aunt"". She paused for a bit before trying to explain to me how if it was my child she would do the same thing for me but I reminded her that I'm never having children anyway so that doesn't apply to me and she said okay.

Later in the evening I heard her muttering to herself about what I said to her, she was obviously upset and irate at me. She even went as far as to keep her children away from me and my room.
It's a usually thing for her children to bang on my room door to purposely annoy me among other trouble making and she usually doesn't do or say anything about it. But any time we butt heads in regards to her once again trying to force responsibility of her kids on me and I push back, she goes out of her way to keep them away from me and its ironic how I wish she would have stepped in and kept them away from me all the other times they were causing trouble. She's not spiting me by keeping her spoilt kids away from me. I wish it had continued but she usually stops being irate right when she needs something from me.

Even so what I had said was the truth and I'm not sorry for saying it. I never asked to be an aunt and it seemed like she just kept trying to force the responsibility of caring for her children on me in various other instances throughout the years. So I felt like it was necessary for her to finally hear this and get it through her head that I don't want the responsibility of caring for her children, I am not obligated nor do I have the capacity for it as previous instances have shown.

Y has a bad reputation in class for being extremely stubborn, self-centered and abrasive, with a classmate stating that he forced himself into different friend groups in their former schools (they were in the same school prior to joining this current one). X also knows Y from their former school, and thinks that Y is too cocky and has a bad personality. 

Going to my current predicament, Y sort of forced himself into my friendship with X, creating this ""friend group"". X makes his distaste of Y quite obvious (in my opinion at least) by finding any excuse to get away from Y (i.e making me sit between both of them during assemblies and lessons to act as a barrier) and not talking to him as much as he does to me.

In my opinion, I don't think Y is too bad of a person. He's abrasive and stubborn, but I have a higher tolerance than most people for that, and I don't think he neccesarily has bad intentions, just bad execution. Another thing is I feel bad if I completely ignore him as well because I was also a loner in school and I don't want others to go through the same thing. However, the way Y keeps sticking to me and X can be annoying at times and I don't want X to be too guarded all the time (to clarify again, X doesn't like Y).

So, my decision as of a few weeks back and continuing is to sit on the fence, replying to Y if he starts a conversation but not starting one with him. However, i still feel like an asshole for not just telling him the way I feel about him.

98,1co04ts,AITA for not wanting my housemate to be friend with or mix with my new housemates I will be living with next year ?,"Some background: i live in a house of 3 where one I met at Uni (let‚Äôs call them Josh) and the other one I went to secondary school with (let‚Äôs call them Gina) so have known for 10 years plus. 

Me and Josh met because we got put together in the same flat in first year at university. Living with him has been absolutely fine, we were the only survivors to make it out of the first year flat, still willing to live together. 

Gina moved in with us in 2nd year as she didn‚Äôt get on with her flatmates from her first year flat. I was so excited to live with her as she was my best friend since the beginning of secondary school. Even though we didn‚Äôt live together in first year, she was always round and became really good mates with my mates. It seemed only natural for us all to live together the next year. 

Since moving in together, I have found it incredibly difficult to live with her. I have to lock my door every time I leave my room as she takes and uses my makeup and straighteners, only finding out when she messages afterwards saying thanks and that she‚Äôd returned them. 

This was only the beginning of the problems to arise throughout our year living together.
The list includes: 

* using my shower stuff (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel etc) without asking 
* using my plates, bowls, knives and forks, air fryer, oven tray and not washing them up after.
* even pinching a pair of my underwear where I only knew because I saw them dirty on our bathroom floor (I can‚Äôt 100% prove that they‚Äôre mine however I can‚Äôt find the pair that they are in my room plus, she would not buy the size that they were) 
* constant stuff has gone missing such as a hand towel that I left thinking was going to be safe on the bathroom towel rail only to come back after a weekend at home and it disappear completely. I know it is not Josh but I have to put it to the whole group chat in order to not be accusing her directly but she denied taking/using it. 
* she‚Äôs squirted ketchup on the bonnet of my car only saying that it wasn‚Äôt her fault because the friend was with egged her on to do it. 

Some more info, we have an ‚Äòadopted‚Äô housemate that spends a lot of time with us‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call them Matt. Over time, I do feel like I have been replaced by Matt however because of all of the above and the very apparent lack of boundaries from Gina, this is something I am not mad about and I can‚Äôt wait to move out of the house. 

Me and Josh found out new housemates through a mutual friend and we have been doing a lot of things with them. I have been really enjoying spending time with them and can not wait to properly live with them. 

Josh announced a few days ago that he is going to invite Gina to the next meet up we have with our new housemates. This willl be the first time Gina has met them as I have been making a conscience effort to keep them separate. 

They both know about each other and I‚Äôve said that they will get to meet Gina next year most likely but at the moment, I‚Äôd quite like to keep them separate. 

This is because I feel like last year, I bent over backwards in order to make sure Gina was mates and felt included with all my new flatmates and friends. Come this year and she‚Äôs got a new job at a pub and makes no time for me and Josh. Even to the extent of she went to a pub quiz last week with some girls I was friends with in school and I didn‚Äôt even know it was happening until I saw the posts on social media afterwards with them all in the pictures together. 

Me keeping the new housemates and Gina separate is not a revenge/petty decision but rather me trying to be more independent from her and also maybe even start to distance myself after the lack of respect from her whilst living together. 

I have tired to explain this to Josh but because Josh has nothing Gina uses/wants, he doesn‚Äôt understand what my issue is and why I want to keep them separate for now. 

Am I being an arsehole or am I actually justified in my thinking?? 

Thanks :) ",TL;DR,2024-05-09,"AITA for not wanting my housemate to be friend with or mix with my new housemates I will be living with next year ? Some background: i live in a house of 3 where one I met at Uni (let‚Äôs call them Josh) and the other one I went to secondary school with (let‚Äôs call them Gina) so have known for 10 years plus. 

Me and Josh met because we got put together in the same flat in first year at university. Living with him has been absolutely fine, we were the only survivors to make it out of the first year flat, still willing to live together. 

Gina moved in with us in 2nd year as she didn‚Äôt get on with her flatmates from her first year flat. I was so excited to live with her as she was my best friend since the beginning of secondary school. Even though we didn‚Äôt live together in first year, she was always round and became really good mates with my mates. It seemed only natural for us all to live together the next year. 

Since moving in together, I have found it incredibly difficult to live with her. I have to lock my door every time I leave my room as she takes and uses my makeup and straighteners, only finding out when she messages afterwards saying thanks and that she‚Äôd returned them. 

This was only the beginning of the problems to arise throughout our year living together.
The list includes: 

* using my shower stuff (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel etc) without asking 
* using my plates, bowls, knives and forks, air fryer, oven tray and not washing them up after.
* even pinching a pair of my underwear where I only knew because I saw them dirty on our bathroom floor (I can‚Äôt 100% prove that they‚Äôre mine however I can‚Äôt find the pair that they are in my room plus, she would not buy the size that they were) 
* constant stuff has gone missing such as a hand towel that I left thinking was going to be safe on the bathroom towel rail only to come back after a weekend at home and it disappear completely. I know it is not Josh but I have to put it to the whole group chat in order to not be accusing her directly but she denied taking/using it. 
* she‚Äôs squirted ketchup on the bonnet of my car only saying that it wasn‚Äôt her fault because the friend was with egged her on to do it.

99,1co02r6,WIBTA for taking my son to his friend's funeral even though his father is against it?,"I 26F co-parent my son James 5M with my ex Eli 26M. I am a single parent, and have a bad relationship with Eli after he ghosted me when I was 7 months pregnant despite saying he was going to be involved in James' life. I really struggled when James was younger and had to drop out of college and go back to finish my degree after Eli left.

Eli reached out late last year to make amends and wanted to be present in James' life. I refused and told him he can ask for custody through the courts as I wouldn't let him see James in case he left again. 

Since then we have maintained a custody agreement where James stays with Eli on alternate weekends and he backpaid and currently pays child support. Outside of picking and dropping James, I don't talk to Eli. I have a civil relationship with him infront of James and don't badmouth him in front of my son. 

James' friend at school Sean 5M has passed from cancer and James is devastated. Sean's family have invited me, James and Eli to the funeral and James is aware of the funeral as his classmates have spoken about it. 

I want James to attend for closure and think its important for him to attend, but Eli thinks James is too young and some of his other classmates aren't attending. Sean and James were close though and Sean's mom is a good friend of mine, so I wanted to show my support. The funeral falls on a weekday, during my time with James, and as Eli's only reason is he is too young, I want to take him. Eli has only recently become involved and was not around to see James and Sean together enough for him to see their relationship. Our co parenting relationship is awful though and taking James to the funeral would make it way worse.

101,1cnzyf5,WIBTA for not contributing to the epxtension of our (3 siblings + me) mother's grave which is due to run out?,"Edit: In Germany you have to pay for a grave and it will last for a certain amount of years. You need to pay after that to extend the grave, otherwise it will be removed from the graveyard property.

Hello,

one of my sisters and my brother have met up and arranged to pay for an extension of our mother's grave. They have asked to share the cost of 600‚Ç¨ between all of us, so 150‚Ç¨/person ($161).

I am neither religious nor do I share any other relation or emotional connection to the concept of graves. I didn't care about them. I loved my mother but the important part to me are my memories of her, not her grave. As a result I haven't visited her grave once in all 17 years since her death.

The grave is important to my brother. He's mostly done the upkeep. My sisters somewhat care about it. The relationship between me and my brother is bad, we haven't talked for years. It's good between me and my sisters.

I have only recently finished my university degree and started work, moved into my own apartment and frankly speaking, furniture and kitchen appliances which are all necessary have been quite expensive. Spending 150‚Ç¨ is a lot to spend on something completely irrelevant to me when I still lack furniture (like a couch and different stuff).

They don't have another room for them to stay in. My sibling said they could stay in my spare room, I passed it off as a joke but my sibling kept saying it so I firmly declined, said no. I apologised for my snappy tone later & they were fine. My grandparents have a blow up bed for them. I have a 2 bed house, the spare room is basically for my cats as we have a cat litter unit, cat tower etc though theres a spare bed in the room. Complete honesty, the bed isn't great. It was a hand me down from another family member which isn't in good condition, the cats have slept in it multiple times and the room is just, a cats room!

Also, quite frankly I don't want them staying.

We work FT so only have weekends to do this & it takes time. There's nowhere to sit/relax as everything is everywhere, tools laying around, packs of flooring etc. My cats are scared & don't do well w/ new people.

He fully supports them and their mental health, while telling me that I don't have ""real"" mental illness (despite being diagnosed) and that I don't need to be on the medication prescribed to me. 

I have voiced multiple times that I feel that the expectations for me versus them are  completely different. He's more lenient with them and consistently asks me to change myself as to not overwhelm them. Meanwhile, I'm expected to never be overwhelmed and to push through every single thing that's thrown at me and if I'm unable to, then I'm somehow weak and unfit for the ""real world"", which has been his attitude towards me since childhood. An example of how we're treated differently being that he wanted me and my sister to help out with something, but we both wanted to go out with friends. I offered to wait until after I was done helping to leave while my sister left immediately. I was the only one told that I was being selfish, despite the fact that I was still intending to help.

I've tried to express how I feel like I'm not accepted, due to constantly needing to change myself for them, and how I feel that my needs are largely ignored and treated as less serious than my siblings'. I have voiced these feelings multiple times over multiple months.

108,1cnxl94,AITA for Expressing Expectations for SAHM,"A little background... My (36m) GF (35F) and i live together and have a 25 month old son. I work a salaried position making *just* enough to cover the cost of living and caring for the child. It's mostly only a 45-hour week, so I usually have plenty of time to help at home.
Things I maintain 'ownership' of in the house;
- Income/bills
- Family alarm clock (I get up early for work and gently wake her + help get kiddo up)
- Cleaning
- Laundry 
- Errands (grocery shopping, pharmacy, dr appts etc)
- Meals are 50/50ish on who prepares. I do fresh, she does pre-packaged frozen
- Planning for any activity we will do outside the house 

I feel like I do as much as I can to be a good dad and partner. I am growing fairly resentful of our situation. She kind of strong-armed her way to be a SAHM without my agreement to that and is now either lost in the SAH thing or being manipulative to maintain it.
I want her to go back to work, at least part time, for a multitude of reasons including financial and physical/mental health. After all, it won't do the child any good for his mother to be SAH if we are broke and she leaves herself to deteriorate health-wise.
My expectations feel pretty normal to me, but i am obviously biased. I want her to go back to work but if she absolutely will not, is it fair to expect her to:
- Wake in the morning without my assistance, and before the child?
- Stay awake and present with the child while I am at work (except for at naptime when she takes a 2hr nap each day)?
- Maintain *some* level of cleanliness in the house during the day?
- Prepare fresh food for her and the child while I am at work? 
- Allow 1 day a week for me to catch a nap or sleep in?
- Watch after her health?
- Be willing to discuss the execution of responsibilities openly?

This just boiled over for me. I took a business trip for 2 days and came home to find the fresh produce and meat I bought beforehand untouched so the kid had been eating junk, the house a mess, and I got mildly ill so I took the day off. She told me i could sleep in, then proceeded to sleep on the sofa. When I got out of bed I find an unattended 2yo and several of the babyproof items (think gates & cabinet locks) unsecured. I expressed that this was NOT OK calmly and evenly, to which she responded 'Oh, just stop,' and went back to bed.  

TL;DR: My SAHM GF sleeps while in charge of caring for our child while I work, feeds our child only pre-packaged foods, and sleeps 10+ hours daily. If I take a PTO day to rest, she expects that I am the sole parental unit and sleeps even more instead of letting me rest and using the Dad/Jr bonding time to catch up on things.

Long story short, my sister is getting married early next year and has just sent out her wedding RSVP's. She's invited everyone but our mother. They haven't talked in years and my sister has gone totally no contact. The reason why is so petty. Our mother has always been loving and caring, a single mom who worked her ass off to care for all of us, and spoiled my sister as she's the youngest. The reason they don't speak is because years ago on a family vacation, my mother's (now ex) partner became abusive towards her while drunk and it turned into a family fight. My mom was so embarrassed and she left the next day. That's the reason, my sister has always been dramatic and took it personally when it's nothing to do with her. My mom has tried for years to talk to her but my sister remains stubborn.
Here's the issue, I'm legally a celebrant and have offered to do this for my sister and her husband to be, free of charge. I found out they've invited people they barely know. Like a cousin of ours who we've only met once and hasn't been in our lives at all. Even her fiance wants her to invite our mother. She's told me she knows it will hurt our mom but she doesn't care.

112,1cnwm35,AITA for doing a videocall? ,"I (27F) have 7 coworkers I'm friends with, including Anna (28F), Mary (30F) and Josh (24M). We have lunch together on workdays, hang out outside of work hours, go on trips together, etc. 

One year ago, Anna moved to company location in a different continent and timezone (6h difference). We have been keeping in touch by WhatsApp. 

6 months later, Mary moved to a neighboring country (same timezone as us). And last month, Josh started working remotely. 

Josh was talking about how lunchtimes feel lonely now, so we decided to make a videocall some day during lunch break. When we told Mary about it, she said she'd like to join too, and suggested dates that would work for her.

We agreed on a date, and then thought to ask Anna too. We knew the timing (7am for her, 1pm for us) would likely be inconvenient for her. But she could join if she wanted (flexible work hours), so we wanted to invite her anyway. 

When we asked her about it, we acknowledged it might not be convenient for her, and told her that we should make plans for a weekend videocall with her.

She refused to join this time, and is now saying that we excluded her and it was inconsiderate of us to choose a time that was not good for her. 

On one hand, I understand her, and I regret that it turned out this way - we didn't mean to single her out. On the other, we did invite her. Plus the idea arose in conversation as a casual thing, whereas making plans with her requires more planning to fit everyone's schedule. Also, Anna never suggested doing a videocall; if she had, we would've gladly joined. 

But when we tried to explain this, and reiterated our suggestion of a longer videocall in a time she could join, she said that it was wrong to try to normalize what we did, and we were being dismissive of her feelings.

So, are we the assholes for doing a video and not including her?

113,1cnwjcj,AITA for getting upset over how my friend asked me to sweep the floor.,"I (33F) moved in with my best friend (32F) last year. I stayed with her before when I was in-between places. She was very rude about my hair being on the floor instead of just asking me to sweep it up (My hair falls out a lot, and it is dark on white tiles). She said she only said the things she did because she is stressed about her boyfriend (They were having trouble at the time).  
I told her before I moved in that I can't help my hair and she said it won't be a problem. When I moved in we made an agreement that she would do the dishes once a week (We have a dishwasher) and that I should sweep once a week (I sweep the kitchen floors when I cook). A few months in and she gets upset about my hair although I was adhering to out agreement. I told her sometimes I'd sweep and the next day I'd see some of my hair again. She said if I see my hair I should sweep. She also gave me flack for dishes piling up. I have been doing my dishes since then.  
When she cooks she makes easy meals, but there are frequently crumbs around the toaster. I love to cook so my dishes are usually more. I usually make sure I clean up after I've cooked. I sometimes make enough food and share with her. A while ago I made us Ramen because she wanted to go out but I couldn't afford it as it is cheaper to make it at home. She didn't offer to help clean then or any other occasion I cooked for us.  
She has a cat and when I sweep my hair there's always a ton of cat hair clumped in with mine. The cat's hair is fine and not as visible as mine on the floors. I have never seen her sweep.  
Anyway I recently got dumped by my toxic ex and haven't been coping well. She was in the hospital for low iron until Tuesday. Monday night I made a sandwich and lettuce fell on the floor. I haven't been in the kitchen since then so I didn't realise it was there. This morning I was in the Kitchen, and she says ""The floor is disgusting."". This upset me because instead of asking me to do something she tried to prompt me with an observation.

Please Reddit, tell me AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-09,"AITA for getting upset over how my friend asked me to sweep the floor. I (33F) moved in with my best friend (32F) last year. I stayed with her before when I was in-between places. She was very rude about my hair being on the floor instead of just asking me to sweep it up (My hair falls out a lot, and it is dark on white tiles). She said she only said the things she did because she is stressed about her boyfriend (They were having trouble at the time).  
I told her before I moved in that I can't help my hair and she said it won't be a problem. When I moved in we made an agreement that she would do the dishes once a week (We have a dishwasher) and that I should sweep once a week (I sweep the kitchen floors when I cook). A few months in and she gets upset about my hair although I was adhering to out agreement. I told her sometimes I'd sweep and the next day I'd see some of my hair again. She said if I see my hair I should sweep. She also gave me flack for dishes piling up. I have been doing my dishes since then.  
When she cooks she makes easy meals, but there are frequently crumbs around the toaster. I love to cook so my dishes are usually more. I usually make sure I clean up after I've cooked. I sometimes make enough food and share with her. A while ago I made us Ramen because she wanted to go out but I couldn't afford it as it is cheaper to make it at home. She didn't offer to help clean then or any other occasion I cooked for us.  
She has a cat and when I sweep my hair there's always a ton of cat hair clumped in with mine. The cat's hair is fine and not as visible as mine on the floors. I have never seen her sweep.  
Anyway I recently got dumped by my toxic ex and haven't been coping well. She was in the hospital for low iron until Tuesday. Monday night I made a sandwich and lettuce fell on the floor. I haven't been in the kitchen since then so I didn't realise it was there. This morning I was in the Kitchen, and she says ""The floor is disgusting."". This upset me because instead of asking me to do something she tried to prompt me with an observation. I told her that she knows that I have not been doing well I and I don't think I deserve her talking to me like that when I have been doing all of these things and she said that she never should have made that agreement since 80% of the dishes and dirt on the floor is mine.

114,1cnwhzi,WIBTA if I told my MIL to stop talking about my pregnancy,"I (F23) found out beginning of March that I am pregnant.

Partner (M25) and I are not ready or financially stable enough to keep the baby and we are leaning in the direction of adoption (I had a very traumatic miscarriage when i was younger and that is why I have decided not to abort)

I come from an extremely religious family and so my parents were really disappointed when i told them I'm pregnant (not married yet) but overall they have agreed to respect whatever decision my partner and I decide to make.   
His mom on the other hand... I love his mom, dad and sister so much, they immediately made me feel like I was a part of their family and have been so loving and kind, I call his parents Mom and Dad and i've grown quite close to his mom hence why i call her my MIL. 

When we told her about the pregnancy we told her that we are going to give baby up for adoption (and put emphasis on this). We also asked her not to tell anyone about the pregnancy until we had had a chance to phone and tell his dad who was not there at the time.  
She immediately ignored both of these things and without warning us phoned his grandmother, put her on speaker and then said that we had an exciting announcement to make, forcing my boyfriend and I to tell the grandmother that I'm pregnant. Then MIL and grandmother started excitedly talking about how they've been waiting so long for a grandchild and this was such a blessing.   
Boyfriend and I were pretty annoyed with this but chose to say nothing.  
MIL suggested we wait for mothers day when we are going to her place for lunch and then we could tell his dad in person, we were happy with this plan and trusted that she would keep quiet until Sunday. We were wrong...

We received a message from his dad that MIL had told him we NEEDED to speak to him on Sunday, so now his dad was stressing thinking there was something seriously wrong.   
We decided to phone him instead of waiting because he was stressing and so telling him in person was ruined by her.

She has also been sending me several messages about how excited she is to finally be a grandmother and she's so excited for the baby to arrive, pressuring me to keep the baby. She's acting like we are keeping the baby and brushing aside the adoption, she's making me feel very uncomfortable and upset because this was already a hard enough decision to make.   
I have always wanted to be a mom and now I can't and it hurts like hell. 

Would I be the asshole if I told her to stop talking about being a grandmother and pressuring me to keep the baby

and to answer some questions before you judge:

1. She cannot financially support us in order to let us keep the baby, she's barely surviving financially herself so that's not an option  
2. I am receiving no financial support from my family either   
3. I unfortunately had to quit my job due to health reasons and so now while i look for better work my boyfriend is covering everything and we're barely managing to pay for groceries.

I did this primarily because she's blindly in love  with him and he's just a dumb teen boy.

He still has one year left of his degree. The company I am gonna work for has offices in multiple cities, including StudyCity, and I can decide where I want to work. Most of my friends and classmates are moving to WorkCity, where the company also has an office, and I want to move there with them. My bf is moving to WorkCity after he graduates next year.

But I am afraid I will get bored in StudyCity when most of my friends are leaving, and I am afraid I will blame my bf for holding me back. And since the company has an office in StudyCity, I can visit him often and stay for more than just a weekend at a time.
My bf thinks one year is a long time for a long distance relationship, and does not want me to move, especially considering I have the opportunity to stay.

120,1cnuw7c,AITA for inviting two of my friends to my graduation lunch? ,"AITA for inviting 2 friends to a reservation lunch for my graduation celebration? Hi Reddit, I am new here so I don't really know how to write a story question. But I am in a situation where my stepmom is upset with me yet again. So I graduate very very soon and about a few days ago I made reservations to a more expensive but not unjustified expense restaurant for 12 people because I have about that many people coming to my graduation. Two of which have canceled coming to the graduation and the dinner because they can no longer make it. So we are back down to 10 people coming to dinner in total. My stepmom has made the reservations for me and she asked me how many people. I told her 12 because of the count that I had in my head. I was out with my friends practicing for a game that we have every single week except this week because we have a bye week. I was playing with four of my friends and two that were already invited but could no longer make it weeks prior to making the reservation in general so they were not included. The other two I was planning on just going out to bars with. My one friend told me she was going out with another graduate who she has been friends with since childhood, so I understood. I mentioned to both of these friends that I actually have a reservation at a restaurant where I have two seats actually where both of them could come instead of coming out with me. Since they're going with someone else. I would love to celebrate with them because they are my best friends they both agreed and said they would definitely come. So my sister graduated 2 years ago when we went out after her graduation, my mom and my dad both split the bill for everyone that went with us. I did not mention to either of these friends that their dinner would be paid for. I only invited them and told them what time and what restaurant so they know what to wear. I did not see my parents when I got back home from practicing with my friends because they were already in bed.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"AITA for inviting two of my friends to my graduation lunch?  AITA for inviting 2 friends to a reservation lunch for my graduation celebration? Hi Reddit, I am new here so I don't really know how to write a story question. But I am in a situation where my stepmom is upset with me yet again. So I graduate very very soon and about a few days ago I made reservations to a more expensive but not unjustified expense restaurant for 12 people because I have about that many people coming to my graduation. Two of which have canceled coming to the graduation and the dinner because they can no longer make it. So we are back down to 10 people coming to dinner in total. My stepmom has made the reservations for me and she asked me how many people. I told her 12 because of the count that I had in my head. I was out with my friends practicing for a game that we have every single week except this week because we have a bye week. I was playing with four of my friends and two that were already invited but could no longer make it weeks prior to making the reservation in general so they were not included. The other two I was planning on just going out to bars with. My one friend told me she was going out with another graduate who she has been friends with since childhood, so I understood. I mentioned to both of these friends that I actually have a reservation at a restaurant where I have two seats actually where both of them could come instead of coming out with me. Since they're going with someone else. I would love to celebrate with them because they are my best friends they both agreed and said they would definitely come. So my sister graduated 2 years ago when we went out after her graduation, my mom and my dad both split the bill for everyone that went with us. I did not mention to either of these friends that their dinner would be paid for. I only invited them and told them what time and what restaurant so they know what to wear. I did not see my parents when I got back home from practicing with my friends because they were already in bed. So this morning when I saw them I mentioned to my stepmom that those two friends are planning on coming since we have the two seats left over. She said in response so we're just inviting people for your parents to pay for? I told her I was not expecting for anybody to pay for their dinner except themselves.

123,1cnut0u,AITA for expecting more from my friend?,"tl;dr - a close friend completely abandoned me, although unintentionally. AITA for expecting him to care more than he did?

on the phone so apologies if this feels rant-y. i had a recent experience with a friend that negatively changed the way i viewed him and our relationship. i'm worried that i'm being irrational or selfish.

a few weeks back, i was staying a couple of nights in another state for a robotics tournament with the rest of my team. second night in, i got super ill overnight, and didn't get any sleep from how uncomfortable i was. i still had to be up at 6 the second day for the tournament, beginning one of the worst 12 hours of my life as i wandered around the convention center feeling like an actual zombie. it didn't help that i also got my period on the same day. the entire time, i was just praying for the day to end.

i'd like to preface this next part by acknowledging that i was much much more sensitive than usual due to both being sick and on my period. i was also feeling homesick, and did not want to be alone. a lot of things that usually wouldn't bother me suddenly did. two friends that i got onto an elevator with would hit random floors in an attempt to lose me (i'd get off on one floor being confused and they'd try to close the door behind me and leave). someone shouting at me to leave the moment they see me walk into a room because i'm usually too energetic and they wanted to study. i'm just feeling completely exhausted and rejected to the point of tears, blaming it on congestion if someone asked.

earlier that evening, i had lost my id card somewhere in my room, and i called up my close friend, the one mentioned in the title, to help me look for it. i was still trying to keep it together, but it must've been pretty obvious that something was up, because he kept asking me if something happened. after a few times i finally just broke down. i don't think i've ever cried like that in front of someone who wasn't my mom, just full on choking back sobs. i think i put him in a kind of awkward spot, because he just listened quietly and let me talk.

after, someone walked in, and i had to collect myself quickly. i asked my friend if he wanted to go somewhere, and he gave me the number of the room i had just told him i got kicked out of.  i was confused, and almost thought that he wanted to confront them on my behalf until he turned to me and told me to leave since they didn't want me there before. i was completely stunned. i had always thought of this person as a good friend, and assumed he felt the same way. we got close in the first place back when he was in a bad place over a girl and i would stay up late with him just talking about how he felt. it's not that i wanted something in return, i really do care about him, but i guess i just couldn't help but expect him to do the same. recently i just haven't had the energy to speak to him, and i think he's noticed/upset as well.

I went no contact with my mother since last October and she would reach out occasionally by reacting to my stories and posts on Facebook. (I restricted on fb her since a month ago so she can‚Äôt see my stories or new posts anymore). Long story short, she  cheated on my father and continuously chooses her unemployed, man-child boyfriend over her own kids for the past 20 years. My sister and I have tried to be cordial with them, and raise our concerns with our mother privately many many times. But they are both controlling, toxic, and narcissistic. 

Anyways, I got engaged in February and didn‚Äôt tell my mother directly about it and had announced it on social media. My sister is still in contact with my mother but she now lives in another country so she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with her directly. My sister told me that my mom felt hurt that I didn‚Äôt tell her about my engagement and my sister responded to her by telling her that she‚Äôs not the victim (lol). I didn‚Äôt want to break my no-contact boundary since she knows exactly why I went no contact but refuses to acknowledge/own-up/change. If I reach out to her about milestones/celebrations, she will use that as an excuse to say ‚Äúhey everything is ok and I can sweep all the pain I caused under the rug once again.‚Äù

However this is the first Mother‚Äôs Day since I‚Äôve went no-contact and it‚Äôs her birthday this month as well. For me, it was an easier decision to not reach out to her about my engagement, but this feels different. I want to keep my no-contact boundary but I still can‚Äôt help but feel guilt or like an asshole for not reaching out and wishing her a happy birthday or Mother‚Äôs Day (even though she is a shitty mother).
Would I be cruel for not reaching out? Should I send a short message and block her right after?

Edit: one thing I forgot to mention is that I didn‚Äôt explicitly tell my mother that I was forming a boundary and going NC. I just stopped communication after a blow-up incident that happened last October when my sister was visiting our hometown and we had a family gathering. 
Essentially my mother‚Äôs boyfriend made my sister cry and was being verbally aggressive during this gathering. That was my final straw because he did the same thing the previous year when my sister visited and he yelled at everyone because they weren‚Äôt paying attention to a movie he wanted everyone to watch. Both times, my mother pretended that she was ‚Äúscolding‚Äù him for his behavior but then she continued to make excuses for him and lie to cover-up how shitty he is. After the second incident, she told me that she was going to leave him. However, now, she is still making excuses for him to my sister and saying how he is now employed and is in therapy. (none of his employment lasted for than 6 months to a year).

Essentially, I am wondering if I should straight-up tell her that I‚Äôm going no contact until I see changes in behavior, or if I should just continue with having no contact, continue with the status quo.

129,1cntde9,AITA for saying I won't take part willingly in a new Mother's Day tradition?,"So my (16m) mom died 7 years ago. And things have changed a lot since then. About a year after my mom died my aunt (dad's sister) died and he took on two kids who were babies when my aunt died. I didn't know my aunt and dad never knew she had kids or anything. So it was a big change that happened after a big loss/change in our lives. Since dad had my cousins he would let me go to my aunt and grandma for Mother's Day and we'd celebrate mom on that day. My aunt was also married with kids and they'd be with us too. For me it's the best way to spend Mother's Day because I miss my mom like crazy and kinda hate the day in some ways because she's not here.

Two years ago my dad met his new wife. She had three kids already and before they had a chance to introduce us all she got pregnant. So things went super fast and we met each other and she and her kids moved in, their baby was born 7 months ago and they got married 3 months ago.

My dad and his wife were talking about Mother's Day and they wanted to start a Mother's Day tradition for ""our"" family. That includes us all. I heard about it two nights ago when I got up to get some water and they were discussing some last minute stuff. Mainly dad telling me and my grandma and aunt. I told him I didn't want to take part in their tradition and I wanted to keep my own. He told me traditions change. I told him I already hated the day enough and I didn't want to celebrate his new wife. I told her that I just wanted my family. She told me she and the kids are my family now and she's the mom of the family. I told dad he knew how much I struggle with Mother's Day already. He said he knew, but he wanted us to be a close family and he didn't want me standing outside of it. I told him that will happen when he forces this for two years or not, because I'll never consider his wife my mom and I'll never look at her as a mother figure for me. I told him I have two amazing ones in my life and I lost my mom. I told him he has no idea what it's like to lose your mom. But it's one of the worst things that can happen.

He told me they really weren't okay with me missing out on starting new traditions as a family. I told him I won't take part willingly. That they will be forcing it every step of the way. His wife said I could at least try. I told her I shouldn't have to when I don't have a mom to celebrate. They should be more accepting of that. I told her she has both her parents too so she can't understand either.

They both got really annoyed with me for refusing to change my stance. I told them one more time that I won't take part willingly. Dad tried talking to me on his own but he got more frustrated because I tried to be open about how it all made me feel.

Two years ago my dad met his new wife. She had three kids already and before they had a chance to introduce us all she got pregnant. So things went super fast and we met each other and she and her kids moved in, their baby was born 7 months ago and they got married 3 months ago.

My dad and his wife were talking about Mother's Day and they wanted to start a Mother's Day tradition for ""our"" family. That includes us all. I heard about it two nights ago when I got up to get some water and they were discussing some last minute stuff. Mainly dad telling me and my grandma and aunt. I told him I didn't want to take part in their tradition and I wanted to keep my own. He told me traditions change. I told him I already hated the day enough and I didn't want to celebrate his new wife. I told her that I just wanted my family. She told me she and the kids are my family now and she's the mom of the family. I told dad he knew how much I struggle with Mother's Day already. He said he knew, but he wanted us to be a close family and he didn't want me standing outside of it. I told him that will happen when he forces this for two years or not, because I'll never consider his wife my mom and I'll never look at her as a mother figure for me. I told him I have two amazing ones in my life and I lost my mom. I told him he has no idea what it's like to lose your mom. But it's one of the worst things that can happen.

He told me they really weren't okay with me missing out on starting new traditions as a family. I told him I won't take part willingly. That they will be forcing it every step of the way. His wife said I could at least try. I told her I shouldn't have to when I don't have a mom to celebrate. They should be more accepting of that. I told her she has both her parents too so she can't understand either.

They both got really annoyed with me for refusing to change my stance. I told them one more time that I won't take part willingly. Dad tried talking to me on his own but he got more frustrated because I tried to be open about how it all made me feel.

Anyway, WIBTA if I got him to pass on a Mother‚Äôs Day cupcake from me to her? I truely hope it can serve as a bit of a peace offering to show her I don‚Äôt mean any harm. But could it also maybe be seen as petty?

131,1cnsxku,AITA for questioning the way that my parents baby my brother?,"I (15F) have a brother (19M). Whilst having no clear diagnosis, we believe that he may be on the autistic spectrum, from the way that he speaks, matures and interacts with different things.

In the last year, he got a job at a local swimming pool, life guarding. He has no set shifts and has to put his name forward for work, and so he has to total his pay himself. Whilst I appreciate that he may need some help when totalling this, to make sure it's completely right, my parents seem to make no effort to teach him to do it on his own. Instead, it seems he gives them the numbers and they do it completely for him. It used to be the same with his shifts, they were always almost telling him what shifts he should do instead of him making that decision by himself. I just think that by doing this, they're not helping him at all with developing life skills and at the same time treating him like a child by doing it for him, when he is very much grown.

My parents also make no effort to correct him on the way he speaks to me, acts around me, and how he constantly feels the need to wind me up/go out of his way to annoy me. We support different football teams, and whenever someone scores against my team he always cheers for them and rubs it in. Annoying, yes. Maybe not something I should let get to me. But when I do it, it isn't okay and my parents always tell me to stop. I once approached my mother about this, and the only answer she gave me was ""He doesn't understand.""...

Also, he is incapable of holding himself accountable, and my parents are equally incapable of holding him accountable. He'll curse at his video games, eat food that my parents had specifically bought for me, do or say something that makes me or my parents upset, and when confronted, its everyone else's fault.
For example, we were watching a football match once and he said something derogatory regarding one of the players that I didn't agree with at all. He continued to push this, and eventually I left the room. I told my mother, and she simply said; ""I will speak to him."" The next day in the car, I bring it up, and he simply says, ""Maybe you need to get a sense of humour, it was funny."" And my mother made absolutely no effort (after one sentence of disagreement, before backing down) to scold him.

But if it was me? Silent treatment for days (as has happened before).

Any time I try to approach my parents about it, it's the same answer; ""He doesn't think like you do"", ""he doesn't understand"", ""you need to be patient with him""

And maybe I do, but I think there should be an equal approach. That's just me though.

But it was always my forehead (we were a trio btw) and i was insecure of that, they called me megamind blabpabla i explained to them MANY TIMES that i didnt like that and anything else was fine EXCEPT my forehead. So the invevitable comes and we fall out. they are on each others side and i am obviously on my own, so i go with my bsf, we'll call her Saturn, because space. And they hate Saturn, why? Simply because she was 'annoying' (she wasnt) and fast forward alot of arguments, they tell my to off myself so i leave, right? Cause thats not.. For seven months. Then i come back because my friend said second chance (they did not know about about them telling me to off myself) so i do, what happens? Another arguement. But i stay in contact with them still talking abt my forehead. So i eventually am like, stop i told you i dont like it, and you still do it. And they go with the fact that i insult them as a joke blabla, and i say something akong the lines of, i said not my forehead but you still do. I told you you can insult me but not my forehead blablabla, im genuinely curious if im the ahole, honest opinions. (im a girl btw)",0.0,0.06851756572723389,0,1
138,1cnsdmm,AITA for wanting to eat a dessert in a restaurant?,"So my boyfriend (29m) and me (28f) are currently travelling through Italy. Yesterday we would take a train from Florence to our next hotel in the countryside of Tuscany. We were going to have a last dinner there yesterday night, I chose a place that has the best tiramisu in Florence according to insta and we didn't manage to go there earlier. Our meal took a bit longer than expected and my boyfriend reminded me that the last train we could take was at 21.40, the next train would only come early in the morning. He said that it would be too tight to eat dessert and that we should just pay and leave to make it to the train. According to my estimation we had 20 minutes left, so it would either be 20 minutes waiting in the station or 20 minutes in the restaurant, no big deal. 

When the waiter came and asked if we wanted anything else I quickly ordered the tiramisu. Without having to read the menu first i figured it would be fast enough to make our train still. My boyfriend got kind of red and asked me why i did that. I just told him that they will bring it out soon and that we have plenty time to make the train. 

So it took a little longer than expected and by the time it came I only had time to snap a few quick pictures and eat it fast. I offered my boyfriend some of it but he said he didn't want any. We paid and left, it was tight now but still possible so we grabbed our luggage and made a run for it. In the end we made it, I admit that there was barely any time left but we got in the train a couple minutes before we left. I sat down and just felt such relief that everything worked out. My boyfriend just threw the bags down and sat somewhere else for a moment untill the train left. I called out to him and told him to come sit with me. I started talking about how we did it but he cut me off and asked me in an angry tone ""why i had to have that dessert"". He complained about running halfway through the city and almost missing the train. 

I felt very hurt and was a bit scared to be honest, I have never seen him angry like this. We argued the whole train ride and on the way to our hotel. There he eventually just said that he was exhausted, turned around and went to sleep. I cried myself to sleep at night and woke up feeling very horrible. He is still asleep and I come here to ask you if I am the asshole here. 

Update: wow I did not expect this much response so thanks for the insight i guess. I take it that i am the asshole and that over 10.000 people feel that way... I am not going to respond to every comment here, we are still on vacation and no way that I am scrolling through all of that right now.

I just wanted to clear up that we talked it through by now, I apologised for making us run late and he also feels sorry for getting that angry. We will try to enjoy the rest of our trip and make the best of it. 
Just some things I would like to clear up because some of you have been really mean, fair i get that I came here to be judged but I just want to clear some things up.

1. 20 minutes meant 20 minutes left after paying and going to the station. I didn't think it would be a good idea to eat, pay, go, find the train and board in 20 minutes.

2. We have been cutting it short many times this trip, sometimes for me sometimes for him. For example in Rome due to our plans we would either have to skip vatican or Colosseum or plan both in the same day. He made out that it would be possible and we did make it. Arriving right on time and we celebrated making it, i figured this would be similiar.

3. Grow up with the instagram hate, loads of people browse social media about a place before visiting. I am not a wannabe influencer but I like checking which places in a city are must see/do. There is always limited time and this way I feel we avoid tourist trap places. My boyfriend doesn't mind this and often asks for my research when we are deciding on a place to eat.

4. Pictures are memories! Seriously, it's not just for other people but also for myself. I love making physical albums and looking through them. These pictures will be seen by our kids and grandkids one day. I don't take pictures all the time and really do enjoy the places we visit in the moment. Just that I also take a moment to record those memories for the future, shoot me for that i suppose.

5. Some debate got going about me getting scared. Just want to clear up that my boyfriend is not abusive and that I was just scared because he was so angry. It's scary when someone you love is angry at you, I was afraid he would hate me or break up with me. 

Also some of you have gone into my personal messages to use language that I guess is not allowed in the comments here. Again, grow up I'm sure you are breaking some kind of rule from this sub but I won't report, just leave me alone. ",Asshole,2024-05-09,"AITA for wanting to eat a dessert in a restaurant?

139,1cnrkw9,AITA for not letting my half sister wear anything of my mom's on her wedding day?,"I (30f) have a half sister (23f) who'll be getting married sometime in 2025. Half sister is my dad's child. She's actually the child he had after an affair while married to my mom. My parents divorced when my mom learned dad had cheated on her and things became more tense after she found out the person he cheated with had gotten pregnant. My dad told her that the other woman was out of the picture and my mom could have a second child she always wanted and we could be a family. I was there for part of the conversation because dad wanted me to ""be excited for a sibling"" and thought it would win my mom over.

My mom stood firm with dad. Dad would tell my half sister that we had the same mom. He'd talk like that around me and tell me to shut it when I told him to stop lying. He also told me mom could be a kind person and step up for a child who had no mother (according to him the affair partner found someone else to be the affair partner of and didn't want to know my half sister) When I was 11 my mom died. So I went to live with dad. About a year later dad got married. But even after he got married he taught my half sister that my mom was her mom. I'll say whatever hope we had of a relationship was ended by my dad doing this, because she wouldn't believe me when I told her she had a different mom and she hated me for not giving her photos and stuff of mom's and for not making my family acknowledge her as their granddaughter like I was acknowledged.

My dad's wife never became mom to my half sister even though she admitted to desperately wanting one because she was so hung up on my mom.

Mom left me everything and my grandparents took care of the stuff for me until I became independent. I wore some of mom's wedding jewelry on my wedding day as well as her veil. I didn't invite my dad or any of his family, including half sister. But she saw photos.

So she reached out to me on social media and told me she wanted some of mom's stuff for her wedding and I said no. She told me now is not the time to be selfish and I told her she's entitled to nothing and she'll have to find other things to wear. She called me names and I told her dad should really have admitted the truth to her by now. She said she didn't know why I was so adamant she wasn't mom's kid and it's not fair because I got to be raised by mom for 11 years while she got nothing and for no reason at all.

Afterward my dad's wife reached out and told me how upset my half sister was and asked me to please consider giving something because dad really fucked her over and she feels hated by mom and by me. My half sister messaged again after this and told me I was being really unfair to her and how I made mom's abandonment of her even worse.

140,1cnqvtj,AITA for telling my roommate that she's not my mother?,"Throwaway and fake names because I know for sure that at least one person involved in this is on here.



I (24F) live with my best friend since high school (25F) and her old neighbors, Teresa (42F), Christian (45M) and their three kids, Faith (15F), 12M, and 8F. We are in a 6Bd/3.5Bath house in Oregon.



The main issue that we just went through. I picked up a second job as an overnight server about 5 months ago, because Teresa had an unexpected medical emergency that almost completely drained her savings. She sat my friend and I down after it happened and asked us to pay a portion of her rent/utilities until she could get her finances back in order. Neither my friend or I were very stoked about this arrangement, but it was supposed to be temporary. Doing these 12 hour shifts at the company my friend, Christian and I are all at, then going and doing the server job has messed up my sleep schedule and left me almost no free time.



After working two weeks straight between the two jobs, I got home a couple nights ago, having just finished one of my 12 hour shifts. Thankfully, I was off the next day and just wanted to get some food and go enjoy my liquor fridge (mini fridge in my room that I keep my alcohol in). Teresa confronted me as I was in the kitchen about how I didn't help around the house much anymore and I needed to step up my household contributions or she would be looking into getting me off the lease and giving away my room.



Teresa obviously didn't appreciate me yelling at her and told me that I was being a brat. She said that it wasn't her fault that I was working so much and that all she was asking was that I clean up after myself and not leave my things all over the house. Here's the thing though, I don't leave my things all over the house. Faith has a tendency to just grab things, without making sure that they're hers. I've had to invest in a lock on my door and cameras in my room because so many things were moved and/or taken. Teresa then told me that maybe I'd have more money and wouldn't need to work so much if I didn't spoil my brother so much. I'll admit, I do spoil him. As I said earlier, I send him little gifts and messages and things all the time. I miss him a lot and I basically raised him because of our mothers alcoholism, so I mostly do it so he knows I'm thinking of him.



This is when I lost my temper completely. I went off on Teresa and told her that just because she's being a controlling bitch like my mother, that didn't make her my mother and that she doesn't get to tell me what to do with my money, especially when my money is what's currently keeping a roof over her kids heads. We ended up getting into a screaming match that woke up Christian and my friend (the kids were at their grandmas) and now we're not speaking. I feel like Teresa way overstepped. Frankly, as long as I'm coming up with my portion of the bills, I don't feel like it's any of her business what I spend the rest of my money on.

141,1cnqo8r,AITA for posting photos of my parents on my social media because my dad's wife can't do anything about it?,"My mom died 9 years ago. I (17m) was the oldest and my twin siblings are two years younger but remember mom like I do. It was 2 years later when dad met his second wife ""Jen"" and Jen moved in with us about a year afterward and they got married a few months after that. When Jen moved in we had to remove all photos of mom from the house. We were allowed one photo that couldn't be easily seen in each of our bedrooms. But it had to blend in so Jen wouldn't see the photos when our doors were open (a rule in dad's house). We hated it. I always felt like dad took away our home to make it Jen's home. I don't see it the same way. But then again I don't feel like I live with ""parents"" I feel like I live with a sorta parent who changed badly when mom died and the spouse he met afterward who really isn't someone I'll ever care much about.

The positive to it all is we got to maintain a relationship with our maternal family. This is something that is the most ""dad"" out of dad's behavior since mom died. Our grandparents were our babysitters when our parents needed one. They sometimes had us for days at a time if our parents went away anywhere. Plus they were around all the time when mom was alive. Dad keeping that relationship going is one of the only reasons I don't completely hate him for putting Jen's comfort so far ahead ours.

My grandparents and two of my aunts have lots of photos of mom in their house still. They're big on photos in general and never took any down after mom died. They even have wedding photos and such. When Jen became aware of that she got so annoyed. She tried to confront one of my aunts about it and said it wasn't healthy for us to see photos of our dead mother everywhere and my aunt told her to mind her own fucking business.

So I have social media. Lately I have been using my social media to see photos of my mom again and to share stuff about our family, when we were an actual family and not just three siblings who basically lost their dad in most ways after their mom died. I know it bothers Jen, which makes me love doing it even more. I now only use it when I'm with my maternal family and I sign out when going to dad's so Jen can't make me take it down. But I triggered her last week and she's been pissed off ever since. I shared three photos of my family and talked about my parents and how many happy memories I have of when we were a family. Jen wasn't mentioned and I shared no photo of her at all. This bothered her and the fact I focused so much on my mom. She told me to stop posting photos of mom and to take down the family post. She told me I'm disobeying her and my dad by posting them. She got dad involved and he asked me if I'd take them down and I told him no. He left it there but Jen said I'm posting them to spite her and that's wrong. She told me she deserves more respect than that.

Also, this jealousy from Jen is more about her not liking that dad lost mom than about my siblings and me.

I (24F) live with my best friend since high school (25F) and her old neighbors, Teresa (42F), Christian (45M) and their three kids, Faith (15F), 12M, and 8F. We are in a 6Bd/3.5Bath house in Oregon. My friend moved to Oregon a couple years ago, due to personal reasons and ended up in the same apartment complex as Teresa and Christian. Apparently black mold developed in the pipes and was making all them super sick and destroying their stuff. Cue them wanting to move and wanting me to move in with them. I was going through a rough time with my mother and eventually, we got into a big enough fight that I loaded my car with my cat and my most important/sentimental things and also just my basic necessities and drove from Wyoming to Oregon. I left my younger brother (13) behind because there was no feasible way for me to bring him along, but I talk to him as much as I can and I send him gifts all the time.

When I first moved in with everyone, Christian had gotten me a job at the company he worked at. I appreciated this a lot because I honestly had no idea what I was ging to do for work once I got up there. I work a lot of overtime and get paid decently, so I make about $2600/month. My friend is in a similar job and makes about the same. Teresa makes about $2100/month and gets about $500/month in food stamps. Now, I know that's not always a lot, especially with three kids, but she only works part-time and could make more if she would move to full-time but she doesn't want to, for some reason.

On to the main issue that we just went through. I picked up a second job as an overnight server about 5 months ago, because Teresa had an unexpected medical emergency that almost completely drained her savings. She sat my friend and I down right after it happened and asked us to pay a portion of her part of the rent and utilities until she could her finances back in order. Neither my friend or I were very stoked about this arrangement, but it was supposed to be temporary and we both grew up kinda poor, so we know that sometimes, things just happen and you have to make it work however you can. The thing is, doing these 10-12 hour shifts at the company my friend, Christian and I are all at, and then going and doing the server job has totally messed up my sleep schedule and left me almost no free time to get any of my own things done. Part of the problem is that I've also been covering at the server job a lot as well, but hey, gotta get that dough, right?

  
After working two weeks straight between the two jobs, I got home a couple nights ago, having just finished one of my 12 hour shifts. Thankfully, I was off the next day and frankly, just wanted to get some food and go enjoy my liquor fridge (mini fridge in my room that I keep my alcohol in). Teresa confronted me as I was in the kitchen, going on about how I didn't help around the house very much anymore and I needed to step up my household contributions or she would be looking into getting me off the lease and giving away my room.

  
Now, I'll admit I got loud. I told her that she had no right to threaten to kick me out and legally couldn't without talking to the landlord. (I understand that's why she mentioned getting me off the lease, but I was half asleep as I was yelling this at her.) I asked her what the hell she meant by ""stepping up my household contributions?"" I told her that along with bailing her out on her portion of the rent, which I shouoldn't even be having to do anymore (she told my friend and I that we would only need to cover her part for 3-4 months), I frequently brought home food for her kids from my serving job, I frequently watched her younger kids when she needed it and that I cooked and cleaned all the time. She told me that it was ridiculous that my friend and I had our own fridge in the basement (we talked to Teresa, Christian and the landlord before buying it and hooking it up, they all OK'ed it). I reminded Teresa that my friend and I got that fridge specifically so that she could have peace of mind about her kids food (her son has a sensitivity to red meat and a few other things) and that we paid the difference in the energy bill that our fridge caused. I also reminded her that despite the fact that my friend and I pay for all our own groceries, I constantly use my own food to cook for the whole household on my days off and I don't even ask her to pay me back for any groceries I use to do this. Christian has offered in the past, but I've never taken him up on it.

  
Teresa obviously didn't appreciate me yelling at her and told me that I was being a brat. She said that it wasn't her fault that I was working so much and that all she was asking was that I clean up after myself and not leave my things all over the house. Here's the thing though, I don't leave my things all over the house. Faith has a tendency to just grab things, without making sure that they're hers, whether that be shoes, food, drinks, electronics. She will grab anything and just walk away with it or start doing something with it. I've had to invest in a lock on my door and cameras in my room because so many things were moved and/or taken. Teresa then told me that maybe I'd have more money and wouldn't need to work so much if I didn't spoil my brother so much. I'll admit, I do spoil him. As I said earlier, I send him little gifts and messages and things all the time. I miss him a lot and I basically raised him because of our mothers alcoholism, so I mostly do it so he knows I'm thinking of him.

  
This is when I lost my temper completely. I went off on Teresa and told her that just because she's being a controlling bitch like my mother, that didn't make her my mother and that she doesn't get to tell me what to do with my money, especially when my money is what's currently keeping a roof over her kids heads. We ended up getting into a screaming match that woke up Christian and my friend (the kids were at their grandmas) and now we're not speaking. I do feel a bit bad because the comment about my money keeping a roof over her kids heads was unnecessary, but I feel like Teresa way overstepped. Frankly, as long as I'm coming up with my portion of the bills, I don't feel like it's any of her business what I spend the rest of my money on.

144,1cnq4jv,AITA for not telling my cousin her son and dil are pregnant,"My cousin and her son are estranged. There are a lot of reasons but her son has decided to cut her out of his life and seems happier for it. I have a relationship with him. We don‚Äôt see each other often and really don‚Äôt speak much but when he messages me I respond and I check in on him and his wife once in a while. 

He messaged me and let me know they were pregnant. Nine days later he spoke with my mother. She called me and told me the news. I told her I knew and was happy for them. She asked if I was going to tell my cousin. I said no, it isn‚Äôt my information and if he wants her to know he should tell her himself. That side of my family is awful with gossip and rumors and I try to stay out of it as much as possible. My mother thought he wanted them to know but just didn‚Äôt want to tell them himself. She said she was going to tell her sister (my aunt). 

Of course it got around the family and my cousin found out. In a group text with her sister, my mother and a childhood friend she was lamenting that those of us who had a relationship with him were ‚Äúallowing‚Äù him to get away with his ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù behavior by not doing enough to convince him to stay in contact with her and the rest of his immediate family. On one hand she was pissed that we had a relationship with him and in the same breath asking us to share information with her. Her sister questioned this and said she didn‚Äôt feel it was right that she not respond to her nephew. She basically said she was going to have a relationship with him and would do what she could to help him back to his family. The other responses were similar. My cousin then said she would like to see pictures of the kid, etc. 

I was working when the text came in. When I got a chance to read it I backed up what her sister had said and tried to reassure her that him having his own child might make him appreciate what it takes to be a parent and it could be what brings them back together. She lost it on me. She came at me with things like I had known for months and didn‚Äôt tell her, if the tables were reversed how would I feel, she was snarky and out of control.  I didn‚Äôt handle it well. I was trying to be supportive and I felt attacked. I told her to fuck off. I went on to tell her that she didn‚Äôt know what I knew or when and she hadn‚Äôt asked me directly about any of it. She still hasn‚Äôt. This isn‚Äôt the first time she has believed the family rumor mill and been pissed at me without getting the whole story. So - did I know, yes. Did I know for months and months- no, but I don‚Äôt think that matters because I feel very strongly that if it isn‚Äôt my information I shouldn‚Äôt share it. Does that make me the asshole?

145,1cnq1q0,WIBTA for telling my younger cousin that I don't want to see her anymore,"I(24f) have been debating whether or not I should tell my cousin(18f) that I don't want her in my life anymore. For context, my cousin is the daughter of my father's favorite cousin and growing up it was very apparent to me that while he could give less than a shit about me he loved my cousin. My father is an emotionally abusive man who spent the beginning of my life yelling and berating me for anything he could until the time I turned 14 and he decided that he was just gonna ignore my existence and cut me out completely.

In contrast, my father loves his cousin and thus he loves his daughter. He would make sure to take the time to send her birthday gifts every year and would go out of his way to fly out to see her during special events. The man who couldn't bother to come to my high school graduation was willing to fly across the country just so he could attend her middle school one. This unfortunately has led me to have some really complicated emotions for that entire branch of the family. And the worse part about it is that they love me. They are always calling to talk to me and asking after me and my cousin thinks of me like a older sister. I've tried really hard to not let them know how I feel because at the end of the day it's none of their faults that I get nauseous whenever I talk to them and have to prepare myself mentally so I don't breakdown crying whenever I talk to them and they casually mention something about my dad. And I didn't want to be that person who took out my feelings on a kid so I always played with her when she would come looking for me.

Honestly I planned on never talking about these feelings and just slowly distancing myself from them. However recently my cousin called me to tell me that she was accepted at my college and that she was so excited to be able to go to school together. She told me that  dad said she could live at my parent's house and commute to school using my old car. I told her that's great and then faked an excuse to get off the phone and am now sitting here writing this because I am honestly going though a breakdown.

I love her, I really do but I don't seem to love her enough to be able to do this. Every time I see her I feel nauseous and hate myself a little. I'm just getting my life together and only recently moved out and the though of her moving into my old house, living in my old bedroom and playing family with my dad honestly just makes me want to cry. I've never wanted to explain all this to her but I also feel like she's old enough to understand. She isn't a little kid anymore and I don't want to hurt her because this isn't her fault, she's not responsible for my dad's actions but it doesn't change how I feel and for my own mental health I just can't be around her if she comes here, especially since seeing her would mean being near my dad again.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"WIBTA for telling my younger cousin that I don't want to see her anymore I(24f) have been debating whether or not I should tell my cousin(18f) that I don't want her in my life anymore.

I am concerned this resentment might make me act badly and have to control myself a lot. It is an instinctive thing I hate about myself and I wish I didn't feel like that but I do.

We got back to the house and my husband and one of my kids were sleeping.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was a little up set and told him ‚Äòif I was not ready like you told me to be you would be so mad‚Äô ‚Äò so please get up and let‚Äôs go‚Äô and he just laid there and said well I‚Äôm not going. I was really hurt because we planned this and I didn‚Äôt want to go by myself. But I sucked it up and I said okay. I did explain to him in text later that evening I was hurt he decided not to come. But no response. 
So we left and I took the food. And headed down. We got food and ate before we went to the field. I kind of had a hard time by myself but it was to be expected. I managed of course. We left the game at 915pm and I had to go to Walmart to get some essentials. I did and our commute from Walmart to our house is about 40mins. So we got home about 1045. Kids went straight to bed and he asked ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt bring us anything to eat?‚Äù I told him ‚Äúno‚Äù that they could‚Äôve cooked something or ate leftovers because I wanted to get home and we ate before the game. Which was part of the original plan. 
He got so mad and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll do ask me to do nothing and that he wasn‚Äôt going to help with our son‚Äôs birthday party this coming weekend‚Äù(it been planned for awhile now) & I told him really because I didn‚Äôt get you food?",2.0,0.9936273097991943,1,0
148,1cnpu7s,AITA for not wanting to go to a ghetto club on my birthday ?,"Things started to heat up between me and my cousins since last year and I really need some advice as what to do next. 

It was my (M28) birthday last September and on the same day as my birthday my cousin decided to do her wedding. Fine with me no problem. 

My cousins from another country came over for the wedding and even some from the states came over as it was a big wedding.

The three days before the wedding, I told my cousins to come over to my house and I did a BBQ for them and we had a good time.

The day before the wedding, one of my cousins says he wants to go to this club. It is a club in a really bad area so I didn‚Äôt want to go but my other cousins, who were staying with me, wanted to go. Even though I didn‚Äôt wanna go, specially the day before my birthday, I said ok let‚Äôs go, fine.

We get to the place, really ghetto and dangerous and there isn‚Äôt even any parking. I said I‚Äôm not going I can‚Äôt even find parking and it‚Äôs the night before my birthday and I want to go to this other place. I took some of my cousins with me and we went to the other club and had a good time.

At this point, my other cousins who stayed at the ghetto club, about 4 of them, are very upset me with. 

The next day of the wedding, it turns out my cousin, the one getting married, changed my seat, and didn‚Äôt put me with all my cousins. 

That night of the wedding, they didn‚Äôt talk to me. They didn‚Äôt say happy birthday to me at all. It was one of the worst nights of my life as I felt left out. I didn‚Äôt go to the after party that night. 
 
Until this day they haven‚Äôt talked to me and it‚Äôs been almost a year. One of them even unfollowed me on social media.

Now, was I wrong for not wanting to go to that ghetto club with me ? What should I do next ? Should I apologize or should I just move on and forget about them, delete them on social media and move on? 

Edit: to clarify, that night I invited them to the other club and I said I didn‚Äôt want to go to that one. Their style is just different that mine and some of my cousins and apparently they were meeting other friends there.

149,1cnpt07,AITA for turning off the movie my roommate and her boyfriend were watching?,"I was at the library studying pretty late last the other night, and when I came into my dorm at about 1:30 AM, my roommate and her boyfriend were laying on her bed watching a movie.  I was fairly sure they were asleep though, because both their eyes were closed.  So, I got ready for bed and then turned off the movie, but apparently my roommate's boyfriend was not asleep.

He started yelling at me and said ""What the fuck??"", so I replied ""Sorry, I have a final tommorow and it's late.  I thought you guys were asleep.""  He then said, ""Well you could at least say something, you don't have to be an asshole and just grab the remote"".  He has frequently been disrespectful to me while in our room, so I lost my temper and said ""Shut up or get out of my room"".  He yelled ""It's her room too"" (referring to my roommate).  I felt very anxious being yelled at, so I just got into bed and ignored him to try to diffuse the situation.  Then, he yelled at me again, saying ""You're parents didn't raise you right, and they certainly didn't teach you common sense"" (I have no idea what he was trying to say honestly, I think he was more aiming for ""they didn't teach you common courtesy""??) and left, slamming the door.

Anyway, now my roommate has been ignoring me and cancelled plans we had to hang out the other day.  I know turning the movie off may have been frustrating and losing your temper is never good, but was it really that big of a deal??  It's not going to affect me much longer because we move out in 3 days, but I still thought I'd ask: am I the asshole?

I do genealogy projects on the side. I just got a degree in research. I've always done good work. 
Recently I came in contact with Rachel (fake name). She was excited about genealogy. She hired me to find her ""Indian"" grandmother from the 1700s. I told her upfront that it was going to be hard/impossible. Colonial American research is difficult, especially women. She signed a contract with me to do a certain number of hours and gave me her family tree to look at the sources. She also put me in contact with her cousin who had more information. She also gave access to her tree and sent some things in an email. 
I go about my research, which it can take a while to find anything substantial.
Eventually I found something that looked good. I told her about it, and then she told her cousin. Then she comes back with ""oh, that's not right because of x, y, z."" Frustrating, but okay. Then I find some more stuff. Same process. She comes back after talking to her cousin. ""Oh, we already knew that. It's easy to mix the people up because so many have the same name."" Then I asked if I could get a list of the people that I shouldn't pursue. I was then told that would take too much time. Whelp, I guess I'm going to end up researching them. I keep going and the same thing keeps happening. Finally, I'm almost done with the allotted hours. She's feeling frustrated because I haven't given her anything new. I'm feeling frustrated because I keep thinking I find stuff only to be told it was already known, just not shared with me. Just as I was about to start writing the report she told me about a crucial piece of information that would have completely changed how I went about researching. I was done. I told her I couldn't continue the project. I wasn't going to make her pay me the remaining balance. (I have people pay 10% upfront, but she paid 1/2 of her own accord).

154,1cnp5ch,AITA for walking out of early mothers day family dinner?,"I (15f) live with my Mom (46f) and Dad (56m).

My dad and I have a good relationship, though it feels like my relationship with my dad is different from the typical father-daughter bond; instead, it's more like a brother-sister dynamic.We rarely engage in serious conversations and tend to joke around a lot.

My Dad is hypocritical, selfish, and sensitive to criticism, especially when Mom and I joke about him, though he jokes about us without hesitation. He struggles with seriousness and apologizing genuinely. When we discuss improvement, he feels ganged up on and doesn't care about my feelings..

My dad has never shown an effort to improve himself for our sake. Whenever my mom and I express concerns or share our feelings with him, he interprets it as criticism and shuts down. While we don't intend to make him feel like he needs fixing, he perceives our communication as a bombardment of his flaws. Unfortunately, he always ignores our emotions and fails to consider our perspectives.

Backstory, a couple months ago my dad and I were talking and I jokingly told my dad to ""shut your trap,"" which shocked both my parents. My mom told me how rude that was while my dad was sitting on the side not saying anything. I knew that was wrong of me to say and I did apologize but I didn't think much of it as my dad didn't say anything and just accepted my apology. A couple weeks later, everytime I said something to annoy him, he would say to me, ""shut your trap"". I honestly got really agrivated that he kept on saying that; afterall I did apologize to him when I said that. I told him to stop saying that because it annoyed me. However, he kept saying it.

Yesterday, the three of us (my mom, dad, and I) had an early mothers day dinner. We usually eat dinner as a family twice a week but it's hard to because of my parents' jobs. While eating dinner and my dad had said something to annoy me. So, in revenge, I had said, ""There's this kid in my grade and he is super smart unlike... (looks at my dad)"". He once again used the phrase to annoy me

I began to cry uncontrollably during dinner. The repeated use of that word by my dad, despite my pleas for him to stop, overwhelmed me with anger and frustration. I voiced my feelings to him. My dad responds, ""I have trauma from this too!!! I want you to feel the way I felt when you said that to me!"". I think the way he responded was extremely petty and 'kid' like. I told him I had no idea he had trauma from this because he never talked to me about it. Later, as my parents began to argue, I felt annoyed and the whole situation, so I left to my room.

This is common at my home. My Dad never disciplines or talks after arguments, then acts like nothing happened and gets annoyed when I don't talk to him.

Most importantly I feel bad for my mom. As it was an early mothers day dinner, instead she had to control out fights and argue with my stubborn child-like dad.

155,1cnonyt,AITA for not attending a Mother‚Äôs Day dinner?,"I (27F) was supposed to attend a Mother‚Äôs Day dinner on Saturday. I had specifically requested that evening off from my job so I could attend, as I haven‚Äôt seen most of the attendees since the holidays, with the exception of my grandmother that I saw on Sunday.

Now, my attending was already in question as I‚Äôd had to go to the ER on Monday for some fairly serious pain in my legs. I‚Äôm on the mend now, but have been advised to take it easy for the next few weeks and avoid driving, as I‚Äôm taking a muscle relaxer for part of it. Because of this and the drive across town (I live in Los Angeles), I was already advising everyone I may not be able to make it.

Then my Aunt (40sF) made the call for me today. I‚Äôm fairly tattooed, with colored hair and a septum piercing and my mother‚Äôs family has been very vocal about their disapproval. She texted me this evening to ask that I tone down the hair and not wear my septum ring, as she and my grandmother feel it‚Äôs disrespectful to them. She stressed that I‚Äôm a beautiful girl, but that the piercings and hair take away from my beauty and they worry about the company I keep and the men interested in dating me.

After reiterating the earlier point about my attendance not being guaranteed, she doubled down. She stated that I‚Äôm almost 30 and need to grow up, and that my grandfather wouldn‚Äôt approve.

I had specifically requested that evening off from my job so I could attend, as I haven‚Äôt seen most of the attendees since the holidays, with the exception of my grandmother that I saw on Sunday.

Now, my attending was already in question as I‚Äôd had to go to the ER on Monday for some fairly serious pain in my legs. I‚Äôm on the mend now, but have been advised to take it easy for the next few weeks and avoid driving, as I‚Äôm taking a muscle relaxer for part of it. Because of this and the drive across town (I live in Los Angeles), I was already advising everyone I may not be able to make it.

Then my Aunt (40sF) made the call for me today. I‚Äôm fairly tattooed, with colored hair and a septum piercing and my mother‚Äôs family has been very vocal about their disapproval. She texted me this evening to ask that I tone down the hair and not wear my septum ring, as she and my grandmother feel it‚Äôs disrespectful to them. She stressed that I‚Äôm a beautiful girl, but that the piercings and hair take away from my beauty and they worry about the company I keep and the men interested in dating me.

After reiterating the earlier point about my attendance not being guaranteed, she doubled down. She stated that I‚Äôm almost 30 and need to grow up, and that my grandfather wouldn‚Äôt approve.

Hi,
I like to attend the 10:30 am Sunday mass because there is less of a crowd. The church is only 35% full which means there are a lot of empty rows. Of ALL the empty rows, there‚Äôs this family that came and sat directly behind me. If you go to church, you know how uncomfortable this can be when someone is still kneeling and you want to sit back but can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre slouched over your chair.

But anyway, this family (mom and 2 teenagers) did not stop talking and laughing during the mass. Their loud whispers were very distracting where I couldn‚Äôt focus during mass.  AITAH for telling the family to keep it down or move elsewhere since technically I am in the house of the lord and should love thy neighbor??? I just don‚Äôt understand those people who go to mass to giggle left and right. Toddlers and crying babies are an exception but teenagers?? Come on, they should know better. What do you think?

Hi,
I like to attend the 10:30 am Sunday mass because there is less of a crowd. The church is only 35% full which means there are a lot of empty rows. Of ALL the empty rows, there‚Äôs this family that came and sat directly behind me.

166,1cnnwsz,WIBTA for not going to my friend‚Äôs birthday party,"Last year, at school, I met this girl and we became friends really quick. We always spent most of our time together, went out pretty often, studied together, etc. Basically, we could call each other bestfriends. She is WAY more extroverted than me. I have my little friend group I enjoy being around, while she is able to just talk to absolutely anyone and actually be liked. So, it‚Äôs clear that she has more friends than I do. In January of this year, she changed schools, so did her friend group. 

Later this week will be her birthday. She decided to host two parties, one for people that go to her new school (on Friday), and one for people she knew before (on Saturday). At first, she only invited me for the one on Saturday, where I know everyone and get along with. However, last week, she decided to also invite me for the Friday one. Not only does it start late (I basically have no ride there and back), but I also know literally no one there. Once again, I can‚Äôt just meet someone for the first time and suddenly be friends‚Äîso I‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôd be super awkward if I went. 

I texted her about this earlier today and she didn‚Äôt seem happy. She mentioned how some people that were supposed to go to the party cancelled (I lowkey felt really bad after she said this) and that I wouldn‚Äôt be making things awkward and that I‚Äôm overthinking things. So I‚Äôm like really hesitating, but at the same time I know I‚ÄôLL feel really awkward and probably wouldn‚Äôt enjoy being there. I really wouldn‚Äôt want to ruin the mood for everyone. Either way, I‚Äôm definitely going to the party on Saturday, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm straight up cancelling everything. 

So, will I be the asshole if I don‚Äôt go?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-09,"WIBTA for not going to my friend‚Äôs birthday party Last year, at school, I met this girl and we became friends really quick.
