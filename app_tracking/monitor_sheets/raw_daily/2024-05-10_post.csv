0,1coythp,WIBTA for telling my mum I don't want to interact with her boyfriend ,"My mum (55F) has had a boyfriend for maybe three years now, who I (20M) have never gotten along with. I tried to be civil, but he's someone who you either have to be overly friendly with or ignore flat out- he tries to speak to you and will repeat himself again and again until you laugh and agree with him.

That doesn't make him awful I guess (just fucking annoying,) but he also has a pattern of really creepy behaviour. I often have friends stay round mine after a night out, and every single girl who I've brought back has confided afterwards that he made them uncomfortable. (Overly familiar/complimenting, if not borderline aggressive to their partners if I had a houseparty or something)

He's also made me uncomfortable a lot- I'm a transgender man, but before I started hormones and started to actually look like a man, he was far too close with me even when I was visibly uncomfortable. He doesn't do that anymore, but still calls me a girl half the time even though I now have a mustache lol.

I really just wanted to ignore him, because I know my mum won't take it well- she has a history of ignoring shit like this, and I'm a university student now so I don't actually live with her at least 3/4 of the year.

Question is, WIBTA if I told her I don't want her boyfriend around when I'm at home? It'd cause a massive rift in their relationship, and I'm not around for most of the year so I don't know if it's worth it/fair on her (she's been single for a long time and had basically accepted that being the case for the rest of her life.) I also know she wouldn't be receptive to me saying anything, so it would cause a massive argument between us.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-05-10,"WIBTA for telling my mum I don't want to interact with her boyfriend  My mum (55F) has had a boyfriend for maybe three years now, who I (20M) have never gotten along with.

1,1cows6q,"AITA for ""grounding"" my adult sister? (UPDATE)","Before I start this update, I want to recommend reading my comments on my previous post. There were many questions that I was able to answer there.

It's very hard to explain my relationship with my younger sister in proper detail, but I will say that, while I love her dearly, Mia has always been a very inconsiderate person.

I have countless examples. She almost didn't attend our cousin's wedding last year because she didn't want to walk to the venue (which was two blocks away from our mom's place). We shared a bathroom when we were younger, and she'd insist on having the top drawers because she ""didn't want to crouch down"", but she was cool with me doing so. She slept through my college graduation, and didn't apologize for it.

I'm bringing this up now because whenever I asked Mia why she kept forgetting to use her key, her excuse was that looking through her bag took too long and the keypad was quicker. In her head, bothering other people is better than slightly inconveniencing herself.

After I established the curfew, Mia tried different ways to make me change my mind. She'd talk about not being able to cancel her tickets for Party X, or about the fun her friends had at Party Y. She'd show me her ""developing"" LinkedIn profile, and tell me she had learned her lesson and would be more responsible.

At first, I really didn't want to have to kick her out (which many of you suggested), but I have limits. A few days ago, I heard her complaining to her friends on the phone about her ""bitch of a sister"" who wouldn't let her do anything.

Later that day, I asked her which of our parents she planned on moving in with. Cue more fighting.

I managed to tell her that I had no obligation to continue housing her (for free!) if she couldn't respect my family. Mia could either move back in with our parents or continue living with me for the low price of respecting my infant son and stop complaining about it.

We did have a very productive conversation afterwards. I managed to get a lot off my chest, as did my sister. Mia apologized for everything. She admitted she'd been selfish, promised she'd make efforts to change and mature.

I'm a strong believer that people can change, which is why I'm not kicking her out right now. But I made it very clear that Mia is on thin ice, and the next time she does anything like this will be the last time she ever sees the inside of my home.

The curfew will continue until the end of the semester, as originally planned. My father also agreed to pay for Mia to go back to therapy. It helped her a lot when she was younger, so I'm hopeful about the future of this living situation.

I also want to thank those who suggested a white noise machine. My son is not a light sleeper, the keypad is just very loud and startles him awake, but my fiancé and I are still looking into getting one. Anything that helps our baby sleep better is welcome.

2,1cog1eb,WIBTA for not inviting my younger (12M) half-brother to my wedding and being completely honest about why?,"My fiancé (24F) and I (27M) are getting married in November and we had a mutual agreement that we would have an adult only wedding. My mom, however, thinks I should invite my younger half brother (12M) (we’ll call him Mark) to our wedding. She brought it up 2 weeks ago and we told her our rule and she suggested we still invite him because “he’s your brother and it would make your grandparents happy.” We both disagree. 

Now here’s some backstory before anybody asks: 
Mark is my dad’s only other son after me. Dad ran off when I was a kid, started a family, had Mark with then wife, then ran off again. My paternal grandparents got close to Mark and his mom and now the kid spends a lot of time with them. I feel like even tho I grew up with my grandparents for some time well before Mark was born, I don’t feel obligated to have any sort of relationship with my brother, I’ve only seen him 4 times in my life and 2 out of the 4 he was a baby. Huge age gap and we live like 8 states away. 

Back to the story. My mom sounded pretty upset and told me I had to tell my grandparents. I called them and said the invitation would only be for the two of them because we had a limited guest list…. Which is true but not the real reason. They understood. Now this is where it can all come back to haunt us and could make me the AH. We recently changed the location of the ceremony which would allow more guests if we wanted to but haven’t told my mom or grandparents.

This evening, i was doing just that. I noticed somebody getting out of the passenger side of a sedan, with civilian license plates. He was dressed business casual, had mirrored pilot sunglasses, and a clipboard. Of course, the car was parked illegally, partially blocking the driveway to the rooming house.

I was wondering if he was selling something, or what. Then he started up the sidewalk and up the stairs i was sitting atop. Approaching me, he asked if i lived here. I said yes. He asked if i mind letting him in. I replied, “yes. I do mind.”
He claimed to be a police officer, just “wanting to talk to somebody.” 
They always say that. 
I asked if he had a warrant. He said no. I suggested he call whoever it was he wanted to talk to and have them let him in.
He said he didn’t have a phone number, and told me, “you don’t have to be an a$$hole about it.” To which i replied, that i don’t appreciate being called an a—hole. Rather than apologize, he doubled down, saying that i was being uncooperative.
Such entitlement. 
This guy is a passenger in a civilian car and out of uniform. The only things that might identify him as a police officer were the radio on his belt, the badge around his neck, and his lousy entitled attitude.
I don’t even open the door for friends of friends. Sure, i see you visit my friend, regularly. But i can’t know if you’ve had a fight and aren’t here as a friend, this time.
So, i asked for his badge number. He said it as a full number, then the 3 individual digits, then, with a snide tone, asked me if i want him to write it down. To which i replied, “i may be an a—hole, but i’m not a dumb F—ing C…”
He had the audacity to tell me that i shouldn’t call myself an A hole. To which i responded, “no, i should leave that to you.”
After he left, unable to gain access to the building, rather than calm myself and head to the store, i went back inside and emailed the DOJ, since i live in a city who’s PD is under investigation, they have a dedicated email address, for our PD.

I was wondering if he was selling something, or what. Then he started up the sidewalk and up the stairs i was sitting atop. Approaching me, he asked if i lived here. I said yes. He asked if i mind letting him in. I replied, “yes. I do mind.”
He claimed to be a police officer, just “wanting to talk to somebody.” 
They always say that. 
I asked if he had a warrant. He said no. I suggested he call whoever it was he wanted to talk to and have them let him in.
He said he didn’t have a phone number, and told me, “you don’t have to be an a$$hole about it.” To which i replied, that i don’t appreciate being called an a—hole. Rather than apologize, he doubled down, saying that i was being uncooperative.
Such entitlement. 
This guy is a passenger in a civilian car and out of uniform. The only things that might identify him as a police officer were the radio on his belt, the badge around his neck, and his lousy entitled attitude.
I don’t even open the door for friends of friends. Sure, i see you visit my friend, regularly. But i can’t know if you’ve had a fight and aren’t here as a friend, this time.
So, i asked for his badge number. He said it as a full number, then the 3 individual digits, then, with a snide tone, asked me if i want him to write it down. To which i replied, “i may be an a—hole, but i’m not a dumb F—ing C…”
He had the audacity to tell me that i shouldn’t call myself an A hole. To which i responded, “no, i should leave that to you.”
After he left, unable to gain access to the building, rather than calm myself and head to the store, i went back inside and emailed the DOJ, since i live in a city who’s PD is under investigation, they have a dedicated email address, for our PD.
Edit: in case people might fear for my safety, in this situation, i am caucasian, therefore less likely to die from not kissing this bully’s butt, well enough",0.0,1.0359503,1,0
10,1coe3by,WIBTAH if I don't invite my brother to my wedding?,"I come from a large family and have a lot of siblings. One of my brothers and I do not have a real relationship. It hasn't been good for about seven years, and in that entire time we have spent maybe three hours total talking. We barely text, call or check in. When we do see each other at family functions, it is really awkward and we avoid one other. The reason why we have a bad relationship is a whole other post, so to keep that short, he wanted me to cover for him when he cheated on his wife (which I did not do). I do love my brother, but I do not like him. I do not want him involved in my life; he doesn't add anything positive to it.

Recently, my fiancé and I have been talking about planning our wedding within the next year or so. We have been working on saving to get our ideal venue, and we were talking about people we could cut out so that our necessary people could be guaranteed a seat (the venue caps at 100 people, and between the two of us, we have like 160 people). My brother happened to be someone I don't want to invite, and my fiancé is fully supportive of that. My brother is notorious for trying to embarrass people (especially us girls), and he did just that at two of my sisters' weddings.

I informed both of my parents about that decision, and they support me as well. My mother said while she would love for us all to get along, she understands we all have our own relationships and dynamics. My father said he fully understands my stance and will not work to sway me the other way. That made me feel much better knowing I had their support, and they said they won't say anything about it to anyone since that's my information to share if I choose to.

I then called one of my other brothers I am close with and asked for his opinion on the best way to approach this with the sibling I'm not inviting. I reached out to him specifically because he knows him the best and how he reacts. I don't want to send out invites and have him ask where his is, and I also don't want someone else to be the one to break the news to him. That would be a dick move in my eyes. I told him my plan is to have my fiancé there with me, or someone else, so that I have some comforting presence there. He told me that he thinks the whole thing is a bad idea.

He thinks I should still send him an invite and leave it to him to show up or not. If I don't want him there, then I should have that conversation with just him and not have anyone else there. He also mentioned he thinks I need to think it through some more because our other siblings who would go to the wedding would now be put in a really weird position with him; he would feel like everyone turned against him, or that he was left out, or that his other siblings shouldn't have gone because he isn't invited.

11,1coe011,AITA for wanting to get rid of a fish?,"For context: I (F16) have an aunt (F32?) who is a first time mom. She has an infant daughter who I believe is around 8 months old. They live upstairs with my uncle, who pays the rent at a reduced price since we're family. 

Yesterday, my aunt came down and handed me a plastic container with a betta fish in it. We don't speak English at home so what she said to me roughly translates to ""Here you go."" Then, she just left. I know this seems weird but she likes to bring stuff down like fruits she can't finish by herself. Already, the fish seemed in poor condition because there were feces in the water, the container was smaller than a cup, and it keep trying to escape. 

So, when my mom came home, I said that the fish was not my responsibility and that we should just hand it back to my aunt, who can deal with returning it. My mom then went to question my aunt about the fish. It was then that I found out my aunt had bought the fish to entertain her daughter but didn't want it after her daughter didn't look at it. To that, I said ""she (the baby) doesn't know what a fish is"" to my mom (which I thought was hilarious). Anyways, the issue is that my mom thinks the fish is going to survive if we just buy food. 

In response, I said it was ridiculous because who buys a fish without buying food in the first place. Second of all, the fish is living in a extremely small space and is constantly swimming upwards to escape. I also don't know how long it has been without food. My issue with the fish is the fact that it is not my responsibility to take care of it. However, I have a conscience and it's clear to me that the fish needs a bigger space as well. 

Now, it's become my problem to buy a tank and other necessities when I can't do that within the next few days when I have APs. I'm sure you don't have to be at home to take care of a fish but at this present moment, I cannot be researching places nearby, looking at tanks, and doing all that for something that wasn't my responsibility in the first place.

I have an amazing husband and two teens. My relationship with one of my children has been rather strained lately. As a result, I feel like a failure as a mother.

25,1coc8f2,AITA For accidentally not noticing when my wife was talking to me?,"Today I (30M) was laying in bed with my wife (30F) playing a video game together that we love, after a long stressful week. Our cat was also laying with us. We'd been having a pretty normal chill morning chatting and having fun with the game together. I made her a cup of coffee and had a little breakfast myself, and everything was pretty happy. At one point, since the cat was laying on the opposite side of me that she was, she leaned over onto me to pet him and was telling him how cute he was and cooing over him. This is pretty common, so I paid no mind and kept playing.

She apparently started saying something to me at that point. But since I was currently engrossed in a cutscene, and since she'd just been talking to the cat, I didn't realize she was now talking to me instead. She apparently even nudged me, but since she was already leaning on me moving around to pet the cat, I didn't notice the nudge and I think I just assumed it was part of her moving around to pet him. But then she got louder and got my attention, so I asked her to repeat what she'd said because I wasn't paying attention.

That set her off, and she got pissed at me for 'tuning her out'. I disagreed with that, because 'tuning her out' makes it sound like I was actively ignoring her on purpose and not caring, when actually I just hadn't been paying attention in the first place since I didn't realize she was addressing me. 'Tuning out' sounds to me like I knew she was talking to me, and simply chose to ignore her and not respond. Like I was mad or something and didn't want to listen to her. Which is so far from the case, as I value every thought and opinion she has, even IF I was mad. I just didn't realize at the time that she was talking to me and not the cat, so I just kept watching the cutscene, but I listened to her as soon as I realized she was talking to me.

She seems intent on believing that I did this on purpose, and when I ask her why she thinks I'd wilingly do something like that, her only reason she keeps giving me is that she even said my name, and ""well your ears didn't magically stop working"". I apologized repeatedly for not paying attention, and I understand that it was annoying for her to try to say something to me only for me to not notice. That's on me, I shouldn't have spaced out so hard, and should have been paying attention. But she seems to think this was a purposeful, conscious, malevolent thing I did out of malice or something, when it was just a dumb little accident I didn't mean to make. And that's all I've been telling her, that she has all the rights in the world to be annoyed or mad that I screwed up and was spacing out not paying attention, but I just want her to understand I didn't do it intentionally, and that I wasn't just 'tuning her out' and purposefully ignoring her. I have no reason to do that, I'm not mad or annoyed or anything, I was just distracted and didn't notice. So...AITA for failing to pay attention like that?

29,1cp3m6d,AITA for not adopting a dog,"In February my fiancé and I took a trip to Florida to visit his recently divorced brother. He had just gotten a new dog, a 9 mo. old blue heeler that he paid $900 for after the 2 cats he got for “emotional support” didn’t work out. We stayed for a weekend and saw his kids spray the dog with water, bang on its kennel when it was whining, hit it in the face when the dog rightfully tried to bite them. His brother even hit the dog. The dog was left outside all day and only let inside to eat before bed and would usually pee in the house and it only ate once a day right before bed. His brother is clearly not responsible or mature enough to own a dog (let alone children tbh). My fiancé asked me not to speak up about it because it was disrespectful to criticize him in his house about his dog. 

Anyways, a couple months later he’s on the phone talking about how fed up he is with the dog barking all the time. I say let’s offer to take it! So he tells his brother we’ll take the dog, brother then calls us two days later saying he wants us to have it but we’ll have to drive 12 hours to get it and pay him half of his money back but that he’ll comp us for gas. I am pissed at this point but I feel so terrible for the dog and I want to help so I say yes initially and we agree to it.

A week or two later I’m actually thinking it through. We have two dogs already in an 800 square foot apartment that only allows two dogs under 50 pounds each. We are already pushing it with our 80 pound Irish wolfhound. I do think it would be great for him to have a companion to play with as our blind chihuahua wants nothing to do with him. However, I believe we would be doing this dog a disservice having it stuck here until we save up for a down payment to buy a home. We don’t have the room or the time to give what it needs. Not to mention our chihuahua is already a medical expense. A yearly vet exam is about $500 per year and that’s for both dogs. The eye exams are $150 per 4-6 months. Their flea medication and food is expensive these days. Adding on another dog and taking care of it properly is going to be a huge extra expense. And my fiancé argues that we can afford it especially with his new job with such a big pay increase. He swears he will do all the work and take care of everything which I know will only last so long. 

We’re getting married in 3 weeks and plan to own a home. I’ve been upfront about want to be a SAHM for 1-2 years since we met. When I brought up that I don’t feel comfortable taking care of three dogs and at least one kid maybe two, despite saying that I feel uncomfortable he thinks it’s not a big deal &  I’m overthinking it.

I thought more and told him not to make a budget or list, that there was no way I could compromise on something this big. He thinks I’m not even hearing him out and that everything always has to be my way.
I’m feeling guilty about this because I want to help the dog but I can’t put our dogs or our housing at risk.",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-10,"AITA for not adopting a dog In February my fiancé and I took a trip to Florida to visit his recently divorced brother. He had just gotten a new dog, a 9 mo. old blue heeler that he paid $900 for after the 2 cats he got for “emotional support” didn’t work out. We stayed for a weekend and saw his kids spray the dog with water, bang on its kennel when it was whining, hit it in the face when the dog rightfully tried to bite them. His brother even hit the dog. The dog was left outside all day and only let inside to eat before bed and would usually pee in the house and it only ate once a day right before bed. His brother is clearly not responsible or mature enough to own a dog (let alone children tbh). My fiancé asked me not to speak up about it because it was disrespectful to criticize him in his house about his dog. 

Anyways, a couple months later he’s on the phone talking about how fed up he is with the dog barking all the time. I say let’s offer to take it! So he tells his brother we’ll take the dog, brother then calls us two days later saying he wants us to have it but we’ll have to drive 12 hours to get it and pay him half of his money back but that he’ll comp us for gas. I am pissed at this point but I feel so terrible for the dog and I want to help so I say yes initially and we agree to it.

30,1cp3df4,AITA for not giving my sister any of my money even though I am in a significantly better financial situation?,"My (26F) sister (32F) ""Bethy"" and I are both stay-at-home moms. I have 1F twins; she has three sons, 6M, 4M, and 2M.

My husband, Micheal, is a master plumber who makes excellent money; he owns his own business, and I couldn't be prouder of him. I used to be a librarian; I have my MLS and bachelor's in Education. During the birth of our girls, on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, we hit a speed bump, and I was injured. I am now an ambulatory wheelchair user and attend physical therapy, as I am learning to walk again. I hurt from my hips down, but my babies are worth it. We decided I would be a SAHM after my first surgery, and my husband gives me $3000/month to use how I want to, as ""payment for being such a good mom"" We are extraordinarily blessed financially, and I'm happy being able to see my girls growing up.

Bethy's husband, Jackson, is an elementary school teacher, but teaching doesn't pay much in our state. Bethy has been a SAHM for the entirety of her marriage and is used to having to scrimp and save for things.

She asked me out for coffee recently and I accepted. I was chatting with her when I mentioned that our girls would start baby swim classes soon. I was happy the pool was wheelchair accessible. Bethy started ranting about how expensive swimming lessons are and how she could never afford to put her boys in swimming. I said I was also excited about playgroup this week, as I had been nervous to go the first time we had gone because none of the other moms and dads in the group used mobility aids. When I mentioned the name of the playgroup I go to with my girls, Bethy became angry because it's one of the more expensive playgroups.

She was angry because ""I knew money was tight."" and ""I didn't even think to invite her and Jackson's son because then she wouldn't have to pay for daycare. She then asked if my husband gave me an allowance. She was a bit angry, and people were starting to stare, so I said yes and asked her to keep her voice down. She wondered how much it was, and I told her. She asked if I could give it to her, and I told her no because I like to treat myself after my physio appointments, and I want to save as much as possible for a rainy day fund.

Bethy said she and her husband have nothing but rainy days and left the restaurant without paying. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I'm not helping her when I know I could. Still, when I asked Micheal he said that my sister could get a job and reminded me that I became a SAHM because it was something we agreed we were financially stable enough to do as well as because of my mobility limitations.

31,1cp38bw,AITA for bringing an officer out to get my ps5 back?,"I (24 F) mistakenly rented a ps5 from a website. Basically, I thought I was paying for it over a year and I’d get to keep it. Turns out, I’d have to send it back at the end of the year. 45$/month. 

Initially I wanted to send it back, and I should have. My brother’s (25 M) fiancé (25 F) however had just lost her job, and with that the TV and ps5 they were paying on. I was persuaded to give the rented ps5 to him by my mother and his fiancé. I told him he could keep it as long as he pays the rent for it every month on time and give it back at the end of the rental period. He accepted. This started around Christmas last year. 

Every month (besides one) he has been late on paying it. And when he did, he was borrowing it from our parents or somebody else. He doesn’t have a steady income (he isn’t good at holding down a job) so I kinda expected that… It came to a head today when I asked him for the rent money because I’m completely broke from having to pay the rent for him. He said he doesn’t understand how my being broke is his fault, and thinks me asking for my money so I can get groceries is stupid. (I know 45$ can’t get me much, but it could at least get me something to get through.)

He said when he got the money, he’d let me know and to stop nagging him about it. I told him I’d stop if he gave me the playstation back. He then responded by saying “You won’t period when I block your number.” I told him he’s been late with the payments, that it’s due on the 5th and it’s consistently late every time. I never got a reply back via text. 

After that exchange, I decided I had enough. I didn’t feel safe going over there by myself and I didn’t have any friends that could go with me, so I got an officer to ride with me over to his house to pick up the ps5. He gave it back, but the entire time he was telling me he wasn’t in a good mood and that he never wanted anything to do with me again. My family was also perplexed as to why I had an officer over and kept asking me why I felt the need to have one present. 

I felt numb during the whole thing, and I keep combing over the situation in my head. I feel like I did something wrong and that I overreacted. AITA?

Some ppl forwarded my post to the officials to get them to reach out to me and told me to call the township admin mayor's office. I did those things and got a response from the mayor's office with apologies and a response from the officials I wanted to reach.

The official I wanted to reach started off the conversation yelling and screaming at me about posting and getting him bothered. (I removed the post after the call) To find out he and his secretary have been on vacation for 2 weeks and that's why they haven't responded.

I get that and everyone deserves vacation but a deadline to sign up for something (that is going to cost thousands of dollars) is coming due in 3 days and I needed to get the paperwork in and needed an appointment to do so.

she took the paperwork and of course had to complain about the post and informed me that other than the day of my post she had not received a call from me and my husband and that she was on vacation. saying that she hadn't gotten a complaint in all her years of working.

36,1cp1s6u,AITA for not reaching out to my godmother and for being jealous of my sister?,"A couple of months ago my, 19F, cousin threw a party and my godmother, 40F, was there. She barely spoke to me during this party and it really bothered me even though it shouldn't because it's nothing new. 
On my way to this party, I told my family about how she doesn't ever reach out to me unless it's to wish me a happy birthday and she never makes an effort to hang out with me and basically makes me feel like she doesn't really care about me. They told me I wasn't any better as I don't reach out to her either which is very true but, I'm my view, she's been like this since I was a little kid and she should've been the one trying to be around me at that age, no? So why am I going to make the effort and just always be the one texting her when she doesn't care about me enough to text me? They tell me I'm wrong. 
At the end of the party, my godmother came to me and told me to text her if I wanted to go have coffee with her someday and I still haven't texted her. I don't know what I would even say to this woman, I don't see her as my godmother or even as a cousin (which she is) so it would be very awkward for me to be in that situation.
I now have a godson, 4M, and he's the best kid but I'm scared that I'm going to end up like my godmother because I have no example of what it's like to have a present godmother. I don't want him to feel like I do and I've wonder plenty of times if maybe my cousin should've chosen someone else. 

Now, to where my sister, 15F, comes in. My sister's godmother is out aunt who is basically a second mother to us both. She's been around for as long as I can remember and she's just the best. My sister's relationship with her godfather isn't the best. He used to be a family friend (my mom had a cafe and he was always around because, small town) and he dated our older sister (P) but then they broke up and a lot of drama happened and he stopped coming around which lead to L not being around her godfather. But now, he's been talking to her and asking her to hang out with him and he even sat her down and told her that despite having a godson, she'll always be his little princess and that our family was not the reason for him not being around, he just got busy. 
Everything that my sister (L) comes home from hanging out with him, she tells me about it as we're super close and she's always happy about it and it makes me jealous which in turn makes me angry because i shouldn't be jealous. My little sister deserves the best in the world and it's not her fault that my godmother and I's relationship is not the best.

They told me I wasn't any better as I don't reach out to her either which is very true but, I'm my view, she's been like this since I was a little kid and she should've been the one trying to be around me at that age, no? So why am I going to make the effort and just always be the one texting her when she doesn't care about me enough to text me? They tell me I'm wrong. 
At the end of the party, my godmother came to me and told me to text her if I wanted to go have coffee with her someday and I still haven't texted her. I don't know what I would even say to this woman, I don't see her as my godmother or even as a cousin (which she is) so it would be very awkward for me to be in that situation.
I now have a godson, 4M, and he's the best kid but I'm scared that I'm going to end up like my godmother because I have no example of what it's like to have a present godmother. I don't want him to feel like I do and I've wonder plenty of times if maybe my cousin should've chosen someone else. 

Now, to where my sister, 15F, comes in. My sister's godmother is out aunt who is basically a second mother to us both. She's been around for as long as I can remember and she's just the best. My sister's relationship with her godfather isn't the best. He used to be a family friend (my mom had a cafe and he was always around because, small town) and he dated our older sister (P) but then they broke up and a lot of drama happened and he stopped coming around which lead to L not being around her godfather. But now, he's been talking to her and asking her to hang out with him and he even sat her down and told her that despite having a godson, she'll always be his little princess and that our family was not the reason for him not being around, he just got busy. 
Everything that my sister (L) comes home from hanging out with him, she tells me about it as we're super close and she's always happy about it and it makes me jealous which in turn makes me angry because i shouldn't be jealous. My little sister deserves the best in the world and it's not her fault that my godmother and I's relationship is not the best.

So now I'm wandering, AITA for not reaching out to my godmother and for being jealous of my sister?",1.0,0.066922627389431,0,0
37,1cp1kbo,AITA for telling my mom to talk to my dad herself?,"So, my dad (41M) recently got of jail, and he has been doing well pretty okay so far. He had contacted me through my cousin and we started writing digital letters to each other. My dad has been clean for almost a year and finally doing his 
due diligence. He’s even paying back the child support that he’s in debt to. When I (21F) told my mom (43F) this she started to ask me if I write him and if I had been calling him. She would ask this probably weekly I noticed, or every time we would be on a call. 

Now some background to their relationship. My dad was a huge asshole to her. Infidelity, stealing her car when she was pregnant with me, stealing her credit cards, crashing at her place when he was at his lowest even when they broke up. Just when I was 19 did she cut ties with him when he popped up again at her house (in a high state as well, not THC), and had to call the police on him so he could leave her property. 

Though now, since he has contact with me, being very remorseful, I’ve told my mom snippets of our conversations since she would ask. I told her that he asks if my mom still hates him, though she says no. However anytime my dad reminds me of the child support check and I tell her about it she gets in a frenzy, saying how much she hates him. 

Now with the current situation, she had called me asking me to tell my dad about Snowfall saying that my dad would love the show and it would resonate with him. I jokingly said that she could tell him. Though, she scrunched her face and said, “Why would I do that? Just tell him!” And I kept saying no. 

Mom said I was an huge asshole (I don’t know if it was jokingly but it’s hard to tell with my mother) for not telling him and insisting she does, and that I’m being “flip-floppy”

39,1cp1h8p,AITA for telling my roommate I don't want her ex to come over?,"I (19f) am in college and staying in a dorm with two other girls. They are both friends from high school, so I know them fairly well. One of them, Ella, is in a fwb situation with an ex. I didn't particularly like her ex, Sarah, due to past problems, like badmouthing my friends and me. She also did things to Ella like blocking her after arguments, speaking over her, and pushing her to separate from her mom because her mom didn't like Sarah. I did not want my dislike of Sarah to come in between me and Ella, so I didn't tell her how I felt. They spend every weekend at Sarah's college and Ella often goes there during the week too. This was ok with me at first, as it is her business, but then it started to affect our friendship as well. Ella would tell my roommate and I that she was going to visit Sarah for the day, and then she would spend the night and not let us know, which worried us both because we didn't know what had happened to her. She also started to cancel plans with us and give reasons like she had too much homework, but it turned out she wanted to see Sarah. This didn't really change, even after talking to her about it, which is frustrating to me, and it started to put a strain on our friendship.  
  
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, Ella came to me and asked what I would think about Sarah spending the night sometimes at our dorm. I wasn't sure what to say right away, so I asked if I could have some time to think about it. Later that day, she asked me again and I told her I would be uncomfortable with it. A couple hours later, Ella asked again, and this time I just told her no. She then asked if there was a reason for me saying no and I told her again that it would make me uncomfortable. I didn't want to cause tension by telling her I didn't like Sarah. Ella continued asking though, and eventually I just told her ""I do not like Sarah"". This made her angry, and we stopped talking about it.  
  
The next week we talked again. I told her I was not trying to separate them, and I would support her because she was my friend and I care about her, but I did not want Sarah to spend the night or be in our room while I was there. I explained to her that I am a private person, and I don't like people in my personal space (which she knows) and that is especially true when I don't trust them because of how they have acted in the past.

Long story short, My GF (23F) and my sister (25F) have never gotten along since the day they first met.

The real issues started when we flew in to visit my sister last year after her husband purchased a new home. The entire time we were there I could tell that my sister was not a fan of my GF and she made it obvious with snarky comments and faces behind her back. The sad part is my GF makes a big effort to try and get on my sister's good side but no matter what she does my sister always has something to complain about.

My sister found out she was pregnant in October 2023 and invited me around May 2024 to possibly see my nephew. I was very excited and immediately booked my GF and I a ticket to visit. Unfortunately, my sister caught wind my GF was coming and called me to tell me that she was not welcome at her house. When I asked her why, she said it was because my GF didn't know when to stop talking and that she was loud and obnoxious (she is not)

THAT'S IT.

I told her I wouldn't ever be visiting unless my GF could accompany me.

This led to her yelling at me over the phone and calling my parents to complain. That night, my parents invited me alone to dinner and told me I would be cut off completely if I didn't come to see my nephew.

Long story short, My GF (23F) and my sister (25F) have never gotten along since the day they first met.

The real issues started when we flew in to visit my sister last year after her husband purchased a new home. The entire time we were there I could tell that my sister was not a fan of my GF and she made it obvious with snarky comments and faces behind her back. The sad part is my GF makes a big effort to try and get on my sister's good side but no matter what she does my sister always has something to complain about.

My sister found out she was pregnant in October 2023 and invited me around May 2024 to possibly see my nephew. I was very excited and immediately booked my GF and I a ticket to visit. Unfortunately, my sister caught wind my GF was coming and called me to tell me that she was not welcome at her house. When I asked her why, she said it was because my GF didn't know when to stop talking and that she was loud and obnoxious (she is not)

THAT'S IT.

I told her I wouldn't ever be visiting unless my GF could accompany me.

This led to her yelling at me over the phone and calling my parents to complain. That night, my parents invited me alone to dinner and told me I would be cut off completely if I didn't come to see my nephew. I relayed this message to my GF, and now she wants me to go alone and avoid this entire conflict. She also stated she never wants to visit my sister ever again if that's how she feels about her.

47,1cozxop,AITA for telling my dad I do not want to spend Mother’s Day with him,"On Mother’s Day 2023, my beautiful, supportive, nurturing mother passed away from a cardiac arrest in her sleep. It was the worst day of my (f 27) life and my brothers (m 33, m38) and my dad (m 60). It was sudden and extremely unexpected as she was very healthy. 
Since my mother’s passing, I being the only girl, have taken on much emotional labor for these 3 men. I expected it and I was somewhat even honored at times to be able to help them. 
My dad is a very traditional man. He was always the breadwinner, the provider. While my mother took on the empathetic duties in their parent ship. Empathy is not and never has been my father’s strong suit. 
My father is very wealthy. He boasts about his wealth to my brothers and I, to his own father and siblings, and really anyone who will listen. He came from nothing, put himself through law school and has decidedly earned every penny he has. But he is very stingy. He will govern money to us when we need it, but always with many terms and conditions and always with a very strict plan for repayment. I’m not saying this is wrong, it’s his money he must decide how to use it, but this transactional relationship does cause strain between us. 
Since my mother’s passing I have put my own style of grieving on the back burner many times in favor of doing what my dad wants. Thanksgiving, Christmas, even my own birthday it’s been about him and his grief. I have told him aloud and in texts that I do not share his style of grieving and prefer to be alone with my pain but he so desperately wishes for us to be together as a family that I always give in. 
With the approach of the anniversary of her death and the holiday of Mother’s Day itself, I told him that I was standing firm in not spending the day with him and my brothers. I do not wish to visit the cemetery. I do not wish to cry with them. I wish to spend my day my way by myself. When I told him this he was very offended, accused me of not wishing to honor or celebrate my mother and said that he has supported my constantly over the last year (with money) so it’s extremely unfair for me to not to be with him on this day. I told him I would think about it but I am sick to my stomach over this and feel as though I am grieving the loss of two parents. I can go to a bank for money but I can never get the love and support of my mom and dad anywhere else. Should I just go to the cemetery to appease him and keep the peace? Am I being an asshole by asserting myself and my wants on this day when all of us are in so much pain? I will take any advice at this point, I’m so lost.

49,1cozu1r,AITA for ignoring my friend because she was a downer at my bachelorette?,"I (31F) just got back from my bachelorette. She’s had some stressful financial issues. I did not expect her to come to my bachelorette since it was abroad and expensive. I invited her and as expected she declined which was fine! Her partner is one of my fiancé’s groomsman and insisted that he is going to his bachelor. She changed her mind and asked to join mine which seemed like “if you can then so can I” but either way I was happy she could join! 

Two months before the trip she fractured her ankle. I was concerned because the activities we planned involved a lot of walking. Given her injury and the cost, it was completely understandable if she wanted to sit out. She decided to come anyway and participate in the activities. 

The first night the girls tell me I can pick my room first. This place had multiple uniquely themed rooms! She immediately claims what was arguably the BEST room. It was Mario Kart themed kart beds (I’m a BIG nerd). I make a comment about getting first pick but she said her bags are in there already and too bad. Not a big deal I will be in my room to sleep so I pick another room but it bugged me. 

We played games for the evening and picked teams at random. I end up on her team + my Maid of honor. I am genuinely happy with the team! I’m ready to have fun playing nerdy beer Olympic games. She gave zero energy. No drink in hand, which is fine, but she would slowly get up, play, sit back on the couch, be on her phone, no smiling, it sucked. The other teams were making chants, cheering, and it felt like the Bride team at my own bachelorette was the worst. The vibes were getting to me more than I wanted them to. My MoH eventually takes her phone out of her hand and tells her to be present or not play lol. 

I end up asking if she’s alright, that it seems like she doesn’t want to be here or is her ankle hurting? She says it hurts a little so I told her not to push herself sit out the next round but she continued. I check in again, suggest that maybe she could be the score keeper, she still seems very uncomfortable. She again said no all good which was frustrating because at this point I’m being hyper-aware of the bad vibes.

It sucked being at my bachelorette night one and my direct surrounding was pulling me down. She made NO effort to socialize over the weekend, did not offer to help prep or cleanup. I genuinely don’t think she wanted to be there, it was a financial stress, it involved uncomfortable activities, being surrounded by girls she doesn’t know very well, all completely understandable! But the point is she CHOSE to come and to participate despite multiple outs.

On to the story, I was hired on as the junior high coach because the head and assistant position were already filled. I am the head cross country coach so I have a few athletes I’ve worked with in the fall in track. With that being said, they’re comfortable with me and have seen my training work well for them with very substantial results. 

I asked the head coach if it would be fine to work with varsity kids who asked me for help just as a courtesy. He said it was fine and didn’t have a problem. After a while he seemed to have an issue with it along the way. He’s typically only working with the throwers or on his phone across the track. Many of the kids have said he doesn’t help them or doesn’t know what he’s talking about (this is what they tell me). I use my connections to also get further coaching and tips from coaches who specialize in those events.

He has not addressed the “serious repercussions” thing to me, I’ve heard from the kids and athletes I work with from XC.

At one point in working with a kid on triple jump, the head coach came over to me and said what I was doing (coaching the kid) was a slap in the face to the other assistant.

I was only more than happy to help. I gave her a lot of money & asked her to live in my house. Rent-free, free food, and she could live there permanently.

I also gave her additional money every month.

She got a good job later & moved out, although I'd said she could continue staying there permanently.

A year after that, I fell into trouble. I was homeless. I asked Sandra for help. Not only did she say I am unwelcome to stay at her house as it would be a burden, she also refused to give me any money.

I now have a good job as earlier. Sandra's now having her wedding & invited me. All of us congratulated her, except me. I said I am not attending.

She got mad. I said that I do not want to be with anyone who's as ungrateful. She began to yell at me, and others agree with her in that I am in the wrong since I'd said that she does not have to return the money when I'd helped her.

55,1coyq9d,AITA for fighting with my BF 3 times this week because he hasn’t been pulling his weight around the apto?,"I (30 female) have been dating my Boyfriend (29 male) for 10 months. After 2 months he came to my place to spend the night and we’ve been living together ever since! He still has his own place, but his lease is coming up…a few months ago a pipe bursted at his place and, according to him, kind of destroyed a lot of his things so he threw his blankets a pillows out and things like that…but since he has been staying here that really wasn’t a problem. 
For the 8 months he has been here he hasn’t helped me pay for a single bill and for around 6 months I was the only one paying for food…in the beginning I didn’t mind because he was at leave from work because of a medical problem he had related to his chronic illness. 
But once he got back to work I started asking him to share the groceries…he said he would gladly give me any money I needed I just had to ask…so I did…every week I calculated what he owed me and told him so he could transfer the money…but he never did it right away and it took me reminding him for days until I was firmer about it. 
Another thing is that in the beginning, when he wasn’t working, he used to help cleaning the house, doing dishes and laundry…which really took a load off of me having someone to share the work. But ever since he got back to work around 4/5 months ago he hasn’t been doing much at all! To the point that the house is a mess and the pile of laundry and dishes piled super high! I had a hard time cleaning for 2 people and keeping everything in order! Once every…I don’t know…month or two I would bring it up and it would start a fight in which he would end up agreeing with me and started helping more. But for the past month things have gotten worse…he makes me dinner from time to time…easy things like sandwiches and frying a steak or something…but nothing else! 
A week ago he was transferred at work to work nights from 4:30 pm to 1:00 am…and I get it! Working nights is hard! But he has been going to bed more or less the same time he used to (around 3) but he has been sleeping more (until 11 or 12). Monday we had a fight about the mess and him not helping….Wednesday same thing and today again! 
At the moment i feel I lot of pressure from work as I failed a licensing exam and will be retaking it next Friday…
He is pissed off that I keep fighting with him..he says he is tired of it and that it’s been only a week since he started working nights…and that he hasn’t been eating (even though I always make sure to have leftovers for him to take to work…he just doesn’t) and now he doesn’t sleep because I fight with him and it will make him have an episode of his chronic disease because of it! But he cleaned a bit today while/after the fight…just superficial stuff…throwing out the trash, taking the dishes off of the machine. And it’s always like that..he only does something when I’m angry…

Some bg, my mom and my dad had an arranged marriage, they had me around 4? 5? years later, mainly because my dad wanted to be more financially stable for a kid (thats what he says)

Now here's the problem, my dad is insanely money conscious, the change from a horrible 500usd (only tuition) per year school to 1000usd school made him so mad he only allowed me to buy cheaper pads that gave me horrible rashes. 

He considers clothes to be a luxury so I have three tshirt and two pants, I have a 100$ phone who's speakers don't work and a laptop that's 10 years old. See I'm fine with what I have, it was all i used to be able to have for a long time but now that we're not squandering for money is it really fair that I still have to give up my dreams for a masters because he refuses to spend money on that? (im 17, he doesnt really want me to pursue a bachelors either, just start a 9-5 w no degree required)

Ik that budgeting is necessary but my father is a very, very rich like if he retired right now it would be easy for him to live comfortable for another 70 years no costs cut, and i'd understand if we spend alot, but we.. dont?? My father refuses to compromise, on anything, its to the point where he gives my mom a 600$ budget to keep the house running, plus the luxuries (btw this also includes fucking stationary and groceries). Everytime my mom brings up how he's not giving us enough he starts to list how much we spend on electricity property tax etc etc and how we're spending like around 14kusd on taxes and non-workable spendings ig. all of what i've mentioned comes to around at the msot 30percent of his yearly earnings, the rest go to him, his macbook, iphone and even the latest fucking ipad. Im pretty sure he spends on himself the amount we spend yearly.

 He refuses to think critically and looks for quick ways to save cash, the only ones suffering are people who aren't him so I got mad when he said he wanted to take off our ac's and coolers. The temperatures reach 42-43 here and our homes are not built to accomadate that. He'd allow only one hr per day anyway but lord he says he wants us to stop using the fans for an hour too now?

58,1coy2vt,AITA for not being able to take a phone call or specify an exact time that I could?,"I asked for advice in a fb group, specifically for giving advice. The admin responded, quite abruptly, but with good advice. I thanked them and t​ried their suggestion and reached out for clarification the following day, in the original thread/post, as I was still struggling. The original post was quite long but the subsequent messages were a sentence or 2. I wasn't writing essays for this person to read and respond to repeatedly, I didn't nag or hound for a reply, I just asked a follow up question.

They asked me to pm; which I did, and they tried to call me later but I wasn't able to take it so messaged to apologise as I didn't realise they intended to call and I wasn't able to talk now. I thought they wanted to pm because they wanted to ask private info or something. They gave no indication that was their intention and it didn't even cross my mind that a stranger on the internet would take the time to make a phone call to help me.

They asked my availability. I thanked them again for going the extra mile, but explained I was busy over the weekend (I have a lot of things going on but don't know specifically when they are happening so can't say I'm free at x time and then I'm actually not) but I could try and get somewhere to talk if they messaged first aka I would work around a time that suited them, or I could be free anytime Monday after a work meeting first thing.

They abruptly withdrew assistance, basically said if I didn't care, they didn't care. They then posted essentially the same thing as a reply to my thread in the group. Nobody else has responded but they definitely won't now because I look like an AH with no context if they read the public comments.

Whilst I massively appreciate their time and effort, I think it's rude AF, in this day and age, to just call someone with no notice or prior arrangement. I work full time (and some), have bad reception and my phone randomly cuts out/cuts volume. I can't always have private conversations on the spot or find somewhere appropriate to do so.

I'm obviously not entitled to anybody's time/advice. If they changed their mind about helping me, that's fine, but they didn't need to be rude about it.

So AITA for not being available/suggesting I work around their schedule if they gave me some notice? Or were they the AH for being a dick about the fact I wasn't free, calling out of the blue and publicly criticising me without context?

I know I probably could have taken the call in the time it's taken to write this out but it's 8.30 at night, I'm still supposed to be working and I'm so (probably unreasonably) annoyed about this persons attitude I literally can't concentrate to do any work so I had to get it out...",Not the A-hole,2024-05-10,"AITA for not being able to take a phone call or specify an exact time that I could?

59,1coxv5j,AITA for not going home for my sister's birthday because it's during coursework season?,"Hello, I am a uni student from the UK and it is currently May, which is when exams take place and coursework is due. Every year my sister has made a big deal about me coming home for her birthday, which is on the 18th. My uni is about 3 hours away from my parents' house and while I know this is nothing to some, for the UK that is quite far.

This year I tried to tackle the issue early, letting my parents know months ago I was not going to be coming home for my sister's birthday as it is my final year and I do not want the stress of having this argument while I'm trying to get my coursework done in May. It's been brought up again over the months and every time I have maintained that I will not be coming.

My sister is turning 21 this year and is making a bigger fuss about it than usual. She claims that I do not have my priorities straight and that this is really important to her but I am 'not making the effort' to be there for it. My parents have offered to pay for my trains but I would need to go on 18th and come back the 19th, and one of my pieces of coursework is due on the 22nd. I don't have a laptop that I can bring with me to do any work with but I keep being told that it is 'only one night'. Neither of my parents went to uni so they don't see my point of view and are both on her side, claiming that I have known she wanted me home for months and that I could have put in the effort to complete all the coursework before her birthday and then come home, but any uni student I have spoken to about this has told me that I would be crazy to go home in the middle of exam season. My last lecture for this particular piece of coursework was 2 days ago, but my parents seem to be under the impression that the coursework is set at the beginning of the semester and I could simply complete it and hand it in whenever I want, but I choose to leave it until the last minute. Admittedly I do have a history of doing exactly that all throughout senior school and sixth form so I can see on a level why they see it that way but no amount of explaining seems to change their point of view at all.

Anyway, as I was afraid it might, this issue has come up again now because her birthday is only a week away, they are all guilt tripping me and shaming me for not coming home and my sister has essentially just told me that we are done if I don't come home. I'm not sure if she means it or if she is just being as dramatic as possible to get her way, (she has been incredibly spoiled and selfish her whole life and always manages to get her own way but I won't go into that), but the way my family are reacting it's very stressful and upsetting for me and I do start to wonder if I'm the bad guy.

I had been in onboarding and training for this position for a month, and updating my mother frequently about what I'm doing.

I asked her how she knows he didn’t give the card to anyone else or wasn’t in the process of doing so and she gets pissed off at me and says she is upset and I am taking someone else’s side then hangs up the phone (common practice). I called back to clarify what I did wrong and she says I always say things to make her feel like I am so smart and she is the stupid one. I told her I never called her stupid and repeated exactly what happened to remind her that I was just asking a logical question about what the other person might have done. 

From my side, I am trying to help her see that it might not have been personal but maybe he just wanted to help people understand how to say his name. 

Now I am questioning whether I should have just listened and said yes you are right or not said anything at all. I hate questioning myself but I am also open to feedback and when I ask her for it, I get blamed or put down in some way.

I have three pets but two are considered pets in my landlords eyes and on the lease only two pets are allowed. I have a lizard, a bunny, and a small sized dog. Jenna knew this before moving in with me and never had a issue with it up until her girlfriend moved in.

It's became clear that Stacy wants me to get rid of either my bunny or my dog so that she could move her childhood cat (17 years old) in with us. Apparently her cat is staying with a family member who is threatening to get rid of the cat if Stacy doesn't take the cat. I've told them no and that Stacy needs to find other arrangements because no way in hell am i getting rid of my bunny or dog. Jenna was genuinely pissed and called me selfish. 

She said it was unfair how i was the only one who had pets and was taking up the pet limit. which was funny because Jenna genuinely had zero issue with it and if she felt that way then she should've literally never moved in with me. She knew i had three pets before she moved in. I told them both i didn't give a damn. I don't like cats and i don't like nor know Stacy so why exactly would or should i get rid of my pets for her. 

They said that they could just hide the cat but I said i would speak to the landlord if they did. I've seen too many people get evicted because their roommate broke the lease contract. Not just that but this is a 17 year old cat who will be moving to a different place with three different animals. Animals they've likely never interacted with In their life.

64,1coxby0,AITA For moving with my kids because of my ex's legal trouble,"My ex-gf, Jen (34F), and I (35M) have 2 kids together (8 & 6). We never married and broke up about 3 years ago. We had court-ordered split custody and for the most part co-parented well together. Things were going pretty well until last year Jen was charged with felony financial fraud. Earlier this year she was convicted and sentenced to 24-30 months in prison. With good behavior she will probably be out in about 18-months.

When we found out she was pregnant with our second child, she pushed me to move closer to her family so that she be closer to her support system. I agreed despite my concerns about having to find a new job and the COL being higher, but we made it work. I have a good job here, but I'm lonely and stressed with the 2 kids.

Before Jen's trial I had petitioned the court for full custody and it was granted. Jen's family helps when they can but they aren't my favorite people and we don't always get along well. After some conversations with my family, I decided to move closer to them to try and get a fresh start. I will be moving about 1,200 miles from where we currently live. I informed Jen about this the last time I took the kids to visit her. She was not happy and had some choice words for me.

Her family is also tearing into me about this. They are threatening to sue for grandparent's rights (which aren't really a thing in this state). They are also accusing me of parental alienation for taking the kids away from their mother. They are convinced that Jen will be out in 18-months and that isn't too long in the grand scheme of things and isn't worth taking the kids away. Especially since after Jen gets out she will have restrictions on travel that will make it harder for her to see the kids.

I do feel a little conflicted about it, but I know I am doing the best thing for me with this decision. I also believe it will be better for the kids to go to a school where other kids don't know their mom is in prison. I have cleared all of this with my lawyer and he assured me that I am doing everything by the book and that since I have full custody and Jen is currently incarcerated, she has no legal standing to try and stop me. He also said that the grandparent's rights thing has about a 1% chance of even getting in front of a judge.

I have had to threaten Jen's parents with cutting them off if they don't stop pressuring me to stay. The whole situation is a mess and my poor kids are stuck in the middle. I am trying to do the best thing for them in the long run even if the short-term is going to be hard.

65,1cox16o,AITA for having a “no sauce in my moving car” rule?,"So there are 2 prior incidents in which people have spilled various things in my car.  One was BBQ sauce and the other was an open container of ranch.  Different incidents, different car, but it stained my seat and my floor.

As such, I have a rule of no open containers of sauce in my car.

This became an issue last week when my boyfriend and I were on our way home from somewhere and he asked if I could swing by Sonic so he could get something.  No problem, we go, he gets his food.

Sonic is about 10 minutes from our house.  He opens his food and goes to open his marinara sauce to dip his mozzarella sticks.  I told him no, he can’t open the sauce in my car.  He asks why, and I tell him about the ranch and the bbq sauce.  He says he won’t spill.  I said that my prior two passengers said the same thing.  No sauce in the car.  Eating in the car is fine but nothing spillable that I can’t get up with a vacuum.

He got mad and said my rules are archaic and stupid.  I said he’s entitled to that opinion, but there’s still no sauce allowed in my car, he needs to wait till we get home.

Here’s where I may be the AH: He complained that his sticks were going to be cold by the time, so I told him idgaf if they’re cold he could warm them up in the microwave, and to just be an adult and learn some patience and wait 10 goddamn minutes if he has to have his sauce so bad.

I do think she's smarter than me, but I persevere more and was accepted to more opportunities. I think my persistence for these endeavours has made me competitive and toxic. I love her and am so happy we met: she's a genuine person and we have a lot to talk about.

Due to her engagement with one part of uni services, she was recommended to go on a fully-funded trip to Frankfurt, where she'll participate in uni related courses. She was so happy to be selected, understandably! I was told about this the day after she found out, with some trepidation (I now know she's thought me competitive, and even felt miserable when she was invited to another scheme and I told her I hadn't been). I was jealous, since I had no holiday plans during the time. I thought hard about the ethics but considered how cool it would be if we could both go abroad. Later I asked her for the coordinator's email address. Hearing this, she immediately asked me if I would ask to join.

She was right. I sent the coordinator an email detailing my involvement with the same services (but not quite in the same way as she had), to show why I am a highly-engaged student, and should go to Frankfurt as well. Coordinator accepted this and put me on the reserve list. When prompted, my friend told me she got a place. Today, I got a place as well.

I told her this, and she accepted it. Then I asked her what she really thought. She said that she wanted to withhold the Frankfurt information, as she was annoyed that earlier I had been accepted to a course-related trip to India when she hadn't (I dropped out of that, but only applied to see if my grades were good enough to go, and they were!) and felt that I told her too quickly that she wasn't on the India trip mailing list. I apologised for my behaviour for then and for unknowingly making her feel bad during the earlier scheme.

She also talked about feeling academically behind to our mutual friends. When she told them about Frankfurt, they bought her cake to congratulate. I now feel awkward about telling our friends that I will be going with her too, as I think she told them about how competitive I can be on these occasions. I doubt they will be as happy for me.

I'm (30F) married to (let's call him Zac) Zac (32M). We've been happily married for over 3 years now and have a beautiful son. Zac is a kind of a person who is open to criticize people in the name of 'honesty' but lacks enough strength to accept one from others. 

We've known eachother from childhood - were far-off related to each other but have mutual relatives.

I'll give a back story before getting into the exact situation. TL DR -  he has a massive fight with his elder sister and had a fallout (she lives in the same town as us; theyre the only children to my in-laws). Every since, he gets sensitive everytime our son goes to her place. Recently, i was invited to her place but I declined citing my hectic work schedule. But, lowkey, i wanted to take my husband's side. 

Though I didn't not mention the explicit reason, I think he understood my reluctance to visit her sisters place.

Now, I've been invited to go out with my maternal family for a short pilgrim trip. My maternal grandmother (not the immediate) had called over the phone, invited us to come with them. She spoke to my in-laws too as I said ealier, we're mutually related.

Now, my husband is insisting that I shouldnt be going to the trip because they didn't call him up to invite. He said that the cousins at least should've called! But, it's the granny's plan and even those cousins havent called me either.

69,1cowllk,AITA for expecting a Mother’s Day gift?,"Hello all! I (30F) and my husband (32M) have been together for almost 12 years. We have 4 kids together, all under 12 years old. He recently just told me that he wasn’t getting me a Mother’s Day gift this year. When I asked why his response was “When have I had time to go shopping?” To make it clear, he works 5 days a week and is gone for 13-14 hours those days. He leaves at 6am and isn’t home until 9pm or later. On the days he is home, I’m home as well so I can see how that can cause issue. When I brought up all of the online options, he just said that he doesn’t like shopping online. He didn’t get me a Christmas present either (for like the past 3 years actually), for the same reason. He hates receiving gifts, but I love to give and receive gifts. We have had many talks about this, I’m a big communicator and make my feelings known so that resentment doesn’t build. I don’t know if I just need to let this go? I find it hard to not feel upset when I give him gifts, while I know he doesn’t want to receive anything as a “gift” I always get him things he wants and will use, and he shows no gratitude. I don’t know if it comes down to money being an issue either. He is the only one working while I’m finishing up medical school.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-10,"AITA for expecting a Mother’s Day gift? Hello all! I (30F) and my husband (32M) have been together for almost 12 years. We have 4 kids together, all under 12 years old. He recently just told me that he wasn’t getting me a Mother’s Day gift this year. When I asked why his response was “When have I had time to go shopping?” To make it clear, he works 5 days a week and is gone for 13-14 hours those days. He leaves at 6am and isn’t home until 9pm or later. On the days he is home, I’m home as well so I can see how that can cause issue. When I brought up all of the online options, he just said that he doesn’t like shopping online. He didn’t get me a Christmas present either (for like the past 3 years actually), for the same reason. He hates receiving gifts, but I love to give and receive gifts. We have had many talks about this, I’m a big communicator and make my feelings known so that resentment doesn’t build. I don’t know if I just need to let this go? I find it hard to not feel upset when I give him gifts, while I know he doesn’t want to receive anything as a “gift” I always get him things he wants and will use, and he shows no gratitude. I don’t know if it comes down to money being an issue either. He is the only one working while I’m finishing up medical school.

71,1cow5cv,WIBTA for wanting to move forward?,"I (25F) is in a relationship with my boyfriend (31M). I have a young daughter from a previous relationship. Our relationship has been long distance so far and we've been on steady for nearly one and half years now. I made the plan to relocate and will be next month to my boyfriend's country. So, when I gave him the news that everything is set, he didn't seem rather excited but it seemed like just another piece of news. He knows that I have never set foot in that country and how difficult it can be to relocate, especially with a child in tow. So, he only said, "" I guess now you have many things to do, like finding a house"". I didn't expect for him to be of any help as this is on me but it hurts to know that he isn't offering any help of any kind, like helping me find housing. I have found a house so far, but it far out in a village, on Airbnb. I feel that if I pull this off entirely on my own, I will have no other reason to be with him. I don't ask him for anything in fact and sometimes he could even go for three days to a week without talking, not even a single message. The longest we have gone without a call is a month. I occasionally call but he mostly never picks.



The dilemma is in this; he came to visit and we had a very lovely one month together. He seems like a very different person when he is visiting me or we are together in person but then communication lacks strongly when he is back home. He doesn't have a crazy schedule and even if he did, a hi message doesn't take any longer than 5 seconds to type. Am I possibly overreacting?

72,1cow3os,AITA for leaving dinner because my sister was late… again? ,"I (27F) had plans to go out to dinner with my sister (30F) as we do every month. She lives in my hometown and I live in the next state over with my BF, we’re about 35 mins to an hour apart depending on traffic. We agreed to meet closer to hometown with my mom. 

One thing about her, she is always late. I expect she’ll always be at least 30 mins late but it’s been up to a few hours. And not just random plans, weddings and graduations too. It’s been brought up in the past by mom and I but she always brushes it off and gets upset.

My BF drove me over, I can’t drive and he offered to drop me before he had to head out for plans of his own near home and come back when he was done. I assumed after dinner we would just hang out at her house either way.

Get to the place and start calling my sister (she usually doesn’t say if she’s gonna be late, but if my mom is with her she does, and I hadn’t heard anything). I get mom a few mins later and she says they’re behind because it took awhile to get my nephew who’s almost 1 ready and my sister got in the shower later than expected. I didn’t even know my nephew was coming and she usually tells me if he is. Her husband was apparently there to let mom in when she showed up but went back to sleep as soon as she got there. Not sure why he couldn’t help get baby ready, but that’s none of my business.

I check Maps and it says 35 mins, adding in getting  baby strapped and secure and then putting him in either the stroller or front carrier on her body, I was looking at 40 mins. To top it off we had reservations (SHE made the reservation, not me). I had never been to this place and didn’t know if it was one of those places that don’t let you have the table if your whole group isn’t there. There was really no space to wait inside and I’d have to stand outside. Anyway I didn’t feel like sitting alone for 40 mins even if I could. 

She doesn’t keep her friends waiting this long when they make plans, I don’t get why it’s okay to do this to me and mom. I’m speaking to mom as they’re trying to change the reservation online, at that point I was fed up. If we agree to be there at a certain time be there. 5 or 10 mins late is fine but not this. I told mom I was going back home, I didn’t feel like fuming at the table and acting like I wasn’t mad when they got there (as I’d done before). She sounded hurt and mad but said fine and that she would go home too. 

Since then I haven’t spoken to my sister (it’s been a few weeks) and mom doesn’t want to get in the middle, but I told her I wasn’t speaking to her until I get an apology. Mom told her she can’t keep doing this on their ride back home and agrees it’s an issue, but won’t say much else. It’s ridiculous to just always be late because you’re bad at time management. She also wants to use the “it takes long to get a baby ready” excuse which I would accept if it wasn’t for the fact that this has been a problem long before my nephew was born or even a thought.

We are stuck in a lease for multiple more months, and I am currently crashing on the couch till it’s over. We pretty much dont speak, unless he is trying to mess with me.

Recently, he told me that he would start bringing over women to the apartment when he wanted, and would give me a bit of a warning. I got very upset tbh, and I told him that I thought it was inconsiderate and a major asshole move to do that, considering I don’t have privacy, nor do I drive due to medical reasons.

He flipped out saying he will do what he wants, and that im not allowed to have anyone over under any circumstances.
I even tried asking if he could go to the other persons place, and he said he didn’t want to.

At this point im just trying to wait it out with the lease, and I don’t really have many friends in my area, and no family within 3000+ miles, and I feel like im going insane at this point:(

77,1cov5to,"AITA for not wanting to forgive my ""best friend""?","I (18f) got into an argument with my bsf Lila (18f).

It all started when she started scribbling on my book. She always does this because she knows i like my things to be perfect. I usually say and do nothing, because ig it would make me a better person if i just ignore and forget about it, but this week has been stressful so i politely asked her to stop. She started insulting me, calling me names like ""dork"", slurs and n word (we're both white). I know that she was joking, she always jokes like this but not only do i get fed up with this namecalling, sometimes i actually get offended.

Before you say ""oh it's just what bsfs do"" , yeah i know that. But that's not what I consider a friendship, a real friend not do that to me. I got upset about this a few month ago too, and mentioned it to her. She stopped but eventually started doing it again.

I really did not want to argue so i bit my tongue and moved seats to another one of my close friends Ivy (18f). She noticed that we were arguing and asked both of us what happened and Lila said ""I really don't know what i did but i clearly upset her."". There was no way she didn't know the reason why so i just straight up mentioned things that she has been saying and ruining my books/notebooks with her drawings and scribbles. Instead of apologizing she said ""Wow the OCD is crazyy.. Are you gonna cry now?"". I felt like i was being bullied.

After that class she tried to apologize offering me money and badges (that i collect). She had to sit next to special-ed student and was probably looking for a way to get out of that situation. She tried to use a cheap apology so she could save herself so I just ignored her.

""The ghosting is crazy"", ""I don't want a friend that is a h03 anyway"" she said. I have barely told anyone that we are fighting, let alone call her names like that.

I really don't get it how she sees herself as a victim in this situation.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-10,"AITA for not wanting to forgive my ""best friend""? I (18f) got into an argument with my bsf Lila (18f).

It all started when she started scribbling on my book. She always does this because she knows i like my things to be perfect. I usually say and do nothing, because ig it would make me a better person if i just ignore and forget about it, but this week has been stressful so i politely asked her to stop. She started insulting me, calling me names like ""dork"", slurs and n word (we're both white). I know that she was joking, she always jokes like this but not only do i get fed up with this namecalling, sometimes i actually get offended.

Before you say ""oh it's just what bsfs do"" , yeah i know that. But that's not what I consider a friendship, a real friend not do that to me. I got upset about this a few month ago too, and mentioned it to her. She stopped but eventually started doing it again.

I really did not want to argue so i bit my tongue and moved seats to another one of my close friends Ivy (18f). She noticed that we were arguing and asked both of us what happened and Lila said ""I really don't know what i did but i clearly upset her."". There was no way she didn't know the reason why so i just straight up mentioned things that she has been saying and ruining my books/notebooks with her drawings and scribbles. Instead of apologizing she said ""Wow the OCD is crazyy.. Are you gonna cry now?"". I felt like i was being bullied.

After that class she tried to apologize offering me money and badges (that i collect). She had to sit next to special-ed student and was probably looking for a way to get out of that situation. She tried to use a cheap apology so she could save herself so I just ignored her.

78,1couukq,"AITA for making my parents replace my ""toys"" they decided to give away.","I'm moving to another city for work. Since I'm an adult and not a college kid I hired movers. 

My parents insisted on coming down to help me pack up. I live in their basement suite. It was cheap and they let me have my privacy. They brought my brother and my nephew. The four of them were as helpful as a bag of used horse condoms. Especially my nephew. 

My parents decided to keep him busy by giving him one of my Lego sets to play with. I collect them. What I usually do is buy two of the same one. I build one, put it up for display and leave the other one in the box to trade or sell. 

He took it upstairs to stay out of the way then he took it home. All I noticed is that he was out from under foot. 

The next day I saw the box on the garbage. I didn't assume. I knew the answer already but I didn't assume. I went upstairs to talk to them. I asked where the Lego box came from. They said they gave it to Travis to keep him busy. I told them that they needed to replace it. They said I was being childish for caring so much about a toy. I said they could replace it or I would file an insurance claim and that would probably require a police report. 

My dad got angry. He pulled out $70 and told me I was an asshole for making a fuss over a toy. I asked him if that was a down payment? He said that is what he spent on the last Lego gift he got me for Christmas and that is what those helmets cost. 

I showed him the box. I told him to keep his money. He just had to give me a sealed box like the one he stole. 

He said he didn't steal anything. He took the box and went to the Lego store nearby. 

When he came back he was apologetic. He said he would get it back from my nephew. I said I wanted a sealed box with the Tie Fighter helmet. I even went on eBay to help him find one cheaper than he had found by himself at the collectibles store the guy at the Lego store sent him to. With shipping it would only be $300. He ordered it. He isn't happy about it. 

My mom is upset that I'm expecting that much money for a toy. My dad is upset that I didn't explain before he went and made a fool of himself at the store. I'm upset that they stole from me.

79,1cous71,AITA for getting annoyed by my boyfriend smoking weed inside? ,"Hi! My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. We have been living together for 6 months (in a SMALL apartment). We live in a country in Europe where weed is not legalised at all and you can get punished for having weed on you. 

So, my boyfriend has been open about him smoking weed all the time, and I've been okay with it. When I moved into his place I found out that he smokes more than I thought (maybe 5 times after work, not sure how much the amount is each time). He smokes under the fan in the kitchen, never goes outside. It hasn't bothered me too much until now. 

Lately, he's been smoking something that smells A LOT (which he loves and thinks is better than what he used to use). The entire apartment smells like weed (only when he smokes though, and a while after) to the point where I sometimes get a bit nauseous. 

I have tried talking to him about it, but he seems annoyed that I suddenly now have a problem with his use. I have tried telling him that what he smokes now smells a lot and that I don't like it. I moved into his place, but this is also my home now and I want to be comfortable here. I work in the medical field and also travel sometimes internationally, and I'm getting nervous that my clothes smell (we have a SMALL apartment together so the smell goes everywhere). I'm scared friends and family smells it when they visit. I feel like my hair smells... Maybe I'm paranoid, I don't know.

So today I tried suggesting he goes outside, but he got annoyed. We don't have a balcony either, so he would have to walk downstairs to get outside the apartment complex. He basically answered me ""okay, I guess I'll just have to sit outside in the park all evening then"". And when I explained my discomfort further he just said he ""doesn't know"" how to fix it. 

I get that I moved into HIS place and he was open about him smoking weed before - but this is also my home now, and I want to be comfortable. The smell and usage has increased.

80,1courm2,AITA for wanting to cancel mother's day brunch ,"Last year, my mom bought me a pair of dissolving swim shorts as a prank, which led to an embarrassing situation for me. The prank occurred at a particularly inconvenient time when I wasn't home and had no access to other shorts. I only discovered it was a prank weeks later; initially, I just thought the shorts had malfunctioned.

This issue came to a head during a Mother's Day lunch. My mom, fiancée, and I were at a restaurant, and my mom brought up the prank, laughing about it. Although I tried to laugh it off, my fiancée and I expressed that we found it more embarrassing than funny. My mom responded dismissively, telling us to ""get over it,"" and then became rude to my fiancée, which escalated into an argument. I ended up walking away from the table as the situation deteriorated, with my mom aggressively stating that my fiancée was no longer welcome at future gatherings and affirming that she only supports me, her son.

This year, I invited her to a Mother's Day brunch. She agreed but specified she would only attend if my fiancée wasn't there, reiterating her stance from last year. Given her ongoing bitterness and refusal to apologize, I'm considering canceling the plans. She has a history of being harsh and overly direct, which I used to overlook. However, as an adult, I find it increasingly difficult to manage the stress this brings into my life.

AITA for wanting to cancel the brunch plans with my mom due to her continued hostility towards my fiancée and the overall strain on our relationship?

Update:
Cancelled plans. She was saying she was confused about it at first. Then she went back into her mode of not taking ownership and telling me it was my fiancees fault. Then I just stopped texting her. She said she has a friend that goes to my fiancees yoga class and that my fiancee talks shit about my mom there.... There's no way she would do that while coaching. Just another lie.

Anyways, thanks again everyone. It's hard to deal with right now because I have a lot of love for everyone. But I need to set my boundaries and she needs to take ownership if we want to move on.

Her curriculum looked pretty good they were good enough stuff to enter real life clinics in my opinion,however, looking at lara’s logbook it looks like she hardly passes her requirements. And I saw her work on acrylic teeth and it wasn’t looking good. Now how did she manage to make it to third years I don’t know but her she needs lots of help which I hope her professors will give her.

I talked to both lara and my husband and was very truthful that her skills need alot of work maybe she could ask for compensatory sessions in her university or something because her skills don’t make it in any real clinic. Her argument was that supposedly this year she is entering her university clinics I told her that 1.Uni clinics are much different than real clinics because uni clinics patient sign consent papers agreeing to get work done by students as young as her 2.Uni clinics have each student accompanied by a TA that follows them with every step, in my clinic I hire either 5th year students or post grad who know what they are doing and don’t need my assistance throughout the whole encounter with the patient in fact Iam not always present with them.

86,1cotyel,WIBTA If I pull my daughter out of SIL's wedding?,"So a bit of backstory, my husband's side of the family is notoriously not very kind to us. We get excluded from things, last minute invites when we are invited to something, and it is very clear that we are either not welcome or not really cared about. We have a daughter who just turned 5, and of course everybody loves her. She's a sweet little kid.

Husband and I celebrated daughter's birthday on Monday with a nuclear family dinner, just the 3 of us. We did not get to go to the restaurant I suggested, but we let daughter pick and she chose something else. No big deal, but is relevant to the story.

So SIL is getting remarried this month. She loves my daughter but treats my husband (her brother) like crap. Without asking us, SIL declared that daughter will be her flower girl. This isn't a big wedding, it is a small event in a nice park.

I just found out today that the ""sleepover"" MIL invited daughter to for tonight is actually her, SIL, BIL, their 3 kids, and FIL taking our daughter out to dinner to celebrate her birthday at the place I wanted to take her, without inviting me or my husband. Naturally I'm pissed because they made plans with my child and snuck it around us.

WIBTA if I pull daughter out of the wedding and do not attend? We won't give them a reason upfront, but the reason would be the lack of consideration of us and generally not involving daughter's parents in things they try to plan with her. If you want my minor child to attend an event, either communicate for real with me or invite her parents as well.

Edit to add a bit more info: MIL provides childcare for us, on her own request. she is happy to do it. she isn't generally the problem but isn't always considerate of us. SIL is the problem and everyone bends to her will, which is where MIL and FIL enable her. MIL offered to watch daughter overnight to give me and husband a date night since we don't really get time alone together, and we thanked her and accepted the opportunity. the family birthday dinner was planned behind our backs around that.

Daughter starts kindergarten in a few months and once she is in school we won't really have a need for her to be at grandma's house so often.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-10,"WIBTA If I pull my daughter out of SIL's wedding?

We have a daughter who just turned 5, and of course everybody loves her. She's a sweet little kid.

Husband and I celebrated daughter's birthday on Monday with a nuclear family dinner, just the 3 of us. We did not get to go to the restaurant I suggested, but we let daughter pick and she chose something else. No big deal, but is relevant to the story.

So SIL is getting remarried this month. She loves my daughter but treats my husband (her brother) like crap. Without asking us, SIL declared that daughter will be her flower girl. This isn't a big wedding, it is a small event in a nice park.

I just found out today that the ""sleepover"" MIL invited daughter to for tonight is actually her, SIL, BIL, their 3 kids, and FIL taking our daughter out to dinner to celebrate her birthday at the place I wanted to take her, without inviting me or my husband. Naturally I'm pissed because they made plans with my child and snuck it around us.

WIBTA if I pull daughter out of the wedding and do not attend? We won't give them a reason upfront, but the reason would be the lack of consideration of us and generally not involving daughter's parents in things they try to plan with her. If you want my minor child to attend an event, either communicate for real with me or invite her parents as well.

Edit to add a bit more info: MIL provides childcare for us, on her own request. she is happy to do it. she isn't generally the problem but isn't always considerate of us. SIL is the problem and everyone bends to her will, which is where MIL and FIL enable her. MIL offered to watch daughter overnight to give me and husband a date night since we don't really get time alone together, and we thanked her and accepted the opportunity. the family birthday dinner was planned behind our backs around that.

Daughter starts kindergarten in a few months and once she is in school we won't really have a need for her to be at grandma's house so often.",0.0,0.16461658477783203,0,1
87,1cotvkk,AITA: My wife gets frustrated that I don't wear my clothes in order.,"My wife and I split laundry work in that I bring it down to the basement, load it in and change it over before bringing it back upstairs and my wife puts the clothes away when they're done because she has a certain way she likes to fold and put clothes away. Which to me, is a fine division of labor and effort in housekeeping.

The way she puts clothes away though has very little to do with clothes being accessible or organized by type and more about putting them in order so that every piece of clothing has a chance to be worn. Clothes that are in drawers get rotated into the closet (a TINY closet in our NYC apartment) and then new clean clothes go into the drawers to await being put back into rotation. There isn't any organization beyond this, our clothes get mixed into drawers seemingly at random. Pajamas with dress shirts, sweatpants in the same place as sleeveless tees. So, clearly the order is the important factor to her and not being able to find or access clothes you want to wear, so I'm forced to look through everything to find an outfit you want to wear. Though to her, I should be only choosing what to wear out of what is in the closet.

I can understand this to a point and have said I can see the value in this system especially if that is something that is important to her. That I appreciate the level of organization and dedication she puts into our lives at home, but also that I won't be told I can't wear the clothes I want when I want to.

I'm a comfort outfit type of person. I know which of my shirts I love the most and what pairs of pants I like them with, what belt goes with which outfit, etc. However, I don't believe I need to wear them in a rotation and not being able to wear (or find) what I please is very frustrating to me.

I don't rip them out of the drawers and leave the rest a mess, I always carefully remove them and put other clothes back the way they were.

When I take clothing from a drawer instead of the closet, it instantly sours her mood and the morning becomes very tense. To the point where she passive aggressively asked ""Should I just throw all your clothes in the closet in the garbage?"" and has not put laundry away for the entirety of this week because ""What's the point? You're just going to wear whatever anyway."" I might wear those clothes again, just not that day and yes, maybe a few can be go to donation because I'm not wearing them as much (Which is what I said in response), but to me, that isn't something to get so upset about you have a nasty attitude with your spouse over it and leave the house for work in a terrible mood.

I see this as controlling and she sees my behavior as insensitive. But me wearing clothes ""out of order"" does nothing to our home or health, and has no negative impact on our lives other than her frustration with me not adhering to her system. Is this her being neurotic and controlling or am I the asshole?

88,1cotron,AITA for accusing my friend of lying about going to a festival?,"Before I start this, i would like to say that i really believe that i was in fact the asshole, and I have apologised to my friend since then (even though its still not that great between us). However my family believe that i didnt do anything wrong, whereas my school friends did, so what's better than to ask random strangers on the internet!

I (17f) have a friend called Julie (17f). We've been friends for around 5 years now, and we're in Year 12 (11th grade). My friend has a problem with lying randomly about random things, which is her only flaw really. For example, our friend group could be talking about carrots, and she would randomly say that her uncle owns a carrot farm (she hasn't said this, but its very hard to think of examples of what she's actually said on the spot, because she lies so frequently). Because of this, i triple check everything she says before i decide to believe it. 

In July, theres a festival called BST Hyde Park, and I bought tickets to see my favourite boyband, and i was obviously really excited. Julie is also a big fan of this band, so she said that she got tickets too. You see, this is where i might be an asshole, undertandably. I told my other friend Deera that I thought that Julie was saying another one of her lies again. Deera is very aware of Julie's lying habit, so i thought she would undertstand where im coming from. 

Initially Deera was undertanding, and even agreed with me that Julie might be lying, so we just left it at that. However, around a week later, Julie was visibly angry when i walked into the school garden to study with the friendgroup. I asked her what I did, and she proceeded to attack me for talking about her behind her back. Deera admitted that she told Julie about what I said, and said she was curious as to whether or not it was true that she got the tickets.

Julie then proceeded to give proof of the fact she in fact has them, and i felt awful so i immediently apologised to her for my assumption. But I did say to her that if maybe she cuts down on lying about things, I probably wouldnt of had that assumption. She denied lying about anything, which kind of made me a bit upset as I admitted my faults but she didn't.

The whole friend group is now a bit off about me, and i havent had anyone really talking to me, and I feel very isolated. I do feel like i deserve it as i did do something bad, but when I told my mu, she was very angry, stating that it couldnt possibly my fault if shes known for lying about everything.

For backstory: Me and my friends were all planning on going on a summer trip to Hawaii. The characters important to the story are A,K, and me. This friend group has existed since middle school and has continued out of college. A identified as lesbian, and K identifies as gay. A and K would make gay jokes (not jokes that came across as gay, jokes about being gay or mocking them)

I didn’t mind this because as long as A and K were gay and lesbian it didn’t really matter to me if they were making those kinds of jokes, as they are what they are making fun of so they have experience of what they’re like. But recently someone else in the group sent me a direct message of texts between her and her friend talking about how she fakes being gay for “benefits”(thats what she called them). So as the trip was coming up soon, I decided it would be best to show K. I wanted to make sure. Once he saw it he said he didn’t want to go on the trip anymore, and said fuck A for lying for years and doesn’t care if he wastes her money for already bought plane tickets.

98,1cos01w,WIBTA for not Inviting Some Family,"
My elder sister thinks I’m over reacting and should just invite my parents and aunt because they are my family.

My father has been in and out of my life since I was born as well as in and out of jail. When I don’t pick up his phone calls or email him, he guilt trips me. He has even threatened to show up at my house to “explain” why he’s mad then proceeds to call me fowl words.

My mother always makes herself the center of attention. For my senior prom, she cancelled for me to get my makeup done (I was paying) because she wanted to do my makeup. I told her I am fine with doing my own and would prefer it since the beautician cancelled (she told me she had cancelled). I found out later my mother cancelled the makeup appointment. I informed her that she was because she was there, but I still preferred her to not do my makeup. She ended up throwing a tantrum and going to my grandparents (I look up to them as my actual parents). 
My mother had also thrown a fit at my sisters wedding because she didn’t walk her down the aisle. My sister wanted a very basic wedding. She was beautiful. After my mother got upset about it, she left. Shortly after that, the rest of my family left without telling my older sister (bride). I stayed and hung out with her.

My aunt and I used to spend every summer together and she would shit talk my siblings and my parents. When over there, I’d hang out with my cousin during the day. He is absolutely spoiled. If I had something he wanted, my aunt would make me give it to him. My aunt and I would get into arguments over this and I stopped going over, but would still talk to her. Saying that, things had to ALWAYS go her way and she had to be in control. After we found out Papa had cancer, I would take him to and from his appointments (I was studying to be a nurse) and he gave me access and permission to look at his chart for information. When my aunt found out, she took my access away, changed his emergency contacts so I couldn’t call and ask for information, then changed his appointment dates and times so I could not attend. A few days prior to his surgery and passing, we got into an argument over this and she claimed she did it because she loved and worried for him more because he was her actual father. We didn’t speak until the funeral arrangements when she disregarded my grandmothers opinion. We continued not speaking until 6 months after the funeral when she called to inform me she has power of attorney over my grandmother and requested my help to help grandma clean her house (grandma has 2 adults living with her. My younger sister and mother). After going over and helping her, we haven’t spoke again, even a phone call to just chat. It’s been 3 months.

My fiancé supports me with my decision either way, but he leans toward not inviting them because of how they treat me and the drama. He wants me to be happy and not get upset or anxious on the wedding day.

100,1corowx,"AITA for calling my daughter an ungrateful, selfish brat?","My husband and I were never fabulously wealthy but we were comfortable. We were privileged enough to give our kids little extras here and there. My husband worked for a top company and I had my own business.

We have 2 daughters: Elizabeth is 21 and Jordyn is 18. When Elizabeth was in high school, we were able to pay for her prom dress and ticket, we got her a nice grad gift, etc. We also have college funds for both girls of equal amounts.

In January, the company my husband worked for went under. My small business declined during COVID and sadly it never recovered. In February, I made the difficult choice to shut it down as it cost me more to operate than we were making. My husband has struggled to find work in his field as it’s dwindling. I worked in a mostly freelance field and it’s hard to find work as well. Both of us have taken service jobs as we try to figure out what we’re doing next. Our savings have nearly depleted. We have cut back on all extras. We don’t go out to eat, no steaming services, no cable. We have internet and that’s because it’s needed for Jordyn’s homework.

Now, Jordyn’s college fund is safe. We’d never touch it. However, it has meant that we can’t afford to get her the prom dress she wanted. She got a job in March and paid for that. We were able to pay for her ticket. We also were transparent that her grad gift is going to be $25 as we can’t reasonably budget more right now. She hasn’t been happy and has made it clear. We’ve tried to sympathize as much as we can and told her we’re sorry we can’t give her as much. We’ve also had to stop sending Elizabeth extra money at college, so it’s not that Jordyn is the only one losing out. 

The final straw for her was when we couldn’t pay for her to go on her senior trip. It was that or the light bill. She got pissed at us and said Elizabeth got so much more her senior year. I said we were in a much different financial situation. She started calling us names. 

I said none of that was favoritism. We wish more than anything we could make it happen and we’ve tried our best to do what we can. She said it’s not enough. I snapped. All the stress collected in me. I called  her an ungrateful, selfish brat. I said this isn’t how we raised her. I added that she’s old enough to see all the sacrifices we’re making. Her dad is working 50 hour week, myself about the same. Oh well, she had to pay for her prom dress. Oh well, she can’t go on a trip. We might lose our house if things keep up. All of this she already knew as we’ve been transparent about our situation. That matters more than all this senior stuff.  

She got really quiet and then began to cry. She left the room. Elizabeth later called me and said I need to calm down and see Jordyn POV. I said I have more months. But at this point, she needs to open her eyes. We always tried to teach the girls the value of a dollar and not to take for granted what we have. 

My husband agrees with me. Jordyn hasn’t talked to me since.

101,1coqnxn,AITA. Plans changed. Voiced feelings. Now the bad guy. ,"Two nights ago, our cat had a seizure. Never happened before. She was sick and on treatment, vet said it may get worse, any changes, bring her back. My mom and I had a chat in the aftermath of the incident and decided that my mom, who doesn’t drive would organise to take her first thing the next morning as per vets advice. 
Next day rolls around, I’m thinking the cats at the vets. Waited worriedly all day for an update. Came home. Mom had never left the house as she was tired, cat seems fine and it was a hassle to call a taxi. I was a little surprised and disappointed at this as this wasn’t the plan and didn’t think it was the best for our cat - I didn’t voice this as anytime I share an opinion even with the greatest degree of diplomacy and open-mindedness, I’m told I’m over-analysing, causing confrontations and being difficult.  However, she said her and my dad will wait the weekend and go first thing Monday morning. 
Fast forward to today, sun is shining, the weather is gorgeous and I’m ready for the weekend after a very hard work week and a flare up of health issues. I thought, I’ll take some personal time and get off early…I call my mom when on the way home, she says it’d be great to spend some time in the sun, maybe even eat “al fresco”. Great! I thought. I get home, she’s booked a vets appointment and I’ll drive her up - it’s a long journey time to the vets - I have 30 mins to relax and then I’m on the road again to this appointment. When we get back, the beautiful weather will be gone. Initially, I was frustrated as the plan had changed from seeing the vet the morning after the incident, to then waiting several days over the weekend, to us enjoying a little lunch in the sun, to now we’re going to the vets. All changing without considering my opinion or my plans. I was a little frustrated. I tried to voice that, saying it wasn’t what I had planned for this lovely afternoon and she kept saying the cat was fine. I understood and agreed that we’ll go to the vets soon we rather than later. I’ll drive them. I agreed with her….Next thing, she’s saying I’m selfish not thinking what’s best for the cat, saying I’m over thinking the situation, it’s not that big a deal, I can still squeeze my afternoon plans in. I just agree with her. Then she changes her mind and starts refusing me driving her, saying she’ll just get a taxi now, arrange a friend to take her, she doesn’t want me helping anymore because she’s shocked at my “questioning of her plan and is so surprised I’m not putting our pet first”. I apologised. She continues that she doesn’t want me to help out. I apologise again and explain I was just caught off guard at the changes. She has now accepted I’ll drive her but she’s currently stonewalling me and has tears in her eyes.

103,1coq4pw,AITA for asking my roommate to not leave her wet clothes in the bathroom?,"little info: Lets call my roommate Anna

So Anna and I have been roommates for about a month now. She is a really nice person, however she has started doing one thing which is slightly annoying.

  
She leaves her wet clothes in our shared bathroom. She prefers washing her own clothes and does so when she's taking bath. She usually takes bath before I do, and, most of the time, I find her wet clothes lying on top of the tap in a tight bundle. 

Once I asked her to hang them out, but as she was calling someone, she signaled me to do it. I was fine with this, however, recently she has developed the habit of just leaving them there and asking me to do it.

  
Today when I went for a shower, I found her drenched nightdress sitting on top of the tap. I went to Anna who was scrolling though something on her phone and asked her why her wet clothes were there. 

She told me to hang them out. I asked her why couldn't she do it herself. She replied that she was too busy to do it. I told her that next time she ought to hang those clothes herself when she came out of the bathroom. 

She told that she can't do that as her hands are full everytime she steps out of the bathroom. I asked if she could make another trip to the bathroom after she comes out and hang the clothes to dry as it would take about 3-5 minutes . She then looked up angrily and said that she wasn't so jobless.

My family has a problem with setting boundaries. Grandma has always been difficult…demands final say and will talk down to everyone around her (family & service people alike). Aunt is the same way. She is unmarried with no children and for years has told us that she sees my siblings as her kids so we are expected to treat her like our mother. At this point, these are both one-way relationships and my siblings and I only interact with them at family events when others invite them. We are polite.

My mother, on the other hand, has been catering to their needs her entire life. They dictate what she does, when she does it. If she doesn’t agree, they will harass her until she gives in. Examples: They pick where we go to eat to celebrate mom’s birthday and pester her until she picks the food they want her to eat. If I invite my mom shopping but they aren’t invited, they will repeatedly call until she answers her phone and continue to talk the entire trip. If she hangs up, they call again and again. One time she told them she was shopping and couldn’t talk, then refused to answer their calls. They called the police and reported that they feared she was kidnapped and gave the location where we were shopping.

This weekend we are celebrating Mother’s Day. I worked with my siblings to plan a dinner out for my mom to celebrate her and then invited her. Her family found out and pestered her until she invited them. Now they want to change the location, date, and time. They also want to have assigned seating to ensure that Aunt and Grandmother get to see and talk with everyone. In the past when I have pushed back, I’ve been told by Aunt and Grandmother that I can’t control everything and to stop being a b!@ch. I know there is a line between appropriate boundaries and being too controlling but I don’t think I have crossed it.

111,1coonnp,AITAH: I [26/F] compared my [24/M] brother to our drug addicted cousin. Am I wrong for comparing him to get a point across?,"I [26/F] just had an argument with my estranged brother [24/M]. It was not pretty. 

For context, in 2020 my sibling [29/M] and I noticed a trend, my younger brother had picked up the habit of smoking weed almost daily and doing shrooms every now and then. At the time, he [24yo] lived with my parents who are completely against smoking weed or doing any kind of drugs. Eventually my younger brother got careless and my parents found his stash. We, as a family, did an intervention which led him to move out of my parents house and basically break all communication with my older brother and I— my parents were HEARTBROKEN.

After my parents BEGGED him to come home, he moved back in. At the time I was moving out, starting my career, so he wanted to keep my room; he did. Fast forward to 2024 and we have yet to mend our broken bond. Ive been living on my own and visit every now and then. We only talk when we absolutely need to. During my most recent visit, I dropped off gifts from my trip to Hawaii. I bought a cute present for him in which he thanked me for two weeks later via text. I accepted the thank you and apologized for not being direct in communicating that I left his present in the counter— the day I stopped by I had moved his weed-smelling car for my mom, something he was PISSED about. Somehow, the thank you text spiraled into an argument. He expressed anxiety for having me use his car. He thought I would complain about his car like I did about all the clutter he has left in our parents home (he has a messy room, so instead of cleaning, he has placed an 8 drawer dresser and boxes of stuff in the middle of my parents hallway for MONTHS. He works less than part time and does not go to school.

I tried explaining that my concerns about his clutter came from what my parents have said to me and because it’s been a nuisance when I stay. He said I had no right to criticize him and It was not my concern since I didn’t live there. My frustration led me to compare him to our drug addicted couisin, she does hard drugs like cocaine, etc. I told him that he is taking advantage of my parents like our cousin did with my aunt. Currently my parents will do anything to accommodate him so he doesn’t leave again. Our cousin [40/F] did the same to my [70/F] aunt who was a cancer survivor, had rheumatoid arthritis and lived in a trailer park with limited income. She [40/F] lived rent free with my aunt. My aunt catered to her on everything to make sure she was ok until she passed away of a heart attack about a year ago. 

AITH for comparing him to someone so shitty? I feel like he doesn’t understand how my parents are catering to him and walking on eggshells around him— just to keep peace and keep him from couch surfing again.

He never lets things go. For reference, the argument about his stuff being in the hallway happened like two months ago. What should I do? Am I the asshole? ",Asshole,2024-05-10,"AITAH: I [26/F] compared my [24/M] brother to our drug addicted cousin. Am I wrong for comparing him to get a point across? I [26/F] just had an argument with my estranged brother [24/M]. It was not pretty. 

For context, in 2020 my sibling [29/M] and I noticed a trend, my younger brother had picked up the habit of smoking weed almost daily and doing shrooms every now and then. At the time, he [24yo] lived with my parents who are completely against smoking weed or doing any kind of drugs. Eventually my younger brother got careless and my parents found his stash. We, as a family, did an intervention which led him to move out of my parents house and basically break all communication with my older brother and I— my parents were HEARTBROKEN.

After my parents BEGGED him to come home, he moved back in. At the time I was moving out, starting my career, so he wanted to keep my room; he did. Fast forward to 2024 and we have yet to mend our broken bond. Ive been living on my own and visit every now and then. We only talk when we absolutely need to. During my most recent visit, I dropped off gifts from my trip to Hawaii. I bought a cute present for him in which he thanked me for two weeks later via text. I accepted the thank you and apologized for not being direct in communicating that I left his present in the counter— the day I stopped by I had moved his weed-smelling car for my mom, something he was PISSED about. Somehow, the thank you text spiraled into an argument. He expressed anxiety for having me use his car. He thought I would complain about his car like I did about all the clutter he has left in our parents home (he has a messy room, so instead of cleaning, he has placed an 8 drawer dresser and boxes of stuff in the middle of my parents hallway for MONTHS. He works less than part time and does not go to school.

I tried explaining that my concerns about his clutter came from what my parents have said to me and because it’s been a nuisance when I stay. He said I had no right to criticize him and It was not my concern since I didn’t live there. My frustration led me to compare him to our drug addicted couisin, she does hard drugs like cocaine, etc. I told him that he is taking advantage of my parents like our cousin did with my aunt.

115,1cooe09,WIBTA for selling an expensive birthday gift ,"I (23F) have played violin since I was 9, my mother chose this instrument for me and I hated doing music lessons and the exams.

When I was 14 my mom and music teacher decided they wanted me to start playing Viola, i politely declined and thought that was that. Fast forward to the end of year concert and my music teacher conveniently ""needed"" someone to play the viola for the concert and so he started training me to play it.   
For those who don't know, the violin and viola are similar in how they are played they just use two different ""clefs"" and so the viola is in a lower key than the violin.  
I landed up learning how to play the viola in the matter of a few days due to the similarities and my mom and music teacher were THRILLED.

I thought that this was a one time thing, but after the concert my music teacher leant me his viola and then out of nowhere my mom announced that I was going to start doing exams on the viola as well as my violin. There was no prior discussion to this, my mom made the decision she wanted me to play viola professionally and so now I had to study it and do exams and I wasn't allowed a say in anything.

Over the next year I completed three viola, violin and piano exams and my mom was delighted with how far I was progressing. I, on the other hand, was truly miserable.

flash forward to my sixteenth birthday. My parents had been hinting heavily that they had bought me something I really wanted and I was so excited. I still didn't have my own phone at the age of fifteen and I thought my parents had finally bought me the phone I'd been begging for (i had been bullied mercilessly by other kids for being 15, almost 16 and not having my own phone)

I wake up on the morning of my 16th birthday and i open my first few presents, which I honestly don't remember, they were small things like sweets and stationary.   
Finally my parents tell me that my big sweet 16 present is waiting in my dad's office and I should go get it.

I run to the office and  look at the desk but can't see a present. My dad eventually comes cause i'm taking a while and points at the large box on the floor.  
I grab the box and go back to the living room and as I open this box I am greeted with... a Viola 

My mom had been telling my dad that I had been begging for my own Viola (I hadn't) and so he had splurged and bought me a really nice brand name viola with a big case. On top of this they bought me special strings for the viola priced at $1,200 EACH 

I acted like I was happy but I was so disappointed. I hated playing viola, it wasn't my choice and I had been wanting to drop it since I began.  
I eventually stopped doing lessons and performing when I was 18 and have barely touched my viola since  

Now I'm 23 and I moved in with my boyfriend. We have hardly any space in our flat and the viola case is so big and bulky and honestly very ugly.

116,1coo190,AITA for “bullying” a student?,"  
I (29F) am a 5th grade teacher, this is my 7th year teaching.

On Monday, our school had its field day. Our school takes field day very seriously and gives out ribbons and plastic bracelets and other prizes for 1st place in every event per group.   
  
One of my students (11M) I have this year is easily the most talented student I’ve ever had, he’s incredibly smart and just won the school spelling be, he’s kind and a great kid. His passion is sports, especially basketball. He’s very talented, and I know he has the high score in the school for the Pacer test, the sit up and push up tests. He absolutely dominated on Monday, and had many ribbons and bracelets and some other prizes to take home.  
  
One of his friends was in a different group and was probably the 2nd best student overall. This boy is a whiz in academics like the quiz bowl and also does basketball, he’s highly competitive but very close friends with boy 1.  
  
Boy 2 is autistic, the boys came in after the event and the second boy said something like “next year I’ll win”, they were doing friendly trash talk, which the boys in this friend group always do. They’re very nice kids, just competitive with each other.  
  
Their banter was loud and one of the girls overheard them. She doesn’t like the boys, but especially boy 2, who she sees as “weird”. I’ve had some conversations with her mom and her mom always says “autism isn’t an excuse to be weird”. The girl told boy 2 that he would “never” be as strong as his friend, she made a comment on why he’s so weird and made a comment about his sensory issues, the boys started defending him.  
  
On Tuesday, for our morning work, I decided to put on a video of the world’s strongest man talking about his autism. I also showed a few more videos of various athletes, including major ones like NFL players talking about autism. I asked the class their thoughts. The girl refused to participate and said that these videos were “stupid”. She said these people in the videos were “weirdos”. I told her she would get a 0 on her morning work and she said that was fine with her.  
  
On Tuesday night, I get an email from the mom of the girl. She said I was “bullying” her daughter for “not embracing the woke narrative on disability”. She said she would be contacting the principal because I was “trying to shove an agenda on her” and “forcing her to be friends” with the autistic boy and she said that giving my daughter a 0 was also bullying.   
  
My principal is a good guy, I discussed the email and he laughed it off and said I was fine. I also told my mom about this, who’s a retired teacher. My mom said I was in the wrong and I shouldn’t show “controversial” videos in my class. She said that she wouldn’t do that in her day and how I should apologize to the mom. She said the mom has the right to be concerned with “the rise of autism these days” and it’s my job to quell her fears, rather than make them worse.

117,1cony87,AITA for tearing down a picture of Tyler the Creator,"Edit: To preface I actually really love Tyler the Creator, and listen to his songs lots, it's just that in this situation my classmates used his meme against me in a mocking manner 

I (18 F) go to an all girls catholic school and as we are in our final year we are given access to use a small kitchen between classes. I have noticed that in previous years, the students have taken liberty to decorate the shared student kitchen, adding pictures and print-outs to reflect the student’s interests. So far this year no one had put up any decorations so I figured I would be the first. The image , which I attached to the fridge with magnets, was of one of my favourite male kpop idol, Ricky from the group Zerobaseone, who is of Chinese decent . It was small and less than A4 size but you would surely see it as everytime you walked into the kitchen as the fridge is smack bang in the middle of the area.

To my surprise and disappointment, the very next day the picture had been taken down. And a few days later a picture of Tyler the creator, in infamous mugshot meme, had replaced it alongside the caption “Me when I threw your kpop boy in the bin”. If this was a year ago I would have thought nothing of it, but as of recently an attitude for hating on kpop and other Asian interests has arisen amongst my classmate. Both non-asian and asian classmates have insinuated that acting disgusted towards k-pop music and culture is “cool” and have committed microaggressions to indicate their distaste. 

In response, I decided to publicly crumple and throw out their print-out in the bin. I meant is as a joke as my friends were watching me do it and were  laughing along. In hindsight I know that I probably shouldn’t have done that, however deep inside I felt that my expression of interest, that I don’t think caused any severe disturbance or genuinely hurt anyone, had been invalidated. In addition, it seems that I have started a trend of posting up meme print-outs , such as Jojo Siwa and cute cats, all over the school kitchen. But out of all of them, only mine including kpop have been torn down. 

A few hours later, as I returned to the kitchen to microwave my lunch, I was met with not one but two print-outs of tyler the creator, one with the caption “(my name) I don’t appreciate you throwing me out in the bin” and the other mocking me for adding a caution sign to the hot water tap. As both used my name directly, I was pointed and laughed at as my classmates and I felt embarrassed having to stand in the kitchen as my food finished heating up. 

I know that I acted slightly aggressively in that moment in time but I also feel that I have been unjustly targeted for my interest in kpop.

AITA?

TLDR: I (18 F) put up a picture of a kpop boy up in the shared school kitchen that is free to decorate. Another student put put Tyler the creator memes to mock me and so I tore them down.

118,1conx5b,AITA for canceling a family visit?,"AITA for telling cousins they can't visit from Europe at the last minute?

My (31F) family has always had somewhat strained extended relationships. My father, a German immigrant, had a falling out with his siblings before I was born; therefore, I don't know many of my cousins well. I grew up in IA, went to state university, and then law school in IN. Throughout childhood, I only met my two older cousins, (46F and 50ish F) twice when we traveled to Germany to see my grandparents. As a teen without a lot of familial connections, I tried to be ""pen pals"" with them through social media, but they weren't responsive and eventually, I gave up.

5 years ago, my parents were killed by a drunk driver the summer before I was to start law school. My grandfather, who was in his early 80s (and has since passed too), came to stay with me for a month. My cousins never offered condolences... not even a social media post. 

I graduated last year, and ended up with a firm in LA. When I posted beach pics, one cousin reached out to ask me where I lived. She said she had always wanted to go to CA, and added that my other cousin had never been to the US. She asked how much room I have.

I was taken aback, because I had not officially invited her, and I also didn't indicate whether the timing worked for me. She never asked.

My (31F) family has always had somewhat strained extended relationships. My father, a German immigrant, had a falling out with his siblings before I was born; therefore, I don't know many of my cousins well. I grew up in IA, went to state university, and then law school in IN. Throughout childhood, I only met my two older cousins, (46F and 50ish F) twice when we traveled to Germany to see my grandparents. As a teen without a lot of familial connections, I tried to be ""pen pals"" with them through social media, but they weren't responsive and eventually, I gave up.

5 years ago, my parents were killed by a drunk driver the summer before I was to start law school. My grandfather, who was in his early 80s (and has since passed too), came to stay with me for a month. My cousins never offered condolences... not even a social media post.

119,1conm75,AITA for yelling at unsupervised kids on 4-wheeler ,"We live back on dirt roads that are often used for off-roading. There are some kids that live on the road behind us that are constantly riding a 4-wheeler and dirt bike up and down these roads . I'm talking about a real 4 wheeler -not some little power wheels thing.  They go very fast -even around corners. One of them is in our child's class -4th grade (9 or 10) and the other is a year or two younger .  These kids are never supervised while riding and it scares the crap out of me knowing how easy it is to flip and/or crash.  They even fly up the hill next to our house that people sometimes drive down. It seems like it's a ""way of life"" around here to let your kids roam free and have fun, but I feel like this is taking it too far. I'm always worried I'll find one of them flipped . 
Well yesterday was the last straw for me. I was taking a walk with a neighbor , the dogs and my toddler in the hiking backpack. The kids suddenly came flying around the corner behind us. The one on the 4 wheeler wasn't even looking forward. He was looking back at his brother for a good several seconds instead of straight ahead so he didn't even see us. I moved out of the way before he got close enough to hit us and put my hand out for him to stop. Once he stopped I proceeded to yell at him and tell him they need to slow down and watch where they are going. 
Unfortunately this isn't the first time something has been said to them so I doubt it'll help. Nobody has spoken to the parents but I have a feeling they won't do anything given they think it's okay to let the kids ride alone. The neighbor who was walking with me has a state police officer for a husband and he mentioned stopping by in uniform to have a talk -maybe it'll scare them enough to be careful.

I have a seizure disorder that makes me have seizures when under stress. I also have pretty strong OCD about the way my house looks when we have quests and such. One a daily basis the floors are swept and mopped, the house is tidy but when I have my kids come for a visit I pretty much deep clean my entire house. If it’s not it makes my anxiety go thru the roof and I have seizures. 
I found out that my older kids were planning on “surprising” me this weekend with a visit for Mother’s Day. Ok side note: I broke my ankle really bad last summer and my mobility is still an issue. My husband also does not help in housework, ever.
So last night one of my kids asked if I wanted to go to the beach with him and his fiancées family. I declined because my seizures have been actually spontaneous even when I’m not stressed. This gives me more stress thinking about having a seizure while on a day trip or something. So I told my husband today that my son invited me, but I declined the offer. Then things got turned around that nobody can never do anything nice for me or a surprise because I let my cleanliness of the house get in the way and I give myself too much stress thinking about “ what if I have a seizure”? 
Now my house is not big but it’s 3 bedrooms, 2 baths. We have 2 dogs and a cat. This creates lots of pet hair and dirty floors. Preparing for anyone coming over is a good 5 hour clean because it’s hard for me to stand up and move for longer then 45 mins or so at a time. I have stressed to my family several times that I do not like surprise visits, it stresses me out really bad. Everyone ignored this and was making plans to “ surprise “ me on Saturday evening . My son thought that would be now easier to do so since I would be at the beach all day.
Another side note: I use oxygen 24/7 also. I have portable oxygen, so I can go out. I currently only have 1 small tank to use for any dr appointments. I would have had to already schedule an oxygen delivery if I needed more for the weekend. I do normally keep 4 canisters at home but we had a power outage earlier in the week overnight so I just used my portables. 
Ok so that’s the background. 
My husband is now pissed at my son for the beach offer saying he screwed up the whole surprise. The kids had a plan to visit, clean the house and stay overnight. In theory it sounds nice but in reality that is a nightmare for me. Just even making sure I have drinks( sodas , waters) snacks and other foods are also very important to me. I cannot drive due to me seizures and my ankle that is still not healed.

124,1comvcx,AITA for forcefully shutting my brother down after he tried to shame my daughter for seeking her birth family?,"My husband and I adopted our daughter 18.5 years ago. She had been left at the hospital by her birth mother, who was never found, and they had no known father or other family for her. We never hid her adoption or the truth surrounding her ending up with us. But we have always worked with professionals to help us navigate her journey. We wanted her to feel loved and secure. We also wanted her to feel heard about any feelings or thoughts she had. From a very young age she was curious about her birth family. We always said we would help her search one when she was old enough and if she chose to search.

It was a decision she brought to us a few weeks after her 18th birthday. She said she felt like it would always be a regret if she didn't try. So we did our very best to help her do a biological parent search. But over a year of searching later and we found nobody. Not a biological relative through any of the online dna places and not anyone based on the name her birth mother gave, which could be fake. This was difficult for her and a few weeks ago she told us she feels like they don't want to be found. We comforted her and made sure she knew if she wanted to keep searching we would continue supporting her.

Our families were always aware of the search but apparently my brother had a problem with this that he decided to bring up in a way that shamed my daughter for searching. First time his question took on an accusatory tone I told him to watch what he was saying but then he said something incredibly judgmental and as a way to shame her, asking why she cared so little for us when we're the ones who wanted her and raised her. I told my brother that is not how he talks to either of my children and he better apologize because there is nothing wrong with wanting to know your biological parents or relatives and how dare he make it seem like there is.

I went dinner early at request of in-laws to help with kids - all were very tired and not behaving as well as usual. In-laws decided to do dinner early because of this. FIL left right after dinner, randomly causing toddler to nonstop cry. Oldest also started crying about being cold. Baby was absolutely covered in egg/sauce so I couldn’t put him down (in-laws very protective of their expensive rugs, which is fair).

We’d usually bath them and get them in PJs - but in-laws are renovating so no bath, and shower is surrounded by reno material. So I made the decision to rush home to bath there instead waiting for partner, which could be up to another 30 mins.

We live a 5 min walk away so I loaded up the pram and jogged most the way. Just as I’d got all kids back and into bath, partner calls up annoyed because they’d got to their parent’s house and we weren’t there. I tried to explain that I had no chance to call/txt earlier, but they just hung up.

2 minutes later partner gets home still angry. 
I was annoyed they’d hung up and at their lack of compassion so I responded in turn, and it escalated into a huge argument.

I’d done what I thought was best for our kids - getting them warm and to bed asap. When I get home late I’m always especially careful not criticise how my partner managed our kids/household, because I know how difficult evenings can be with all 3. 

Partner had to drive past our house on way to their parents, so I’d hoped they’d see us walking home, or see the lights on when they drove past. I even thought they’d be grateful I’d done the hard work of packing up kids + bags (partner earlier expressed they’d rather go home instead of parents after their long day).

Partner thinks I was selfish and inconsiderate, and I should have apologised immediately for not keeping them in the loop. They’re also upset we didn’t pack them dinner-to-go, which hadn’t been offered. 

I still think I did my best in prioritising the kids, that I genuinely didn’t have time to update my partner (end of dinner to bath took 15 mins max, with baby not going down the entire time), and it was rude of them to hang up without any of the context, and their anger wasn’t appropriate for the mild leve of inconvenience.

We’d usually bath them and get them in PJs - but in-laws are renovating so no bath, and shower is surrounded by reno material. So I made the decision to rush home to bath there instead waiting for partner, which could be up to another 30 mins.

We live a 5 min walk away so I loaded up the pram and jogged most the way. Just as I’d got all kids back and into bath, partner calls up annoyed because they’d got to their parent’s house and we weren’t there. I tried to explain that I had no chance to call/txt earlier, but they just hung up.

2 minutes later partner gets home still angry. 
I was annoyed they’d hung up and at their lack of compassion so I responded in turn, and it escalated into a huge argument.

I’d done what I thought was best for our kids - getting them warm and to bed asap. When I get home late I’m always especially careful not criticise how my partner managed our kids/household, because I know how difficult evenings can be with all 3. 

Partner had to drive past our house on way to their parents, so I’d hoped they’d see us walking home, or see the lights on when they drove past. I even thought they’d be grateful I’d done the hard work of packing up kids + bags (partner earlier expressed they’d rather go home instead of parents after their long day).

Partner thinks I was selfish and inconsiderate, and I should have apologised immediately for not keeping them in the loop. They’re also upset we didn’t pack them dinner-to-go, which hadn’t been offered. 

I still think I did my best in prioritising the kids, that I genuinely didn’t have time to update my partner (end of dinner to bath took 15 mins max, with baby not going down the entire time), and it was rude of them to hang up without any of the context, and their anger wasn’t appropriate for the mild leve of inconvenience.

Partner stayed out late last two nights and told their mates, who all think I’m being an asshole - so AITA?",0.0,0.11258083581924438,0,1

I wanna move out by the end of summer because next school year will be my last and I wanna make the best of it but the way things are not I don't think it's going to happen...not long ago it was my birthday like 2wks 

You would think I would be out the house?
No....I was ""grounded"" for 1 single assignment I miss out when my family saw it in the grade book they freaked like it was the end of the world 

I had cancelled all of my plans that weekend with my mum and some of my friends (also my mum isn't apart of this she lost custody a long time ago due to some complications we still talk all the time) I was devastated....my friends were in disbelief of how I was being treated on my 18th birthday 

I had a mental break down for 3hrs my dad came in the room to ask me what was wrong?
I couldn't say anything because on the inside all I felt was hatred for my family...my father carry on like nth happened like he was oblivious to what he was doing 
I assume that he told my grandmother Abt it and she came in my room in a rush

She gaslighting me for a hour straight-
Saying it was ""my fault you did this to yourself!""
(...ik I'm not crazy or anything but it was one assignment and mind you the semester just started) moving on to say I should be like other family members comparing me and all 
She even compared me to herself saying oh when I was younger I use to ""play around""
(Side note: when she means playing around she's talking about having sex)

So I come out visible distress in public even my little cousins could tell that smth was wrong with me but not my grandmother 
She started to take pictures of me trying to say u should smile...
That pretty much wraps up that day...but the next day my PS4 was revoked and my 2 controllers I bought as well taken away-
My family was like o we can take everything from you etc
At that moment I have never in my life wanted to rage cause my older brother brought the PS4 but I got the other stuff....I have close connection with him but I no longer able to see him anymore due to the family being toxic to him as well so we talk once in a while.
My family has always been strict on what time I come home mind you I take the bus so there's really no telling  when I get home

She pre made a list of songs she wanted while people were eating at the reception and made sure to tell me I can’t deviate from it at all. She was very restrictive of what I could play for dancing.no rap or hip hop, no country, i had to send her the pop songs in advance to see if she approved of them & people werent dancing to the music SHE chose.

128,1colszc,AITA for 'letting' my stepkids miss a big Mother's Day celebration with us to be with their maternal family?,"I married my husband Mike 4 years ago and we started dating 7 years ago. He lost his late wife 10 years ago. His late wife was the mother of their twins Frankie and Kenzie (16). From the start of my relationship with Mike the twins would celebrate Mother's Day with their maternal family. Mike had joined once or twice but his relationship with his late wife's family was never super good and he felt like his presence was more uncomfortable for everyone than it was reassuring so he stepped back. Then we met and it never even occurred to me that they would stop doing that. I did not marry Mike to be their new mom or anything silly like that. I was marrying Mike because we loved each other and because his kids and I get along fine so we don't have issues. But we never expected more than what would happen naturally over time.

Mike's parents moved to be closer to all their children who all live within a 50 minute drive from each other. And they wanted to do a big Mother's Day celebration this year. Mike informed them that the twins wouldn't be coming because they'll be with their maternal family on the day. This raised some questions and they asked how I felt about it and Mike told them I never had a problem with it.

This led to me getting a call a few days later and them asking me why I 'let' my stepkids celebrate Mother's Day elsewhere when I have been acting as their mother for 7 years... to be clear I didn't even know them 7 years ago. It was 6 years ago I met them and even then I wasn't raising them or having any real influence in their lives. I told them it's what they always did and nothing had changed. I wasn't going to stop it. My ILs said it's very different now because my son is here now and the twins have another sibling. I told them it didn't take from them being with their mom's family for Mother's Day. They said the fact I ever let it happen was horrifying and they should be celebrating me on the day. They told me how much harm I had done to my family by allowing this to happen for so long but especially this year most of all.

129,1colqhj,AITA for not supporting my partner’s newest business venture involving accents?,"I’ve never posted in a groups like this before, but I’m need advice on this situation.

I (28F) and my partner (26M) have been together for 3 years. We love and support each other and enjoy each others company. 

My partner (we’re gonna call him Liam), is the smartest and funniest guy I ever met. He is also quite good looking and very kind, so you can call him the whole package.

He has recently been dealing with some mental health problems (by recently I mean for the last 7 months or so). To shorten the story, he’s basically been having crazy mood swings in this time, resulting in a bit of a roller coaster of great times and terrible ones. He’s been in treatment for this, which is still in progress.

He also has a curios personality, meaning that he likes to explore ideas that he sees, to the point where he gets too excited. When he enters into this stage, he often produces a flurry of business ideas. Examples of this are: video game and an content creator (Instagram).
He also gets bored of them easily and then stops them and changes to the next one (this is importan for later.) 


For the last few weeks he seems to have been on an “upswing”. His mood is great, he’s doing so much around the house, and he seems to be really excelling at work. The problem is though, he’s become latched on to this “business idea” which involves him starting a podcast pretending to be both an Indian guru and a Vietnamese man.

This started when he got a call from “Steve from Microsoft” who told him he had “problems with his router”. Obviously this was a scam call, but since then, he has been mimicking “Steve” and trying to get the accent right. At first it was funny, so I laughed and told him his accent was quite good. 

Unfortunately, I think he took my praise too seriously as he continued to, in his words “refine” the accent. He also began to practise other accents, and started watching voice acting videos on YouTube.

Since coming to me with his business idea, he has been using his accents in around 80% of our conversations (including serious ones). I’ve asked him to stop on multiple occasions, but he either says he’ll stop and then immediately starts again, or he just responds with another accent. 

Needless to say, this is driving me insane.

I don’t care if he practises his accents, but  I don’t want my serious conversations to be responded to by a man pretending to be an old Indian guru.

I think I’ve been very patient, but this is now beginning to affect me. I’ve begun to think about the possibility of leaving him. Obviously not just for this, but because I know he’ll abandon this soon and I’m worried about what will come next. AITA?

UPDATE

Thanks everyone for the advice.

I decided to go with him to one of his appointments and mention the symptoms to the doctor and see if it’s any of the illness mentioned in the comments. 

I guess it makes sense that even tho he is on treatment, he hasn’t responded well to any of the meds provided by his doctor.

I created this post initially because the thought of leaving him was eating me alive. I know it might sound silly, but he hasn’t always be like this, so I was thinking it will be pretty shit of me when he needed me the most, but also because there might be a chance he could get back to normal.

130,1colf4f,AITA for calling my sister to focus on herself she insinuated I was a bad mother? ,"My sister “Kate” has always been competitive with me. I guess because she’s older she feels like I stole the show by…being born. We’ve never been close because every time we are getting along, some real life event will cause her to spiral into being resentful of me and then she hates me for a while and we have to build back up to talking again. 

Kate’s daughter is 3, mine is 2. 

I had bad antenatal depression. I despised everything about being pregnant, I do not remember being remotely happy until my daughter was born. I had therapy throughout to keep myself sane but it was honestly the darkest time in my life. When my daughter was born, I threw myself into “bouncing back”. I didn’t experience any baby blues and I credit that mostly to the fact that my “rest” time was spent working on myself. I think that helped me more than the therapy. I love my daughter and everything about being her mother, but I don’t regret investing time in myself as well. 

I never told Kate any of this. She visited once when my daughter was a month old and by the time I saw her six months later I had shed most of the weight and was back to dressing normally. Kate has alluded to thinking I’m shallow because of how much effort I put into my looks but I’ve always reminded her different things work for different people’s mental health. 

It was my uncles birthday a few days ago so we all had a family dinner. My aunt was talking about pregnancy (they are thinking of having a second child) and said she wasn’t sure she could go through it again. I said I wouldn’t and she said that was odd since I handled it “like Wonder Woman” and you couldn’t tell I’d ever been pregnant (I’m not claiming this to be true. I just didn’t see anyone until I had a handle on everything and they assumed it was always like that). Kate scoffed and said “yeah it’s easy when your only priority is how you look and not your child” which is unfair and untrue. I’m a good mother, and I work very hard at being a good mother. I would have my daughter over my looks in a heartbeat but it’s not either or for me and I choose both. But what she said struck a nerve. I snapped back that my priority was my own family, and my own body, and maybe hers should be too rather than her jealousy because only one of those things is going to improve things. She called me a bitch and her husband jumped in and said she needed to calm down, which I know irked her because he has been the one most often comparing us. Kate left the table and when she came back it was clear she had been crying. She didn’t say a word the rest of the evening. 

My parents think I was too harsh on Kate, but I think they baby her because they think I have it “easier” (it’s been like that our whole lives). What she said to me was hurtful and uncalled for and all I did was remind her to mind her own business. But my parents think I owe her an apology. 

Did I overstep?

He told me he would make it up to me and we could celebrate another time.

I still live with him (not for much longer). My mom died when I was 7 and my dad got married again when I was 11 or 12. It's been a few years anyway. His stepdaughter never knew her bio dad, so my dad has accepted her as his own. And he has prioritized her a lot in the last 5/6 years. It doesn't always show in the most obvious ways but it can be felt. Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him.

He has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers.

He will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say ""kids can choose"" he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants.

Our refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time. His stepdaughter's birthday was coming up so he took money from my birthday fund to pay for that stuff and so his stepdaughter would definitely get what she wanted (this barbie house thing and a whole fashion set and they were I think dad said $250). He didn't get all the money back by the time my birthday came around so instead he bought me a $30 gift card for Steam when he had promised me a new monitor and keyboard for my computer (that was a gift from my grandparents).

When my dad told me he wouldn't be at my graduation to go and support her, I told him there is no making up for that and he can forget about being included in my life going forward. He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time. Dad begged me to be reasonable but I walked away. Then I invited both sets of grandparents who agreed to come. His wife told me I could have come with them and I don't need to attend the ceremony but could support ""my sister"". I said her daughter's not my sister and I do not want to support their family anymore and I will be out of their hair soon. She called me selfish and told me I can't deny her daughter a dad.

132,1col4t9,AITA for keeping my career above friends this one time?,"Long story short, my friends and I were planning a trip but I was reluctant to go as I had a lot of work. But one of them convinced me so I agreed but asked them to keep a date between x&y dates as I had some commitments. Other friends were ok with any date. We were still finalising on dates when my friend told to do it before x. I told that it wont be possible for me due to my prior commitments. I had actually asked her only to plan the trip (like places, booking and all coz if I would do it she will have issues with everything & neither I had the time or energy to do it). So nothing is planned. The date being proposed for trip is 7 days ahead from when we are discussing it. I showed my concern over packing, shopping in such a small duration so my friend started shouting on me that I only think about myself. I had suggested that instead of a trip we can meet at home for 1-2 days but they did not agree. 
We disconnected the call & I feel like people just walk all over me. Now I am not picking up group calls. No one apologised. Other 2 call on group & I don’t feel like picking it up. Obviously trip was cancelled. 

I got busy with work and sometimes genuinely didn’t get time pick call. 1 time I didn’t pick knowingly. Should I have deprioritised my work & agreed for trip coz now my friendship is at stake. Also think if I had just agreed to what they were saying this whole argument wouldn’t have happened.

133,1col3xm,AITA for not wanting to invite a grandparent to my wedding?,"I (27 female) am getting married next year to the love of my life. I want to start by saying me and my grandmother never had the picture perfect relationship that many others had with their grandparents. As a kid I was scared to go over and spend the night, I often wouldn't go without my sister or cousin there, as I hated going alone.
My grandmother used to often criticise me and my family. When I was 13 I got cut off from birthday cards, however I didn't find out until I was 17 as my dad was so ashamed he would buy me cards in there place. And when ever I saw her there was often comments on My body (telling me to loose weight and when I lost 56 lbs I was too skinny) to be completely honest i felt like she wasn't really a grandparent to me.
However the reason that made me consider not inviting her was that at my sisters wedding she caused a SCENE! She got drunk before we even had the meal and started saying inappropriate things to the guests and threatening to stand on my sisters dress! We asked her to calm down, which led to her running off and going missing for the rest of the night. (She was found in a near by bar). Since then she hasn't spoken to our family in almost 8 months and when I tried to go round to give my grandfather a birthday card I was locked out the house. I've over heard my dad cry multiple nights because he hasn't been aloud to see his dad (he's not very well) and he has also heard the vile things my grandmother has said about our family.
I have tried to reach out and everytime I get nothing, I got engaged and had a party to which they didn't come. I feel like I'm so done and don't want them to come to my wedding when I can't even go to their home.
I expressed to my immediant family and My fiancé's family how i am considering this , everyone's reactions has been mixed some telling me I should still invite them and some telling me I'm not wrong for feeling this way.
So I guess what I'm asking is would I be an asshole if I don't invite her?

134,1cokfoc,AITA for telling my dad I have no plan to ever do the same Mother's Day things for my stepmother that I did for my mom?,"I'm (16f) the youngest of my parents five kids together. But last year my dad had a child with his second wife. I was only 8 when my mom died and 11 when my dad remarried. Before mom died my siblings and I used to make her breakfast in bed and we'd write her loving and silly letters and sing her songs. My oldest brother used to get us all together to do that and it always made mom so happy. 

After my dad remarried he mentioned doing it again to my older siblings and they were very clear that his new wife was not a mother in their lives and they were not going to ever do it for her. Dad had hoped that me and my brother (17m) would be more bonded with his wife and might do it ourselves. But we never did. And we never did anything on Mother's Day with her or dad after they got married because he expected us to start doing stuff for her ourselves but none of us saw her as a mother and therefore we didn't celebrate her on the day.

I have an okay relationship with my stepmother. I say stepmother out of basic respect but like my siblings I see her more as someone dad is married to and not someone who is my parent or really a close family member at all. This disappointed her but we all remember mom and none of us wanted a second mom.

So last year my dad and stepmother had my half sister together and dad figured this would be the reason my brother and I would do this stuff for his wife. He asked my other siblings if they would visit for the day and they all said no. They actually said they thought all five of us should spend the day together if we wanted. Dad told them it would mean so much to his wife if they came to see her for Mother's Day this year, since it's her first one as a mother and my three siblings didn't care. My brother and I accepted our siblings invite though and that's when dad sat us down and told us he had expected us to want to spend the day around his wife and he told us that this year is a very big deal for her and weren't we wanting to celebrate the mother of our youngest sibling? My brother said he'd rather celebrate mom with our siblings. I agreed with him. He brought up what we used to do for mom and how we could involve our half sister eventually in doing it and let our stepmother feel some of that love and joy that our mom felt when she was alive. He asked when we planned to do it for our stepmother because we never know when it might be too late. I told him I never planned to do the same Mother's Day things for her as I did for mom because one is my mom and the other isn't.

Dad said it wasn't fair and my stepmother would have gladly been another mother if I had been willing. He told me to have decided I will never do it meant I never gave my stepmother a chance to be someone important enough to me and he said he was disappointed we had all made that decision so early on and nothing changed our hearts.

135,1cokb51,AITA for waking my partner up to take his cat to the EV at night?,"We (33F & 35M) have 3 cats and a dog, and one of the cats (Babylone, female, nearly 14) is my partner's, as he got her before we met. However, I've been treating her as if she was my own since I moved in with him in 2020.

Babylone has had renal deficiency for about 2 years, it was diagnosed when I started to worry about her weight loss and took her to the vet. She is on meds and had been doing great up until now, putting weight back on and being her usual lively and cuddly self. A few months ago, she also got a cyst/tumor on her jaw. The vet said that they would not advise removing it as it is in a very delicate area and it didn't seem to bother her, so leave it be.

Yesterday we got to bed at around 10 PM and I saw she hadn't eaten. She wasn't as lively as usual, jumping on the bed to get cuddles as soon as we get there, yesterday she didn't. I told my partner she seemed off, and he said ""she'll be fine, she's grumpy, go to sleep"".

I heard her puke at about 12, thought I'd have to take her to the vet in the morning. Woke up again at 2 and saw she had retreated into a hiding spot, pet her but she was unresponsive. Couldn't sleep anymore, and at 4, decided to call the EV as she obviously was sick and I was worried she'd die before morning. Luckily the EV last night was my usual vet. They told me she was probably suffering from her kidney problem and could be dehydrated, so I should bring her.

I woke my partner to tell him I was taking Babylone to the vet, as I thought he'd want to come as well or know where we were gone. He had slept through everything else as he is a VERY heavy sleeper. I was very surprised at his reaction. He told me that we could have waited until 8 to call, that she wasn't going to die (but also that it was going to happen anyway, given that she's sick) and that if I was that worried, we should have taken her yesterday night.  
He said that taking her to the vet now was not a service to her but to me, as I just wanted to relieve my own stress. That hurt a lot.

At the vet they took a blood sample, put her on IV fluid, and told us to call back at 10. My partner told the vet ""with her cyst and her kidneys I think it might be the end"". I was a bit shocked, as the vet had not mentioned this at all, and the vet seemed a bit shocked too. My previous cat had diabetes and I had her PTS when she became obviously sick, so I'm all for euthanising a suffering cat, I just thought this was a bit premature, as she had been doing great up until yesterday evening.

He's tired these days and really loves his cat, so this might be pre-grief/avoidance, but acting that insensitive is really weird to me. BTW, I will pay the vet bill as usual, as I'm the one with the most income, so it's not about the money.

Now we're back home and he avoids the subject. I'll likely be the one who gets Baby back, but I don't get his behaviour and I'm still hurt about what he told me.

138,1cojsyv,AITA for spending $180 on gifts for a friend?,"Some background, I (28f) have been working with one of my colleagues Lea (32f) for the last 6 years. Our company went through a lot of upheaval during the pandemic and most of the people we previously worked with left, she was one of the only colleagues to stick around. We also have similar interests and personalities so all of that combined has made us really close friends.

What's happened recently: Lea and her husband have been trying to have children for some time and it hasn't been the easiest journey but they finally succeeded. She's about 4.5 months pregnant now and I'm really happy for her. Her birthday is coming up in two weeks so I decided to go all in on getting some gifts for her, both for her birthday and in advance of the baby. She loves reading/books, so I got her two special edition books by her favourite author, two parenting books, a few board books for kids, and one of those month-by-month scrapbooks where you can track your baby's milestones. I also got a set of stationery and stickers she could use for the scrapbook, and a stuffed animal for the baby. It all came up to about $180 which I was happy to spend, like I said we're close friends and she would do the same for me.

The issue is my girlfriend (26f) is pretty pissed that I ""spent so much"" on a colleague especially since (in her words) the baby isn't even here yet so why buy all that stuff. According to her I shouldn't be throwing money around on frivolous purchases, especially to the tune of almost $200.

139,1cojnty,AITA for shutting down and being distant from my wife for yelling at me?,"Just a bit of history before we dive into it. I started dating my wife about 1 1/2 years ago and we decided to get married 7 months into our relationship. We both live in the US, but our parents and relatives live outside the US. So we decided to get married in my wife's hometown instead.

Soon after we set our wedding date, her mother passed away suddenly because of a heart attack. My wife flew back to her parents home for the funeral and stayed there till we got married 6 months later. We decided to keep our date because her mom was really excited for our wedding.

Since then my wife has been going through a roller coaster of emotions ever since she lost her mom, but i have tried to be there for her every step of the way. Unfortunately i couldn't go with her for the funeral and be with her because of travel visa realted issues. So, i know I could have done more, I wasnt able to comfort her the way she wanted me to.. i wasnt there for her in person when she really needed me. I called her every day and spoke for hours until she would cut the call, but i know in my heart that its not enough and i am sorry for that.

That said, my wife has a short temper and she tends to snap at me, sometimes for the smallest of reasons. And when she does yell at me, i sort of shut down. I dont respond well to being yelled at. I think it might be because I myself grew up in a not so pleasent, happy home. My parents would have verbal fights almost every day followed by my mom crying hysterically. My elder brother would also get involved and it would end up in just chaos. I wont go into details here, but growing up wasnt and spending my teens in that environment was probably not the best thing. 

I have told my wife about my past, the sort of childhood I've had and why I end up shutting down, feeling worthless and angry. She continues to do it anyway and then gets upset because of my reaction. She tells me that I dont love her because of the way I react to it. And then she sends me reels of how men who actually  love their wives treat them. Basically, how i should be reacting and treating her. 

An example of her snapping at me is for me accidentally tipping at a self-service restaurant when we had spoke the previous day about how people dont generally tip at such restaurants and that there's no real need to tip there because we arent getting any table service.

I usually  dont talk about my feelings with anyone and the 4 times I have tried (parents, brother and wife) to tell them, it seemed like they did not care and it just fell on deaf ears. But i do tell my wife quite often that yelling at me wont work, i dont remind her how it makes me feel though..

I figured based on the short notice she would have to buy locally, and knowing my sister (who is a single parent of 4) doesn't have a lot of money, I offered to pay for nieces prom dress. My sister declined, said she wanted it to be a bonding thing between she and my niece, and that she would ""figure it out"" regarding the cost. 

Apparently her way of figuring it out was buying some dress off of a Tiktok ad, which turned it to be a scam. My sisters solution was that my niece could just wear one of her own dresses to prom, because there wasn't enough time to order anything else, and she'd already spent her prom dress money on this scam dress. 

My niece texted me pretty upset about the whole situation, and so I ended up taking her to the mall and letting her pick out a dress she was happy with. My sister then was *pissed* at me saying she ""already told me to butt out"" and that ""I need to stop flaunting my money around.""

My brother 20m and me 22 m move into an apartment together with his wife 19?

So a couple weeks go by, me and Marie get pretty close, watching anime and bonding through demon slayer (nothing like you’re thinking perverts) on the second weekend of her being here he starts throwing her stuff out onto the lawn, so my sil, marie and I are all wondering what’s going on, so we put all of her stuff into a safe location and we go out for the day, (just me and Marie and one of my friends) halfway through our day Marie gets pretty upset over something, I’m not sure what it was, and she wouldn’t say what it was, so we just went home
When we arrive she says she has to be out by tonight (sent by a text through my sil) and ofc she doesn’t tell me why either, so we pack the rest of her belongings and help her move in to her relatives house, (i proceed to help her by helping to move her things with my truck, let her use a laptop of mine for school, doing as much as i can so she can have a head start getting her life together).

Another week goes by and they start acting petty to me, my brother doesn’t say anything to me, (he doesn’t even talk to his wife very much, yes they just sit there and stare at eachother sometimes). My sil starts sending me texts demanding that I don’t bring Marie over and states she doesn’t care if we remain friends, and a bunch of other things small enough not to be mentioned, if she were to ask I wouldn’t have cared as much as I do, so I call my brother and tell him if he doesn’t get his ducks in a row I won’t be paying for half of the extra room, that I’ll only pay for my room, 1/3 of the rent, if they want to treat me like Roomate’s then they’ll have to start acting like it.

Then today, my sil starts doing more petty things, to inconvenience my day , so I told her I’m not going to be paying half the rent, and that if she smokes anymore I’ll get cps involved with her kid, I text my brother the same thing and he didn’t respond.

So a couple weeks go by, me and Marie get pretty close, watching anime and bonding through demon slayer (nothing like you’re thinking perverts) on the second weekend of her being here he starts throwing her stuff out onto the lawn, so my sil, marie and I are all wondering what’s going on, so we put all of her stuff into a safe location and we go out for the day, (just me and Marie and one of my friends) halfway through our day Marie gets pretty upset over something, I’m not sure what it was, and she wouldn’t say what it was, so we just went home
When we arrive she says she has to be out by tonight (sent by a text through my sil) and ofc she doesn’t tell me why either, so we pack the rest of her belongings and help her move in to her relatives house, (i proceed to help her by helping to move her things with my truck, let her use a laptop of mine for school, doing as much as i can so she can have a head start getting her life together).

Another week goes by and they start acting petty to me, my brother doesn’t say anything to me, (he doesn’t even talk to his wife very much, yes they just sit there and stare at eachother sometimes). My sil starts sending me texts demanding that I don’t bring Marie over and states she doesn’t care if we remain friends, and a bunch of other things small enough not to be mentioned, if she were to ask I wouldn’t have cared as much as I do, so I call my brother and tell him if he doesn’t get his ducks in a row I won’t be paying for half of the extra room, that I’ll only pay for my room, 1/3 of the rent, if they want to treat me like Roomate’s then they’ll have to start acting like it.

Then today, my sil starts doing more petty things, to inconvenience my day , so I told her I’m not going to be paying half the rent, and that if she smokes anymore I’ll get cps involved with her kid, I text my brother the same thing and he didn’t respond. I said this because I gave them a second chance to figure it out, but they don’t seem to want to listen, I’m not sure what I should do in this situation, aita?",0.0,0.022931808605790138,0,1

On the day of we decided to get together and get brunch, at brunch abby was talking about how she was moving in with her longtime boyfriend and they were getting a cat together. I was so excited for them, I love cats and none of my other friends have pets so its nice to have someone to talk to them about. I was telling her cats are the best and I'm sure she will love hers. Also saying I love laying with mine and kissing him on his cute little forehead. She told me that was disgusting.  
  
I was shocked and had no idea what to say. She followed that up by saying she would never kiss an animal, that was gross. Atp I was mad, and responded with ""But your boyfriend kisses you?"".

Subjects: my brother (30M), and I (28FTM), and my parents.

Side facts: 
- my brother has autism, the Asperger’s spectrum of it.
- My brother and I both love anime (I’m just emo and he’s more “normal”).
- My dad is a pilot.
- Family likes to have one room for the parents and one room for my brother and I since we are still “kids” to them.

Story:
So my family wanted to do a family vacation for my brother’s 30th birthday (when it’s now approaching his 31st) and he wanted to go out of country. So we went to a European nation and it’s beautiful. It’s just super busy so it’s been overwhelming my head since I’m not good with people and crowds.

So we get here and we get to our hotel and the first few days and then I hear my brother breathing weird  and I never really thought much about it before since I always associated it with him having autism and he’s different than me. (Listen, I don’t know if I have autism too, I just know I’m not the same as my brother).

Eventually I ask him what he’s reading and he’s like “a story” and I don’t know what kind so I push it until I hear it’s an “isekai”. I tried to find out the title but he wouldn’t tell me. Later in the hotel room, I see he’s jerking himself off and that’s why he’s breathing so weirdly.

I don’t know if he’s been always doing this or not when he breathes weirdly since I’ve always been distracted with art or video games or what not but it disturbed me and made me overthink since I have the tendency to do that.

Recently i’ve started to get more and more worried about how my life is going, although i think i’m quite successful school has always been a struggle for me. I’m in my second to last year of HS and am earning my associates degree as well, it has not been easy at all.

My boyfriend is the opposite, total brainiac and math whiz. He aces everything he does and i’m so proud of him. He does a lot of activities and classes and test scores that look attractive to colleges. Since we are so close to senior year, there has been more talking about college and life after high school. We’ve never really discussed it before, but he’s started taking college tours and telling me about a lot of full ride scholarships over the phone. Never really in person. I don’t have star test scores or anything that will get me any kind of scholarships worth while.

Today seniors leave two weeks earlier than everyone else, and while saying final goodbyes a senior my boyfriend is friends with started talking to him about colleges. It’s like it became real, how much better he was, and how everything was going to change soon. we haven’t discussed our relationship out of highschool, very honestly neither of us thought we’d be together through the end, we’ve been dating since middle school and are still very happy.

Anyways, while they were talking I was just standing by and listening to what they were saying and my stomach just started to turn.

150,1coio53,AITA For Asking My Father to Not Give my Nephew a Toy?,"This is going to be a long one so bare with me. I (f23) live with my parents, my older sister, my younger sister, and younger sister´s boyfriend and 3 year old son. My dad does NOT like my sisters boyfriend and does everything he can to undermine what he says when it comes to raising my nephew. Now the boyfriend isn´t his biological dad, only stepdad so that plays a big part in why he doesnt like him. My sister and her boyfriend both agreed on him being the disciplinarian of the two and my dad does not like that.

So now that I´ve gotten a little background down i´ll explain why I might be the asshole. Two days ago me and my family go to Savers and I buy my nephew a big school bus that he instantly loves. He held it the whole time we were there and in the car. Now his bedtime is 9pm and we were out still at 830 so i went home to make dinner so by the time they were done it would be ready. The boyfriend is kinda upset because he has the overnight shift and he leaves at 930 and he needs to put my nephew to bed. When they get home around 9 the boyfriend goes down and gets him out of the car and leaves the school bus saying its time to eat and he can have it tomorrow.

This makes my dad PISSED. How dare he take it away. And of course because it was taken away my nephew was crying/screaming. So we give him a tablet and a bunch of stuff and he calms down. And the boyfriend hides it so that my nephew wouldn´t see it. By the time he calms down its 930 so the boyfriend asks me if I can put him to bed and of course I said yes. So once he leaves my dad immediately goes and looks for it. He´s pissed when he can´t find it and starts to go in their room to look for it. I realize what he´s doing and I ask him if he could please stop because if he gives it to him again he´s gonna get upset and its almost bedtime. My dad explodes and he starts throwing the food that I had made for him. Saying he needs to start doing something before he hurts someone. Now I left the room at this point because I needed to be alone or I would have exploded too. I put my nephew to bed and let my dad give him a kiss and everything. My dad immediately went to bed after that while i was laying my nephew down.

He has barely talked to me since and everyone else has told me i was not in the wrong. I kinda agree with them but i question if I should have just let him give it to him. AITA?

edit: The reasons I didn´t want him to give my nephew the toy was #1 that it´s from Savers it´s dirty and my nephew was in a booster seat which means it would be on the kitchen table. #2 the first time the bus was taken away we had all these things to give him to get him to calm down but this time it would be time for bed and i wouldn´t have the time to give him stuff to calm him down. he would have put up a fight and i didn´t want to deal with that.

Recently, our maternal grandmother ""Mabel"" passed away. My parents cut her off nearly a decade ago, as my mother never had a great relationship with her due to emotional abuse suffered in her childhood.  Not too long after that me and my siblings went low/no contact with her as well, me in particular because of her racist tendencies knowing full well I have a diverse friend group. Roughly five years ago, Mabel realized she couldn't take care of herself anymore, and I learnt through my extended family that despite her significant savings, she refused to check into a nursing/retirement home, majorly because of the ""foreigners"" that work there.

My mother had completely burnt all bridges with Mabel, so Mabel tried guilt-tripping me and my siblings into taking care of her. Jane, Jack and I refused quickly, but Sophie broke down. If I'm being candid, Sophie has the tendency to be a bit of a pushover, which is why Mabel probably got to her fairly easily.

When Mabel passed, we learnt that in her will, she had left some money to my mother, but left the majority of her savings and her sizeable house to Sophie. Her savings were significant, amounting to the high six-figures. I felt that it was only right Sophie received a hefty inheritance, as did Jane and our parents, but Jack disagreed. He thinks that it's ""only right"" that the four of us receive an equal inheritance, and is trying to pressure Sophie. I wholeheartedly think the opposite for a few reasons. Number one, despite the person she was, Mabel had the right to grant her inheritance to whoever she desired. Number two, Sophie put up with her for five years, and deserves the world for that. Many times I checked in with her and she looked about to crumble, constantly under emotional duress.

Jane agrees with me, but refused to speak to Jack at all, as she shut him down pretty quickly. The reason I'm asking here is because I'm in a pretty good position financially. I'm by no means flying off to Europe twice a year, but I'm stable, so an inheritance wouldn't benefit me that much.

153,1coih5s,AITA for my response to my dad?,"I (f21) lost my mom to cancer back in 2020. This obviously devastated both me and my dad (m59) and we ended up becoming very close afterwards. In 2022, my dad started dating Alayna (f56). Alayna lives two hours away from my dad and has three children of her own. I have met her and she’s extremely sweet. 

Around that time, I moved 9 hours away to live with my boyfriend (m22). I would come home and stay at my dad’s house for a few days every few months whenever my boyfriend and I could get the time off work. However, I started to notice a pattern. Every time I would come visit my dad, he would only spend a day with me then would ask my boyfriend and I to watch his dog so he could stay at Alayna’s house for the rest of the time. It bothered me a little bit because I was there to see him but I let it go because I was just glad he’s happy. 

In 2023, I found out that my dad had been cheating on Alayna with an old friend and it really upset me because Alayna is such a sweetheart. My dad just expected me to keep the secret (which is a whole different moral dilemma) but not the point. I brought up how awful the cheating was and how much he had been hurting my feelings by spending the entire time with Alayna when I visit but he just dismissed my feelings. 

Last month was my breaking point. My boyfriend and I went up to see him and he once again asked us to watch his dog so he could stay at Alayna’s house all week. I asked him if they could stay at his house until we left but he said no. I just agreed and spent my time visiting family. The last night we were there, he finally came home but he just asked us to leave the house for a few hours so he could see the girl he was cheating on Alayna with. 

I was really upset and we left. The weekend after we left, he started posting on facebook. He took Alayna and her kids to some fancy hotel and a baseball game and spent the entire weekend with them. I was livid. I texted him expressing how much that hurt my feelings since I had spent the past year begging him to spend more than one day with me. Instead of apologizing, he turned it around on me. I ended up telling him to leave me alone and go be with his new family and that he wouldn’t have to worry about me anymore cause I was done. I told him I wouldn’t be coming home anymore indefinitely and that I didn’t want to speak with him.

He ended up telling my family what I said and I got texts from them telling me that I was way too harsh and that I needed to apologize to my dad. They told me that he does so much for me and I should be happy that he found someone. They also mentioned that I can’t expect my dad to spend all his time with me when I come up there. I can see where they’re coming from since I was pretty harsh but I feel like I was always happy for him, I was just tired of being pushed aside so much. He would make some attempt to see me for maybe a day but that was it and he had also dismissed me every time I tried to bring it up. Was I too harsh with what I said? AITA? 
",Not the A-hole,2024-05-10,"AITA for my response to my dad? I (f21) lost my mom to cancer back in 2020. This obviously devastated both me and my dad (m59) and we ended up becoming very close afterwards. In 2022, my dad started dating Alayna (f56). Alayna lives two hours away from my dad and has three children of her own. I have met her and she’s extremely sweet. 

Around that time, I moved 9 hours away to live with my boyfriend (m22). I would come home and stay at my dad’s house for a few days every few months whenever my boyfriend and I could get the time off work. However, I started to notice a pattern. Every time I would come visit my dad, he would only spend a day with me then would ask my boyfriend and I to watch his dog so he could stay at Alayna’s house for the rest of the time.

155,1coi8k7,AITA for bringing a generic product vs the name brand I was asked to bring?,"This seems so silly to me but it became such a big deal, I have to ask.

Last weekend, my girlfriend’s family hosted a BBQ. I was always raised to never show up anywhere empty-handed, so I asked my girlfriend’s mom what I could bring. She asked that I grab the Cool Whip for a dessert she was making.. Easy enough. I figured it won’t be hard to find, so, I decide to wait until morning of to grab it on my way there.

Well, I get to the store about 20 minutes before the BBQ starts and they’re somehow out of the name brand. They did, however, have the store brand’s “whipped topping”. As I didn’t have time to go to another grocery store, I just bought the generic brand and headed off.
Upon arrival, I hand the bag to my girlfriend’s mom. She opens it, looks inside and gets a weird look on her face. She asks where the Cool Whip is. I say the store was out, but this is pretty much the same thing, right? She looks a little irritated with me but just tells me to make myself at home. As I’m putting my stuff down, I hear her asking her husband to r un to the store and grab the Cool Whip. I can’t hear the entire conversation, but he must have asked didn’t I bring it because I then hear her say “I asked for one thing and he couldn’t even deliver”. 

Nothing else was said directly to me, but there were a few passive-aggressive remarks throughout the BBQ. Such as when her husband arrived, name brand in hand, calling him her “hero”. When the dessert was served, she again made a comment about how it’s made with “real Cool Whip”. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I took it on the chin.

When talking to my girlfriend about it later, she said that her mom was overdramatic but I should’ve called her to ask if generic was okay. Or I could’ve gone to a different store. I asked if there was really a difference and she said she doesn’t know, but it was what I was asked to bring, so I should’ve communicated better.
Again, this all sound so stupid but…am I the asshole?

156,1coi7o9,AITA for refusing to pay my mortgage after my father gave my siblings some money?,"I(31F), purchased a house 7 years ago. My father shared 50% of the downplayment only. Since then, my father has been the only one living in that house. I have never seen that house in person. Have never even took a single step on that property in the whole 7 years. But I, alone, is the one paying the monthly mortgage. Since I work in a different country, my payments go through my grandmother and she does all the payments for me. 
Fast forward to a couple of months ago, my father decided to sell our old house(not my house), which was his inheritance from my grandma. He didn't tell me about it, his half-sister did. So, I contacted my father and told him I knew about him selling the house and I have nothing against it. But I did adviced him not to give money to my siblings cause they have never helped him anyway. I don't want any part of that money as well. I specifically told him to keep the money all to himself. Maybe he can take my grandma on a vacation or start up his own business or something. 
He disagreed and told me he will do whatever he wants with his money. He said, he will give each of the 3 of us siblings equal shares. I told him fine, do whatever he wants, but I don't want his money. He then proceeds to tell me that I won't be getting any anyway because my share will be use to pay up the money I owe him. Meaning, the money he paid for half of the downpayment. I was in shock and confused because I thought we had an agreement that we will both pay the downpayment and I continue with the monthly. Turns out, he decided that wasn't the case anymore. So I told him, ""Alright then. Since you don't have any share on my house, and you have all this money, then please leave my house cause I will be renting it to someone who will actually pay to stay"". He got mad and told me how ungrateful I am. That if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have gotten the house in the first place. Which wasn't true cause I am very much capable of paying the whole downpayment. I just let him pay half cause he was the one who offered, so he could stay in my house. 
I told him, ""Since I already paid you with my share from selling the old house, and you refuse to leave my house, then you'll have to start paying rent. And I'm also gonna need you to pay 7 years worth of rent. Now that you have all that money, you should be able to afford the rent, plus your 7 years balance"" He went silent. I told him I'm not gonna be sending any more money and if he won't leave, then he pay the mortgage. If he decides to leave, I will rent out the house and the rent payments will cover the mortgage. But from now on, no money will be transferring from my account to their's. 
So, AITA?

158,1cohvxo,AITA for not warning my wife about my ass rag?,"Okay, context. My wife is weird about butt stuff. I'm not talking about sexual butt stuff, that's obviously personal and up to the individual. I mean her unwillingness to acknowledge that anything comes out of butts or that people even have buttholes.

When we bought our house, I wanted to install a bidet, but my wife was against it. I told her she doesn't have to use it but she said just seeing it would gross her out. I mentioned not feeling clean just from wiping with paper and she didn't understand. Not everyone has naturally hairless assholes that barely require wiping! She asked if I could find an alternative. I said I could use wet wipes, but they're not flushable (none of them are BTW) so they'd have to go in the trash. She didn't like the idea of poopy things in the trash can, and told me to figure something else out that she didn't have to know about.

So, onto my ass rag. I took an old towel, tore it up, and installed a discreet hook behind the toilet to hang the rag. It's completely hidden. The way our bathroom is set up (we only have one), the sink is right next to the toilet. So I'm able to wet the rag, clean up, wash it in the sink, and hang it back up. I swap it out a couple times a week. Gross? Maybe. But I figured that's my business since my wife did not want to hear about my butthole cleaning habits.

Recently my wife and I were showering together and she forgot to bring in a washcloth for herself. I don't use one, I use a sisal pouch with bar soap. I offered to hop out and grab her a washcloth, but she said, ""No, don't worry about it, I'll just use yours!"" and reached for my ass rag. I said you don't want to use that. She asked why. I said just trust me. She kept pushing.

So I came clean about my ass rag. She was horrified, started dry-heaving, and kicked me out of the shower. Apparently she had been using it as a washcloth for years whenever she forgot hers, which is often. What I don't get is how she thought that was my washcloth because A) It's hidden behind the frikkin' toilet and B) She knows I don't use a washcloth. We got into an argument. From my perspective, it was obvious that my ass rag wasn't a washcloth, all bets are off when you use someone else's shit without asking, and her butthole hangup is interfering with my personal hygiene. From her perspective, I violated a clear boundary she set years ago and I'm just an overall gross person. I did apologize but I was upset and my apology wasn't really sincere.

I'm sleeping on the couch right now to try and give her some space. But I'd like to know if I owe her a more sincere apology over this ass rag fiasco. I'm really not sure and her reaction has me thinking that maybe I actually am disgusting and I'm lacking the perspective to see it.

159,1cohs5m,WIBTA for asking my roommate to have her boyfriend over less often?,"My roommate’s room is directly above mine and our walls, ceilings, and floors are very thin. She knows this very well as she’s been stressed for a long time about our neighbors’ noise right next to our unit.

The issue is… my roommate just started dating and  brings her boyfriend over 5-6 nights out of the week. I really don’t have any problem with this since they are very quiet and keep to themselves, and I rarely run into him. But whenever the boyfriend is over, the footsteps and bed squeaks become a lot more frequent and they go to bed around 1am-2am. I could also hear talking and laughing. FYI, I AM a sensitive sleeper so I need pretty much silence when I sleep. I texted her twice and politely asked if they could keep it down only during quiet hours (10pm-8am) and that I do not mind noises during the day. She agreed and the conversation ended very amicably, but the problem has not been solved.

Now I am considering asking her to have her boyfriend over maybe 2-3 times a week instead of almost everyday so that I am not disturbed by the footsteps, bed squeaks, etc. every night. Would this be a reasonable request or do I need to suck it up for being such a sensitive sleeper?

1- in the next two-three weeks, 
2- a wedding Ive been asking for an invitation for, and 3- just a side note- I’m not a photographer. 

I told my friend no- I’m uncomfortable with that. I’m not professional and she understood. 

THE VERY NEXT DAY I get a text via Facebook from the bride with an invite to the wedding. 

Bride- 12:50pm “My wedding is at *this place* at 2 in *this town*. 
At the moment I can’t seem to find the few invites I have. The food is either 1st choice, second, third. Lmk if you and *husbands name* are coming and what y’all want to eat “

I read the text. Thought it was sorta a rude.  But whatever ima go about my day and later I took a nap and woke up to 

Bride- 6:22pm “good talk”

Brides mom- 7:41 pm “*bride* is getting upset you aren’t responding to her text regarding the wedding. She can she that you read the text but don’t respond. We need an answer on whether you and *husband* are coming and what your food choices are. We have to get the numbers in. 

At this point I did respond. To the bride. With a 😂. And she came back with “I didn’t know I said anything funny” 

My final response- “I had texted your sister after your initial invite asking if something was wrong. The wording and how you invited me just really made me feel like you didn’t really want me there. I figured I was being sensitive and so I took a nap. I then woke up to another text that made me think you had an attitude. Not that i need to explain myself, but I was waiting for my husband to get home to ask him what he wanted. You gave me six hours and a whole lot of attitude and for that I will not be attending. 

Her mom texts “ that’s fucked up”

I was also going through infertility at that time and was going through a lot with my mental and physical health. It not the fact that it was on facebook or last minute. It was how it was done. I felt like I was wanted when I could photograph. But I said no. So I get this fb invite and a six hour time frame and attitude from the bride and mom. Am I supposed to be celebrating you? Bc I feel like y’all hate me. Am I the asshole? 

",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-10,"AITA The Facebook wedding invite There once was a family that took me in. I was in high school. Forever indebted to them- I was their free babysitter, painter, taxi, baker and now photographer? Over the past 20 years I’ve gone above and beyond for this family that helped me as a teenager. And take advantage- they did. Since Covid and infertility- I learned to stop letting people walk all over me. I stand up for myself.  This family had a toxic mom and daughter duo.

162,1cohe1s,AITA For Not Wanting to Go to My GF’s Friends Wedding,"I (25,M) am invited to my GF’s (25,F) friend’s wedding in June but I had realized that the wedding is the same day as my workplace’s golf tournament.

I have my work’s yearly golf tournament the same day as my GF’s friend’s wedding that I was really looking forward to playing in with my friends. I have signed up for a team already because I didn’t realize the wedding was the same day.

Her friend’s wedding is about 2 hours away in a town that she’s from and we would have to stay overnight in a hotel due to the wedding’s schedule. I haven’t ever actually met her or her fiancé. I only know of her friend because we went to university at the same time and were in the same program. I had some of the same classes as her previously but haven’t actually talked to her before. I am quite confident I wouldn’t know anyone there either. My GF and I have been together for 5 years and I don’t ever recall them hanging out before but I know she’s always considered her as a friend. 

I am assuming the right thing to do is to suck it up and go to the wedding but would I be an asshole to 
consider not going to the wedding? I haven’t really been to many weddings so I don’t know if it would be a really disrespectful excuse to not go. On the other hand, if it is something that’s not a big deal to skip then I would like to know lol. I am fine with having to skip the golf tournament but just wanted some opinions.

164,1cogzxb,AITA for my husband's appointment falling through,"My husband (39) asked me (36) to ensure that a very important scheduled appointment by an inspector was seen through at our cabin. I'm at our cabin, setting up for the summer, while he's running the company that supports us, a state away. He told me several times how important if was that I have all the documentation organized for when the inspector came.

This is the information he gave me:

1. The inspector works at a maintenance and rental shop here in the local boondocks.
2. The inspector can come to our property in the evening after they get off work.
3. The inspector gets off work at 4pm so call them to confirm that they are coming.
4. I texted my husband asking for their phone number, which he sent.
5. We live in the boondocks and folks here hold multiple odd-jobs. I assumed that their after-hours vin check business was totally separate from their day job. I thought it similar to a public notary position. I interpreted that them getting off work at 4pm was noted so to confirm with them AFTER they finished work and could talk.
6. At 4:22pm I called and texted the number given to me by my husband. I discovered that the number was for the maintenance shop, now freshly closed, and NOT their personal number. Ultimately the inspector failed to show up to the scheduled appointment at our cabin and my husband blames me because I didn't confirm with the inspector during the maintenance shop hours.

He believes I didn't care, when I literally had an alarm set for 3:55 to call the inspector after they got off work. I revolved my day around what he said was important. Full disclosure, I have a history of being lazy and letting him down, but I told him recently that I was going to be a better wife to him. He’s always been patient with and supportive of me and doesn’t ask anything in return. So when he expressed that this was important and I was enthusiastic to step up. This huge fight feels weird because I don't know what I would have done differently with the same information.

169,1cogp7y,AITA for being mad my friends didn't say anything about graduation? ,"I (25 F) graduated from law school Sunday. To date, this is my biggest day: I'm not married or anything, so I haven't had any other real big days (except undergrad graduation, which attendance was limited for COVID). My best friends (27 F, 29 M) have known about my graduation for 2 years: it's always the first weekend of May. They got invited to a wedding last summer that would be on May 4th,  and have told me they would skip it because they would have to fly to it and they wanted to be at my graduation on May 5th. They are engaged and getting married in June. 27 F's Bach trip was last weekend, and I went. She and some bridesmaids were upset that I had to  work while on the trip (it was a court deadline, I could not have moved the work).



On our ride back from the Bach trip on Sunday (1 week before graduation), 27 F asked me if I could watch their dog (who cannot be left alone for more than 2 hours) over graduation weekend because they were going to the wedding. She said they would try to be back in time for graduation. I said no: I had family coming to stay with me, and I wanted to enjoy getting to spend time with my friends and family before I start bar prep. Later that week (Wed), they tried to get other help and asked me to cover times. I agreed to watch the dog on Thursday night, but my family was coming Friday so I could not stay after. They said that was fine, but asked if I could check on it Sunday after graduation. They would not get into town that night: flight landed at 6 pm. I realized they would be unable to make it to graduation at 2.



Sunday comes, I've graduated. I've heard nothing from either of them. I text 27 F and say ""I'm a J.D. now!"" and follow up with another text that I would get something I left at her house later. I got ""Okay!"" No congratulations or acknowledgement that I had graduated, even though just over a week before, they were telling me they would be there. I read the message and don't respond. I get nothing for two days, until Wed. 27 F asks me to come to an event she's hosting Sat, even though I am now in bar prep and have said my days Mon-Sat are busy. I don't respond because I am studying. She calls me twice (while I'm still studying, my phone is on DND so I don't see it), then sends me a voice memo. She asks me to go over to her house and sign for a package because they mistook the delivery days. After studying, it was late (after 11), so I just sent a text that said ""I just finished studying. Let me know a definite time, but I'll probably be asleep."" She just liked the message. She texted me again today, letting me know the package was delivered with no problem. I didn't respond, and don't plan to.



AITA for being upset they didn't come to my graduation after telling me they would, or at least acknowledge it after I'd graduated?

AITA for not responding/being accommodating to their requests, even after they didn't acknowledge my big day?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-10,"AITA for being mad my friends didn't say anything about graduation?  I (25 F) graduated from law school Sunday. To date, this is my biggest day: I'm not married or anything, so I haven't had any other real big days (except undergrad graduation, which attendance was limited for COVID). My best friends (27 F, 29 M) have known about my graduation for 2 years: it's always the first weekend of May. They got invited to a wedding last summer that would be on May 4th,  and have told me they would skip it because they would have to fly to it and they wanted to be at my graduation on May 5th. They are engaged and getting married in June. 27 F's Bach trip was last weekend, and I went. She and some bridesmaids were upset that I had to  work while on the trip (it was a court deadline, I could not have moved the work).



On our ride back from the Bach trip on Sunday (1 week before graduation), 27 F asked me if I could watch their dog (who cannot be left alone for more than 2 hours) over graduation weekend because they were going to the wedding. She said they would try to be back in time for graduation. I said no: I had family coming to stay with me, and I wanted to enjoy getting to spend time with my friends and family before I start bar prep. Later that week (Wed), they tried to get other help and asked me to cover times. I agreed to watch the dog on Thursday night, but my family was coming Friday so I could not stay after. They said that was fine, but asked if I could check on it Sunday after graduation. They would not get into town that night: flight landed at 6 pm. I realized they would be unable to make it to graduation at 2.

170,1cogm2a,AITA for not buying my brother thing since he’s unemployed,"I (21M) live with my mom and my brother (20M). Out of everyone in the household, my mom and I have jobs, while my brother does not, and has never had one; and seems to show no interest in getting one at all, and for some reason, my mom tolerates this.

For me, this is extremely irritating because he has no mental issues that could stop him from holding a job, plus he is not physically disabled as well! The only thing potentially holding him back would be his lack of a driver's license (which is another story in itself) but there are many places around us that he could walk to to get a job.

Because of this, I refuse to buy things for him. For example, if I go out to buy fast food I don’t offer to buy him anything, or if he asks me to get something for him I tell him to pay me back for the food with the money he occasionally gets from our parents (after I tell him that he usually tells me he’s not hungry anymore, lol). Or when I buy myself groceries I tell him not to use my stuff since he didn’t contribute to the purchase of them (which he respects, thank god).

I do this because in my head, me buying things for him only further incentivizes him to not get a job. Especially when my mom allows him to live with us rent-free because of his lack of income, while I have to pay my share of rent and a portion of some household bills, plus my own stuff (phone bill, car insurance, etc.)! And I feel as though buying stuff for him would be coddling him when he is a grown-ass man who is just as capable as the rest of us!

My mom disagrees with this and believes that I am being a “horrible”, “selfish”, and “greedy” brother for not buying him things. Meanwhile, she will buy him anything he needs (food, clothes, etc.)!

This has put a serious strain on my relationship with my mom and brother to the point where we have had multiple serious arguments about money, and my behavior toward my brother, and it’s starting to make me wonder if I’m just being a dick.

So tell me Reddit, am I being the asshole for not buying things for my brother?

171,1cogina,AITAH for putting my foot down on my daughter and me visiting my boyfriends dad’s home. ,"  I (20F) have been dating my (21M) boyfriend for over a year now. Since the beginning if my boyfriend doesn’t do something his father likes he will do petty things to “punish” him. I have multiple examples of this but I will give you the most recent one. 
  My boyfriend works for a company that does a lot of out of town work, which makes it hard for us to keep up with our relationship especially with a 4 month old. This company also tells their employees that they can bring their wives/husbands out of town with them. Well I decided to go out of town with him, and because we had left our daughter with his dad’s ex wife. His dad called my boyfriends mom complaining, “I never see the baby..blah blah blah.” Which was definitely not true at the time, now is. 
  He then proceeded to tell my boyfriend to come in on Monday morning for a “talk.” He tells him that its unacceptable that I’m going with them out of town as well as almost firing him over this. 
  I talk to multiple of the other workers who then proceeded to tell me that they had told them “you can bring your wives and kids with you if you want.” So its just me who he does not want out with the guys. I have talked to multiple family members who all say he is trying to punish us for not letting him see the baby. 
  I put my foot down and said then no more, you will not see your grandkid until you can act like an adult. AITAH? Or is this reasonable for me to be upset for being punished?

I told my grandma not to worry because we were still going to stick with the original plan. But then my mother went around telling her family and friends about how I was ungrateful for refusing to spend time with her on mother's day.

174,1coga19,AITA for asking to see my dad if he was gonna help pay for my college?,"Ok, so there a lot of lore to get through but I’ll try to make it quick as possible. For most of our childhood, my brother (14M) and I (18F) saw our dad two evenings per week and every other weekend. At first, things were great then he married my stepmom, Tracy, and everything go so much worse. 

Tracy made my dad’s house hell. She cussed me out almost every time I was there. She told me I wouldn’t care if my dad died. She insulted me constantly. She said my fav hobby (art) was “an excuse to sit around and be lazy.” She threatened to physically harm my brother as a “joke.” There is much more but character limit, so let me just say when I told a counselor about the extent of it she said if I kept talking she would have to report them for child abuse. 

I turned 13 and couldn’t take another day. While my dad was alone, I told him I had something important to say and asked “Dad, I’m getting older and was wondering if maybe I could come for evenings but not weekends anymore?”He shut me down and refused to talk about it. I tried again, same result. So, I went to my mom about it. She supported me because I had told her what I’d dealt with there. So, my mom and I asked him again. He got extremely defensive and accursed us of “ganging up on him.” He left in a huff. 

He saw me a handful of times after that, never at the house.  Then, nothing for years. Not even a call on my birthday. Then, a year ago, he began showing up. After a few months, he told me he wanted to talk about “it.” When I brought up Tracy being a huge part in “it”. He told me not to talk about her and we all made mistakes. He blames the pandemic for him not contacting me or being involved in my life but that was over a year past at this point.

Now, I am 18. We are invited to a family dinner for the first time in 4+ years. I take a private walk with my dad. I ask him if he has a college savings for me. Per the divorce agreement, he was supposed to continue putting money monthly into my savings account. I already know he did not, he took some from mine and gave it my brother’s account then closed the account. He avoided the question and instead badgered me about what college I was going to.

My dad called the next day. He wanted control over which college I chose. Still, not telling if he would help financially. We argued. Then, he said something to the affect of I shouldn’t have the audacity to bring up this topic. It came to a boiling point and He said he didn’t know if he could ever forgive me what I did. What I did being ask to do evenings not weekends all those years ago which snowballed into not really seeing him at all for 3 ish years. I don’t really care if he helps pay for college or not. I don’t think he should either. His words hurt the most. I did what I thought was best. I was 13 and in a horrible situation and it was taking a toll on my brother’s and I’s mental health.
