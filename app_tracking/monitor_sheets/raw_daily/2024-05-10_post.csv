0,1coythp,WIBTA for telling my mum I don't want to interact with her boyfriend ,"My mum (55F) has had a boyfriend for maybe three years now, who I (20M) have never gotten along with. I tried to be civil, but he's someone who you either have to be overly friendly with or ignore flat out- he tries to speak to you and will repeat himself again and again until you laugh and agree with him.

That doesn't make him awful I guess (just fucking annoying,) but he also has a pattern of really creepy behaviour. I often have friends stay round mine after a night out, and every single girl who I've brought back has confided afterwards that he made them uncomfortable. (Overly familiar/complimenting, if not borderline aggressive to their partners if I had a houseparty or something)

He's also made me uncomfortable a lot- I'm a transgender man, but before I started hormones and started to actually look like a man, he was far too close with me even when I was visibly uncomfortable. He doesn't do that anymore, but still calls me a girl half the time even though I now have a mustache lol.

I really just wanted to ignore him, because I know my mum won't take it well- she has a history of ignoring shit like this, and I'm a university student now so I don't actually live with her at least 3/4 of the year.

Question is, WIBTA if I told her I don't want her boyfriend around when I'm at home? It'd cause a massive rift in their relationship, and I'm not around for most of the year so I don't know if it's worth it/fair on her (she's been single for a long time and had basically accepted that being the case for the rest of her life.) I also know she wouldn't be receptive to me saying anything, so it would cause a massive argument between us.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-05-10,"WIBTA for telling my mum I don't want to interact with her boyfriend  My mum (55F) has had a boyfriend for maybe three years now, who I (20M) have never gotten along with.

1,1cows6q,"AITA for ""grounding"" my adult sister? (UPDATE)","Before I start this update, I want to recommend reading my comments on my previous post. There were many questions that I was able to answer there.

It's very hard to explain my relationship with my younger sister in proper detail, but I will say that, while I love her dearly, Mia has always been a very inconsiderate person.

I have countless examples. She almost didn't attend our cousin's wedding last year because she didn't want to walk to the venue (which was two blocks away from our mom's place). We shared a bathroom when we were younger, and she'd insist on having the top drawers because she ""didn't want to crouch down"", but she was cool with me doing so. She slept through my college graduation, and didn't apologize for it.

I'm bringing this up now because whenever I asked Mia why she kept forgetting to use her key, her excuse was that looking through her bag took too long and the keypad was quicker. In her head, bothering other people is better than slightly inconveniencing herself.

After I established the curfew, Mia tried different ways to make me change my mind. She'd talk about not being able to cancel her tickets for Party X, or about the fun her friends had at Party Y. She'd show me her ""developing"" LinkedIn profile, and tell me she had learned her lesson and would be more responsible.

At first, I really didn't want to have to kick her out (which many of you suggested), but I have limits. A few days ago, I heard her complaining to her friends on the phone about her ""bitch of a sister"" who wouldn't let her do anything.

Later that day, I asked her which of our parents she planned on moving in with. Cue more fighting.

I managed to tell her that I had no obligation to continue housing her (for free!) if she couldn't respect my family. Mia could either move back in with our parents or continue living with me for the low price of respecting my infant son and stop complaining about it.

We did have a very productive conversation afterwards. I managed to get a lot off my chest, as did my sister. Mia apologized for everything. She admitted she'd been selfish, promised she'd make efforts to change and mature.

I'm a strong believer that people can change, which is why I'm not kicking her out right now. But I made it very clear that Mia is on thin ice, and the next time she does anything like this will be the last time she ever sees the inside of my home.

The curfew will continue until the end of the semester, as originally planned. My father also agreed to pay for Mia to go back to therapy. It helped her a lot when she was younger, so I'm hopeful about the future of this living situation.

I also want to thank those who suggested a white noise machine. My son is not a light sleeper, the keypad is just very loud and startles him awake, but my fiancé and I are still looking into getting one. Anything that helps our baby sleep better is welcome.

2,1cog1eb,WIBTA for not inviting my younger (12M) half-brother to my wedding and being completely honest about why?,"My fiancé (24F) and I (27M) are getting married in November and we had a mutual agreement that we would have an adult only wedding. My mom, however, thinks I should invite my younger half brother (12M) (we’ll call him Mark) to our wedding. She brought it up 2 weeks ago and we told her our rule and she suggested we still invite him because “he’s your brother and it would make your grandparents happy.” We both disagree. 

Now here’s some backstory before anybody asks: 
Mark is my dad’s only other son after me. Dad ran off when I was a kid, started a family, had Mark with then wife, then ran off again. My paternal grandparents got close to Mark and his mom and now the kid spends a lot of time with them. I feel like even tho I grew up with my grandparents for some time well before Mark was born, I don’t feel obligated to have any sort of relationship with my brother, I’ve only seen him 4 times in my life and 2 out of the 4 he was a baby. Huge age gap and we live like 8 states away. 

Back to the story. My mom sounded pretty upset and told me I had to tell my grandparents. I called them and said the invitation would only be for the two of them because we had a limited guest list…. Which is true but not the real reason. They understood. Now this is where it can all come back to haunt us and could make me the AH. We recently changed the location of the ceremony which would allow more guests if we wanted to but haven’t told my mom or grandparents.

This evening, i was doing just that. I noticed somebody getting out of the passenger side of a sedan, with civilian license plates. He was dressed business casual, had mirrored pilot sunglasses, and a clipboard. Of course, the car was parked illegally, partially blocking the driveway to the rooming house.

I was wondering if he was selling something, or what. Then he started up the sidewalk and up the stairs i was sitting atop. Approaching me, he asked if i lived here. I said yes. He asked if i mind letting him in. I replied, “yes. I do mind.”
He claimed to be a police officer, just “wanting to talk to somebody.” 
They always say that. 
I asked if he had a warrant. He said no. I suggested he call whoever it was he wanted to talk to and have them let him in.
He said he didn’t have a phone number, and told me, “you don’t have to be an a$$hole about it.” To which i replied, that i don’t appreciate being called an a—hole. Rather than apologize, he doubled down, saying that i was being uncooperative.
Such entitlement. 
This guy is a passenger in a civilian car and out of uniform. The only things that might identify him as a police officer were the radio on his belt, the badge around his neck, and his lousy entitled attitude.
I don’t even open the door for friends of friends. Sure, i see you visit my friend, regularly. But i can’t know if you’ve had a fight and aren’t here as a friend, this time.
So, i asked for his badge number. He said it as a full number, then the 3 individual digits, then, with a snide tone, asked me if i want him to write it down. To which i replied, “i may be an a—hole, but i’m not a dumb F—ing C…”
He had the audacity to tell me that i shouldn’t call myself an A hole. To which i responded, “no, i should leave that to you.”
After he left, unable to gain access to the building, rather than calm myself and head to the store, i went back inside and emailed the DOJ, since i live in a city who’s PD is under investigation, they have a dedicated email address, for our PD.

I was wondering if he was selling something, or what. Then he started up the sidewalk and up the stairs i was sitting atop. Approaching me, he asked if i lived here. I said yes. He asked if i mind letting him in. I replied, “yes. I do mind.”
He claimed to be a police officer, just “wanting to talk to somebody.” 
They always say that. 
I asked if he had a warrant. He said no. I suggested he call whoever it was he wanted to talk to and have them let him in.
He said he didn’t have a phone number, and told me, “you don’t have to be an a$$hole about it.” To which i replied, that i don’t appreciate being called an a—hole. Rather than apologize, he doubled down, saying that i was being uncooperative.
Such entitlement. 
This guy is a passenger in a civilian car and out of uniform. The only things that might identify him as a police officer were the radio on his belt, the badge around his neck, and his lousy entitled attitude.
I don’t even open the door for friends of friends. Sure, i see you visit my friend, regularly. But i can’t know if you’ve had a fight and aren’t here as a friend, this time.
So, i asked for his badge number. He said it as a full number, then the 3 individual digits, then, with a snide tone, asked me if i want him to write it down. To which i replied, “i may be an a—hole, but i’m not a dumb F—ing C…”
He had the audacity to tell me that i shouldn’t call myself an A hole. To which i responded, “no, i should leave that to you.”
After he left, unable to gain access to the building, rather than calm myself and head to the store, i went back inside and emailed the DOJ, since i live in a city who’s PD is under investigation, they have a dedicated email address, for our PD.
Edit: in case people might fear for my safety, in this situation, i am caucasian, therefore less likely to die from not kissing this bully’s butt, well enough",0.0,1.0359503,1,0
10,1coe3by,WIBTAH if I don't invite my brother to my wedding?,"I come from a large family and have a lot of siblings. One of my brothers and I do not have a real relationship. It hasn't been good for about seven years, and in that entire time we have spent maybe three hours total talking. We barely text, call or check in. When we do see each other at family functions, it is really awkward and we avoid one other. The reason why we have a bad relationship is a whole other post, so to keep that short, he wanted me to cover for him when he cheated on his wife (which I did not do). I do love my brother, but I do not like him. I do not want him involved in my life; he doesn't add anything positive to it.

Recently, my fiancé and I have been talking about planning our wedding within the next year or so. We have been working on saving to get our ideal venue, and we were talking about people we could cut out so that our necessary people could be guaranteed a seat (the venue caps at 100 people, and between the two of us, we have like 160 people). My brother happened to be someone I don't want to invite, and my fiancé is fully supportive of that. My brother is notorious for trying to embarrass people (especially us girls), and he did just that at two of my sisters' weddings.

I informed both of my parents about that decision, and they support me as well. My mother said while she would love for us all to get along, she understands we all have our own relationships and dynamics. My father said he fully understands my stance and will not work to sway me the other way. That made me feel much better knowing I had their support, and they said they won't say anything about it to anyone since that's my information to share if I choose to.

I then called one of my other brothers I am close with and asked for his opinion on the best way to approach this with the sibling I'm not inviting. I reached out to him specifically because he knows him the best and how he reacts. I don't want to send out invites and have him ask where his is, and I also don't want someone else to be the one to break the news to him. That would be a dick move in my eyes. I told him my plan is to have my fiancé there with me, or someone else, so that I have some comforting presence there. He told me that he thinks the whole thing is a bad idea.

He thinks I should still send him an invite and leave it to him to show up or not. If I don't want him there, then I should have that conversation with just him and not have anyone else there. He also mentioned he thinks I need to think it through some more because our other siblings who would go to the wedding would now be put in a really weird position with him; he would feel like everyone turned against him, or that he was left out, or that his other siblings shouldn't have gone because he isn't invited.

11,1coe011,AITA for wanting to get rid of a fish?,"For context: I (F16) have an aunt (F32?) who is a first time mom. She has an infant daughter who I believe is around 8 months old. They live upstairs with my uncle, who pays the rent at a reduced price since we're family. 

Yesterday, my aunt came down and handed me a plastic container with a betta fish in it. We don't speak English at home so what she said to me roughly translates to ""Here you go."" Then, she just left. I know this seems weird but she likes to bring stuff down like fruits she can't finish by herself. Already, the fish seemed in poor condition because there were feces in the water, the container was smaller than a cup, and it keep trying to escape. 

So, when my mom came home, I said that the fish was not my responsibility and that we should just hand it back to my aunt, who can deal with returning it. My mom then went to question my aunt about the fish. It was then that I found out my aunt had bought the fish to entertain her daughter but didn't want it after her daughter didn't look at it. To that, I said ""she (the baby) doesn't know what a fish is"" to my mom (which I thought was hilarious). Anyways, the issue is that my mom thinks the fish is going to survive if we just buy food. 

In response, I said it was ridiculous because who buys a fish without buying food in the first place. Second of all, the fish is living in a extremely small space and is constantly swimming upwards to escape. I also don't know how long it has been without food. My issue with the fish is the fact that it is not my responsibility to take care of it. However, I have a conscience and it's clear to me that the fish needs a bigger space as well. 

Now, it's become my problem to buy a tank and other necessities when I can't do that within the next few days when I have APs. I'm sure you don't have to be at home to take care of a fish but at this present moment, I cannot be researching places nearby, looking at tanks, and doing all that for something that wasn't my responsibility in the first place.

I have an amazing husband and two teens. My relationship with one of my children has been rather strained lately. As a result, I feel like a failure as a mother.

25,1coc8f2,AITA For accidentally not noticing when my wife was talking to me?,"Today I (30M) was laying in bed with my wife (30F) playing a video game together that we love, after a long stressful week. Our cat was also laying with us. We'd been having a pretty normal chill morning chatting and having fun with the game together. I made her a cup of coffee and had a little breakfast myself, and everything was pretty happy. At one point, since the cat was laying on the opposite side of me that she was, she leaned over onto me to pet him and was telling him how cute he was and cooing over him. This is pretty common, so I paid no mind and kept playing.

She apparently started saying something to me at that point. But since I was currently engrossed in a cutscene, and since she'd just been talking to the cat, I didn't realize she was now talking to me instead. She apparently even nudged me, but since she was already leaning on me moving around to pet the cat, I didn't notice the nudge and I think I just assumed it was part of her moving around to pet him. But then she got louder and got my attention, so I asked her to repeat what she'd said because I wasn't paying attention.

That set her off, and she got pissed at me for 'tuning her out'. I disagreed with that, because 'tuning her out' makes it sound like I was actively ignoring her on purpose and not caring, when actually I just hadn't been paying attention in the first place since I didn't realize she was addressing me. 'Tuning out' sounds to me like I knew she was talking to me, and simply chose to ignore her and not respond. Like I was mad or something and didn't want to listen to her. Which is so far from the case, as I value every thought and opinion she has, even IF I was mad. I just didn't realize at the time that she was talking to me and not the cat, so I just kept watching the cutscene, but I listened to her as soon as I realized she was talking to me.

She seems intent on believing that I did this on purpose, and when I ask her why she thinks I'd wilingly do something like that, her only reason she keeps giving me is that she even said my name, and ""well your ears didn't magically stop working"". I apologized repeatedly for not paying attention, and I understand that it was annoying for her to try to say something to me only for me to not notice. That's on me, I shouldn't have spaced out so hard, and should have been paying attention. But she seems to think this was a purposeful, conscious, malevolent thing I did out of malice or something, when it was just a dumb little accident I didn't mean to make. And that's all I've been telling her, that she has all the rights in the world to be annoyed or mad that I screwed up and was spacing out not paying attention, but I just want her to understand I didn't do it intentionally, and that I wasn't just 'tuning her out' and purposefully ignoring her. I have no reason to do that, I'm not mad or annoyed or anything, I was just distracted and didn't notice. So...AITA for failing to pay attention like that?
