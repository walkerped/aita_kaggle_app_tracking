0,1cpppva,AITA: my sister's wedding is today and there's a huge issue between my parents and I over the haircut they made me get,"I'm a 24 y/o trans man. I came out to immediate family when I was 19 and haven't asked anyone to call me by my correct name/pronouns because it will upset the peace. My parents were very hurt when I came out so I don't bring it up.

There's been a pattern of my parents controllingwhat happens to my body rather than me. Antidepressants at 13. Strict diet at 14 (low carbs, low calories, stomach injections, had to eat lunch alone in the school counselor's office). I stopped seeing a stylist my mom knew personally after asking for a 'boy haircut' and the stylist wouldn't go against my mom, who was embarrassed/angry. When I asked to wear a tie with my school uniform, my dad said only if I wore makeup. I still sucked my thumb at 12, and my parents had a dentist put in a device with a grid of metal wires against the roof of my mouth; every time I'd eat, pieces would get stuck between it and the top of my mouth. To my parents' credit they had this thing taken out pretty quickly. When I was 14-ish I stopped shaving my legs, so my dad would forcibly shave them with his electric razor and threaten to take my phone away if I refused.

My sister's wedding is today. Three days ago, I got a haircut. I'd known I wanted it short, so I texted my sister to ask if she was okay with that, which she was. My mom didn't want my hair too short though, and when I went to get the cut (from another stylist she knows), she said she hoped I would respect her wishes. The stylist did what my mom had told her, not me; my mom was the customer even though it was my hair. I left with a haircut that made me feel more like an object than a person.

For that day, and the next day, I stayed in my room at my parents' house and wouldn't show my hair. I know that sounds dramatic but I've experienced disrespect towards my body for years, and this haircut was feminine, which added dysphoria on top of it. My mom was worried, but my dad was angry. He accused me of wanting to 'make a statement' (about my gender) and make my sisters' big day about me.

Yesterday my mom and I had a talk about the pattern I explained and we both felt better after. I helped her set up at the venue and she said that I could get my hair touched up a little. But when my dad found out about that, he was really mad, called me to order me not to do it, and when I turned it into a three-way call with my mom who said she was okay with it, he said he didn't care and that I wasn't allowed to get it cut again.

When he got home he made the same accusations as before. I told him about the conversation with my mom and said that after the wedding he could be brought into that, but he demanded I explain everything right then. I didn't want to because I didn't trust him to listen or respect what I said without my mom there. I wouldn't get into it, and tried to tell him we should just make today about my sister, but he was disgusted with me and told me not to even bother coming to the wedding.

2,1cp7zi6,AITA for getting mad about a reserved cake my family ate?,"Edit: please stop suggesting laxatives

I (16) learned on May 8th that my friend was sick and not feeling well, so I dug out a cake mix and made it for her. Her family wasn't able to pick it up immediately because it was pretty spontaneous and they had stuff going on, so we decided to have one half of the cake and save the rest for my friend.

Pretty much right after I was done baking and frosting, my grandpa, who has a sweet tooth stronger than anyone else I know, even me, came and ate pretty much all of our half immediately. I wasn't bothered by this, since I got some too and it really was a good cake. Then I put foil on my friend's half, a note that explicitly said ""do not eat"" on it, and put it in the fridge.

May 10th - It hasn't been a full 48 hours and the other half is already eaten into and probably going to be gone soon. I went over to another friend's house for a few hours, and my family ate a noticeable part of it while I was unable to protect it. Worse, when I got home my grandma admitted she told my grandpa to cut it thin so I wouldn't notice. Then when I tried telling her that was rude and I needed another mix so I could replace it, she called my grandpa and he yelled at me for being mad over a cake.

What I'm angry about isn't so much the cake being eaten, but the fact that we all knew what the arrangement was, and that I was trying to make a kind gesture for my sick friend. Then they just carelessly went and ate more than their fair share, even though they already *had* a part of the cake they could have saved.

Firstly am a guy.

Some people have been asking for an update and I have talked to my sister and I actually feel bad because I painted her in a bad light because I was upset with where our conversation was going and  wanted a validating opinion. But after talking to her, she home for the summer now. I realized how little she has, like 50 dollars is what covers her hygiene products and school materials. And she really feels excluded from experiences and she just wanted to experience a fun night with her friends without worrying about money and I think that pretty valid. I think we both overreacted. Anyways me and my sister talked about finance I explained to her where my money goes and also made it clear that I think we should get a loan for what she has to pay next year. This is not to punish her but I chatted with someone on here and I realized how dangerous it was for me to have  nothing saved up. I used all my saving on her tuition so am just not in the best position to give right now. I can‚Äôt be living paycheck to paycheck when am a guardian of 2 other people you know. I am gonna ask a family member first if they can Loan it to us but if not we will just have to do it the official way. But I do believe that she is gonna receive a refund next semester but we still have to think of living accommodations and groceries. I am not gonna show her this post because a lot of you weren‚Äôt really nice with your delivery and went as far as to compare her to my mom which for us is the most hurtful thing you can say. She gonna work this summer. (She said she couldn‚Äôt  work in school because of her schedule and how spread out her classes are. ) I also called my friend that a graduate to talk to my sister about school resources because I really don't know much about that stuff. 


As for me  am doing okay, like I was gonna do a cna program because it free but I think am gonna save for an emt program instead, I don‚Äôt think the pay is much different from what am doing now but I assume that for a job like that there are benefits like insurance plus it more noble I guess. Kind of scared because I wasn‚Äôt the smartest In school but the only requirement was a diploma so wish me luck.

Edit: As to why I resent her: She was emotionally neglectful during my adolescence and emotionally abusive. Said a lot of things that made me feel worthless and to this day I struggle with the negative voices of her words. Her excuse was that she was under a lot of stress, which I don't deny.  Still She was an adult, I was a kid, I didn't deserve it.

I also had lots of years where I had unexplained health issues like headaches and insomnia and she tried to convince me they were in my head, that it was due to depression/anxiety instead of helping me find the ""real problem"". I eventually found the problem by myself but wasted many years thinking I had a mental illness. NOW today i actually do have depression because of this whole thing. She caused my depression

She has since then ""changed"" and tries to say positive words and always encourage me but it's just too late and I can't seem to let it go.

Still She was an adult, I was a kid, I didn't deserve it.

I also had lots of years where I had unexplained health issues like headaches and insomnia and she tried to convince me they were in my head, that it was due to depression/anxiety instead of helping me find the ""real problem"". I eventually found the problem by myself but wasted many years thinking I had a mental illness. NOW today i actually do have depression because of this whole thing. She caused my depression

She has since then ""changed"" and tries to say positive words and always encourage me but it's just too late and I can't seem to let it go. I needed her support when I was 14, not now when I'm an old. I've wasted half of my life, I really hate myself and I can't help but think it's mostly all her fault.",3.0,0.1302729,0,0

10,1cp625g,AITA for not listening to my aunt's complaints?,"This incident happened a few months ago. I (35F) was at my niece's wedding, staying with my brother (53M). The wedding was not for his daughter, but he lived in the same area and it was cheaper than getting a hotel, since flying to his city in Alabama was already expensive enough. So, the night before, we had the reception party, and all of us ended up getting back home having drunk quite a bit and sleeping late.

So late that our parents rolled in before any of us had really gotten up. I got up first because I'm usually an early riser. After talking to mom and dad, they had eaten breakfast, but I realized me, my brother, and his wife had not. Since I was getting hungry, I asked mom and dad if they would take me to a local shop to get a some breakfast sandwiches. As we were about to leave, our aunt and uncle rolled in. Note: Aunt and uncle were staying in the same hotel as mom and dad, so they ate breakfast together. Dad let them know we were going off to get some breakfast for me, and they'd be back.

Cue, I get mom and dad some starbucks to thank them for letting me borrow their car, and some chicken and biscuits for me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We get back, with all of them finally up, and I dish out the chicken and biscuits to them, and my aunt IMMEDIATELY starts pitching a fit. ""Why didn't you buy me one?""

Later, my brother tries to intervene and explain what happened, to which my aunt goes off, in front of me, ""Well it was selfish and inconsiderate!"" And my tactic when it comes to this sort of verbal abuse is to disengage. So I said, ""Okay, then,"" and immediately left and went back to my room.

After this, my brother pulled me aside and said me doing that proved my aunt right and I should have just stayed put. It was rude and assholish of me to just walk away.

I started renting from a family member with my RM (for privacy we‚Äôre in our mid 20s, qu**r, and dgaf about prounouns so I‚Äôll use she/her) about 2 years ago. Housing market sucks and with us both part-time, it was all we could afford.

RM is diagnosed with ADHD (not medicated), I am on the autism spectrum. Our families are not wealthy. I managed to get my associates on my own, she has a high school diploma, so we‚Äôre laughably unhireable for a job that pays more than minimum wage.
When we moved I attempted to establish what I thought were reasonable rules for the house since it was in the family and I didn‚Äôt want it to get trashed. No food kept in the bedrooms because we live in the country and rodents exist, and the house has a pantry and kitchen with plenty of space. I made with a cleaning list to take turns on to keep us things tidy and honestly it could‚Äôve been way worse. Just things like taking turns on dishes, trash, vacuuming once a week. Easy to keep track of and not time-consuming, does not have to be sparkling.
RM agreed to the chore list, but immediately the rules weren‚Äôt followed. Any sort of mess you can think of, it happened for months and I always had to ask her to participate and take her turn. Trash, moldy dishes for weeks, etc, didn‚Äôt do it without me asking. I got sick of it and started doing it all myself.
It really irks me because when we moved I was working 40 hrs a week (Assistant Manager at one job and night shift at the other job we shared), she only worked an average of 14-20 hrs a week, and then I came home to clean between shifts and on my days off.
Then after a few months RM brought to my attention that she thinks that my cleaning rules are ‚Äúextreme‚Äù and that she doesn‚Äôt think that food in her room will attract any pests. I didn‚Äôt have the capacity to argue with her at that point so I just let her do whatever and figured she would learn. She did not.

Idk if it‚Äôs ADHD or her past home life, she either willfully doesn‚Äôt notice things around her or genuinely doesn‚Äôt notice them, either way I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask.

I have never really fit in with others and don't click super well with others my age because I have very different values/morals/ethics from a lot of people my age in this day and age. Therefore I told my mum that she can invite the parents of a few families and their kids who are 18+ to the party as I don't want kids running around the restaurant and other teenagers just sitting there on their phones. My mother called me difficult and unreasonable for wanting to do this and has gone on so many rants being like ""What am I going to tell people about them not being able to bring their kids?"" I told her that she shouldn't care what other people think, it's my birthday party and everyone who is invited has me on social media, if they want an answer to that question then there is nothing stopping them from sending me a message on social media and that I would be more than happy to reply to them providing them with an explanation.

Last year was a really bad birthday for reasons that I won't get too into but something important to note is that I don't want to say it was traumatic because that would be self diagnosing and I don't want to be doing that and throwing words around but the memories of that birthday were blocked from my brain for a bit and it took me months to be able to remember things from that night and still I don't know if I will ever be able to remember everything. Therefore I was not planning on doing anything for my birthday this year until the news came out about my grandfather having cancer so now I feel obligated to have a party incase God forbid this is the last one he is alive for. I don't want this year to be a repeat of last year which is why I am being so strict on the guest list as I don't want to go ever go through the stress of wondering if my brain will ever allow me to remember the events of that night (there was lots of alcohol involved, screaming, putting on a happy front etc) at my 17th birthday.

I get where my mum is coming from in the sense that it will be a bit awkward letting them know that their kids won't be invited but as I already said to her, I am more than happy to have that conversation with them if they chose to confront me about it. So AITA?

UPDATE: I am allowing the families to bring their kids, hoping and praying that they're on their best behaviour. I need to forgive people for last years mistakes and give them a second chance.

It was wrong of my to wish to only give the adults a second chance. While I don't agree with the delivery of some of the comments I can see where you are coming from :)",1.0,1.0598882,1,1
17,1cp5aly,WIBTA For Asking My Roommate to Help With My Moving Costs Because He Asked Me To Move Out Early,"My roommate has asked me to move out of our 2 bedroom apartment at the end of May so his new wife can move in with him instead. For context, I moved into this apartment in September after subleasing from his former roommate. He has been in this apartment for at least 2 years. In December, we resigned a 15 month lease with both of our names on the lease so I am no longer subleasing.

When I originally agreed to move in, I was told that I wouldn't have to leave until I was ready to do so. I was also told that my current roommate would probably move before I did as he was planning on getting another job in a different state once he finished his master's degree. Back in March, he left to go to his home country for a month. While he was there, he got married, which he didn't tell me before he left. When he got back, we talked and he mentioned that his wife was probably going to come here at some point in the future but that was all we talked about. 

A little more than a week ago, at the beginning of May, he asked me to move out. I've thought about it and I've decided to go ahead with moving out, mainly because I'll be working elsewhere for 2 months over the summer so it'll save me some rent and allow me to make a clean start when I get back. I know that I have no requirement to do so, but his wife is coming one way or another and I don't want to end up in a living situation where no one else is happy with me. Plus, aside from this, he's been a very good roommate so I wish him no ill will.

  
My question is, WIBTA for asking him to help with the costs of moving since he's asking me to move out 5 months into a 15 month lease? I don't exactly have the money saved up to move since I wasn't expecting this. I would like to hire movers as I am sick and tired of constantly moving. I also plan on asking for my half of the security deposit back from him.",TL;DR,2024-05-11,"WIBTA For Asking My Roommate to Help With My Moving Costs Because He Asked Me To Move Out Early My roommate has asked me to move out of our 2 bedroom apartment at the end of May so his new wife can move in with him instead.

So I took care of all of our booking and she planned all of the things we‚Äôd do in the actual cities. I also used up all of my points I‚Äôd been saving for years on this trip and paid for both of our $800 concert tickets to this performer we love. 

We‚Äôre excited and I‚Äôm constantly asking her to start planning the trip but she‚Äôs a procrastinator.

20,1cpug23,AITA for telling of my friends that she's kinda supposed to look out for her mentally challenged younger brother?,"Hi, so I was on a outing with a couple of my university friends a few days ago, much of it went great, we talked about loads of things but at one point the topic about one of my friends younger brother came up. Well, more like brought up by her, it was honestly more like her venting about how her parents have increasingly been putting on the responsibilities of taking care of her mentally challenged younger brother particularly after she graduated and got a job. I do know she still lives with her parents, and pretty much most of us still do or are planning on moving out soon, anyways, most of us didn't really have anything to offer or say as we didn't really have any similar experience and we weren't trying to I guess intrude into her personal life and stuff so we kinda just tried to agree and relate with whatever we could, but she eventually was talking about her mother and her justifications and etc etc as well.

This is where I half jokingly said something along the lines of ""I mean, aren't you supposed to, since that's your sibling and you're the oldest, and your brother isn't some random stranger, so don't you kinda have the moral duty to take care of him and be expected to takeover when your parents eventually can't"" obviously, I didn't say this exactly like this but that was my point of view in summary. The thing is, this eventually grew into a debate and a argument and she got genuinely pissed and even told me ""how would you know, you're a only child you don't know anything"" etc etc. We kind of just agreed to disagree? More like just moved on in order to not escalate and she didn't talk to me for the rest of the day and was pissed. I kind of tried to make up with her at the end when we were all leaving but I could tell she was still visibly pissed and cold.

I didn't try to make it out like I conceded on my viewpoint or say I was wrong specifically mainly because I still have the same viewpoint, just a bit confused on why she took it so badly? I can't see what's wrong with my viewpoint or rather what I said was offensive. At first I thought I intruded into her personal issues, and I would totally get that, but she was kinda ""inviting"" us in to put it lightly. I do feel like maybe I defended my point of a view a little too much even though I don't have the same circumstances? Maybe I should've just agreed to everything she was saying? But I personally enjoy debate so maybe didn't think it through at the time?

Few days later and I'm still thinking about it, was I actually in the wrong? I'm thinking back and I still cannot see why my viewpoint and what I said was wrong. As the eldest child and with a mentally disabled younger sibling, it'd be her moral obligation to look out for her younger brother and eventually take care of him when her parents no longer can. In this regard, I guess I would align with her parents viewpoint? But I don't get why it pissed her off.

21,1cpu7o7,AITA for wanting to meet my sister's fianc√©'s family?,"Update:

I apologized to my sister, she accepted. We talked more about her feelings. Also I appreciate everyone's responses for helping me see that I saw indeed an asshole to my baby sister. After posting here and first responses I am suprised that I didn't see how wrong was my behavior. I am reflecting and I feel humble

Original Post:

My sister (25F) got engaged last week after being in a relationship for a year. Yesterday I (27F) asked her when she would organize a meeting with her fianc√©'s family. She said I would only meet them at the wedding. I asked why and she replied that she and her fianc√© had decided that and that was the end of the discussion. During our conversation, which took place over the phone, I disagreed with her and asked to talk to her in person when I will see her in three weeks. Today I called home to talk to my parents about how the weekend was going and my mom said that my sister was upset that I wanted to meet her fianc√©'s family behind her back. My mother, knowing my sister and having had some information from me about the telephone conversation with my sister yesterday, told her that she would not talk about what I said when I was not at home and I could not verify it and that we should talk about it together when I come home at the end of May. After calming down, she finally agreed that we should all talk. I must also mention that during the telephone conversation I described here, my sister accused me that I was going to meet her fianc√©'s family behind her back. These words came out of her mouth and as soon as I heard them, I assured her that I wouldn't do anything without her consent and if she convinced me of her point of view, I wouldn't ask her again to meet her fianc√©'s family. But still she repated her words to our parents today as mine. That's why I said that we shouldn't do it over the phone, but calmly, after some time passes, sit down face to face and talk about it.

A bit of background:

My family have not met anyone on her fianc√©'s side. My sister doesn't plan or want anyone in our family to meet them. The wedding is going to be awkward...

Even though I don't have a common language with her fianc√©, I can see how gentle he is towards her, which I really like, and he's definitely a better communicator than her.

Her fianc√© met my family a total of 6 times.

I am aware that this situation is minor for now, but I feel that there is something bigger behind it.

Relationships are full of nuances and I definitely left out a lot of them when writing this post. I also apologize in advance for any chaos or any language misunderstandings. English is my second language.

To make a long story short there, management for our building switched recently and the new company is refusing to send anyone out to fix our dishwasher and sink. That on top of the flooding, and other issues were just too much. Needless to say, we're looking to move, and since our lease is ending at the end of this month, we're moving quickly.  


My best friend said it would probably be better to ask friends and co-workers for boxes to use during our move, and so we've both been asking around and have managed to get our hands on a good amount to use.Well, here's the issue. My best friend told me that next Tuesday, they would be going out with a friend to get some more boxes from their place. I was a bit taken aback since next Tuesday is when we'll be celebrating my birthday.  


I have some issues, more like trauma, relating to my birthday. Every year since I was a kid, something horrible has happened on my birthday, or we've had to put celebrating aside in order to focus on more important things, whether it was my parents needing the money to finance a new car due to a wreck or my siblings having a special event planned that same day. My birthday has never really been about just me. That might sound selfish, but I guess I just have a lot of pent up feelings from years of being shelved.  


This year, I spent my actual birthday, which was in February, doing nothing but working because of some financial issues that sprung up regarding rent for our flat. I was depressed, and with everyone so busy during the following months, actually going out to celebrate with my best friend and other friends got pushed all the way until now, the end of May.  


My best friend assured me that they'd be going out at night, around 9, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal, but to me, it is a big deal. I asked them if this could happen any other day, but they said no, and that their friend was only available that day for us to go pick up the boxes.   


I feel crushed by this, but I also feel that it is unreasonable for me to feel this way. I put off my birthday by months to make sure it didn't conflict with any plans and yet it still managed to do so. I don't know, it just sort of feels unfair in a way.

Hello everyone- I'm (F16) and am currently the only child in the household as my older sibling is off in college. My parents are divorced, but don't have a bad relationship with each other. I always go to my dad's house on weekends, and on TOP of that- I have the AP Calculus BC exam on Monday morning so I need to study for it(but too emotional abt this issue to study atm...)

My mom is a really great mom who is considerate and very emotionally intelligent who has always supported me- however in January my step father has had an illness which makes her want to do all of the travel activities he wants to do and with all of their 'catch-up' travel from COVID, they are never home and it has really incited anger in me while they are gone, and when she is back home for periods of time- I feel as if I got used to her gone or is just upset because¬†**I can't stand being around her.**

The whole traveling thing hasn't been a new issue as she's been traveling like crazy for the past 2 years, but now I'm unhappy as my brother is out of the house, and I want support during exam season. For context, every month my mom leaves the country for 3days-1 week to take care of my grandparents in another area w/ doctors treatments and stuff. Then she goes on 3 week trips either to their vacation house(like 3500 MILES away) or business trips. Factoring the time I don't spend at her house with the divorce, her not being here, and when we are both in the home- the fact that I'm studying till 7PM... I do not talk to her at all.

Since I just get annoyed with her all the time, I don't find the urge to speak/hang out with her more- but I especially hate that she broke her promise that she'd stay during my ap/final season to support me. BECAUSE SHE DIDN""T- In the 5 days I HAD TWO HARD AP EXAMS AND A FINAL I ate ramen everyday till we ran out and then moved to frozen pizzas.

\*\*But I'm very picky, there were just no raw materials to make food in the house, she's prepared food before she's left on trips but I get even angrier because I get angry I feel guilty throwing so much food away, but I would NEVER eat 15 servings of the same pasta, that tastes horrible.

++ She added on her calendar she made me breakfast in preparation for one of my finals(they last two weeks and she made it back for some of them) but it was so bad that I didn't eat any and just went to school on an apple. I hate how she doesn't communicate, gets to feel like she is Mom #1 because she is 'doing stuff for her daughter' and it is food I would NEVER EAT - its like you don't know me??

So should I make the effort to text her to arrange mothers day plans since she is in the area? I won't be bringing a gift, nor a letter(because my dad's house has no paper to make a card & I have no supplies other than a pencil). On the family calendar I feel like she'd expect smth- because every other day of the month has 4-5 activites of her's scheduled but Sunday is blank.",Asshole,2024-05-11,"WIBTA if I don't invite/take initiative to invite my mom out for Mothers Day? # WIBTA If I don't invite my mom out for Mother's Day?

I visited them and brought a gift and all that. My sister and he already have a son (let‚Äôs call him Peter, 5m) and a newborn Jamie (2 months, m). 
They got into a fight because he lied to my sister that he is just getting groceries while he also met a friend which he brought to their home (this friend waited for him in the garage). They agreed that he could have some party time there after bringing the baby to sleep. However Jamie did not want sleep and my brother in law (Tom) insisted on already going to the garage to celebrate his birthday.

34,1cpsggj,AITA for asking my friends what flavor their wedding cake is?,"I (22f) am in the wedding party of my friends we will call Em(25f) and Roe(25m) who will be getting married in about 2 months. I have been really excited for the wedding since it'll be an opportunity for all the friends from college to get together for the first time in 2 years. Not to mention Em and Roe are my best friends, or at least I thought they were. 

We have a discord for all the wedding stuff and they have a channel about food. They've been really good about being open about the food they intend to have at the reception including vegan/vegitarian/gluten free options for everyone and answering questions so I didn't think there would be any contention if I asked a question. 

Anyway, about 4 days ago I posted a message into the discord asking ""Hey, what flavor is the cake gonna be? I wanna mentally prepare myself lol."" I think looking back my choice of extra words is what caused all this, but I meant it in the sense that I have a long documented dislike of chocolate flavored foods like cake or ice cream.  So I added it in the event the cake was chocolate. 

I recieved a private message back that the cake would be chocolate and that if I had a problem with it then I could ""shove it"" cause it was their wedding not mine. And i felt really taken aback by this response. 

Never did I mention that I would have been upset and I certainly wouldn't have put up a stink about it. Its exactly like Em had said, it's their wedding. I explained as much and tried to apologize for any offending I did but she got even more defensive and started basically blasting me for implying that she was offended and I was just left overall very confused. 

I gave it two days before I tried to apologize again and smooth it over figuring she may have just been having a bad day but I got shut down again telling me she didn't need my apology cause nothing was wrong and I needed time stop trying to make it seem like shit was wrong between us and to just drop it. 

I texted Roe to see if I could gauge what was going on since he and I have always had an open dialogue about things like this but he basically just told me he couldn't talk to me right now and I have to imagine its cause Em told him not to. 

Its been 2 days since then and I'm just really confused. This whole thing has made me want to drop out of the wedding party and honestly not go at all. I wish Roe would talk to me and Em would be honest. I can't help but think maybe I just don't get how stressful planning a wedding is and like maybe theyve gotten pushback from other people on other things and somehow its being taken out on me?

Since being here, we are distance-friendly with the neighbors. We don‚Äôt know anyone really but everyone is cordial, say hi when you see someone kind of thing. 

3 summers ago, the house on the corner sold. It‚Äôs a big, nice house with a slightly up hill back yard fenced with chain link that faces the road and our direction. When they moved in they built a chicken coop right next to the fence. It‚Äôs probably 5 feet high and a few feet across, with an extra bit covered in chicken wire. They painted it the color of the house and put a metal roof and it‚Äôs kind of cute. But in the winter, they covered the whole thing in plastic tarping. And it looked awful. With no green and it being at the top of a slope it was really visible behind the fence and looked very odd.

I didn‚Äôt mind the coop in the summer, but it was unsightly in the winter. So after 2 winters I looked into if that is permitable in our town. And it isn‚Äôt. Coops are not supposed to be visible from any street. 

Here‚Äôs the part where I may be TA. I filled out an online report for the ordinance breaking coop last winter. I hoped that they would just move the coop to a more discreet spot in the summer or plant a bush. And when nothing happened for months I thought maybe the city doesn‚Äôt care.

Instead, the neighbors recently covered their fence in big, black gardening tarp. And it looks like they might be cooking meth back there now. It‚Äôs way more visible and way uglier. And just weeks before they did that, the house directly across their backyard was sold and a new family moved in. 

My partner hates the black tarping and completely did not remember that I reported the coop, and when the neighbors first did the tarp he was thinking the new family turned them in!

In 30+y, we‚Äôve had pretty good neighbors, but 2y ago, a family with 3 boys and a dog moved in next door. The dad introduced himself saying he hates loud dogs (we have 2 chiweenies) and was oddly pushy about introducing the mom as a teacher because she homeschooled their kids, whom she said weren‚Äôt socialized.

Their kids play on our driveway and in our yard, leaving foam darts that the parents expect us to clean up because, according to them, their kids brought life to the aging cul-de-sac. Our dogs being small make them stalkable targets, despite our insistence that they can be unfriendly when approached by strangers.

One time their dog violently woke me up running and barking erratically at 1:30am for 1h+. While not one of my better decisions, I wrote a note and taped it to my window facing them stating that I would call the police if that happened again. Btw, the dad worked in law enforcement for \~ 2mo before suddenly quitting, unsure why. The dad came by later that day and called my note ‚Äúnot very adult‚Äù but did apologize to my dad (not me).

Since then, they let their dog bark around 3AM 1-2x/w and several times throughout the day (loud enough to hear across our well-insulated house). The kids also began playing on our backsteps, knocking over plants, banging against the glass door, and riling up my own dogs inside our house.

40,1cpryfk,AITA for throwing my college roommate a surprise party but not meeting her expectations?,"My other roommates and I (20F) threw my other roommate (we're all best friends), let's call her Ashely (21F), a surprise 21st birthday party. Ashley is in college for event planning, and she's always planning things for others, so we told her to relax and we'd make plan something. So she knew something was happening for her birthday but that's all she knew. She seemed excited and on board with not having to plan it.

Fast forward, I invited all of our mutual friends to our house, spent probably $100 (a lot for anyone but esp a college student) on decor and drinks, and set everything up. 

The party day comes and Ashley is having a great time at the party! I get a little too drunk at our house, and my boyfriend isn't feeling well, so I ask if it's okay if I don't join others at the bars for an after party. I'm also not 21. She seems okay with that and I send a group of people and her off to the bar. Keep in mind many people are not 21 in this group and only certain bars aren't wise to their fake IDs. 

The next morning, Ashley doesn't come out of her room for HOURS. So my other roommate and I bring her breakfast in bed. To our shock, she's been crying all morning. She tells us in dramatic fashion that she would have much preferred a bar crawl instead of a party, and that there were a few key people we didn't invite that we should've (I'll admit that we did miss a few people.) She also says that once people got to the bar nobody listened to her about where she wanted to go and that nobody cared. I feel bad about this, but she wanted to go somewhere that is known for taking fake IDs and that wasn't going to work for most people, as many were under 21.

She shows zero appreciation for what we did for her and this conversation goes on all day. She's laying on our living room couch crying for hours and she and I get into a big argument about how I can't believe how unappreciative she is and she's just feeling sorry for herself.

I feel bad she didn't have the 21st she was hoping for, but I feel like her expectations got the best of her.

Fast forward, I invited all of our mutual friends to our house, spent probably $100 (a lot for anyone but esp a college student) on decor and drinks, and set everything up. 

The party day comes and Ashley is having a great time at the party! I get a little too drunk at our house, and my boyfriend isn't feeling well, so I ask if it's okay if I don't join others at the bars for an after party. I'm also not 21. She seems okay with that and I send a group of people and her off to the bar. Keep in mind many people are not 21 in this group and only certain bars aren't wise to their fake IDs. 

The next morning, Ashley doesn't come out of her room for HOURS. So my other roommate and I bring her breakfast in bed. To our shock, she's been crying all morning. She tells us in dramatic fashion that she would have much preferred a bar crawl instead of a party, and that there were a few key people we didn't invite that we should've (I'll admit that we did miss a few people.) She also says that once people got to the bar nobody listened to her about where she wanted to go and that nobody cared. I feel bad about this, but she wanted to go somewhere that is known for taking fake IDs and that wasn't going to work for most people, as many were under 21.

She shows zero appreciation for what we did for her and this conversation goes on all day. She's laying on our living room couch crying for hours and she and I get into a big argument about how I can't believe how unappreciative she is and she's just feeling sorry for herself.

I feel bad she didn't have the 21st she was hoping for, but I feel like her expectations got the best of her. Am I the asshole for not knowing exactly what she would've wanted for her birthday gathering? ",4.0,1.01945161819458,1,0
41,1cprns9,AITA for asking my partner to change clothes after riding the bus,"I (23) and my partner (25) are having a disagreement about my expectation that after riding the bus, they change clothes before sitting on the couch.

Between the two of us, I am admittedly a little more high strung, although I don't believe that I have unrealistic standards. Our house is never spotless, I don't spend every day cleaning (usually just a couple hours on my weekend), and I feel that I don't ask much of them when it comes to chores. Their only chores (aside from tidying up and putting away their own belongings) consist of dishes (while I am cooking dinner), scooping litter every other night, and taking out the garbage. Otherwise, I am the one to clean the bathroom, fold laundry, vacuum the floors and furniture, dust, etc. I don't mind cleaning as much as they do, so our division of labor isn't too much of an issue. 

The problem today arose after we rode the bus home after a very nice morning together. I asked if they wouldn't mind taking off the clothes they wore on the bus before sitting on the sofa as it grossed me out a bit. The bus often smells like urine, and while I'm a huge proponent of public transportation, they generally aren't the cleanest of places. 

They are frustrated at the idea of having to change clothes when they get home (although I'm having trouble understanding why that's an issue as I do it every day). I'm not asking that they wash clothes after every use, and I'm not asking that they change clothes any time they wear them outside, it's mainly the bus that's the problem. 

From my perspective, it's in the same vein as not wearing shoes in the house, or outside clothes on the bed. I'm the one who cleans the furniture, and would just appreciate the peace of mind. I have some anxiety around cleanliness, but I truly don't think that I'm being unreasonable here.

It was so stressful for me. Her 11 year old kid ended up coming over. He was commenting how much space I had and said some uncomfortable things. She offered to take my kid to the park but what I really needed was not to be disrupted and have privacy.

I (19F) had a friend group consisting of me, 2 other girls (B and M), and a boy (H). I developed feelings for H. My friends knew.

M and I would hang out w him quite often. I told M I felt jealous of her bc it looked like H liked her more than me (I was just trying to communicate, not scare her). I brought this up a couple times. She assured me that she had ‚Äúthe ick‚Äù from him and would never want to pursue him.

Suddenly, M tells me that H confessed his feelings for her and she wanted to try being w him. I wished them the best but said I needed time to sort my feelings. Later, B gave me M‚Äôs perspective: We all found him attractive, so she was probably pushing down her feelings for my sake. When she told B, she was crying and felt rlly bad abt it.

Ik I can‚Äôt call dibs on a person and he chose her, but I felt a little hurt by how she pulled a full 180 on me. If she‚Äôd told me she liked him earlier, I wouldn‚Äôt have been so hurt.

They didn‚Äôt even work out and stopped talking. M avoided H and started talking shit about him.

M eventually admitted to me that whenever she was with H, she just wished he was her ex and labeled him as a rebound to get over her ex (situationship). This irked me; she wronged me by dating my crush when she didn‚Äôt even like him?

45,1cpqyjr,AITA for telling my mom not to make my sister visit me?,"

I (28F) have a 1/2 sister (15F). Because of the age gap we aren't as close as other people may be with their siblings. Don't get me wrong we love each other a lot but I moved out when she was 6 and I was 19, and I moved across the country, so we don't have Sunday dinners or anything.

The way we were raised was also completely different - I was raised by a single mom on welfare who worked two jobs to afford our two-bedroom walkup and struggled for years with untreated bipolar, of which I bore the brunt. When my sister came along my mom had a great job and a big house, was making almost 6 figures and had improved her mental health. To be clear I am NOT resentful of my sister, I'm happy she has opportunities that I didn't. Besides she has had struggles that I never had due to her POS father abandoning her and my mom when she was 12. And also my mother's new lifestyle benefits me in many ways as well.

Anyways I am currently 5 months pregnant and a few weeks ago my mom and sister came to visit. During this time my mom invested a few grand into my household - a combination of first grandbaby excitement and, as she put it, making up for the fact that she never had to pay for me to go to college. She filled up our fridge, bought a vaccuum cleaner and baby things, did our front yard, fixed some stuff... practical things that will help us in the long run. The entire time, my sister was complaining about the amount of money my mom was spending and how they were going to ""go broke"" etc.

I found my sister's commentary to be super disrespectful because my mom is very financially smart and would never spend money she didnt have. I basically told her to mind her business, our mom is an adult and can spend money on whatever she wants. I also reminded her of the thousands of dollars my mom spends monthly on my sister's archery lessons, tutoring, hair braiding, clothes shopping, cosplays, etc. and that my sister sure wasn't complaining while filling up the cart while we were shopping. I also heavily implied that she was acting like a spoiled brat. After that my sister didn't really talk to me for the rest of the trip.

Anyways now my mom and dad are planning to visit after my son is born and my mom was complaining that my sister doesn't want to come.

47,1cpqsc7,AITA for asking my husband to use less nicotine pouches ,"I moved to United States two years ago after living in Europe where smoking is a popular activity among people, I‚Äôve been smoking cigarettes on and off since I‚Äôm 19. 

After I married my husband and moved to US he and his family asked me to quit smoking as it‚Äôs not good for my health, it doesn‚Äôt look good and is not ‚Äúlady like‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt that easy to do that after years of being surrounded by smoker friends and smoking society but I decided I can at least cut the amount of cigarettes I smoke and only do that casually when we‚Äôre out drinking. 

My husband on the other hand was vaping a lot when we met and when I decided to limit my cigarette intake he decided to quit vaping with me. I saw that as an act of support and also as a sign that he also wanted to be healthier. But he eventually switched to nicotine pouches as an alternative to vaping and told me it helped him quit smoking. I thought that was a good alternative at first but now I realize he‚Äôs addicted to nicotine pouches, he usually used 1-2 packs a week but lately I‚Äôve noticed daily charges to our shared debit card from the smoke shop. It looks like he‚Äôs using a pack a day and to be completely honest I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to help him quit, I think he just exchanged one addiction with the other. 

Today I asked him if he could maybe get a pack every other day and then slowly take that number down along the way to help him quit smoking for good, but he only became more aggressive and told me I‚Äôm manipulative and controlling. I told him it‚Äôs unfair to me because I limited my cigarette smoking to only when we‚Äôre out drinking, and I feel like if I smoke a couple of cigarettes over a weekend he should also limit his nicotine pouches. I explained to him that it‚Äôs not fair to me to hear from him, his friends and his family how cigarettes are ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and honestly I‚Äôm really trying to cut off the ‚Äúweekend social smoking‚Äù as well, but it‚Äôs not very easy for me.

It‚Äôs like if you quit smoking joints and someone would eat edibles in front of you and tell you ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a joint and it doesn‚Äôt stink like a joint hence I‚Äôm allowed to do that‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt that easy to do that after years of being surrounded by smoker friends and smoking society but I decided I can at least cut the amount of cigarettes I smoke and only do that casually when we‚Äôre out drinking. 

My husband on the other hand was vaping a lot when we met and when I decided to limit my cigarette intake he decided to quit vaping with me. I saw that as an act of support and also as a sign that he also wanted to be healthier. But he eventually switched to nicotine pouches as an alternative to vaping and told me it helped him quit smoking. I thought that was a good alternative at first but now I realize he‚Äôs addicted to nicotine pouches, he usually used 1-2 packs a week but lately I‚Äôve noticed daily charges to our shared debit card from the smoke shop. It looks like he‚Äôs using a pack a day and to be completely honest I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to help him quit, I think he just exchanged one addiction with the other. 

Today I asked him if he could maybe get a pack every other day and then slowly take that number down along the way to help him quit smoking for good, but he only became more aggressive and told me I‚Äôm manipulative and controlling. I told him it‚Äôs unfair to me because I limited my cigarette smoking to only when we‚Äôre out drinking, and I feel like if I smoke a couple of cigarettes over a weekend he should also limit his nicotine pouches. I explained to him that it‚Äôs not fair to me to hear from him, his friends and his family how cigarettes are ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and honestly I‚Äôm really trying to cut off the ‚Äúweekend social smoking‚Äù as well, but it‚Äôs not very easy for me. I feel like him and everyone around him shittalks my smoking but when it comes to him sucking on nicotine pouches that goes completely unnoticed. It‚Äôs like if you quit smoking joints and someone would eat edibles in front of you and tell you ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a joint and it doesn‚Äôt stink like a joint hence I‚Äôm allowed to do that‚Äù

Eventually he said ‚Äúacknowledged‚Äù and brushed me off. I don‚Äôt think he actually ‚Äúacknowledged‚Äù what I was saying as he was very aggressive about it and made it look like I insulted him by asking him to use less. Am I the asshole for asking him to use less nicotine pouches? ",0.0,0.9703521132469177,1,0

Autism has been suspected for me. However, I was never diagnosed as autistic. When I was 13, I was diagnosed as having anxiety, not having autism.
 
My sister is 22 years old and recently graduated university. She recently threw a party for her graduation and decided to invite friends over to her house, including Adam, who I had never met before. 

They had all been in the basement and so had I. They were playing KPOP music videos on the tv and I was watching and listening. My sister is also a KPOP fan. Then, I started talking to them about my favorite non-KPOP celebrities (some of which, depending on the person, are also enjoyed by them). I also send them lots of stuff on Insta about them. 
Admittedly, my interest in the non-KPOP celebrities began when I was young as I was different from others at school and felt represented by them, which made me feel happy. I do have a tendency to talk about things too much and monologue about things for too long sometimes, which is another reason why people speculated I was autistic. However, I am trying to work on it. 

My sister would sometimes glare at me as I talked and then squeeze my leg. I guess this was a subtle signal for me to stop talking about them. However, she would also squeeze my leg sometimes to show affection, which made me think otherwise and so I continued talking about them. My sister then made a very angry glare at me, with no squeezing. I then started crying cause I felt anxious and then left the room. 
I went to go focus on studying cause I had to read some stuff for my work related training that was happening in a week. 
My sister then scolded me, asking me how much stuff I send her friends about the non-KPOP related celebrities and asking me why I talked so much about them. I said I talked about them so much because I liked them. 
She then said ‚ÄúYou like science. Why don‚Äôt you talk about science at the party? I guess you don‚Äôt like science that much.‚Äù 

I then called her a hypocrite and she walked away. When it came to the non-KPOP celebrities during the pandemic, she would tell me that when in-person school returned I should only talk about the members of band A and not bands B and C because they are not popular and therefore not as familiar of a topic with my peers.

I hope you enjoy the story. Before I start, I just want to warn that I'm not fluent in english, so sorry if you see any grammar erro in this post.

So, I(17f) am going to celebrate my birthday at the beginning of next month (June). My mon and I are planning my birthday dinner. The problem appears when we begin to discuss which guests we should invite, I recomend to invite a friend of mine, my mom's boyfriend and her family side. At first, she seemed to accept the ideia, but today she said that she didn't feel too confortble to invite her family to pretend that everything is fine.
A little context, my mom feels that her family doesn't care so much about her. According to her, my grandpa doesn't care so much about her since she accepted my father back (today, they are separated) and the rest of her family gradually lost interest in her, they don't visit our house since we change homes, and almost nobody don't contact her, just her stepmom and my grandma (she's not relevant in this story because she lives in another country, is just for you to have an idea).
In my point of view, I have good memories with her family. I see that they don't contact us, but still I had the oportunity to pass some time with them and I feel that they were good to me.
But, still I really want to invite them because of this but I don't want to hurt my mom's feelings and transform this into a big problem to me, her and her family.
So, I Will be the a*hole if I invite her family side just because it's my birthday and I want them there?

56,1cpp9h2,AITA for being upset that my parents told my sister I'm buying a house?,"So I (28F) recently got the opportunity to purchase a house that has been in the family for quite awhile (80+ years). I have been staying at home with my parents rent free for nearly my entire life. I occasionally contribute with groceries, dinners, household chores, and yardwork, but they have never charged me rent despite me offering. I work in public education and don't make great money so it has been very helpful to save up. I started the purchase process and have locked in an interest rate and have nearly everything ready.

The closing date is set for a month from now. I have asked my parents not to say anything to my sister (26F) until I close and start to move because we don't get along well and I don't want to deal with the fallout I believe will come. She has also been living at home, but instead of saving money she spends quite a bit. 2 new cars within 3 years, large tattoos, vacations, etc. She has a large storage unit filled with stuff she claims she has bought for when she buys a house. I don't care how she spends her money, but she makes significantly more than me and has wiped most of her savings out by living like this.

Instead of them waiting like I asked, they went ahead and told her. They claimed it was ""too difficult"" to keep it a secret and that she ""knew something was going on"". Now she is basically throwing a tantrum saying that it isn't fair I get to buy a house and she doesn't, claiming that they never helped her with anything, etc. Every time she sees me she is pissed off and starts a fight. I told them that this was what was going to happen and they claim that they couldn't have known/didn't think she was going to act like this. I feel like I am rightfully upset about this, but they say I am acting like a child and need to just get over it. AITA?

EDIT: I really truly did not think this was going to get as much attention as it has....here are a few answers to questions I keep seeing.

1. I am not getting any kind of monetary discount on the house. I got first offerings because the relative who is selling it asked me first and I said yes. The only thing I am getting is the washer/dryer and snowblower that they're leaving behind.
2. My sister has been shown the house by my parents (now that she knows, I found this out about an hour ago) and she has commented on how ugly she thinks it is and that she hates it. She claims she wouldn't have wanted it anyway, but is still very angry about it all.
3. The house overall is about 200k in a MCOL area. It is 4 bedrooms 1.5 bathrooms. I am not planning on getting a roommate, I would prefer to be alone.
4. This house isn't sentimental to her or I in any way. We didn't grow up going to this house for holidays or gatherings. We have both been in it maybe 3 times prior to me purchasing it.
5. I don't believe my parents are being intentionally disrespectful/rude/spiteful, I believe them when they say it was hard to keep it a secret. I just wish they would have listened when I asked them to wait.
6. My sister and I have had a rocky relationship for years. We don't speak often despite living in the same house and our work schedules are pretty opposite so we typically can naturally avoid one another.
7. When I said ""occasionally"" contribute, I meant when I have time. I work 50-60 hour weeks and by the time I go to do something, it often is already done. I do my best to help out despite those of you who think I don't do anything. My mom is also the kind of person who constantly refuses help and gets upset if you insist on helping, so I don't push it to save everyone's sanity.

58,1cpp5q6,WIBTA -Housemate trouble,"Hey everybody, 
I need some help with advice/perspective...

The story as it was told to me was: a mutual friend (51F) of mine (37F) and my husband's (37M) was, essentially, given an eviction notice and told to leave ""as quickly as she could"".
We offered our spare bedroom. She was already looking for a house and we didn't want her to feel rushed and have to settle on something she doesn't REALLY want...

It was a rushed moved; they got it all done on a day I was at work.  I came home and there was some stuff from the spare room, some of her stuff ALL over my house... not to mention we've had to crate our dog (Siberian Husky) because SHE has sheep and, apparently, THEY get the bank yard...

... the first few days or so, fine... no one had the chance to fix or change anything.  I would have, myself, but the things from the spare room are my husband's... I don't feel comfortable, or like it's my responsibility, to move either or *their* things for them...

But we're going on two weeks and nothing has changed.  I'm starting to resent... everything.   The treatment of my dog: being in the crate because he can't be let outside... inside is like a kids' room in the sense that there are paths through the clutter so we can get to doors and such, so he doesn't have room to play... he's a husky! So he talks a little (he's actually very quiet for a husky), but it keeps her awake, so she'll wake my husband up to do something about it... she's scared of bigger dogs (he's, maybe 50lbs) because of some past trauma and won't take pupper outside...
I feel like the house is only mine in paper and that I'm trapped and have no control... and I hate that I feel I have to tiptoe around and accommodate her because she's autistic...

... but I also hate that I feel that way...

...I just need some help... possibly advice...

I (21F) have been part of a theatre program in college as my undergrad. This program lasts four years and you are typically with the same group of people for 3/4 years.

66,1cpo8rn,AITA for not wanting to take furniture with me to move across states?,"Hello so 20m here and I‚Äôm planning to move across country in the fall due to school. About a 14 hour drive away across the country. My dad insists on me getting like a trailer to hook up to the back of my car, or a shipping crate and take the furniture in my room with me. The thing is if I got something hooked up to my car I don‚Äôt think id be able to drive it haha. And shipping crates or uhauls or whatever it‚Äôs to expensive and it‚Äôs to far to drive myself or have a friend drive alone.

 I just want load my car up with my clothes, gaming consoles, computer and monitors, my guitars, vinyl collection, and additional miscellaneous stuff, like memory photos, graduation downs yk the stuff that just sits in the closet. All that stuff and driving to my new apartment. I KNOW it would fit. Besides the computer monitors everything else is enough to go in boxes. I already packed half of it and it‚Äôs gonna be like 4-6 boxes max. I drive a 2012 charger. Very roomy back seat and trunk space.

I told my dad I‚Äôm perfectly content with sleeping on some blankets and pillows on the floor until I get there and work. I‚Äôm very easy to please and I don‚Äôt need much.  Maybe get an air mattress right away. Who knows because I‚Äôm planning to put in HOURS the next couple months and after I pay all the bills and stuff I could have some money saved along with what I already have (about 2.3 grand) and my new job is full time 27/hr with a possibility of OT. And I don‚Äôt have any bills at the moment since I‚Äôm living with my dad I just pay car gas, food and the occasional small purchase here and there. So I should have some decent funds.

Also; keep in mind my room and style is very nice but VERY cheap. I get all my furniture from Amazon and build it myself. Looks very nice but the stuff he wants me to take (PC desk, TV Stand, fouton/couch, Dresser, Bed-frame,box spring and mattress) could not cost more than $1000. Most of that just being my mattress haha. And the thing is my friend in my current state just moved and he needs a couch. Another friend moved to and needs the tv stand and pc desk. And my brothers mattress is on its last leg so he could use my whole set. It just seems reasonable to let them have it all which they said they‚Äôd gladly take.

I told him to drive the U-Haul or my car with a trailer connected to it and pay the fees he said no. I said buy me new furniture he said no we have perfectly good furniture in my room. So why is he complaining? He said he doesn‚Äôt want me living in an unfurnished home like a hooligan/bum lmao. His opinion is big because he‚Äôs co-signing my apartment and I have literally nobody else. I don‚Äôt have an income technically when I‚Äôm there. And I‚Äôve applied to jobs they said they‚Äôll speak to me when I‚Äôm actually IN state so no go getting a letter in advance.

We did all of our wedding planning ourselves, paid for our wedding party‚Äôs dresses and ties, and just want them there with us on our big day, and don‚Äôt expect any of the typcial roles‚Äô tasks.

All of our wedding party (but one) is one big friend group and we‚Äôre all really close. Now the exception to the friend group is my fiance‚Äôs brother, ‚ÄúIvan‚Äù (20M). For background/context, Brian and Ivan aren‚Äôt close. Ivan had a lot of issues growing up, and I don‚Äôt mean the typical childhood acting out. With mandated couseling as a child (to avoid legal consequences), he did eventually grow out of that behaviour‚Äîbut not necessarily for the better. He is very rude, has no respect for others, but is extremely manipulative and knows how to act in public, especially around adults. The people who DO know Ivan‚Äôs real attitude are shocked to find out that Ivan and Brian are brothers because Brian is an amazing human, while Ivan‚Ä¶is not. But he is seen as the golden child and all the adults love him (by Ivan‚Äôs divine scheme) and cling to his every word. To state one example, my fiance and I were recently kicked out of our *very Christian* church for ‚Äúfornication‚Äù, because of Ivan having told the pastor that my fiance and I had been living together for years prior to marriage. While it is true that my fiance currently lives with me, it has been under a year and is because Ivan told Brian he would throw all of his stuff out if he didn‚Äôt take it and leave (they shared a room and Ivan wanted it to himself). Since Brian and I were getting married anyways, he came to live with me, which also made wedding planner easier, but I digress. The pastor told my fiance and I that we were shameful, and when we tried to explain, he told us we were disrespectful for talking back and that Ivan has been ‚Äúso hurt‚Äù because he misses his brother, and essentially told us to leave the church so we wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúinfluence others with our bad behaviour‚Äù.

Anyways, because of the importance of family in our culture and knowing that Ivan won‚Äôt cause a scene at our wedding, we had asked Ivan to be a groomsman. Some people from our wedding party know him and were friends with him at some point, but can‚Äôt stand being around him. Needless to say, no one likes having him around, including Brian.

68,1cpnous,WIBTA for leaving my mom and staying at a dorm instead?,"Throwaway for obvious reason.

There's a long background story that's taken years but the gist of it is:

When I \[33F\] was 18, my mom took a loan from the bank, using our house as a guarantee. She failed to pay them. I told her that she had only 2 options now, either borrow money from another to pay this or sell the house even if it's below market price, as long as it's still enough to pay the loan, then move to a smaller place. She refused to. Long story short, the bank repossessed the house.

My mom then was (still is) trying to sue the bank back to basically still keeping the ownership of the house or get some money back from them (not exactly sure how). It's going on for years and there's a lot of process. And I guess she's able to hold out until now. I personally have always felt this house is already a lost case and rather fixing the damage and move on. 

The bank finally sold the house to someone this February. And yesterday, this someone sent few guys (think debt collector people) and demanded us to move out. They offered to help us find someplace else to live and pay for it for a year and also 2000dollars. But we have to move out soon. 

My brother and I are considering it. But my mom and my aunt doesn't want to. They think it's not enough and they want to hold on to the house, which, their right their decision I suppose. Because she refused to, the guys also refused to go. They have been staying here and sleeping on the porch for two nights now, and each time, more guys appeared. Granted, they're just staying outside. But I have been on anxiety mode now ever since and really close to breaking down.

I told my mom, she needed to give them a date when we move out and they'll be gone. My mom and aunt think they already fight for this long, they cannot give up now. Which I get it.

But I'm terrified. I can't sleep. I already have an anxiety and this just makes it worse. I told her, if that's her decision, I'm going to make a decision for myself too. I'm going to move to a dorm near the house. My mom asked me not to, she needs me here to support her. Which I also get. She's also terrified. But I can't do this. I can't live like this. There are literally 12 guys outside sleeping at the porch right now. I feel like a prisoner. 

So I decide I'm going to move tomorrow morning. I'm grateful I'm in a position where I can immediately move. I already found a room. My mom and my aunt think I'm a bad kid for not supporting my mom's decision. But I just can't. I may look fine and angry on the outside, that's the facade my mom sees, but inside, I'm on the edge of spiraling right now.

69,1cpnnqd,AITA for not forgiving my mother after she broke my trust?,"I(22F) have been in a ""Silent treatment"" off with my mother (60F) for the past three to four days. Something that has been especially hard since Mother's Day is tomorrow. Over the summer, I started to finally get into therapy to help improve my self-confidence and my anxiety. My therapy at the time gave me a journal to express how I truly felt. I mainly wrote about how I loved my family, but my family doesn't know how to love me. Even though I told my mother the journal existed, I kept it hidden at the bottom of my purse. My mom was driving me to my internship where she bursted out crying. Saying that she had read my journal and asking if I didn't love her or my family. I expressed how I felt betrayed. That I did in fact love my family, but feel like they don't take me and my interest seriously (I'm a big sensitive nerd, while my family is all sporty/sport enthusiasts). I also expressed how bad my mental health really was, and they weren't doing anything with how I said to support me. My mom admitted she was wrong for reading the journal, but disagreed about her support.

Flash forward to two weeks ago, I'm graduating and my best friend gives me a gag-gift. I'm obsessed with Spider-Man 2099 from the Spider-Verse movies (If you know, you know) and she got me a perfume that looks like the made up drug ""Rapture"".
It looks just like an actual medicine bottle, and I love it so much. It's kept in a sealed black box on my desk. The week before my graduation, I'm driving with my mom back, and I discovered a picture of my perfume on her phone. I immediately asked how she got that, and she explains she saw an unfamiliar box on my desk with an unfamiliar address on the label (My friend's address) and opened it. She discovered the vile perfume and got scared that I would hurt myself. I asked if she looked up what it was and she said she did and only Spider-Man came up. I expressed how she had no right to go through my things. That I was angry and upset, and she should have come to me about the item; instead of taking it. My mom admitted to being wrong, but once again doing it out of concern for me.

Now we're here at this week, She asked if she could borrow a long necklace from me, and I said l'd see what I had. Only for that night, my mom goes into my room and takes my most expensive necklace. I just about lost it, wanted to burst into her room, but controlled myself. I know I was acting a bit silly, but after the last two instances. I feel like my mom doesn't respect my privacy and this was triggering. I texted her in the morning that I wanted the necklace back and I didn't trust her since she likes to rummage through my things. That is what has caused the silence since then. I get I should express myself more, but it's hard when my feelings aren't taken seriously.

71,1cpmx0c,AITA for telling my friend I no longer want to go with her to an event and will refund her?,"AITA for telling my best friend I no longer want to go with her to a large music festival a month away? To put things into perspective, I had put the tickets under name and we had a payment plan where she sent me money (mostly late) over the course of a few months.

  
She has been extremely toxic to me for a while now. The festival is a month away and I have ultimately came to the decision that I no longer want to go with her. It is a 15 hour drive, sharing the same tent, and festivals are hard on not only your body, but your mind. You also are in a party environment, where it's hot, and there is no real personal space.

We have been best friends for many years. But she has started to dismiss me entirely. She is going through a lot of stuff right now, such as a breakup, and is in a dark place. I understand that. I have tried to reach out to her and was ignored all of those times, and these are all different days that it has happened. She was supposed to go with me to an event and stay in a hotel room with me and 3 other friends. She just bailed on me and wouldn't respond to my messages. My friends and I all had to pay extra for her not being there.

She also has ruined 2 of my other times at this music festival. She gets so in her head and literally made us both have a bad time. I was sobbing at a music festival of all places because of how cruel she was being to me.  I don't think it's healthy for her to go on this trip entirely, although that's my opinion. I just don't think it's a good idea for us to go together anymore. I don't think this will be resolved in a month, and I don't want to have a conversation to sweep it under the rug for the sole purpose of the trip together.

I feel like an asshole, I really do. I have a good friend who can pay the very large amount of money for me to send back to her immediately. She is demanding to have a face to face conversation now (and I wish she had the same energy for before it was about tickets), and I can have that conversation. But I will not change my mind. It just doesn't feel right, and there's no way to split up the tickets, and I still want to go. I told her she still can go, just without me, and she would still have plenty of money and time to figure out a better situation.

I don't want to end our friendship necessarily, but I need space and that environment is not going to be it. I will say that I told her all of this in a text message, as I knew she would be angry and yell and I wouldn't get to say my true feelings.

I feel so guilty, but I just want to send her the money and get the boundary and space that I need.

She also has ruined 2 of my other times at this music festival. She gets so in her head and literally made us both have a bad time. I was sobbing at a music festival of all places because of how cruel she was being to me.  I don't think it's healthy for her to go on this trip entirely, although that's my opinion. I just don't think it's a good idea for us to go together anymore. I don't think this will be resolved in a month, and I don't want to have a conversation to sweep it under the rug for the sole purpose of the trip together.

I feel like an asshole, I really do. I have a good friend who can pay the very large amount of money for me to send back to her immediately. She is demanding to have a face to face conversation now (and I wish she had the same energy for before it was about tickets), and I can have that conversation. But I will not change my mind. It just doesn't feel right, and there's no way to split up the tickets, and I still want to go. I told her she still can go, just without me, and she would still have plenty of money and time to figure out a better situation.

I don't want to end our friendship necessarily, but I need space and that environment is not going to be it. I will say that I told her all of this in a text message, as I knew she would be angry and yell and I wouldn't get to say my true feelings.

I feel so guilty, but I just want to send her the money and get the boundary and space that I need.

  
TLDR: Am I the asshole for standing up for myself and no longer wanting to go together with my best friend to a music festival, and instead offering to send her the money back to get my space from the toxicity?",0.0,0.019614562392234802,0,1
72,1cpmujr,AITA for posting pictures of my girlfriend to Instagram?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So my girlfriend and I recently went on a couple of kayaking trips where I took photos and where she asked me to take photos of her as well. She sent me 2 photos from the first trip she wanted me to post. I had selected another 8 or so pictures that I took from both trips that I wanted to post, some of which included her in them. When I showed her the post, she got upset that I posted pictures of her that she didn't approve of, asking me to delete the post. I got upset about this because it just didn't make sense why she'd get so upset. I'm posting pictures that I took, with my phone, onto my private Instagram account that I want to post. I take pictures to share them with my friends and memories (obviously). Why shouldn't I be able to post what I want to post on my own account?

**Edit to add that I did delete the post after she had asked me to. I didn't wait to take it down, I took it down as soon as she had told me to take it down**

She's explained to me before that she gets self-conscious about herself and doesn't want me posting pictures of her that she hasn't approved of and without her consent, as she put it. I've posted pictures of us before that she didn't look at beforehand and was okay with my choices. She's typically okay with the pictures I choose to post, and she sees the pictures I take, and I make it a point to point out the ones I like.

As I said, I did get upset about this. I took time to myself and apologized for how I handled the situation and how I was ready to talk and explain myself (when I get upset, I separate myself to prevent escalation and give a time frame of when I'll be ready to talk). After I explained my side (stated up above), she seemed to be even more upset by it, claiming that if I wanted to post pictures, then to crop her out. This was followed by my asking, ""What's the point of me taking pictures or you asking me if I'm going to make a post if you're going to dictate what I can and cannot post?""

It feels like I'm just the bad guy here, despite me believing I didn't do anything wrong.

73,1cpmq9c,AITA for wanting privacy to breastfeed my newborn?,"Hello! I gave birth about two weeks ago and my husband and I decided 2 months ago to not let anyone see our newborn baby for a good month. I told my mother and told his parents too

I do not particularly get along with my husband parents because of how much his step mom constantly criticizes me (that I am too introverted, why I don't go to every family event, and she even gets mad that I do not go visit them every week but I like my space and don't even visit my mother every week) 

We made the mistake of letting our families come the day of the delivery to see our newborn before they will not see the baby for another few weeks.
(We wanted a month to ourselves with the baby).

His step mom came in and made an interesting comment saying ""Thank you for giving me my grandbaby"". Which I thought was odd because no ""wow you did amazing"" or other compliments? I brushed it off because I was very exhausted and went through 11 hours of labor.

His step mom left and his biological mom (yes they are a lesbian couple) 
decided to stay so my husband can go grab his grandma so she can meet the baby too. While I was in the room alone with my mother in law, the nurse came in telling me I need to breastfeed the baby to start getting my milk supply to come in.
 My mother in law then proceeded to ask me if I wanted her to stay or leave which was a relief because I didn't have to bring it up! So I let her know it'll be kind of her to leave so I can have privacy to breastfeed my newborn baby because I am not comfortable to do it in front of her.

I didn't think that was a problem and apparently I was wrong.

I heard a few days later his mom left crying because I didn't want to breastfeed the baby in front of her. She told my husband she could've turned around while I breastfeeding and my husband defended me saying it's my choice whether or not I want someone to watch or to leave.

His parents didn't get it and took it to another level.
His step mom proceeded to call me rude and unpleasant behind my back to my husband,  simply because I do not feel comfortable breastfeeding in front of them. 
His step mom never liked me because I am not the woman she wanted my husband to marry. She has talked behind my back countless of times and instead of coming up to me and confronting me like an adult. Everytime she has talked behind my back the day that I do see her, she's all smiley and says she loves me. 
Then I will find out days later how she hates that I do not visit them every week and again with how I am not that talk active. 

She even complained to my husband when I was 39 weeks pregnant why I didn't go visit his family when I was clearly over being pregnant and didn't want to go out. 

His parents have told my husband that I am wrong for what I did the day of the delivery.

74,1cpmg65,AITA for asking my DH to ‚Äòendure‚Äô a 2 week free holiday?,"DH (M42) and I (F44) and our 2 boys (12 and 8) live in a different country from my family. My dad is lucky enough to be enjoying a comfortable retirement, and as part of that he chooses to fund a holiday for our whole family in the summer (him and mum, my brother, SIL and 3 kids, and our family) every 2 years. This has varied from a week in a self-catering villa, to a weeks all-inclusive and in more recent years has evolved to a 2-week holiday. These holidays allow my parents to spend time with their grandkids and equally as important, allow the grandkids time with each other, which is otherwise rare.
DH is a very different personality to my family. They are loud, like a drink and we discuss / debate anything and everything, from history to politics and current affairs. Loudly and sometimes aggressively (or it may seem that way to outsiders). I‚Äôll openly admit that I probably become much louder when I am around them (and probably drink more). DH is much more introverted, almost tee-total and struggles with the dynamics of my family when we‚Äôre all together. Although he swears he doesn‚Äôt dislike them.
Last years family holiday was 2 weeks all-inclusive in Greece. ‚ÄòWe‚Äô decided that we‚Äôd only go for one week, partly because of the family dynamics and partly because the type of holiday is not DHs ideal. The kids had a wonderful time, but despite only being there for a week, DH completely withdrew into himself. He seemed to act normal around my family but completely shut down around me. Barely spoke to me, hardly touched me, was very tense and sometimes even mean. He was acting like it was me and my family vs him. It was so unlike him that I was actually contemplating couples therapy. But when we got home everything was fine and back to normal. I spoke with him about it and he hadn‚Äôt even realized he was being like that. He apologized and we‚Äôve put it behind us. Kind of. My family are now planning next years holiday and DH is saying we shouldn‚Äôt even stay a week. He feels it will threaten our marriage too much, and says if he has to to choose between our marriage and a holiday, he will choose us. My view is that 1) this is not ‚Äòjust‚Äô a holiday - it is rare and limited time with my family, 2) if we are aware of a potential issue, can we not avoid it next time? And 3) it‚Äôs HIS problem‚Ä¶.why can‚Äôt he just suck it up and deal with it?
I‚Äôd love to go for the 2 weeks but I‚Äôd be happy with a week. 5 days is so short, by the time we settle into a routine it‚Äôs time to leave already. I also don‚Äôt feel like I can explain to my parents why we‚Äôd be coming for less than a week without making it look like DHs fault (which it is, but I don‚Äôt want to strain the relationship further).
At the moment I‚Äôm feeling like he‚Äôs ungrateful for my dads generosity, selfish for denying me and the kids this family time, and possibly even gaslighting me with the guilt trip over our marriage.

81,1cpl9k4,AITA for not reimbursing my son's mom for his sleepaway camp?,"Our 8yo son is going to his first sleepaway camp next month. Since my ex and I make the same income, we do not give or get child support but rather pay for different expenses. For example, I pay for his sitter and she pays for his extracurricular activities like camp.

Sleepaway camp was so expensive that they don't even list the cost online. Basically his camp and sports cost more than his sitter so I agreed reimburse her whatever the difference is between that and childcare. So far it's $150 and I said I'd give it to her today when we see each other at our son's swim lesson.

I was on my way home after a short business trip. Obviously my son was at his mom's. I got a call from the sitter. He said my son's mom came home and was wasted. She was passed out on the couch. Our sitter said he didn't feel okay leaving our son with her. Our son hadn't had dinner and Friday is bath night where I scrub him clean.

I said obviously I can't do anything as I'm about to fly back home and asked if he could stay and watch my son. He said he couldn't. His place is a bit of a commute. Then I asked if he would be open to taking my son back to his place, getting him, getting him fed, giving him a bath and putting him to bed. I'll personally pick my son up and take him to my house. I have him for these two weeks anyways.

Our sitter said he could do that but asked about getting paid. I said I'll pay you for whatever hours you worked. He said if I paid him in cash instead of a check then he'll do the overnight thing for an extra $150 cash. I agreed.

I got back to town at 3am and picked my son up at 4am. I texted my ex about sitter. I saw her at our son's swim meet and she admitted to drinking too much at her office party and apologized to our sitter. 

She asked me for the $150 for the summer camp reimbursement. I said I applied it to pay the sitter for taking Ryan overnight since you couldn't do it yourself. She said that wasn't fair  and we're not squared. I said actually we are. We both paid the same amounts for childcare and camp. That was the agreement.

My partner and I both love video games, but we differ in taste. He loves side scrolling platformers. I don‚Äôt.  He found one yesterday that he thought looked cool. He was excited about it and came to tell me about it while I was in the middle of doing something. He kept showing it to me, but wasn‚Äôt really telling me what it was. He was showing me the graphics and saying that he thought it would be fun to play together. I thought the graphics looked cool and said that I would play with him, as I was assuming it was multiplayer. I don‚Äôt mind playing a game I don‚Äôt like if we are able to play it simultaneously together. 

After he bought the game, he revealed it was 1-player and he essentially just wanted me to sit with him while he played it. He considered this as us ‚Äúplaying together‚Äù because the game ‚Äúhas puzzles‚Äù and he would do all the platforming and have me solve the puzzles. This didn‚Äôt seem fair or enjoyable. He is bad at puzzles and assumed that since I‚Äôm good at them, I would just sit there while he played until he got to a puzzle and he‚Äôd have me figure it out for him.

When I explained this, he got upset and insisted that it wouldn‚Äôt be just him playing. He said we could take turns doing the platforming. The thing is, I hate platformer games! I never play them on my own and I hate watching people play games.

I offered to sit on the couch with him while he played and I played my own game on my handheld. He said that wouldn‚Äôt be us playing together and that he only got this game to play with me.

It feels like he wanted to play this game but didn‚Äôt like the puzzles so he thought he would just have me solve them for him so he could still play the other parts he was interested in.

He said everyone likes to pass the controller during a 1 person game and acted like I was weird and ridiculous. 

He got so upset that he said he didn‚Äôt want to play now and would return it. I asked why he couldn‚Äôt just play it alone and he said he didn‚Äôt want to solve the puzzles.

91,1cpj0wv,AITA for leaving my 80 year old sick dad? ,"To simplify the situation i have to go back in time before i was born, and it is a long story so i will put whatever i can into bullet points.
I (23F) want to work abroad and got an amazing job opportunity that i want to take but my 80 year old dad is sabotaging me and is not supportive, he hopes i regret it and is guilt tripping me to stay to take care of him.

Now lets go back in time: 
-  i was born for child support money because my aunt lied to my mom that she will get a lot of money from the government.
-  she did not get a lot of money from the government so she got salty and dumped the responsibility of me onto my dad. 
-  dad didnt want any more kids (has kids from previous marriage) but mom secretly stopped the pill and poked holes into the condoms so here i am. 
-  dad took over responsibility even though he did not want to. 
-  mom was not present most of my childhood, dad was also very agressive causing me to stutter well into my teenage years, since he scared me.
-  parents were always argueing and i took beatings and lots of verbal abuse.
-  however at the end of the day it was my dad who managed to give me a good education, made sure i had a roof over my head and occasionally got food after school. 
-  since my dad took care of me when he did not want to and gave me an above than average education, i felt like i needed to give something back, so i took care of him since i was 15 (he was 72 by then so he needed the care)

Here is where i think i could be the AH:
-  firstly, i understand my parents situation and understand why everything happened as it is. 
-  mom comes from a poor thai family so saw my german dad as a quick way to get a passport and money.
-  dad wasnt the brigthest marrying my mom (they met 2 times, second time at the wedding) mom was 19 at the wedding and dad 49, yeah.. yikes.. my guess is dad was lonely and saw pretty asian girl and was blinded by love (to put it nicely)
-  as for my dads situation, my half siblings are older than my mom so i understand why they distanced themselves so i think my dad is scared i will leave him like my half siblings did. 
-  now, as you can probably tell, no one is willing to take care of my dad except for me.
-  i am all my dad has, i am all the happiness he has left in his life, if i leave, i am basically ripping his happiness away from him. (He doesnt have friends anymore because he shows agressive behaviour towards them)
-  despite all unfortunate situations i understand where my parents came from and hold no resentment towards them and dont want to worsen my dads health by making him any more depressed than he is. 
-  however my mental health also isnt in peak condition and i want to do something for myself for once. 
-  this is basically a series of unfortunate events which resulted in my dad becoming my child and now as a ""mother"" i feel horrible leaving this big baby with health problems alone for a few years. 

So AITA for taking my dads livelyhood (me) away from him?

94,1cpijuf,AITA for not going to my SIL's milestone birthday and holding a grudge for a whole year?,"So my (21F) brother (26M) is married to SIL (24F). I live in my college dorm which is in a different state from my parents and brother. Brother and SIL stay 5 mins away from my parents. 

So last year, I visited my parents for a week in summer, before going back to my college's state to start my internship. My SIL's birthday was during the week of my visit. She wanted to go on a cruise with my brother for her birthday. So when I announced my dates, she threw a huge stink about how my presence will spoil her birthday plans. Now, I never asked her to change her plans, and they didn't. But she accused me of trying to ruin her birthday, which hurt a lot. They left for their cruise and that was that. I haven't talked to them much since then.

Fast forward to this year, my internship starts earlier, so I planned to visit my parents at the end of summer after it ends. My SIL is turning 25 and my brother is throwing a huge party for her with their her friends and family. I was sent an invite which I declined citing my internship as the reason. But the problem started when my brother called to berate me about not attending such an important party for SIL.

I live in my college dorm which is in a different state from my parents and brother. Brother and SIL stay 5 mins away from my parents. 

So last year, I visited my parents for a week in summer, before going back to my college's state to start my internship. My SIL's birthday was during the week of my visit. She wanted to go on a cruise with my brother for her birthday. So when I announced my dates, she threw a huge stink about how my presence will spoil her birthday plans. Now, I never asked her to change her plans, and they didn't. But she accused me of trying to ruin her birthday, which hurt a lot. They left for their cruise and that was that. I haven't talked to them much since then.

Fast forward to this year, my internship starts earlier, so I planned to visit my parents at the end of summer after it ends. My SIL is turning 25 and my brother is throwing a huge party for her with their her friends and family. I was sent an invite which I declined citing my internship as the reason. But the problem started when my brother called to berate me about not attending such an important party for SIL. I felt a bit petty, so I reminded my brother how SIL made it very clear last year that my presence would ruin her birthday and I didn't want that to happen again this year.

To my surprise, an hour later, they called me to help carry the groceries from the store because they decided to buy additional items not on their original list. Upset, I dropped everything, changed clothes, and rushed to the supermarket. I tried calling my sister twice, but she didn't answer. Finally, when she called back, she questioned why I kept calling her, implying that I could have called our mother instead, and then directed me to where they were waiting.

When I reached them, I was already quite furious and accused them of not respecting my time since they knew they would need my help if they kept adding items to their shopping list.

Later that day, I overheard my mother discussing with my sister that we don't appreciate what she does for us.

96,1cphz8l,AITA for complaining about a grade i got compared to my classmate ?,"Sorry for bad English, I‚Äòm French.

I (16f) recently had one of the biggest exams in our French class about analysations of classic books. We had two weeks to write it and the mark would make or break our whole grade for the year ( Teacher‚Äòs words ). I put a lot of effort into my analysation and wrote 7 pages ( minimum was 5 ). I had family memembers read it over and also got feedback from other teachers. 

My other classmate (16m) asked for inspiration on his paper, so i sent him mine. He ended up writing a very similar one to mine, with the same analysations only worded and structered differently. I want to make it clear that I am not mad at him for ¬´¬†copying¬†¬ª, but for what my teacher did. 

When we got our grades back i got a 9/20 while my classmate got a 18/20. I was shocked since my paper was not bad, but well thought over and grammatically correct. My classmate had the same stuff I had so I was confused as to why his was better. 

I talked to my teacher that i was unsatisfied with my grade and thought that my paper deserved better. She argued that I falsely interpreted most of the text. I told her that this isn‚Äôt a reason, since my classmate had the same, and after that she went quiet and said she would have another look at both of our papers.

The next day she came back and both my and my classmates papers were marked with 15/20. She told us she looked more into it and decided that we both did in fact have the same interpretations and this was the grade we deserved.

Understandably my classmate is now super angry at me, and telling everybody I ruined his grade. I feel bad for getting his grade changed even though it wasnt my intention, but on the other hand the only reason he got that grade was because of me.

97,1cphuxv,AITA for Renting an Apartment Without My Friends After Viewing it With Them and Deciding it was Too Small for All 3 of Us?,"Hey guys, first post on here. I'm 29 years old, and after an awful 5 year breakup, I moved back in with my parents a year ago. It's been really tough living back at home, and I've wanted to get my own place, but apartment prices are super expensive in my area. I have two close friends who were also looking for a new apartment because their current place is too expensive for them to save money, so we agreed to look for one together. Throughout the process, I've urged them to also keep their eyes open for a place that would suit the two of them (they're a couple) and to do what's best for them even if it means getting a place without me. I'd never want them to feel trapped by our agreement or pass up a good opportunity because of me.

Two days ago, we viewed a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment. We all liked it, but once I got home and the initial excitement faded, it hit me how small the place was and how hard it would be to have privacy and sleep well. I go to bed early because I work at a school, and they like to stay up later playing games, and the living room and bathroom are so close to both bedrooms, it seemed too small for all 3 of us and their cat. So I texted them that night to say, I'm sorry, but I think this place is too small for us. They then said that they'd find a place for just the two of them since we couldn't seem to agree on a place that suited all 3 of our needs, which I agreed to. 

That afternoon, though, when I went to the property manager's office to tell her that the apartment was too small for all of us, I told her to keep me in mind if anything else opened up, and she surprised me by offering the apartment to just me if I wanted it since I had put down a deposit already. (The deposit was mine, I didn't ask my friends to help with it, which I didn't mind doing because I make a bit more money than they do.) I crunched the numbers and realized that I could afford it on my own. 

I quickly reached out to my friends to ask for their blessing because I'd love to have this apartment, but I told them that I'd never want it to hurt our friendship. They seem really annoyed with me now, but I've been miserable living with my parents since my big breakup, and this apartment is a perfect opportunity for me. The location makes my work commute way easier, and it's right down the street from the gym I go to every day.

I should also mention that I was getting anxious about living with these friends because we have very, very, very different philosophies on cleaning and decorating, and I was afraid that I would have to argue with them about those things. I didn't want this to hurt our friendship, but I think it has anyway. Taking this apartment is the right move for me, and although it's a complicated situation, I was hoping that my friends would be understanding and supportive.

(We‚Äôre planning on having an American reception in the US in a couple years)
Anyway, my fianc√© asked his cousin who he‚Äôs really close to, to be his best man and he happily accepted. He knew from day one that we would be getting married in Germany and had more than a year to plan for this. 
Originally he had planned to travel to Germany with his wife and young kids but eventually decided that it would be too stressful with the kids and everything going on so his wife and kids would stay home. This was perfectly fine with us, as we understand a transatlantic flight is a lot with two young children. 
After some time, said best man informed us that he too now won‚Äôt be traveling to Germany for the wedding because he has an agreement with his wife where he can leave her alone with the kid for 3 days max. After we asked him if he can‚Äôt just fly to Germany for the weekend of the wedding he said this wasn‚Äôt worth it and too long of a trip. His wife would likely be ok with him flying to Germany for three days and hold the fort down. 
Now our friends who are getting married in the US just a month after us and are so busy, managed to book a stay in Germany just for the weekend to join the wedding. And not once did it cross their minds that this wasn‚Äôt worth it.

I‚Äôm just so incredibly disappointed in his best man for seemingly not even making an effort to be there and so heartbroken for my fianc√© that he won‚Äôt have his best man at our wedding. It‚Äôs definitely not a financial problem as he has told us he will give us a big cash gift instead. I just wish he‚Äôd use that money to book a goddamn flight .

AITA to expect him to make this work and prioritize our wedding? And to hold him to his commitments as a best man, which includes being present at the wedding?

TLDR; Best man won‚Äôt fly to German wedding with the only reasoning being he doesn‚Äôt want too and it‚Äôs too long of a flight for a weekend. Am I the asshole for wanting to confront him and convince him to change his mind?

EDIT; forgot to mention that his brother also got married early March in Mexico where he was also a best man.

103,1cpggng,WIBTA? If i dont let my aunt use my car on mother‚Äôs day since she voluntold me she was going to‚Ä¶,"I (f24) recently had a financial turnaround. After losing my terminally ill mother (technically my grandmother, but she raised me so I call her mom), quitting my job, and becoming homeless, my aunt took me in. Since March, I pay her $300/month to share a bed w her and a bathroom with her son. I'm grateful but sometimes feel taken advantage of, like when she asks for supplies for her business without reimbursing me.

 Despite this, I gave her an early Mother's Day gift‚Äîa $100 Dillard's gift card and B&BW‚Äîto show my appreciation. About a month ago, my aunt took in our mom's car, but it was totaled in a crash. Although it heightened her grief, she's receiving physical therapy (for past body traumas she left the crash completely fine).

 Recently, she voluntold me she had a gig and would use my car. Assuming I'd want to be at home on my day off. I felt this was insensitive given my planned time for grieving. I've decided to work on Sunday to avoid dealing with having my car used without consent. While I appreciate my aunt's support, I've felt like a child living with her, being told what to do and asked about my whereabouts. I long for my independence after living alone for 4 years. 

Would I be the AH if I refuse her request, and how should I tell her this?

EDIT: due to some wording i think i need to clarify a few things. I am not or have ever been a hobo (like living on the streets homeless.) I had to give up my apartment because my job at the time was giving me 10hrs a week. and thats after begging for more. 

during the month of me being jobless i scored a high paying job i can make up to 6 figures a year if i put in the overtime. with a minimum of the high 5 figures being my yearly salary. 

i work 12 hr shifts plus over time so when i have an off day i expect it to be my off day. not spent doing free work for someone else‚Äôs goals. 

Also my aunt is very nice for taking me in but she wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. my car is just all i have and my only boundary is i don‚Äôt want anyone using it.

104,1cpgfkh,WIBTA: Groom inviting toxic friends,"Throwaway for anonymity reasons.

I was invited to one of my good friends weddings as a groomsman. The wedding is set to set to take place several months from now and I already previously accepted the offer and was really excited to go. Until I recently found out that the groom has invited old ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to his wedding & bachelor party. These ‚Äúfriends‚Äù used to treat me & another friend very poorly. They are racist, manipulative, narcissistic (at least one), just not good people all around. They were friends from another time and I cut them out for a reason several years ago due to their toxic nature. The groom knows this.

These past few years, I have been rebuilding my life after healing my childhood trauma, cutting outtoxic people (to include family from my life), & trying to be a better person just every day all around for myself and my family.

I want to tell my friend that while I love him as a brother, I won‚Äôt be attending for the sake of my own moral values. I respect his decision to invite people who he deem as still his friends,but that I will not be attending any wedding events, party, and wedding included to include future events if they are there. I am torn between my decision. In my mind I look at this as going against everything that I have been standing for recently. But also I really care for my friend. I need advice.

TLDR: Would I be the asshole for backing out of my friend wedding and wedding planned events to avoid being around toxic people who I previously cut out? (Groom is aware of who they are and why I cut them out)

An example is that this week we had a nice restautant booked to go to thne my gf decides to but some new clothes and furniture. Once she bought that she then said she can't afford the meal so I'd either have to pay or we'd have to cancel.

I have paid the hotel and travel costs and told my gf I'll be getting our meal when we're there so all she'll need is money for drinks. She said this was fine.

Now she's saying she thinks I'll need to pay for the full night since she's seeing friends next month and has other things to pay for. I told her no and her response was just that we'll have to cancel the night then.

106,1cpg1mo,AITA for asking my housemate to put her puppy in puppy day care on my days off?,"Six months ago my housemate got a 6 week old puppy (a labrador) with separation anxiety. She couldn‚Äôt even go for a shower  because the glass separating them would cause him to howl. He‚Äôs gotten way better since but because he‚Äôs young, his bark is so high-pitched, it‚Äôs like a knife to my brain. 
On top of that he‚Äôs also a puppy so he destroys everything he can get his hands on. I‚Äôve lost multiple plants because of him, a couple of shoes, he‚Äôs ripped apart almost every flyscreen door/window he can reach, the drain pipes, etc. Through all these things, I‚Äôve been the one at home and she‚Äôs been at work. I‚Äôve been the one dealing with the messes he makes. I‚Äôve been putting up with it for 6 months, but this week he broke through the fence and got into the neighbours yard. I had to spend the rest of the day with him on his leash. I couldn‚Äôt do any of the things I‚Äôd had planned because I couldn‚Äôt leave him alone (he‚Äôd either run away or destroy everything). 

I reached my breaking point two days ago and sent her a message asking her to do something about it. Maybe to send him to puppy day care on Monday and Tuesday (my days off from work) when she‚Äôs working. He‚Äôs gone before and absolutely loved it.
Except she‚Äôs also pregnant and money is tight. 

Today, she (34F), her baby daddy (~38M) and I (24F) sat down. It started with me saying all I have here, calmly, to which she responded by saying that he‚Äôs still just a puppy and he‚Äôll grow out of it. I reiterated that I understand that, but the issues are now and something needs to be done now. Not when he becomes an adult. She just kept repeating that he‚Äôll grow out of it
From there it just went downhill to the point where the baby daddy and I were snapping at each other. He said I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion and need to suck it up. That when I agreed to let my housemate have a dog, I agreed to him destroying everything. That me not realising this would happen is just me being naive, and taking responsibility for HER dog when she‚Äôs at work is necessary because I just need to take it for the team. 
I told him he wasn‚Äôt listening to what I was saying. I don‚Äôt want them to get rid of the puppy or anything. I just want the puppy and his messes to not be my responsibility on my days off work. 
Meanwhile my housemate didn‚Äôt say a thing after that first comment. She sat there while he snapped at me for half an hour and she didn‚Äôt even look at me while I was sobbing (frustrated tears). 

All I was asking for was them to understand what I‚Äôm feeling and try to come to a compromise we can all be okay with. Instead I was told to just suck it up and stop being so childish.

When I asked I told her how out of everyone in my life, she was there, always. She was there when I was born and learning to walk and talk. She was there when dad died and I was so sad and afraid that she let me sleep in her bed for close to two years. She put me first when she held off on dating for a whole two years because she knew I wasn't ready. She was there for me when she asked me what I thought of the man she would marry when I was 10 and when she assured me I didn't have to call him dad. She was there when I struggled in school, when I was being relentlessly bullied and when I was sick. She was there. She loved me. She supported me. She gave me all her love and affection and made sure that losing my dad didn't mean I could no longer have a good life. She taught me so much and I love her more than words can express.

My mom cried and said yes. She was a mess for the rest of the day and apparently she even broke down at work the very next day and sobbed her heart out with joy. We've since planned everything about this special role of hers and she's even going to have some details of her dress match mine.

My stepdad, who came into my life and married my mom when I was 10, I asked if he'd like to do a toast during the wedding and dance with my mom in a special little dance alongside my fianc√©'s parents. Originally he said yes. But then afterward he quizzed my mom on what we were doing and he became upset that he wasn't more involved in the wedding and getting a bigger spot. He told me he considers me his youngest (he has three kids from before he met my mom who were grown when he and my mom married so they're strangers to me) and he would have thought I considered him a second dad.  I told him I appreciated all he had done for us but my mom had always been there for me and it was her I wanted with me for my wedding because she has been with me always.

He didn't like it and he and my mom got into a fight over it. Mom actually spent a couple of nights with my fianc√© and me. My stepdad told me he wasn't feeling like one of my parents. And I don't consider him my parent. But I didn't want to be a jerk to him either. Then my mom's parents got involved and they asked why I needed just my mom and not both. My stepdad said not being offered more made him feel like he wasn't wanted at the wedding at all. He complained that he wasn't even paying for the wedding like a typical father of the bride would. And he pointed out that I was going traditional enough to walk and dance with a parent but away from tradition by asking mom instead of him. He also expressed that anything I offer after this would feel shallow and like I'm throwing him a bone instead of wanting him there.

She threw a big fit about how it's just because my dad is stingy, he never does anything for her, and I ""always"" take his side (not true). She then gave us the silent treatment and went outside.

Anyways WIBTA for taking my dads side and was my dad the asshole for not wanting to drive her home in the first place?

But my mom is super adamant that my dad drives all the way to the capital, picks her up and drives her back home. Me and my dad think it's extremely dumb, unnecessary and a waste of time.

She threw a big fit about how it's just because my dad is stingy, he never does anything for her, and I ""always"" take his side (not true). She then gave us the silent treatment and went outside.  
And yes my parents do have a lot of issues with each other but they're both at fault. Imo they're just incompatible and should split up, because I'm tired of their stupid arguments over nothing every day.

Anyways WIBTA for taking my dads side and was my dad the asshole for not wanting to drive her home in the first place?

Edit: I love how my comments pointing out how what she did was verbal abuse get downvoted automatically. She's obviously justified to do whatever she wants to us just because we were midly inconsiderate. Shame on you people. 

Edit 2: Either way thank you for your responses. Though I may disagree on some things I will think about your points and do an introspection

Edit 3: Although screw all the people telling me I'm wrong for daring to feel hurt by my parents. Yes their constant arguments and treatment of me which I won't get into has indeed affected me. I may be the asshole here but you guys invalidating me seriously fucking suck!",1.0,1.0623787641525269,1,1
110,1cpdemp,"AITA for telling my family to shut up, get over themselves and to accept that I never wanted my son to have the names they like?","My wife (25f) and I (26m) welcomed our son Callum into the world just over a week ago. I had expected our son's name wouldn't be a favorite among my family but I had believed and hoped they would just love us enough to accept that the name isn't one of the more vintage/old timey names my family loves. But they expressed their dislike for the name immediately and were asked to leave by me because my wife was in recovery and didn't need to deal with their bullshit. They called me up the next day and asked why we had gone so different from the rest of the family. I told them we went with a name we both loved and felt would work for our son his entire life.

My family told me Callum is not the kind of name a person should wear into adulthood. That it ages terribly because it sounds like a little boys name. I told them Callum is a well established and long used name, just not in the way they like for names to be. They told me Callum does not compare to the names my nieces and nephews have or that my siblings have, I used to have another name and changed it at 18.

So before I get too carried away I should say that the types of names my family like are; Reginald, Harold, Desmond, Bartholomew, Maximilian, Clarence and my old name Herbert. Girls names are the same old school style. My family loves that. I'm good with that. I wasn't good with my old name and changed it and I didn't want a name for my son that ""fit"" with them.

I told my family as they were complaining to me that we had decided and the name was not changing so they should adjust to it. They were quiet for a day and then they got back in touch to say they could not bring themselves to accept this and that I should really consider why they love the names they do. They said I damned myself when I changed my name, which is now Jamie, but I shouldn't do that to my son. When I didn't budge they declared they would talk to my wife. I told them no way in hell are they bothering my wife with their crap when she's newly PP. We got into a fight and I told them to stop calling if they couldn't let it go.

They showed up yesterday to see our son again and I wasn't going to let them inside but my wife, who knows what's been going on, thought maybe seeing Cal again would calm them down. It didn't. They started on the name shit again and they did attempt to go through my wife which is when I may have stepped over the line. I told them to shut up and get over themselves about the name because my wife and I love it and we're not changing it for them and they need to accept I never wanted my son or any kids I'd have to have names they like. I told them they knew that from the time I went to the effort and cost to change my own name. And I told them they had gone too far trying to pester my wife after being warned not to.

They said I didn't need to be so rude to get my point across and I believe I did. But I'm also doubting if I went too far.

112,1cpd6a5,AITA For getting frustrated at my partners lazy attitude towards chores?,"So for a little context, I (21M) am from England and have gone abroad to visit my (F19) partner. So while im not working I've been helping her family upkeep the house or do chores with neighbours and friends to support myself. We have been together for 2 years now and things have been going relatively smoothly. However recently I've been glossing over a lot of the things she does and to her parents and it's now starting to tick me off.

Before I flew over to see her, I've constantly hear over the phone arguments between my partner and her parents for her lack of attitude towards what they ask her to do but she always reassured me that things would be better once I got there.

But cut to us living together for the past year and things are getting rather difficult.
She is being asked to do simple jobs like taking dishes to the dishwasher or cleaning a cage of her MANY pets. Just for the parents to be hit with the same answer of ""Yes, il do it"" over and over again while she sits with her phone glued to her eyes. Until eventually enough time has past that someone else has done it because it became too much of a problem.

Normally this was between her parents and rarely with me so I didn't think too much of it. I talked to her about it and said she probably shouldn't do that because I can see how that would frustrate them, but she keeps brushing it off.

Today she came off work and asked me relax her after a hard day at work. Now I'd been dog sitting for her all day today and I had a horrible back injury from shovelling a garden the day prior. So I asked her politely if she could please let the dogs out tonight as I was in pain. I was told ""Yes, il do it"" with her phone in hand.

Nearly 2 hours later, she falls asleep because she is ""Too tired"" so I have to get up and let them out and clean the mess they left behind. I explain my frustration to her and she said ""I had a long day and I was tired"". Keep in mind whenever she works, she frequently asks for me to come down and help her with her job by cleaning tables or taking food orders. But I let her off this time because she was tired. So despite being annoyed, I swallowed it and went to sleep.

Now I've woken up to her sat on her phone scrolling tiktok for 3 hours, that pushes me past my level of tolerance and we had a minor argument about it. Now she is sat on the couch upstairs cooling off because I snapped at her. Am I the asshole here?

113,1cpc6vu,AITA for confronting my flatmate about jumping in the shower before me?,"For almost a year now, I've been waking up early to use the bathroom so my routines don't clash with anyone else, but my flatmate often changes her routines. I shower at night to minimize my bathroom time in the morning. This week, I noticed my flatmate rushing to the bathroom before me. The other day, she jumped out of bed when she heard my alarm, and even though I got up slightly later, she still hurried to use the bathroom. This happened again when I switched off my alarm, and she quickly left the toilet to shower as soon as she heard me unlocking my bedroom door.

After thinking about it, I decided to address the issue. I knocked on the bathroom door, but she didn't respond, so I spoke to her through the door, asking why she rushed to use the bathroom before me. She mentioned her work schedule but didn't acknowledge my routine. I explained that I wake up early to avoid waiting and that I shower at night to be considerate. She responded dismissively, saying she was already in the bathroom.

Later, she sent a text complaining about how I approached the situation, stating that a shower only takes 10 minutes (while she took 20) and implying that I was causing unnecessary conflict. This isn't the first time she's been confrontational, and she often dismisses my concerns or treats me as passive-aggressive.

While I could have addressed the issue at a different time, I felt frustrated and believed her behavior was intentional. I want to feel comfortable in my own home and have fair access to communal spaces without feeling rushed or dismissed.

So, was it wrong of me to confront my housemate about rushing to the bathroom?

115,1cpblea,AITA for forgetting where I'd left my bike and causing my sister to miss opera,"Last week I asked my sister If she would try to repair my bicycle's bell. I told her I would probably leave it at a certain spot at Universitiy, not far away from the place I'd usually leave it for the weekend. She'd borrowed mine before because she hasn't made her own rideable yet, but didn't tell me she intended to use it over the weekend. 

One week later: I'm on a trip and my sister calls me. She asks where my bike is, she needs it and it's not at the spot I told her. About 5 minutes into the call I remember I've actually moved it like 100 m away, still at Uni. We talk for another 10 minutes while she tries to find it, unsuccessfully. Then she starts crying: Her event starts in half an hour. I am like: What?! Turns out she has a ticket for the opera (maybe worth 20-40‚Ç¨). 

When she gets more and more hysterical, I suddenly freeze. And it comes to me. I didn't leave the bike at Uni AT ALL. I rode it home to my dorm late at night, me being tired and a bit drunk, that's probably the reason why I totally forgot that it happened. 

She, somehow crying and shouting at the same time, says: ""Are you kidding me, now I'm not going to make it"", hangs up and I don't hear from her again. I start to send her texts how unfair she treated me: That I was sorry for forgetting this but that she'd not been caring for her bike for months and was using mine, the better one, instead the whole time. If she'd told me earlier that she needed my bike for the opera, I'd probably remembered in time I left it at my dorm. 

Finally, she texts back, claiming that she didn't put any blame on me and I should stop making her evening worse than it is (she missed about one third of the show). Well, she didn't with words, but she's just been so upset that I felt (and still feel) like shit. And knowing her well, I honestly believe she thinks I'm an asshole for this. 

If I hadn't forgotten I moved the bike, despite telling her otherwise - before and during the phone call - she maybe wouldn't have missed the beginning of the opera. She also put herself in great danger because she must have went at mad speed in the end. On the other hand she ruined MY evening as well by calling so close to the event, causing me a lot of stress and a very hurting bad conscience, not to forget she's got her own bike but is to lazy to pump up the tires.

117,1cpatq0,AITA for not wanting to share a room with my brother ,"Throwaway. I (16M) live at home with my brother (13M) and parents. Although my brother has his own bedroom, he never sleeps alone in it. For the past few years, he‚Äôs slept with my mom almost every night, while my dad slept in a different room, since there‚Äôs no bed in our house that can accommodate three people.

Since my mom works until pretty late at night, sometimes he would sit in bed for hours just watching videos on his iPad until she came to sleep. He would always say that ""he couldn't sleep until she came."" I've always thought it was just an excuse he used to excessively use electronics like he already did, and had been telling my parents for some time now to at least try and make him sleep by himself in his room-- partly so he isn't staying up until 11:30 watching videos, but also because I felt bad for my parents. He's told us before that it's not that he's scared of the dark, but that he gets ""bored"" when he sleeps by himself. My parents told me since he was sleeping with them that it shouldn't bother me, so I left it alone.¬†

One night a few weeks ago my dad had a huge argument with my mom about how they don't spend time together like a normal couple, and that they don't even sleep together. He was very upset about it, to the point where he was screaming and ended up locking himself in his room. Ever since then, my mom told me that I needed to sleep with my brother. At first I asked her why she couldn't at least try and make my brother sleep in the room that he has already, but after he started whining and saying that he didn‚Äôt like doing that, she told me that ‚Äúhe was her baby‚Äù and to shut up and go with it if I didn't want my parents to end up getting a divorce. So, I did. Now, I'm almost 17 years old. My room is my personal space, and having my brother sleep here means that that‚Äôs all gone. If we were in a living-situation where this had to be done, or he truly could not manage to be alone, I would not protest, but none of those are the case, so it feels very unnecessary to take my space away. Now and then I'll ask my parents why they won't at least try and have him sleep in his room for one night because he‚Äôs never even tried. They'll refuse the idea, and start getting angry at me for being difficult and spoiled.¬†

Last night I asked my mom again, and she told me that wasn‚Äôt going to happen because my brother doesn‚Äôt want to. I told her that he was old enough and at this point she was just listening to him because he makes a much bigger fit than I do when he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants, and that maybe I should start doing that too so she‚Äôd listen to me. She then told me I was completely ungrateful, so I snapped and went downstairs to sleep there instead. My brother still refused to sleep alone so she ended sleeping with him, and my dad was not happy about it. I genuinely don‚Äôt think my parents are being reasonable by not having him sleep by himself even once, but maybe I overreacted last night. AITA for refusing to sleep with him? 

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-11,"AITA for not wanting to share a room with my brother  Throwaway. I (16M) live at home with my brother (13M) and parents. Although my brother has his own bedroom, he never sleeps alone in it. For the past few years, he‚Äôs slept with my mom almost every night, while my dad slept in a different room, since there‚Äôs no bed in our house that can accommodate three people.

Since my mom works until pretty late at night, sometimes he would sit in bed for hours just watching videos on his iPad until she came to sleep. He would always say that ""he couldn't sleep until she came."" I've always thought it was just an excuse he used to excessively use electronics like he already did, and had been telling my parents for some time now to at least try and make him sleep by himself in his room-- partly so he isn't staying up until 11:30 watching videos, but also because I felt bad for my parents.

She can also be pretty controlling and has even gone as far as taking some of my back up antidepressants out of my car (incase I forget to take them omw to work) without asking and lectured me about how that's not ok even though they were in a prescription bottle. Then she acts like because I take SSRIs that im disabled and have to be taken care of even though I'm one semester away from getting into nursing school and work full-time.

120,1cp9qwb,AITA for Confronting My Dad About His Lack of Support?,"Hey everyone,

I (22F) recently had a heated argument with my dad, and I'm feeling conflicted about whether I was in the wrong. 

Background: Throughout my life, my dad has always been distant and somewhat aloof. He's never been very emotionally supportive, and I often felt like I had to seek validation elsewhere. I've tried to brush it off, telling myself that's just how he is, but it's always bothered me deep down.

The Incident: Last week, I landed a promotion at work after years of hard work. I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to share the news with my family. When I told my dad, his reaction was underwhelming, to say the least. He barely acknowledged it and quickly changed the subject. I was hurt and disappointed by his lack of enthusiasm.

The Confrontation: I couldn't let it go this time. I confronted him about his behavior, expressing how his lack of support over the years has affected me. I poured my heart out, telling him how much I've craved his approval and encouragement. Instead of apologizing or trying to understand, he got defensive and accused me of being oversensitive. 

Now I'm left wondering if I overreacted. Was it wrong of me to call him out on his behavior? Should I just accept that he'll never be the supportive dad I've always wished for? Or am I justified in expecting more from him?

My friend, let's call him Bob, (16M), assumed the role of Vice President, and it was a really fun time with a small group of kids.



Now, since it's my senior year and there were some complications with credits that I received with previous schooling, and the fact that my mom had to go in for major surgery, I got really busy around the middle of the school year and kinda dropped the ball with the gaming club. It was a small group of kids, and everything was running smoothly so no problem. But then the teacher that we had running the club said she was leaving to teach in Japan, so the club was now faced with the problem of finding a new teacher.



Bob got on my case a lot during those months because he felt like I wasn't doing enough to support the club, to which I responded multiple times that I was busy with different things. It got to the point that our friendship got really strained, and he started claiming to be developing heart issues over the teacher situation? It was a mess, but I tried to do things here and there when I thought to, and we got a new teacher so everything turned out alright.



Shortly after, one of the kids in the club, and my friend, Lucky (18M), had something really bad happen to him. This sparked a controversy with the whole group because apparently Lucky had made some questionable relationship choices, but he was my friend so I stood by him. Bob made a really bad comment about Lucky right after learning what had happened, so I yelled at him and told him not to talk about someone like that. He confronted me later about the comment, made a couple of justifications about how it was a joke (which someone else confirmed), said he didn't know, but then told me off again for not committing to the club, ending with the fact that our friendship was over.

I‚Äôm not making any more plans or setting up any more events that she can flake on, hurting my kids again. When I spoke to my dad‚Äôs brother about this, he told me I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing. He said I should support my mother unconditionally and not keep my kids away from her.  I say I‚Äôm protecting my kids. He says I‚Äôm turning my back on family. AITA?

He doesn‚Äôt have any pets, but grew up with dogs. I have two cats that made the move with me.

My boyfriend obviously knew about the cats, but when he would stay with me at my apartment, the cats found it weird and didn‚Äôt like being in the room and cuddling with me while he was there.

Now that we moved in, they‚Äôve figured out my boyfriend is here to stay so they‚Äôve come back into the bedroom at night.

Long story short, it‚Äôs been an adjustment. They do typical cat thing, zoomies at weird points in the night, random meowing at some godforsaken hour, but I‚Äôm used to it after owning cats for god knows how long.

My boyfriend however is upset, and finally reached his breaking point the other day, and told me I needed to either move the cats out of the bedroom at night, or he would be sleeping in the guest room for the foreseeable future. I told him to get over it, and that if he had a dog that took up space on the bed and I wanted it out, would he oblige? He said no it was a different circumstance.

128,1cp8hv8,AITA for setting boundaries with my friends?,"AITA for setting boundaries with my friends?

I‚Äôm a 23F and I‚Äôm married with a 22 month old. I have mostly  single, childfree friends which is the norm for my age. I am usually busy with work, spending time with my immediate family and of course my daughter, and I always try to make time to spend with friends, especially my best friends as much as possible. 

My husband went on a trip and I am mostly at home with my daughter or with other family, and here and there, when I am able I will see my friends. However, since my husband left, they think thats an invitation to hang out late every night , talk/text 24/7 at odd times at night (facetime calls at midnight), and sleepovers. 

Even though I‚Äôve been mostly complacent, its really getting to me now. I hate sleepovers. I cant stand sleeping next to anyone but my husband, and having to cater to and provide a guest with entertainment, meals and round the clock care for my daughter is my personal nightmare. 

So that being said, when my friends are being pushy about hanging out more or having them sleep over when I KNOW I‚Äôll be doing everything (cleaning, cooking etc) on top of caring for my daughter, I‚Äôd rather not do that every day. Also, my daughter wakes up at 6 AM every morning, so if im running around all day, staying up until god knows when entertaining guests and having no sleep, am I an asshole for outright telling my friends to go home, not to sleepover even if theyre planning on staying late and not wanting to hang out even though I technically ‚Äúcan‚Äù and I have more free time? It‚Äôs getting exhausting, but my friends make me feel like shit for sending them home, or not wanting to be in constant contact?

129,1cp8cq4,AITA for putting w33d in the keef chamber,"my friend and I are both big smokers. We just got an ounce today and while he's grinding some bud for us to smoke I asked him if I could grind some in MY grinder to put it in the keef chamber. for those of you who aren't familiar a grinder has 3 compartments (unless it's super cheap and made of plastic), one at the top to put the bud in, it's got spikes on the inside and that part twists to grind up the bud. The second chamber directly below that one holds the ground weed, and those are the main two that people use. The third and bottom chamber is really thin and collects the super tiny fine weed, which is called keef. keef bowls go crazy. 
anyways I like to store regular ground weed in my keep chamber as a backup, if I run out I still have a little left in my grinder. 
My friend misunderstood me and thought I wanted to grind the weed that we were about to smoke in my grinder instead of his so that the keef would build up, but not store it in my grinder. he has no issue with me keeping/storing the weed, but he called me crazy and a psychopath for storing weed on the keef chamber and expecting him to know what I meant, even though I feel I was very explicit when I said I wanted to KEEP the weed IN the keef chamber.

130,1cp82dv,AITA for going away without my partner for Memorial Day weekend?,"My partner and I have been together since 2020. Prior to us getting together, we had our own ‚Äútraditions‚Äù for Memorial Day Weekend. My partner enjoys going to a special picnic every year for the past 20 or so years and I have gone on a weekend trip every year for the past 15 years or so. 

My partner‚Äôs picnics started back up in 2022 and my partner asked me to go. I told my partner that I always go away for the weekend, but I said I would go to the picnic. I did explain for only a few hours because being around a lot of people I don‚Äôt know gives me a lot of anxiety and drains my battery. My partner goes to this picnic for 10+ hours. 

On the way to the picnic, we started fighting because I thought it‚Äôd be fair that once in awhile my partner gives up the picnic and goes away with me. It got so heated, I just dropped off my partner and picked my partner back up later. 

Last year, I asked my partner if we could compromise. One year go to the picnic the entire time and the following year, go away for the weekend. My partner did not want that compromise stating that this picnic has been a huge deal for years. I also stated going away to start off the summer has been a big deal to me for years. I told my partner that I wanted to go away and they got angry because I didn‚Äôt want to be next to them at the picnic so in turn, I was angry that we couldn‚Äôt come up with a compromise and my partner didn‚Äôt want me to go away so I didn‚Äôt go away and didn‚Äôt go to the picnic.

Now, Memorial Day Weekend is approaching and I ask my partner again if we can come to a compromise between going away and the picnic. My offer again was to switch every other year, first year picnic(for the entire picnic)-following year go away(no picnic). My partner said no. So I asked if they had any compromise ideas that they felt was fair. They said that they feel they should be able to continue to go to the picnic and have me next to them there. I said that doesn‚Äôt sound fair to me because I can‚Äôt do what I‚Äôve always enjoyed doing so this year I‚Äôm going away to visit a friend.

My partner is upset with me because instead of going to the picnic, I‚Äôm going away for 3 days. I said the past 2 years I haven‚Äôt gone anywhere and we can‚Äôt come to a compromise so we are both happy. Since my partner won‚Äôt give up the picnic, I feel I shouldn‚Äôt have to give up my trips.
