0,1cpppva,AITA: my sister's wedding is today and there's a huge issue between my parents and I over the haircut they made me get,"I'm a 24 y/o trans man. I came out to immediate family when I was 19 and haven't asked anyone to call me by my correct name/pronouns because it will upset the peace. My parents were very hurt when I came out so I don't bring it up.

There's been a pattern of my parents controllingwhat happens to my body rather than me. Antidepressants at 13. Strict diet at 14 (low carbs, low calories, stomach injections, had to eat lunch alone in the school counselor's office). I stopped seeing a stylist my mom knew personally after asking for a 'boy haircut' and the stylist wouldn't go against my mom, who was embarrassed/angry. When I asked to wear a tie with my school uniform, my dad said only if I wore makeup. I still sucked my thumb at 12, and my parents had a dentist put in a device with a grid of metal wires against the roof of my mouth; every time I'd eat, pieces would get stuck between it and the top of my mouth. To my parents' credit they had this thing taken out pretty quickly. When I was 14-ish I stopped shaving my legs, so my dad would forcibly shave them with his electric razor and threaten to take my phone away if I refused.

My sister's wedding is today. Three days ago, I got a haircut. I'd known I wanted it short, so I texted my sister to ask if she was okay with that, which she was. My mom didn't want my hair too short though, and when I went to get the cut (from another stylist she knows), she said she hoped I would respect her wishes. The stylist did what my mom had told her, not me; my mom was the customer even though it was my hair. I left with a haircut that made me feel more like an object than a person.

For that day, and the next day, I stayed in my room at my parents' house and wouldn't show my hair. I know that sounds dramatic but I've experienced disrespect towards my body for years, and this haircut was feminine, which added dysphoria on top of it. My mom was worried, but my dad was angry. He accused me of wanting to 'make a statement' (about my gender) and make my sisters' big day about me.

Yesterday my mom and I had a talk about the pattern I explained and we both felt better after. I helped her set up at the venue and she said that I could get my hair touched up a little. But when my dad found out about that, he was really mad, called me to order me not to do it, and when I turned it into a three-way call with my mom who said she was okay with it, he said he didn't care and that I wasn't allowed to get it cut again.

When he got home he made the same accusations as before. I told him about the conversation with my mom and said that after the wedding he could be brought into that, but he demanded I explain everything right then. I didn't want to because I didn't trust him to listen or respect what I said without my mom there. I wouldn't get into it, and tried to tell him we should just make today about my sister, but he was disgusted with me and told me not to even bother coming to the wedding.

2,1cp7zi6,AITA for getting mad about a reserved cake my family ate?,"Edit: please stop suggesting laxatives

I (16) learned on May 8th that my friend was sick and not feeling well, so I dug out a cake mix and made it for her. Her family wasn't able to pick it up immediately because it was pretty spontaneous and they had stuff going on, so we decided to have one half of the cake and save the rest for my friend.

Pretty much right after I was done baking and frosting, my grandpa, who has a sweet tooth stronger than anyone else I know, even me, came and ate pretty much all of our half immediately. I wasn't bothered by this, since I got some too and it really was a good cake. Then I put foil on my friend's half, a note that explicitly said ""do not eat"" on it, and put it in the fridge.

May 10th - It hasn't been a full 48 hours and the other half is already eaten into and probably going to be gone soon. I went over to another friend's house for a few hours, and my family ate a noticeable part of it while I was unable to protect it. Worse, when I got home my grandma admitted she told my grandpa to cut it thin so I wouldn't notice. Then when I tried telling her that was rude and I needed another mix so I could replace it, she called my grandpa and he yelled at me for being mad over a cake.

What I'm angry about isn't so much the cake being eaten, but the fact that we all knew what the arrangement was, and that I was trying to make a kind gesture for my sick friend. Then they just carelessly went and ate more than their fair share, even though they already *had* a part of the cake they could have saved.

Firstly am a guy.

Some people have been asking for an update and I have talked to my sister and I actually feel bad because I painted her in a bad light because I was upset with where our conversation was going and  wanted a validating opinion. But after talking to her, she home for the summer now. I realized how little she has, like 50 dollars is what covers her hygiene products and school materials. And she really feels excluded from experiences and she just wanted to experience a fun night with her friends without worrying about money and I think that pretty valid. I think we both overreacted. Anyways me and my sister talked about finance I explained to her where my money goes and also made it clear that I think we should get a loan for what she has to pay next year. This is not to punish her but I chatted with someone on here and I realized how dangerous it was for me to have  nothing saved up. I used all my saving on her tuition so am just not in the best position to give right now. I can‚Äôt be living paycheck to paycheck when am a guardian of 2 other people you know. I am gonna ask a family member first if they can Loan it to us but if not we will just have to do it the official way. But I do believe that she is gonna receive a refund next semester but we still have to think of living accommodations and groceries. I am not gonna show her this post because a lot of you weren‚Äôt really nice with your delivery and went as far as to compare her to my mom which for us is the most hurtful thing you can say. She gonna work this summer. (She said she couldn‚Äôt  work in school because of her schedule and how spread out her classes are. ) I also called my friend that a graduate to talk to my sister about school resources because I really don't know much about that stuff. 


As for me  am doing okay, like I was gonna do a cna program because it free but I think am gonna save for an emt program instead, I don‚Äôt think the pay is much different from what am doing now but I assume that for a job like that there are benefits like insurance plus it more noble I guess. Kind of scared because I wasn‚Äôt the smartest In school but the only requirement was a diploma so wish me luck.

Edit: As to why I resent her: She was emotionally neglectful during my adolescence and emotionally abusive. Said a lot of things that made me feel worthless and to this day I struggle with the negative voices of her words. Her excuse was that she was under a lot of stress, which I don't deny.  Still She was an adult, I was a kid, I didn't deserve it.

I also had lots of years where I had unexplained health issues like headaches and insomnia and she tried to convince me they were in my head, that it was due to depression/anxiety instead of helping me find the ""real problem"". I eventually found the problem by myself but wasted many years thinking I had a mental illness. NOW today i actually do have depression because of this whole thing. She caused my depression

She has since then ""changed"" and tries to say positive words and always encourage me but it's just too late and I can't seem to let it go.

Still She was an adult, I was a kid, I didn't deserve it.

I also had lots of years where I had unexplained health issues like headaches and insomnia and she tried to convince me they were in my head, that it was due to depression/anxiety instead of helping me find the ""real problem"". I eventually found the problem by myself but wasted many years thinking I had a mental illness. NOW today i actually do have depression because of this whole thing. She caused my depression

She has since then ""changed"" and tries to say positive words and always encourage me but it's just too late and I can't seem to let it go. I needed her support when I was 14, not now when I'm an old. I've wasted half of my life, I really hate myself and I can't help but think it's mostly all her fault.",3.0,0.1302729,0,0

10,1cp625g,AITA for not listening to my aunt's complaints?,"This incident happened a few months ago. I (35F) was at my niece's wedding, staying with my brother (53M). The wedding was not for his daughter, but he lived in the same area and it was cheaper than getting a hotel, since flying to his city in Alabama was already expensive enough. So, the night before, we had the reception party, and all of us ended up getting back home having drunk quite a bit and sleeping late.

So late that our parents rolled in before any of us had really gotten up. I got up first because I'm usually an early riser. After talking to mom and dad, they had eaten breakfast, but I realized me, my brother, and his wife had not. Since I was getting hungry, I asked mom and dad if they would take me to a local shop to get a some breakfast sandwiches. As we were about to leave, our aunt and uncle rolled in. Note: Aunt and uncle were staying in the same hotel as mom and dad, so they ate breakfast together. Dad let them know we were going off to get some breakfast for me, and they'd be back.

Cue, I get mom and dad some starbucks to thank them for letting me borrow their car, and some chicken and biscuits for me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We get back, with all of them finally up, and I dish out the chicken and biscuits to them, and my aunt IMMEDIATELY starts pitching a fit. ""Why didn't you buy me one?""

Later, my brother tries to intervene and explain what happened, to which my aunt goes off, in front of me, ""Well it was selfish and inconsiderate!"" And my tactic when it comes to this sort of verbal abuse is to disengage. So I said, ""Okay, then,"" and immediately left and went back to my room.

After this, my brother pulled me aside and said me doing that proved my aunt right and I should have just stayed put. It was rude and assholish of me to just walk away.

I started renting from a family member with my RM (for privacy we‚Äôre in our mid 20s, qu**r, and dgaf about prounouns so I‚Äôll use she/her) about 2 years ago. Housing market sucks and with us both part-time, it was all we could afford.

RM is diagnosed with ADHD (not medicated), I am on the autism spectrum. Our families are not wealthy. I managed to get my associates on my own, she has a high school diploma, so we‚Äôre laughably unhireable for a job that pays more than minimum wage.
When we moved I attempted to establish what I thought were reasonable rules for the house since it was in the family and I didn‚Äôt want it to get trashed. No food kept in the bedrooms because we live in the country and rodents exist, and the house has a pantry and kitchen with plenty of space. I made with a cleaning list to take turns on to keep us things tidy and honestly it could‚Äôve been way worse. Just things like taking turns on dishes, trash, vacuuming once a week. Easy to keep track of and not time-consuming, does not have to be sparkling.
RM agreed to the chore list, but immediately the rules weren‚Äôt followed. Any sort of mess you can think of, it happened for months and I always had to ask her to participate and take her turn. Trash, moldy dishes for weeks, etc, didn‚Äôt do it without me asking. I got sick of it and started doing it all myself.
It really irks me because when we moved I was working 40 hrs a week (Assistant Manager at one job and night shift at the other job we shared), she only worked an average of 14-20 hrs a week, and then I came home to clean between shifts and on my days off.
Then after a few months RM brought to my attention that she thinks that my cleaning rules are ‚Äúextreme‚Äù and that she doesn‚Äôt think that food in her room will attract any pests. I didn‚Äôt have the capacity to argue with her at that point so I just let her do whatever and figured she would learn. She did not.

Idk if it‚Äôs ADHD or her past home life, she either willfully doesn‚Äôt notice things around her or genuinely doesn‚Äôt notice them, either way I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask.

I have never really fit in with others and don't click super well with others my age because I have very different values/morals/ethics from a lot of people my age in this day and age. Therefore I told my mum that she can invite the parents of a few families and their kids who are 18+ to the party as I don't want kids running around the restaurant and other teenagers just sitting there on their phones. My mother called me difficult and unreasonable for wanting to do this and has gone on so many rants being like ""What am I going to tell people about them not being able to bring their kids?"" I told her that she shouldn't care what other people think, it's my birthday party and everyone who is invited has me on social media, if they want an answer to that question then there is nothing stopping them from sending me a message on social media and that I would be more than happy to reply to them providing them with an explanation.

Last year was a really bad birthday for reasons that I won't get too into but something important to note is that I don't want to say it was traumatic because that would be self diagnosing and I don't want to be doing that and throwing words around but the memories of that birthday were blocked from my brain for a bit and it took me months to be able to remember things from that night and still I don't know if I will ever be able to remember everything. Therefore I was not planning on doing anything for my birthday this year until the news came out about my grandfather having cancer so now I feel obligated to have a party incase God forbid this is the last one he is alive for. I don't want this year to be a repeat of last year which is why I am being so strict on the guest list as I don't want to go ever go through the stress of wondering if my brain will ever allow me to remember the events of that night (there was lots of alcohol involved, screaming, putting on a happy front etc) at my 17th birthday.

I get where my mum is coming from in the sense that it will be a bit awkward letting them know that their kids won't be invited but as I already said to her, I am more than happy to have that conversation with them if they chose to confront me about it. So AITA?

UPDATE: I am allowing the families to bring their kids, hoping and praying that they're on their best behaviour. I need to forgive people for last years mistakes and give them a second chance.

It was wrong of my to wish to only give the adults a second chance. While I don't agree with the delivery of some of the comments I can see where you are coming from :)",1.0,1.0598882,1,1
17,1cp5aly,WIBTA For Asking My Roommate to Help With My Moving Costs Because He Asked Me To Move Out Early,"My roommate has asked me to move out of our 2 bedroom apartment at the end of May so his new wife can move in with him instead. For context, I moved into this apartment in September after subleasing from his former roommate. He has been in this apartment for at least 2 years. In December, we resigned a 15 month lease with both of our names on the lease so I am no longer subleasing.

When I originally agreed to move in, I was told that I wouldn't have to leave until I was ready to do so. I was also told that my current roommate would probably move before I did as he was planning on getting another job in a different state once he finished his master's degree. Back in March, he left to go to his home country for a month. While he was there, he got married, which he didn't tell me before he left. When he got back, we talked and he mentioned that his wife was probably going to come here at some point in the future but that was all we talked about. 

A little more than a week ago, at the beginning of May, he asked me to move out. I've thought about it and I've decided to go ahead with moving out, mainly because I'll be working elsewhere for 2 months over the summer so it'll save me some rent and allow me to make a clean start when I get back. I know that I have no requirement to do so, but his wife is coming one way or another and I don't want to end up in a living situation where no one else is happy with me. Plus, aside from this, he's been a very good roommate so I wish him no ill will.

  
My question is, WIBTA for asking him to help with the costs of moving since he's asking me to move out 5 months into a 15 month lease? I don't exactly have the money saved up to move since I wasn't expecting this. I would like to hire movers as I am sick and tired of constantly moving. I also plan on asking for my half of the security deposit back from him.",TL;DR,2024-05-11,"WIBTA For Asking My Roommate to Help With My Moving Costs Because He Asked Me To Move Out Early My roommate has asked me to move out of our 2 bedroom apartment at the end of May so his new wife can move in with him instead.

18,1cp4wtq,AITA for playing ‚Äúbad‚Äù music during a car trip.,"A few days ago my family went on a road trip up to see the grandparents, it‚Äôs a 3 hour drive.

When we were kids my parents made a rule that either me or my sister gets to pick the music going there, or heading home.

Yesterday on the way home was my turn for the music, I was playing what I thought would be good car music but unfortunately my sister thought otherwise as she kept on asking me to change songs. I refused every time and that seemed to piss her off more and more until we got home and she stormed off into her room.

Parents want to stay out of this so I need ur advice.

(I‚Äôm 18 and my sister is 16)

I was playing dua lipa and miley Cyrus so nothing super strange 
All the music was either generic pop like that or stuff like pink Floyd and queen ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-11,"AITA for playing ‚Äúbad‚Äù music during a car trip. A few days ago my family went on a road trip up to see the grandparents, it‚Äôs a 3 hour drive.

19,1cp4f3b,AITA for yelling at my sister for bailing on our trip? ,"I (31F) planned a 21st birthday trip for my sister to go to Amsterdam and Greece. We planned this for months - I sent her an itinerary of the vacation (which was 14 days / 10 days of PTO) ahead of time and she told me she‚Äôll handle the pto situation and to start booking things. So I took care of all of our booking and she planned all of the things we‚Äôd do in the actual cities. I also used up all of my points I‚Äôd been saving for years on this trip and paid for both of our $800 concert tickets to this performer we love. 

We‚Äôre excited and I‚Äôm constantly asking her to start planning the trip but she‚Äôs a procrastinator. Now we‚Äôre leaving in two weeks and she calls me and says her boss won‚Äôt give her pto because they have a major release coming up and the max she can take is 2 days. Also she adds she only has 5 days of pto because she used it on other trips this year so she couldn‚Äôt take the full time anyways. Then she tells me she‚Äôs been seriously slacking off at work and is afraid she‚Äôll get fired if she takes unpaid time off for this trip. 

So I‚Äôm like ok I don‚Äôt want that guilt, and I went in her about how I‚Äôm out a lot of money, this is the second time she‚Äôs done this (once before on a trip to Mexico), and that she should‚Äôve told me this when we‚Äôd originally started planning. She‚Äôs hysterically crying and then my parents say it‚Äôs my fault because she‚Äôs new to working and I should‚Äôve known that she doesn‚Äôt have much pto. 

Honestly I feel pretty rejected and abandoned from my family. AITA for expressing my anger? The true feeling is sadness.
