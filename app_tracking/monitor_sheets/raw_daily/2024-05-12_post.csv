0,1cpyl4j,AITA for calling my dad out on his eating when he was policing mine,"Hello, Reddit. I (29M) live with my parents (both 63). We have all lived together for almost two years, and have had no really issues until yesterday. I am a Type 1 Diabetic, and they have always been a little overprotective since they both work in the medical field; they have seen how bad it can get. In the last 8 months I have been eating well and exercising so my blood sugar has leveled out really well. I do l, however, sometimes curb my sweet tooth, and go a little overboard truthfully. The other night I went to a gas station, and picked up two pastries to eat. I got home, just my dad was up, and immediately that I shouldn't eat that. I said that it was okay because I was having protein so my blood sugar would be fine, but he wouldn't back down. After some back and forth his tone went pretty nasty, and he said something about not taking care of myself was bad. I rebuttled saying that his eating habits concerning sweets recently was really concerning me, and thought we should maybe change the subject to that. He immediately got defensive, and said it was fine because he wasn't diabetic. I took it too far, and I responded saying a ""63 year old man with early stage Parkinson's shouldn't eat an entire cake, half a thing of fudge cookies, and an entire bag of Reese's.""

1,1cpyjz9,AITA - Being drunk and cursing at a friend’s place,"Hello, I am 22 and this just happened not that long ago. I went to a friend’s A graduation party, where I did a lot of drinking games. I am the point where I start talking a lot and sort of don’t know when to be quiet.

After being at friend’s A graduation party, we went to friend B’s graduation party later that night. At this point, I was pretty drunk, as in I am talking a lot and my filter is kind of gone.
Friend B’s family clearly has more money than me, at a certain point at the party, I made a joke that I was too poor to be at a place like this, (aka his house). Friend B’s high school friends who are also rich seemed to find it funny and laugh hard at it. Fast forward to us leaving, to us walking out, Friend B was talking about some painting’s he did at the wall, and I blurted out “I fuck with this one” to make him cheer up but I didn’t realize his mom, (my first time meeting her), was there. The people I went with said I was stupid and in the wrong for me making the joke and cursing in front of her. Am I the ass hole?

TLDR: I got drunk at friend A’s graduation party, had to go to friend B’s graduation party. I proceeded to make a “i’m too poor joke” and curse in front of his mom one time without realizing she was there.",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA - Being drunk and cursing at a friend’s place Hello, I am 22 and this just happened not that long ago.

2,1cpyhyo,AITA For telling my girlfriend to leave me the **** alone?,"My gf (24) and I (M25) have been dating for 2 years a week prior to this post. She and I spend a lot of time together and know each other very well. I have had some relationships issues in the past so am very forward and communicative because of situations I’ve been in relationships in the past. I am irrationally afraid of clowns. I have to emphasize the irrational part. My dad used to watch scary movies when I was a kid and IT was one of his favorites. This movie has had such an impact on my life that I have been to the hospital for panic attacks because of incidents with clown in which my gf was there for. We went to a haunted house and long story short, I was very affected by the clown portion. Ultimately I say this to say she knows of my fear and the effect it has on me.

We had a pretty big argument over her not working the past month. She brought up a feeling of stagnation and depression and I attributed it to her unemployment as in my experience while working sucks, being productive is a very big driver in motivation and overall mental health. I am a very blunt and forward person and struggle a bit with empathy so looking back on it, I was a bit rude. She took this as me saying she was lazy and nonchalant about her career. Ultimately, I’m not concerned about that. While I do want her to be successful, I more want her to be happy. I assume she felt attacked and instead of communicating this to me and us working it out, she internalized it and has taken to retaliation. After a long night of socializing with our friends, we went back to my apartment. She turned on a movie and we sat together watching it for a while. I drifted asleep and was soon awoken by her in a full clown halloween costume. This was one of the most terrifying and frightening experiences I may have ever had.

Falling asleep with someone I’m completely vulnerable and have a lot of trust for to be awoken by my true worst fear sent me to a full fledged panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, in my own home nonetheless, and was paralyzed by fear. She not only targeted my weakness but continued tormenting me while I hyperventilated and I was soon in tears, curled up on the floor, struggling to breathe. After what felt like years (truthfully 5 minutes), she took off the costume trying to comfort me and bringing me an inhaler but started saying that was how I made her feel after speaking about her not having a job. I really love her, we felt like such a perfect match, but to attack me so personally and without communication of the underlying issue prior, I have truly lost all trust for her. I told her to leave me the f\*\*\* alone and get out of my house. Obviously this went over poorly, but I have never felt so betrayed by someone I loved before. She hasn’t spoken to me for the 2 weeks since despite my efforts and I’m truly exhausted in trying. Am I the asshole?

4,1cpy3lb,AITA for wanting my best friend to break up with his girlfriend?,"I've been struggling for a while questioning these thoughts, so I figured I'd ask them here.



For context, and to keep people's names anonymous, I'll call these people James (my best friend) and Emily (James' girlfriend).



I've been close friends with James for about 6 years now, we've always had fun together. For the past 4 years, he's had Emily as a girlfriend. I thought they were strong and loving together, but for the past year, I've been hearing a different story.



James and Emily have a fun hobby of writing an online comic together. It's something they both enjoy, and I support those activities. Recently, however, Emily has been getting very aggressive to James whenever he doesn't want to write comics together. Emily always says how selfish James is being, that he's ignoring her feelings. But even worse, they've been arguing during a majority of time they do write comics, disagreeing over what should go in it, often with Emily making final decisions. James understandably, has been wanting to write less because of this.



In addition, from what I've seen, Emily's been a little emotionally manipulative, having told James about how I'm a problem, how he shouldn't be talking to me, and that any disagreements should only ever be kept between them, but also calling James a cheater multiple times just for being close friends with me and demanding James pick up the phone to argue with him when he asks to be left alone. She gets angry when he doesn't buy her stuff even though James works a middle-class job at a grocery store and doesn't make much anyway. A lot of her words come off to me as victim blaming.



These issues have been going on for the past year, but most noticeably coming up in the past few months, and I'm unfortunately stuck in the middle of it. It doesn't help that Emily thinks that I'm going to try to steal James from her, her theory is backed up by how for the past few months I've been James' only real support for relationship drama. Hearing his side of the story, rarely do I hear positive things about their relationship, and these issues I hear problems about several times a week. I'm getting close to the point of telling James that he needs to break up with Emily because, as I've seen it, this seems to be turning into a very toxic relationship, and he's getting more hurt than help being in it.



I still don't know if I should say that though, I don't want James to be hurt, and he's the kind of person who has a very hard time losing friends. Even worse, James knows that I at one point, had a crush on him. I told him because I wanted him and Emily to be happy together and it wouldn't help to hold in that information, but now that he does know it I worry that if I tell him to break up with Emily (even if it is for good reasons) that it will come off as me wanting to ""steal him"". I don't, fyi.

8,1cpxm0a,AITA for calling my bf a bad person?,"I’ve always really loved bugs and I strongly believe that bugs are alive, just like people, and that all living beings deserve respect. I would never kill a bug myself, on purpose, of course.

I use to get really mad at my siblings and cousins for killing bugs when I was a kid, but I’ve soon calmed down. I know people do it, but they don’t do it in front of me.

I thought my bf was the good type. When he finds a spider in the house, he takes it outside instead of vacuuming it. We would let it stay, but his roommate gets pissed. Once we were vacationing with our family and moths kept flying in through a small hole in the window. He would cup the moths and put them outside. 

His brother saw this and told him to kill the months. I told his brother to shut up. My bf said he felt no need to kill them, they would put them outside gently. His brother made fun of him and starting saying, “so bug lives matter now?” My bf ignored him but I knew I got a good one. Someone who appreciates living things.


I thought we understood each other. But today, I ran up to him when he didn’t know I was there and I saw him squash a bug, one that was on the road in front of him. He was talking to a friend and stepped on a bug that was under him.

I was walking up to him and immediately gasped. He asked what was wrong because it was clear I was horrified, and I said he killed it. He asked what I was talking about and I said he killed the bug, it was a living creature and he killed it.

He said oh, he didn’t really think much about it. I had no words. I was shocked. Without thinking I said I didn’t know you were a bad person like that, which made him really shocked.

He got pissed off and apologized to his friend. He literally got mad at me and said “you’re acting crazy, it’s just a bug, you just called me a bad person over a bug.” I said it’s a living breathing living sentient feeling thing just like me and my bf. If he doesn’t want to be called a bad person, he shouldn’t do bad things.

It turned into a big fight. AITA here?",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA for calling my bf a bad person? I’ve always really loved bugs and I strongly believe that bugs are alive, just like people, and that all living beings deserve respect. I would never kill a bug myself, on purpose, of course.

I use to get really mad at my siblings and cousins for killing bugs when I was a kid, but I’ve soon calmed down. I know people do it, but they don’t do it in front of me.

I thought my bf was the good type. When he finds a spider in the house, he takes it outside instead of vacuuming it. We would let it stay, but his roommate gets pissed. Once we were vacationing with our family and moths kept flying in through a small hole in the window. He would cup the moths and put them outside. 

His brother saw this and told him to kill the months. I told his brother to shut up. My bf said he felt no need to kill them, they would put them outside gently. His brother made fun of him and starting saying, “so bug lives matter now?” My bf ignored him but I knew I got a good one. Someone who appreciates living things.


I thought we understood each other. But today, I ran up to him when he didn’t know I was there and I saw him squash a bug, one that was on the road in front of him. He was talking to a friend and stepped on a bug that was under him.

9,1cpxklw,AITA for not letting my husband by a $260 shirt for a wedding,"We're going to a good friend's wedding in June and the theme is 'Palm Springs'. It's a small and casual wedding in their backyard. 

We just moved so it would take us 5 hours to drive there so we're going to make a weekend out of it and stay a couple of nights and catch up with old friends. We have a baby so a good friend of ours is really looking forward to seeing him. 

My husband (33) wants to buy himself a new outfit specifically for the wedding, which is fair enough, but he's looking at this $260 luxury shirt. He was also looking at some $200 loafers, and a new pair of trousers. He already has his Panama hat so he'd be saving money there, he says. Are you rolling your eyes yet? 

I (34) can't fathom paying that amount of money for one item of clothing, especially for a wedding that isn't my own and a wedding that is going to be very casual. It doesn't make sense to me. He would be the most well dressed person there, more so than the bride and groom, which I feel could be embarrassing. 

He says that he doesn't have anything in his wardrobe currently that fits the Palm Springs theme and that if he can't buy the shirt then he doesn't want to go anymore and that I should go by myself. This would be quite challenging as our baby is still very young, it is really helpful having him there to help with the driving and simple stuff like keeping the baby occupied whilst I have a shower y'know. 

His logic is that if we can't afford that shirt then why are we able to afford the hotel and the gas to get there? My argument is that I'm sure there are plenty of more affordable shirts on the internet that he would find appropriate, of course there is. It's the all or nothing childish approach that really bothers me. 

For a bit more context, we just bought a new house and now have a bigger mortgage. I'm feeling extra aware of our outgoings and want to be more frugal with our spending over the next few months. I'm the 'bread winner' and he's staying home to look after the baby, which is amazing. We have a joint bank account only, no individual accounts. 

Anyway, this dumb conversation meant he decided to sleep on the coach and I feel like I'm the asshole for controlling his spending habits and telling him what he can and can't buy. 

AITA? 

Edit to add further detail:
Yes we can afford it but I would rather the money would go towards something else we need more right now. We still need to furnish parts of the house so I'd rather he bought a $260 piece of furniture instead. 

Since we moved here about a month ago he has been spending a lot more than usual. For example, this would be the 4th pair of shoes he has bought this month alone and I feel they were all unnecessary purchases. Things are getting a bit out of control. This is making me feel financially unstable and question whether I can support his spending habits.  

We're quite different when it comes to clothes and I guess that's also part of the issue. I'm quite minimalist and only replace things when they're completely worn out, but he only wears things for a short time and then throws them out (thrift shop). So my concern is that it will be money wasted if he doesn't wear it more than once. 

He already has lots of very nice clothes to choose from, he has great taste in fashion. There's definitely something in his wardrobe that would work great but the occasion has sparked the purchase idea. He's a golfer so I feel he could even just wear one of his more flamboyant golf tops and then he'd be just fine, it's a chill wedding. That suggestion didn't go down very well. 

Thank you to those who commented that it's not about the shirt. You're right that he needs some reassurance and we need to have some more open discussions about what we're both comfortable with for spending decisions right now. 

Buy* 🫣 Reddit won't let me edit the title of the post so we'll have to live with it. 

Edit for more context:
1. He golfs three times a week and has lots of new friends. He's very active, runs 5 times a week too. He has lots of outlets and alone time outside of looking after the baby, especially in the evenings when I'm getting the baby to bed he's sat on his laptop doing online shopping. 


2. He insisted on the joint bank account because his logic is that we're married and should share everything. I'd rather have both our own accounts and a joint account for the mortgage and household bills. From all the comments I've read, him and I need to seriously chat about this so it should really be a non-issue. 


3. The baby is 12 months old and still breastfeeding. I wouldn't be comfortable leaving my husband solo with him for a weekend and me being so far away. Maybe with a lot of planning we could do it but we're not there yet, it would be hard on both of them. Plus I'd really miss him both of them. The baby doesn't sleep through the night without waking several times. 


4. I run my own business that is doing well. I choose what my salary is so one of his comments is why don't I pay myself more so he can then afford whatever he likes? It's not so easy to just do that as the business needs to save and have its own financial stability and growth. 


5. He does have a spending addition. He loves online shopping and anticipating things coming in the mail, but then he forgets quickly and moves on to the next purchase. 


6. Budgeting has been really challenging as he just keeps using the credit card even if I say we've met our monthly budget for clothes etc. He doesn't want to be limited. He doesn't understand that eventually there would be no money to pay that credit card off. He then thinks my business is failing, which it isn't, but in his eyes it must be failing if it can't support his lifestyle. 


7. My outfit cost $70 and is a dress. I'm going to wear a pair of shoes I already own and yeh I'll get a haircut too that'll cost $85. He's also going to get his haircut, $30. 


Thank you so much everyone for your very honest feedback. You are all right, I should not be using language like 'letting' him, it's very controlling and condescending. I regret my use of that kind of language. He should have his own bank account where he can choose what to spend his money on and then this becomes a non-issue. I'll have a chat with him and let everyone know what we decide. I really love him and want him to feel great and look great, but not if it means we're in debt.

10,1cpxj0d,AITA for not wanting my sister at my birthday celebration?,"I (F) have a birthday coming up. While I don’t want to share my age online, I will say that I am a teenager and it is not any milestone type of birthday. I have an older sister, who we’ll call Lacy (F). Lacy and I have always fought a lot. We’ve never really gotten along, even as we’ve gotten older. 

In February, Lacy went to go live with our dad instead of our mom, so I rarely see her much anymore, considering we go to different schools. Around a week later in february, Lacy asked me what I was planning to do for my birthday. I said I wasn’t sure yet, but probably wanted to hang out with some friends & my boyfriend. I then talked about people I wanted to be there, and she asked if she was invited. I tried to be polite, and say that I just wanted to do something with my friends, and that we were still planning to do a family thing around then too. She got upset at this, and said “Well am I not your friend?” We fought, with her saying that I should invite her just because she is my sister, and that if it were reversed, she would invite me. She wasn’t taking no for an answer, so we dropped the conversation for that time. 

We had the same exact argument around 3 or 4 more times, including when we had the same argument last night. She wasn’t taking my reason for the truth, and said that I “must hate her and that’s why I don’t want her there.” 

I thought I would post on here, to see if I am really just being an asshole about the whole thing and just invite her. For context, only 1 person that would be at the party she knows, because when she went to my school, she didn’t make that many friends.

11,1cpxcc8,WIBTA For not telling a friend about a party he wasn't invited to,"Friend A (Host) and Friend B (Uninvited) are in my circle of friends. The two have gone a lot longer back than our current circle of friends has existed, the two being pretty close.

Recently, Friend A got a house with a pool that our circle has been keen on seeing for a housewarming pool party.

Friend A did end up doing a small get together, put together last minute that morning, with less than half our circle of friends as a test run. He also asked us not to tell the rest of the group until he's ready.

It is an understatement to say we were surprised Friend B was not invited. While we knew Friend B already had plans for that day anyway, with the two having been tightly knit- it didn't seem right that they would be kept in the dark.

A week has gone by, but today Friend B brought up in a conversation just between us ""If Friend A plans a pool party, you better invite us""

I kept my promise with Friend A and didn't say anything, just saying ""Alright. I think he's trying to plan something for all of us"" and that was it.

Now that I've had time to think about it, I'm currently feeling AITA for not spilling the tea. While I respect Friend A's decision to keep it under wraps, I feel insincere when Friend B has directly asked about it. I'm worried it'll hurt in the long run- especially if he heard about it but didn't hear it was a test run or that we knew he had plans for the same day.

Until that day I always used to be happy it was my birthday, since then always it end up being a day when someone else comes and there's more important things to do and we end up celebrating with family I barely speak to. Last year my mother shouted at me, for not having a plan for my birthday. I really hate the day I was born. 

This year like I said it's Mother's day and my birthday at the same time. So I decided I wasn't going to celebrate my birthday. My father is abusive financially towards me and my mom, my mom used to work and pay everything but she quit during the pandemic and hadn't be able to find a new job. My father wanted to do a Mother's day dinner with aunt and cousin this Saturday, and I asked how was he going to do it, since he didn't clean the house and didn't cook, he shouted a little and said then we will not be doing anything. My mother said she wanted to celebrate her day just she and me. I really thought that was the end of it. 

But this Friday my mom told me, my father has invited my cousin and aunt (by proxy, her husband, son and other cousin ) to ""celebrate my Birthday"". I was reallyad because that means a lot of fighting, I didn't want to stay in my house that day. My mom said there was no other way. I was really mad and preferred not ot speak to my father, today he said I had an horrible attitude, and I should change, and paid for the things he gave me when he found that the vacuum he bought almost a year ago was broken, I said i could pay him that and if it was so much trouble I could get out of the house. He didn't allow me to leave when I tried. I told my mom, who is organizing a dinner this Saturday for the community we live in, what happened and get yelled some more and she said I should leave the house. 

My father was supposed to clean the house, and it is even worse that at the beginning of the day, and he only washed the dishes and left to go to the party. And since my mom is also there, I'm the only one left to clean everything. 

I guess my attitude was indeed bad, and I really don't have the money to live elsewhere, I don't have a job since I study full time. Maybe I'm just ungrateful

16,1cpwvuo,AITA for not wanting to share a personal sized pizza with three other people?,"This is my first time posting anything and I’m on mobile so unsure if I’m doing it right. 

I (F35) am gluten free (celiac) and have been for over half my life. My husband (M35) is not. We had two friends stopping by for dinner who are also not gluten free. 

My husband suggested we get pizza and mentioned to me that one of the friends only eats chicken as far as meat goes, so I should factor that into my order. I said, “well that doesn’t really affect me since I wasn’t planning on sharing, but noted, I’ll see what options they have for her.” Husband freaks out at me, because apparently I’m being ungrateful? He asked why I didn’t want to share and I said, “the gluten free pizzas are basically personal pizzas, and I regularly eat the whole thing when we order it. I’m supposed to offer half of mine to other people when I can’t eat what they are eating?” He wouldn’t hear me at all and said if I didn’t want to share I could pay for my own pizza myself. I don’t really care about paying for it myself but the idea that I’m supposed to give away some of my dinner when I can’t eat what other people are eating is stupid to me. It’s not like we are ordering every pizza gluten free. It just doesn’t make sense! They eat my food, I can’t eat their food. I can understand the principle of offering but… one gf pizza from this place is only enough for one person. If we were getting multiple gf ones I’d absolutely share, but they got two larges for the three of them. He continued to go on about how ungrateful I was being and said some other stupid stuff before I told him to fuck off and went upstairs. 

I ended up just going upstairs and not eating or seeing them at all. I came downstairs later and he had ordered me a gluten free pizza and said from across the room, “are you ready for your Grateful Free pizza? You need to have a better attitude about things that aren’t yours in the future.” I didn’t reply or eat the pizza (I was already heating something else up and hadn’t noticed the pizza, but I will eat it later because I’m pregnant and starving all the time.)

Just for the record, this has happened before several years ago where we ordered pizza and only one gf for me, and it arrived and everyone thought mine looked super good (I don’t order regular pepperoni/tomato sauce) so the four other people (husband included) took over half my pizza before I even got a bite. It pissed me off because I then didn’t have enough food and they still had plenty PLUS pieces of mine. So perhaps this is a sore subject for me. Again, I’m also pregnant, though this would still bother me if I weren’t.

20,1cpvoko,"AITA for selling a shirt my wife got me that I hate (the team on it) to a friend, instead of letting her give it to her brother instead? ","Back in November my wife accompanied me to an appointment I had out of town. While I was at said appointment she went shopping. She got me a shirt and when we got home she showed it to me and while the shirt and design of the shirt is cool, it’s for an NBA team I utterly hate and despised for my whole life.

I told her this (re-reminded really) how much I hate this team and said I won’t ever wear it for that reason. At this point she told me she might give it to her brother for his birthday. I honestly didn’t want this shirt in the house but since she couldn’t take it back I just let it be. Maybe a couple months later, while shuffling through my hung up shirts in my closet it’s right there touching my other clothes! While I have been openly hostile about throwing it away a few times in her presence I didn’t; and to defend my wife, she is not at all into sports* let alone North American sports (she is European raised) so she doesn’t get why I hate it and don’t want it around. It stayed in my closet and every once in a while I would run into it and had to fight myself throwing it in the trash. 

Sometime in early April I decided to sell it, a few fans of that NBA team I knew were interested but the shirt was way too large for them, so it took a little while until I got rid of it and the person was elated about getting it. I got a different shirt, one I love (and “now in retrospect”, would really like for my brother in-law to have instead) and kept the new shirt in my locker at work.  Well I completely forgot about my brother in-laws birthday is tomorrow (being Mid-May) and she texted today (nearly 6 months after the original shirt was bought for me) while I was at work, looking for the shirt. 

OFC she is livid that I got rid of the shirt and I even show her the other shirt but she is frankly so blindingly pissed at me so she just wants me to take she shirt back and would rather show up ‘empty handed’ (her words). 

I’m upset because yes, she brought the shirt for me but I replaced it, since she clearly didn’t take into account or consideration it’s of a basketball team I not only never have worn or mentioned positively but openly I hate, let alone I honestly love the other shirt because it’s a Mohammad Ali shirt. Yet she is mad because she mad because she was set on giving him that particular shirt after finding that I wanted nothing to do with it. We even got into it over the definition of the word “GIFT”

We had been together for 12 years at that time and we have 2 kids together, 6 & 9 years old. We split custody 50/50 and I also pay child support monthly. He also claimed the children this year on his taxes.

I work from home roughly 70% of the time and my partner works nights, so someone is always here to be home with the kids after school when I have them. That's where the issues started. My ex feels that I should take the children for him every single school day on his weeks, from 2-6:30 when he gets off work, for free. His reasoning is that I have a partner here to help me and he doesn't, and that child support is not for childcare expenses. I told him to use the tax money to pay for childcare but apparently that's not good either. I have taken them a few weeks here and there for him, while reminding him he needs to find an alternative. 

Summer is coming and it's been a constant fight with him. He is pushing me to agree to take them every day on his weeks this summer despite my warning that I cannot from 9:30 - 6:30.

He doesn't seem to understand  that I am still working despite it being from home and I cannot just stop work to take care of them, stop fights, etc. And then he throws out ""well your boyfriend can"" or something snarky like that.
