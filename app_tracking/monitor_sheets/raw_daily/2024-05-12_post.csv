0,1cpyl4j,AITA for calling my dad out on his eating when he was policing mine,"Hello, Reddit. I (29M) live with my parents (both 63). We have all lived together for almost two years, and have had no really issues until yesterday. I am a Type 1 Diabetic, and they have always been a little overprotective since they both work in the medical field; they have seen how bad it can get. In the last 8 months I have been eating well and exercising so my blood sugar has leveled out really well. I do l, however, sometimes curb my sweet tooth, and go a little overboard truthfully. The other night I went to a gas station, and picked up two pastries to eat. I got home, just my dad was up, and immediately that I shouldn't eat that. I said that it was okay because I was having protein so my blood sugar would be fine, but he wouldn't back down. After some back and forth his tone went pretty nasty, and he said something about not taking care of myself was bad. I rebuttled saying that his eating habits concerning sweets recently was really concerning me, and thought we should maybe change the subject to that. He immediately got defensive, and said it was fine because he wasn't diabetic. I took it too far, and I responded saying a ""63 year old man with early stage Parkinson's shouldn't eat an entire cake, half a thing of fudge cookies, and an entire bag of Reese's.""

1,1cpyjz9,AITA - Being drunk and cursing at a friend’s place,"Hello, I am 22 and this just happened not that long ago. I went to a friend’s A graduation party, where I did a lot of drinking games. I am the point where I start talking a lot and sort of don’t know when to be quiet.

After being at friend’s A graduation party, we went to friend B’s graduation party later that night. At this point, I was pretty drunk, as in I am talking a lot and my filter is kind of gone.
Friend B’s family clearly has more money than me, at a certain point at the party, I made a joke that I was too poor to be at a place like this, (aka his house). Friend B’s high school friends who are also rich seemed to find it funny and laugh hard at it. Fast forward to us leaving, to us walking out, Friend B was talking about some painting’s he did at the wall, and I blurted out “I fuck with this one” to make him cheer up but I didn’t realize his mom, (my first time meeting her), was there. The people I went with said I was stupid and in the wrong for me making the joke and cursing in front of her. Am I the ass hole?

TLDR: I got drunk at friend A’s graduation party, had to go to friend B’s graduation party. I proceeded to make a “i’m too poor joke” and curse in front of his mom one time without realizing she was there.",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA - Being drunk and cursing at a friend’s place Hello, I am 22 and this just happened not that long ago.

2,1cpyhyo,AITA For telling my girlfriend to leave me the **** alone?,"My gf (24) and I (M25) have been dating for 2 years a week prior to this post. She and I spend a lot of time together and know each other very well. I have had some relationships issues in the past so am very forward and communicative because of situations I’ve been in relationships in the past. I am irrationally afraid of clowns. I have to emphasize the irrational part. My dad used to watch scary movies when I was a kid and IT was one of his favorites. This movie has had such an impact on my life that I have been to the hospital for panic attacks because of incidents with clown in which my gf was there for. We went to a haunted house and long story short, I was very affected by the clown portion. Ultimately I say this to say she knows of my fear and the effect it has on me.

We had a pretty big argument over her not working the past month. She brought up a feeling of stagnation and depression and I attributed it to her unemployment as in my experience while working sucks, being productive is a very big driver in motivation and overall mental health. I am a very blunt and forward person and struggle a bit with empathy so looking back on it, I was a bit rude. She took this as me saying she was lazy and nonchalant about her career. Ultimately, I’m not concerned about that. While I do want her to be successful, I more want her to be happy. I assume she felt attacked and instead of communicating this to me and us working it out, she internalized it and has taken to retaliation. After a long night of socializing with our friends, we went back to my apartment. She turned on a movie and we sat together watching it for a while. I drifted asleep and was soon awoken by her in a full clown halloween costume. This was one of the most terrifying and frightening experiences I may have ever had.

Falling asleep with someone I’m completely vulnerable and have a lot of trust for to be awoken by my true worst fear sent me to a full fledged panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, in my own home nonetheless, and was paralyzed by fear. She not only targeted my weakness but continued tormenting me while I hyperventilated and I was soon in tears, curled up on the floor, struggling to breathe. After what felt like years (truthfully 5 minutes), she took off the costume trying to comfort me and bringing me an inhaler but started saying that was how I made her feel after speaking about her not having a job. I really love her, we felt like such a perfect match, but to attack me so personally and without communication of the underlying issue prior, I have truly lost all trust for her. I told her to leave me the f\*\*\* alone and get out of my house. Obviously this went over poorly, but I have never felt so betrayed by someone I loved before. She hasn’t spoken to me for the 2 weeks since despite my efforts and I’m truly exhausted in trying. Am I the asshole?

4,1cpy3lb,AITA for wanting my best friend to break up with his girlfriend?,"I've been struggling for a while questioning these thoughts, so I figured I'd ask them here.



For context, and to keep people's names anonymous, I'll call these people James (my best friend) and Emily (James' girlfriend).



I've been close friends with James for about 6 years now, we've always had fun together. For the past 4 years, he's had Emily as a girlfriend. I thought they were strong and loving together, but for the past year, I've been hearing a different story.



James and Emily have a fun hobby of writing an online comic together. It's something they both enjoy, and I support those activities. Recently, however, Emily has been getting very aggressive to James whenever he doesn't want to write comics together. Emily always says how selfish James is being, that he's ignoring her feelings. But even worse, they've been arguing during a majority of time they do write comics, disagreeing over what should go in it, often with Emily making final decisions. James understandably, has been wanting to write less because of this.



In addition, from what I've seen, Emily's been a little emotionally manipulative, having told James about how I'm a problem, how he shouldn't be talking to me, and that any disagreements should only ever be kept between them, but also calling James a cheater multiple times just for being close friends with me and demanding James pick up the phone to argue with him when he asks to be left alone. She gets angry when he doesn't buy her stuff even though James works a middle-class job at a grocery store and doesn't make much anyway. A lot of her words come off to me as victim blaming.



These issues have been going on for the past year, but most noticeably coming up in the past few months, and I'm unfortunately stuck in the middle of it. It doesn't help that Emily thinks that I'm going to try to steal James from her, her theory is backed up by how for the past few months I've been James' only real support for relationship drama. Hearing his side of the story, rarely do I hear positive things about their relationship, and these issues I hear problems about several times a week. I'm getting close to the point of telling James that he needs to break up with Emily because, as I've seen it, this seems to be turning into a very toxic relationship, and he's getting more hurt than help being in it.



I still don't know if I should say that though, I don't want James to be hurt, and he's the kind of person who has a very hard time losing friends. Even worse, James knows that I at one point, had a crush on him. I told him because I wanted him and Emily to be happy together and it wouldn't help to hold in that information, but now that he does know it I worry that if I tell him to break up with Emily (even if it is for good reasons) that it will come off as me wanting to ""steal him"". I don't, fyi.

8,1cpxm0a,AITA for calling my bf a bad person?,"I’ve always really loved bugs and I strongly believe that bugs are alive, just like people, and that all living beings deserve respect. I would never kill a bug myself, on purpose, of course.

I use to get really mad at my siblings and cousins for killing bugs when I was a kid, but I’ve soon calmed down. I know people do it, but they don’t do it in front of me.

I thought my bf was the good type. When he finds a spider in the house, he takes it outside instead of vacuuming it. We would let it stay, but his roommate gets pissed. Once we were vacationing with our family and moths kept flying in through a small hole in the window. He would cup the moths and put them outside. 

His brother saw this and told him to kill the months. I told his brother to shut up. My bf said he felt no need to kill them, they would put them outside gently. His brother made fun of him and starting saying, “so bug lives matter now?” My bf ignored him but I knew I got a good one. Someone who appreciates living things.


I thought we understood each other. But today, I ran up to him when he didn’t know I was there and I saw him squash a bug, one that was on the road in front of him. He was talking to a friend and stepped on a bug that was under him.

I was walking up to him and immediately gasped. He asked what was wrong because it was clear I was horrified, and I said he killed it. He asked what I was talking about and I said he killed the bug, it was a living creature and he killed it.

He said oh, he didn’t really think much about it. I had no words. I was shocked. Without thinking I said I didn’t know you were a bad person like that, which made him really shocked.

He got pissed off and apologized to his friend. He literally got mad at me and said “you’re acting crazy, it’s just a bug, you just called me a bad person over a bug.” I said it’s a living breathing living sentient feeling thing just like me and my bf. If he doesn’t want to be called a bad person, he shouldn’t do bad things.

It turned into a big fight. AITA here?",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA for calling my bf a bad person? I’ve always really loved bugs and I strongly believe that bugs are alive, just like people, and that all living beings deserve respect. I would never kill a bug myself, on purpose, of course.

I use to get really mad at my siblings and cousins for killing bugs when I was a kid, but I’ve soon calmed down. I know people do it, but they don’t do it in front of me.

I thought my bf was the good type. When he finds a spider in the house, he takes it outside instead of vacuuming it. We would let it stay, but his roommate gets pissed. Once we were vacationing with our family and moths kept flying in through a small hole in the window. He would cup the moths and put them outside. 

His brother saw this and told him to kill the months. I told his brother to shut up. My bf said he felt no need to kill them, they would put them outside gently. His brother made fun of him and starting saying, “so bug lives matter now?” My bf ignored him but I knew I got a good one. Someone who appreciates living things.


I thought we understood each other. But today, I ran up to him when he didn’t know I was there and I saw him squash a bug, one that was on the road in front of him. He was talking to a friend and stepped on a bug that was under him.

9,1cpxklw,AITA for not letting my husband by a $260 shirt for a wedding,"We're going to a good friend's wedding in June and the theme is 'Palm Springs'. It's a small and casual wedding in their backyard. 

We just moved so it would take us 5 hours to drive there so we're going to make a weekend out of it and stay a couple of nights and catch up with old friends. We have a baby so a good friend of ours is really looking forward to seeing him. 

My husband (33) wants to buy himself a new outfit specifically for the wedding, which is fair enough, but he's looking at this $260 luxury shirt. He was also looking at some $200 loafers, and a new pair of trousers. He already has his Panama hat so he'd be saving money there, he says. Are you rolling your eyes yet? 

I (34) can't fathom paying that amount of money for one item of clothing, especially for a wedding that isn't my own and a wedding that is going to be very casual. It doesn't make sense to me. He would be the most well dressed person there, more so than the bride and groom, which I feel could be embarrassing. 

He says that he doesn't have anything in his wardrobe currently that fits the Palm Springs theme and that if he can't buy the shirt then he doesn't want to go anymore and that I should go by myself. This would be quite challenging as our baby is still very young, it is really helpful having him there to help with the driving and simple stuff like keeping the baby occupied whilst I have a shower y'know. 

His logic is that if we can't afford that shirt then why are we able to afford the hotel and the gas to get there? My argument is that I'm sure there are plenty of more affordable shirts on the internet that he would find appropriate, of course there is. It's the all or nothing childish approach that really bothers me. 

For a bit more context, we just bought a new house and now have a bigger mortgage. I'm feeling extra aware of our outgoings and want to be more frugal with our spending over the next few months. I'm the 'bread winner' and he's staying home to look after the baby, which is amazing. We have a joint bank account only, no individual accounts. 

Anyway, this dumb conversation meant he decided to sleep on the coach and I feel like I'm the asshole for controlling his spending habits and telling him what he can and can't buy. 

AITA? 

Edit to add further detail:
Yes we can afford it but I would rather the money would go towards something else we need more right now. We still need to furnish parts of the house so I'd rather he bought a $260 piece of furniture instead. 

Since we moved here about a month ago he has been spending a lot more than usual. For example, this would be the 4th pair of shoes he has bought this month alone and I feel they were all unnecessary purchases. Things are getting a bit out of control. This is making me feel financially unstable and question whether I can support his spending habits.  

We're quite different when it comes to clothes and I guess that's also part of the issue. I'm quite minimalist and only replace things when they're completely worn out, but he only wears things for a short time and then throws them out (thrift shop). So my concern is that it will be money wasted if he doesn't wear it more than once. 

He already has lots of very nice clothes to choose from, he has great taste in fashion. There's definitely something in his wardrobe that would work great but the occasion has sparked the purchase idea. He's a golfer so I feel he could even just wear one of his more flamboyant golf tops and then he'd be just fine, it's a chill wedding. That suggestion didn't go down very well. 

Thank you to those who commented that it's not about the shirt. You're right that he needs some reassurance and we need to have some more open discussions about what we're both comfortable with for spending decisions right now. 

Buy* 🫣 Reddit won't let me edit the title of the post so we'll have to live with it. 

Edit for more context:
1. He golfs three times a week and has lots of new friends. He's very active, runs 5 times a week too. He has lots of outlets and alone time outside of looking after the baby, especially in the evenings when I'm getting the baby to bed he's sat on his laptop doing online shopping. 


2. He insisted on the joint bank account because his logic is that we're married and should share everything. I'd rather have both our own accounts and a joint account for the mortgage and household bills. From all the comments I've read, him and I need to seriously chat about this so it should really be a non-issue. 


3. The baby is 12 months old and still breastfeeding. I wouldn't be comfortable leaving my husband solo with him for a weekend and me being so far away. Maybe with a lot of planning we could do it but we're not there yet, it would be hard on both of them. Plus I'd really miss him both of them. The baby doesn't sleep through the night without waking several times. 


4. I run my own business that is doing well. I choose what my salary is so one of his comments is why don't I pay myself more so he can then afford whatever he likes? It's not so easy to just do that as the business needs to save and have its own financial stability and growth. 


5. He does have a spending addition. He loves online shopping and anticipating things coming in the mail, but then he forgets quickly and moves on to the next purchase. 


6. Budgeting has been really challenging as he just keeps using the credit card even if I say we've met our monthly budget for clothes etc. He doesn't want to be limited. He doesn't understand that eventually there would be no money to pay that credit card off. He then thinks my business is failing, which it isn't, but in his eyes it must be failing if it can't support his lifestyle. 


7. My outfit cost $70 and is a dress. I'm going to wear a pair of shoes I already own and yeh I'll get a haircut too that'll cost $85. He's also going to get his haircut, $30. 


Thank you so much everyone for your very honest feedback. You are all right, I should not be using language like 'letting' him, it's very controlling and condescending. I regret my use of that kind of language. He should have his own bank account where he can choose what to spend his money on and then this becomes a non-issue. I'll have a chat with him and let everyone know what we decide. I really love him and want him to feel great and look great, but not if it means we're in debt.

10,1cpxj0d,AITA for not wanting my sister at my birthday celebration?,"I (F) have a birthday coming up. While I don’t want to share my age online, I will say that I am a teenager and it is not any milestone type of birthday. I have an older sister, who we’ll call Lacy (F). Lacy and I have always fought a lot. We’ve never really gotten along, even as we’ve gotten older. 

In February, Lacy went to go live with our dad instead of our mom, so I rarely see her much anymore, considering we go to different schools. Around a week later in february, Lacy asked me what I was planning to do for my birthday. I said I wasn’t sure yet, but probably wanted to hang out with some friends & my boyfriend. I then talked about people I wanted to be there, and she asked if she was invited. I tried to be polite, and say that I just wanted to do something with my friends, and that we were still planning to do a family thing around then too. She got upset at this, and said “Well am I not your friend?” We fought, with her saying that I should invite her just because she is my sister, and that if it were reversed, she would invite me. She wasn’t taking no for an answer, so we dropped the conversation for that time. 

We had the same exact argument around 3 or 4 more times, including when we had the same argument last night. She wasn’t taking my reason for the truth, and said that I “must hate her and that’s why I don’t want her there.” 

I thought I would post on here, to see if I am really just being an asshole about the whole thing and just invite her. For context, only 1 person that would be at the party she knows, because when she went to my school, she didn’t make that many friends.

11,1cpxcc8,WIBTA For not telling a friend about a party he wasn't invited to,"Friend A (Host) and Friend B (Uninvited) are in my circle of friends. The two have gone a lot longer back than our current circle of friends has existed, the two being pretty close.

Recently, Friend A got a house with a pool that our circle has been keen on seeing for a housewarming pool party.

Friend A did end up doing a small get together, put together last minute that morning, with less than half our circle of friends as a test run. He also asked us not to tell the rest of the group until he's ready.

It is an understatement to say we were surprised Friend B was not invited. While we knew Friend B already had plans for that day anyway, with the two having been tightly knit- it didn't seem right that they would be kept in the dark.

A week has gone by, but today Friend B brought up in a conversation just between us ""If Friend A plans a pool party, you better invite us""

I kept my promise with Friend A and didn't say anything, just saying ""Alright. I think he's trying to plan something for all of us"" and that was it.

Now that I've had time to think about it, I'm currently feeling AITA for not spilling the tea. While I respect Friend A's decision to keep it under wraps, I feel insincere when Friend B has directly asked about it. I'm worried it'll hurt in the long run- especially if he heard about it but didn't hear it was a test run or that we knew he had plans for the same day.

Until that day I always used to be happy it was my birthday, since then always it end up being a day when someone else comes and there's more important things to do and we end up celebrating with family I barely speak to. Last year my mother shouted at me, for not having a plan for my birthday. I really hate the day I was born. 

This year like I said it's Mother's day and my birthday at the same time. So I decided I wasn't going to celebrate my birthday. My father is abusive financially towards me and my mom, my mom used to work and pay everything but she quit during the pandemic and hadn't be able to find a new job. My father wanted to do a Mother's day dinner with aunt and cousin this Saturday, and I asked how was he going to do it, since he didn't clean the house and didn't cook, he shouted a little and said then we will not be doing anything. My mother said she wanted to celebrate her day just she and me. I really thought that was the end of it. 

But this Friday my mom told me, my father has invited my cousin and aunt (by proxy, her husband, son and other cousin ) to ""celebrate my Birthday"". I was reallyad because that means a lot of fighting, I didn't want to stay in my house that day. My mom said there was no other way. I was really mad and preferred not ot speak to my father, today he said I had an horrible attitude, and I should change, and paid for the things he gave me when he found that the vacuum he bought almost a year ago was broken, I said i could pay him that and if it was so much trouble I could get out of the house. He didn't allow me to leave when I tried. I told my mom, who is organizing a dinner this Saturday for the community we live in, what happened and get yelled some more and she said I should leave the house. 

My father was supposed to clean the house, and it is even worse that at the beginning of the day, and he only washed the dishes and left to go to the party. And since my mom is also there, I'm the only one left to clean everything. 

I guess my attitude was indeed bad, and I really don't have the money to live elsewhere, I don't have a job since I study full time. Maybe I'm just ungrateful

16,1cpwvuo,AITA for not wanting to share a personal sized pizza with three other people?,"This is my first time posting anything and I’m on mobile so unsure if I’m doing it right. 

I (F35) am gluten free (celiac) and have been for over half my life. My husband (M35) is not. We had two friends stopping by for dinner who are also not gluten free. 

My husband suggested we get pizza and mentioned to me that one of the friends only eats chicken as far as meat goes, so I should factor that into my order. I said, “well that doesn’t really affect me since I wasn’t planning on sharing, but noted, I’ll see what options they have for her.” Husband freaks out at me, because apparently I’m being ungrateful? He asked why I didn’t want to share and I said, “the gluten free pizzas are basically personal pizzas, and I regularly eat the whole thing when we order it. I’m supposed to offer half of mine to other people when I can’t eat what they are eating?” He wouldn’t hear me at all and said if I didn’t want to share I could pay for my own pizza myself. I don’t really care about paying for it myself but the idea that I’m supposed to give away some of my dinner when I can’t eat what other people are eating is stupid to me. It’s not like we are ordering every pizza gluten free. It just doesn’t make sense! They eat my food, I can’t eat their food. I can understand the principle of offering but… one gf pizza from this place is only enough for one person. If we were getting multiple gf ones I’d absolutely share, but they got two larges for the three of them. He continued to go on about how ungrateful I was being and said some other stupid stuff before I told him to fuck off and went upstairs. 

I ended up just going upstairs and not eating or seeing them at all. I came downstairs later and he had ordered me a gluten free pizza and said from across the room, “are you ready for your Grateful Free pizza? You need to have a better attitude about things that aren’t yours in the future.” I didn’t reply or eat the pizza (I was already heating something else up and hadn’t noticed the pizza, but I will eat it later because I’m pregnant and starving all the time.)

Just for the record, this has happened before several years ago where we ordered pizza and only one gf for me, and it arrived and everyone thought mine looked super good (I don’t order regular pepperoni/tomato sauce) so the four other people (husband included) took over half my pizza before I even got a bite. It pissed me off because I then didn’t have enough food and they still had plenty PLUS pieces of mine. So perhaps this is a sore subject for me. Again, I’m also pregnant, though this would still bother me if I weren’t.

20,1cpvoko,"AITA for selling a shirt my wife got me that I hate (the team on it) to a friend, instead of letting her give it to her brother instead? ","Back in November my wife accompanied me to an appointment I had out of town. While I was at said appointment she went shopping. She got me a shirt and when we got home she showed it to me and while the shirt and design of the shirt is cool, it’s for an NBA team I utterly hate and despised for my whole life.

I told her this (re-reminded really) how much I hate this team and said I won’t ever wear it for that reason. At this point she told me she might give it to her brother for his birthday. I honestly didn’t want this shirt in the house but since she couldn’t take it back I just let it be. Maybe a couple months later, while shuffling through my hung up shirts in my closet it’s right there touching my other clothes! While I have been openly hostile about throwing it away a few times in her presence I didn’t; and to defend my wife, she is not at all into sports* let alone North American sports (she is European raised) so she doesn’t get why I hate it and don’t want it around. It stayed in my closet and every once in a while I would run into it and had to fight myself throwing it in the trash. 

Sometime in early April I decided to sell it, a few fans of that NBA team I knew were interested but the shirt was way too large for them, so it took a little while until I got rid of it and the person was elated about getting it. I got a different shirt, one I love (and “now in retrospect”, would really like for my brother in-law to have instead) and kept the new shirt in my locker at work.  Well I completely forgot about my brother in-laws birthday is tomorrow (being Mid-May) and she texted today (nearly 6 months after the original shirt was bought for me) while I was at work, looking for the shirt. 

OFC she is livid that I got rid of the shirt and I even show her the other shirt but she is frankly so blindingly pissed at me so she just wants me to take she shirt back and would rather show up ‘empty handed’ (her words). 

I’m upset because yes, she brought the shirt for me but I replaced it, since she clearly didn’t take into account or consideration it’s of a basketball team I not only never have worn or mentioned positively but openly I hate, let alone I honestly love the other shirt because it’s a Mohammad Ali shirt. Yet she is mad because she mad because she was set on giving him that particular shirt after finding that I wanted nothing to do with it. We even got into it over the definition of the word “GIFT”

We had been together for 12 years at that time and we have 2 kids together, 6 & 9 years old. We split custody 50/50 and I also pay child support monthly. He also claimed the children this year on his taxes.

I work from home roughly 70% of the time and my partner works nights, so someone is always here to be home with the kids after school when I have them. That's where the issues started. My ex feels that I should take the children for him every single school day on his weeks, from 2-6:30 when he gets off work, for free. His reasoning is that I have a partner here to help me and he doesn't, and that child support is not for childcare expenses. I told him to use the tax money to pay for childcare but apparently that's not good either. I have taken them a few weeks here and there for him, while reminding him he needs to find an alternative. 

Summer is coming and it's been a constant fight with him. He is pushing me to agree to take them every day on his weeks this summer despite my warning that I cannot from 9:30 - 6:30.

He doesn't seem to understand  that I am still working despite it being from home and I cannot just stop work to take care of them, stop fights, etc. And then he throws out ""well your boyfriend can"" or something snarky like that.

24,1cqllwn,AITA for Not Putting in Enough Effort to Be Happy on Mother's Day?,"AITA For Hating Mothers Day and Not Putting in More of an Effort?

I (32F) am not married. I have no kids. No one considers me a mother. However. I have raised kids as my own and filled in the parent role for many children. I've always been the “mom friend”. And have had many people call me mom over the years, but they always move on in life and no longer need their “substitute mom” after a few years, while I never forget my kids. 

One teenager I worked with, almost 7years ago, declared I was her mother and I didn't have a say. She started making some new friends shortly after her 21st birthday. My daughter has been slowly cutting me out of her life, and won't call me mom anymore. I think she's fallen back into bad habbits.

I also raised my roommates kids for a time. My roommates never cleaned, didn't pay bills, and ignored their children for smoking weed and playing CoD. The dad also had a meth problem. I worked full-time graveyard, traing a new puppy, and took care of the kids. If I didn't no one else would. I did everything. I hated how hurt the kids were by the distinct lack of interest from their parents, but I made sure they were clean, fed, healthy, and we had as many good memories as I could. I was young and stuck in a cycle of abuse, but I did what I could to protect those kids. 

Eventually everything came crashing down and my roommates skipped out of townl. I have not been allowed to see my kid since and their parents have blocked me on everything, so I can't even see updates on how my kids are doing.

I hate mothers day. It's just one long, horrible day to remind me that I never have been and see no future of ever being considered a mom, while those I consider my children have been taken from me or left me behind. I miss my kids so much. 

I feel empty. All I can do is cling to my dogs and become one of those obsessive ""Dog Moms"". I just want one day with my kids on the day that mom's are suppose to be with their kids. Something inside of me feels broken.

I am the only one who does anything for my mom for mother's day. I go all out. Gifts, cards, activities, ect. All of this while trying to smile, but I feel dead and just want to cry. My mom is not a good mother. I basically raised myself. My long time friends say it'sweird how she acts like the child and forces me to be the parent. I do not like celebrating a day that says she's a good mom, because she's not. But I still love her so...

My family notices when I get back from the bathroom my eyes are puffy. They say I am ruining the day for my mother and sister by being attention seeking and I need to get over the fact that I am not a mom and have no right to be sad over that. It always turns into a big family fight.

Today is no different. My mom says that she knows I hate mothers day, but that doesn't give me the right to ruin it for her when I came out of the bathroom, faking the puffy eyes from sneezing. I am starting to wonder if they are right.

Last year, before my life turned completely upside down, I bought tickets to the eras tour. My friend bought tickets for the Friday, I bought tickets for the Saturday so the plan is: go to both together, stay in the city where it is at for the two nights. 

However, since my mas aneurysm money has been extremely tight, she had to close down her business and it’s only this month she is getting financial help from the government. Factor in my gambling addiction which resulted in 0 savings, we are struggling. 

I also suffer from a pretty severe anxiety disorder, and at the best of times I struggle to even walk into the town, but since she got sick that’s gotten even worse. 

So, I want to tell my friend to take someone else to the tour on the Friday, and to see if I can sell my tickets on the Saturday. 

The city it’s in, is ridiculously expensive, we’re talking £300 each for the hotel, then factoring in travelling expenses, food and drink, that’s at least £500 for one weekend. That’s a monumental amount of money for us atm. And if I sold my tickets that’s an extra £400 of income for us (face value) I’ve already sold two guitars and a PlayStation in the past two months to just make ends meet. The prospect of spending that much money is also really triggering in my recovery, and I’m finding that very difficult to fight. It would also mean leaving my ma for two nights (I’ve yet to do that, a different family member would stay I assume) but that’s making my already severe anxiety even worse. it's 3.5 hours away on public transport so i couldnt get home fast in an emergency.

Let me be clear that I LOVE my MIL and I was very grateful for her offer. I sent her a link to a dress that I liked and she agreed to order it and have it shipped to me. 

The dress came the other day and it's NOT the one I asked for. It's nice, but its not what I wanted. Its a completely different cut and color from what I asked her to get. Even though it's a nice dress I hated the way it looked on me, so I just wore the dress I was originally planning to wear. It didn't perfectly fit the dress code but I figured it was close enough. Apparently not because the moment my MIL saw me she was asking why I wore it instead of the dress she bought me. She was very upset at me for not wearing the other dress considering she paid for it (which I understand but it still wasn't what I asked for).

When I told her it was the wrong dress she said that she ordered a different one on purpose because she thought it would ""fit me better"". Which it didn't because it looked awful on me. She also said the one I sent her was a bit pricey, but she's not exactly living paycheck to paycheck, she has the money for it. She let it go after a while but I'm starting to feel bad for it.

To the point, i wasn’t in school for mutiple reasons (mental health, surgery etc.) and have of course missed school work/tests.

Last week was my first day back and she told us that next Monday we’re going to take the test again for the people who weren’t there, i walked up to her (everyone was working and talking ‘cause of a group project) and asked her about the test. It turns out the test was on one of may doctors appointments and I won’t be going to school that day (possibly the next day either) after telling me that the test is easy if I studied (she put the materials up but wrote like im supposed to understand all that expert-shit) and started to say that i need to reschedule the appointment because “it was made after I told you the date of the test” (it was scheduled for nearly a month) i told her I couldn’t and wouldn’t do that and she just went on and on about how I can’t schedule appointments on test days?

31,1cql5it,AITA for refusing to give someone an item out of my shopping cart? ,"My wife and I were shopping for some plants for our back yard. We picked out a tree and put it in our cart along with our other items. About ten minutes later, a woman walked up to me and said that she had just purchased that tree (the one in my cart). She said she wanted that specific one. To be clear, there were two trees left so she had other options. I asked her why she didn't take it with her when she decided that she wanted it. She said she removed the tag, paid for it and intended on coming back to the garden section to pick it up. To be clear, it was not off to the side nor was there any indication that it was reserved in any way. I told her that similarly, my wife and I had picked this one out and I pointed out that there's another tree; she can just go grab that one. She said 'seriously?'. I said 'I could say the same thing, 'seriously' you're asking another customer to give you an item out of their cart?'. AITA? 

Additional info edit: Store was Walmart. Tree was a Japanese Maple about 3-4 feet tall, probably 15 pounds.
Tree was missing the tag.
She did not show me the receipt nor did I think to ask for it.
Yes there was an open register in the garden section about 40 feet away.
This is my first AITA. I hope I'm not breaking the rules but I think it's important to share my reaction when she approached me, which was 'I can't believe she's asking me to hand her something that my wife and just picked out together and is in my cart'.

I will call her Jane for the sake of anonymity. My dad's birthday falls in the 12th of May every year, but mothers day changes depending on the year.

So today is mothers day. My parents are divorced, and our custody schedule goes as followed. We spend 2 days at one parents place, then 2 days at the next, and then 3 days, which is accounting for the weekends. 

This year my dad's birthday falls on Mother's Day. They agreed amongst themselves that he would take us 12 to 5, then give us back. We went to a buffet, and then back to our dads place.

As it turned out, we spent a little longer at our dads then expected. We were there until 7. I called my mom, and asked if we could just stay the night there. She asked why and I said that I wanted to spend his birthday with him.

We have school tommorow, so the plan would have been to send Jane to her place, and she would drop of my school bag to give to me for school tommorow. She got very upset at that.

We ended up going back to her place anyways, but now she does not want to talk to me. It's been like half an hour, and she has not come to see or talk to me. I am in my room, and worried that I may have ruined my relationship with my mom.

33,1cqkyz1,AITA for calling my school principal immature? ,"I (17F) go to a private school. It isn’t one of the snobby types though, matter of fact it isn’t super high tech or super large at all. This school has a principal I’ll just call Mr. T, now Mr. T seems to take a very hands on approach to his very less hands on school. He pokes his head into classrooms and does nothing but look around before going away like he has nothing else to do. I’ve always found this annoying and distracting but it’s his school so who am I to say anything.
I’m entering my last year of school and I’m already very ahead in terms of credits so it’s very likely I’ll be sitting around most of my senior year. Something I like to do is have my phone playing a podcast of some sort while I work and sometimes depending on the teacher I’m with I’ll have a movie on in the background. I still turn in my work and I’m still doing my work so I don’t find it an issue. 

However Mr. T seems to have a serious issue with it. He has called me to his office a couple times and threatened to take my phone and call my parents. My parents don’t care about me using my phone as long as I get my work done so when he’s called them they’ve told him the same thing, “If she’s getting her work done, what does it matter?” 

Recently he’s been very passive aggressive with me and I can tell. He’s treating me with less care than the other students and is curt with me often. Obviously he’s sulking about the fact he can’t force me to follow a rule that doesn’t affect me. Today he said in an offhanded way, “If you followed all the rules I’d treat you better,” so I said, “Mr T, you have a school to run, there are a million other things you could be worrying about yet you chose to focus on my phone and are upset you can’t do anything about it, you’re being immature,” 

He called my parents and they think I went too far. Am I the asshole? 

Edit #1: Just to provide some insight, the school is completely a “do it yourself” type of deal. We do our work by ourselves and at our own pace. Theres no due dates for things and there’s no obligation to turn stuff in at certain speed. Everyone in the room is working on a different subject but there’s a teacher in the room to help us if we need it.

His mother lives with us. Every year for mother's day, he takes the whole family(me, his mom, our kid(6yrs) and himself) out to eat. Sometimes mother's day falls at the same time as a local art festival, so we all go to that together as well and overall, it's generally a good time. I just hate having to share the ""gift"" of the meal with her. It wouldn't be so bad if he would do something else in addition to it.

I don't think I'm tah or would be for telling him so, he's told me before that he can't fix things if I don't tell him, but it wouldn't be the first time he has reacted negatively to me saying something had me feeling some type of way. I think it's normal to want to have something special on a day that is meant to be special, not have to share it with someone else.

I didn’t think it was a big deal. She doesn’t come over to my house regularly because I can drive and I have a car and she doesn’t, so it’s usually me at her house. Earlier this year, she didn’t have a ride home and I was helping her and her mom out by dropping her at home after school. When I get to her house, she sometimes offers me something to eat (cuz I usually go home and eat something before my class at a different school, and when I go to her house, I don’t have time to stop at my house before I leave for my second school). This was happening quite regularly, before she started using her bike, so I stopped taking her.

The other day, I was at her house and eating and her dad came home and saw me, and he didn’t say anything to my face, but after I left, my friend told me that he was mad at her for giving me food, and he joked that he was going to make me start paying to eat at their house, which is funny to me, but it was just a joke. I asked her why he doesn’t want me eating there and she told me it was because food is getting expensive and it’s like he “has another mouth to feed.” 😭 Be so fr, I’m not even over that often and when I am, I’m dropping my friend home, free of charge. Now to be honest, we’re not poor. We live in a nice neighborhood, in the middle of the suburbs, but the part that tripped me out so much, was that “food was expensive” yet they shop at Albertsons, which in my opinion, has lesser quantities, higher prices and the same quality as Walmart. And, although it was not my proudest moment, I told her that “If food is so expensive, then why do y’all shop at Albertsons?” And her dad also does some other “bougie” stuff that really confused me, if you’re trying to “save money”. I just want to know if I overstepped my boundaries, because I thought me and her were chill, but it’s obvious that her dad doesn’t see it the same way. But I personally don’t understand her and family’s spending habits when they claim, they’re trying to save money.

He spends about half the week at mine with me and my son (10) who is not his biological son and has stated that he should not and is not willing to support me in maintaining the house (hoovering, mopping, putting things away, general tidying things) while he is with us as it is not his house and he helps entertain my son. He cleans up after himself well but to me, we all contribute to the general mess and it shouldn’t just be down to me? 

A big argument stemmed from me saying several times things need doing and I was laughed at and dismissed all week being called lazy (which he said is a joke and I should take it as much) followed by him asking me today what was wrong when I huffed doing the hoovering and having 373 things to do before work while he sat there on the sofa watching me and eruptions.

He spends about half the week at mine with me and my son (10) who is not his biological son and has stated that he should not and is not willing to support me in maintaining the house (hoovering, mopping, putting things away, general tidying things) while he is with us as it is not his house and he helps entertain my son. He cleans up after himself well but to me, we all contribute to the general mess and it shouldn’t just be down to me? 

A big argument stemmed from me saying several times things need doing and I was laughed at and dismissed all week being called lazy (which he said is a joke and I should take it as much) followed by him asking me today what was wrong when I huffed doing the hoovering and having 373 things to do before work while he sat there on the sofa watching me and eruptions.

40,1cqk6s3,WIBTA for telling my brother he isn't allowed to have company in my home?,"Context: My brother ""John"" (30s M) is staying with me for two weeks as he's currently homeless. He ghosted his job a while ago and was just evicted from his apartment for nonpayment. I agreed to let him stay with me, but only temporarily as I don't own my home. His girlfriend ""Jane"" (25 f) is staying with her friend right now as she is also homeless (she was staying with him at his place but wasn't on the lease.)

Neither have attempted to find work/housing, and it's put a huge burden on my family (hers is not in the picture). We buy them food, drive them around every day, and John just games all day in the bedroom I gave up to accommodate him. It's nearly doubled my electric bill. He has no money to cover that bill, rent or groceries, so our agreement is that he can stay with me for two weeks as long as he takes care of my dog when I work and keeps the place clean.

I've had a camera in my place for a while. I've been checking the alerts to make sure he's taking the dog out, and there were a couple days where he only took her two or three times. She peed on my carpet those days, and he didn't clean either mess.

I invited Jane over twice for dinner last week but said no to having company while I'm gone. The two weeks he has here are all my lease allows, and I don't want to get into trouble if my landlord notices people coming and going while I'm not home. John said fine but was clearly irritated by it.

Today, I got an alert and checked the camera - Jane was at my apartment while I was at work.

I got home and they were heading out the door together as soon as I walked in. They said hi, but they were avoiding looking at me and left quickly. She was only there for about an hour, but it made me angry that she'd been there at all without me there, especially after John and I agreed no company.

Would I be the asshole if I said I wasn't comfortable with her being here while I'm gone, and say she isn't welcome back at all since John hasn't really kept his end of our agreement?

TL;DR: My brother is staying with me temporarily. We agreed that he has to take care of my dog while I'm at work, and that he doesn't invite people over when I'm gone. He invited his gf over while I was at work anyway. He isn't taking my dog out consistently and she has peed on my carpet while I was away.

41,1cqjull,AITA for making a point to say that it bothers me my mom never remembers my coffee order when I know hers?,"My mom and I both love coffee. She’s the one that introduced me to it when I was a teen and it’s been one thing we bond over. She takes her coffee in a very specific way depending on which place we go to. Because we get it often (most Saturdays we’ll meet up), I know her order by heart. Unlike her, I have the same order at each place and it’s pretty standard: ice coffee with milk and a little sugar.

Except, my mom can’t remember. If I’m out and grabbing a coffee before heading to her place, I’ll text to ask her if she wants one or I’ll just buy it knowing she’ll appreciate it. She claims she can’t be bothered to remember mine. So, she’ll often show up to my place with just a coffee for herself. She isn’t obligated to buy me a coffee but I’ve asked her before to just call me and I’ll give her money plus tell her what I want. She says she will but then she won’t.

Last week, we met up and she had a coffee. I wasn’t even going to say anything but she goes “I don’t know how you like it so I didn’t get it for you”. I said “You know, it hurts me that we get coffee together so often and I always remember yours, but you can’t ever remember mine.” She just shrugged and dramatically said “I guess you’re a better person than me then”. I got annoyed and said, “That’s not what I’m trying to say. It just feels like you don’t make as much of an effort as I do.” She tried to bring up other stuff she does and I said “Look, it’s really not a big deal. I’m not saying it makes you a bad person or that you don’t do anything else for me. Just that it’s a small thing that hurts me. You don’t owe me coffee. But now that this conversation has gone on, it hurts me that you’re brushing off my feelings”. She once again shrugged. I changed the subject and we ended up having a good time.

Keep in mind: this is not a memory issue (like adhd or dementia). She has said she doesn’t want to learn it. 

I was talking to a friend about this and she called me a drama queen and said there was no point having that little exchange with my mom. AITA for mentioning it?

I apologize for any confusion in advance, I had to shorten this post a lot, please feel free to ask questions.



Recently, I (13 male) had a falling out with an ex-friend that turned into a chaotic mess of lies and manipulation. It began when she made hurtful comments about me and my mental health in which she downplayed my trauma. As she grew more comfortable around me, she let her tongue slip, she talked about trans people in a negative way and made rude remarks about my transition.

A little while after that initial situation a mutual friend came to me during our final school period expressing a dislike for the way Ex-Friend was treating her and towards the end of the period-long conversation we decided to talk to another mutual friend and notify them of what was happening via social media. We initially left it at that but about a week later another situation happened in which Ex-Friend called me a ""slave"" in a video game and then had an argument when I refused to exploit bugs to progress. After the argument I was incredibly shaken up and unconsciously reset all of my game progress in a haze. After I had come to my senses, I rushed to tell the two mutual friends that she was one of the leading factors of my game progress resetting back to the beginning, which is a point I still immensely regret leading with as the reset was made by me and she had left halfway through the event out of anger. One friend contacted Ex-Friend for her side. Ex-Friend confronted me at school, leading to a heated argument. The next day, I tried to talk calmly, but an Ex-Friend accused me of using my mental disability as an excuse.

I proceeded to stand my ground and point out the insults she made to me and how she was running away from her problems because she didn't want to have a proper conversation and just wanted to hurl accusations at me. Her response was ""Calling you a slave was a f-ing joke, can you not take one? I would rather run away from my problems, that's just who I am. I can't help the fact I was born this way."" After this, I attempted to calmly restate my side twice, the first attempt ended in her claiming what the comments she made towards me was ""my fault"" and the second attempt garnering no response at all. The next school day came around and I had to call in sick. Returning to school after being sick, I found my friends had turned against me. Ex-Friend spread rumors, eventually leading to people sending me death threats. 

After I came back, Ex-Friend made even more comments, this time about how I owed her 24 dollars for all of the gifts she bought me in the past, even claiming she would go into my classes and harass me all day about her 24 dollars, causing me to be on edge at school.  I refused, citing her mistreatment.

51,1cqiu75,AITA for not ensuring my mom received her Mother’s Day gift on time? ,"For context, we live across a 3 hour time difference (I am 3 hours behind). 

I (24f) had some friends visiting for a week and it was a very busy/hectic the past 10 days for me. This morning I let myself sleep in and woke up around 10am.

At 10:15am I texted my mom “happy Mother’s Day”, sent a cute gif, and let her know her gift was arriving a little late since I didn’t get to the post office due to my hectic week hosting friends. I showered, got ready, and she texted me back saying “we all have time for things that are a priority. But thank you.” (exact quote). This made me feel absolutely horrible for not sending her gift in time. I did buy it in advance and I meant to take it to USPS, but with work and everything else I just didn’t get there in time. At 11:30 am I tried to call her twice and she didn’t answer. Clearly she was super upset with me, and my sister and brother texted me that she was crying. 

I gave her a call a few hours later and she picked up, and we basically just argued about the situation. Apparently she is also upset that my dad got her a fake flower instead of a real flower, and she didn’t like his card. My 2 bothers didn’t get her anything. My sister gave her a beautiful handmade card in the morning which she was pleased with. She told me she is upset that I texted her instead of just calling her first thing in the morning, and that I didn’t prioritize sending her gift in time to make her day special. She said it’s not about the gift itself, and if I didn’t get her a gift she wouldn’t be upset, just she’s upset that she knows I didn’t prioritize it. I told her that she is choosing to be upset instead of enjoying her day. Am I the asshole?

Side note: I am generally very good about sending birthday gifts/cards on time. All my siblings still live at home with my parents, I live across the country (I am the oldest child).

52,1cqirk6,WIBTA for choosing a charity for my senior project that doesn't directly impact my family,"I (17f) am in the midst of choosing a charity for my senior project next year.   
 Some I had in mind was humane society, big brothers/big sisters, RAINN and YWCA. 

My mother is not happy with this, she wants me to do a charity for any disability related organization because of my sister (13f) with high needs down syndrome and autism. She was more than my parents could handle when she started puberty so they had to put her in a group home (but had a great deal of difficulty getting the district to pay for it and had to spend alot of money on lawyers and have to have the same ba ttle every year for funding so i understand their extreme frustration), but she's home for visits every weekend and holiday so it's almost like she never left. 

&#x200B;

She said ""I don't know why you're looking all over the planet for a charity when you have an important cause right here in your own home!"" And thinks our family shouldn't give a lick of money or attention to any other charity until there are no more problems for my sister. 

&#x200B;

But I've had to sacrifice a lot for her and now I think it's totally unfair I can't even have my own charitable interest without making me an AH.

As I start heading to the Bathrooms and tell everyone where I was at. Nothing was wrong so far. I got told to come back to my aunt. I explained that I have to go to the bathroom, or I may empty myself accidentally. She refuses to believe me on a lot of things, such as the fact I may have kidney stones. Maybe she refuses for that because my brother got them when he was little. My ultrasound is the 16th this month. We argued back and forth for a bit.

57,1cqhbfi,AITA for not wanting my mom to stay with me?,"|(32F) come from a culture where families tend to be nosy; e.g. it is normal for elders to interfere in your business, ask intimate questions or provide unsolicited advice. I find this stupid & have responded to my mom’s comments regarding pregnancy multiple times that it‘s a private matter, non of her business, or simply that if she wants a child then she should have it.
My mom and l are not close, I’m not the golden child & we have a very rough relationship: she is my most discussed topic in therapy, but she acts like she was an angel.

Now the main story: I have been married for 5+ years& live with my husband in Europe. 
We started trying for a baby last year & I’m now 7 weeks pregnant. We broke the news to my parents yesterday because of my father's job; he lives in another country & needs to inform his employer soon about his vacation situation. The plan is to meet everybody back in our home country when I am around 6M pregnant, break the news to everyone & travel back home to have the baby.
The issue is I don't want my mom staying with me & „helping"" with the baby. She is very demanding & often comments on the way I dress, my makeup, my cooking, my marriage, the furniture I choose for my home, etc. If she comes, she'll hijack the situation: She'll complain that the bed is too small, the kitchen is tiny, the freezer cannot store too much food & so on. She will rob my husband of the chance to bond with the baby, & she'll be a burden asking him to get her stuff & translate for her. The last major fight that we had was about 2 years ago& after that fight I fell into deep depression, lost 20kg & took a year to recover (therapy). She doesn’t have a great effect on my mental health & I‘m afraid that if she stays with me, I will get a bad case of PPD.

When announcing the pregnancy, she said that she is eager to come stay with us; I didn’t respond. The next day she explicitly mentioned wanting to come & said something like „don't deny me this"" or „don't take that from me"". I responded saying that maybe it would be best to do that around a month or so after the birth. She got defensive, hinted at wanting to attend the birth and said my husband & I are not experienced & would need all the help we could get, so I mentioned the midwives & the support we get from the medical staff. I told her that we would prepare food & freeze it & that it is cold here & that she would need my husband to drive her around to buy her winter clothes, take her to the supermarket & that is not the proper time for that. She kept saying that I am just saying this now, but I would need someone to cook me fresh food & take care of me. At the end she said this is not the time for this conversation.

58,1cqh12w,AITA for not inviting gf to group event,"Lately, my girlfriend hasn’t been going out with me and my friends. She stopped attending events with my friends after feeling unwelcome at a wedding where the bride ignored her. I didn't confirm or deny her suspicions about my friends disliking her, but it's true they prefer my ex. That friend group from the wedding I’ve known them for 20 years. My ex was part of that friend group as well and my ex fit right in. My girlfriend is very introverted and serious. She comes across as standoffish, though she's actually quite sweet. I like to joke and say she has a RBF. She doesn’t smile much and she’s very pretty and comes from money so she’s a bit of a snob. I’ll invite her to a BBQ and she’ll pop up in her “Sundays best” meanwhile everyone looks like they rolled out of bed. 

Our social differences are becoming apparent, but that's not my main concern. Recently, my friends came over we had planned on going an amusement park and then bar. It was 2 couples. I figured she wouldn’t want to go so I didn’t bring it up. Before they left one of my friends got us all some take out. I also figured my gf didn’t want take out so I didn’t put in an order for her. My gf again eats very healthy. When I came back from my plans she was upset saying that I didn’t consider her feelings. But, I did. I’ve asked her to go with me to plenty of events and she’s declined them if my friends were coming. She said she was mad she had to cook lunch while we all had take out and then she also was the one who had to clean up after they left their take out containers on the table and apparently one of my friends was a messy eater and she spent 3hrs trying to figure out how to get stains out the rug. I would’ve cleaned it up once I got home btw I didn’t expect her to clean up after my guests. She said she was going to be home all day so did I expect her to just sit in a dirty house. And that I probably wouldn’t have cleaned it until the day after because I’d be getting home late.


She essentially said she felt like the help. And said it was different if I meet up with them. But,I invited them over. Nobody talked to her, nobody asked her anything yet they left trash for her and then when they all came back nobody even remembered how they left the house and that she had to clean that. In my opinion I feel like she’s complaining about something insignificant but, what do you guys think. Was I wrong for not inviting my gf when she has said no every other time?

59,1cqgt2r,AITA for giving up on my friend’s weight loss journey?,"My (23F) friend (24F) has continually vented to me about her desire to lose weight and her insecurities about her body for at least 6 months. During this time, we had a conversation about how she wished someone would’ve been honest with her about how big she had become so she wouldn’t have got to this point. She also told me that she really wants an accountability partner to help her reach her goals. I’ve always been very active, so I offered to be that for her and suggested that we become workout buddies to encourage her to get back in the gym regularly. She agrees.

For the past couple of months she’s been very finicky about working out together (she’s come with me maybe 6x in two months) and I try to be encouraging without being pushy because I know life gets busy.

Here’s where the issue arises:
There’s been a hand full of times (after we’d agreed to workout together) where she’ll vent to me about how she’s been gaining weight but doesn’t know why because she’s been doing everything to slim down. At first I just told her these things take time and to be patient with herself but these venting sessions continued. The last time she complained to me about this, she said she was ready to give up because no matter how hard she tries, she keeps gaining weight. At this point, I can’t entertain this delusion so I tell her “You can’t give up something you barely started. You haven’t been consistent in the gym and you eat out multiple times a week, so of course you’re not going to lose weight.” This struck a nerve because she accused me of judging her, although imo I was just being honest. 

I told her she can still exercise with me if she wants to but I will no longer remind her about it and I don’t want her to complain to me anymore about her inability to lose weight. She says she feels like I’m giving up on her, and maybe I am because this dynamic has drained me, although I would love to see her accomplish her goals.

60,1cqgjvn,AITA For Suing my Friend Because She Gave My Dog Away,"I (61F) was very ill about a year ago and no one knew what was wrong for a long time. I was falling a lot and unable to get around well. I had moved into a new apartment on the second floor. I have two dogs and at that point was unable to take them out, walk them, etc. Needless to say, their bathroom habits digressed. I kept down puppy pads and cleaned up multiple times a day. 

Fast forward a couple of months, I started passing out. I passed out, fell and broke my foot in multiple places. I was in the hospital and the rehab hospital for about a month. 

In the meantime, A friend had volunteered to watch my dogs. One of the dogs is a lot more work than the other. I've had him since 2017 when I adopted him from the humane society. She had a few cats as well as the dogs and decided that they were all too much, so she gave the dog to a friend to take care of. I did not know this friend. It took me a bit to get to the point I was able to take care of my dogs again. 

At that point, she brought the one dog back and a few weeks later, told me that the friend moved and she didn't know where and didn't want to give my dog back then blocked me. 

I filed a police report and the other day I filed a lawsuit for $10,000 or my dog back. That's the maximum in the low court here. This has fractured my friend group as some still believe I shouldn't have my dog back, regardless that I'm better now than I have been in a few years.

I’ve had irritations with the coach from the beginning but I ignored it because my son  was super excited about playing.

He really has improved and worked hard and last weeks game the coach asked him to sit two quarters. I was really upset so I asked the board if that was normal, and they said no. They stated that the same players shouldn’t be routinely playing full games while the same players are sitting out every game. 

I messaged the manager and let her know my sadness and frustration and she told me I needed to “do the math” and it was obvious that my son was going to have to sit out because they only have 8 players and one never comes.

Usually, we just stay in one country to see our family and go back home after. But this summer as it is my little brothers last summer with us for a while and mine too. My dad and mom want to travel around neighboring countries as a family.

I normally would have no problem with this, except for the fact that I literally cannot stand being in a room with my dad for more than one hour let alone several days with him. This is due to multiple reasons I will not get into on this post but long story short he was not a good dad to me growing up and even now. I also cannot stand being the parent when my parents fight on vacations or in general. This fighting happens constantly hence why I don't want to travel with them on my vacation time.

Even going through the airport, I have to mediate their petty arguments as they can't seem to communicate between themselves or seem to drag me into it. I have tried to tell them several times to work it out between themselves but again they tell me ""I am the parent you will do as I say"" And somehow drag me back into it.

This summer, my family and I plan to visit my grandparents in Europe. They know I work a full-time job while being a full-time student I am quite literally busy every day of the week and have expressed several times for many years all I want to do is to read a book and relax with the fresh air away from drama and responsibilities. All this I can do while visiting my grandparents as they will mediate fights between my parents rather than me or fights between my parents will be nonexistent as my grandparents are present, leaving me with time to relax and enjoy my vacation.

I've asked them if it's OK if I stay behind with my grandparents while they travel, but are forcing me to go regardless saying it is quality family time.

I just returned from college and it’s my birthday in a few days, so I want to celebrate by calling my one very close friend and hang out at the mall. My mother insisted that I also invite this another person who is a close family friend from childhood and because my mom is very good friends with that person’s own mother. I understand she’s close with her mom but I’m not very close to this person even if we know each other from childhood… only my sister is closer to her. Nor has this person ever invited me to her parties ever. I just don’t want to invite her, it’s my birthday so I get to invite who I want isn’t it? I told my mom that no I don’t want to invite that person and she needs to stop being selfish and make my birthday about her own friendship. She lost her mind, and started crying even because I was cruel to her apparently and don’t care about her friendships? Why is my birthday about her friend? She’s worried that if my mom posts my birthday pics on social media, her friend will see it and feel bad. Btw I don’t know if I should add this but I always found her friend to be a toxic mother herself. So it’s no wonder they’re good friends. My mother then said that there’s no party and I should just go to hell, she doesn’t care what I do on my birthday and just started crying and ran off to her room. Like… all because I’m not inviting a person? I just don’t get why I’m being villainized here. My birthday isn’t for her to keep her friendships, she hardly invites that person’s mother on her own bdays or worries about them seeing her posts on social media even though she’s apparently very “close” with her. Why is only my birthday so important for this? She ruined one of my previous bdays as well by destroying my hair, I don’t know if it was on purpose or by mistake, but all I know is that she didn’t really care or take responsibility for it. She was all glammed up and ready herself and did not give a shit that I was crying about my ruined hair on my own birthday, and again cried when I didn’t want to party anymore. Why does my birthday, the day I was born so unimportant to her to the point that if I don’t listen to her demands that she won’t even bother celebrating it? Am I really the asshole here?

I just returned from college and it’s my birthday in a few days, so I want to celebrate by calling my one very close friend and hang out at the mall. My mother insisted that I also invite this another person who is a close family friend from childhood and because my mom is very good friends with that person’s own mother. I understand she’s close with her mom but I’m not very close to this person even if we know each other from childhood… only my sister is closer to her. Nor has this person ever invited me to her parties ever. I just don’t want to invite her, it’s my birthday so I get to invite who I want isn’t it? I told my mom that no I don’t want to invite that person and she needs to stop being selfish and make my birthday about her own friendship. She lost her mind, and started crying even because I was cruel to her apparently and don’t care about her friendships? Why is my birthday about her friend? She’s worried that if my mom posts my birthday pics on social media, her friend will see it and feel bad. Btw I don’t know if I should add this but I always found her friend to be a toxic mother herself. So it’s no wonder they’re good friends. My mother then said that there’s no party and I should just go to hell, she doesn’t care what I do on my birthday and just started crying and ran off to her room. Like… all because I’m not inviting a person? I just don’t get why I’m being villainized here. My birthday isn’t for her to keep her friendships, she hardly invites that person’s mother on her own bdays or worries about them seeing her posts on social media even though she’s apparently very “close” with her. Why is only my birthday so important for this? She ruined one of my previous bdays as well by destroying my hair, I don’t know if it was on purpose or by mistake, but all I know is that she didn’t really care or take responsibility for it. She was all glammed up and ready herself and did not give a shit that I was crying about my ruined hair on my own birthday, and again cried when I didn’t want to party anymore. Why does my birthday, the day I was born so unimportant to her to the point that if I don’t listen to her demands that she won’t even bother celebrating it? Am I really the asshole here?

64,1cqfwb9,AITA for not wanting to get a matching group tattoo?,"My MIL and two SIL’s went on a girls trip this past weekend, but I was unable to make it. While there, they all spontaneously got a matching tattoo (this is my MIL’s first tattoo and both of my SIL’s second tattoos). The day after they got the tattoos, one of my SIL’s called me on their drive home and told me the story about how they ended up with it. They proceeded to tell me that I needed to get the matching tattoo and they all had to be there when I got it. My SIL (who called me) continued to say she told everyone “if anyone’s down to get a tattoo, it’s liv”. I do have a fair amount of tattoos, but that does not mean I want to get a matching one just because I like getting/having tattoos lol. 

Here’s the kicker - the tattoo is a symbol that represents hiking because they often go on hikes together. I’ve never been hiking with them once in the 5 years I’ve been with my husband lol. That is THEIR thing and that’s totally okay! I’m not at all offended they got a group tattoo without me. I’m more offended they’re trying to push it on me when I had no say in the initial plan (regardless of it being spontaneous). It all feels like an afterthought and I’m not cool with that. 

AITA for not wanting to get this tattoo and am I in the right if I approach my SIL about it? 



UPDATE: I spoke to my SIL last night and everything went super well. I actually felt bad telling her lol. She was so sweet about it and was glad I told her. I could tell she just wanted me to feel included and like I was part of it. Thank you to all for the feedback, truly appreciated!

65,1cqftj3,"AITA for (not) helping my ex-girlfriend in a time of need?
","Backstory: Me (39m) and my ex (31f) split a couple of days ago after a year-long relationship. We're co-workers and met at work; both expats in an EU country, we quickly developed an interest in each other and began dating. However, our relationship was tumultuous. She comes from a traumatic background, leading to untreated conditions such as cPTSD, GAD, and anger management issues. On our last day together, following one of our frequent arguments, she left for her place and texted me declaring she wanted no further contact, even at work.

A few days later, I received a message from her on our work chat, saying, ""I need your help like never before; it's an emergency."" I was away from my desk at the time, so I replied later, somewhat distantly, stating that I was busy at the moment but could assist her later or the following day. She responded that she had lost all her money in a scam call and was panicking, unsure of what to do. I reminded her of her previous request for no contact. Following this, she launched into a rage/panic attack, blaming me for her loss, suggesting that had I responded promptly, she might have avoided the scam, and resorting to name-calling.Having helped her through the entire course of the relationship in all of her issues, in which she was always responding ""you've done nothing to help me"" that was a bit outrageous, though. Nevertheless, I agreed to meet her to address the immediate problem, on the condition that we would focus solely on finding a solution and nothing else. I rearranged my schedule, leaving work early, and drove to meet her.

Upon meeting, she began complaining about never having anyone to help her in times of need, which I chose to ignore, and started calmly outlining the available options (such as reporting to the police and the bank). I accompanied her to the police stationjust to have someone familiar next to her. When the officer listened to the description of the story, he went to his office to draft the report, leaving us alone in the waiting room. Instantly she goes into trigger mode, saying ""when I say it's an emergency you should react fast and that's kinda your fault now"" and ""no matter what I have told you now that's different"". Mind here, she didn't acknowledge in any point that I was there trying to help (though with a distant demeanor) nor said that she was sorry for anything she said. My reaction was to remind her that since she thinks that she deserves better people around her, she should have called them for help, with her response being ""I did but no-one answered hence I called you"". Thing got to the roof with her accusing me again that this is kinda also my fault, in which my reaction was to get my jacket and leave.

Wanting him to do this simple thing has nothing to do with tidiness, but more so about feeling like he is being thoughtful to at least return his own dishes which shows a minimal amount of respect. After dinner (we eat in the living room) usually he will take his dishes out to the kitchen, but only his dishes. He never takes mine. This doesn’t bother me really but can also occasionally bother me a bit. 

It has been agreed that taking care of the house is solely my responsibility. He works and is the financial provider. Because of this dynamic,he isn’t responsible for anything to do with taking care of the house (except mowing the lawn and taking out the trash). I don’t mind this at all, and I don’t even mind if he doesn’t always  bring his dishes in. But it’s very frequent that he leaves his dishes on the coffee table/dining room table and it more so feels inconsiderate more than anything.     

AITA for feeling like he should be doing it more since technically it’s my job to take care of household obligations?

I asked him earlier why he doesn’t try to bring his dishes in after having them on the coffee table, I pointed out a few instances as example, and he immediately got angry and then called me a hypocrite since I will sometimes leave dishes on the table. But I am not inconveniencing anyone by doing so. I am the one who will be returning the dishes when the time comes, so I feel it’s not the same.  Since I’m not a clean freak, the dishes themselves are not the bother, it’s feeling like he very rarely does things that could be classified as “ considerate.”   

A lot of this is spectrum brain behavior, and I’m used to it, but sometimes the feelings of not feeling respected gets to me, like today with the dishes. He got very angry at me bringing it up at all, complete amygdala hijack, which I’m also used to, but I want to go to him now and explain why I’m not a hypocrite (unless the consensus here is that I am actually). 

Edit; could you help me explain why my not brining a dish out is not the same as him not bringing the dish out and that it’s not hypocritical? I must emphasize that he is on the spectrum.

68,1cqfibq,AITA for not correcting my mom when she brought up how she’s grateful my non-genetic daughters look like me?,"My wife (40F) and I (38F) have two daughters Evelyn (6F) and Georgia (2F). We used reciprocal IVF to conceive them. This means that my wife’s eggs were combined with donor sperm to create embryos which I later carried to term. Put simply my daughters share my wife’s DNA but I was pregnant with and gave birth to them.

Recently, I have made a point of taking my wife and daughters to visit with my mom (70F) each week. My wife doesn’t like my mom very much because she was very disapproving when we started dating. To my mom’s credit she has become more accepting over the years firstly because she realized she needed to be a part of my life and secondly because she was very excited to have grandchildren even if it was in a unconventional way.

During our last visit my mom started commenting on how my daughters look just like me and how she’s so grateful for that and that even though we’re a gay couple I’m the one carrying on “their family’s legacy”. I thought this was awkward considering they are actually my wife’s genetic children even though I gave birth but that nuance was lost on her. That being said I wasn’t going to start an argument with my mom over something relatively harmless.

In the car on the way home my wife became very angry that I didn’t correct my mom about how our daughters were actually conceived. I said that it didn’t really matter and that I was angry at her for trying to pick a fight with my mom when she’s doing her best to build a good relationship with us.

I considered Ashley to be one of my best friends and my closest friend at dance. However, in our third year of comp dance, this other girl joined our team, who we'll call Charlotte. All of a sudden, Ashley ditched me 24/7 to hang out with Charlotte. One prominent thing they liked to do together was TikToks. Now, my mom was pretty strict so I didnt' have social media until I was like, 15. Anyway, they ALWAYS did TikToks in front of me, knowing that I couldn't participate. 

Now, fast forward to my fourth year of dance. Ashley and Charlotte still ditched me, so I decided I would make some new friends. I met a girl who we'll call Angela.  I became really close with her and that's when Ash started getting jealous. She always begged me to start hanging out with her and Char again, but I always politely refused.

Soon, the comp season was coming to an end and all we had left was our last comp. Two weeks prior to this competition, we got news that Ashley broke her leg trying to an acro trick in a small, confined space (that, mind you, she didn't even NEED TO DO IN OUR ACRO DANCE). She wouldn't be able to dance for the last comp. So we changed up our dances and hoped for the best heading into the last comp. This comp was especially kind and even though Ashley didn't participate in any of the dances, they still ensured to leave extra medals in the baggies. I told Ash that I'd get her jazz, tap, and lyrical medals for her (so, like half of her medals). She was going to come for our annual team dinner, so I gave her the medals then.

Charlotte agreed to collect the remaining medals, including Ashley's hip hop medal. Now, hip hop was Ashley's favourite dance style. She had a few main solo parts in the front before she broke her leg. That's why I was shocked when Charlotte asked me and Angela to take the medal, especially when she knew Ashley valued it so much. We didn't take the medal, so Charlotte said, ""Well, I don't want it"" and threw it on the ground. We all left it, but Angela and I went back after fifteen minutes to retrieve it.

My sister wanted to do something for her and when she asked what I was doing I said nothing because I was told not to, My sister was upset because apparently, the girl was girl code for “Yes” and I was just a guy who didn't understand. She asked me how much money I was willing to put in and implied I would get paid back, I said $25 and when she said she only had $10 in her account my sister wanted me to give her $37, I said no and she got upset and said I was giving her a headache from negotiation, I give her the money and she said she needed $3 to tip the driver but only paid him $1.59, took my phone and apple paid herself with my card (she pointed it at my face last minute for face ID).

72,1cqf2ok,AITA for not covering all of my friends expenses on a trip,"A somewhat mild situation, if uncomfortable, where we managed to avoid escalating but it got me thinking who ITA. The background is we occasionally rent some villa with a group of friends for an extended weekend. One of our friends usually organises it and does most of the housework while there - mostly trouble delegating as he feels he'll do it best, especially cooking. He's always had habitually unstable income which might have worsened recently, so he was wondering if he would come and finally declined. I then had an idea that, as he usually does more than the rest, and we'd drive the same route anyways, I could pick him up with my car and split his accommodation between the rest of us. I also said something like ""you'd eat at home anyways"" meaning he could only cover his food and drinks as we buy groceries and cook instead of dining out. I asked the others and they agreed. 

3 days of fun later we've packed our bags and are getting in the car. I did a weighted average formula in a spreadsheet to calculate the cost for everyone and everything was covered. As my friend had bought some of the groceries he asked if I'd pay him back the money and I said sure, my calculations say you're owed a small amount as you had spent more than the average. That's the point when he visibly got upset, claimed I'd said that he'd pay nothing for the entire trip and demanded I give him everything he's expensed. He also said that he's spent money on gas for shopping and brought some items from home, though honestly, we all did and have every time. I told him that this is not how I've calculated things as the point was to cover his additonal expenses, not give him a freebie where he leaves better off than he came, and it's not even possible now as I had settled the bill with everyone else and wasn't going to give him that money out of my own pocket. I didn't want to get in a fight considering we had 3 hours of driving ahead of us so I shut up and we spent them in awkward silence, minimal smalltalk and a hasty goodbye.

Now to be fair, this all probably would come off biased just because I'm the one telling it. He's not a bad guy and does indeed take care of us every time for which we're very grateful, and no one was against covering for him this once. If he's had the impression the whole time that he's not going to pay even for food then he might have actually brought more stuff, probably didn't take much of the leftovers compared to the ""paying"" friends, etc. So it's really uncomfortable for me as well as it's obviously mostly a miscommunication but at the end of the day, I feel like I got a ""bite the hand that feeds"" instead of even one ""thank you"", and I don't want to sour things so let me know AITA. Thanks.

EDIT:
The message with my proposal reads:
""Come to think about it, we can take you with our car as we'll travel the same route, so no fuel costs, we will also cover overnight stays, so there is only food and drink left, which you will pay for anyway, so think about it 😄""

But it's not about the miscommunication so imagine he never read the last part, the question is would you have expected for the food & drink costs to be covered or not if a friend proposed to cover for you?

It’s about 10:30am and I was still in bed when David knocked on my door a few times to ask if I had any zip ties. At this point I’m still half asleep and asked what he needed them for, he goes on and just says he needs them. I then rubbed my eyes for maybe a good 20-30 seconds and now David has been standing at my door for maybe a minute and before I even get the chance to get up and grab them he leaves and my door gets slammed (not his fault I had a fan in my window that slammed it).

So after my door gets slammed I get up and start looking for the zip ties. I found them and brought them outside to give to him in which I said in a morning voice  “do you still need these, you didn’t give me the chance to grab them” and that’s the line that apparently pissed him off. 

David’s complaint was that I said this passive aggressively and started to yell at me that I don’t know how I’m speaking to others. I said to him that “I wasn’t even trying to come off passive aggressive, I’m just waking up.” In which he responded that what I just  said to him when offering the zip ties was passive aggressive and talked about the whole conversation in my room saying that while I was rubbing my eyes I didn’t say anything, which is true I didn’t, and tried to argue that it’s 10am and I should’ve been well awake  and that I essentially was wasting his time because he stood at my door for a minute and how he was supposed to know if i’ll be laying there for another 10 minutes because he “has shit to do.”

We then go back to the passive aggressive thing about what I said when trying to give him the zip ties. As David’s saying stuff I’m reacting body language wise and he says I’m disrespectful for that and he’s “done” if I’m not gonna respect him. I then said “yeah i’m gonna react to what your saying” and then he tries to continue arguing but I said “No, I’m done” and started walking away where he then followed me continuing to say that I’m disrespectful and that I paint myself In such a nice way, I had let him finish saying what he needed to and then proceed to explain again that wasn’t even trying to come off passive aggressive, I’m still waking up and then he cut me off and I got pissed and said “i just let you finish you keep cutting me off can i fucking speak” after this he didn’t even let me speak he walked away and I just went into my room.

79,1cqeeib,WIBTA if I avoid attending a deaf event?,"For info : I’m an hearing ASL student, our professor wanted us to join deaf events so I started joining them. We were meeting in the same cafe every two week. So far they went surprisingly well, everyone was so welcoming, i improved my signing skills. But last time something I would never expect happen in a million years happened. 
 
I moved out for collage, so I’m in a different city and there I saw an ex classmate of mine (from high school) I was shocked. I don’t know if he is also attends my college. I think I would see him by now if he did so probably no. 

Back to main thing, I used to be a horrible person in high school , I regret so much. Me and my back then friend group targeted a few people and the ex-classmate were one of them. I can’t go into details here, but there were two instances that resulted in us getting suspended. One of those instances was with that friend. I’m so ashamed to even typing this out now but we also used to take away his hearing aids sometimes to “tease him”

I made an excuse and left as soon as I saw him. Maybe I’m overthinking this, maybe he’s already over things happened back then but I wasn't expecting him to be there at all and didn't know what to do. Admittedly, I got scared that he would call me out because there were a few other friends from my ASL class.

Now I’m considering avoiding the next event for obvious reasons, but I wonder would I be acting like an asshole if I avoid the event instead of facing him and apologizing? I’m scared of the possibility of him rejecting my apology and exposing me to other people there. Which makes me feel like a selfish asshole :(

81,1cqe0dh,AITA for having bad work ethic?,"First of all, sorry for any potential errors in my writing, as English is not my first language. A friend from college (F31) and I (M23) are working on a class project together. The thing is, I have quite a bad work ethic and tend to procrastinate a lot, often leaving work until the last few days. It seems my friend is the opposite and gets stressed whenever I'm trying to complete my work in these final days. I'm perfectly aware of how annoying this can be for some people, and I always feel truly sorry. However, this method works for me, and despite trying to be more diligent in the past, it has never worked out.

Now, onto the conflict:

Next week, we have the deadline for one of the projects we are working on together. I had been telling her that I would be doing my work on the weekend before (the current weekend at the time of writing), specifically on Sunday, as I had to work on Saturday. However, this is not the only project I have, and because the one I'm doing with my friend has a later deadline, I thought I could concentrate on the others first. When I thought it was time to switch to my friend's project, I texted her to plan what was left to do. It turns out she thought the deadline is tomorrow and starts texting me angrily about how dare I be so late and that there is no time left, and that we're just going to fail because of me. At this point, I panicked a little bit and asked other people from class if the deadline is indeed tomorrow. I'm still not 100% sure because my teacher won't respond on a Sunday, but it seems my friend is wrong and there is no specific deadline; it's just whenever next week.

So I texted her that it seems she has it wrong and that we should just finish the work instead of fighting. She just replied even angrier saying that she did everything for the last deadline, and it wasn't reflected in the final presentation. It's true that she did a lot more work than me but she also knows I was really busy at work and had a depressive episode at that time. Nonetheless, I felt like shit at the time and tried to reflect that in all the presentations, but I guess it wasn't enough for her.

This all took me by surprise. First, I was kind of angry because she didn't communicate any of this before today. I sent a couple of snarky texts saying I would just finish the work by myself. She didn't like that. I'm really bad at dealing with conflicts so at this point, I spiraled down emotionally, sure I fucked up. The next thing I know, I've sent her 20 texts trying to reason and communicate: my usual horrible way of dealing with conflict.

Obviously, I've already regretted that already. I'm not really worried she will be surprised by the outburst, as she is also very anxious and also knows of my disorders.

I hired a charter to take us & my brother rented an AirBnB for the whole family. No one asked him to, he just did it on his own. He chose a decent place but there were a few issues. It was a no smoking property & almost all of us smoke in some capacity. There were also not enough beds, & he didn't take into account physical limitations of some of us. I have torn cartilage in both knees & my wife had back surgery a few years ago. I ended up on a bunk bed on the 2nd floor and my wife on a very uncomfortable futon.

Furthermore, rather then split the cost of the rental, he decided to divide the daily cost by the number of beds. If you wanted a bed you pay the price even though not all beds are of equal quality. Everyone else sleeps for free. I told him that wasn't fair to everyone and he agreed and made it so everyone else has to pay $30 a night ""for food"" which my Dad was supposedly buying (still waiting on confirmation from Dad), without changing anything else regarding the beds. This was starting to sound like one of his scams. He has done things like this before his whole life. He hasn't been so bad since he had a son, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

On the last day all hell broke loose. My mother, brother, & sister were smoking all over the place. My mother bragged how she would not be caught & when my wife found her butts my mother made an underhanded comment that implied they belonged to a friend my wife brought along the first day.

85,1cqd5nz,WIBTA if I got mad about my bf buying his suit for prom without telling me?,"So for the past few months it has been uncertain whether my year group would be getting a prom as it had not been organised. A few days ago we were told that our school is waiting to receive the contract from the venue for our prom and so obviously me and my bf need to figure out what we are wearing.

Although prom was uncertain me and my bf had spoken about what we would wear if we had a prom, but we had never definitively chosen what we would wear. I had told him that I wanted to buy a dark coloured dress as it suits my skin tone better, and as we both wanted to match in some way it was convenient that dark colours also suit him better, I even sent him examples

Well today he told me that not only had he picked what he is wearing, he had bought it. I asked to see it and he reluctantly showed me part of it as he wanted it to be a surprise. I can't lie from what I saw it is a lovely suit, but it is light blue. It is such an awkward shade to match also, and where the suit is all blue I obviously don't to wear an all blue dress as there would be too much blue.

I'm not the biggest fan of light blue, especially because I'm quite pale and it doesn't suit me well. I have suggested to him that I buy a dress that is a different but complimentary colour but he isn't a fan of that idea. I'm annoyed that he didn't even show it to me before he went and bought it, and especially the fact that he knew that I wanted dark colours and not light.

I know that prom is not all about me and obviously I can't get too mad because I like the suit. I'm just upset that now I don't have much choice on what colour I wear and that all of the options I have are light. I don't want to be as annoyed as I am because I know that all he wanted to do was surprise me but we had literally spoken the night before and agreed upon either dark blue or dark green.

EDIT: just to clarify I never pushed the idea of us matching - he brought it up. I thought the idea was cute so I agreed. The plan was that I buy a dress that matches with one of the watches that he owns and he said that he would wear jeans and a shirt (we are having a sort of informal prom because this is our 2nd (first together though) because I am in sixth form). Obviously I would've been fine with it if he had said that he wanted to wear the suit he has picked before he had bought it because it is nice.

my childhood friend won't shut up about her summer holiday being super fun (skiing for 2 weeks then Hawaii for another 2 weeks then the rest of the summer is in Florida and they're doing Disney etc) and I lost it on her yesterday because it felt like she was bragging about it.

she was saying stuff like ""ugh I wanted to go to Greece!"" and ""oh well it's gonna be sooooo fun!"" and ""oh my god it's gonna be the best summer ever! can't wait to be on holiday and have fun and not work or anything"" and it got to the point I couldn't stand her complaining/kind of bragging? (plus she won't shut up about being able to see Conan Gray, Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift and she knows I love them and wanted to go but couldn't get tickets or afford them).

Anyway I said something like ""good for you but shut up I'm sick if hearing it you know how I'm feeling about summer!"" and she started crying and now apparently I'm the bad guy for it.

my childhood friend won't shut up about her summer holiday being super fun (skiing for 2 weeks then Hawaii for another 2 weeks then the rest of the summer is in Florida and they're doing Disney etc) and I lost it on her yesterday because it felt like she was bragging about it.

she was saying stuff like ""ugh I wanted to go to Greece!"" and ""oh well it's gonna be sooooo fun!"" and ""oh my god it's gonna be the best summer ever! can't wait to be on holiday and have fun and not work or anything"" and it got to the point I couldn't stand her complaining/kind of bragging? (plus she won't shut up about being able to see Conan Gray, Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift and she knows I love them and wanted to go but couldn't get tickets or afford them).

Anyway I said something like ""good for you but shut up I'm sick if hearing it you know how I'm feeling about summer!"" and she started crying and now apparently I'm the bad guy for it.

so AITA?

87,1cqcs8i,AITA for telling my friend that she's the reason her pets die?,"So I, Ellis (F18) have a friend Lyla (F18) who has had many pets over the last few years and most die after about a year. Last fall of 2022 almost immediately after Lyla's previous pet rat died we got domesticated pet rats at the same time.

Lyla got two female rats and I got one female (I know it's bad to keep them alone, I later got a second one.) One of her rats died this winter, it was about 1,5 years old (rat's lifespans are 2,5-3 years) and the second one died last month. Both died from respiratory infections which are very common in rats. I noticed that this was very abnormal because my rats were both healthy and energetic, and I remembered Lyla telling me that the rat she had before ALSO died young. And the rat BEFORE THAT.

So, last week, Lyla came over for a sleepover and to give me her larger cage. We hung out, went to the movie theater, and after we came home, she took out a vape pen and started smoking in my room without asking if she could, with the windows closed. I calmly opened the window and sat back down to draw (or whatever we were doing.) A little after that I asked, with as little judgment as I could muster, if she did that in her room while her rats were alive, and if maybe it was the reason they all got sick so quickly.

She was immediately apprehensive and began to curse me out because ""how dare you accuse me of something like that"" and that ""damn you are a horrible friend for blaming me.""

As a person who doesn't use scented candles or incense sticks in their room strictly because of my rats, I was surprised she didn't connect the dots sooner. 

In this part of the story I will confess that my asshole move was joking that she shouldn't have been sad for weeks after each of their deaths if she was clearly the direct cause. She left my house shortly after that, and I have tried to reach out to her to apologize, but she wouldn't answer any of my calls/texts.

Some mutual friends reached out and told me off for being an awful friend, and I don't see how I was wrong (besides that last comment.) Am I really TA?

I know how to speak Chinese since my parent's English isn't very good, but I don't know how to read or write it. I would like to say I'm pretty fluent, I am able to converse and understand others fine, and most Chinese people I knew outside of my family thought my Chinese was good or at least better than they expected for someone raised in the UK. I do occasionally make grammar or vocab mistakes when I'm talking about something in Chinese, but in a general conversation, others do get the gist of what I'm saying. 

Recently, my mum invited her friend and her daughter from China to stay at our house for a while, and I really don't like them. I speak in Chinese to accommodate them and even translate stuff for them, but whenever I make a mistake, they would double over laughing at me. I initially tried talking to my parents about it, but all they said was that they weren't exactly wrong since I DID make a mistake. I wanted to confront them too, but my parents always stopped me and told me it would be rude and disrespectful to mum's friend, and also how her daughter is 'just a kid'. To clarify, her daughter is 19.

I don't really see my mum's friend that often much since she spends time with my mum, but the daughter tags along with me a lot because we're the similar age. But I can't ever talk to her without her ridiculing me and laughing at my Chinese when the biggest issue is just saying the wrong word or something. She also started 'correcting' me by yelling at me the proper word to say or the perfect pronunciation of a word if I ever slipped up. She laughs at the fact I can't read or write Chinese. And it just kept building up since my parents told me not to say anything, otherwise she 'might cry'. 

I eventually lost it when she yelled at me condescendingly again because I mispronounced a word. I yelled back at her that my Chinese isn't perfect since I'm born and raised in the UK, and it's rude she does this whilst knowing that. She tried responding with something about how she was trying to help me, but I shut it down. Eventually she started crying and ran to her mum, which got me in trouble with my parents. 

To clarify, I don't mind if someone corrects me, but normally it's very non-intrusive in a conversation. With this girl, she stops the conversation to yell at me. My parents and obviously the friend and her daughter are upset, but my brother said she was rude and it was gonna happen sooner or later.

July 21st is our grandma's 80th birthday, she comes from a line of women where none of them lived past the age of 80 so it's a big deal for her and she announced last year that she wanted to go all out with a weekend long celebration.

When my brother announced his wedding date, she was the first one to react with kindness considering he forgot all about her 80th birthday plans when deciding upon the wedding date. They had made several down payments before announcing, so there was no point in asking them to move the wedding a week before or later for grandma. And grandma wouldn't allow it. She ultimately decided to have a relaxing, lowkey Sunday dinner because my brother and his fiancée also want to have a post wedding brunch that day for relatives and the bridal party. 

My mom and I got to talking and we thought it would be super fun if, at midnight, us grandkids could surprise grandma with a cake and have the band play her favorite song so we could share a dance with her. It seemed like a fun way to include such an important milestone into the celebratory weekend since she was giving up her big birthday bash in favor of the wedding. I called my brother immediately to share the idea with him and he loved it, he even came up with the idea to make the cake England themed because mom and I are taking her to England in September as our gift, it's a life long dream of hers to go. 

That is, he loved it until he didn't, meaning until he spoke with his fiancée. He called to say the ""cake deal for gran"" was off and that same night I received a text from his fiancée telling me I should've checked with her first if she would be okay with it and how I was being insensitive, rude and selfish for meddling with her special day. Yes, her special day. Not my brother's special day or their special day, her special day. She really seems like a good person and we get along well despite not being super close, but it seemed logical to me to contact my brother since it's also his wedding and it's his grandma, not hers.

93,1cqbuyu,AITA for telling my mom no?,"My mother and I (female, 28) have had many conflicts in the past since I was a child, as she often acts abusive, controlling and manipulative.

A few years ago, my grandparents passed away, which is why my mother and her brother inherited their house. They wanted someone from the family to move into the first floor apartment. As my fiancé and I were looking for a larger apartment with a garden at the time, we decided to give it a try despite some apprehension.

We have now been living in the apartment for 1.5 years as tenants, have redesigned the garden and occasionally help with things around the house or on the property. 
It has often happened that my mother only likes to see the things that she thinks we don't do enough of. She tends to forget that we redesigned the entire garden in consultation with her and her siblings.

In addition, my parents moved in across the street last summer and the whole situation was exacerbated by the constant presence of my parents, and my mother in particular. 

Due to the ongoing conflicts, we are already looking for other apartments on the side. However, we are also planning our wedding, which is taking up a lot of our time.

Two weeks ago, my mother asked us to help her reinstall the privacy screen (a wooden gate that has been there for at least 20 years) between our garden and the two parking spaces belonging to our property. This is always removed during the winter as my parents keep their motorhome there for the winter. We spent a whole Sunday helping with this. 

The motorhome is currently parked right next to our parking spaces, which is why the view into the street is very limited. I therefore always park in reverse and can pull out safely in the morning. 

A few days ago, my mother texted me saying that I shouldn't reverse park any more, otherwise the privacy screen would get dirty from the exhaust fumes. I explained to her why I park backwards. She then first argued and after I declined said that a wooden board should be leaned in front of the privacy screen and the garage. Today she said she expected us to get a board. 

Maybe it's childish, but I'm tired of her constant nagging and I don't see any improvement in the appearance of the garage by putting a wooden board in front of the dark brown garage and privacy screen, which disturbs my assumption that she just wants to exercise control again. They haven't moved the motorhome either. 

Am I the asshole for being stubborn and continuing to park the car backwards and not getting a board?

In addition, my parents moved in across the street last summer and the whole situation was exacerbated by the constant presence of my parents, and my mother in particular. 

Due to the ongoing conflicts, we are already looking for other apartments on the side. However, we are also planning our wedding, which is taking up a lot of our time.

Two weeks ago, my mother asked us to help her reinstall the privacy screen (a wooden gate that has been there for at least 20 years) between our garden and the two parking spaces belonging to our property. This is always removed during the winter as my parents keep their motorhome there for the winter. We spent a whole Sunday helping with this. 

The motorhome is currently parked right next to our parking spaces, which is why the view into the street is very limited. I therefore always park in reverse and can pull out safely in the morning. 

A few days ago, my mother texted me saying that I shouldn't reverse park any more, otherwise the privacy screen would get dirty from the exhaust fumes. I explained to her why I park backwards. She then first argued and after I declined said that a wooden board should be leaned in front of the privacy screen and the garage. Today she said she expected us to get a board. 

Maybe it's childish, but I'm tired of her constant nagging and I don't see any improvement in the appearance of the garage by putting a wooden board in front of the dark brown garage and privacy screen, which disturbs my assumption that she just wants to exercise control again. They haven't moved the motorhome either. 

Am I the asshole for being stubborn and continuing to park the car backwards and not getting a board?

I also asked my wife to take lots of pictures for me and send them to me. 

She wouldn't. She was always busy. Or the kids were busy. Or her parents had the kids. Just lots of excuses. 

And eventually she started complaining about how much time I spent with the kids and taking their pictures and videos. The kids picked up on it and started complaining too. So I cut back. Then I just stopped. 

We got divorced, not because of the pictures but for a plethora of reasons, and I got 50/50 custody. 

It works out great. I work for two weeks and I get two weeks off. So when I'm home I always have my kids. 

I met my wife through a work friend. She is his daughter and would pick him up at the airport when we flew in. She is used to a man she loves earning his living away from home. 

She loves how much I enjoy recording our family. When I'm away she sends me pictures and videos of the kids every day. 

My ex called me the other day to tell me my older kids are jealous of all the pictures I have of their siblings and of how little interest I have in taking pictures of them. 

I have all of our emails going back to when we were married. I just sent them all back to her. 

Me asking her for pictures and her refusing, her telling me that the kids are sick of me taking their pictures and to stop. It went on.

It got to a point where we were playing games with each other every day, and having long conversations well into the night.

 I definitely would have called him my closest friend, and probably still would. He was going through some rough times when we met and as we chatted I helped him get through them, we covered a lot of deep topics and were practically inseperable. 

We live in different timezones and while that had worked well due to our schedules, he started a new school about 6 months ago which meant that playing on weekdays wasn't possible anymore. Which was a shame, but we just made sure to hang out on the weekends as much as possible.

This was fine up until about three months ago when he met a girl, they hit it off and started dating. I was incredibly happy for him, and she sounds really nice. They would hang out almost every day after they finished school and often on weekends too.

Initially this didn't pose much of an issue, we could still play on the weekend and while often it would be cut short due to him doing something with his girlfriend I was more than understanding. However as the weeks went on we started to be able to hang out less and less, with more of our time being cut off so he could hang out with his girlfriend and often just cancelled completely.

At this point we were probably hanging out only once every week for a couple hours, sometimes not at all. I brought up to him a couple times that it was disheartening to me that we were hanging out less and less and I would appreciate it if he would make an effort to hang out with his friend. Anytime this came up it would become a point of contention as he argued that I was being unrealistic and ""clingy"" (although he acknowledged that word was too harsh), he was just becoming busier and busier. 

Gradually we played less and less and now it has been over a month since we have last played. I initially was often asking him when the next time we could hang out would be, or if he would be on that day, but after a while I realised that this was looking to be a one-sided friendship.

my friend group is very incompetent and we just cannot make plans together so we rarely succeed meeting up.  This was just another cancellation for me. I didn't care that much about it


I have this friend group I had a fight with, then only interacted with like 2 ppl from 10 for a month. There was going to be a gathering in a pub. On the day of the gathering I accepted that I kinda overreacted and we reconciled kinda. I had a moment of enlightenment, basically I was angry at the whole group but in reality should've been angry at one or two people. (And he wasn't coming to the pub.)

So I decided I will go to the pub. 

I have a cousin who lives abroad but travelled here to spend the weekend with me. This is why we made the pub stuff anyways. He and I half-jokingly thought about visiting my friend I angered later.

After the decision was made, we actually made plans with the friend in question who lives in another town, kinda far away so we would have needed to wake up early and travel 3 hours by train to have any meaningful time spent there. This friend was the one I interacted with during my isolation from the group.

However it as time went by, we got drunk and had fun and didn't think we would go home early. So I cancelled the trip we would have done tomorrow. I texted him something like "" looks like we aren't going home soon so i guess we won't be coming tomorrow"" . Now I didn't think about it much since why the hell would I write a formal apology letter for a friend I have know for 7 years. I thought he'd be fine but apparently he was not.


Around an hour passed then my cousin felt ill so we went home, it wasn't that late, so we could have still gone to visit the friend.

So I texted that we could go, 
He said this wasn't the first cancellation and we cannot go to him.  Then I wrote"" it's not like you didn't cancel anything in the past"". Then the conversation was over.

4 days silence then I asked him what's up are you still angry? He said yes and said that my cousin apologized for the whole thing but I didnt  so i am a very bad person because I didnt talk to the others but decided last minute to still go to the pub. 

I obviously felt bad but I just didn't think it was such a big thing. Like ok I cancelled it sorry then it's over we move on maybe next time. We've know eachother for 7 years why make a fuss about such a small thing. I didn't even want to apologize after this.

I don't think I did anything wrong, I mightve misunderstood the situation and the conversation but I'm pretty sure I was clear from the start that he can't stay with me. 

But our mutual friends are calling me assholes and the responses to his subtweets are calling me a bitch so

102,1cq9iw6,WIBTA for quoting my mother on something she said,"So my mother (47) and I (15m) agreed on Friday to go out. And this was the specific schedule: We stop off for her doctors appointment, get fuel, then go to 2 shops. The first shop just for a couple of things I wanted, the 2nd shop for 3 things I wanted, and she said she will get ""2 other things"". I hate shopping trips so I clarified that her items will only be 2 or 3, and that they will take about 10 minutes to get. She agreed.

Friday comes, it is all going smoothly and we Even get a nice lunch. Then the shopping. From the first shop, a small Asian shop, I get the stuff I wanted, but I was in a bad mood after because my mum yelled at me in the middle of the shop for putting the food into the bag inefficiently. 

So we went to the huge supermarket, and my mum was getting the ""2-3"" things she needed, while I went to search for my items. I could only find one of them, but she said after she got her items in 5 mins she would come and help me find them, and we set a point to meet in 5 mins. Well she wasnt there, and I spent 20 mins walking up and down the shop trying to find her, and she had a full cart of stuff, nowhere near the original section we had agreed on. She said ""give me 5 more mins then we can get your items"". By that point I had enough, so I just walked out of the shop to sit on the outside benches. She threatened to not buy my items but I Just said go ahead.

I waited outside for literally 40 minutes, and she came out with the cart full. She was furious with me and when we got in the car before she could yell I asked her why she would lie to me, and she acted like she didn't at first, but eventually said quote ""it doesn't matter whether I said 2 items or 200 items"" so just admitting she lied. I stayed completely silent and recorded her yelling on my phone. She started calling me ungrateful and said I should have ""Asked her to sit down and do all the shopping for her"", then she started insulting me and saying I'm an idiot, fat and a ""horrible child"" (phrase doesn't really translate over) which is a phrase we agreed she wouldn't use as it's too far (it's more rude in the language we were speaking in). She then says I ruined her evening and when we got home said something along the lines of (again, doesn't translate well) ""our relationship has ended for today, don't talk to me"".

Well I'm at my dads for the weekend and I seriously think she is in the wrong, so I'm thinking of saying that quote back to her, minus the today, next time she speaks to me, until she apologises. WIBTA?

109,1cq7krz,AITA for telling my brother if he wants my advice then my advice is to let his kids talk to him and ask his wife to sit it out?,"My brother remarried after the loss of his first wife. From his first marriage he has Kyra (14f) and Landen (12m). From his second marriage he has Jane (2) and Thomas (4 months). My brother has been married to ""Jen"" for 5 years. His late wife ""Mary"" has been gone for 7.

Kyra and Landen both have been dealing with some difficult stuff for a while. Kyra is getting bullied and the bullying has escalated to the point my brother has been called multiple times and the parents of one of the children involved actually approached him to apologize. While Landen has struggled in school for many years and was diagnosed with learning disabilities several years ago. This past school year has been his biggest challenge and he gets really down about it and his self-esteem has plummeted to an all-time low. The school have also called about this because it's become clear in the way he talks about himself, even in class.

My brother and Jen attempted to speak to the kids but they weren't talking. He wanted to be there for the kids and for them to open up because they don't talk about it. When they didn't open up he decided therapy could help. This is what led to him finding out they don't want to talk to Jen and don't want to open up to her. He was distressed when he heard this and wanted to know why. The counselor said kids won't always open up to stepparents. My brother said Jen is just a parent though and not a stepparent and the counselor told him the kids don't see it that way.

The thing is, that was always clear. But he wanted to believe that because their mom died, they need a new one and would connect with Jen. Jen wanted to believe the same thing.

So they tried family therapy but the kids would not open up or talk there either and I think it's reasonable to assume it's because Jen is there. My brother certainly believes this is the reason. He has been told the kids do want to speak to him. But he's frustrated because they won't talk. But he doesn't try talking to them alone. He always includes Jen and Jen feels she needs to be included. It has been acknowledged that the kids do need to speak to him at least.

My brother has mentioned this to me before and a few days ago he came to me for advice because ""this is such a difficult topic"" and I told him it's not that difficult, he needs to talk to his kids without Jen there. He said that disrespects her place as their mother figure. I told him he wanted my advice and my advice is to talk to his kids and ask Jen to sit out because they won't talk to her or open up while she's there and that has been clearly communicated and if he really wants to help and support his kids then he needs to be willing to do that and Jen should be able to understand.

He wasn't happy with me and I wonder if I went too far.

110,1cq7d72,"AITA for ""being rude"" to my mom?","I (18f) am a first year college student.

For some context, my mom (41f) uses a lot of social media. She has around 80k followers on Instagram and even more than that on Facebook. She post reels and videos. I'm proud and happy for her. 

Recently, she joined an app where she has to livestream 2 hours a day and she can get paid a Little bit of money. I liked that she was at least happy and having fun. But at this point it is getting out of hand.

She does the livestream in the main bedroom where my parents and brother (10m) sleep. And it has come to a point where we can't even talk in that room. I can't talk to her without her getting annoyed and scolded. I can't even go in the room to talk to my brother cuz us talking ""ruins"" her livestream. 

Initially, it was easy for a 2 hours livestream. But now, as soon as my father leaves home she starts livestream and then she only ends it when he comes home. He works 8 hours a day and 2 hours to and from workplace. We can't anymore without her muting the livestream to scold us with a smile on her face so her ""viewers"" don't think badly of her. There's never anything at home to make or eat nowadays. We have been getting takeout for this exact reason. 

Today, at around 3:30 PM I went to the room after checking the whole house to find something to make and eat but nothing. I go to her. Ask her if there's anything and she says ""there must be those left over from last night"" 'last night' was 5 days ago. I asked her if I could just order something. She said ""yeah let's do that later"". Before I could say anything she shushed me and told me to leave her alone. I assumed later meant 20-30 mins and went back to my room.

I kept waiting until it was around 5:45 then I went back to her. She was still livestreaming. I asked her when her livestream will be over. She said she was getting so many points. I said ""what about food?"". She again asks me if I didn't eat those left over from ""last night"". Again, before I could talk I got shushed. I got really annoyed and just left the room. I went to my grandpa and asked him for some change and sent my brother to a close by small shop to get a pack of biscuits. 

She later came in my room to say I was being rude and that I shouldn't have gotten any money from grandpa cuz she said and I quote ""we can feed two kids ourselves."" I didn't say anything and just focused on the lecture I was listening to on YouTube and then she just left. 

The pack of biscuits had 6 pieces which me and my brother shared 3 each. We both do not get any pocket money. I don't have a bank account. I'm also not allowed to get a job cuz they say my job is to study only. My father never picks up his phone at work since he turns it off. He's a doctor and that's hospital rules so it is not his fault. 

My mom has been scolding me for the past 30 minutes and I just feel guilty and wanna know if I'm the asshole for getting annoyed at her and asking my grandpa for some money instead? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-12,"AITA for ""being rude"" to my mom? I (18f) am a first year college student.

112,1cq65a1,AITA for asking my husband if he did anything for Mother’s Day,"My husband (42m) and I (35f) had a son last year, so this is my first Mother’s Day. We both work remotely.

In April he was on a business trip for a few weeks, while I held down the fort (working remotely while taking care of baby). He’s not the kind of person to really care about holidays, so two weeks ago, a few days after he got home, I told him I cared about Mother’s Day and what I wanted for Mother’s Day—a couple small things including pictures, a new thermos, and to do something together as a family. We’ve had a busy couple of weeks with him settling back in. He does look after baby a lot, but I take bedtime and nighttime duty, and also do a lot during the day. We both cook a lot, and we both do a lot of the chores.

Today (Mother’s Day) I woke up early to feed the baby. My husband was a little awake, so I asked him if I should expect anything for Mother’s Day and if he got anything ready. This is because I honestly would prefer to know so I’m not disappointed. He told me “when would I have the chance?” And started getting upset. On the one hand, I don’t want him feeling bad, but on the other hand he has had two whole weeks to do something, and he could have told me he needed to spend more time out and I would have looked after baby while he did Mother’s Day errands.

He got really upset with me and told me that he never had time. I asked him if we could come back to this conversation later, and that I was sure we would do something for Mother’s Day. But I don’t know if my tone wasn’t right but he got very upset and said that I was abusive, because I was always doing things like this and making him feel really bad. I apologized and said I never want to hurt his feelings, but he scoffed at that and asked if he should expect this for the rest of his life. Then I asked him to step out of the room to calm down while I got the baby back to sleep. After some more back and forth he did, and I’m sitting here writing this now.

I honestly try to be reasonable and listen really carefully to what people I love say, but I feel like I’m crazy right now.

113,1cq5xvz,AITA for being verbally aggressive towards my brother?,"So, this just happened today, and I can't believe the audacity of his words.

Me and my brother's relationship is well....hard to explain. It's between cordial and hostile. Sometimes we argue, sometimes we get along. But now in particular, he is particularly nasty.

So me(27M) and my brother(29M) are having dinner with dinner together. Nothing fancy, just wantan noodles. On another note, I am a little overweight, and time and time I try to minimize the amount of food I eat and try to consume less sugar to lose weight. So I ordered a small plate of wantan noodles and a drink which I specify to have less sugar, which my mom and dad gave me a small praise for. During this time, my brother didn't say anything.

After finishing dinner, my family decided to order shaved ice to share, to which I say no thanks, as it is a little too sweet for me, but they ordered one anyway so the three of them can share. As it came, they dug in and shared the shaved ice, except me. My mom and my brother tried to convince me to have a few bites, with my brother in particular saying a few bites isn't a big deal, but I continue to refuse as I am trying to lose weight. Then, that's when it started. He sarcastically said ""Got use meh?"", in a way saying that it's no use as I am already overweight anyway. I then, got a little aggressive, lightly slamming my drink on the table saying: ""Hey! I am trying to lose weight here!"", to which he then countered with ""Yet you are still ate KFC the other day"", he then defensively claimed I was contradicting myself for eating KFC a week ago, therefore rendering my sudden desire to lose weight moot. 

Then, my mom tried to defuse the situation, saying that I am trying to actually lose weight, and we shouldn't cut each other off when speaking. Things are quiet after that, but we pretty much gave each other evil stares. Only my mom knew about this, not my dad, as he left the table momentarily.

So, AITA for getting verbally aggressive towards my brother because he sarcastically mocked my sudden desire to lose weight?

For the record, she lives in my house and I also have young children who live with me. She said the grandmothers can have Grandparent's Day now (who even celebrates that?) and that Mother's Day should be just about her and celebrating/appreciating her, and she shouldn't have to share ""her day"" with anyone else.  

I didn't bother asking her if I was allowed to celebrate still or not.  Instead, I just laughed at her and said ""Yeah, good luck with that"" before exiting the room.  She hasn't brought it up again but has been kind of cold to me since.  Honestly, I don't think I'm wrong here, but maybe this is a generational etiquette divide (I'm a lot older than her).

They live at a considerably long distance (+300 km) from us. It's either a short plane trip or a long train/car ride.
They see the children between 0 to 3 times a year. Maybe seen the children 30 days in 12 years. 
They both have good jobs and no children. They have seen the children when it was convenient, passing through. Seldom on purpose.

So, this easter  they thought that we should send over the children (12M+7F) for the weekend, said on a wednesday and expecting us to deliver on friday. I think that even if I could have arranged the flights last minute to take the children on their own it would have cost us 400€ at least. I say could bc I checked out of curiosity and of course it was all booked. I think that it was offered just to look good as the fun aunt, I can't be sure.

Appart that H and I are not friends (and hadly friendly tbh) I still think that it 's cheeky of them to expect us to pay so that they can meet the children when they fancy, with not even a weeks advance notice. Overly so when they have never been intrested in the children more than a couple evenings a year.

We had a few agreements between us but for story mostly these 2 are important, first is that whenever some friends are coming to apartment we have to anounce it in group chat and second is if one person is moving out that person needs to find next roomate. So the problems started when one of roomates (lets call her R1) started bringing her friend to apartment a lot.

She didnt do anything about finding next roomate  and later when i found few people interested in renting the room R1 locked the room and i couldnt show these people the main thing they came to see. After all that i spoke to R1 and told her that she has to unlock the room and give me the keys within 1 day otherwise she will lose her deposit and she didnt do it which resulted in us loseing one person interested in renting the room.

",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA for not giving back my roomates deposit after she caused a lot of problems ?  About 4 months ago i moved in new apartment with 2 other roomates and i am the main name on contract. We had a few agreements between us but for story mostly these 2 are important, first is that whenever some friends are coming to apartment we have to anounce it in group chat and second is if one person is moving out that person needs to find next roomate. So the problems started when one of roomates (lets call her R1) started bringing her friend to apartment a lot.

118,1cq4j7k,AITA for not petsitting ‘properly’ and causing a fallout?  ,"My partner and I live around five minutes away from my partners sister and husband and we agreed once we moved here that we would be happy to occasionally pet sit for each other.  

This weekend it was our turn. They have two outdoor cats (not a problem) but one absolutely gigantic St Bernard they treat as their baby. Their flat is small, and he is primarily kept in the living room all day. He usually goes for massive daily walks though. Very hot here and my partner and I are small women so they said it was fine to not walk him while we pet sit

So pop down in the morning around 9am and stay till 11am, everyone’s fed, played with and happy. 

Pop down again around 6pm, only stay for around 45 minutes. 

Now here’s where it all goes downhill. Between visits. Asked my partner to do the last evening check after her work, she hadn’t eaten all day for the nine hour shift and she just popped in for ten minutes at 10pm to give dinner and make sure the cats were home safe and the dog had been out for the bathroom 

As she gets home we get a message asking how they were this evening. I said they were good. Then SIL messages ‘let me rephrase we know you only visited for five minutes we saw on the camera can you go back down and spend actual time with him, we are seriously disappointed’ 

So we message back saying he was completely fine, but she began blowing up my partners phone with messages about how let down she was, how anxious she was about the animals, how we shouldn’t agree to pet sit if we won’t do it properly. We explained I have spent near 3 hours with them today, she fired back that he usually spends 24 hours with someone so 3 hours is nothing. I get that. But we only were told to visit occasionally and now I’m feeling like a shit person. 

We were very uncomfy with the idea that she was watching us on the camera probably every time I was there, she should be enjoying her holiday. 

We said, again, that we understand the anxiety. But they have had their needs met. But no, she went off again saying he needs people time and that one of us needs to back down and watch an episode of a tv show or something with him. Which, I mean, baffling. He’s not an anxious dog, in fact he gets over excited and doesn’t settle when I visit. He paces and can’t relax.

To avoid my partner falling out with her sister I say I’ll go back and sit with him. 11pm till 12am I sat and watched tv then left. He was so tired he was slipping all over the place and didn’t settle. I think I did more harm than good being there personally, but it’s not my dog and my SIL was on her 70th ‘I’m disappointed in you, I have extreme anxiety, you’re letting us down’ but thankfully stopped once I said I was going again. 

So now I’m sitting with him this morning again, and things just feel bloody awkward between the four of us. And I can’t stop glancing at the cameras. AITA here?

120,1cq3y82,AITA for not wanting to move out of my city and live with my girlfriend and her ill sister?,"Short explanation (cross post from Relationship Advice):

My girlfriend \[26F\] and I \[27M\] have been together for over 4 years and we want to move in together. We both currently live with our respective families. Her family has a flat in a nearby small town (30-40min by train) where we could live rent-free. However, her sister, who has health issues, can't and doesn't want to leave their home very often. This means my girlfriend wants to stay close to support her sister and spend time with her, as her sister doesn't have much of a social life outside the family.

My concern is that I'm not comfortable with this arrangement. My girlfriend has started renovating the flat despite my reservations. I tried to find a compromise, but she insists that moving there is the only right thing to do. Her family even suggested her sister having a room in the flat, which makes me uncomfortable. The family is quite toxic, constantly fighting, and I fear getting drawn into their issues. Despite reassurances, I worry the family might be around more than anticipated.

Apart from family concerns, I also worry about my personal needs. I don't know anyone in that town, and all my family and friends are in the nearby big city. I value the cultural amenities and short commute to work (15min now; would be 60min if I moved there), and not needing a car for everything.

I've tried discussing my needs and the benefits of staying in the big city, but my girlfriend seems focused only on her family and financial considerations. She makes me feel guilty, claiming I don't love her if I don't immediately agree to move or that I don't want to live together with her at all.

I feel stuck and don't know how to resolve this. I love my girlfriend, but I don't want to sacrifice everything for her toxic family. I also feel deeply hurt that I'm left out of the whole decision and feel resentful towards my girlfriend since January.

122,1cq3la0,AITA for not giving my cousins food when they declined,"
I (13Ftm) recently had a few of my cousins over for a meeting for a group competition we're in. They arrived 3 hours early when I was still asleep. We decided to play a couple of board games whilst we waited for our last cousin to arrive, on time. During this waiting, I got hungry, I had just woken up by that point and hadn't eaten breakfast. I asked my cousins if they had breakfast or were hungry, they said no. 

I decided 'Ok, they're not hungry, ill make myself some soup and egg'. 

When making my breakfast I asked them again if they wanted any of mine. They said no. 

So I made my breakfast and ate it. If they had breakfast at their house, they were full, their breakfasts aren't large, but bigger than average. So saying they weren't hungry was pretty safe. 

Hours go by, we finish our meeting, I'm drying dishes while my mom cooks (I don't know why she was cooking, she made it pretty clear to both me and my dad she didn't want to, although that's pretty normal for her). All of a sudden my mom starts going off about how it was extremely rude selfish and bad mannered what I did and I should never do it again. Quick note: these kinds of blasts are again, pretty normal and I just wanted to check if I was genuinely these things she was claiming. 
Besides she's called me worse and calling me,  bad mannered and a horrible host are just to be expected after any kind of guest we have comes. 

Anyway, I asked them three times, I told her this, she still held up to her statement saying it was very rude and I should make food for them anyways, even if they decline and say they are fine, she says its good manners and I should always make food for everyone, even if its just her. This statement stock out to me because she always tells me to make for her after I've made something for myself, even if its just a little snack, she then takes either 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 of my portion and tells me to make more for myself, I'm adding this for context to make you possibly understand why this caught my attention.

123,1cq3a2v,AITA for giving different gift values to my sils for their wedding?,"AITA for giving one of my sil ( husband's cousin) jewelry as gift for her wedding and giving his other cousin a simple gift?

Background: I (31f) got married to my hubby (33m) last year in November. Prior to that we were in a ldr and we are not from the same nationality. I am African and he is Indian. We are both of the same religion.

Post our wedding, I shifted to India and his family ( mum,dad and elder bro) have welcomed me very happily and made me a part of the family.  What a joyous union it was, and much to my relief, his family welcomed me with open arms. Most of his relatives embraced me with warmth and respect, and I found a special bond with one of his aunts and her daughter ( aunt (50)- Maya and daughter(26)-Ahana) . They showed me kindness and always treated me with the utmost respect. My bond with Ahana is a really great one. We share our small secrets just like two normal sisters would do

 Another aunt Roma ( aged 50) and her daughter (28) Tina displayed a shocking disdain and racism towards me. It pained me deeply to face such hostility in the midst of what should have been a joyous time. They said things like "" oh you are not a good match for our boy. He is so fair and you are so dark. I am of wheatish color. I never ever felt any discomfort in my skin color . I am proud of my indo African roots. They also say things like "" you have trapped him"". I am a lawyer and he's an IT Engineer.  

For Ahana's wedding ( this February) , me and my hubby decided to be graceful with what we will be gifting her .  Ahana was in love with my wedding necklace set and always wanted something similar for her wedding.  So I decided to buy a similar one for her wedding but with different gemstones. When we showed her the gift,  she jumped out of excitement and hugged me and my husband and said"" you are the best. I love you"". 
The wedding happened and everything went on smoothly.  

in April  we have been informed that  Tina also will be getting married in September. So my husband and I  decided that we'll give her money as gift. 

She and her mum came to our place yesterday and while talking,  Tina said"" Bhabhi for my necklace, don't use gemstone but use diamonds only "". I was a bit taken aback  and so was my husband.  I calm told her ""what are you talking about"" ? She then told me "" Oh you got Ahana such an expensive gift so even I deserve one that's I am telling you my preferences""


I told her that the gift to Ahana was a gesture to show how I appreciated their love and kindness 
And as far as you're concerned you'll get your gift but not the necklace.  She told me "" you are joking right "". my husband then said no we are serious and this is our final decision and consider whatever we are giving to be enough because of how rude and insulting you two were towards my wife.
Tina called me a bitch and went away with her mum.
I am now reconsidering my decision.
Should I give her a Similar gift or be firm.of what me and my husband decided.

UPDATE: ( 13.O5.2024)
 Thought of updating you people who have supported me.
So after their visit, me and my husband thought that everything has been cleared out. Oh Boy, how wrong were we.

Yesterday we received a phone call from Tina's Grandmother (who is also my husband's grandmother). She started berating me about how I am discriminating between the girls and how I am her grandson against the family and how ungrateful I am because apparently she ""let"" my husband marry me.

She even started taunting my parents and started saying that they didn't raise me properly and how I don't obey to elders. 

All I could do was to hear her and sob. She hung up. And my husband who listened to the whole ordeal decided to have a group call on whatsapp where he has specifically pointed out what has happened and how I am being treated. He said "" I love and respect my family but not at the cost of my wife's self respect.  She is my priority.  I love and respect her more. So it's my decision and mine only that me and my wife will not attend Tina's wedding nor we will be giving her any kind of gifts.""
He said all these and left the call and the group. 
My Mil called us  saying that she understand us and supports us so even my in laws won't be attending the wedding.

And my husband who listened to the whole ordeal decided to have a group call on whatsapp where he has specifically pointed out what has happened and how I am being treated. He said "" I love and respect my family but not at the cost of my wife's self respect.  She is my priority.  I love and respect her more. So it's my decision and mine only that me and my wife will not attend Tina's wedding nor we will be giving her any kind of gifts.""
He said all these and left the call and the group. 
My Mil called us  saying that she understand us and supports us so even my in laws won't be attending the wedding.  
My bil , he has a carefree attitude ,he doesn't care about people says or does so he won't be attending also.

I am feeling happy and sad at the same time
Happy because of the support I am receiving 
Sad because of what should be a joyful event has now turned out to be an estrangement. ",0.0,0.015376689843833447,0,1

I've been with my partner for 15 years. We've been married for 6. I know his family, and I used to always accompany my partner to gatherings. 

About 1.5 years ago, we took a break. We got back together about a year ago. When we first got back together, he didn't seem to want to be seen with me. We didn't go out in public together and he'd never take me around his family. 

I know he isn't with somebody else. I figured that he wanted to keep things private, because he wasn't sure we'd stay together. Perhaps he had some fear of abandonment issues, since our relationship had ended before. So, I gave him time. I eventually brought up my concerns.  I told him that he didn't have to do anything he didn't want to, but let him know how it made me feel.

We, now, go out together. However, he still doesn't bring me around his family. He has spent Christmas, Thanksgiving, my birthday, etc at his family's and left me home to spend the holidays alone.

I've expressed that this makes me feel isolated and unappreciated. That it feels like he is ashamed of me. But he just says that he wants to keep his life private. Nothing ever changes. 

I brought it up a third time, recently. I told him that he never has to invite me anywhere. His reasons are his own and may be perfectly valid. But I don't want to live like this anymore. That was it. No more conversation. He just went to sleep, then I left.

I've talked to a mutual friend about it, and they said that I was overreacting. They said that it was an AH move to bring it up, and that it was wrong for me to end things over it.

One member who we will call ""Patty,"" became increasingly negative and entitled. We tolerated it for a while, but it got too much, especially her constant put-downs were particularly aimed at me.
For my 18th birthday, I decided not to invite Patty. I knew her negativity would ruin the party.  My parents agreed with my decision especially my mom who had witnessed her behavior first hand. When Patty found out afterwards she did her usual complaining. a friend had told me about it and I told them to tell her I'd be happy to talk calmly, but it never happened. A few other things happened during that year and I went no contact with her after graduation due to other reasons.
Recently, my parents called my decision immature even though knowing why.

We have to boys, aged 8 and 11. They're great kids and I love them dearly. To me, this day is about celebrating our bond. 

On fathers day, I make sure to have done grocery shopping so that I can surprise him with some orange juice and strawberries, or something special for breakfast. I make sure to have little gifts but most importantly, I make sure to include our kids. I think it is very important to show them how to treat your loved ones. 

This morning, the kids where watching. My husband went downstairs to make breakfast. When they were little, they would help him and would give a little drawing or whatever they made at school. I have such fond memories of their little footsteps on the stairs and giggles of excitement.

This year, it was just my husband. He had made me a stale sandwich and give me a gift card. 

I asked him where the kids where and he said he didn't want them bickering. I thanked him for the sandwich and gift card, but couldn't keep my composure. I started crying and he asked why. I told him that mothers day is about the children. I don't expect a gift from him, I'm not his mom. The only thing I want for him to accommodate our boys. Go to the dollar store or whatever and ask them to pick out a little something for mommy. Or ask them to make a drawing. Or at the very least, ask them to help make breakfast and bring it upstairs. 

One year they went to the thrift shop. I loved it! My youngest picked up an outrageous neckles and I wore it with proud. It's not about the money. It about showing them how to be affectionate to the ones you love. 

He went downstairs angry. I'm in bed crying. Am I the asshole? 


UPDATE:
So I went downstairs this morning to make some tea. I hugged my kids and played a game with my youngest. My husband and oldest son snuck out and came back with a flower and chocolates. I hugged and thanked him. Afterwards I had an open conversation with my husband about expectations and what mothers day means to me. He ended up making me a lovely lunch and we went to the beach.

Two years ago I met a guy (I'll call him John) we became friends really fast. we got really close, we exchanged numbers, texted almost everyday. He's the best person I've ever met. May, 2022 he began being distant. It started small, that summer he started only texting if I did first. Then he wouldn't respond often. If it was important, then he'd be there. I know it sounds like he didn't care, only stuck around because he's a good person, but that's not it. I questioned it too, but knew it wasn't true. Still I was paralyzed with anxiety about confronting him. I waited a year. I didn't mean to wait so long. There were times when things were kinda getting better, I would wait more. plus in this time he did say that I was his best friend, and on the rare occasion we had a meaningful conversation he always told me he cared about me. Decided to nfront him after school ended.

That day I texted him, we talked. He explained why he'd been so distant, he had a valid reason. After that we were better than ever.

A month later (last July) he started being how he’d been when he was first being distant. So later I confronted him, things got a bit better. He was still a distant. I knew it was just stuff he was dealing with. But it didn't stop me from being anxious. August 9th, I called a friend (I'll call him lucas) and started opening up about feeling anxious about stuff with John. So in an anxious haze I mentioned leaving him. Lucas told me later that he would've told me to talk to John, but he thought telling me to leave him was what I wanted to hear. ATP I'd been crying for a minute, when he said I should leave I was sobbing. I never wanted to leave, I didn't know what to do, my anxiety did what it always did, tell me to leave. I texted John asking to call, he couldn't, we agreed to talk the next day. Then I second guessed things, texted Lucas, he told me I was right to leave. I spent the day in a haze. When I finally spoke to John, I was really trying to say what I wanted to. But, I didn't even know what that was, the reason I was leaving was because Lucas said it was the right thing to do. I knew he was trying, I was just scared. I wasn't thinking, so I gave a bad goodbye, told him I'd always care about him. He said the same. I started thinking 5-10 steps away, I regretted it. I’d do anything to go back, turn around, tell him I didn't want to leave him. I didn't. I texted him a month later apologizing, he never replied. We only spoke a couple times after that, just saying happy holidays. In March I tried to apologize, it didn't work. I sent him a happy birthday text, he replied. Idk if he did to be polite tho.

I was used to it and not really too bothered so it took me by complete surprise when he had asked, but I was touched and teared up after the call because I was so grateful to be thought of rather than forgotten about or purposely left out like I was in the past.

Then I began to think on it and wonder if his girlfriend was truly comfortable with the idea, I didn’t want her to be uncomfortable despite any previous negative feelings so I reached out to her to double check and be sure it was okay. At first she said that it did feel weird to her but she didn’t feel like she could say anything without it being an argument between her and my ex but that it was okay for me to come. I told her if she’d like I could come up with some kind of excuse to back out and after that she had told me that after speaking with me, she felt more at ease with the whole thing and that I should come. 

When I had told my boyfriend (24M) about this situation, he at first said that he was fine with it and that he trusted me. Later he called and told me that he really didn’t think he was comfortable with it after all, that it should be something I take my significant other with me for and he felt weird about my ex having asked me to dinner in the first place and that it would be like if he asked his ex out to dinner (they don’t have a child together though and I pointed that out). For some context, my boyfriend doesn’t have a vehicle at the moment and he hasn’t received his first paycheck yet since going back to work, so I felt it would be “not right” of me to invite him and leave my ex to pay his way nor did I want to pay for my boyfriend’s meal on Mother’s Day since I’ve been paying for everything my boyfriend had needed after he quit his last job. I also felt it would be rude to invite or push for an invite to bring someone else along that my ex had not mentioned or invited himself since this whole thing was his plan.

I think me going would be beneficial for my son so he can see that mom and dad have a healthy and civil relationship with one another, but I wonder if with all things considered that it would be best for everyone in the long run if I did not go.

So I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend Susan (21F, not her real name) for a year now. Things have been great between us as we keep good communication.

I'm posting this a two days after her birthday, which is also the time where the incident happened. I'd like to say that I'm very romantic, and my girlfriend can vouch that for me, as for her birthday, I had planned a whole long-day schedule of her favorite activities, along with some extras I poked here and there, like taking her to the movies, going out to Red Lobster (despite me not enjoying sea food at all) and some more. 

This is the part where my mother Claudia (42F, again, not a real name) comes into play. Due to medical issues, she's prone to having sudden epileptic attacks with no prior warning, so me and my step-dad Robert (52M, not a real name) have always been on the look out and wary of this, hence we are in contact at least once a day. 

Now, my girlfriend is very well aware of this, and I've warned her since day one. This never bothered her, and she's been always supportive of me and my father (I've grown close to him and call him dad sometimes) , although my mom's attacks have gotten in the way if our hangouts once or twice before.

We were out at red lobster, and we were midway through our meal when I got a call. I picked up the phone since it was my step dad. I might be the asshole here, because I just dropped everything and took off running, as you all can expect, my mother had an attack and my dad told me to come over. 

Though, by the time I arrived, my step dad told me that things were under control, and that it was just a scare because she suddenly felt dizzy, lightheaded and her head started to hurt. 

I thought that'd be the end of it but it turned out to be a true attack, as she started to have a seizure in the living room and we had to rush her to the doctor. 

It took a good 30 minutes for her to stabilize, and I called my girlfriend to let her know that mom was okay, and that if she wanted, we could resume our date. 

She told me that she didn't want to anymore, and that I was an asshole for leaving her like that and ruining her special day, which she's told her friends, who've sent me messages telling me how much of an asshole I am.

Molly would tell me things that were extremely triggering, things that I can't say here. I was extremely worried for Molly and crying for her all the time, on my hands and knees praying, and basically tearing myself apart to try to help her. She knew it was affecting me, and she knew I was terrified for her and crying for her, literally believing she would die. 

I had a feeling she could be lying; after all, this is the online world. However, we had called so many times and I felt like I knew her extremely well. I also thought, ""who in their right mind would lie about these things?"" She was a great friend to me, and her friend from real life was also my friend, so I figured she wouldn't lie to me if she knew her irl friend could expose the truth. 

Getting back on topic, she told me these terrible things that made me worry for her mental and physical health. She said she was going through things that I have gone through, and I can't say what those things are but trust me, they aren't good, and she knew I went through them. She'd send me photos of things she had done to herself, begging me to not say a word to anyone, even though she was also telling our other online friends. 

At this point, I thought she would be dead soon, so I reached out to her irl friend, who we will call Vanessa. I sent Vanessa screenshots of things Molly told me and explained everything to her, and she ended up reaching out to Molly's mom in-person to see if she could keep an eye on Molly. Molly's mom said that Molly was completely fine, that she was on no medication, never went to hospital, and denied everything Molly went through. Me, Vanessa, and our other friends who Molly had spoken to about her supposed issues ended up discussing things together for an entire month, trying to figure things out, and after lots of proof, conversation, and reaching out to the people in Molly's real life, we discovered she had lied about her extreme mental health conditions and her entire personality.

I then messaged Molly and had a civil conversation with her, and she admitted to lying.

141,1cq0hr0,AITA for wanting my brother to spend time to do something for our mom on Mother's Day?,"I (21F) had a disagreement with my brother (23M) regarding Mother's day and I wanted to seek some outside perspective.

I was planning on grabbing lunch and flowers for our mom and told my brother the plans for it ahead of time, but tonight he told me he had a practice presentation with his group (online) at noon that he just found out about so he told me to do it myself, and that he'll pay for half.

The lunch we were planning to get for her is an hour drive, so I said no worries I could pick it up, but I asked him if he could pick up the flowers for her after his presentation since it's right next to our house and would take less than 10 minutes to do.

He responded by saying ""why can't you just get them while you are out anyway,"" and I got frustrated at his response and told him I'm already spending an hour to get the food, why can't he take a few minutes of his day to do something nice for our mom, and accused him of not caring for our mom. In response, he told me ""whatever no flowers then"" and I got mad and said I'll just do everything myself then since it seems like he doesn't care. He just said ""ok so do it, i'm busy, you can't pick up some flowers.""

I got extremely frustrated and told him off by saying ""no \*\*\*\* i can but i'm giving you an opportunity to do something nice for our mom but you don't care so whatever"" and he didn't respond after that. Of course I appreciate that he would pay for half, but the fact he can't take less than 10 minutes out of his day to get flowers for our mom who literally does everything for us makes me so upset. I'm busy as well as it's final season in school but I'm willing to put aside some time for our mom on a special day.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA for wanting my brother to spend time to do something for our mom on Mother's Day? I (21F) had a disagreement with my brother (23M) regarding Mother's day and I wanted to seek some outside perspective.

I was planning on grabbing lunch and flowers for our mom and told my brother the plans for it ahead of time, but tonight he told me he had a practice presentation with his group (online) at noon that he just found out about so he told me to do it myself, and that he'll pay for half.

The lunch we were planning to get for her is an hour drive, so I said no worries I could pick it up, but I asked him if he could pick up the flowers for her after his presentation since it's right next to our house and would take less than 10 minutes to do.

He responded by saying ""why can't you just get them while you are out anyway,"" and I got frustrated at his response and told him I'm already spending an hour to get the food, why can't he take a few minutes of his day to do something nice for our mom, and accused him of not caring for our mom. In response, he told me ""whatever no flowers then"" and I got mad and said I'll just do everything myself then since it seems like he doesn't care. He just said ""ok so do it, i'm busy, you can't pick up some flowers.""

I got extremely frustrated and told him off by saying ""no \*\*\*\* i can but i'm giving you an opportunity to do something nice for our mom but you don't care so whatever"" and he didn't respond after that. Of course I appreciate that he would pay for half, but the fact he can't take less than 10 minutes out of his day to get flowers for our mom who literally does everything for us makes me so upset. I'm busy as well as it's final season in school but I'm willing to put aside some time for our mom on a special day.

Honestly, we were very different personalities when we met, but slowly she started adapting a lot of things that I like. I mean, her style changed, her preferences changed, which I think is the effect of KDRAMAS that I introduced to her. But she even admits that I've influenced her life a lot, and to be honest, this is not the first time I'm hearing this from a friend. I have a best friend from school, and she also says this. She always says that I've influenced her life a lot. They were very introverted personalities before meeting me, and I changed their way of thinking a lot. I don't know how I influenced them, but honestly, in the past few years, I think I've changed a lot. My personality is turning into an introvert, and sometimes I feel that it's because I'm surrounded by introverts and it's kinda sucking my energy. Or I should say that they are influencing my personality, and honestly, I hate being introverted, because now I just have too much social anxiety that it's hard for me to even speak in public.

Anyways, back to the point. So, K never makes notes of her own. We have the same subjects, and she often asks me for the notes. I always gave her all my notes, but slowly I realized that she does nothing the whole year, and after getting my notes, she even passed exams with flying colors. Now, college is about to finish. We are giving final semester exams, but from last year, there is this thought in my mind which tells me that she is just using me for notes. Even though she always compliments me and says that I'm her real friend, I would never want bad for her. But I always feel that she is doing all this because of notes. I think I feel being used because I think she is not adding anything productive in this friendship. But then I also think friendship is not about that. I work hours on the screen trying to find all the notes materials, PYQs, and then find important points from them and put them together. And mind y'all, I have a migraine problem, so using a screen is not a good thing for me.

I feel so guilty about thinking this. What if I'm wrong, and I'm just making assumptions in my mind? I would like some of you guys to tell me what's right.

143,1cpzs9a,AITA for letting the cat pee on my BFs clothes?,"I (18F) have been dating my bf (17M) for a few months now. Everything has been great and he is a wonderful person to be with but there is one thing, his lack of hygiene. He constantly has a messy room with clothes everywhere, dishes on his desk, and trash strewn about. There is even a smell I don’t even know how to describe but apparently he doesn’t notice or he doesn’t care. 

I’ve tried to talk to him multiple times about cleaning his room. Both in indirect and direct ways and at one point I even offered to clean it just so he wouldn’t have to. He automatically said no and changed the topic. 

There is this one part in his room that we both have dubbed “The Pile” which consists of dirty clothes, clean clothes, and even months old food and garbage. (I should say that he has a closet, but refuses to use it) He will use this pile as his closet and will pull clothes out of it to wear. 

So a few days ago I was in his room and he was busy playing a game on his computer. I just happened to look over and see one of his cats peeing in the pile and instead of saying something I decided to stay quiet to see if maybe he’ll notice that the clothes he leaves out smells like cat pee. He didn’t and then complained to me about the cat peeing on his clothes later on that day.

144,1cpzrss,AITA for Painting a Friend without Asking Their Permission?,"I, 21M, am a visual arts/graphic design major at a mid-sized liberal arts college. I take lots of photos and design flyers for several student clubs, and also take studio art classes. My friend ""Jane"", 19F, is another student at the same college, but not in the same department as I am. 

Background: We've had some classes together, go to some of the same groups, and she's asked me to take fancy photos for her at events. We didn't have classes together this past semester, and I haven't seen her a ton.

My school has a visual arts exhibition competition at the end of the semester that students taking studio arts courses submit their work to. I submitted a couple things, but the night before everything was due, decided to make something new. I found a photo that I'd taken of Jane at an event (taken at her request – it was a public speaking thing, and she sent it to her mother afterwards) and used it as the basis for a new painting that I entered in the exhibition competition. 

The next time I saw Jane, I told her that I'd made a painting of her and that she could see it in the gallery. To my surprise, she told me that she found it unsettling, and that I should ask for permission before painting someone. I, of course, apologized immediately, but she hasn't spoken to me since. Am I the asshole?

Reasons why I think I might be the asshole: 

* We're at a college that emphasizes asking permission for anything remotely dating-related, touching people, etc. 
* Clearly, I made her upset. Who wants to do that to someone?
* I think I misjudged a more acquaintance-type interaction for a closer friendship. I wouldn't just go and paint a stranger that I didn't have a prior relationship with.

Reasons why I'm less sure that I'm the asshole:

* A bunch of other people at our school surprised me earlier with a photo that they'd taken, printed, and put in an end-of-the-year gift. I didn't know they'd taken the photo, but it was a pleasant surprise. Jane was one of the people who signed it.
* Jane and I have given each other birthday gifts in the past, and she's asked my help on several occasions.

For whatever it's worth this is the first time that I ever painted someone outside of class. (The school hires models for that.)

Some context: we are in townhouses, share a common wall but have never heard neighbours or TVs or music on either side—including rowdy uni students on our other side. The neighbours who left this note: husband is actually pleasant and friendly, wife has cussed at us and slammed door in our face when we’ve gone to have a conversation.

We’re definitely not blameless:

-              We put rubbish in their bin twice during summer (on morning of bin collection), as they have an extra bin for some reason that is never empty and ours fills up with nappies, but second time some flies got in and neighbours found maggots in their bin as a result! Totally understand they were grossed out, that’s pretty awful! (We wrote a very apologetic letter and came around twice to offer to clean their bins or arrange new ones, but the husband declined).

-              They offered to let us park our car slightly over the line in front of their garage as they don’t have a car. We told them to let us know if they ever needed the space back. Also left them a bottle of wine at Christmas and a card thanking them for being such great neighbours.

-              We do have a 3 month old baby, our second. Our first (before these neighbours moved in) cried a lot at night but our current baby (only one they have known) sleeps through the night and cries a few minutes a day when he’s hungry—we’re the luckiest parents we know. She left another note under our door one day when we were having a Bluey family dance party at 5pm and she said the music was too loud: we went over and apologised in person and told them they could always knock on our door and let us know if they ever needed anything or wanted to chat.

-              We politely asked (in person) the husband if he could stop smoking out the back in the adjoining yards, as the smoke goes straight into our home and the baby’s room (and I was diagnosed with cancer last year). He said he was happy to smoke in the front garage instead, then he recently started smoking out the back again recently so we asked again (because we weren’t even sure if it was him or a different neighbour had started)—I think this must be what triggered this latest note.",Asshole,2024-05-12,"AITA for asking the neighbour's husband to smoke in the garage?

I, 19M just celebrated my 19th birthday with my cousin and her boyfriend (both 21). We were supposed to have another friend of mine (20M) come with us, and I had asked another friend (19F) to get the 20M. The 19F (we'll call her ava), while also not inviting her. I know I was wrong for that, and I've since made amends, and that was fine. The only problem now, is that ava has been nonstop trying to ruin my life, telling my friends that I'm ""untrustworthy"" and ""a hidden devil"" and spreading other rumors.

So for some background, ava hasn't always had a great life, and thrives in attention. Any situation that isn't already about her, she'll make it about her, whether it be trauma-dumping to shift the attention or talking about her boyfriend and how ""awesome and heroic"" he is. I had talked to her about this before, saying that her trauma-dumping and self-centered tendencies have been causing problems, and she hasn't stopped. I told her if it didn't I wouldn't invite her to come with us to lunch for my birthday.

This is why she says I'm the asshole: I told her that I didn't want to have my birthday celebration overshadowed by awkward trauma-dumping and uncomfortable sexual remarks about her boyfriend (who would also not be in attendance). I told her that I didn't want to run the risk of having a fun day with some family and friends be overshadowed by her trauma, even if she said she wouldn't (she's said she wouldn't trauma dump in other scenarios in the past, but still did, so not a good track record). Once I told her that I chose not to invite her because of this, she blew up on me, calling me a ""disappointment"" and a ""disgusting excuse of a human being"". Call me self-centered if you see fit, but I just didn't want to constantly have to hear about someone elses problems over and over again on a day that should be fun. So, am I the asshole?

Edit: For a little more context, throughout planning my birthday, ava had always tried to slot herself into the plans, without having been invited, which in the end, really made me not want to invite her. She just kept trying to find a way to get in, even when we voiced that we didn't want her to.

Edit 2: Another thing I should clear up, A friend outside of this group who's been around Ava a few times at functions had reminded me after I had initially asked Ava to bring 20M, and I had told her that she didn't have to, and explained that she wasn't invited this time around, and that someone else could get 20M.

And if getting a divorce from my Mom is what that means, I won't like it, but I'll accept it. But I don't like the fact that he cheated on my Mom. I hate the fact that he called me several times throughout the year, even a few days ago, helping me with my finals, and getting Gina to talk to me as if nothing was happening. I hate that he and Gina visited me and pretend as if nothing ever happened. I hated the fact that my Mom felt forced to tell me instead of him while crying, when it should have been him, as he is the one to blame. I'll talk to him one day, but not any day soon.

But after all of the texts I've been getting though, about how my Dad misses me, how he was miserable, how I am punishing him for finally being happy, I feel a little conflicted. Am I missing something? ",0.0,0.004406395368278027,0,1
149,1cpypx2,AITA for making my mom a painting for mother’s day?,"Am I the asshole for making my mom a painting for mother’s day? Ok so for a bit of background info, my mom has been struggling with mental health recently. She was very abused as a child and has an insane amount of trauma. For my whole life, she’s suppressed all of this, and didn’t cry or breakdown much. Recently, however, my mom had a very bad experience with a friend and had a complete mental breakdown. Of course, my family and I were there to support her through it all. My dad is often at work, however, and my brother goes to school for 8 hours a day. 

This left me to be the one to be there for her the most, and honestly it was pretty stressful. I’m not going to specify my age, but I’m in high school. It’s not awful, but I feel like I might be a bit young for the amount of pressure they were putting on me. Whenever my mom would have another breakdown it would be my fault for not being there to help her, or it would be my fault for triggering her through simple things like putting my cup in the dishwasher wrong. 

Thankfully, my mom got better and we were all pretty happy, but she never stopped getting mad at me for little things like not making my bed or sitting in a chair wrong. My mom isn’t abusive or anything, but she would usually start crying and asking me why I hated her, or tell me how “you’re the reason I’m depressed”. Normally, when my dad or brother hear this happening they just try to change the subject or ignore it, and we go on with our life. 

That is until last night, when we all went shopping for mother's day gifts. It was going pretty well, and my dad and brother are super chill most of the time. That all changed when we went into 5 below, though. I saw that they had new water color markers, and asked them both if they thought she would like a painting for mother’s day. I honestly didn’t mean anything by it, I just thought it would be a nice gift seeing as I love painting and my mom loves homemade gifts. 

My dad was immediately shocked and told me I was selfish, and my brother told me that “I was the reason mom’s depressed”, which hurt a lot because until then I had thought my moms breakdowns were due to trauma and she hadn’t actually meant anything by it. I asked them what they meant and they told me that “I shouldn’t be pushing my hobbies on her” and it was selfish for me to buy the pens when I would be using them for myself later. 

I didn’t get mad at them and agreed, being able to see their point, but honestly it’s starting to worry me. I always thought that I wasn’t the problem and my mom was just lashing out on me because of other things, but hearing my dad and brother say it makes me wonder if it really is my fault. My side of the story is probably a bit bias and I there may be things I don’t even realizing that I’m doing, but I swear I’m trying my hardest not to mess up and it’s never my intention to hurt her.

150,1cpylu1,AITA for telling my best friend to take a tiktok hate page down...,"So for context me (f18) and my now ex best friend (f17) had been friends for over ten years... We were goofing off one night on Face time and she said "" I'm gonna make a hate page on our school ""... I didn't like the idea but I went along with it because I thought she was joking... 2 days later a tiktok page gets created about our school (keep in mind we are still in highschool about to graduate) I didn't like it so I told her the right thing to do was take it down. She was bullying a lot of people at my school on that page and I was the one reporting all of the videos. It got so bad to the point I started to worry about the people that she was posting about. I told my mom because I go to her for everything and she ends up telling her mom about it. I tried to stop my mom but she doesn't take this stuff lightly. Her mom said she already knew about it and that she's ok with it (she didn't know about it because this is what made my ex best friend mad). The account ended getting banned. The next day I wait for her in the parking lot to tell her I'm sorry for telling my mom... She crossed her arms and kept walking as if I wasn't there. When I got to class I didn't sit in my usual seat because it was next to her and I wanted to give her some space like I usually did when she was mad at me. I sat by my other friends instead. She ends up blocking me on Snapchat and posting a whole bunch of petty TIKTOKS about her other friends to get back at me. I blocked her on tiktok and did the same (I even made sure to block her first so she wouldn't see it)... I didn't even say bad things about her I'm my tiktoks I was just saying nice things about my other friends. When I got home I broke down in tears. She was saying such mean things about me in her TIKTOKS. My other friends kept me updated because they blocked her yet... She posted a tiktok establishing that we wasn't friends anymore and kept posting about this as if it was my fault... I get that it was kinda my fault for telling my mom but she's the one that started the fight. Later that night I call my cousin in tears and she posted a a tiktok about her to take up for me and also texted her to take up for me. I ended up texting her on my brother's phone to take up for myself. She took screenshots and edited the message and said I told her to kh$. The next morning I get texts from my mom saying that her mom wanted to talk to my mom about it or she's calling the police. My mom took up for me saying this is bullshit and that it should have never escalated that far. My mom also said this is not worth her time and she told my ex best friends mom to go ahead and call the police... She didn't. And she continued to post mean tiktok about me and even got her other friends to post bullshit tiktoks about me... For therapy I riped all of our pictures up and wrote her a note and burned it. It helped but now she's still posting stuff about me and so is her friends... She is also threatening to be@t me up for this.
