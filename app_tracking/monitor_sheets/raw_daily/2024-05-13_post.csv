0,1cr97yo,AITA for spending all my time w my bf instead of my stepdad on vacation?,"It's been a bit since this happened, but it's still got me a bit pressed. At the time, I was 17 FTM, with my boyfriend 19 FTM. For my senior year of highschool, I really wanted to go on a trip, and since my family gave my sister 2000 for her graduation gift, I was given that amount too. 

I decided I wanted to go to Japan, where my boyfriend was currently spending a gap year with extended family. I've always wanted to see Japan, and me and my boyfriend had been long distance for almost 2 years, so I let my stepdad, 42 M, know. I used the graduation money for both plane tickets, and had to save up my own money for literally everything else. Since I was underage, my stepdad had to go with me. He refused to plan any of the trip, leaving everything up to me including stuff like passports itenary and hotels etc. He told me not to plan anything for him since it was my trip.

However, when we got there, all my stepdad did was complain. He didn't like that we weren't doing basic tourism things, and that I was doing stuff we could ""do in America."" Tourism isn't really my thing, and I like to experience the culture in more simple ways. He didn't care how happy I was or how I was spending my time, and often stopped activities I had planned. He also disliked my bf, and said he was too cocky, spoiled, and controlling (for simply giving directions and instructions). 

Eventually, my step dad blew up at my bf for giving directions at the zoo, screaming in front of crowds of people and my bfs cousin, 6 M. My bf yelled at him, saying it ""wasn't just his trip"" before my dad grabbed me and stormed off from our ride home. He called my mother to insult my boyfriend while screaming at me for crying, and claimed I was spending too much time with my bf. After finally making it back, he refused to let me see or text my bf, kicking him out of the hotel his mother paid for. 

He then began to purposefully misgender and deadname my bf when he found out. We were allowed one single date together for a few hours, before we could never see each other again. He changed all my plans and made almost everyhting about what he wanted to do. My stepdad claimed that the trip was so much better, and that my bf never should have come. 

I was numb for the rest of the trip and had to fake it till I made it back home. He still hates my bf all because of it, and hates that im still dating him and side with him. All of it (along with other things) lead me to leave the house, and he is absolutely furious. Am I really in the wrong for thinking my stepdad was an asshole?

2,1cr46ep,WIBTAH for not telling my parents in law about my gender reassignment surgery?,"I (24ftm) have top surgery coming soon. I have told very few people about it because it's my decision, my body and I hate people's uncomfortable comments. They always ask intrusive questions or try to talk me out of it. Everything is already booked. There's no turning back for me and it's what I want. 

My boyfriend (24m) is very supportive and loving. He is very close to his family and wants them to know about this big milestone in my life. His parents already know I'm trans but they're weird about it. They accept it, but they pry. They also really dislike me because of my ""off putting personality"". They dislike how shy and meek I am. They think it's creepy how I always offer to help them clean when they host me. I don't know how to act around them.

I don't want to tell them about the surgery. I rather just keep it private. Only my boyfriend and my family will know. I haven't told many friends. Only other queer people because they don't ask intrusive questions like straight people do. They understand how uncomfortable it is. Just cause I want my boobs gone doesn't mean I want you to ask me about my V. 

Despite this, I know it'll make them angry that I didn't tell them once they notice the change. I don't get shirtless ever but what if I randomly do one day? It'll be found out eventually. I might as well be the first to say it. I just don't want too. 

Anyways. Would I be the ass hole for keeping it private?

I come from a big family, and all the cousins are very close, but we have our own tight knit groups due to being raised in close proximity and also age/gender. She moved to Florida when she was 5 so she nvr got to solidify that connection, but when she comes around we make an effort to take her out and catch up. Yesterday we took her to the city, hung out and talked all day. Today I find out through my older male cousins that she’s planning on getting married next year, here in our hometown. She’s even looking at venues and everything. She never mentioned that at all. It irritated me to find out this way because just last December, I got into a big family argument because her mom threw the female cousins under the bus, saying that she admires the male cousins bc of how close they are. And that the female cousins need to do better. Since I was the only female cousin around, I stood up for us and pointed out that A.) there are 10x more female cousins than male cousins B.) just bc we don’t post every moment together like the male cousins do doesn’t mean we aren’t close and C.) who’s fault is it that she moved her daughter to Florida was she was 5? It just feels rly shady of my cousin who’s visiting to not mention something so important.

4,1cqp92u,AITA for wanting clear communication and boundaries with my roommate,"So my roommate started ""dating"" a girl about 9 months ago. And now she's over all the time! She's over at least 2 times during the work week. And more regularly now sleeping over the whole weekend. He'll ask in the groupchat about her coming over once then not for the rest of the week.  This had been slowly building for the last couple of months.

It really bothers me, but my other roommates don't seem bothered by it like I do. When I've brought it up before he's been passive aggressive and rude about me bringing it up at all. Like I don't think I should be uncomfortable in the place I pay to live just to make them comfortable. I'm stumped on how to bring it up without rocking the boat. It's really effecting my mood since I just stay in my room whenever she's over. I'd love to have clear boundaries in how often she can be here at the house, and know when she's coming over. I hate being surprised by her just suddenly showing up at the front door and walking in. I want to be able to enjoy being in my home again, instead of being a hermit in my room.

  
EDIT:

So for more context, they're not even dating I guess. Overheard them fighting about him wanting to make things official. But she only wants to continue being friends with benefits... I thought they were dating, guess not. 

I have tried getting to know her, I went out with her and my roommates for dinner like 2 months ago. And we got along great all night, we even have a lot in common. But she hasn't talked to me since then. I might get a quite hello and that's it. She talks and laughs with my other roommates fine. 

It's 2 days during the work week. But she's been staying over from Friday night till Sunday night(Monday night if it's a holiday). 

They don't clean up after themselves. Leaving dishes in the sink after the kitchens cleaned. She's obviously over more so she uses the bathroom as well. But he doesn't clean it, but complains it needs to be done. 

He only talks to me when she's not over. Besides that he doesn't say two words to me. 

So, I just don't feel welcome in my own home any more. Which is why I just stay in my room so much. The dynamic has changed drastically and I seem to be the only one bothered.

5,1cqp1oe,AITA for Offering In-Laws an Uber,"My sisters filled me in on this situation and I thought I’d get reddit’s input to see if my parents were actually in the wrong. This involves my mom(52), dad(53), my brother Derek(27), his wife Kiara(24), and Kiara’s parents. 

Kiara’s parents had a connecting flight in the major city close to my parents that they weren’t sure they could make. Kiara and Derek asked my mom and dad if they could pick up her parents so they could stay the night at my parents’ house if they didn’t make the connection. 

The airport is about an hour from our house and the connection was late at night. Not wanting to drive two hours in the middle of the night and then drive two hours in the morning to take them back, my mom and dad suggested that they get an Uber to our house so that everyone would be able to get some sleep. Derek then called my mom and dad and asked them “would you have said that if it were me?” 

Our parents tried to explain their reasoning, but he didn’t listen. 

A couple weeks later, Kiara wanted to come visit my parents and sister. She asked my sister if she would pick her up at the airport. All of her travel communication was through my sister. Then, when she picked her up Kiara said, “thank you for coming to get me. I was worried that if I asked your parents that they would tell me to get an Uber” My sister didn’t say anything to my parents until Kiara left. My mom called Derek and explained to him the comment that Kiara made. She told him that she would always do anything to help him and his wife. Derek then told my mom that Kiara’s parents don’t think my parents are very “warm and friendly.”

Overall this has led to more tension in an already fraught relationship and I’m asking: were my parents assholes for suggesting Kiara’s parents take an Uber?

In 2015, I was placed in state care due to neglect within my family. To summarize, after being forced to come out as bisexual, my legal guardians, my grandparents, reacted by stripping my room bare, believing I was committing a sin with the media I was consuming. When I became cold, they insisted I leave, leading me to move in with my parents next door. Suddenly, a series of family disputes unfolded regarding my parents house, during which my grandparents, leveraging their legal guardianship, demanded I come back to them. Despite my attempts to seek refuge with my parents, the police intervened, forcing me back. In an invasive measure, my legal guardians installed a camera in my room, forbidding any communication with my parents. Eventually I confided in a state worker, ultimately resulting in my removal from their household.

I jumped between hospitals before finding solace in a foster mom, we will call her Angie. Angie is a black southern woman, with such a huge heart. She immediately took me under her wing and popped the bubble I had made around myself. She taught me how to express myself through my art, how to open up, be more assertive, and also helped show my beauty that I previously didn’t see as a depressed teen. Angie has a daughter P and I previously didn’t get along since she was a child and I was a teen. But as P showed me all her ideas (Like baking cake or making slime) and her ambitions, I started to see them as a whole family.

When I returned home a year and a half later, I always noticed that my parents would always speak about Angie negatively. They would be proud that I would “be out of that house.” and “back with the people who know me most.” I ignored it, but always kept in contact with Angie.

Well, now comes to this issue. While I was in foster care, my biological siblings and I didn’t talk since the family drama was poisoning everyone's ears. My grandparents were continually feeding their morals while I was learning new ones of my own. Now as an adult, I only speak to one of my brothers and one of my sisters since the other two want nothing to do with me. We will call them J. 

J and P both go to separate schools and are graduating this year. When I told my family how long I was flying up, and how I planned on staying with Angie instead of my parents, a fight happened. My biological parents and my grandparents are up in arms asking why I would prioritize Angie and P over my “real family.” They were mad at me that I was spending my money to get my own rental car because of previous years having transportation be put over my head and the fact that I was only staying for a couple of days. I told them that I just want to see my siblings graduate and spend the rest of my time relaxing with the few days I have off work.

My mother said that I would be an asshole if I didn’t stay with them and how my little brother would be disappointed that I wasn’t spending time with them.

10,1cqol0c,AITA for bugging my boyfriend over the way he dresses himself?,"Throw away account. My boyfriend (M23) and I (F24) met at a uniform school with a strict uniform code. We have long since graduated but only got together about a year ago. I was admittedly rather startled when I learned how he normally dresses. He isn’t RICH but he is well off and his family is EXTREMELY well off based on their house and cars. I have repeatedly pestered him about the way he dresses and we regularly argue over whether things are normal or acceptable behavior. He dared me to poll reddit this time. So here we are, I will try to stick to the facts.

He does not own pajamas. Nor does he have clothing that he designates as pajamas. He puts on the clothes he intends to wear for the next day and sleeps in those. He argues this is efficient as he then does not have to change when he gets up in the morning. He also points out that one time he showered before bed AND changed the sheets that night so it MUST have been especially fine that night.

He and his father share socks. He claims they are clean since they were washed. There is just a shared bin that both grab socks from.

He wears sneakers, shirts, hoodies, whatever with holes in them because he claims only snooty people will think lesser of him for wearing this stuff. I think he should stop wearing anything that has holes in it outside the house as he looks significantly like a hobo some days. A clean shaven, nice hair cut, hobo.

ALL of his shirts are free shirts from companies or those “i love nyc” type destination shirts. I have asked on multiple occasions about at least a plain shirt with nothing printed on it, he argues there is no difference between that and a shirt with a really small logo (like YMCA) thats easy to hide with a hoodie

TLDR: My boyfriend shares his socks, sleeps in his clothes, and refuses to replace or stop wearing items with holes, he does not own nice clothes. I pester him about it. He is NOT poor. AITA for bugging him to get sleep ware, stop sharing socks, and wear clothes without holes and maybe buy a few shirts without company logos while he is at it?

  
edit1: someone asked so… he does have a tux for weddings. But when I get dressed up for date night her wears the “small logo” shirt and least holey hoodie. Which struck me as inappropriate. Also a second question that was asked was have I tried buying him some stuff. I did buy him new shoes and new hoodies. He wears the shoes when I ask so Im not sure he likes them. He lost the hoodies. I thought they were comfy and I got a few for myself… I guess not to him?

I told her that I spend my hard earned money on their clothes shoes etc. and that it’s unfair to me, to give her the clothes I do want to keep because she won’t keep them in the same condition as I do.

so for context my fam is going to my cousins grad out of state, but we chose to go to a neighboring state because he lives in a more rural area and we would just train there for graduation and then hang out in the more populated city.

our options were between nyc and boston and we went with nyc.

so the other day i was talking w my sister casually and i asked why we didnt go to boston instead bc it would be easier (we have our grandma traveling with us). she says because she wanted to (she was the main planner), and i said ""thats you though, why didnt you make it a solo trip"" and she got really upset and told me to get out of her face right now and why do i always shit on her.

later she showed me messages between my cousin and her planning for the trip and she was yelling at me about how im selfish, self absorbed, and that she didnt do anything to me, that i disrespected her, that i hangout with my friends and ignore family, etc.

i felt rly bad and started reflecting of the things i did wrong. i didnt mean to imply she was selfish for choosing nyc, i only said that because thats how i interpreted what she said, so i understand that and i didnt help plan so it makes sense that i shouldnt rly have a say. she wasnt wrong when talking about how ive been distant from my family, its just been gradually me hanging out less and less with them, which i do feel bad about, so i guess thats another thing. as for the shitting on her, i did make a comment abt her insta page once as kinda like a joke, which she didnt like, which i understand why it was mean, but she mentioned that it was a pattern and that i was also entitled.

So this morning I gave my mom two boxes of sour patch kids because I know those are her favorite candy’s. I gave her a kiss and told her happy Mother’s Day. Later on in the day I got hungry and saw that I had $26 so I thought I’d order something to eat because I don’t have a license to just go drive and get food. I had ended up ordering McDonald’s and I had been charged about $17 leaving me with $9. Later on at dinner I still had my drink from earlier and my mom noticed it she had asked me when I had gotten it and I said I got it today. She got upset and asked why I didn’t get her anything and I had explained that I had bought her the sour patch kids with my own money which is why I had $26 left in my account. My dad chimed in and said that I could’ve gotten her something small even if I had $26 dollars left then he started telling me that I only have one mother and I shouldn’t be treating her like that. I got angry but kept my thoughts to myself but I really wanted to lash out on my dad because I’m writing this at 6:48 P.M and I was home with my mom all day and he had came home about a hour and a half before this. I was trying to make her day special I gave her something she really liked and he constantly gives her shit she doesn’t want like chocolate when she tries to express she doesn’t want those things. He probably just gave her a card while I got her something she can eat. I know I probably hurt my mom’s feeling by buying myself lunch and not buying food for her.

Update: So I went and spoke to my mom and she said it wasn’t right that I got food for myself and didn’t consider her. I had told her right before I got my food I saw the empty bowl of food she had on her nightstand (the bowl was from today so don’t say it could’ve been from the day before) and she was sleeping at the time. She rolled her eyes at me I then asked her all those times she’s come home with food for herself knowing I’m home and there isn’t any food in the house and I haven’t eaten all day that’s fine but me getting food for myself after she’s already eaten and I gave her favorite snacks wasn’t. She told me to get out of her face so I walked away. I know most of you think I’m an AH so I’ll take the title but I am definitely not apologizing to my mom after what just happened.

As most of you are aware today is Mother’s Day in the US idk when Mother’s Day is in other countries so sorry if anyone who doesn’t live in America is confused. So this morning I gave my mom two boxes of sour patch kids because I know those are her favorite candy’s. I gave her a kiss and told her happy Mother’s Day. Later on in the day I got hungry and saw that I had $26 so I thought I’d order something to eat because I don’t have a license to just go drive and get food. I had ended up ordering McDonald’s and I had been charged about $17 leaving me with $9. Later on at dinner I still had my drink from earlier and my mom noticed it she had asked me when I had gotten it and I said I got it today. She got upset and asked why I didn’t get her anything and I had explained that I had bought her the sour patch kids with my own money which is why I had $26 left in my account. My dad chimed in and said that I could’ve gotten her something small even if I had $26 dollars left then he started telling me that I only have one mother and I shouldn’t be treating her like that. I got angry but kept my thoughts to myself but I really wanted to lash out on my dad because I’m writing this at 6:48 P.M and I was home with my mom all day and he had came home about a hour and a half before this. I was trying to make her day special I gave her something she really liked and he constantly gives her shit she doesn’t want like chocolate when she tries to express she doesn’t want those things. He probably just gave her a card while I got her something she can eat. I know I probably hurt my mom’s feeling by buying myself lunch and not buying food for her.

19,1cqnrth,AITA for letting my half sisters call me and my fiancé mommy and daddy?,"So, 6 years ago my dad (50) married Amber (30). Amber and I (23f) got along okay but I always felt she was a little too pushy on being my new mom. They had 2 kids together (5f and 3f) and separated shortly after 3f was born because he was cheating. They got back together 2 years later for a couple months and in that time she got pregnant. My dad also decided that this time he doesn't want anything to do with his kids. 

Amber went into labor 10 months ago and asked me and my fiancé (25m) to take the girls for a few days. Amber had a traumatic birth and post partum depression which then turned into alcoholism. My fiancé and I have custody of all 3 girls and honestly it doesn't seem like either of their parents will be getting them back. Last I heard, Amber is on drugs now and my dad doesn't want anything to do with them beyond sending child support. 

I still take the girls to see Amber's family occasionally and yesterday all 5 of us went to the park so the girls can see their auntie and cousins. While we were there our 3 year old fell and my 5 year old ran to us yelling ""mommy Chloe fell"". I got Chloe, checked out her knee, and told her to sit with daddy so I can get band aids and fruit snacks out of the car. When I got back Amber's sister asked if I really let them call us mommy and daddy. I said yes. As of now it doesn't look like Amber will be getting the kids back and my dad already told me he's ready to sign his rights away so we can adopt the girls. It's not exactly something we encouraged but by the time they started it was already pretty clear that Amber was not going to get clean/sober anytime soon and even if she does she likely won't be mentally stable enough to be a single mom to 3 kids. 

We ended up leaving the park early because I did not want the kids to hear us argue but she's been texting me saying how wrong we are and how heartbroken amber is that we're stealing her kids.

20,1cqn769,AITA for thinking that my boyfriend thought my houseplant was meant to be planted outside,"The title might be a bit misleading, but I wasn't sure how else to phrase it. My boyfriend and I recently had what could be described as the most ridiculous argument we've ever had, and now we're not speaking.

I replied, ""I was planning to let it root a bit more and then pot it. It's a houseplant."" (No negative tone whatsoever) He retorted, ""Yeah, I know it's a houseplant.

He said that he was offended I thought he didn't know it was a houseplant, insisting that I apologize properly and “say that I know he's smart enough to recognize a houseplant” I reiterated my apology, but he felt it wasn't genuine because I was making excuses (referring to me saying the “in the ground” part just confused me) 

I tried to clarify that I wasn't making excuses but was trying to provide some context for my misunderstanding. I also mentioned that him asking me to “say that I know he is smart enough to know that’s a houseplant” felt condescending and rubbed me the wrong way.

21,1cqn690,AITA for getting upset because my boyfriend prioritises his friends over me?,"So me (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) has been together for over 7 years. We live together, and has been for the last 4 years. I will say our relationship is healthy in most aspects, but the one thing that bothers me is that he often chooses his friends over me. 

So I am a student, but work some afternoons and weekends. He works monday too friday, and is free in the weekend. This lead to little to non existent time for us. I feel like we don’t have enough time together, but he disagrees. He thinks that living together equals time together, and when we both are home we are “together”.

The problem is that EVERY day when he comes home from work, he starts gaming with his friends. (Relevant: most of his friends doesn’t live close to us anymore, so this is a way for him to talk with them). But he games until he has to go to bed, and by that time he’s to tired to do anything with me. In the weekend’s he will get up early to game with them. I think it’s ok when I have work, but when I come home he still wants to game with them. When I tell him I want to spend time together, he always tells me he hasn’t seen his friends, and this is the only way for him to have contact. And we are together all the time. So I feel bad for wanting to be with him. This often leads to me getting mad at him for prioritizing the game.

I have suggested that we can work out in the gym since we both train, but he doesn't want to - as he would rather train with his friends. I understand that he thinks it’s better, but this is one of my suggestions for getting “time” together. 

He will often say no to my suggestion on things too do, and never any suggestion from his side. If we go for a walk, we go until he can't be bothered anymore, and if we watch a movie we have to stop when he’s tired of it. He doesn’t see his friends often (talk everyday tho), but he always down for everything with them any time.

Despite the fact that we have been together for so long, we have never been on a proper holiday, simply because work or study has gotten in the way of one or the other. But on the one occasion that suited both of us, he chooses to rather go on holiday with his friends. This was in fact a trip where all his buddies were going to bring their girlfriends, but he didn't seem very excited about having me along. In fact he didn’t mention that his friends was going to bring their girl until one of them told me. I didnt want to go then, and we had a lot of fights because I always feel like he doesn’t prioritize me. 

This is really just some of the things that comes to my mind. I constantly feel like the last priority. And he constantly promises that he will prioritize me, but as soon as something happens, I am the last choice. He is terrible at making plans with me, and expects me to make the suggestions every time. This makes me easily irritated with him, and actually leads to me being sad every time he has to do something with others, as he never has time for me. 

So am I wrong for being sad because he wants to be with his friends? Any suggestions on what to do?

22,1cqmpgm,AITA : My mum and her bf have sex the same night I come home,"So my mum (f36) and her boyfriend (m29) always somehow manage to have sex the same night I (f18) come home from my dad’s. It is literally every. Single. Time. 

Tonight I came back after being at my dad’s for 5 days and once again the start fucking right as I’m about to go to sleep. It’s honestly starting to feel like they are doing it on purpose and it’s driving me mad because I don’t have a way to block out the noise (they are extremely vocal.)I don’t own headphones or anything (which my mum knows) and I can’t afford to buy any since I have rent and food bills and random stuff to not die.

The one time I said something and asked them to maybe try to be a little bit quieter, my mum screamed at me from her room, finished with what they were doing and then came into my room to scream at me at 2:30am. She called me rude for interrupting them (which is fair tbh, but I was trying to sleep and they were both aware of that). When I asked them to be a little quieter I knocked on their partially open door (I didn’t look into the room because ew) and asked them to not moan loud enough to wake up the whole street(but a lot more polite)
I was upset about that because at this point I had to get up in two and a half hours to go to work. She started calling me ungrateful since they let me live in the house (as if I don’t give her money for that exact reason) and that they could be doing it a lot more than they do.

I feel like this probably bothers me more than it should but I don’t know.

Was I the asshole for saying something? Did I overreact?



Edit - I am English

        - I am trying to save up for headphones or earphones, but at the moment I genuinely can’t afford to spend money on some without having to starve for a week.
I can’t leave the house as it’s around 2am and I can’t watch tv or anything because that would be too loud and lead to me being shouted at and my mum threatening to kick me out (sometimes actually making me leave the house for the night and not letting me take a minute to get a bag)

- no, they do not fuck every night, I’m awake until around 3am on nights when I’m working the late shift (2pm-10pm), which is most nights.

25,1cqmg0u,WIBTA if I had a memorial for my neighbour? ,"My (32M) elderly neighbour (97M) died 2 weeks ago and its really upset me. I've lived in the same flat with him (his name was David) as my next door neighbour since I was 19 so he's felt like a permanent fixture of my adult life. David was incredibly sharp even in his later years, great memory even short term memory, still very capable of living alone. I did some things for him like a big shop and coming round for a cup of tea and occasionally cooking + baking for him. During lockdown I lived alone and chatting with David was what got me through the loneliness and craziness of it all, David was a retired doctor and always had great insight and had loads of great stories. Sorry to go off on a tangent about David I just wanted to share how special he was and important to me to contextualise the story. 

I contacted David's nephew through Facebook, I've never met David's nephew as they weren't close but David had no kids or other living family, just to ask about whether there was going to be a funeral (I know David didn't have many living friends but he had a few people in his life). The nephew said no so I thought I'd throw something at my flat just a memorial and I asked around some of the people at the groups David attended to gauge interest. When I'd sorted it I contacted the nephew to invite him, no pressure just I wanted to talk about David and share some of his stories, obviously I didn't have his body or anything I just wanted to celebrate his life with the people that knew him. 

The nephew got back to me very quickly and said it would actually be incredibly weird for me as someone not related to David or a proper friend of his to throw him a memorial service because I was being very invasive and disrespectful to his family and that he'd never met me so it would be weird. Also that id be overstepping. He asked me to cancel but I'm in 2 minds about it, I don't want to disrespect David or overstep and although I know a lot about his past I realise I didn't know much about his present and family relationships but also David was important to me too and I have 5 or 6 local acquaintances of his interested. Also I only arranged it because the nephew said they weren't doing anything.

I've lived in the same flat with him (his name was David) as my next door neighbour since I was 19 so he's felt like a permanent fixture of my adult life. David was incredibly sharp even in his later years, great memory even short term memory, still very capable of living alone. I did some things for him like a big shop and coming round for a cup of tea and occasionally cooking + baking for him. During lockdown I lived alone and chatting with David was what got me through the loneliness and craziness of it all, David was a retired doctor and always had great insight and had loads of great stories. Sorry to go off on a tangent about David I just wanted to share how special he was and important to me to contextualise the story. 

I contacted David's nephew through Facebook, I've never met David's nephew as they weren't close but David had no kids or other living family, just to ask about whether there was going to be a funeral (I know David didn't have many living friends but he had a few people in his life). The nephew said no so I thought I'd throw something at my flat just a memorial and I asked around some of the people at the groups David attended to gauge interest. When I'd sorted it I contacted the nephew to invite him, no pressure just I wanted to talk about David and share some of his stories, obviously I didn't have his body or anything I just wanted to celebrate his life with the people that knew him. 

The nephew got back to me very quickly and said it would actually be incredibly weird for me as someone not related to David or a proper friend of his to throw him a memorial service because I was being very invasive and disrespectful to his family and that he'd never met me so it would be weird. Also that id be overstepping. He asked me to cancel but I'm in 2 minds about it, I don't want to disrespect David or overstep and although I know a lot about his past I realise I didn't know much about his present and family relationships but also David was important to me too and I have 5 or 6 local acquaintances of his interested. Also I only arranged it because the nephew said they weren't doing anything. 

so WIBTA?

26,1cqmcbm,AITA for fighting with my mom on mothers day and making her cry?,"Happy Mother's Day to all of you. I sincerely hope that you had a better one that I did. 

  
I went to celebrate Mother's Day with my family at their house today and had a fun evening of dinner and a movie planned. But before that, a quick family grocery store run to get us ready for the week since it's Sunday today. 

Things went south fast when my mom started venting to me about her incoming divorce with my dad during the trip. I got very triggered when she was sharing her revenge fantasies about my dad, saying how he will come back after the divorce when he has nothing and beg for her help. To which of course, she will deny him. 

  
I called her out on this and told her that she has a pattern of wanting to see people trampled and defeated for her satisfaction (i.e. when I moved out to my first apartment, she told me I'd be back at her house homesick and she will turn me away). 

I told her that never happens! To which she interjected that we do all come back and ask for favors from her (i.e. having packages mailed to her home, doing laundry, etc.) Which sucks to hear that she sees it that way because I thought this was what family does? I also help her with things like her divorce paperwork, babysitting my brother, giving her rides, filling out her insurance forms and income taxes, etc. Then she tells me to just stop talking about the subject. She just wants to enjoy her day and not think about the divorce or anything. So I kept quiet. 

Believe it or not, that wasn't the straw that broke the camels back. My sister ended up also coming to visit her and then telling me how my mom gave her attitude instantly. Before my sister even had a chance to tell her hello. 

And so I told my sister what happened in the car with my mom while we were sitting on the couch. When my mom got wind of me talking to my sister, all hell broke loose. She told me I was a liar for telling my sister that her and I ""fought"" in the car and that she didn't want to go anywhere with me today and stormed off to her room. I said ""okay, I'm leaving. goodbye."" and left without saying another word. 

Then my sister calls to tell me that my mom and my brother are crying at home. 

  
AITA? I feel bad that she is crying on mother's day but I really don't feel bad about leaving. I don't want to sit through her yelling at me in my face. I'd rather go home and be alone in the quiet. I hope that by leaving, my mom gets the message that she can't just yell and scream at me any kind of way and I'll just be there to take it. Her shrieking has a way of piercing my mind and making me feel enraged. I preferred to remove myself from the situation instead of continuing to argue with her like I did in the car. I usually would have a guilt trip but tbh...I don't feel guilty. I feel I took the high road.

I need to know if I'm being an AH here for getting pissed that my GF called her ex to pick her up from a work function on Friday. So I knew about this work function Friday, and I had figured she would have a few drinks. This is usually the case, as they get together about once a month and she will have a few drinks and need a ride home. I don't have any issues with this. This has never been a problem. However this last Friday, it was almost 10pm and she text me ""Hey"" and then called me and didn't leave a message. I was in the shower getting myself ready for bed, (We don't live together) anyway, I get out of the shower and go check my phone. It had been 12 mins since she had called. So I called her back, and she answers and tells me don't worry about the call she needed a ride home and since I didn't answer she called her Ex and he is coming to pick her up. This is where I got upset.

For some backstory, this guy has been nothing but problems. He has gas lighted the F out of her in the past, caused a ton of problems with their kid, yes (They have a 14 y/o together) he doesn't pay any child support and the kid lives with her full time. The kid has had some problems with drugs as well, and we found out that he had purchased drugs for the kid and she (GF) never did anything about it just let it slide. She is always making excuses for his behavior and this has continued for the entire 2 years we were together.

Back to the phone call, I told her I am close to where she is now. Just call him back and tell him I will pick her up. She proceeds to tell me no, that I should have answered and that she already told him he could pick her up. I'm going to try and quote myself here ""Are you being serious right now? You're telling me you in a span of 10 mins you couldn't get ahold of me you called Ex and now you're unwilling to tell him never mind? You ended up getting a ride?
