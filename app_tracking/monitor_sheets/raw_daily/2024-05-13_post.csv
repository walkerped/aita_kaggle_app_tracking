0,1cr97yo,AITA for spending all my time w my bf instead of my stepdad on vacation?,"It's been a bit since this happened, but it's still got me a bit pressed. At the time, I was 17 FTM, with my boyfriend 19 FTM. For my senior year of highschool, I really wanted to go on a trip, and since my family gave my sister 2000 for her graduation gift, I was given that amount too. 

I decided I wanted to go to Japan, where my boyfriend was currently spending a gap year with extended family. I've always wanted to see Japan, and me and my boyfriend had been long distance for almost 2 years, so I let my stepdad, 42 M, know. I used the graduation money for both plane tickets, and had to save up my own money for literally everything else. Since I was underage, my stepdad had to go with me. He refused to plan any of the trip, leaving everything up to me including stuff like passports itenary and hotels etc. He told me not to plan anything for him since it was my trip.

However, when we got there, all my stepdad did was complain. He didn't like that we weren't doing basic tourism things, and that I was doing stuff we could ""do in America."" Tourism isn't really my thing, and I like to experience the culture in more simple ways. He didn't care how happy I was or how I was spending my time, and often stopped activities I had planned. He also disliked my bf, and said he was too cocky, spoiled, and controlling (for simply giving directions and instructions). 

Eventually, my step dad blew up at my bf for giving directions at the zoo, screaming in front of crowds of people and my bfs cousin, 6 M. My bf yelled at him, saying it ""wasn't just his trip"" before my dad grabbed me and stormed off from our ride home. He called my mother to insult my boyfriend while screaming at me for crying, and claimed I was spending too much time with my bf. After finally making it back, he refused to let me see or text my bf, kicking him out of the hotel his mother paid for. 

He then began to purposefully misgender and deadname my bf when he found out. We were allowed one single date together for a few hours, before we could never see each other again. He changed all my plans and made almost everyhting about what he wanted to do. My stepdad claimed that the trip was so much better, and that my bf never should have come. 

I was numb for the rest of the trip and had to fake it till I made it back home. He still hates my bf all because of it, and hates that im still dating him and side with him. All of it (along with other things) lead me to leave the house, and he is absolutely furious. Am I really in the wrong for thinking my stepdad was an asshole?

2,1cr46ep,WIBTAH for not telling my parents in law about my gender reassignment surgery?,"I (24ftm) have top surgery coming soon. I have told very few people about it because it's my decision, my body and I hate people's uncomfortable comments. They always ask intrusive questions or try to talk me out of it. Everything is already booked. There's no turning back for me and it's what I want. 

My boyfriend (24m) is very supportive and loving. He is very close to his family and wants them to know about this big milestone in my life. His parents already know I'm trans but they're weird about it. They accept it, but they pry. They also really dislike me because of my ""off putting personality"". They dislike how shy and meek I am. They think it's creepy how I always offer to help them clean when they host me. I don't know how to act around them.

I don't want to tell them about the surgery. I rather just keep it private. Only my boyfriend and my family will know. I haven't told many friends. Only other queer people because they don't ask intrusive questions like straight people do. They understand how uncomfortable it is. Just cause I want my boobs gone doesn't mean I want you to ask me about my V. 

Despite this, I know it'll make them angry that I didn't tell them once they notice the change. I don't get shirtless ever but what if I randomly do one day? It'll be found out eventually. I might as well be the first to say it. I just don't want too. 

Anyways. Would I be the ass hole for keeping it private?

I come from a big family, and all the cousins are very close, but we have our own tight knit groups due to being raised in close proximity and also age/gender. She moved to Florida when she was 5 so she nvr got to solidify that connection, but when she comes around we make an effort to take her out and catch up. Yesterday we took her to the city, hung out and talked all day. Today I find out through my older male cousins that she’s planning on getting married next year, here in our hometown. She’s even looking at venues and everything. She never mentioned that at all. It irritated me to find out this way because just last December, I got into a big family argument because her mom threw the female cousins under the bus, saying that she admires the male cousins bc of how close they are. And that the female cousins need to do better. Since I was the only female cousin around, I stood up for us and pointed out that A.) there are 10x more female cousins than male cousins B.) just bc we don’t post every moment together like the male cousins do doesn’t mean we aren’t close and C.) who’s fault is it that she moved her daughter to Florida was she was 5? It just feels rly shady of my cousin who’s visiting to not mention something so important.

4,1cqp92u,AITA for wanting clear communication and boundaries with my roommate,"So my roommate started ""dating"" a girl about 9 months ago. And now she's over all the time! She's over at least 2 times during the work week. And more regularly now sleeping over the whole weekend. He'll ask in the groupchat about her coming over once then not for the rest of the week.  This had been slowly building for the last couple of months.

It really bothers me, but my other roommates don't seem bothered by it like I do. When I've brought it up before he's been passive aggressive and rude about me bringing it up at all. Like I don't think I should be uncomfortable in the place I pay to live just to make them comfortable. I'm stumped on how to bring it up without rocking the boat. It's really effecting my mood since I just stay in my room whenever she's over. I'd love to have clear boundaries in how often she can be here at the house, and know when she's coming over. I hate being surprised by her just suddenly showing up at the front door and walking in. I want to be able to enjoy being in my home again, instead of being a hermit in my room.

  
EDIT:

So for more context, they're not even dating I guess. Overheard them fighting about him wanting to make things official. But she only wants to continue being friends with benefits... I thought they were dating, guess not. 

I have tried getting to know her, I went out with her and my roommates for dinner like 2 months ago. And we got along great all night, we even have a lot in common. But she hasn't talked to me since then. I might get a quite hello and that's it. She talks and laughs with my other roommates fine. 

It's 2 days during the work week. But she's been staying over from Friday night till Sunday night(Monday night if it's a holiday). 

They don't clean up after themselves. Leaving dishes in the sink after the kitchens cleaned. She's obviously over more so she uses the bathroom as well. But he doesn't clean it, but complains it needs to be done. 

He only talks to me when she's not over. Besides that he doesn't say two words to me. 

So, I just don't feel welcome in my own home any more. Which is why I just stay in my room so much. The dynamic has changed drastically and I seem to be the only one bothered.

5,1cqp1oe,AITA for Offering In-Laws an Uber,"My sisters filled me in on this situation and I thought I’d get reddit’s input to see if my parents were actually in the wrong. This involves my mom(52), dad(53), my brother Derek(27), his wife Kiara(24), and Kiara’s parents. 

Kiara’s parents had a connecting flight in the major city close to my parents that they weren’t sure they could make. Kiara and Derek asked my mom and dad if they could pick up her parents so they could stay the night at my parents’ house if they didn’t make the connection. 

The airport is about an hour from our house and the connection was late at night. Not wanting to drive two hours in the middle of the night and then drive two hours in the morning to take them back, my mom and dad suggested that they get an Uber to our house so that everyone would be able to get some sleep. Derek then called my mom and dad and asked them “would you have said that if it were me?” 

Our parents tried to explain their reasoning, but he didn’t listen. 

A couple weeks later, Kiara wanted to come visit my parents and sister. She asked my sister if she would pick her up at the airport. All of her travel communication was through my sister. Then, when she picked her up Kiara said, “thank you for coming to get me. I was worried that if I asked your parents that they would tell me to get an Uber” My sister didn’t say anything to my parents until Kiara left. My mom called Derek and explained to him the comment that Kiara made. She told him that she would always do anything to help him and his wife. Derek then told my mom that Kiara’s parents don’t think my parents are very “warm and friendly.”

Overall this has led to more tension in an already fraught relationship and I’m asking: were my parents assholes for suggesting Kiara’s parents take an Uber?

In 2015, I was placed in state care due to neglect within my family. To summarize, after being forced to come out as bisexual, my legal guardians, my grandparents, reacted by stripping my room bare, believing I was committing a sin with the media I was consuming. When I became cold, they insisted I leave, leading me to move in with my parents next door. Suddenly, a series of family disputes unfolded regarding my parents house, during which my grandparents, leveraging their legal guardianship, demanded I come back to them. Despite my attempts to seek refuge with my parents, the police intervened, forcing me back. In an invasive measure, my legal guardians installed a camera in my room, forbidding any communication with my parents. Eventually I confided in a state worker, ultimately resulting in my removal from their household.

I jumped between hospitals before finding solace in a foster mom, we will call her Angie. Angie is a black southern woman, with such a huge heart. She immediately took me under her wing and popped the bubble I had made around myself. She taught me how to express myself through my art, how to open up, be more assertive, and also helped show my beauty that I previously didn’t see as a depressed teen. Angie has a daughter P and I previously didn’t get along since she was a child and I was a teen. But as P showed me all her ideas (Like baking cake or making slime) and her ambitions, I started to see them as a whole family.

When I returned home a year and a half later, I always noticed that my parents would always speak about Angie negatively. They would be proud that I would “be out of that house.” and “back with the people who know me most.” I ignored it, but always kept in contact with Angie.

Well, now comes to this issue. While I was in foster care, my biological siblings and I didn’t talk since the family drama was poisoning everyone's ears. My grandparents were continually feeding their morals while I was learning new ones of my own. Now as an adult, I only speak to one of my brothers and one of my sisters since the other two want nothing to do with me. We will call them J. 

J and P both go to separate schools and are graduating this year. When I told my family how long I was flying up, and how I planned on staying with Angie instead of my parents, a fight happened. My biological parents and my grandparents are up in arms asking why I would prioritize Angie and P over my “real family.” They were mad at me that I was spending my money to get my own rental car because of previous years having transportation be put over my head and the fact that I was only staying for a couple of days. I told them that I just want to see my siblings graduate and spend the rest of my time relaxing with the few days I have off work.

My mother said that I would be an asshole if I didn’t stay with them and how my little brother would be disappointed that I wasn’t spending time with them.

10,1cqol0c,AITA for bugging my boyfriend over the way he dresses himself?,"Throw away account. My boyfriend (M23) and I (F24) met at a uniform school with a strict uniform code. We have long since graduated but only got together about a year ago. I was admittedly rather startled when I learned how he normally dresses. He isn’t RICH but he is well off and his family is EXTREMELY well off based on their house and cars. I have repeatedly pestered him about the way he dresses and we regularly argue over whether things are normal or acceptable behavior. He dared me to poll reddit this time. So here we are, I will try to stick to the facts.

He does not own pajamas. Nor does he have clothing that he designates as pajamas. He puts on the clothes he intends to wear for the next day and sleeps in those. He argues this is efficient as he then does not have to change when he gets up in the morning. He also points out that one time he showered before bed AND changed the sheets that night so it MUST have been especially fine that night.

He and his father share socks. He claims they are clean since they were washed. There is just a shared bin that both grab socks from.

He wears sneakers, shirts, hoodies, whatever with holes in them because he claims only snooty people will think lesser of him for wearing this stuff. I think he should stop wearing anything that has holes in it outside the house as he looks significantly like a hobo some days. A clean shaven, nice hair cut, hobo.

ALL of his shirts are free shirts from companies or those “i love nyc” type destination shirts. I have asked on multiple occasions about at least a plain shirt with nothing printed on it, he argues there is no difference between that and a shirt with a really small logo (like YMCA) thats easy to hide with a hoodie

TLDR: My boyfriend shares his socks, sleeps in his clothes, and refuses to replace or stop wearing items with holes, he does not own nice clothes. I pester him about it. He is NOT poor. AITA for bugging him to get sleep ware, stop sharing socks, and wear clothes without holes and maybe buy a few shirts without company logos while he is at it?

  
edit1: someone asked so… he does have a tux for weddings. But when I get dressed up for date night her wears the “small logo” shirt and least holey hoodie. Which struck me as inappropriate. Also a second question that was asked was have I tried buying him some stuff. I did buy him new shoes and new hoodies. He wears the shoes when I ask so Im not sure he likes them. He lost the hoodies. I thought they were comfy and I got a few for myself… I guess not to him?

I told her that I spend my hard earned money on their clothes shoes etc. and that it’s unfair to me, to give her the clothes I do want to keep because she won’t keep them in the same condition as I do.

so for context my fam is going to my cousins grad out of state, but we chose to go to a neighboring state because he lives in a more rural area and we would just train there for graduation and then hang out in the more populated city.

our options were between nyc and boston and we went with nyc.

so the other day i was talking w my sister casually and i asked why we didnt go to boston instead bc it would be easier (we have our grandma traveling with us). she says because she wanted to (she was the main planner), and i said ""thats you though, why didnt you make it a solo trip"" and she got really upset and told me to get out of her face right now and why do i always shit on her.

later she showed me messages between my cousin and her planning for the trip and she was yelling at me about how im selfish, self absorbed, and that she didnt do anything to me, that i disrespected her, that i hangout with my friends and ignore family, etc.

i felt rly bad and started reflecting of the things i did wrong. i didnt mean to imply she was selfish for choosing nyc, i only said that because thats how i interpreted what she said, so i understand that and i didnt help plan so it makes sense that i shouldnt rly have a say. she wasnt wrong when talking about how ive been distant from my family, its just been gradually me hanging out less and less with them, which i do feel bad about, so i guess thats another thing. as for the shitting on her, i did make a comment abt her insta page once as kinda like a joke, which she didnt like, which i understand why it was mean, but she mentioned that it was a pattern and that i was also entitled.

So this morning I gave my mom two boxes of sour patch kids because I know those are her favorite candy’s. I gave her a kiss and told her happy Mother’s Day. Later on in the day I got hungry and saw that I had $26 so I thought I’d order something to eat because I don’t have a license to just go drive and get food. I had ended up ordering McDonald’s and I had been charged about $17 leaving me with $9. Later on at dinner I still had my drink from earlier and my mom noticed it she had asked me when I had gotten it and I said I got it today. She got upset and asked why I didn’t get her anything and I had explained that I had bought her the sour patch kids with my own money which is why I had $26 left in my account. My dad chimed in and said that I could’ve gotten her something small even if I had $26 dollars left then he started telling me that I only have one mother and I shouldn’t be treating her like that. I got angry but kept my thoughts to myself but I really wanted to lash out on my dad because I’m writing this at 6:48 P.M and I was home with my mom all day and he had came home about a hour and a half before this. I was trying to make her day special I gave her something she really liked and he constantly gives her shit she doesn’t want like chocolate when she tries to express she doesn’t want those things. He probably just gave her a card while I got her something she can eat. I know I probably hurt my mom’s feeling by buying myself lunch and not buying food for her.

Update: So I went and spoke to my mom and she said it wasn’t right that I got food for myself and didn’t consider her. I had told her right before I got my food I saw the empty bowl of food she had on her nightstand (the bowl was from today so don’t say it could’ve been from the day before) and she was sleeping at the time. She rolled her eyes at me I then asked her all those times she’s come home with food for herself knowing I’m home and there isn’t any food in the house and I haven’t eaten all day that’s fine but me getting food for myself after she’s already eaten and I gave her favorite snacks wasn’t. She told me to get out of her face so I walked away. I know most of you think I’m an AH so I’ll take the title but I am definitely not apologizing to my mom after what just happened.

As most of you are aware today is Mother’s Day in the US idk when Mother’s Day is in other countries so sorry if anyone who doesn’t live in America is confused. So this morning I gave my mom two boxes of sour patch kids because I know those are her favorite candy’s. I gave her a kiss and told her happy Mother’s Day. Later on in the day I got hungry and saw that I had $26 so I thought I’d order something to eat because I don’t have a license to just go drive and get food. I had ended up ordering McDonald’s and I had been charged about $17 leaving me with $9. Later on at dinner I still had my drink from earlier and my mom noticed it she had asked me when I had gotten it and I said I got it today. She got upset and asked why I didn’t get her anything and I had explained that I had bought her the sour patch kids with my own money which is why I had $26 left in my account. My dad chimed in and said that I could’ve gotten her something small even if I had $26 dollars left then he started telling me that I only have one mother and I shouldn’t be treating her like that. I got angry but kept my thoughts to myself but I really wanted to lash out on my dad because I’m writing this at 6:48 P.M and I was home with my mom all day and he had came home about a hour and a half before this. I was trying to make her day special I gave her something she really liked and he constantly gives her shit she doesn’t want like chocolate when she tries to express she doesn’t want those things. He probably just gave her a card while I got her something she can eat. I know I probably hurt my mom’s feeling by buying myself lunch and not buying food for her.

19,1cqnrth,AITA for letting my half sisters call me and my fiancé mommy and daddy?,"So, 6 years ago my dad (50) married Amber (30). Amber and I (23f) got along okay but I always felt she was a little too pushy on being my new mom. They had 2 kids together (5f and 3f) and separated shortly after 3f was born because he was cheating. They got back together 2 years later for a couple months and in that time she got pregnant. My dad also decided that this time he doesn't want anything to do with his kids. 

Amber went into labor 10 months ago and asked me and my fiancé (25m) to take the girls for a few days. Amber had a traumatic birth and post partum depression which then turned into alcoholism. My fiancé and I have custody of all 3 girls and honestly it doesn't seem like either of their parents will be getting them back. Last I heard, Amber is on drugs now and my dad doesn't want anything to do with them beyond sending child support. 

I still take the girls to see Amber's family occasionally and yesterday all 5 of us went to the park so the girls can see their auntie and cousins. While we were there our 3 year old fell and my 5 year old ran to us yelling ""mommy Chloe fell"". I got Chloe, checked out her knee, and told her to sit with daddy so I can get band aids and fruit snacks out of the car. When I got back Amber's sister asked if I really let them call us mommy and daddy. I said yes. As of now it doesn't look like Amber will be getting the kids back and my dad already told me he's ready to sign his rights away so we can adopt the girls. It's not exactly something we encouraged but by the time they started it was already pretty clear that Amber was not going to get clean/sober anytime soon and even if she does she likely won't be mentally stable enough to be a single mom to 3 kids. 

We ended up leaving the park early because I did not want the kids to hear us argue but she's been texting me saying how wrong we are and how heartbroken amber is that we're stealing her kids.

20,1cqn769,AITA for thinking that my boyfriend thought my houseplant was meant to be planted outside,"The title might be a bit misleading, but I wasn't sure how else to phrase it. My boyfriend and I recently had what could be described as the most ridiculous argument we've ever had, and now we're not speaking.

I replied, ""I was planning to let it root a bit more and then pot it. It's a houseplant."" (No negative tone whatsoever) He retorted, ""Yeah, I know it's a houseplant.

He said that he was offended I thought he didn't know it was a houseplant, insisting that I apologize properly and “say that I know he's smart enough to recognize a houseplant” I reiterated my apology, but he felt it wasn't genuine because I was making excuses (referring to me saying the “in the ground” part just confused me) 

I tried to clarify that I wasn't making excuses but was trying to provide some context for my misunderstanding. I also mentioned that him asking me to “say that I know he is smart enough to know that’s a houseplant” felt condescending and rubbed me the wrong way.

21,1cqn690,AITA for getting upset because my boyfriend prioritises his friends over me?,"So me (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) has been together for over 7 years. We live together, and has been for the last 4 years. I will say our relationship is healthy in most aspects, but the one thing that bothers me is that he often chooses his friends over me. 

So I am a student, but work some afternoons and weekends. He works monday too friday, and is free in the weekend. This lead to little to non existent time for us. I feel like we don’t have enough time together, but he disagrees. He thinks that living together equals time together, and when we both are home we are “together”.

The problem is that EVERY day when he comes home from work, he starts gaming with his friends. (Relevant: most of his friends doesn’t live close to us anymore, so this is a way for him to talk with them). But he games until he has to go to bed, and by that time he’s to tired to do anything with me. In the weekend’s he will get up early to game with them. I think it’s ok when I have work, but when I come home he still wants to game with them. When I tell him I want to spend time together, he always tells me he hasn’t seen his friends, and this is the only way for him to have contact. And we are together all the time. So I feel bad for wanting to be with him. This often leads to me getting mad at him for prioritizing the game.

I have suggested that we can work out in the gym since we both train, but he doesn't want to - as he would rather train with his friends. I understand that he thinks it’s better, but this is one of my suggestions for getting “time” together. 

He will often say no to my suggestion on things too do, and never any suggestion from his side. If we go for a walk, we go until he can't be bothered anymore, and if we watch a movie we have to stop when he’s tired of it. He doesn’t see his friends often (talk everyday tho), but he always down for everything with them any time.

Despite the fact that we have been together for so long, we have never been on a proper holiday, simply because work or study has gotten in the way of one or the other. But on the one occasion that suited both of us, he chooses to rather go on holiday with his friends. This was in fact a trip where all his buddies were going to bring their girlfriends, but he didn't seem very excited about having me along. In fact he didn’t mention that his friends was going to bring their girl until one of them told me. I didnt want to go then, and we had a lot of fights because I always feel like he doesn’t prioritize me. 

This is really just some of the things that comes to my mind. I constantly feel like the last priority. And he constantly promises that he will prioritize me, but as soon as something happens, I am the last choice. He is terrible at making plans with me, and expects me to make the suggestions every time. This makes me easily irritated with him, and actually leads to me being sad every time he has to do something with others, as he never has time for me. 

So am I wrong for being sad because he wants to be with his friends? Any suggestions on what to do?

22,1cqmpgm,AITA : My mum and her bf have sex the same night I come home,"So my mum (f36) and her boyfriend (m29) always somehow manage to have sex the same night I (f18) come home from my dad’s. It is literally every. Single. Time. 

Tonight I came back after being at my dad’s for 5 days and once again the start fucking right as I’m about to go to sleep. It’s honestly starting to feel like they are doing it on purpose and it’s driving me mad because I don’t have a way to block out the noise (they are extremely vocal.)I don’t own headphones or anything (which my mum knows) and I can’t afford to buy any since I have rent and food bills and random stuff to not die.

The one time I said something and asked them to maybe try to be a little bit quieter, my mum screamed at me from her room, finished with what they were doing and then came into my room to scream at me at 2:30am. She called me rude for interrupting them (which is fair tbh, but I was trying to sleep and they were both aware of that). When I asked them to be a little quieter I knocked on their partially open door (I didn’t look into the room because ew) and asked them to not moan loud enough to wake up the whole street(but a lot more polite)
I was upset about that because at this point I had to get up in two and a half hours to go to work. She started calling me ungrateful since they let me live in the house (as if I don’t give her money for that exact reason) and that they could be doing it a lot more than they do.

I feel like this probably bothers me more than it should but I don’t know.

Was I the asshole for saying something? Did I overreact?



Edit - I am English

        - I am trying to save up for headphones or earphones, but at the moment I genuinely can’t afford to spend money on some without having to starve for a week.
I can’t leave the house as it’s around 2am and I can’t watch tv or anything because that would be too loud and lead to me being shouted at and my mum threatening to kick me out (sometimes actually making me leave the house for the night and not letting me take a minute to get a bag)

- no, they do not fuck every night, I’m awake until around 3am on nights when I’m working the late shift (2pm-10pm), which is most nights.

25,1cqmg0u,WIBTA if I had a memorial for my neighbour? ,"My (32M) elderly neighbour (97M) died 2 weeks ago and its really upset me. I've lived in the same flat with him (his name was David) as my next door neighbour since I was 19 so he's felt like a permanent fixture of my adult life. David was incredibly sharp even in his later years, great memory even short term memory, still very capable of living alone. I did some things for him like a big shop and coming round for a cup of tea and occasionally cooking + baking for him. During lockdown I lived alone and chatting with David was what got me through the loneliness and craziness of it all, David was a retired doctor and always had great insight and had loads of great stories. Sorry to go off on a tangent about David I just wanted to share how special he was and important to me to contextualise the story. 

I contacted David's nephew through Facebook, I've never met David's nephew as they weren't close but David had no kids or other living family, just to ask about whether there was going to be a funeral (I know David didn't have many living friends but he had a few people in his life). The nephew said no so I thought I'd throw something at my flat just a memorial and I asked around some of the people at the groups David attended to gauge interest. When I'd sorted it I contacted the nephew to invite him, no pressure just I wanted to talk about David and share some of his stories, obviously I didn't have his body or anything I just wanted to celebrate his life with the people that knew him. 

The nephew got back to me very quickly and said it would actually be incredibly weird for me as someone not related to David or a proper friend of his to throw him a memorial service because I was being very invasive and disrespectful to his family and that he'd never met me so it would be weird. Also that id be overstepping. He asked me to cancel but I'm in 2 minds about it, I don't want to disrespect David or overstep and although I know a lot about his past I realise I didn't know much about his present and family relationships but also David was important to me too and I have 5 or 6 local acquaintances of his interested. Also I only arranged it because the nephew said they weren't doing anything.

I've lived in the same flat with him (his name was David) as my next door neighbour since I was 19 so he's felt like a permanent fixture of my adult life. David was incredibly sharp even in his later years, great memory even short term memory, still very capable of living alone. I did some things for him like a big shop and coming round for a cup of tea and occasionally cooking + baking for him. During lockdown I lived alone and chatting with David was what got me through the loneliness and craziness of it all, David was a retired doctor and always had great insight and had loads of great stories. Sorry to go off on a tangent about David I just wanted to share how special he was and important to me to contextualise the story. 

I contacted David's nephew through Facebook, I've never met David's nephew as they weren't close but David had no kids or other living family, just to ask about whether there was going to be a funeral (I know David didn't have many living friends but he had a few people in his life). The nephew said no so I thought I'd throw something at my flat just a memorial and I asked around some of the people at the groups David attended to gauge interest. When I'd sorted it I contacted the nephew to invite him, no pressure just I wanted to talk about David and share some of his stories, obviously I didn't have his body or anything I just wanted to celebrate his life with the people that knew him. 

The nephew got back to me very quickly and said it would actually be incredibly weird for me as someone not related to David or a proper friend of his to throw him a memorial service because I was being very invasive and disrespectful to his family and that he'd never met me so it would be weird. Also that id be overstepping. He asked me to cancel but I'm in 2 minds about it, I don't want to disrespect David or overstep and although I know a lot about his past I realise I didn't know much about his present and family relationships but also David was important to me too and I have 5 or 6 local acquaintances of his interested. Also I only arranged it because the nephew said they weren't doing anything. 

so WIBTA?

26,1cqmcbm,AITA for fighting with my mom on mothers day and making her cry?,"Happy Mother's Day to all of you. I sincerely hope that you had a better one that I did. 

  
I went to celebrate Mother's Day with my family at their house today and had a fun evening of dinner and a movie planned. But before that, a quick family grocery store run to get us ready for the week since it's Sunday today. 

Things went south fast when my mom started venting to me about her incoming divorce with my dad during the trip. I got very triggered when she was sharing her revenge fantasies about my dad, saying how he will come back after the divorce when he has nothing and beg for her help. To which of course, she will deny him. 

  
I called her out on this and told her that she has a pattern of wanting to see people trampled and defeated for her satisfaction (i.e. when I moved out to my first apartment, she told me I'd be back at her house homesick and she will turn me away). 

I told her that never happens! To which she interjected that we do all come back and ask for favors from her (i.e. having packages mailed to her home, doing laundry, etc.) Which sucks to hear that she sees it that way because I thought this was what family does? I also help her with things like her divorce paperwork, babysitting my brother, giving her rides, filling out her insurance forms and income taxes, etc. Then she tells me to just stop talking about the subject. She just wants to enjoy her day and not think about the divorce or anything. So I kept quiet. 

Believe it or not, that wasn't the straw that broke the camels back. My sister ended up also coming to visit her and then telling me how my mom gave her attitude instantly. Before my sister even had a chance to tell her hello. 

And so I told my sister what happened in the car with my mom while we were sitting on the couch. When my mom got wind of me talking to my sister, all hell broke loose. She told me I was a liar for telling my sister that her and I ""fought"" in the car and that she didn't want to go anywhere with me today and stormed off to her room. I said ""okay, I'm leaving. goodbye."" and left without saying another word. 

Then my sister calls to tell me that my mom and my brother are crying at home. 

  
AITA? I feel bad that she is crying on mother's day but I really don't feel bad about leaving. I don't want to sit through her yelling at me in my face. I'd rather go home and be alone in the quiet. I hope that by leaving, my mom gets the message that she can't just yell and scream at me any kind of way and I'll just be there to take it. Her shrieking has a way of piercing my mind and making me feel enraged. I preferred to remove myself from the situation instead of continuing to argue with her like I did in the car. I usually would have a guilt trip but tbh...I don't feel guilty. I feel I took the high road.

So I knew about this work function Friday, and I had figured she would have a few drinks. This is usually the case, as they get together about once a month and she will have a few drinks and need a ride home. I don't have any issues with this. This has never been a problem. However this last Friday, it was almost 10pm and she text me ""Hey"" and then called me and didn't leave a message. I was in the shower getting myself ready for bed, (We don't live together) anyway, I get out of the shower and go check my phone. It had been 12 mins since she had called. So I called her back, and she answers and tells me don't worry about the call she needed a ride home and since I didn't answer she called her Ex and he is coming to pick her up. This is where I got upset.

For some backstory, this guy has been nothing but problems. He has gas lighted the F out of her in the past, caused a ton of problems with their kid, yes (They have a 14 y/o together) he doesn't pay any child support and the kid lives with her full time. The kid has had some problems with drugs as well, and we found out that he had purchased drugs for the kid and she (GF) never did anything about it just let it slide. She is always making excuses for his behavior and this has continued for the entire 2 years we were together.

She proceeds to tell me no, that I should have answered and that she already told him he could pick her up. I'm going to try and quote myself here ""Are you being serious right now?

My sister and I are opposites.  She is a dog mom (god I hate writing that) to an extreme degree, My wife and I are not dog people.  When she got the invite she reached out and said her, her boyfriend, and 2 dogs (Small 10 pound dogs) would be there.  I was annoyed and called her to tell her no, her dogs are not allowed.  

She asked if kids were going, I said yes, some were.  She said well her dogs are family and they should be able to come.  I told her I don't consider your dogs family.  In fact I think your crazy for thinking that your dogs are my family.  She argued her dogs were just as much family as the kids were.  She said her dogs wanted to see their uncles new backyard.  I told her to shut up and never say that again to me.  I re-affirmed that her and her boyfriend could come, but nothing else from their house.  She got angry but I eventually hung up.  

She didn't go to the party claiming I was rude and an asshole to her.   Apparently my parents even agree with her, which fucking blows my mind.  Heard a rumor she is hosting an event and is seemingly excluding me from the invite list. AITA Here?",0.0,0.9504840970039368,1,0
35,1crdwst,AITA for not helping my fiancé pay his traffic violation?,"My fiancé (M/38) got a speeding ticket a few months ago and used ticket clinic but didn’t follow through and is about to have his license suspended because he didn’t pay the court fees. 

I checked the mail today and there was a traffic violation for running a red light (I should point out that we share the car and it’s under my name). Based on the date/time, he would have been the one driving. He asked me if I would be paying 50/50. I said that I wouldn’t expect him to pay half if I got a ticket. He went nonverbal and walked outside. 

I understand that we are a team but should I be financially responsible for his irresponsibility? Am I crazy or in the wrong here?

36,1crdwl6,AITA for ruining my ex's interview?,"This weekend me and my BF broke up, and the last drop was 1 discussion.
On thursday he had an interview to an area he really wants to get into and has been working really hard to do it. It isn't his dream workplace, but it was kind of a way in. I have always supported him, and cheered him on, so on thursday I did everything I could to help him have a nice day.

I sent him cookies he liked, gave him space to concentrate the entire day, and would only talk to him when he talked to me.
1 hour before his interview, he started arguing with me over how much time I spent on tiktok on my alone time. I am 24, financially stable, have a degree, a good job, live by myself, and care for myself and my 2 cats. 
He is currently unemployed, just picked up his education again and is still not stable. So he has a different life and a different routine.
I tried to defuse the discussion until he actively started insulting my interests and my lifestyle.
30 minutes in (and about 40 minutes before his interview) I let him win, and deleted tiktok. However he was still mean and was still treating me badly.

He told me a few times to shut up, to do whatever I wanted, that he didn't f*ing care and to leave him alone. That was his way of ending the fight to focus on the meeting. I would tell him to not treat me like that, and to not leave me like that after I did nothing wrong and STILL did what he wanted. And he would come back to tell me again that I was wrong.
I just wanted to resolve things, as he would always start fights, get me angry by insulting me, then give me the silent treatment. I was at my wits end, but didn't intend on holding him with me. He could've literally told me without cussing he had to leave, and I would say nothing of it.

We stopped talking 5 minutes before his interview started. He did badly and blamed me because I should've left him alone. But even if the fight had happened, like, 5 hours earlier, he would still blame me, because that's something he has done before.
We broke up already and no one thinks it was my fault because he 1) shouldn't have even started it that close to an event that was important for him, 2) should have put his phone aside when he thought apropriate and only talked to me again once he calmed down and got through the interview, 3) respected that I can do what I want when I'm by myself.

I am feeling like maybe I am wrong here.
So AITA? 

Edit to add: I want to add I was also really sick at this time, with a high fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure and an infection that had spread to my blood. At the time of the argument he knew I was sick, and after I got worse and was taken to the hospital, he didn't really come see me or anything.

37,1crdpvb,WIBTAH if I confronted my coworkers?,"Hi everyone,

I've been struggling with a situation at work and could really use some outside perspective. I've been with my current job for about 7-8 months now, and during that time, I've formed what I thought were good friendships with my coworkers (hung out outside of work, etc) However, recently I found out that they went behind my back and spoke to our supervisor about me being slow(I unpack with my team and sort the contents) without ever discussing it with me first. It's not the first time they talked about me behind my back either since I found as well they talked about me being snippy the past few weeks, and I never realized it. I apologized of course and, I told them again after that, that if there is a problem with me to please come to me. This wouldn't be the first time me telling them to talk to me about problems concerning me either.

Regardless, I'm feeling hurt and confused. I value open communication and honesty in the workplace, and I feel betrayed that they didn't talk to me about it. I never minded criticism where it's needed, that's how I improve with a constantly changing work environment.

I'm considering confronting them about it, but I don't want to come across as rude or make the situation worse. At the same time, I don't want to ignore the issue and let resentment build up. I love my job, but I'll hate if I have to move departments over this.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.

39,1crdi0s,AITA for snapping at my family and essentially ruining Mother’s Day?,"Hi, I’m 23F. Yesterday I broke down in front of my family and basically, I ruined Mother’s Day. I personally feel like I am NOT the asshole but my family thinks otherwise. 

Important context: My mom died 13 years ago. After she died I pretty much took on the ‘mom’ role at 10 years old. I pretty much raised my brothers and became my dad’s emotional support which has become a huge burden for me. 

I can’t go into too much detail but I cook, clean, take my brothers to appointments, I’ve attended parent teacher conferences, etc. I may not be a mother, but I sure as hell acted like one for the last 13 years. 

So, yesterday morning, I expected I’d get a break. A break from cleaning, and cooking, doing the dishes, everything. Maybe this is selfish of me but I expected flowers or something. But no. 

The first thing said to me yesterday morning was “Do this dishes and clean the kitchen.” I was upset but I did it. 

Then later, my dad told me to cook dinner for everyone. That’s when I lost it. I started sobbing in front of my entire family and, yes, I screamed at them. I just let everything that I’ve been holding on for 13 years out. I told my family I was sick of them being unappreciative, and how extremely unloved I felt. My brothers stayed silent as my dad yelled at me and told me how ungrateful I was, and that on Father’s day he doesn’t expect to “sit around and do nothing.” 

I went down to my room sobbing. Nobody came to check on me. Nobody sent a text asking if I was okay. And then, they ate dinner without me.

44,1crcx3n,WIBTA if I confronted a teenager about riding his bike through my yard every day?,"I moved into a new house in a suburban town about 2 years ago. I came here from 20+ years in New York City so I sometimes question my judgement, as in “is this normal in the suburbs and I’m just thinking like an asshole New Yorker?”

The house I bought was previously occupied by an old lady and then sat vacant for about 5 years before I bough it. So the yard was overgrown and it was generally rundown. 

The house is uphill from a high school. Lots of kids cut through our neighborhood yards to and from school, as following the streets would be an indirect and uphill trek. And since my house was quiet & seemingly empty for years, no one thought twice about using our yard as a path. 

When we moved in, we immediately started renovations & repairs. It was visibly obvious a new owner had moved in. The first few weeks, a kid who was cutting through our yard actually rang the doorbell to introduce herself to ask if it was ok to walk through. We appreciated her gesture, of course said yes and it was no big deal, and she has continued to use our yard as a path. She’s respectful and always says hi. 

But this one other teen guy is awful. While the other kids walk, he rides his bike (one of those thick-tire beach dune bikes that shouldn’t even be used on the streets) and zips through our yard at high speed with headphones on. More than once I’ve been in our backyard when he rides through and he doesn’t even acknowledge me. Like, you’re literally in my private backyard and you’re just pretending you don’t see me? And as we’ve improved the property, we now have landscaping, flowers, fresh grass, etc that he just rides over with his bike, tearing it up. But the last straw was when my toddler daughter who is just learning to walk was playing in the backyard and he zipped through and swerved around her, narrowly avoiding hitting her, and again he just ignored us and kept riding. 

I love that we’re in a small community and I’m happy to give kids a safe way to walk home. But this kid is going over the line. Would I be the asshole if I waited for him, flagged him down, and told him to stop riding through our yard? Or if I posted in the town FB group a description of the kid and his unique bike to try to talk to his parents?  

Is this just what happens in small towns and I’m expected to deal with it?

I’m an only child with an average sized family, I wouldn’t say I’m crazy close to any of them though. if I’m being completely honest, I do think there’s trauma when I think about family, especially since my parents are divorce and this divorced caused some divides in my family, with some ppl I haven’t spoken to in years, with one of them hugely betraying my mum and trying to conspire us against each other. however, not only will there be a bunch of his cousins there, there will also be more sets of cousins who I’ve never met before, their partners, a kid, as well as his cousin’s work colleagues and some friends. I said I no longer want to go as there’s a lot of people and I get nervous in large gatherings. it’s overwhelming and I feel like it’s something I would rather reserve for later in the relationship rather than at this point.



he’s told me that he’s upset about the concept of me not going and, even though he said there’s no pressure for me to go to these events, him saying this has definitely made me feel guilty about not wanting to go anymore. a previous time I tried this, he said the same thing and that it’ll now be awkward because he’s already told them that I can go but then I said I couldn’t (my reason for not going to this event was because my own cousin had later invited me to a BBQ and I wanted to go to it as this would’ve been the last time I saw her before she flew out to move to Asia for a year).



I’ve already expressed to my bf that I would feel MUCH more comfortable meeting different people individually/in a smaller group rather than in a huge social setting (I really thrive in more intimate interactions), and he said him and his cousins rarely meet in small groups/solo. idk if I’m being a big baby about this but I feel like my boundaries are being pushed.

Her family has mostly disowned her and she has had it rough with them in many ways to say the least. We met in college 8 years ago, and there was a spark, but she continued to date a guy in his 30s while she was 20 the whole time we were at school. He also treated her incredibly poorly just like her family did. Like I said, she's had it rough. We ended up dating in 2020 but it was really difficult. Sure the pandemic was difficult to deal with but we also lived 350 plus miles from one another. Because of her history she requires a lot of love and attention. I loved being there for her and truly fell in love with her. We named our future kids, planned our lives, it seemed like we found our perfect match. Unfortunately, she began to treat me the way her family did. I would go into details but it's not appropriate.  We ended things in 2021 but still managed to stay best friends. For the past three years, we have lived in a kind of la la state of coming back to each other and then branching off to new people. We do this because I had not been able to let go of our future and I provided the first ever safe place for her to be herself. Fast forward to February this year. We connect again and it feels very real. We are right back into naming kids and also start having phone sex. It all seemed good until about a month and a half ago, she said she went on a date with another guy and wanted to pursue it. That was the final straw for me and I pulled back. I worked on getting over her and I truly believe I have. I am seeing someone else now and I'm very happy. Still, she relies on me. She says I am the only family she has left. Whenever she starts dating a new guy she always tells me that if he makes her choose between him or me that she will always pick me. I have been there for her through everything the past 8 years and she claims she may not still be here with us if I didn't stay her friend. She says I am her tribe. That I am blood.

As regular apartment building people do, everyone respected its presence for 72 hours before someone (presuming it was free & up for grabs) took one of the side tables. 

The next day, whomever owned the furniture wrote a note that said “this is not free, bring back the table that you stole!” which was kinda weird (why is it just sitting in the lobby then?) but whoever took the table returned it. 

About a week later, management caught wind that there was all this furniture in the lobby & texted that they had from Friday until Monday to remove the furniture or it was getting thrown out by management. Sunday night at like 9pm everything was still there so I took a bookshelf. It was pretty obvious to me that nobody was going to actually take the furniture. 

Today, whoever owned it posted a note on the front door saying “TO WHO STOLE THE BOOKSHELF THAT WAS BEING PICKED UP YESTERDAY YOU HAVE UNTIL TONIGHT TO RETURN IT BEFORE I CALL THE COPS AND INFORM THE LANDLORD IT WAS STOLEN. YOU ARE ON CAMERA.”

Ignoring the fact that none of the cameras actually work and that it was abandoned furniture management was going to throw out 12 hours later, I’m still feeling a little guilty.

I have joined a new group of friends and in this group I (24 female) really got along well with one person (31 female), we’ll call her Emma. 

Eventually, Emma told me that she liked me. I told her that I didn’t feel the same way, but I would still like to be friends. I ended up being quite busy after that finishing the semester, visiting family and whatnot. I would still see her on the occasional weekend outings with our other friends. At these hangouts, I was more hesitant with Emma because I wanted to gauge how she felt/give her the space she needed.

It became increasingly clear, every time we were hanging out with friends, that she was avoiding me more and more. At one group hangout (trivia), I arrived late so everyone was already on teams. So I just talked to people. Emma was already drunk. It ended with her joining into the groups I was talking to and bumping me and making me bump into people. At one point she put her hand over mouth. She kept wanting to talk bout me not hanging out with her anymore (to which I told her we could talk about it later).

I later asked Emma what was up that night and she said she did not remember anything (I found it hard to believe). Another night, she ended up walking me to my car and we talked about the whole thing and she told me her friends suggested that we should be friends. After that I gave her space, it was clear she needed it. There had been several hang outs we were at, and our interactions were a little awkward. We had a long conversation about things again. And it seemed like things were fine and we could interact and it wasn’t too weird. 

Fast forward to last week, I went to trivia and Emma was really avoiding me. I had invited a few people from our friend group to my party, so when Emma, one of the people I invited, and I were in conversation they brought it up. I asked her if we were good and she told me that was a weird question to ask, so I sort of just let it go. On another occasion, at a club, Emma started making small digs at me in front of people. So I decided to leave.

When I got home I ended up talking to Emma for hours. She told me that she did’t trust me and said she was hurt that I ghosted her. Which surprised me. But I explained that I did’t see it that way. There was one conversation, in particular, she mentioned, where she sent me poems, and she wanted me to send her poems back but I didn’t want to send her poems (I already sent one).

It was clear that she was mad about the poems. Towards the end of the call, she said she was mad that the party came up and she should have left earlier and that I was in the wrong for it having come up.

I cried and then started trying to think if I am an asshole for pushing her (figuratively) and nagging, especially since I see her every 2 years or if my actions were valid.

53,1crb9p4,AITA for not allowing my mother to spend time with my son anymore?,"Okay, so here's the deal. I have 3 children, but my oldest is from a previous relationship. I have two toddlers with my current partner while my oldest is 7 years old. My mom loves and adores all of my kids, but she only ever takes my oldest out to lunch or to spend the night at her house. I get that younger children may be too much for her to handle as she is getting older, but even my younger kids are at an age now that they recognize that my oldest child is the only one who gets to spend time with their nana.

Unfortunately the other group members had basically not done anything either with the exception of one girl.

55,1crb2yt,AITA for refusing to let my sister borrow my car?,"I (28m) have a 2011 Nissan, not the nicest car but it gets the job done. I don't use it everyday because I work from home Tuesday/Thursday/Friday. Becuase of this, I tend to lend my car occasionally to friends or family if someone needs it. The only thing I usually ask is that the car be returned in a clean condition with the same amount of gas as was originally in the tank. 

I have two sisters, Jackie(26f) and Melissa (20f) who use my car often as we live in a smaller town and its just easier than getting their own. Jackie has been using my car since I got it back when we were in highschool so we're pretty used to sharing and there hasn't been any issues. 

Melissa has borrowed the car on and off for the last few years between high school and coming home on college breaks. She usually borrows the car to go out with friends/run errands and I have said yes. However I have regretted doing so each time. 

There was one time, she didn't refill the gas and I was left practically on empty. Her excuse was ""it was late at night when I got home and I didn't feel safe going to the station that late"" which was fine, I asked if she could venmo me the money to fill it up, she said yes, but never did. 

There was another time when she had some friends in town to visit so I let her borrow it to drive into the closest city (about 45 mins) to actually have stuff to do with them. When it was returned the car was totally trashed. Fast food wrappers everywhere, lip gloss in my seat, a vape crushed on my floor, and a general stench of weed. I had to pay 150$ to get it totally detailed and cleaned. I asked for a reimbursment, was again told sure, and never recieved it. 

These are only two examples of at least 20 in which she has returned my car in poor condition. I have tried to talk to our parents about it, but all they have to say is that she is young and doesnt understand the true responsibility of having a car yet, and that I as the older brother should cut her some slack. 

Most recently she asked to borrow the car for her 21st birthday in a week. She is having friends fly into the city and has a 'girls trip' sort of weekend planned. But I said no and it basically set off world war three in my family.

My sister has gone nuclear claiming I am ruining her birthday. My parents are agreeing with her and my mom said I'm being too harsh and that its only one weekend so to stop making a stink about it.  

I feel like Ive given her so many chances over so many years and she has always let me down (Jackie agrees) but I also get that a 21st birthday is a once in a lifetime special experience that she will never be able to get back. So should I let her use the car? Or am I th asshole for standing my ground and saying no?

I rarely get sick but when I do it tends to be pretty bad, now I don't want to sound rude but my wife can be an absolute terror to deal with when I'm home. She's a wonderful person, but she's extremely loud in terms of voice.

  
A few days ago, I told her I was feeling sick and may want to stay home for a few days (i get paid sick leave so its not an issue) and she was furious, saying that she can't handle another person around right now, especially not risking our daughter getting sick. (She's a SAHM and we have a 6 year old daughter) my head was throbbing too much to try saying anything about it, so I went to 'work'. Half-way on my way to work I gave up, realising I was not in the condition to go. I called in sick and then called a friend to pick me up. 

Tray picked me up, he works from home so it wasn't a big issue for him and I stayed over at his place. It was admittedly awesome. No screaming and I got to sleep most of it off. I did this for 2 days after that and yesterday got caught. My wife felt bad about screaming at me while I had a headache and making me go to work when I was sick and so went to my work with some broth(?), I'm sorry I don't know the english word but a kind of soup in a mug you drink to get better from cold's. 

I got back and she asked where I had been. I could already tell from her voice that she knew, so I just told the truth. She started yelling at me about how I could lie to her like that, and how dumb I was for 'wasting' my sick-days. I get the lying part but I was sick. I just wanted the screaming to stop so I asked her why it mattered? I was out of the house in the hours she wanted me to be, and it wasn't affecting her. I got kicked to the guest room.

We both work from home about half the time, so we each need separate spaces at home to work from. He currently works in our second bedroom, and I work in the living room. We will each only have 4 weeks of maternity/paternity leave, but after that, I can continue to work from home through the end of the year. My parents live out of state and they have already assured us that they will stay in a hotel when they come to visit us to meet the baby, which can be anytime I choose.

My in-laws live about 3 hours away and we drive to visit them every couple of months for a long weekend. This will be their first grandchild. I like to keep our house pretty clean and organized and we have no pets. My in-laws have a massive dog that sheds all over their house, and they do not keep a clean/organized house at all. I dread going to stay with them, but they are perfectly nice and I want to have a good relationship with them so I suck it up for a few days even though I am totally grossed out and have allergy issues when we stay there. My in-laws have never come to stay with us since we have lived in the same state, we always go to them.

Okay so here's my issue. My husband has made the assumption that my MIL will stay with us for several days to weeks after the baby comes to ""help out"". I told him that I don't think we need any help with just one baby, especially since I have extensive childcare experience and am a medical professional. I don't want anyone to come and stay as a guest, who I have to clean up after, on top of having a new baby for the first time. His argument is that she will be there to help watch the baby and to cook and clean for us. I don't want her to do any of that, partially because I find it unnecessary and partially because I'm certain it will just create more work for me.

My in-laws are welcome to come and visit for a few days at a time and see the baby for a few hours at a time, but I don't want *anyone* staying in our apartment with us. We have just enough space for us to both work from home comfortably and can convert our second bedroom into a nursery when the time comes. I want to eliminate the guest bed and ask his parents to stay in a hotel when they come to visit.

59,1cra93y,AITA for not wanting to play catch with my gf? ,"So I (25 F) have been with my partner (24 F) for 5 years now.
 
She's struggled in her life to make friends and maintain social connections, and it still remains a struggle the 5 years we've been together. We have not been diagnosed, but I have suspicions about us both being on the autistic spectrum. This may explain the social difficulties, I have similar struggles but they seem to affect her more deeply as her desire for friends is higher than mine. 

She recently took up a co-ed sport team for softball, a hobby she used to previously love. So far she's been having a blast but hasn't made any friends yet. She's been looking for someone to practice with and as such I'm basically her only option. 

Problem is I'm just not good at catching, or throwing, or sports as a whole in general. Ive reluctantly said yes a few times, but generally I'm not enjoying myself the entire time. It has nothing to do with her, I work almost daily 12 hour shifts and am also extremely exhausted by the time we are together in the evening. 

It's started to become an argument, because it feels like I can't say no to a request without it turning into a big spiel about how ""I'm her only option"" and that I should always want play because it's ""quality time together"". For me, I'd much rather we sit and relax together to spend that ""quality time"" and keep  extracurriculars to weekends or days off. 

Today (Monday) she asked me again, I politely declined and suggested something else. She started down the spiral of going on about how she's always struggled to keep friends and that she's not asking me for much. It came off a bit harsh, but I sort of hit a breaking point and just said. ""You not being able to make or keep friends, past or present, isn't my problem and it's not fair for you to expect me to ALWAYS want to partake in activities i don't enjoy JUST because you're my girlfriend.""

62,1cr9fs8,AITA for expecting people to give me info I need to work on there cars,"Okay title sounds wierd so here's a quick explanation.

I 22f am a level 2 mechanic apprentice and I give my family and friends ""deals"" for car repairs. I don't charge them anything if they supply me the parts (I send them the links to the parts they need) and all the info of tools are required for the job (I.e socket sizes, pliers, wrenchs, hammer) I require this because I have to bring my tools from work and if they fail to give me this info, I can't work on their vehicle and have wasted time. 

Now I don't expect non car people to know everything, if someone says they don't know what I need to bring. I recommend they watch a YouTube video and to send me the list of tools the person says in the video. I OFTEN DOUBLE CHECK AND WATCH VIDEOS MYSELF TO GUARANTEE THE LIST OF TOOLS. I do this because I believe everyone should understand how their vehicles work and it's great for learning about your car. 

This is where I might be the asshole. 
Someone I know asked if I could replace their brakes and I gave them my list of terms on the repair of the vehicle. I was told that it was unreasonable for me to demand they order the parts themselves and ask for a list of tools that the job requires, because that's what I'm for. 

I responded with that they are getting the labour for free and most videos are 15 minutes long and most shops in my area charge 140 an hour for labour and brakes all around can be anywhere from 2-4 hours. It's not that hard to supply me with the info and parts. 

Now I'm being called an asshole, because it's my job and if they have to the work to give me the info they should just pay a shop to do it. 

I'm just trying to help friends and family save money, and I don't think it's unreasonable, so AITA? 

Edit:
I'm not a full mechanic yet, I don't have my license yet, but I'm very close. I have 5 years of experience and over 10,000 hours of in shop training. I work in a brand specific shop, but have knowledge of working on other brands of vehicles.

I personally never grew up that close to her, and we didn’t really talk much at all. I love her but she can be kind of toxic sometimes and keep really stress dynamics going.

So I didn’t call for mother day yesterday, bc I was chilling with my sister and her kids all I honestly forgot. Until I got a late text from my dad complaining that I didn’t call.

I just don’t like the dynamic of her telling on me and other cousins who don’t call and who aren’t that close with her or speak with her on a daily basis.

Idk, it pissed me off thst she sits at home making a list of people who didn’t call just to gossip about them. Even when I did call today she said “you’re about a day late” lol it’s laughable but tbh it’s a weird dynamic that I wish everyone would stop perceiving as cute or funny 


Mind you I usually don’t forget, but I was busy living my life lol

","I'm (38m) (or was) in a relationship with a girl for the past year or so. While there are several issues in our relationship, today's topic is money.



Background: We both work for a big company, we both earn the same give or take, and it's an amount that  provide for our needs, without making us wealthy. When I approached her romantically and in the original stages of the relationship I would pay most of the times when we would go out, I'd buy her small gifts and during the first month that she stayed at my place while searching for her own flat I didn't ask for rent or utilities (though she offered to assist with the utilities and I declined). Then some worrying patterns emerged; She would constantly whine about how her finances are tight, she would not stop me from paying her the amount for even a single morning coffee that she brought me, she would accept money from me for a concert ticket that she bought as a present for her ex and the tops she would do is to prepare food while we were in her place which almost every time I would go out and get us dessert/fruits/wine/whatever as an appreciation gesture (something she would rarely do when I was doing the same at my place). Then we decided to go dutch - every time that she was paying for something I would instantly reach for my phone and send her my share, being extremely mindful about it. Apart from a couple of times that I would tell her ""that's on me"" we would split everything. She was rarely forgetting to ask for my share (for example lunches that she thought I haven't paid her, which I had to just show her the transaction to prove it) and a couple of times she would be like ""oh you paid for that uber so that's one is on me"". Note here, she got plenty of presents and gifts from me, I have received almost nothing (irregardless if it is expensive or not). Now, there were several cases that I would get her something that she asked (cigarettes, groceries etc) and she would forget to pay me. I found it extremely petty to ask my gf for that, so I never did and I had no problem with it.



Fast forward to a situation where we were splitting the cost of a gift for her friend's birthday. Hours after purchasing the gift, she reminded me to send her $20 for my share. I reacted angrily, stating, ""You won't lose your money, don't worry, as you never have before,"" and instantly venmoed my share. She noticed my irritation and asked what was wrong. I expressed my frustration, feeling it was petty for her to request such a small amount when she often overlooked the times that she forgot to do the same. She escalated the situation, calling me ""psycho"" for reacting this way, arguing that she did nothing wrong—after all, she was simply asking for the money I had agreed to pay and I should have done the same.

65,1cr8zjw,AITA for using tutor’s time outside of lessons?,"
I have been taking courses for a hobby with a private tutor, let’s call her Sara, for some months. My goal is to eventually turn this hobby into a profession. It is important to know that while Sara is not a personal friend, we have mutual friends.

Because of private reasons from both sides, we took several weeks of a break in lessons. For planning new lessons, I asked Sara if we could have a quick call to schedule and to give me some ideas how to prepare. She agreed and suggested a time and date for the call. She was very tense in the call and seemed annoyed. But I didn’t take anything personally.

Sara always encouraged me to not just send her plain text when zu need her feedback but to send pictures or recordings. I almost never used this offer until now. So I sent her 3-4 recording, each one of about 10-15secs (in total less than 90s) to give her an idea what I had in mind to work on together. I asked if she had a spare minute within the next weeks if she could take a look at it. Her response was short and blunt: “sorry, not gonna listen to that, just send me an email” I was very irritated since she always encouraged me to send visual and auditory inputs in between lessons.

It turns out she had been complaining about to our mutual friend already about me. She said that she was offering me a foot and that I took the mile and that I am harassing her with constant messages.

So her demand now is that I acknowledge that I have been acting entitled and that I pay her for the time on the phone call. (Maybe 10-15mins in which mostly she spoke) and for the time she spent listening to these recordings. She thinks I am TA for demanding her time outside of lessons.

I on the other hand think it should be normal that she as a tutor at some point might need to take some time to plan lessons with students. Giving a short feedback every now and then to help the student prepare for the lesson should be included, since I pay a lot for her services. I don’t think I demanded anything, I always asked if she could check it out during a spare minute, I asked if she would be available for a phone call etc. I fell she’s Ta for ranting to our friends before talking to me and for demanding money for something that should be included (and if not, she should communicate professionally about it)

66,1cr8y0i,AITA for 'choosing' my friend over my girlfriend on Mother's Day?,"I've been with girlfriend, Leah (22), for 2 and a half years now. 

Leah doesn't have a family. Her dad died and her mom, a very unkind, unloving and materialistic woman, later died after putting Leah through years of hell. Her siblings are also dead or left the family. It's no doubt this has impacted her quite heavily, making days like Mother's Day very hard. Since attending a university and realizing how much she'll never have after experiencing other students talk about their parents, Leah started therapy but it went awful. Just a lot of gaslighting. All of these factors made yesterday a lot more tough (not to mention cashiers reminding us to reach out to our moms and let them know how grateful we are for them). I took her camping for the weekend. 

We got home yesterday evening. To end the night I planned for me to make her a nice dinner (we didn't have snacks in the house, just the ingredients to make dinner...you'll see why this is important), take an edible, and play some games, and she was super excited about this. But before that I wanted to talk to my friend via zoom. 

Leah told me have fun and come get her out of the bedroom when I was done. Now I intended for the talk to go for 3ish hours, giving me enough time to make dinner and enjoy the night.

But my friend and I got talking a lot longer than planned. He was struggling too, and  we hadn't talked in a week. After 4 hours I told Leah I was going to try to wrap things up and she told alright. Ultimately two more hours went by, and Leah told me she was just going to bed and I heard the door close. I checked on her and she said she was just wanted to be left alone.

She got upset that I didn't end up coming to bed (it was 11 and the talk ended, so I fell asleep on the sofa), but also I didn't even apologize. I told her I could understand her anger but my friend was going through a hard time too and I wanted to be there for him, and we had gone camping.

She went off work mid-2022 to focus on getting better. Her husband isn’t the most supportive.
I offered to help with long term disability (LTD) app in AUG/SEP2022, but she said she didn’t need help, had it under control and app was pretty much done. I asked her for updates from time to time and she said everything was fine.
DEC 2022 I found out that she had been fired from her job while she was on sick leave and never submitted the LTD application. Things were worse with her mental health than she made it seem. 
Her Employer tried to reach out to her by email but my sis didn’t get back to them. So was let go on the grounds of job abandonment. They didn’t try calling her or the union before letting her go.
I was annoyed that my sis was dishonest about her situation and that things had gotten to where they were. Her employer didn’t help her with the LTD app when she asked. They gave her the run around and expected her to instead apply for disability through the government.
I stepped in to help after realizing she was fired and didn’t apply for LTD. I contacted her union and tried to get things back on track -file a grievance and submit LTD forms. Sis finally got everything submitted in the winter of 2023/2024. She said the reason for the delay was that the insurance company wanted more info about her medical history from all healthcare providers.
We recently found out that her LTD claim was denied bcuz she missed the app deadline.
My parents are constantly asking me to help with the appeal. I had a discussion with sis about finding a lawyer and not missing the appeal deadline.
A week has gone by I asked her for an update and sis made no progress, but made it out like she called some lawyers. I don’t know if she’s being honest or lying again. It’s extremely frustrating to deal with. I am fed up and told her last night that I am done, I can’t help her anymore. I don’t have the energy to give anymore. It looked like she didn’t want to hear it and couldn’t wait for me to get out of her car. 
It’s extremely difficult to deal with a person who isn’t honest and isn’t motivated to help themselves. I know most of this mayb attributed to her mental health but I am exhausted and emotionally drained. 
To add, after getting more involved I found out that she missed a few of her appointments with her psychologist, who almost discharged her as a patient. She wasn’t responding to her union rep who would call, email and mail letters to her asking for updates- we now we have a group chat between the three of us to address that. 
Her husband expressed some frustration because she wasn’t fully honest with him either about her finances and she was about $10k in credit card debt because she has no income. Mom and husband helped pay that off.

I stepped in to help after realizing she was fired and didn’t apply for LTD. I contacted her union and tried to get things back on track -file a grievance and submit LTD forms. Sis finally got everything submitted in the winter of 2023/2024. She said the reason for the delay was that the insurance company wanted more info about her medical history from all healthcare providers.
We recently found out that her LTD claim was denied bcuz she missed the app deadline.
My parents are constantly asking me to help with the appeal. I had a discussion with sis about finding a lawyer and not missing the appeal deadline.
A week has gone by I asked her for an update and sis made no progress, but made it out like she called some lawyers. I don’t know if she’s being honest or lying again. It’s extremely frustrating to deal with. I am fed up and told her last night that I am done, I can’t help her anymore. I don’t have the energy to give anymore. It looked like she didn’t want to hear it and couldn’t wait for me to get out of her car. 
It’s extremely difficult to deal with a person who isn’t honest and isn’t motivated to help themselves. I know most of this mayb attributed to her mental health but I am exhausted and emotionally drained. 
To add, after getting more involved I found out that she missed a few of her appointments with her psychologist, who almost discharged her as a patient. She wasn’t responding to her union rep who would call, email and mail letters to her asking for updates- we now we have a group chat between the three of us to address that. 
Her husband expressed some frustration because she wasn’t fully honest with him either about her finances and she was about $10k in credit card debt because she has no income. Mom and husband helped pay that off.
I want to be there for her but it’s getting to be too much for me, AITA for wanting to step away from all this?",0.0,0.023335421457886696,0,1
69,1cr8hji,AITA because I wanted my friends to understand me?,"

I’ve posted this once without getting much interaction but here goes a short version.

I had 2 friends for about 7 years and we did everything together. Emily and josh were great. 

Down the line I got super weirded out with Emily as she congratulated a mutual friend who I had a thing with on getting a new girlfriend and how pretty she was. She told me  she said this to him nonchalantly and I didn’t talk to her for months. She said I was exaggerating until she popped back up into my life.


I introduced a new guy Allen into then group and well we all found things in common with each other but I notice Allen would stir the pot with my other friend group he was apart of. Despite this months later I notice him calling me an idiot and dumb while also comparing me to his ex while also asking me to date him. 

Emily and josh got the impression he was joking.

On a night out he asked me to kiss his cheek and in a friendly manner I did but didn’t think much of it since we were all friends. 


He then threw a small gathering and he touched my stomach twice all while I said no and I just felt really weird.


He’s asked Emily if she would date him and then asked me. Emily felt uncomfortable. 

Anyway I exploded and told both Emily and josh I do not feel comfortable with him and just felt weird given he’s touched me weirdly multiple times and the insults. 

At first Emily and josh understood but they didn’t stop hanging with him.

I again told them how I felt and Emily said I was controlling and that I’m not a true friend trying to control her and her bond with josh. And josh understood the severity of the situation as I gave him a compression of it happened to his sister and he got pissed and said absolutely not. But then came back to me and he said he just couldn’t say that to Allen and break the bond it was weird. 

Emily couldn’t put herself in the situation. After I had that confrontation I told them they simply are just my social friends and nothing more. Josh looked shocked and Emily wasn’t phased. She kept saying she didn’t understand because she had emotionally unavailable parents.


Cut them all off and they all hang with each other although mutual friends of Allen and I both have seen this side of Allen and also find him creepy and have concluded that touching is not ok.

70,1cr8glc,AITA for telling my nephew in law that littering is bad and if we weren’t in the car I’d ask him to pick up his trash? ,"Hello all

A while ago I (30f) was driving in the car after grocery shopping. My husband’s 23 year old nephew was with me. He asked me for a snack and a drink, so I bought him one as he couldn’t buy it himself (he was staying with us at the time as he temporarily had no job or place to stay, financially we also took care of him for four months, now he has a job and his own house).

He ate his snack and drank from his drink in the car on the way home. All of a sudden he opens the window and throws his trash out (wrappers from his snack). Needless to say I was pissed, but I remained calm. I explained to him littering is bad and we need to respect the place we live and we need to take care of nature, not pollute it. I said if we weren’t on a busy road I’d stop the car and expect him to actually pick it up. Of course since we are in the car I can’t do that. He apologised and then I let it go.

Today this topic came up at home. My sister (28f) and her almost 6 month old baby are currently staying with my husband and I because her relationship recently ended. She’ll rent a new place soon, but we’re helping her transition. During her stay she has been jokingly criticising the way I communicate and handle things. Through her jokes I could deduct that she sometimes thinks I’m too hard on people. I am very direct and just tell people if I see something I don’t like. She keeps mentioning this in the form of jokes but after a while I started to feel like there’s criticism underneath it. When it comes to my sister however I take a very soft approach and I always try to mince my words because I know she is very sensitive. So I’m less direct with her.

When the topic of the nephew littering came up, my sister said my way of handling it was degrading. She said I must’ve made the guy feel ‘small’ and she thought it was too harsh. She mentioned this next to my husband.

I snapped and started crying, saying I’m tired of being criticised all the time. I try so hard to be gentle with her but now she’s criticising me for how I handled a situation when it has nothing to with her. I told her she comes to stay in my home and keeps criticising me and I’m over it. I told her there’s so many times I bit my tongue when it came to things she has done. I can be a soft and gentle person but I have my boundaries.  I will admit I did raise my voice which was wrong. Then she said I make her feel unwelcome.

Maybe I responded too hard. I don’t know anymore. I’d like to hear some outside perspective. I will apologise to her for raising my voice as that is never ok but I don’t know about everything else. 

Thanks in advance.

While at the first window of a drive thru I noticed a middle aged man standing near the exit talking to what I’m assuming is a friend. 

A few minutes later while at the second window, he was still standing there. After seeing 3 cars drive past him I figured he was content with where he was standing and wasn’t crossing the exit of the drive thru. As I was leaving he decided to try and pass in front of my car when I was about 2-3 feet away. I slammed on the brakes but he waved me on, so I gave a smile and waved as a thank you. I still had my window down and heard him loudly saying “THANKS FOR STOPPING, ENTITLED B!TCH” while flipping me off. 

I debated pulling over to apologize but was worried there was a chance it could escalate the situation seeing how he was already worked up about it. I do feel bad about it because I can understand how it would come across as me not respecting him as a pedestrian.

72,1cr7wv6,AITA for not wanting to take advantage of my siblings?,"I was extremely lucky and got not one but two opportunities to purchase tickets to Taylor Swift tickets for one of the cities. On top of that, I actually ended up being able to buy four tickets to two different dates. (I tried both times to try to get seats together the second time).

These tickets were purchased in August 2023, the concert is not until this fall. 

My plan was to take my daughter and my two sisters for one of the dates, and sell the other tickets. This trip requires us to fly and stay in a hotel for a few nights. 

Since then, my husband and I have fallen on tough times and money is extremely tight. We have debt to pay off and are short on bills each month while he finishes school. I have cut back a LOT on discretionary spending, and have been doing a bit of work on the side to try to get extra funds (on top of my full time job). 

My initial plan was to sell my “extra” tickets at face value. Now given how tight things are, I listed and sold these for quite a lot more than face value. ((This money will not be distributed to me until after the concert, but will more than pay for mine and my daughter’s trip, as well as allowing me to pay off my credit card in full if I haven’t done so by then)).  Note: I KNOW I am the AH for this, I feel awful about it and morally feel like a real piece of garbage for being a scalper, so I don’t need comments about this part of things, but it’s relevant to the rest of the story. 

Now on to the AITA part: my husband feels like since I paid for the tickets and *could* sell them for a lot of money, I should be asking my sisters to pay more than face value, since we are so financially strapped.  My one sister put our flights and accommodations on her card, and did the math on who owes what.  I recently sent her the remaining money for tickets and that’s what caused this fight. He believes that I am hurting our family and allowing my siblings to take advantage. 

I am struggling to even on the basest level understand why he would think I am wrong for not wanting to do this. He thinks i should tell them I can’t afford to go and wait for them to offer to cover mine and my daughter’s portion.

Both of our kids are bit spoiled, and get pretty much everything they want for birthdays etc. As a result, my stepdaughter has managed to save up £200 since Christmas - not because she's not buying things she wants, but because she didn't want anything. She got very into reading, and we just bought her the books she wanted because we think it's a great thing to encourage.

She really likes Roblox, and has been trying to explain to us that there's an offer on right now for £200 (approx $250) that would get her 22,500 Robux (the in-game currency) rather than the normal amount of 20,000. This would also get her some special golden headphones (in the game, not in real life), and she would be able to buy this (apparently) super prestigious outfit called the Korblox Deathspeaker. It's basically a way of showing off how much money you have in the game. But she only wants the leg - the outfit has one tiny leg which other people would be really impressed with, so we've been told. I saw a Reddit post saying ""Korblox is LITERALLY a toothpick for rich people to have on their leg.""

We're stuck on what to do with this. On the one hand, it's her money, she saved it up, and if she spends it on this then she won't have any money left. And maybe she should have the autonomy to do that if she wants.

But on the other hand her pocket money would come in, so it's not like I think she would feel any kind of impact from it. And it's £200 for a tiny leg. I can't even type this without feeling so ridiculously embarrassed to ask the question. There are families who live on less than this a week. How can we talk about the value of money and approve of something like this? My fiancée and I are really aligned on this.

Extra info: For absolute clarity - this is not an actual leg, or any kind of tangible leg or product. This is a virtual item in a video game.

At 2:12am he called me again and said that he had been waiting for the guy who jumped to the car to come back out of the bar because the guy was really drunk had lost his credit cards had a high bar tab and was trying to figure stuff out but he said that he would be leaving soon. 

At 3:01am I woke up and realized he still wasn't home so I called him and he said that they were closing the bar and he would be leaving and would be home within 45 minutes at most.

At 3:17am he called to say that he went to start the car and it wouldn't start again so he was waiting on somebody to jump it. 

At 4:01am I called to find out what's going on and he said that he went to drop the guy off and the guy said that he would give him a battery so he was waiting for the guy to give him a battery that he had to use for my car.

At 4:27am he called me to let me know he was on his way home and came in around 4:47am.

I got really mad and feel like he should have either just contacted roadside assistance like I recommended or after waiting for the guy for a few minutes should have just said hey I need to get home and left.

77,1cr7n31,AITA for wanting to kick my friend out,"I (27m) invited my friend John (29m) of about 10 years from across the country to come live with me because they were going through a hard time financially and to have a fresh start. 

Living in my current apartment supposed to last a couple of months. we were planning to move into a 2 bedroom by January & then we pushed to April since I was traveling.

John was able to find a decent job 1-2 weeks after moving. He pays rent now but we came up with an agreement he wouldn’t have to pay for the first 3 months. He pays 1/3rd & I cover the rest. The plan to move keeps being pushed because his spending habits aren't the best and he's more focused on living the city life.

John also doesn't drive & has to uber to & from work. I used to drop him off in the morning on my work from home days or pick him up if I'm in the office (i pass his job on the way home). I told John to take the bus to offset the $20-$30 uber each way but he doesn't want to since he works 12 hour shifts. I would also get him Ubers/send him money for rides. I stopped sending him money/getting ubers, taking him to work. I will only pick him up now if I’m in the office. I told him he should be responsible for finding his own way & being more independent.

John complains about money but also wants to go out. I can afford it financially. On the days that he's hungover he will just call off of work or show up late. l've talked to him about being a bit more responsible with going into work because it seems like he's getting comfortable and not focused on moving. He received it well and said he would get better. He expects me to wake him up if he oversleeps & then is mad at me when I don’t. I told him it’s not my responsibility to make sure he’s awake and on his way to work. this is a common theme with John. He gets upset when I don’t respond in way he wants to.

Aside from John’s irresponsibility, we’ve gotten into multiple arguments and fights that have just blown out of proportion. we talk about it and are easily able to get over it and doesn’t like it when I link similar occasions to one another trying to establish a pattern. He doesn’t think past situation should be brought up, but sometimes I think it’s important to touch on a certain situation if it’s reoccurring.

To add to arguments, there was also some property damage to the window screens and front door after he lost his key and couldn’t get in while I was out at a friends house. John was also drunk and fell putting a hole into the wall. With this property damage came some noise complaints (which i’ve never had before he moved in). 

Living together has definitely put a toll on our friendship and it’s beginning to be too much. I’m at a breaking point where I want to be comfortable and have my own space again. I feel bad for wanting to give him a 60 day notice knowing his current financial situation. I feel somewhat taken advantage of and like I constantly have to hold his hand.

78,1cr7mx3,AITA for telling my friend that her business proposal seems unfair to me and I don't really *need* her to open up an Etsy?,"I (22F) like to paint and draw as a hobby. My family and friends have suggested that I opened an Etsy shop and I have considered it, but wanted to focus on my career first since I majored in something completely different (finance).

My friend (22F) has been struggling to find a job and moved towards starting a small business as a way to make money. She's considered dropshipping, etsy, and etc.

She's been trying to convince me to open up an Etsy with her by selling stickers, since I made stickers for myself and my friends for fun and they really liked it. Based on her idea, I would design and create all the stickers while she and I would both manage the shop and sell them. We would be business partners and split the proceeds equally.

I told her that I'm not interested in opening up an Etsy shop right now because I wanted to focus on my career first but she keeps insisting and tried pushing me to create some designs to get started.

She insisted that I needed a side hustle if I was going to survive in this economy and I needed her for the administrative aspect of selling stickers.

I thought about it some more and the whole idea kinda seems unfair to me? So I told her that if we started this, it sounds like I have more responsibility than her so the profit split seems uneven. It takes a lot of time to create designs. Technically, I wouldn't really need her to start an Etsy since I could do the admin portion myself.

I may have been TA for saying this because my friend's mad that I don't value her skills and for suggesting that I would provide more value to the business because I have artistic skill.

79,1cr7mt3,AITA for making my roomate move out?,"I started university this year and had to move out because it was far away from home. One of the reasons I moved into this house was because the landlady said that boyfriends were not allowed and that was great, because my parents and I were worried that I would end up having roommates who would bring boys into the house whenever they wanted, without warning.

A couple of months ago roomate 1 got a boyfriend and she started to bring him over to the house without telling me about it. It happened twice that she was talking to her boyfriend in the hallway in the middle of the night, and when I left the room to go to the bathroom, they stared at me. it made me uncomfortable because you could see that I wasn't wearing a bra under my pajamas. so when my landlady asked if I was having any problems I told her about this and she said she would talk to  roomate 1 because she and her husband were also having a problem with this situation. But when the time came to speak with  her, roomate 1 was really ofended and hurt. After some days she decided to move out, and her mom even called the landlady to say that her daughter had the right to have a boyfriend and to have him over.

The day after the conversation, tha landlady came to pay a visit to roomaten 2 and they were speaking in the hallway in front of my room because they didn't know that I was home.  From what I could hear the landlady was trying to convince roomate 2, who was on the side on roomate 1 on the boyfriend matter, that she should talk with roomate 1 about not moving out. During this conversation both my landlady and roomate 2 started to call me childish and imature for not understanding roomate 1's situation, even though the landlady previously said that she agreed with me.

I know that it was wrong of them to talk shit about me behind my back, but I am starting to fear that I was to harsh on roomate 1 just because the situation made me unconfortable. However I feel like her and her mom have no right to complain because the no boys rule was established before the 3 of us even moved in. AITA for making my roomate move out?

Update: just to make thigs clear since I don´t think that I explain it propely, The rule was that you were allowed to have boys over as long as they didn´t stay the night in order not to catch anyone by surprise and not to make noise and not to increase the bills since they are split between all of us.

My wife doesn't want to stay together in the small apartment (I had to take care of my parents since they can't speak English and we are living in a country where English is the primary language, my Mom health is not good and she can't walk freely). I didn't ask her to take care of my parents (Everything is handled by my father and I).

However, she still wants to live separately so we decided to move out and rent another garden suite. Since I have to pay for 2 places, we rarely have saving every month (we also have a 16 month old kid). Seeing my difficult finance situation, my sister asks my parents to stay with her  and she will take care of them from now on so we can move back to our current apartment without worrying to pay for 2 places. To move back I have to borrow some more money from the apartment to pay back for my sister (the exact amount she gave my father for the down payment when we bought it), I also want to borrow some more money to give to my parents just to support them...  
  
We all agreed to that till 1 day before moving in, my wife is arguing with my sister that we bought at a fair price, no cheaper than buying from a strange person (however, the price we bought is just more than 50% the price of the similar one in our area - housing here is very expensive), I don't feel good about how she was behaving with my family since they were trying to help us. She also talked to my father that until they completely move out (get rid of all their stuffs as well) then we will move in just 1 day before the move in. I told her that they will move out the same day as we move in since I'm working full-time job so I can't help them to move out in the week-days, and I promised her that when she move the stuffs in, my parents won't be in the apartment anymore. About their stuffs, I said that she can check and if she doesn't need any of these stuffs, I will give them to my father or help him dump them but she doesn't understand and always says as long as they don't move out and move their stuffs out, she won't come back so we have to canceled the plan to move in (I asked a friend to help with moving stuffs but I had to cancel as well).  
  
After many times arguing with her, I decided not refinance the apartment with her (and putting her name to the deed for now anymore), I told her that I have a place for her to live and my parents had already moved out to my sister's place, and asked her to move back to my apartment, but she doesn't want to come back if I don't add her to the deed and mortgage. I said that I will pay the mortgage and don't use any of her money to pay for it but she said that we are a family, it's still the money that is supposed for the family after all.

82,1cr7em1,AITA for planing Mothers Day for a friend and „ruining it“ for her husband?,"Yesterday was Mother’s Day  in our country. My husband is friends with John (not his real name) since forever and I became very good friends with John and his Wife Anna as well. Last year they became parents to a beautiful daughter and we were asked to be godparents to her. John has to take kind of a exam for his job this week so I knew he would be stressed and maybe doesn’t have a free head for Mothers Day. Anna is very relaxed about most things and their wedding was also super relaxed but she admitted that she struggles to communicate if she wants more effort. 

That’s why I wrote him as message that I thought Anna would love some attention for Mother’s Day and that I wanted to make something special for her first Mothers Day. We could both brainstorm and I would help him organise everything since I knew he had the exam. He said that he’s too busy to even think about it. I was annoyed but knew Anna would be sad so I offered him that I would organise everything and he only had to put his name under it if he wants? He told me that he would think about it and text me later about it. That was two weeks before Mothers Day. He never texted. So I did something on my own. I made a photo album for her with pictures from the first eight months of their family, baked her a cake, got her flowers and a reservation and gift card for some food place she loves for dinner. I came over after breakfast, we hugged and she seemed absolutely touched. John was sleeping upstairs.

John wrote a furious message to my husband that I overstepped boundaries and ruined Mother’s Day. My husband told me completely shocked. I felt super bad although I didn’t quite know what was wrong. I called Anna - ready to apologise if any gift was inappropriate. She told me everything was fine and she was happy about my effort but had a huge fight with John. John said I lead him on to think I would take care of everything and that’s why he didn’t get anything. I did offer it but he never agreed or texted me back about it. Anna also said she doesn’t believe him. He didn’t even wish her a happy Mother’s Day before I came (he was sleeping late in the morning). She also said he watched TV all weekend.

My husband is on my side but some of our friends and John are saying I did make him look bad and that I should have texted him again to ask him if he would put his name under the presents?

John has to take kind of a exam for his job this week so I knew he would be stressed and maybe doesn’t have a free head for Mothers Day. Anna is very relaxed about most things and their wedding was also super relaxed but she admitted that she struggles to communicate if she wants more effort. 

That’s why I wrote him as message that I thought Anna would love some attention for Mother’s Day and that I wanted to make something special for her first Mothers Day. We could both brainstorm and I would help him organise everything since I knew he had the exam. He said that he’s too busy to even think about it. I was annoyed but knew Anna would be sad so I offered him that I would organise everything and he only had to put his name under it if he wants? He told me that he would think about it and text me later about it. That was two weeks before Mothers Day. He never texted. So I did something on my own. I made a photo album for her with pictures from the first eight months of their family, baked her a cake, got her flowers and a reservation and gift card for some food place she loves for dinner. I came over after breakfast, we hugged and she seemed absolutely touched. John was sleeping upstairs.

John wrote a furious message to my husband that I overstepped boundaries and ruined Mother’s Day. My husband told me completely shocked. I felt super bad although I didn’t quite know what was wrong. I called Anna - ready to apologise if any gift was inappropriate. She told me everything was fine and she was happy about my effort but had a huge fight with John. John said I lead him on to think I would take care of everything and that’s why he didn’t get anything. I did offer it but he never agreed or texted me back about it. Anna also said she doesn’t believe him. He didn’t even wish her a happy Mother’s Day before I came (he was sleeping late in the morning). She also said he watched TV all weekend.

My husband is on my side but some of our friends and John are saying I did make him look bad and that I should have texted him again to ask him if he would put his name under the presents?

85,1cr75zq,AITA for walking out of my mom's house on Mother's Day even after she lost my sister not too long ago because she was disrespectful to my wife?,"My sister died 6 months ago so yesterday was my mom's first Mother's Day after the loss of one of her kids. And the kid who made her a mom at that. I (24m) wanted to make it special for mom and my wife was more than happy to help me, even though Mother's Day is rough for her because she was not given a good or even a ""tries her best"" mother. So the day is a painful reminder that my wife didn't ever have a healthy maternal figure in her life. Father's Day is similar but she never knew her father and never had a good father figure either.

My wife still wanted to help make mom's first Mother's Day without my sister special. We went around getting all my mom's favorite things (favorite flowers, ice cream, chocolate, a reservation for her favorite restaurant, a scarf in her favorite color because scarves are her favorite thing ever). We also compiled a little video of my sister. Mom talked about Mother's Day being more difficult without her and wanting to watch some home movies of her so we did something special with that. My wife also helped me recreate a dance I did for my mom on Mother's Day when I was a kid because she talked about that a lot. Basically it was just meant to show how much we love her and help her through this not so easy Mother's Day. My wife played a very big role. She even suggested bringing breakfast to her and serving her breakfast in bed.

Yesterday morning came, we made her favorite breakfast and bought it to mom at her and dad's. After she came out of her room is when things went to shit. Mom saw my wife and asked what she was doing there and didn't look like she wanted my wife there. It surprised me because my wife was with us last year too. Mom was grumbling and hostile to my wife. I told mom that we'd planned some special things for her. This didn't change anything and she told me she didn't want my wife there. Then she told my wife she had no right to intrude and why would she want her there. My wife said she was sorry, she hadn't wanted to upset her. I told mom that she was being rude and it wasn't right to take her sadness out on my wife. Mom said she just wanted us to spend Mother's Day as a family and I told her my wife is family. My mother grumbled and dad asked me to lay off. My wife said it was fine. But then mom started on my wife a few minutes later and after she'd opened most of her gifts and she said she was tired of her being here and her own mother hadn't even wanted her so why did she think she'd be welcome. That was too much for me. I told mom I should have left earlier but I wanted to be understanding and supportive but she had crossed a line and I was done. That she could celebrate Mother's Day without us.

My wife and I left. She felt bad and I told her not to and I apologized for not leaving sooner. She told me I didn't need to leave and I told her I did. Mom and dad both texted me countless times yesterday saying I should go back and how could I abandon mom after she lost my sister.

87,1cr6ul0,WIBTA If I confront my sister for ruining her relationship with our mother?,"Hey everyone, first time poster here but decently long-time reader. This one is long, so hopefully everything makes sense.

I (21m) come from a divorced family, where both parents have gotten remarried, to once again get divorced years down the line. My (14f) sister is the only sibling I have from my mom’s second marriage with my stepfather. Unlike my father’s second marriage, I still call my stepfather by their title because he wasn’t a POS to me.

Anyways, my (51f) mother and sister have begun butting heads quite more than usual. I know conflict is normal, however the last few times I’ve witnessed arguments first hand, my sister has been downright vicious. I find it hard to believe this is normal for any mother/daughter relationship.

For context, my mother and (51m) stepfather got divorced about 3 years ago now. My mom has begun seeing and living with her (mid-50s) boyfriend, who doesn’t try to parent us, but I understand can be alarming for someone like my sister to see right after her parents told her within the past year that they are getting a divorce.

Mother’s Day was yesterday and the main reason for this post: I just got home from college to visit my mom, and a silly argument (like legitimately myself, my mother, AND my sister smiling laughing at numerous points) arose over my sister wanting me to take her to a department store nearby for clothes, which I explained to her I wouldn’t. Though seemingly at random, my sister snapped, got actually upset, insulted us a few times before walking to her room. My sister snapped again. She began to claim how “you (Mom) always take his (OP) side of any argument,” how you “never reprimand him,” and then began to cite recent events such as a nasty argument around Christmas time where my sister didn’t come home from her fathers for about a month, even missing Christmas.

My mom began to yell back at her, claiming that if she acted like this as a kid her door would be off its hinges, she wouldn’t leave my room for months, and that my sister is ungodly “spoiled rotten and rude.”

After my sister went to her room, my mom began to break down in frustration and crying, saying how rude my sister is, how her anxiety is now through the roof because she fears anything she will say to my sister will make her want leave for her dads (which is now reinforced behavior as she has done this time and again; my mom hates it and will yell at her about it, but ultimately won’t force her to stay if she doesn’t want to).

My mom will often drop anything for her, take her shopping constantly, drive her and pick her up from school almost every day, etc. I feel like my sister is just at this point emotionally abusing my mother as if she blames her for the divorce, and getting away with whatever she wants from her father who seems to never parent her.

91,1cr611q,AITA for telling my dad to burn his mom?,"Gonna keep this as straightforward as possible. Yes, the title is clickbait-y but I need y'all to engage with this post. 

Relevant Players: Dad (50sM), Me (20sF), and Grandma (70sF) 

  
Grandma was sick for years (dementia) but Dad did not make arrangements for her death. He acknowledges this and regrets this, and wishes he would have but didn't want to accept her death. He says that she has always told him that she does not want to be cremated.

Now she has died and the life insurance payout is $10K. 

General Breakdown of Expected Funeral Costs for What He Wants to Give Her: 

* Funeral: $8200 
* Casket: $7600 
* Burial Plot: $6000 
* Other Cemetery Cost: $3500 

Total: Approx $25K

So far, he hasn't wanted to budge on any of the expenses. Buying our own casket helps out some but breaks up the funeral home package. We don't know much about buying a plot via a website/non-funeral home to rely on that for budgeting. He does not want to cremate her.

This morning, I found out that he got approved for a loan. Idk for sure if he's accepted it. Idk the interest rate. 

I felt like I couldn't let my dad go through with a loan for a funeral. I had a talk with him. I did my very best to be respectful. Here are the paraphrased highlights of the convo I had with him:

* $15k is a lot for a loan
* You still have to live with that debt
* Your mortgage is kinda high (at least $1500, prob more)
* Your car payments are high (at least $500 each for the two cars)
* You still have 2 dependent kids at home
* You still have to save for retirement
* You never know when you could lose your job again
* Insurance and taxes are always increasing
* You may be paying your bills now but you don't want a bunch of more bills
* You've only been on vacation once in your adult life
* You can honor Grandma without debt
* Putting money in a hole is not honoring her
* I cannot guarantee that you will be buried too
* I offered $3k of my own money to help out 
* We need to look for options within a $13k budget
* Whether that's cremate and have a good funeral or bury and figure out other funeral possibilities
* Do not go into debt for a funeral

Did I do the right thing?",Asshole,2024-05-13,"AITA for telling my dad to burn his mom? Gonna keep this as straightforward as possible. Yes, the title is clickbait-y but I need y'all to engage with this post. 

Relevant Players: Dad (50sM), Me (20sF), and Grandma (70sF) 

  
Grandma was sick for years (dementia) but Dad did not make arrangements for her death. He acknowledges this and regrets this, and wishes he would have but didn't want to accept her death. He says that she has always told him that she does not want to be cremated.

Now she has died and the life insurance payout is $10K. 

General Breakdown of Expected Funeral Costs for What He Wants to Give Her: 

* Funeral: $8200 
* Casket: $7600 
* Burial Plot: $6000 
* Other Cemetery Cost: $3500 

Total: Approx $25K

So far, he hasn't wanted to budge on any of the expenses. Buying our own casket helps out some but breaks up the funeral home package. We don't know much about buying a plot via a website/non-funeral home to rely on that for budgeting. He does not want to cremate her.

This morning, I found out that he got approved for a loan. Idk for sure if he's accepted it. Idk the interest rate. 

I felt like I couldn't let my dad go through with a loan for a funeral. I had a talk with him. I did my very best to be respectful. Here are the paraphrased highlights of the convo I had with him:

* $15k is a lot for a loan
* You still have to live with that debt
* Your mortgage is kinda high (at least $1500, prob more)
* Your car payments are high (at least $500 each for the two cars)
* You still have 2 dependent kids at home
* You still have to save for retirement
* You never know when you could lose your job again
* Insurance and taxes are always increasing
* You may be paying your bills now but you don't want a bunch of more bills
* You've only been on vacation once in your adult life
* You can honor Grandma without debt
* Putting money in a hole is not honoring her
* I cannot guarantee that you will be buried too
* I offered $3k of my own money to help out 
* We need to look for options within a $13k budget
* Whether that's cremate and have a good funeral or bury and figure out other funeral possibilities
* Do not go into debt for a funeral

93,1cr5smb,AITA for not wishing my dad's finace a happy mothers day after they both left my graduation early the day before ,"Hi sorry if this is long but I am just so confused

For context my parents are divorced and my mother and I are estranged. My dad recently (3 years ago) started dating a new woman who has four children her daughters were not very welcoming to me but eventually started to be nice. My dad and I used to be really close but over the course of uni and him and her dating we have drifted apart. My graduation was a big deal to me because I graduated with two bachelors degrees and finished in three years. My dad's girlfriend's daughter was also graduating this weekend with her associates but decided not to go to her ceremony (we are the same age and friendly I thought) I will call her sally for the sake of the story.

I was getting ready for graduation and knew that my dad and brother did not wanted to sit through the whole ceremony (which only lasted 1.5 hours total). I asked how I was supposed to get home and he replied to me I should Uber and I replied and said or you guys could just stay. He said they were planning on leaving to change their clothes and they would pick me up after graduation. My boyfriend was the only one who stayed and I was so thankful for him but couldn't help but burst into tears.\*I later learned that they had left to ""change their clothes"" but were at the bar with sally's boyfriend's family\* After the ceremony I had to walk over to the football stadium parking lot and wait for 25 min for him to come pick me up. I got in the car and was upset my older brother (27) asked why I was upset I tearfully said ""I'm sad that you left my graduation"" he turned around and scoffed. In the car it was me, my dad, my dad's girlfriend, my boyfriend, and my brother I told them all I am just sad because I wanted to walk up the stairs after graduation and see everyone and feel celebrated and my dad looked at me in the rear view mirror and said to me ""sorry I am not good enough for you"". I broke down and said nothing else they just dropped me and my boyfriend off at my house while they went to the store.

We had planned before to have a party at my college house with my roommate's family (she is my best friend), they came back from the store and said nothing to me about what had happened. Rather they continued on like nothing happened and lowkey excluded me and my boyfriend. No one came to check on me and no one told me to my face they were so proud of me.

I am very confused because that is not how my dad is. He is really bad about sharing his emotions but I know that. He is the same man who used to come to all of my sports games in high school straight from work. He used to get me a card and flowers when I was in the talent show. Now I have no photos with my family from graduation, my family didn't give me a gift or a card. Which is not normal because my older brother got very nice graduation gifts for high school and college. I spent the rest of the day with my roommates family who all brought me cards.

Has anyone had a similar experience?

\*Edit After going to therapy and talking with my roommate who knows the situation here is what I may have concluded. My dad totally knows that he messed up bc he called me bc I am moving home next week. He asked if I would be willing to go to therapy with him which might be the best thing. As for his gf, I think that she got in his ear and her daughter wanted to leave and have everyone go with her to the bar (which like girl bye that is my dad not yours you and your mom can go separately I was quite literally graduating!!!). I think his gf might be jealous because before her my dad and I had a great relationship I think she really clouded his judgement.

95,1cr5gj8,AITA for confronting my mother after she lied to me on Mother's Day? ,"I 20F tried to do something for my mother on Mother's Day. Nothing big just a home cooked meal along with her favorite dessert and flowers at my place. I share the place with two roommates. She didn't show up and didn't even call to let me know that she wouldn't.

I called her and the reason she didn't come was that she woke up not feeling good and it slipped her mind to text me. If you're wondering why I didn't do something for her at her house it's because I can't go there. Her husband kicked me out three years ago and I never went back because we still don't talk.

Later  my brother posted a picture of him and his little family celebrating Mother's Day with my mother in the middle (at her house). I felt hurt because she could've just let me know that she wouldn't come so I could do something else or at least spare 1 hour for me.

I'll just put myself out there and give you some context. 17-19 I was in a bad place. I did a lot of messed up things. I dropped out of school. I used to drink and smoke a lot. I got pregnant at 17 and miscarried (this was when her husband kicked me out because I didn't make it easy for them to help me. It was too much for them). I had an abortion when I was 18. I got wasted and ended up being taken advantage of at a party and that was the wake up call for me. I could go on for an hour about the mistakes I made. She was ashamed to have a daughter like me but she did help me get through it financially. I accepted all the help I got and tried to work on myself. I have a job now and have been sober for 9 months. I apologized to her a lot and I still apologize to her sometimes.

Back to Mother's Day. I said nothing but called her today and asked her why she lied to me. Her response was ""You did a lot of lying before and I never asked why. Did I"" I tried to keep calm because to this day she still reminds me of my past mistakes that I'm trying hard to forget about and improve from. I asked her if she wants nothing to do with me then she could just be honest with me and I would never bother her again because I really felt like she's been trying to avoid me lately. Her response was ""After all I did for you and here you are still acting like I'm the one in the wrong. I hope every time you look into my eyes you feel that I deserve a better child"" I know I shouldn't have said this but I told her that I would never feel such a thing because I'm never near her again to look into her eyes to begin with.

I called again to apologize and she's not answering my calls. I don't know if I went too far but I really didn't mean going NC. I was just angry at the way she talked to me.

If someone went through a similar situation how can I prove to my mother that I've changed? How can I gain her trust back? I don't even remember the last time we hugged.

Our only rule was that he needed to have a job. He had issues keeping a job in the past so we knew we had to make that known right away. He did not get a job by the time they had to move in. My husband (her stepdad) was not happy. It took him a while to find a job and he never kept one for long. At one point I gave him a two week deadline and when he still wasn’t working I told them he had to go. He found a job that day and we decided to give him another chance. I cut their rent in half in exchange for her watching her siblings before and after school and to help keep the house clean. I only wanted the dishes done daily and the house generally picked up. She initially agreed but began not holding up her end of the deal. She stayed in the basement only coming up to tell her siblings to clean the house. She was having them do her chores. A few weeks ago, they decided that they were going to stay the night at his parents house and take the dog with them. While they were there, something happened to the dogs back legs and they needed to get him pet insurance to take him to the vet. She didn’t have the money so she asked a few people to borrow it. They got the money from his brother, however they never ended up going to the vet because the insurance wasn’t immediate. So they stayed at his parents house for 9 days and her boyfriend had taken the entire time off work to care for the dog. Which confused me because there wasn’t anything they could do for him.

98,1cr547x,AITA for wanting to spend Christmas with my out-of-state siblings who will be in town? ,"My wife and I usually split our holidays between her local family and mine (my siblings all live out of state). However, this Christmas all my siblings, along with their spouses and kids, will be in town. My wife insists we follow the tradition of spending Christmas morning with my parents and then heading to her father’s by noon, despite my family's rare reunion.

My wife is strict about adhering to her father's ""***rule***"" that all his children gather at his house by noon. He tends to spoil her and her sisters with lavish gifts, making it a significant event for her. Our families have different gift-opening styles (they open ""all at once"" while my family does rounds/takes turns), which adds to the contrast.

Given the rarity of having all my siblings and their kids together, I see this Christmas as a possibly unique opportunity for a full family gathering. I'd like more flexibility from my wife to balance time between both families. When we discussed this, the conversation became heated, and she insisted on sticking to the noon plan at her father's.

We both hope to eventually have a quiet Christmas at our home with our son, but our parents' demands make this difficult. I suggested a compromise: start at our house, visit her father's at noon, and reunite with my family in the evening. I need advice on creating a fair plan that satisfies both our desires to see our families this Christmas.

  
AITA for wanting to change things up this year? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-13,"AITA for wanting to spend Christmas with my out-of-state siblings who will be in town?  My wife and I usually split our holidays between her local family and mine (my siblings all live out of state). However, this Christmas all my siblings, along with their spouses and kids, will be in town. My wife insists we follow the tradition of spending Christmas morning with my parents and then heading to her father’s by noon, despite my family's rare reunion.

My wife is strict about adhering to her father's ""***rule***"" that all his children gather at his house by noon. He tends to spoil her and her sisters with lavish gifts, making it a significant event for her. Our families have different gift-opening styles (they open ""all at once"" while my family does rounds/takes turns), which adds to the contrast.

Given the rarity of having all my siblings and their kids together, I see this Christmas as a possibly unique opportunity for a full family gathering. I'd like more flexibility from my wife to balance time between both families. When we discussed this, the conversation became heated, and she insisted on sticking to the noon plan at her father's.

He was eating sunflower seeds at 1 am, and I began to go sleep on the couch, but after a min of laying out there i felt I should be the one in bed since I wanted to sleep and not the person that wants to eat. So I came back in to the room, and sat up with him. I said I felt he should go out on the couch since he was eating. He earlier that night said he wanted to go to bed early, as he was leaving I asked him if he was still trying to go to bed early. He said hes already up now and slammed the door. I fall asleep but our roomate leaves around 330 AM for work and this woke me up. I noticed my bf was still on the couch and likely was also awoken when our roomate left through the kitchen which is next to the living room where he was laying down. I got up to see if he was awake to see if he wanted to lay in the bed. I lightly tried to touch his arm and see if he was awake, he didnt answer so I left him alone and went back to bed. This morning, he goes to a work meeting around 9 and moved back in the bed, I was in the bathroom getting ready for work, I say good morning and asked him if he was upset. He claims I threw a fit last night for him keeping me up and stated I have headphones and an eye mask and I should of just worn those. Then claimed I was being selfish by trying to wake him up at 330, stating that I already had the bed and shouldnt have checked on him. He said he was awake and pretended to be asleep cause he was so mad at me. During this conversation he started yelling and raising his voice at me, and Im not trying to fight with him. I felt that when I left around 1 am that I was trying to be constructive and realistic as the person who wants to eat shouldnt be in the bed. Weve fought about this before and we agreed that 1 am should be the cut off for lights out. 

  
For context, he was eating sunflower seeds, with a spit cup. He also has ADD and tends to shake his leg without realizing he is doing this, along with having his phone on full brightness. I am a light sleeper and he knows this, which is why I have the eye masks.  We both work from home too, so he has penty of time to sleep during the day during his lunch and between meetings. 

  
So AITA for thinking thats unaccepatble and feel like he doesnt respect my needs for sleep?

100,1cr4wa4,AITA for putting my husband’s health over his mother’s feelings?,"My husband has been having some health issues relating to work and stress so he’s been trying to take it easy and do everything he can do de-stress and have a work life balance. He works in high-level finance with literally no work life balance ( > 100 hours work week), a lot of people in this industry have heart problems and some have died on the desk. We know that we choose this lifestyle ourselves but that’s why we have been really conscious about doing everything we can in order to be healthy.

We decided to go on a short spa trip on Mother’s Day weekend (Sat-Sun) because it was looking like he would have some downtime (usually he has to work on weekends and our schedules are very unexpected and flexible, like something could come up with work at 2PM on a Saturday, so we want to take advantage of a weekend would more likely be less busy). 

The plan was for my husband to meet up with his mom after we get back from the spa (around noon on Sunday). However the spa was fully booked on Sat (we could not book early because we usually book stuff the day of so we’re sure we can make it to things), the earliest availability was around noon on Sunday, and my husband really wanted to have a massage to de-stress and he felt like he really needed this, otherwise we would have gone to the spa resort without getting any treatments.

My MIL is a very sensitive person and tends to put a lot of weight on holidays, she needs to have certain days which are considered “her days” with all eyes on her, even if the world is falling down. My husband was hesistant to ask his mom if he could come see her a little bit later around 2 PM instead of noon, because she usually throws a tantrum if things don’t go her ways. However I encouraged him to tell her the truth and explained that he wanted to get the massage, then come see her. (it’s like a 2.5 hour drive from the spa resort) I know that he really needed that and want him to have an hour of relaxation before heading back to our crazy lives.

We have had open convos about our jobs / schedules and how everyone needs to be more flexible with seeing each other, we’re still gonna see them it’s just that sometimes plans might change. She just takes these things very personally and she thinks that it is a disrespect to her, even tho we’re trying really hard to juggle between jobs / our own lives / external family. 

As a result his mom freaked out and uninvited him altogether. He said if you’re not okay with that, you can just tell me and I won’t go to the spa, no need for a tantrum. However it just got worse she would not even let him drop off his gift to her. She then invited someone else to come to the meal so that there won’t be a seat for him. His dad also told him to back off. So he went ahead to get the massage and ended up not coming. That night he sent her a text basically saying happy mother’s day i love you etc. No response and the next morning received a nasty text from his dad calling him words again, saying that that’s not an apology and basically not enough.

As a partner I’m just heartbroken to see the way my husband is being treated because he is really a sweet person to his family, he was basically his mom’s rock growing up and she probably feels like she lost him to me or the world or whatever. He still tries to show up to family events despite having a busy schedule, we live 2 hours away so even though sometimes we’re not on time, we still make the effort to show up. (His family has a problem with this and to them we’re not putting in any effort) He calls his family once a week, like I cannot think of a time that he has been a bad son to them, he helped them with their mortgage, listened to their problems etc. 

I know they do not understand our lifestyles but what we really need is sympathy and support from the family. We get that people’s feelings might be hurt, but as family do we have to use the nuclear option to exclude your own son over something that could easily be solved with communications and not tantrums?

For the purpose of this story I will call them my adoptive family. Both had adult children when I was growing up, none of whom I necessarily liked, but my adoptive father’s kid was around way more since he lived in the same area. I never liked him growing up and that trend has not changed much since I’ve grown up. To put it simply, I saw/heard all the arguments, the name calling, and just general meanness involving this person and their parents. Add to the fact that he thought he could “parent” me in any way, even though the relationship should’ve been that of an older brother, which over the years has garnered more resentment. As a  child I was forced to integrate this person and their family into my life. Any time we traveled included him and his family, any time we went out to a restaurant, any time spent outside of our home, etc. so there was no real escape. As an adult I want nothing to do with any of the negativity, to the point I made sure it’s known not to call anyone visiting my house with that type of behavior. In recent years though, that has caused more issues as I’ve been vocal about my dislike for certain actions. The response from them has been “we don’t have that kind of relationship”.


My College graduation is in a few months and they are living in the same city that it is being held in. I do not want them there. I feel like if I can’t call my “family” out for their actions and we don’t have that kind of relationship, why should they be able to celebrate any of my accomplishments with me.

I ask him if he is still open, and he hesitantly says yes, but ask us if it’s to go, I say yes as I don’t want to be that annoying customer staying until closing time. My dad cuts me off and says no, we will dine in, and the poor guy says I can give you paper plates I guess, and I am feeling very uncomfortable as we are in a city with DOZENS of restaurants within a 5 minute drive from us. 

Then we get to ordering. We are ordering at the counter, and my dad wants to share a pizza with me, and we agree to each pick half of the pizza that we both like, and we will grab a slice from each. My father, who I think knows me quite well, orders literally the only pizza type I hate, which is pineapple for his side, and I said, “really?” And he said “just try it it’s really good, as if I’ve never had it before lol. I just was like whatever, and order one we both like for the other side. After the guy took our order, my dad felt bad for me I guess, and said “you know what, let’s do the chicken” which was nice, because that’s something I really like, but he kept complaining about switching for the next 10 minutes, I would not have said anything else about the pineapple, nor did I ask him to switch.

Then, my dad wants to order a drink. He starts asking the poor guy what his beer recommendations are, and which ones are local. This kid is probably 16 years old, has school tomorrow, wants to go home, and my dad is asking him about beer recommendations 15 minutes before they close.

We sit down, and I express all this frustration to him, and he gets furious at me, and refuses to talk to me the rest of the trip. AITAH?

My dad and I (22M) were driving back from a camping trip to the city after a long day of hiking, and our arrival time was expected to be about 9:45pm. I was driving back, which was about a 3 hour drive, and we agreed on going out to get pizza in the city and that he would find a restaurant that was open and looked good. There were plenty of options available for restaurants, but he picked this particular place that looked good, but had a closing time of 10pm(I did not know this at the time as I was driving).

109,1cr3vhw,AITA for wanting NC with my boyfriends sister? ,"Me (26F) and my boyfriend of 9 years (27M) are struggling with the contact with his sister. 

My bf and his sister (31F) were already low on contact. Since she moved out of their parents' house in 2017 she never looked back. Only for birthdays or the holidays she shows up. She only contacts her parents when she needs them. 

In 2022 she got married and we helped them a lot with preparations and during the wedding. During preparations, we had a disagreement with her husbands' family, but during the wedding we all acted normal towards eachother. We tried to clear the air but they didn't want to. After this, there was a tension between all of us that only got worse over time. 

When my mom got her cancer diagnosis in 2022, the first time I saw my her was at her husbands birthday. I told her that I would tell her the results of the hospital another time. I didn't think that that was the best time to talk about it (because I wasn't comfortable talking about it at a crowded birthday party). She took it really bad and hasn't forgiven me for that since then. She told me she gave me my chance to talk about it but if I didn't want to, she didn't care and didn't want to know at all. She never asked about it again. I was hurt, but still I kept sending her updates about my mom, because I thought that that was the right thing to do. 

When my mom was sick and after she died, I never got any messages about how I was doing, nor did my bf. They never ever messaged or called. When they heard through my bf's mother that I started working again after the loss, she send me a message about how it was being back at work. I was so confused and mad about this that I never answered. I couldn't understand why she never cared before and now she wanted to know how things were at work. 

After this, things got worse. When we saw eachother at birthdays or during christmas, they wouldn't even say hi to us. When she got pregnant, she called us and we were happy for them, went to the gender reveal party etc. When our niece was born we went to visit and they acted normal, but after that it was the same as before. When our niece was baptised, my bf was asked to be godfather. During the baptism-party, we were ignored by them again (my bf's parents were too). 

In april, my bf and I bought our first house together. He told his sister but she couldn't be bothered at all. She just ignored him. This hurts, because we were there for all their 'big moments' and every time something happens in our life, they can't even seem to bother. 

We decided that we're done with this and that we don't want them in our lives anymore. My bf tried to talk about all this, but his sister didn't believe that she was doing anything wrong and couldn't understand why we were hurt, so talking probably won't help.

I asked my husband if we could go. He said I should go and spend time with my grandmothers, and how his family is planning their own party as well. Now here is where I might be the asshole.

I asked him if he could please come with me. How my grandmothers really want to see him. That they prepared a lot of food and I know they will be sending us home with bags filled with leftovers because that's just how they are.

He was iffy on going. He said how his sister would be at the party with her three kids and he wanted to see them. I told him that I understood but that we are able to see his family all the time. No matter when, and how my grandmother drove an hour to be in the neighborhood. I also told him how we have spent every holiday with his family and that I wanted to spend this one with mine.

In the end he said okay and we had a wonderful time with my family. Ate a lot and this was the first family event he has been to from my side and finally saw why I myself tend to be a bit loud because everyone in mine is very talkative and loud. It was great.

But his mother was absolutely pissed that she didn't receive any gifts or a happy mother's day from her son. Because I know that with everything going on he had forgotten to send a happy mother's day to his mother. She's saying she's emotionally damaged and how her son has changed so much since getting with me.

Now I'm feeling guilty because I knew that she would be mad if we spent it with my family. i knew he would forget to send a message and I knew that this would hurt her. And yesterday i was kind of glad it did.

113,1cr3fso,AITA for locking the door?,"Sorry this is a throwaway account

My front door(s) has three locks. Two on the “screen door” (it’s not actually a screen - it’s just metal bars) and one on the main door. There’s one deadbolt, and two standard locks apart of the doorknobs.

Now the house is located in a pretty unsafe neighborhood/city. This city has been number one in the murder rate in my country for several years running. Although the number has diminished in recent years and we no longer hold the #1 spot, I’m still cautious of my surroundings. 

Ever since I moved in, about a month ago, I’ve kept the doors locked pretty much 24/7. And when I mean locked, I mean that all three locks are locked. This also includes the two locks on the back door. 

About a week ago, my mother comes to move in with me. We got into a disagreement regarding the back door being locked after she accidentally locked herself out. So we agreed that we would only lock the deadbolt & keep the doorknob unlocked so she can’t lock herself out. This applies to the back door only. This also doesn’t mean she locks the doors, but this just means she won’t complain when she tries to go outside and finds the door locked. I still have to go around and lock the doors before bed or whenever she leaves because she simply doesn’t lock them. 

A couple days later, we have a similar disagreement regarding the front door this time, where she insists it doesn’t need to be locked while we are home. I am not comfortable with this. I voice my concerns & we come to the agreement that we will only keep the deadbolt on the screen door locked when we are home and lock everything else when we are gone. 

Now here is where the issue arises. Today, I go out to walk the dogs & pick up a beverage from a local store and no one was home so I locked all three front door locks. I get home, and instantly my mom starts berating me about how she really had to pee & she can’t handle unlocking three locks every time she comes home. We get into a disagreement and I told her that I do not feel comfortable only using one lock when nobody is home, and I reminded her of the previous compromises and suggested that she use the back door when she really has to pee since it’s only that one lock. This all resulted in her insinuating that I can’t understand because I’m not a 55 year old women who can’t hold her bladder (she has no known medical conditions) and she’s not going around back (she didn’t give a valid reason as to why she wouldn’t use the back door.) For context, the driveway is on the side of the house so the distance to the front door versus the back door is minimal, if not easier because there’s no steps leading to the back door like there are with the front door. 

Basically we kept arguing until she started screaming that I’m being inconsiderate and to leave her alone. So I went to my room and wrote this. So Am I the Asshole for locking the door/insisting that we lock the doors when we leave? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-13,"AITA for locking the door? Sorry this is a throwaway account

So we agreed that we would only lock the deadbolt & keep the doorknob unlocked so she can’t lock herself out. This applies to the back door only. This also doesn’t mean she locks the doors, but this just means she won’t complain when she tries to go outside and finds the door locked. I still have to go around and lock the doors before bed or whenever she leaves because she simply doesn’t lock them. 

A couple days later, we have a similar disagreement regarding the front door this time, where she insists it doesn’t need to be locked while we are home. I am not comfortable with this. I voice my concerns & we come to the agreement that we will only keep the deadbolt on the screen door locked when we are home and lock everything else when we are gone. 

Now here is where the issue arises. Today, I go out to walk the dogs & pick up a beverage from a local store and no one was home so I locked all three front door locks. I get home, and instantly my mom starts berating me about how she really had to pee & she can’t handle unlocking three locks every time she comes home. We get into a disagreement and I told her that I do not feel comfortable only using one lock when nobody is home, and I reminded her of the previous compromises and suggested that she use the back door when she really has to pee since it’s only that one lock. This all resulted in her insinuating that I can’t understand because I’m not a 55 year old women who can’t hold her bladder (she has no known medical conditions) and she’s not going around back (she didn’t give a valid reason as to why she wouldn’t use the back door.) For context, the driveway is on the side of the house so the distance to the front door versus the back door is minimal, if not easier because there’s no steps leading to the back door like there are with the front door. 

Basically we kept arguing until she started screaming that I’m being inconsiderate and to leave her alone. So I went to my room and wrote this. So Am I the Asshole for locking the door/insisting that we lock the doors when we leave? ",0.0,0.017328016459941864,0,1
114,1cr36ap,AITA for not texting my friend on Mother’s Day to acknowledge her deceased mom after 7 years?,"Hi Reddit, I need some perspective here because I'm really torn about whether I'm in the wrong.

My friend (34F) and I (34F) have been friends for over 20 years. Her mom passed away in 2017, and understandably, it's been very tough on her. She has struggled with her grief, and from my perspective, she hasn't taken many steps towards healing, such as going to therapy, despite having several opportunities to do so. I understand everyone handles grief differently, but she often has many reasons for not seeking help. She does a lot of emotional dumping on me, because I am basically the only friend she has. This puts a lot of pressure on me, because I feel responsible for her well-being (even though that isn’t my responsibility). 

Every year, I've made it a point to acknowledge the anniversary of her mom's passing, her mom's birthday, and Mother's Day. I started this because my friend would preemptively tell me that she was going to be in a shitty mood on these days. 
However, this year, I didn't send a message on Mother's Day. Now, my friend is upset with me for not reaching out.

118,1cr2rv7,AITA on how I told my wife I’m concerned for her weight gain,"My wife is everything to me. When she came into my life she changed my life 180 degrees. Everything I’ve done I’ve done because she’s given me the will power to overcome any challenge, Liqour, Cigs, type 2 diabetes, going back to school. Recently she’s been talking about how much weight she’s gained. When we got married 3 years ago she weighed 130 pounds and now she’s pushing 200. In those 3 years she’s developed a lot of heath problems that’s had her in the hospital 100 days in 3 years. Type 1 diabetic, gastroperesis, HS, along with seizures. All of that has added a lot of new medication to her daily routine, including Amnitryptline. 

Last night she made another comment about her weight saying “I know I’m getting fatter because I can’t even cross my legs anymore”. So this morning I sent her a text that said

 “I just want to tell you and reassure you that I will love you in every season and every form you take. You are my girl, my partna, my sweet cheese. You looked beautiful to me 4 years ago and you look beautiful to me now, and in 60 years you will still look beautiful to me. 

But health wise, Do you think you should get your hormones or something checked out? I think it’s just odd that your diabetes is way better and it’s not like you eat huge meals 3 times a day or a lot of sugar but you are gaining weight and Kenny I want you to know this is not coming from a place of pride or “dang I wish my wife was smaller”. I love you and I want us both to live a long healthy life together. I love you so so so much.”

We were talking on the phone when I asked if she had seen my message and she said no and read it. She understandably started crying, saying she didn’t want to talk but kept me on the phone so I just listened to her cry for 30 minutes while trying to make her understand that was coming from a place of caring and not me shaming her. She said she would’ve liked me to say this to her face but I told i feel I’m able to say exactly what I want to say over text and take the time to think about what I text. Also in therapy she can show what exactly I said. 

Help my male lizard brain. 

POST EDIT: A mix of YTA NTAH and YTAH kind of. Thanks to everyone who commented something useful. A lot of you said she probably needed it face to face and physical touch for reassurance and I will keep that in my mind for the future hard conversations. I am just a man trying to learn how to better love his wife in this one life we get and as I put in here somewhere my therapist describes me as “good intentions, bad execution”.

My mother, who has always enabled her, is on my sisters side and condemned me for not putting aside my differences with my sister for one day. My father, on the other hand, is on my side and said that I'm a legal adult now and can do whatever I want. My friends are split between this issue. I'm conflicted.

126,1cr1q15,AITA For Reporting a Committee Member to a Board Member,"All of these names have been changed btw.

I (26F) am a member of a committee that runs a medieval festival that involves volunteer actors. The committee has been split up into five sections: Logistics, Advertising, Entertainment, Community Relations, and Site. Each section has a board member to over see the committee members, who have three members for each section. I am under the advertising director, the committee member in question is under entertainment.

The member in question, who I will name Jason (70M), has been in the festival since the start. Jason is very old schooled and will not budge with new ideas unless they benifit him. He seems to but heads with everyone else on the committee as well as in our cast.

The board has a deal with our town council that if we clean up the community centre gardens and the park we use, the cost to use the park will decrease. One day a year, we go and clean the two areas mentioned.

Saturday was our clean up day. We had just finished the community centre and made our way to the park. Jason is a touchy-feely kind of person. Concent is not in his vocabulary. He has grabbed my shoulder a few times in the past, but I keep my cool to avoid conflict. However, lines were crossed on Saturday.

I was approched by two cast members, Jamie (20NB) and Nickie (18NB). Everyone says I am the most trust worthy cast member as I understand boundaries (According to my friends) and all the younger cast members, especially the teenagers, trust me with any issues they have, in or out of the festival (Don't worry, I make sure lines aren't crossed). Nickie told me that Jason had grabbed Jamie by the shoulder. Jamie had PTSD from when they were living in a cult (They were raised in said cult) and asked Jason not to touch them and explained.

Jason said, word for word, ""You should of put that on your form."" Cue my best shocked Pikachu face. I knew Jason could be a bit of a boundary pusher, but that was not okay to say.

I sat there all Saturday night and all Sunday morning debating on whether or not I should report it. Finally, Sunday afternoon, I texted the director I trusted most, Kelly (26F), about the incident, leaving Jamie and Nickie's names out of it. I told Nickie about the report and they began freaking out on me, thinking their spots have been jeporedized. I tried to tell them they'd be okay as I left their names out of it, but they were pissed at me. Now I'm wondering if I've done the right thing.

To give you some context, my (future) MIL is extremely conservative. She doesn't think anyone should curse, drink, smoke, or be ""rowdy"". I don't really drink, definitely don't smoke, and I don't think I've ever been considered ""rowdy"". But I do swear, especially if I'm losing at videogames, or really frustrated.

Which brings me back to the present. Last weekend, my fiance took me to my favorite beach around late-evening. The sun hadn't set yet and he had planned a whole picnic for us. I was so relaxed and was completely enjoying myself. As soon as the sun set, music began playing and people walked in holding those globe-like lamps. It was a bunch of our friends and my and his family. Basically he had planned for them to come in as soon as it was darkish and he would then propose. While I turned in shock to see our people come onto the beach, he had got down on one knee.

Now here's where I screwed up (according to MIL). I freaked out when I saw him and I instantly wanted to jump out of my skin. I wasn't prepared for him to propose so soon (we had spoken about it but I didn't think it would happen now). As I freaked out, I loudly shouted ""WHAT THE F*CK!"" I honestly thought nothing of it and fell to my knees in tears.

Later on when we were at my family's house, a couple of friends, my MIL, FIL all had joined too. That's when MIL took me aside and warned me not to curse like that again. She said it wasn't a good look for a woman to curse and that I was embarssing her family. I had nothing to say to her because I was so shocked. It hadn't even registered that I cursed and I didn't think she would get so mad on one of the happiest day's of our lives.

I think my FIL must have known she was going to talk to me about this. And later he came to speak to me as well and told me that she was from another generation and that I should learn to have some respect for her wishes. I was extremely bad but also wondered if I was wrong. Because technically my fiance doesn't curse or do any of the above ""no-no"" things infront of his parents.

She is very hard working and single handedly takes care of entire household. she used to work couple of years back and due to some issue in my hometown we all had to go and work from there(remotely). Nobody liked her working and indirectly used to budge her for why its required for her to work, so I feel guilty because of my family and relatives, she missed a chance in getting promotion and ultimately she had a fallout from her manager because of how hard she worked and still didn't get considered for promotion and instead the manager chose someone he knew, so finally she quit.

we had a baby and ever since she has been a housewife. and now after couple of years she feels like creating her own youtube channel and follow her dreams of growing in that path but there are always some or the other judgement and feeling of discomfort to achieve that goal while staying with our parents.

My husband (20M) and I (23F)met over a year and a half ago, and have been inseparable since and got married last month. 

I had my reservations about him initially as I was concerned that being younger he would have different priorities etc to me but so far that has not proven to be an issue. We rarely ever argue, and we have not had a single big argument up until now.

To add some context, he is in the army and often has to travel for work and be away for periods of time, this doesn’t bother me! 

Two years ago he booked to go on a rugby tour with his rugby team to Italy but it got delayed for various reasons. This was all paid for upfront and before he knew me. 

In November last year he said he really wanted to try for a baby, and whilst this is something I definitely wanted, I was concerned about timing but he was adamant it would all be fine and he understood what he would have to sacrifice becoming a parent.

Now I fell pregnant in January and since then I have made it clear I feel really uncomfortable about him going to Italy. I have been quite unwell throughout my pregnancy with bleeds, high blood pressure and a growth in my uterus, so I am absolutely terrified of being on my own and I don’t have a huge support network. If anything was to happen whilst he was away, it could mean days before he is even back here!

He has completely disregarded my feelings on this and is excusing this by saying I paid for it and booked it before I even knew you. 

Now he has flown out there today whilst I am 18 weeks pregnant and has completely ignored my protests and is expecting me to just act normal with him?

133,1cr0yiz,AITA for leaving my 15 year old daughter on the bus?,"I (41 female) have a 15 year old daughter, let’s call her Beth, with my husband. On the weekends/ after work during the week primarily use public transportation.

 Most of the time Beth rides with us on the bus she refuses to sit next to us (in normal teenage fashion) and prefers to sit as far away from us as possible. She also  has a bad habit of putting earphones in and zoning out, not paying attention to our bus stop so my husband and I have to squeeze through the packed bus and get her attention so she gets off the bus with us. We’ve had talks with her about how dangerous it is to be completely unaware of your surroundings especially on a public bus but she refuses to pay attention to the bus stops or sit closer to us so we can easily get her attention. 

  Additionally, she has been asking us for more freedom. She wants to spend a pay check on her own buss pass, which we are seriously considering for certain bus routes at certain times but we are hesitant due to the fact that she doesn’t not pay attention which could easily become a problem.

That brings us to Saturday, when we got on the bus Beth chose to sit in the very back while I sat at the front. The bus was unusually empty that day and I got an idea. The next bus stop was the stop in front of our house and I exited the bus but Beth did not (she wasn’t paying any attention) immediately after I booked it down the road to the next stop (the bus terminal) and met the bus there. I was prepared to board again to get her but she exited. 

She was  angry, saying that I had abandoned her on the bus and that she was terrified when she looked up and didn’t see me there. I apologized for scaring her but explained how dangerous it is to not pay any attention to what’s going on around you. I told my husband  at home and he agreed that it was a justified lesson to teach. When  Beth went to her grandparents house (my parents) and told them and a few of my sisters about the incident called me and asshole. 
Our side: 
 Beth wants her own city buss pass but when we ride with her we have issues getting her to pay attention and stick with us. I left her on the bus at the second to last stop of a bus route that I knew was guaranteed to stop at the terminal and booked it there, she was not alone for more than 4 minutes on a bus that had very few people on it and I was pretty confident she would get off at the stop (as it’s our usual) This was a last resort after me and my husband  have had several talks about being safe in public and being responsible. 

My daughter/ parents/ sisters side:
I left my young daughter on a public bus by herself and did not tell her  she was going to be alone. It was cruel to punish her by leaving I should have resorted to other methods that did not involve me getting off the bus without her. Anything could have happened in the 4 minutes she was alone and it was completely irresponsible to leave her.

I need advice… I would ask my boyfriend or my other bestie, but I want something completely unbiased. I will let you know since it is my main account, and not a throw away some of the ages & names will be changed (not to the point that it isn't accurate to the question), but It will remain true to the story. 

So, I (28F) have a best friend, Celine (26F) who is dating a man, Rakim (38M), and I think... They’re moving way too fast. So, they met about two months ago, and now, they’re dating. Which I don’t mind. Okay, I lied. I kind of mind just because he’s already talking about marriage and having children. Which to me is an instant red flag. 

Let me explain, Celine just got out of a long-term relationship that was pretty abusive, and what that relationship has in common with this one is, that they moved pretty quickly. Her ex moved in less than a month of them knowing each other. 

Now, here’s why I’m very skeptical of the new relationship. As many people pointed out, the age gap. They’re twelve years apart in age, and someone explained to me, nobody that age would date my friend if they had their shit together. Which, I honestly, agree. 

Celine currently lives with her aunt, and has lost custody of her children. 

So, here’s where I’m feeling like an asshole. 

So Celine told me recently that the condom had broken and she was late on her period. I asked… Did she at least take a plan b? She told me, No. Now granted, Plan B's are not 100% affective, it's still the matter of her trying to stop the pregnancy, so she can get her life back in order.

Now, Celine and Rakim have a date coming up and I fear she might make another bad decision, but I know she won't tell me until it's too late since I already voiced my opinion on the current relationship.

 I feel like she’s blinded by the good times to see that things are going way too fast, and before you argue, there have been relationships that moved way too fast, and the outcome was great, but my question to you is… How common is that? 

So, am I the asshole for not being happy for my best friend's new relationship?

We live in Georgia so my parents don’t want me working in the summer heat. 

Summer is coming up, and my Mom told me recently that I would be working for him this week. I told her that I didn’t want to work for my dad anymore, and that’s for a few reasons. First, I don’t get paid. I’ve probably done hundreds of hours of work at this point and still do not get paid. My dad paid me for half of one summer ($4/hour) before stopping without explanation. I just can’t justify spending so much of my time and adjusting my sleep schedule to wake up early without getting any compensation. Second, I don’t like doing the job. It’s not an enjoyable experience and I’d much rather just find another summer job.

Anyway, we drive up for an hour to somewhere dark and remote, and after being parked up for half an hour, we see the aurora borealis.

141,1cqzixr,AITA for celebrating Mother’s Day with my mom and not staying home with my wife ,"Their is some background to this. My wife and my mother do not get along well. It is due to their personalities. My wife is very gentle hearted while my mother is more get shit done.

There have been multiple times that my wife ended up in tears from really small things. Sometimes it has been things that the other DILs have been confused on. It doesn’t help that other women in the family have taken steps back due to this. One example is that my wife started crying after a story from when mom worked in the hospital. It really wasn’t sad but she started crying in the middle.  I was here for this one and I made me realize what the other women in the family were saying. 


My sister for example explained that she doesn’t want to walk on eggshells with my wife or she may end up crying. My mom has taken a step back since she is tired of being the bad guy and causing her to cry when she didn’t do anything  

She is in therapy for this and it has helped a lot. She has better control over her emotions and got a diagnosis. 

The main problem, we do not have kids. Mother’s Day was yesterday so I went over to give her a gift and have dinner. I invited my wife but she declined.

I got home and she was pissed for leaving her one alone on Mother’s Day. My point is that she isn’t a parent and her point was I need to be more considerate. I can’t ask people I know since they are bias so I came here.

142,1cqzbrv,AITA for being annoyed at my best friend for acting ungrateful even though I think she’s in a bad place? ,"My best friend and I have been close since school so for around 10 years now, we’ve seen eachother through a couple of awful relationships, been in single girl phases and spent pretty much every weekend together. Until we both got into relationships again, we don’t see eachother as much anymore which is fine we’re both busy. 

Unfortunately my friend was coerced to move in with her long term boyfriend, as his tenancy was coming to an end and he insisted she joined him on his next one, and if she didn’t he’d of been really upset. This is now a theme in their relationship, they live together and spend every weekend together, and eat dinner together every night. They don’t have friends over to their place, he has had a tantrum when she said I was coming over for lunch and he refused to let me come as it was ‘messy’. 

He also gets annoyed at her whenever she makes plans with me (maybe once every month) because HE wanted to have plans with her on that day too. I’ve noticed her become a shell of herself, she doesn’t take care in her appearance like she used to. She doesn’t seem happy when we meet up and he’s just smothered her entire life outside of work. I thought maybe the change was just because she’s settled down, but the stories she tells me of him getting annoyed at her for making plans with me just make me think differently…

So she fought her corner and said I don’t care if you’re annoyed at me, I want to see my friend and have a day out so I’m going to do that. We went on a road trip, I drove there and back probably around 100 miles round trip. I didn’t ask for fuel money, and I didn’t ask for money for the car park when we were there. But she didn’t even give me a ‘thank you’ or offer to contribute anything towards fuel or parking. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I also hate the situation she’s in with her relationship. It’s making me not feel so loving towards her, the fact she was ungrateful and not helpful, and the fact she’s losing her personality, and not doing anything about the blood sucking man in her life.

144,1cqyzj9,AITA for refusing to eat what my gf's mother made for us?,"Just for some quick context. Both me and my gf have Caribbean ancestry. The main difference between us is that she embraces her heritage and I don't. Growing up my gf had a lot of Guyanese food that her mom would make and her mom would often times give us a lot of the food she cooks. Something else I have to mention as well is that I have arfid. My gf and her mom know this.

Anyways, on Saturday I cooked us 7 days worth of food and I was very proud of what I made. My girlfriend's mom came over on Sunday to spend Mother's Day with us and she brought this dish she made. Honestly looking at it I knew right away I wasn't going to like it. It was okra submerged in what looked like a very thick viscous white soup. I didn't ask what it was called but it's something my gf has had a few times. 

We sat down to dinner and I put out my food and my gf's mom's food. During dinner my gf was trying to get me to try her moms food. Not wanting to be rude I told her I'd try it. I put a spoonful in my mouth and it was probably one of the most fowl things I had ever put in my mouth. I made sure to get as much okra as I could just so I could have something to chew but it didn't help much. My gf looked at her mom and said ""he doesn't like it"" and I just said ""I just don't think it's for me"". My gf's mom was cool about it and my gf told me that I should try it with the food I made. I told her that I didn't want to do it and her mom said I'd probably like it a bit more if I combined the food together. Again to be nice I tried it with a spoonful of my food and hers and it was still the same. Her mom said ""well at least you tried"".

This morning as my gf was getting ready for work she told me that what I did last night was rude. I asked her what I did wrong. She told me that when a guest brings food to your house it is complimentary to eat their food and not your own. I was also making faces (I didn't know I was doing this) that made it look like I was in pain eating her mom's food. Lastly she told me I insulted her culture doing that. I asked her what she expected me to do. I tried it, didn't like it and got pressured into trying more. If I don't like something I'm not going to like it. She then told me that my parents didn't do me any favors by keeping me from my cultural food. I got really mad that she did a dig at me and my parents like that and I told her to get out and I wouldn't be talking to her for the rest of the day. I knew I was going to do some tit for tat but I know it's not conducive to a healthy relationship.

146,1cqytm3,AITA? Asking my (now ex) bf to wash his hair before bed,"So this might be silly of me to even make a post when my ex and I aren’t even together anymore, but it was a very small disagreement which we had never settled on. When my ex (m24)and I (f24) were together, we dated for about 7-8 months. He lived about 30 minutes away, so he’d usually sleep over when he was hanging out with me till late since it’s not always safe to drive in our town past midnight with drunk college students driving. He has short, very curly hair which he only washes once a week. I have diagnosed OCD (he knew this) and I am religious about keeping my bed clean. I shower every single night and wash my hair every night. I don’t let people sit on my bed with their outside clothes on because I can’t stand the idea of any germs getting on my clean bed. I have silk sheets and pillowcases which I keep very clean. My hair gets greasy super easily, like it gets greasy at the end of every day, so that’s why I wash my hair before bed in order to wake up with clean hair and not have greasy residue on my pillowcases (it also makes my skin break out). After a few months of being together, I politely asked my ex if he could start washing his hair on the nights that he slept over, because it really bothered me when he wouldn’t and his dirty hair would rub against my pillows and sheets. He was a little bothered by this and said that he couldn’t wash it every day because that’s not how you wash curly hair. I have straight hair so I couldn’t relate. I told him I understood, but that it really bothered me and my condition and that it would stress me out every time he slept over because I’d have to constantly wash my bedding. For more context, he told me his hair didn’t get dirty that much and it wasn’t greasy, but almost every time I’d play with his hair and run my fingers through it, it was anywhere from mildly to extremely greasy, and he also constantly had dandruff that would fall everywhere and you could see it on his shirt. He tried to compromise by bringing shampoo and conditioner to keep in my shower, but he would still only wash once a week. I ended up just having to be okay with it, because he refused to wash his hair more than once, and the only other alternative was for him to sleep over less, which seemed a bit dramatic on both ends. He slept over at least three times a week every week until we broke up, and it always bothered me but I didn’t bring it up again.
I guess I’m just wondering if I was too uptight and needed to learn to be okay with it, or if my feelings were justified? 

Edit: I wanted to add in that he lifted weights 5x a week and would get somewhat sweaty, sit on gym equipment, etc. We also live at the beach where it’s hot and humid and things in the air stick to your hair.

She moved there last August with her boyfriend, whom neither my boyfriend or I like. He's not a horrible guy, but he treats her kinda badly, and he's not the most courteous. (I.e. before my BF and I lived together, when I would come over ((planned)), her BF would be sitting in the living room with only his underwear on, playing video games. If that doesn't tell you the character of this guy, I don't know what will).

His mom will stick up tooth and nail for this guy, and one thing that he does that she tries to convince us to tolerate is smoking a certain substance. Which is legal where we live, illegal where they live. He smokes heavily, usually a room he's in is very thick with smoke, and while I don't mind what people do, I have asthma, and I do have an inhaler, but it's a rescue inhaler, so I'm not supposed to be using it like a breathing machine.

We've established several times, due to my asthma and easily triggered headaches, and a mutual distaste for the smell, we don't tolerate smoking in our apartment, and each time they visit, they ignore this. They don't care, and they smoke anyway.

Since we're going to visit and we're spending the night, I'm not going to ban them from smoking in their own home. I don't care what they do there. However, I also don't want to sleep in a place I can't breathe.

I told my boyfriend that I would be bringing a pillow and a blanket with me to keep in my car in case it's too smoky and I find it difficult to sleep without using my inhaler. I can't be waking up to use it every hour. Especially when I'm the one driving, I'm going to be tired, and I need to sleep so I can safely drive us 6.5hrs there and back home.

I thought this was justified, as he usually agrees with me on their heavy smoking being borderline obsessive. But my boyfriend says I'm being rude and inconsiderate. He says I should suck it up and deal with it because it's his mom. 

Aita for bringing a blanket and pillow just in case it's too much?

Edit #1: my bf does in fact care about my health, he just thinks my wanting to sleep elsewhere is rude. He's the one who encouraged me to get my asthma diagnosed. I'm not breaking up with him over this, I just wanted to know what the consensus was.
I will agree that his mom and her bf are a problem, as they both smoke so much I don't know that i can safely say I've had a conversation with either of them without them being high.

The mom came stomping out to their deflated two-story water slide they were playing on earlier and started yelling at my  6 y/o for breaking their slide.

At the same time, my phone number has not changed in almost 20 years and I have never removed them from my FB contacts, so they have always been able to reach me.

In short, we are not close, but it's not like it's been years since my last contact with them.

I found out from a FB post last night my dad had a stroke and was admitted to the hospital and later to ICU. No call, no message, nothing. I wasn't even tagged on the post.

It seems my sister didn't know, but both my brothers knew (which is its own can or two of worms).

I don't have redacted screenshots handy, and posting them as a comment is against guidelines as I understand them, but I genuinely want to know if IATA here (my husband, mom, closest friend, and sister say I'm not, but they have their own biases), so I have not left anything out to put myself in a better light.

Hey guys this is my first time making a post so sorry if this isn’t the correct forum to post this lol. 





So basically my boyfriend went out with friends after work and told me they were only gonna be out from 6-11 and to pick him up at 11. 11:40pm comes and he tells me to wait until he calls me to come get him because they are still hanging out. Almost 2 am i still haven’t heard anything prior to the last message at 11:40 so i asked him was there a change of plans which he responds that his friends will drop him off. 3 am rolls around and he’s still not here. I check in again and asked if i should just come before i go to bed for the night. Almost an hour goes past with no response so i fall asleep. I wake up at 5 am to a message from him saying his friend is sleeping but he still is taking him home. Upon seeing that i immediately start calling him and everyone he is with because i seen the message a hour later so i wanted to see what was going on since he isn’t here still. Nobody is picking up the phone at all so i decide to just drive over there. Which driving to the pickup location my boyfriend finally answers and says he was sleeping . At this point i’m extremely frustrated because i haven’t ate anything and it is now way too late to cook because i was waiting on him to be ready for me to pick up, they went to get food he didn’t even ask me if i was hungry or anything , and then when he finally gets in the car he’s mad at me because im mad at him ??? I literally had to get out my bed at 5am to come find this man all because his communication is terrible. I expressed to him that i’m frustrated at the fact that he basically had me sitting around waiting on him for hours and it felt like a big slap in the face he didn’t even say thank you for me coming to get him .

What am I supposed to do on your birthday? It's a celebration for me too having you reach (milestone)"". I informed her that she could come and we could have a nice dinner up there but she declined as she was not in any way interested in my hobby. I informed her it was a lovely area with a nice food scene and we could do that too so she and her partner had things to do but she wasn't interested. I compromised and agreed to come to her city instead and she was very happy, she asked what I wanted for dinner and I said tacos or something interesting. She then started insisting I invite childhood friends, it took me some time to explain that barring one or two I had no relationship with many of these people, nothing bad we just drifted apart. I eventually compromised and invited the son of her best friend and his wife and I was like fine whatever it's no big deal. My local friends however told me that due to the distance to my Mother's city they wouldn't be able to come (we all work shifts and such and I understand, unless you have annual leave more than a day being away isn't practical).

We offered to pay for ourselves so it wasn't too expensive but she was insistent she was going to cook and she wasn't going to do anything else. I left it not wanting to upset her but I was becoming a bit upset feeling like every single thing I had asked for had been binned.

I contacted her today and asked if we could maybe do something a bit different like going to a restaurant or takeout, I pointed out that I had already compromised pretty heavily coming to her City meaning I couldn't go to my original destination.

My sister(29F) asked me(27F) to tag along with her to go thrifting today so she came and picked me up. I went looking at the purses, and found $200 with a bank receipt inside one of many zippers (I always check them after finding $20 once lol) It states their full name, etc. it’s dated over a month back. 

I searched for the person online and on FB, and I believe I found who it belongs to almost 100%..

The thing is, I need this money SO bad. I was let go from my job a few weeks ago very unexpectedly, was barely making ends meet before this. One of my cats had another unexpected vet bill, which left me in the negative this past Friday.

I already started a new job, but this money would literally get me and my two cats by until next week when I get paid. If I don’t keep this, they would run out of food if the food banks don’t have any, myself included before I get paid again.

My sister told me I should keep it. That I would be crazy to return it to the store. Her response was the same once I informed her that I had believed I found who it belonged to before when I suggested I should turn it over to the store until she told me they would just keep it.


Before this, to say the least I was panicking, and I feel so fucking ashamed enough as it is that my first thought was “I’ve been saved”.

I’m not this type of person at heart at all.
It makes me happy to help/give back to people when I can. I am kind. I am a good person at heart. I know if this happened to me, I would be devastated if somebody didn’t return it. I keep thinking, what if that was part of their rent? What if that was their kids birthday money? What if they REALLY needed that money? What if without that money, they can’t afford something they really needed.

I also think if I keep it, I will feel like the worst piece of shit asshole there ever truly was. But then I think about my cats.. and how they could benefit from this too. It’s like I lose physically/emotionally each route I go.


I haven’t touched a dime since I found it yesterday. I guess I need somebody to tell me to do the right fucking thing and get over it, and that I need to stop being an asshole human being. I know our world has enough.

Before this, to say the least I was panicking, and I feel so fucking ashamed enough as it is that my first thought was “I’ve been saved”.

I’m not this type of person at heart at all.
It makes me happy to help/give back to people when I can. I am kind. I am a good person at heart. I know if this happened to me, I would be devastated if somebody didn’t return it. I keep thinking, what if that was part of their rent? What if that was their kids birthday money? What if they REALLY needed that money? What if without that money, they can’t afford something they really needed.

I also think if I keep it, I will feel like the worst piece of shit asshole there ever truly was. But then I think about my cats.. and how they could benefit from this too. It’s like I lose physically/emotionally each route I go.


I haven’t touched a dime since I found it yesterday. I guess I need somebody to tell me to do the right fucking thing and get over it, and that I need to stop being an asshole human being. I know our world has enough.

He was renting a room in an apartment but since we fell in love instantly he decided to move at my place after a couple of weeks of dating. I live alone and my expenses for rent and bills amount to 930 euros per month. Our salary is similar, he gets paid slightly more than me and has benefits such as 7 euros a day for lunch that he uses for groceries mostly for the both of us.

It has been 3 months and noone has replaced him, and his lease expires at September. 
Yesterday we had a thorough look at ""our"" expenses, and each should give around 470 euros per month to live together. He says that since he is paying the rent of the other place, he will detract the 280 euros from the 470. Plus, he says that since he has these vouchers of 7 euros/day (mind, they are not convertible to actual money, they are solely for groceries and expire within the day), he will detract the sum of them as well. In his opinion it is therefore fair to pay me 19 euros per month (which is 470 -280 - the groceries in coupons), against the 930 euros that fall on my shoulders. 

I feel like I m taken advantage of, so I requested he goes back to his place until September at the least.

For mothers day this year, I (37F) put together a lost of tasks that I have on my to-do list and asked my husband (43m) to take care of some of them. Money is tight, so I didn't want to ask for physical gifts. Things on my list included:
Going through both kids clothes to clear out what they have out grown, hanging shelves that I've had for several months that are sitting in the bathroom, clearing out some unused furniture, etc. I also expressed that cleaning the kitchen and downstairs would be appreciated. 

My son (10) went through his own clothes and made 2 donate bags. My husband refused to help my daughter (5) who is too young to do it alone. He also didn't do a single thing on my list aside from picking up my requested breakfast. He also went to Starbucks later in the day. 

This morning, I  told him I was disappointed that ""nothing"" from my list was done and he pointed out that my son's clothes were done. I told him that I wished he had done some of the other things. He says he will do a couple things that require money later on, but I'm a spoiled brat and an asshole for being disappointed. 

Now he's saying things like he's sorry my day was so bad and I should find someone that can actually make me happy...after me just saying that I was disappointed.

The baby daddy(M15) is young and obviously not able to provide much. However, talking to baby daddy's family they said they would help. 

Me and my mom were able to get most big ticket items and clothes for the baby that is due in a month. In our efforts we've gather more than we would even need. Talking to my mom we were thinking of giving the items to others who need it or selling them heavily discounted. The asshole moment comes in because we don't want to give it to baby daddy's family. We've already given them some clothes, crib, high chair, bottles. Is was decided that baby would stay mostly with my sister as she has more people living with her that could help. The intent is not to leave baby without when he goes to baby daddies house but to hopefully nudge baby daddy's family to make an effort. 

We asked a neighbor or two and they said that it's petty and will ruin the relationship between my sister and baby daddy. That is not the intent we just wish for some effort from their family. 

So WIBTA if I sold the extra baby items instead of giving them to baby daddy?

Edit: I see that I phrased the whole thing in a way that makes it seem that I am keeping the boyfriends family from having necessary item for baby. That's not it, baby has anything they would need at his house as we have provided them.

162,1cqwn0v,AITA for being disappointed in my 40th birthday?,"I turned 40 on Saturday. My husband turns 40 in a few weeks too. We have a 5 year old. I’m not one for big birthday celebrations (never had a party) but this year I’ve been dropping hints to my husband that turning 40 feels like a big deal. Perhaps worthy of a few different ways to mark the occasion etc. 

My husband is an appalling gift buyer - so, with two months notice, I gave him a very specific list of things he could consider buying me, complete with a link of where to buy them (all mostly Amazon). 

He was very generous and bought a number of items on the list tho for context, I earn 2.5 x my husband’s salary so it’s not really about the cost - it’s the thought).

However, my actual birthday was meh. There was no fuss, no breakfast in bed, no evening meal out. Not even a balloon.

I woke up early and my little one joined me in bed to watch cartoons. I opened my presents. We took our little one to the park and then had lunch at a restaurant. The location was picked by my husband as it was somewhere we could  tire our little one out afterwards).

Even my mum couldn’t be bothered to visit me - I had to pop down to see her (she lives 20 mins drive away). 

That was it. Pretty much like every Saturday. We even stopped at the supermarket on the way home to get pet food and spent the evening on the sofa watching TV. 

There was no spontaneity, no surprises. Not a homemade birthday card from my little one. 

My husband did arrange for a lovely birthday cake to be made but with fresh cream which aggravates my IBS (I can’t tell him that as he was so proud he arranged a cake) but after 15 years together I had higher expectations.  

On Sunday I woke up to the usual chores of washing, supermarket shopping, cleaning the house. This really pissed me off as I had imagined at least a low-key birthday weekend where we could do something different. Maybe arrange a baby-sitter and have Sunday to ourselves? He went swimming whilst I did the shopping. 

I couldn’t hide my disappointment and last night I told my husband I was sorry I hadn’t marked by 40th in a more spectacular way. I wasn’t looking for a party or fancy dinners - but something to make the occasion feel different, more than a regular birthday.

He said how hurtful my comments were given all his efforts and how difficult it had been hunting down presents, arranging a cake, and trying to manage/guess what I really wanted for my birthday. 

In contrast, for my husbands 30th I arranged a day of surprises then flew him to Paris for a long weekend. His 40th is coming up and I’m doing another day of surprises, a celebratory weekend, with a week’s family holiday later in the year too.

I (19f) have a half sister, Christina. She’s a year older than me and we have the same dad. She lives with her grandparents and I grew up with my mom and stepdad. Christina and I used to see each other when we were younger but we just got busy and when we were about 11/12 respectively we stopped getting forced to see each other because we were never really close. 

I have her on social media though and we occasionally talk. Christina talks a lot about our bio dad, mainly how much she hates him for never being involved in her life. Apparently her grandparents have been trying to contact him forever but can’t get hold of him. I always just let her vent. 

But I’ve never told her I’m in contact with our bio dad, and I have since I was 13 (he got in touch through a cousin of his). He lives in different countries and is not a consistent presence in my life at all, but we do talk maybe once a week and I’ve seen him a few times over the years. I never told Christina because I didn’t want her to feel bad because she wasn’t in contact with him and even now that we’re older it just never seemed like a good time to bring it up or like it would help to talk about it so I never did. 

I guess Christina is having trouble paying for college (she will be a junior in the fall) and is out of options for money. She apparently was trying to reach out to my dad’s side of the family to get in contact with him (presuming to ask for money) and she managed to find his second cousin online, whom I know and am relatively close with. He mentioned he hadn’t spoken to my dad in a while but spilled the beans that I would know how to get in contact with him. 

To be clear, she never asked me for his contact information or talked to me about reaching out to him for help, if she had I would have given it to her, but I didn’t know she was looking for him until it was too late. 

Christina chewed me out for never mentioning that I was speaking to him. She’s accused me of trying to keep him for myself which is just untrue…there’s nothing to keep, the guy is a hot mess who can’t go four hours without some kind of narcotic. She has been bombarding me with messages calling me a terrible person and her grandparents even called my mom to tell her that she was a bad person for never telling them that my dad and I were in contact, which I think is way over the top. 

I understand that she’s hurt but was I really the AH for not mentioning it when nothing good was going to come of it? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-13,"AITA for not telling my half sister I’m in contact with our bio dad? Alt account because I don’t really want to discuss this on main.

I will get a short “hello” or a “hi” and no further attempt at conversation. No smile, barely any eye contact.

One day I went to look in M’s room for something and I opened a drawer and all my thing were there, I was confused and just took them back to my room and was just in disbelief but I didn’t say anything about it bc I didn’t wanna be weird so a couple days later I noticed it was happening again so I went to his room and found it so I told my grandparents and they said they would talk to him it they never did. I was confused still am why they don’t, my grandpa got me a lock for my door so whenever I leave my room I lock it. And he would probably still steal my stuff if I don’t lock my door, but recently I’ve been getting tired of him bc he takes my stuff and my little brothers things too and breaks them like his ps4 controller and other toys he had. Whenever M try’s to talk to me I ignore him or make snarky remarks and he got butthurt bc I told him to shower bc I told him he smelled like moldy milk and he literally smelled so bad so that was a understatement, but he got mad and told my grandparents and they got mad at me for being mean. Then I got mad bc he literally steals my underwear and j have no clue what he does with them but no I say a couple bad thing and I’m the bad guy. But anyways I’m just asking AITA for being mean to my uncle ?",0.0,-0.015131411142647266,0,1
172,1cqungd,AITA for confronting my childhood friend for faking her life on instagram? ,"I (25 f) and my friend (26 f) have known each other since 2008. We were very close, almost like sisters until 2013. She was very dear to me, her only issue was her pathological lying. She lied about petty things about her life all the time. Even if we knew what the truth was. Her lying never affected our friendship until one day when she blamed me for something that she did and her parents were disgusted by me and forbade us to talk. Well I guess she knew that i would be mad at her, so she never tried to reach out again. I, on the other hand wasnt really shook by all of it (or i thought so) but I guess in the long run it made me incapable of maintaining female friendships. She completely disappeared from my life. Blocked me everywhere and all. Until 2022. I received a DM on instagram from her. She had made a new account and told me that she has become an investigative journalist and moved to Canada. I was extremely happy to receive her message and to see her succeeding in life. She said she wanted to call me and then she did. We talked for over an hour and during that time we mainly discussed her life and how amazing she is doing. I am not a saint, I was sort of jealous, like, wow she has come so ahead in life and I have nothing figured out yet. 
But that was it. We only called ONCE. Back in 2022. I tried texting her here and there. She never replied. 
She is very very active her new Instagram account though. She posts about her travel, gym, healthy food, exciting work and everything. A few days back I saw a photo on her story of an airplane on the airport that I thought no way she could edit a photo like that, (since I know cameras and photos), and I searched some keywords on pinterest and BOOM- i find that picture. I found several other photos that she had posted on her profile on pinterest. I understood that she hasnt stopped lying about her life. So i simply texted her saying “why are you posting stuff from pinterest and trying to imply that you live such an amazing life?” She didnt reply, she blocked me. So I lost her again. I feel like I could have handled it better or just maybe ignored it since it doesnt affect my life. I highly doubt that anything she told me about her wonderful life was true.

173,1cqulwr,AITA for calling out a teacher-judge in a local school singing contest?,"Hey Reddit,

I, Laura (17F) recently attended a local school singing contest where my friend, let's call her Sarah (16F), participated. The judges were a mix of teachers. One of the judges, whom I'll refer to as Mrs. Smith, seemed to have an issue with Sarah's performance. The other judges seemed hesitant to speak against her, since they arent the confrontational type, and just gave generic comments, like with everyone else

During Sarah's song, Mrs. Smith made comments like ""flat notes"" and said Sarah was ""eating her words."" However, from where I was sitting, and from the reactions the audience around me and my friends, Sarah's performance was pretty good. I may not be a singer or music-inclined, but my other musical friends didn't agree with the comments as well.

After the contest, I approached Mrs. Smith and expressed my disagreement with her judgment. One area where I might be the AH is where I said something like, ""It seems like a 'you' problem if you think Sarah was off-key or didnt understand her words. Everyone else seemed to understand and enjoy her performance just fine.""

Mrs. Smith didn't take kindly to my comment and told me that as a student, I shouldn't question the judges' decisions. But here's the thing: Mrs. Smith isn't my teacher, and I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion.

Now, some of my friends are saying I shouldn't have spoken up and that I might have caused unnecessary tension. Others think I did the right thing by standing up for my friend. So, Reddit, AITA here?

Fake names used for privacy.

P.S., So obviously she lost. They didnt release the scores. I can't say if she should have won, since everyone was still good, but she should have at least placed. It's just that Sarah seemed like she really wanted this. I would never really know of the judging was fair, if she really would have won, but like it just sucks.",Asshole,2024-05-13,"AITA for calling out a teacher-judge in a local school singing contest?

174,1cquisj,AITA - Birthday Gifts,"So I have this friend (Female) who turned 40 recently.

Back over Xmas she broke her phone and I have up one of my days to help her out.
By giving her my temp phone and transfering data etc.
This was all done, it took hours of my time.
I then as a joke said your next upgrade should be a toy phone. (She laughed etc) This is important for later......

So her Birthday rolls around. We had been in discussions about what to do.
She really wanted me to take her out to a cheese bar which I agreed and set a date in a few weeks.

She also really likes beer. So I suggested I would brew her any beer she wanted, give her the majority of the bottles (with some custom labels etc) However this would take time due to me having to brew it and get the weather right as I don't have temp control etc.

Anyway her birthday rolls around. I give her my gifts. Which as this time was only a small gift bag of a few beers, a nice bottle of toffee liquire and ofcourse, a fully gift wrapped toy phone.

So I wake up to lots of angry text messages, Why have you got me this, I thought we where friends.
Then she rants on about it was a special birthday for her and you should have got me something special, then started sending me photos of what everyone else got her.

176,1cqu8f7,WIBTAH if I eloped because my siblings had parents only weddings?,"I (f29) and my fiancé (m32) are getting married later this year. We have been engaged for almost two years now. We were waiting to get married until we were both in a good financial situation and we finally feel like it’s time. Originally I wanted a wedding with all our immediate families invited (parents, siblings, and grandparents) but over the past two years, two of my siblings got married and only parents were invited.

My siblings and I are very close. We hang out every week, talk all the time, and generally get along amazingly well. One of my siblings (m27) got married to a woman that most of my family doesn’t like. We all treat her well and keep our thoughts to ourselves. To be honest, none of us see their relationship lasting longer than 5 years, but we’ll never say that to them. They wanted a small wedding with just parents on both sides, but when asked why, they couldn’t give a reason. It kind of hurt that we (the siblings) weren’t allowed to be there, but we moved on. My other siblings felt the same way I did.

The other one of my siblings that got married (m25) had a pretty decent reason to wanting just parents. His spouse has a toxic family that treats her horribly, so she only wanted to invite her parents and one of her siblings originally, but if my brother invited his parents and siblings, we would outnumber her guests quite a bit and he didn’t want her to be upset about it. She is a very sweet girl and my family adores her. We know they didn’t do it to be petty, but it still sucked that we missed out on another wedding.

Here’s my dilemma. I know I’m being petty, but I’m still upset that for a family as close as ours is, the siblings weren’t invited. So I have honestly been debating eloping in Vegas with my fiancé and having a more expensive honeymoon instead of having an actual wedding ceremony as we originally planned here in our hometown. I have always thought the idea of being married by “Elvis” in Vegas was fun. I know it’s cheesy, but I love it and my fiancé thinks it would be funny so he’s down for it. We would pay for our parents to come to Vegas with us and be part of the wedding, but no one else would be invited. I know my siblings would be upset, but I would tell them the truth behind why we decided to elope instead.

Basically my whole family is going away to celebrate a big birthday for my dad. The groups are - me and my partner, my sister and BIL and their 1y/o and my parents. The thing is, my sister and partner have insisted that we stay somewhere with an extra bedroom for their baby. This is really hiking the cost up for all of us as we are splitting the cost three ways.

We are only going for three nights and their kid is a great sleeper so I'm not sure why they can't just put a travel cot up in their room tbh. All the rooms are doubles with ensuits and there is plenty of room downstairs so they can put him to bed and then come down and socialise until adult bedtime. He was literally in their room at home until two months ago anyway!

Failing that, I think they should pay the cost of the extra bedroom (works out at about £200 over three nights). They have quite a bit more disposable income than we do and my partner and I are desperately trying to save money as I will be off on unpaid leave for an operation in a few months.

The thing is; both parents were widowed before they met. Both had lost their first spouses early and had children from them. Dad had four, mom had three. They tried to make a happy blended family but their first kids never wanted them to marry again and never wanted to be a blended family. 30 years later and we still feel the repercussions. My sister and I don't have a relationship with our parents other children. We have no contact info for them, we are not social media friends (and yes we tried). I can't even remember the last time I saw them. Mom still sees her kids and dad sees his but it's never a family thing. I know most, if not all, of them have kids. Never met their kids. Never got invited to their weddings, never met their spouses.

My aunt, my dad's sister, knows about the party and was saying it should be all of us planning. I told her only one ""set"" of kids wants to celebrate my parents marriage and that's my sister and me. She somewhat acknowledged that neither mom's or dad's kids would want to take part in hosting this, since the marriage was never seen in a positive light by them.

But she wants them to be invited. I told her I had no way of doing that. That I have no details for them as adults. She was very persistent and pressed the issue on multiple occasions which led me to telling her to reach out and invite them herself since it's such a big deal to her. I told her she knows dad's kids. She speaks to them which is more than my sister and I do and she might actually get an answer from them. 

She told me to stop being so sarcastic because she was just thinking of what my parents would want. I told her I understood and didn't she think I thought of that, but I'm aware that I will be ignored and I'm aware they have kept me from having contact with them and that makes it very challenging. So the choice was hers if she wanted to do it or not.

She didn't like my attitude at all apparently.

179,1cqt09o,AITA for thinking my girlfriend posts about me too much on instagram?,"AITA if I think my girlfriend posts about me too much on instagram?

Me (M20) and my girlfriend (F19) have been together for over 6 months. Ive enjoyed our time together for the most part, but it all seemed to change in December after we had made our first instagram post with us together as a couple for Christmas. After her initial post she also posted me multiple times on her story saying how she loves me and thinks I’m cute. To preface, I am the first person she has ever been with romantically, and I think a part of this might be because I’m her first love, but she started to creep me out how often she began posting about me after that point.

Her following post was the next week at my friend Max’s New Years Eve party (not his real name). She kept coming up to me every hour or so and taking a picture of us together, sometimes sitting in my lap, and other times making me stand with her and her friend to take a picture. That night she posted an odd number of times on her Instagram/Snapchat stories (4 or 5) and made a post later that night on instagram. I honestly thought that it was kind of odd considering she had 1, just posted about me on instagram last week, and 2 she posted so many times on her Snapchat and Insta stories that same night.

After that instance she suddenly became comfortable about taking photos of me anywhere, she began to take pictures of us just casually hanging out, and it even got to the point where she started posting videos me pulling out of her parents driveway when I was leaving.

Even on weeks where we don’t hangout, she will find instagram filters like “if you love your man post him” or MCM (Man Crush Monday) and make collages on her story. Its gotten to the point where I think it’s annoying friends and family on her instagram feed, and posts about us only get a few if any likes.

On average I would say that she makes posts on her feed almost once a week, and on her stories about once or twice a week. However If its a day that we hangout with our friends or go and do something, she can post upwards of 10+ times, and has done this in the past at a friends birthday party. I politely confronted her after this, and she told me that shes just appreciative for her boyfriend, and kind of found it disrespectful that I considered that odd. Am I overreacting? Or is it a uncomfortable thing that she is posting about me to this degree?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-13,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend posts about me too much on instagram?

Ive enjoyed our time together for the most part, but it all seemed to change in December after we had made our first instagram post with us together as a couple for Christmas. After her initial post she also posted me multiple times on her story saying how she loves me and thinks I’m cute. To preface, I am the first person she has ever been with romantically, and I think a part of this might be because I’m her first love, but she started to creep me out how often she began posting about me after that point.

Her following post was the next week at my friend Max’s New Years Eve party (not his real name). She kept coming up to me every hour or so and taking a picture of us together, sometimes sitting in my lap, and other times making me stand with her and her friend to take a picture. That night she posted an odd number of times on her Instagram/Snapchat stories (4 or 5) and made a post later that night on instagram. I honestly thought that it was kind of odd considering she had 1, just posted about me on instagram last week, and 2 she posted so many times on her Snapchat and Insta stories that same night.

After that instance she suddenly became comfortable about taking photos of me anywhere, she began to take pictures of us just casually hanging out, and it even got to the point where she started posting videos me pulling out of her parents driveway when I was leaving.

Even on weeks where we don’t hangout, she will find instagram filters like “if you love your man post him” or MCM (Man Crush Monday) and make collages on her story. Its gotten to the point where I think it’s annoying friends and family on her instagram feed, and posts about us only get a few if any likes.

On average I would say that she makes posts on her feed almost once a week, and on her stories about once or twice a week. However If its a day that we hangout with our friends or go and do something, she can post upwards of 10+ times, and has done this in the past at a friends birthday party. I politely confronted her after this, and she told me that shes just appreciative for her boyfriend, and kind of found it disrespectful that I considered that odd. Am I overreacting? Or is it a uncomfortable thing that she is posting about me to this degree?",0.0,0.021086271852254868,0,1
180,1cqswjy,AITA for announcing my pregnancy?,"For context: K (30) and I(25) have both had abortions in the past, both completely by choice. A year or two ago, K has been expressing that she regretted her abortion to our mutual friends group chat and would express her sorrows now and then. I’ve been helping her through some of her grief but she’s been paranoid that she won’t be able to get pregnant again because of her age and other factors. I’ve tried my best to be sensitive and support her in any way I can. 

Now onto the issue: I found out that I am 7 weeks pregnant a few days before my 25th bday. On my bday, my friends and I (K included) went it to celebrate. However, knowing what I knew, I declined drinks all night, making up an excuse that I was antibiotics for an infection.  They understood but were suspicious. A few weeks after, we all planned another night out but I told them beforehand I wouldn’t be able to drink again. A lot of my friends understood except for K. She kept prying asking me why I didn’t want to drink all of a sudden. I had to make up a lie to get her off my back but it seemed she wasn’t satisfied with my answer. After finally confirming I was really pregnant and with another social event coming up where drinking will likely be involved, I announced my pregnancy to my friends in the gc. Everyone was happy for me except K. She didn’t reply at all in the gc. Instead she privately messaged me and asked me why I lied to her. I told her I wasn’t comfortable telling anyone about my pregnancy yet as it was so early and I wasn’t 100% sure. She then went on a rant about how unfair life was and that she should be the one pregnant. She stated that she was happy for me but couldn’t help but feel like I betrayed her by announcing the baby when I knew how she felt. I was dumbfounded. I knew she was struggling but I never knew that she would react like that to something I couldn’t control. She made me feel like shit. Like I wasn’t allowed to be pregnant or happy because she wasn’t. I didn’t reply and I kind of just distanced my self from her and the gc. My other friends got worried and reached out to the both of us and tried to figure out what was going on. K express her sadness and feelings in the group chat and some of my other friends started to agree with her that I was kinda an asshole knowing what she was going through. I don’t even know what or how to react to all of this rn. Was I really the asshole and was I really insensitive to k’s situation?

Edit 2: I don’t have the energy to reply to all the comments (thanks pregnancy fatigue) but I’ve read all. I’m grateful to be validated by so many. The past week was just so jarring. The more I think about it, the more bizarre K’s and my friend’s reactions are. I’m going to take time to myself and surround myself with people who actually love and support me.

183,1cqs8jr,AITA for being unsupportive of my sister’s online boyfriend?,"So, this requires a bit of context, but here we go. My sister is currently in a relationship with a guy named Paul. I don’t remember how exactly they met, but he’s a few years younger than her, (Still in high school) and they met online. (He lives in Canada, we live in the USA) Her and Paul have broken up and gotten back together a couple times before this point, both times Paul broke up with her, because he was wanting relationships with girls at his school, and didn’t want to commit. So, they had been broken up for a bit. I was kinda glad they were apart. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not glad that she had a breakup, but I don’t like Paul very much, because he’s under 18, and has been smoking weed and drinking alcohol near daily since he was in middle school or earlier, and he’s also a member in a gang at his school. He’s also kinda dishonest, as my sister told me he said he “goes to the gym 10 hours a day”, which is just… no, that’s not possible, you can’t go to school and go to the gym 10 hours a day… I’d like to think he was joking, but my sister said she didn’t catch the vibe that he was joking, so I think he just expects her to believe it lol… (And yes, his parents just let him smoke and drink apparently, which is crazy to me, but anyways…)

So, I don’t like Paul because I don’t think he’s a safe person to be around. I want my sister to be safe, and I feel like if they get in a serious relationship, it would be unsafe for her. Anyways, Paul recently messaged her back saying “I miss you”, and hit it off with her again, and now they’re together again for a third time. I’m a bit disappointed, because I was relieved to have Paul be out of our lives. The thing upsetting me most honestly is that my sister is completely willing to get back with him, and I feel like it’s mostly because of his looks. Like, she has told me that his body, hair color, and age were all perfect matches for her. It makes me uncomfortable that she’s willing to ignore major red flags, because I think she feels like his body and age match too well to move on.

Still, I’m not really afraid to poke fun at Paul when he comes up in conversations, but I think she’s accepted that I won’t get used to Paul for a while, and that she can have both of us in her life without many problems. I respect that, I may not care for Paul, but if she likes him I’ll have to accept him if possible.

My wife and I and our son Jax (18M) went on a week-long Caribbean cruise right after his school ended.

Jax is a great kid he seems to have a confidence issue. As in TOO MUCH confidence lol. I've never seen anything like it, He's the most self assured guy in the world. It's not unfounded, he's great looking and athletic and definitely a ""Mr Personality"" type, but still a bit goes a long way.

He's also something of an exhibitionist I think, which brings us to the problem. Usually he's so charming it seems harmless and he gets away with it but in this case not so.

We arrive on the ship and set sail and Jax gets ready to head to one of the pools for the first time. Let's just say his swimsuit was NOT appropriate. At all. Definitely a ""flaunt it"" type of suit.

I told him to put on something else. He had NOTHING, the kid has packed nothing but those -- for a week long cruise. What was he thinking?

I told him he had to go to one of the on-board stores and buy something else. He protested. I won. He went to a store and came back and got ready to go again but he had bought another speedo-style suit that was a lot better than what he had before but still not appropriate. And of course he couldn't return a swimsuit.

I told him to go back, buy a PROPER suit like trunks or boardie shorts or whatever, which he reluctantly did.

He whined about it, begged to wear his original, but I said no. As I said I have to admire his confidence as he would have no issue being at the pool like that and will chat up girls all day long (he is a shameless flirt) but there's a time and place.

He was mad at me and said I made him waste $100+ on two new suits he didn't need. He didn't exactly call me an asshole but he wasn't happy.  I didn't want to ruin his vacation but I wanted him to be decent.

So AITA and should I have just let him wear what he wanted?

Oh BTW if anyone is curious I made him give me the listing for where he bought the original, although this link might not be totally appropriate for work. A screen shot.. [https://tg-image.com/file/f18e82b3792c5c4c79c01.jpg](https://tg-image.com/file/f18e82b3792c5c4c79c01.jpg)

# EDIT to clear up a few things.

I'm not a prude. Not even close. He can (usually) wear what he wants, I don't care. He has sneaked in friends for skinny-dipping parties at home, I don't care. He and two friends once went streaking in the neighborhood, and were caught by an HOA ""cop,"" and I don't care. He has sex, I don't care. In fact I buy him condoms and have for a while, I order them because he has a wicked latex allergy. I'm not a prude.

To be honest, I really don't have a problem with the actual Speedos, even though they are not my style. He (and all the boys on their team) wore them for water polo and no one cared, and he will occasionally still wear them in the pool etc. That's fine. I think I had a knee-jerk reaction when he bought them on the ship because he knew that I was asking him to buy regular trunks but he tried to get as close as possible to what he originally had to pull one over on Dad, and I wasn't having it.

I will pay him back for the boardie shorts he bought (which he actually likes).

Also, say what you like but the original briefs were VERY inappropriate. If they had been black I MIGHT have let it slide, but not with the baby blue. They are LITERALLY marketed as ""hey look at my big dick.""  Even more so, they went well beyond that, there was zero mystery as to what's what in them, detail-wise. As one responder said, YES you could even determine one's circumcision status. Clearly. And they weren't even wet yet. If not wanting my kid to wear those in public makes me a prude, so be it.

We were together for 3 years, and early on I told him I have memory problems, and he said he did too. I didn't think much of it and he would remind me of stuff frequently so I wouldn't skip meals etc. A few months ago we met another guy who was one of the only friends I really had since I'm graduated and between jobs. While talking with our friend, who I'll call Shane, he pointed our that I would forget things and my BF would recall them back to me with incorrect details. I started to pick up on other things, like when he had to go to the ER after a fall and lied to the doctors about passing out, or would tell me I gave things to him that I definitely didn't. 

For some context, he grew up in Ohio, but left to go stay with a friend's parent because of family troubles. That's how I met him, and a few years into our relationship he informed me he was going to be kicked out with nowhere to go once he turns 18. I offered for him to come stay with my mom and me since I didn't want him to be homeless and he agrees. Recently I saw a text pop up on his phone with his foster mom telling him he's always welcome in their home if he needs somewhere to stay. I brought it up to him and he told me he NEVER said he would be homeless once he turned 18 and calls me a liar. I was fuming and couldn't decide if I was going to kick him out at that moment, especially since me and my mom arent the most well off and he wasnt paying rent or utilities, but I decided not to yet. I started to notice how he also did no chores and expected me to clean the whole house, and would leave dishes in his room and get mad when I offer to clean them up. The final straw was when he got a well paying job in the same field as me, that I had applied at multiple times, and no-showed most of his time on the schedule, losing the job in two weeks. For whatever reason it took me a few days to kick him out.

One night he comes to me and tells me his dad has passed away and we start planning to visit his family in Ohio. We leave the next week and stay long enough for him to meet with family and attend the funeral and sort out belongings, and then headed home, it felt wrong to be so hateful when he needed support, he needed someone now and I wanted him to stop mistreating me and my mom. I eventually decided to kick him out and told him to leave and gave him over a month to get out, and he was nice about it the whole time, but once he was gone some of our mutual friends started lashing out at me and he's been yelling at me.

My mom sent me a text to wish me a happy mother's day which I reciprocated.  I sent out messages to my mom friends, my SIL, my MIL and any other mom I could think of.  My husband came home from work.  Said nothing.  He watched some TV with me then mentioned he was going to go to bed.

I asked him if he had wished his mom a happy mother's day.  He said no.  He quite often doesn't realize the date etc so I asked him if he realized that today was mother's day.  He snapped and said ""Well yeah.  The hundred or so mother's day balloons we sold kind of gave it away.""

Oh.  I waited a couple.of minutes, thinking that maybe he would say it.  When he didn't I asked if he was going to wish me a happy mother's day.  He sighed and rolled his eyes and said ""Well if you really want me to, happy mother's day I guess.""

To be clear, I didn't want any gifts.  I have been out of work since mid March after losing my job of 8 years.  We can't afford any extra expense.  I have been feeling quite down and stressed about being out of work and how to get our bills paid.  All I wanted was a ""hey, happy mother's day"".  That's it.  That's all.

And I’m not upset with my mom because I know she just wants what’s best for her kids and she wants to see us get along but I’m at a point where I’ve already become estranged from them both and am not even sure if I would even want to reopen that line of communication.

195,1cqqqqg,AITA for telling my Mom she should divorce my stepdad?,"    Recently, my (50) mom has been struggling with her mental health and self esteem, and has been coming to me to talk about it. I live on my own now, but I've lived through her mental breakdowns as young as 11 years old, so I'm no stranger to this. 

      For context, my mom has been married to my step-dad for ten years, and I was ten at the time , but they'd already been friends since before I was born. They ended up getting married, and my sister, my mom, and I all moved to his state, about 2,000 miles away, for his job. Financially, my mom had struggled since divorcing my bio dad, and my step-dad made enough to support our whole family. 

    The issue is, he had serious anger issues. He never hit us or anything of the sort, but would get into screaming matches with my mom, and even resorted to calling us names at his worst. Safe to say, everyone's mental health went on a downward spiral for a while, but started getting better eventually.

        Now, this is important for me. I gave up on him when he had an angry moment that led to the three of us running to the car and leaving to take a break for a few hours. The issue was when he texted my mom to never come home again. It was dark out, and he had just told a woman and her three daughters that they could never come home again, and that where we slept wasn't his f*king problem. He apologized in the morning and said we could come back, but that was the tipping point for me. I don't hate him, but I just can't forget what he did to us. 

       Recently, my mom has been super depressed, and she tends to rely on me a lot when she's struggling. I'm fine with this, but over the past ten years, with therapy and wellness breaks and re-evaluations, she has not gotten better. My step-dad is kind of insensitive, even when he's not angry, and I just don't think he's good for her. I know how hard it is for her, it's a ten year relationship, and she's already had to divorce once, which was heartbreaking for her.
       I know that it was kind of a jerk thing to say to her while she wanted me to comfort her, but I needed to get it off my chest to her. I feel like I really hurt her feelings though, and I never meant to make her feel bad. Am I a jerk for telling her how I feel about her relationship, even though she didn't ask?

Edit: I forgot to mention this, but decided it was important to mention. I don't think my step-dad is a terrible person. He feels genuinely guilty about his issues with anger, and has worked really hard over the years to become a better person, and he has. He isn't as angry anymore, and is a lot better at not jumping to conclusions as quickly. However. The issue for me is one: the baggage. I don't want to hold the past over his head or anything, but I just am not interested in trying to make it work with him anymore. Second, even though he's much better now, I just don't feel he is compatible personality wise with my Mom. Obviously, it's her relationship, and her opinion matters most in this case, but watching her struggle with self esteem and depression is incredibly difficult. She is kind of a peace keeper, and I can tell that they both love each other a lot.

196,1cqqon9,"AITA For posting a revealing picture of myself online, without consulting my boyfriend?","This happened earlier this morning when my boyfriend stumbled upon my Instagram post. I, a (21F), and my boyfriend, (22M) are in a long-distance relationship. It would always take a long while before we could see each other in person that’s why we strongly value communication in our relationship.

He asked what was the purpose of me posting that one particular revealing picture of myself. This was only through messages but I could tell he was mad.

The picture in question was of me wearing a bikini at the beach. It wasn't that revealing since it only showed my waist and up. 
I can proudly say that there are far more much-exposing pictures online than the ones I posted.

I responded that I just wanted to seek approval from others and to get my mind off the fact that I was hospitalized for a week. It's like my way of telling people that I am more than just that illness.

He said he understood, except for why it had to be a revealing picture.

He was confused but mostly furious by the fact that I didn't ask for permission first and why I didn't just seek approval from him. He also asked me why he wasn't enough to get my mind off my illness.

I admitted I was wrong and wasn't thinking straight. I told him I would never post anything without his permission again and I would only seek approval from him and him only. 

He continued, completely ignoring my resolution, going on about how I just wanted to seek attention and how I enjoyed that attention from other people, particularly men. He also said how hurt he was to know that I was “prioritizing” the comments on my post first before him even though I stopped checking on the post the day before our conversation.

He told me he hated me and at this point, he could just forget that I was his girlfriend.

I was really pained by his words that I didn't even bother to deny his claims because I knew he was already jumping to conclusions. 

Having said that we value communication in our relationship, our conversation started earlier this morning, it's nighttime now, and I still haven't replied.

His last message was “Give me a good reason why it had to be a revealing picture.” and not just like those pictures I post regularly.

I honestly don't know how to respond up until now. What should I say? Am I really the Asshole?

197,1cqqm8t,AITA For telling my parents I’m not going to bother contacting them anymore,"I should start with both my parents aren’t terrible people. They did the best they could with the limited resources they had. 

I am half Indian, half Australian. My dad is a pretty nice guy but he had a lot of anger issues when I was growing up, now he’s just resigned. 
My mother is the warmest, loveliest person you could ever meet, until you don’t meet her standards. 

My Mum keeps sending me arranged marriage prospects on the basis that raising good Hindu kids with my dad was a disaster and she doesn’t want me to make the same mistakes. Here’s the thing. I’m already engaged to a musician I love and adore. He’s an incredible partner and is so supportive of my culture and learning about it. He just so happens to be white. 

Today I made it really clear I loved my partner and he really wanted to meet my Mum but I wasn’t going to push her. She replied “NO” all caps. I said that was fine, but she didn’t need to reply like that.

I tried to talk to my dad about it, but he cracked the shits with me and said he didn’t have time to be involved in my “drama”. 

And I lost it. I told my dad via text I was just so disappointed he wouldn’t do anything to help me, even though he likes my fiance, and that I wasn’t upset with him just frustrated at the situation with my mum. And he responded with “what the f do you expect me to do, seriously?!” So I said I didn’t expect him to do anything and I had given up on that a long time ago, I just wanted him to listen. 

For context everytime I call my dad to update him how I’m doing he just acts like he doesn’t care. One word responses and a lot of “mmhm”. I told my dad today that I was just going to stop calling and interrupting his life and he can contact me if he wants to actually know how I am doing.

In relation to my mum, I let her have it. She had previously expressed how disappointed she was in my lack of indianness, and how I wasn’t enough of a good Indian girl. So I told her if these guys she was sending me are looking for a nice Indian girl, by her own admisssion I am not one and she shouldn’t put me forward for them.

I told her that I am not the source of her pain and it is unfair that you seem to consider that I am and that I was choosing not to reach out anymore becuase I feel like I am hurting her more. 

I told her that the choices are up to her that she had my number and she knows where I live and that I love her I really am so grateful for everything she has done and continues to do for me, but I can’t continue to let myself be hurt by her.

199,1cqqjz6,AITA for wanting my housemate/tenant to clean their room?,"I have owned my place and have been living alone in it for 3 years, but recently with the cost of living I've had to get a housemate in the spare room to make ends meet.
They are 11 years younger than me, they're 23, which I didn't think would be an issue, but they are unbelievably messy. I'm talking Hoarders level messy.

I'm really house proud and keep everything clean and neat, and their room looks like a literal pit. I'm talking Mcdonalds wrappers that are a week old, pizza boxes on the floor, food scraps, dishes, and laundry covering the floor. I would have thought that them knowing that I'm the owner would have meant a tiny bit more respect for the space. But that doesn't seem to be the case at all. I understand that their room is their room, but if it keeps going this way, we're going to have mice and roaches.

They keep the communal areas relatively clean - good, but not great. I find that I'm doing 90% of the cleaning in the bathroom and kitchen, but I don't mind that as much.

Because I've been here for 3 years, everything is mine. Items that I've cultivated and love. Even the bed, rug and wardrobe in their room is mine. I can already see stains on the rug, and they've only been here 2 months.

I'll come home and they'll be eating soup on the couch, soup bowl resting on the couch. If that spills, that's money I'll have to spend to get the couch cleaned. They've already spilled soup once on my rug and just patted it dry with paper towel with no urgency, didnt even clean it properly. It's a $3000 rug (got on sale... but still)

They'll also do laundry and then leave their washing in the machine for days. The first time they did it, I hung it up for them because I figured they just forgot, then the second time they left it in there for over 24 hours and I sent a ""don't forget your washing!"" text, the third time they did it again and I thought to myself, I'm not their mum, I shouldn't have to remind you every time you do laundry to actually hang it up when it's done. Without me reminding them, they left it in the machine for nearly 3 days. And the kicker is they then hung it up around the house without washing it again and the whole house stunk of damp.

The one massive pro - they have a partner and they spend a few nights a week at their place.

I cannot afford to not have a tenant in the spare room. 

They are on a 3 month lease, with month to month after that. My question is, do I ask them to leave once their lease is technically up in a month, and try my luck again with another tenant? Or is it okay to mention maybe to keep food out of their room?

I understand it's a weird dynamic living with your technical landlord... tricky to navigate.

200,1cqqhwf,AITA for keeping ontop of my boyfriend about his jobs applications?,"I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (31M), let’s call him Ryan, for almost 2 years now. It is my most serious relationship so far and so far it’s been great. He’s become my best friend and I’ve come to care for him so deeply. 

For context, Ryan moved to my country a little over 3 years ago for what seemed like a great job opportunity. But he quickly realised the living costs here did not match what he was getting paid. We met during this time and I pushed him to find a new job that was worth his time. 

He eventually did but this new job is 2 hours away in a very rural area, so he moved there and he comes to my city once during the week and stays with me on the weekends since there is not much to do where he stays. It’s been almost a year now at this new job and the quality of life has significantly become worse and his workplace has become incredibly toxic. He often works 11+ hours every day, including every other Saturday and honestly his boss sounds like hitler. He even got fired for taking sick leave once, and then his boss came to his senses and rehired him 2 days later 🤦‍♀️. He complains about his work all the time and I can see it’s really starting to affect him mentally. 

My sister in law works in his industry gave Ryan the HR manager details at her company. Ryan has been in touch with them but he feels like he is nagging the HR manager too much. I keep telling him to not give up and that if he doesn’t follow up aggressively he’ll let this opportunity slip through his fingers. They are advertising several jobs right now that he could be a candidate for. 

It got to the point where last night I brought it up again and he blew up at me. Ryan didn’t get the chance to get a bachelors degree but has a technical diploma in his field and has a lot of experience. He kept saying it isn’t as easy for him to get the jobs he wants because he can’t ‘flash a fancy degree’ like mine. He says I’ll never understand what he’s going through and it’s completely unfair for me to keep bringing this up. 

Fair, I get why he thinks I don’t understand - maybe I don’t. But, I don’t want him to just give up. He has a foot in the door and my sister in law is willing to help, but I can see this is becoming a big pain point for him when I bring this up. So I’m unsure if I should just let it go and let him figure it all out on his own, or if I should keep trying to motivate him. I just want the best for him and especially for him to get out of his current situation at work. 

FYI he has applied for many many other jobs, but nothing has come of those so far. He is also started some short courses for additional study to help him get into a more managerial position. Is there a better way to handle this perhaps? Or am I just being an asshole / nagging girlfriend and should I just not bring this up again?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-13,"AITA for keeping ontop of my boyfriend about his jobs applications?

For context, Ryan moved to my country a little over 3 years ago for what seemed like a great job opportunity. But he quickly realised the living costs here did not match what he was getting paid. We met during this time and I pushed him to find a new job that was worth his time. 

He eventually did but this new job is 2 hours away in a very rural area, so he moved there and he comes to my city once during the week and stays with me on the weekends since there is not much to do where he stays. It’s been almost a year now at this new job and the quality of life has significantly become worse and his workplace has become incredibly toxic. He often works 11+ hours every day, including every other Saturday and honestly his boss sounds like hitler. He even got fired for taking sick leave once, and then his boss came to his senses and rehired him 2 days later 🤦‍♀️. He complains about his work all the time and I can see it’s really starting to affect him mentally. 

My sister in law works in his industry gave Ryan the HR manager details at her company. Ryan has been in touch with them but he feels like he is nagging the HR manager too much. I keep telling him to not give up and that if he doesn’t follow up aggressively he’ll let this opportunity slip through his fingers. They are advertising several jobs right now that he could be a candidate for. 

It got to the point where last night I brought it up again and he blew up at me. Ryan didn’t get the chance to get a bachelors degree but has a technical diploma in his field and has a lot of experience. He kept saying it isn’t as easy for him to get the jobs he wants because he can’t ‘flash a fancy degree’ like mine. He says I’ll never understand what he’s going through and it’s completely unfair for me to keep bringing this up. 

Fair, I get why he thinks I don’t understand - maybe I don’t. But, I don’t want him to just give up. He has a foot in the door and my sister in law is willing to help, but I can see this is becoming a big pain point for him when I bring this up. So I’m unsure if I should just let it go and let him figure it all out on his own, or if I should keep trying to motivate him. I just want the best for him and especially for him to get out of his current situation at work. 

FYI he has applied for many many other jobs, but nothing has come of those so far. He is also started some short courses for additional study to help him get into a more managerial position. Is there a better way to handle this perhaps? Or am I just being an asshole / nagging girlfriend and should I just not bring this up again?",0.0,1.0466262102127075,1,0
201,1cqqed8,AITA for not promoting my dad's store on my blog?,"I (17F) have a Wordpress blog I started a year ago to write movie reviews and talk about indie movies.

My dad (55M) has a small t-shirt business that the whole family (him, mom, me, and my brother) all help out and participate in. My parents created it a year ago as a side hustle in the hopes of becoming their main hustle, but (I know all the ins and outs of the business), we have barely made anything. 

All that to say, my dad has a blog where he promotes the t-shirts from time to time, also to no avail. He sees how many views my blog gets, and asked me to make a post on my blog about one series of shirts and recommend people to check them out.

The shirts have nothing to do with movies (they're actually kid shirts), but my dad said people can buy them for their children/nieces/nephews. He is excited by my views/engagement and wants me to make a post, and maybe I am a total asshole for this, but I just don't want to?

On the first of this month someone I was FWB (24F) and I (25M) had a falling out and she blocked my number and all social media. Before we had a falling out she told me she would be gone that next week to New York to visit her brother, knowing that she wouldn't be there I decided to call the shop and talk to the guy who runs it I'll call him D to keep from name dropping. I spoke to D directly and didn't give him any specific details other than we had a falling out and havent spoken since and asked him if he would pick up any future appointments since I like his work and has the best prices. D responded by saying ""I didn't know anything about it, but if you wanna get more work done you can come by anytime"". So I booked an appointment for that next day went in hung out with D while waiting for my turn in line. Today my ex texted me asking me not to come back and I informed her that I talked to D directly and if she had any problems take it up with him. Some back and forth happened I even offered to not block her number so I could give her advance notice of date and time for future appointments. She accused me of stalking since it's around a 1:30 hour drive from where I live. (Keep in mind I live in a rural area and almost all tattoo shops are roughly the same distance away). I ended the conversation by telling her ""if you have a problem with it take it up with D and have him contact me directly and tell me what he wants to do"". So AMITAH.

I (M37 at the time) went out with my brother and a group of our friends to a local Indian restaurant for diner. 

We were all seated, made up our minds about what we would order, placed our order and were served with glasses of water as we waited for the rest of our drinks/food. 

As we were drinking our waters, roughly 5 of us, one of the waiters was coming over and filling the water glasses. You would take 1 or 2 gulps, he came by filled the glass. 4 sips, filled the glass, 3 sips, filled the glass, 1 or 2 sips, filled the glass. All the while with this big smile on his face. 

I started getting a bit annoyed here because he would just wind up interrupting us while we spoke across the table to each other with his flailing water warm. 

At one point, as I was taking a sip of water, I pulled the glass away from my mouth, glass still in hand, and he filled the glass while I was still holding it! This made me snap, I yelled out ""Dude!"" Then looked him straight in the face and with lower voice said, ""if we want more water we will call you over, please don't come back until we ask for more water"". 

Waiter walks away, big grin still on his face.

204,1cqq556,AITA for lifting up my dog by the harness,"So I was at the beach with my dog and this really cute baby Dalmatian comes up to us and my dog (he’s a 12 pound Pom) and starts sniffing each other. Then they get just a little aggressive and start growling and nipping at each other a bit, so I quickly shorten the leash and pick my dog up by the leash with the harness supporting and holding his body. Then once he’s close enough to my arms I grab his belly to hold him.

 The mom and the kids (owner of the Dalmatian) looked at me like I was crazy. Looking at me like why the hell would she lift her dog like that. And the mom was like “OH” in surprise and shock. I say “sorry I just don’t want anything to happen.” The mom was like “oh well she would not bite” and I was just kinda looked at them and was like “yea” and walked away. When they started to walk away the daughter who was like 12 just stayed behind for like 10 seconds to glare at me and give me a death stare.

 We walked along the beach and turned back around only to see them again, the daughter AGAIN obviously walked past me glaring at me giving me this disgusted face like i was some horrible person. I threw my hands up and gave her a dirty look back (not my best moment to give a 10 year old a death stare but I was just so angry at that point) 

But in the end I wasn’t just trying protect my dog but I was protecting her dog too. I didn’t know if my dog would bite, the dog was a puppy so they actually don’t know if she would bite either idk why they were so sure she wouldn’t bite. I know maybe wasn’t the best way to lift my dog by the harness but that’s the safest response I thought possible to avoid any problems. So am I a monster for lifting my dog this way or do these people just not know what their thinking?

I have struggled with abandonment and depression issues due to my bio-dad leaving me. Me and my Mom have not had a good relationship since I was 16. All throughout my childhood, I had struggled with depression. To the point that my school counselors would tell my parents to get me help. They didn't listen until after I attempted to commit myself when I was 16. That had brought on more issues for me and my mom.

Background...his father did not want to sign and did not sign the birth certificate. He did not want him to have his last name and doesn't. He didn't come to the hospital when he was born because he thought he would automatically be put on child support.

I will FaceTime a few times out of the week, but he doesn't always answer. If he calls back, it's too late or the next day. And if we meet up there's always strings attached. Like can you take me to the corner store or can you drop me off of my friends house. Last time we met up and had a fallen out, so I set my boundaries and told him, I couldn't take him anywhere. See and spend time with your son and that's it. 

Over the year and nine months he has only brought his son, a $70 pair of Jordan's, one big box of pampers and wipes. 

He complains that him not seeing his son is my fault. His son crying when he sees him is also my fault. He doesn't have a car, but he get around everywhere else, why can't he come visit his son? 

If I don't call or take the incentive, it won't happen. And I'm ok with that. My son is not without proper male father figures or role models in his life.

(In the same row as me) After the few minutes the mother of the bunch clearly LEAVES the kids in the rated R film (it’s Abigail) btw. I’m guessing the Kids range 12-16. Theres 3 kids and they’re being loud and using their screens showing each other texts and talking loud about stuff not even movie related. At this point, 20 minutes has past of disruption. So I ask the eldest and closest to me if he can turn his screen down. He says yes, and apologizes. After that it goes down hill from there. The other kids start talking louder and talking SHIT at that. So from there I’m like this is ridiculous I’m making a complaint. Fast forward past management asking for their Gaurdian she finally arrives after another 30 minutes and tries to confront my MOTHER (who is in her 50’s) in the dark. I of course step in front and make myself clear I won’t argue in a theater we can step outside if it’s that big an issue. She refuses and calls me all type of bitches and hoes. Just such an unpleasant experience. I’m still left with a tiny thought wondering if I was an asshole in anyway.",0.0,0.030124807730317116,0,1
