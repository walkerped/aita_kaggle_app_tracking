0,1crvzfi,AITAH for uninviting my son's stepmom to his grad party?,"Backstory: My (37F) son (17M) has a very strained relationship with his father and stepmom. He is trans (FtM) and they are Catholic, so they refuse to accept his transition and call him by his dead name and pronouns. He lives with me full time after having a huge fight with them shortly after coming out. (He used to live with them 50/50). His father is quite passive, and stepmom is a narcissist. He goes along with everything she says. 

My son is graduating in a month. He just handed out invites to his grad party. Shortly after giving one to his dad and stepmom, Stepmom text my son about his grades and if he is even graduating. (My son doesn't have the best GPA but he is on track to graduate). She was extremely condescending on the texts and asked if he needed to come stay with her and dad because obviously I wasn't tracking his grades well enough. 

He sent me the texts, and I kindly text her back, saying I appreciate the concern, but he is on track to graduate and I have it handled. And that in the future, I wish she would text more about his day then to just get on him about grades. And that it hurts him that she seemingly only reaches out when something is wrong. She then responded with a snarky that she can see the grades and she called the school, and that DEAD NAME'S counselor is also concerned about his grades. And that she texts DEAD NAME all the time. (She does not. My son tells me every time her or dad text or call). 

After that, I blew up on her. I told her his name is PREFERRED NAME and his pronouns are He/Him and it's time she respected that. She countered with "" You are a fucking idiot. You can't change your sex, you fucking moron. You have her so brainwashed, it's pathetic.""

After that, I told her not to bother coming to the grad party and that she was uninvited. She said ""Try and stop me."" 

My son was pretty upset about the whole thing afterwards, and had a bit of a mental health spiral. I think he is afraid that his dad won't come now. 

So, Am I the asshole? Obviously, I was just trying to protect my son. I have been civil and compliant of this narcissistic bitch for years and I can't keep letting her talk to my son the way she does anymore. I'm starting to think maybe I should have just ignored her to stay civil until after graduation. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-05-14,"AITAH for uninviting my son's stepmom to his grad party?

Few things I should have mentioned in my last post but i didn't- Not all people were against me many supported me my fault for not mentioning it also this happens a lot in Asian families and honestly I was surprised it's so rare everywhere else lol.
Well I found how my MIL came to know about my stretchmarks. My husband casually mentioned in a chat he had with her and it turns out she barely has any stretch marks on her (superior genetics I guess...) and surprise, surprise for some reason she hates me and she tried to turn my husband against me by telling him that's it not normal and I must be doing something wrong and that it can be harmful for the baby (the audacity). I guess it
worked my husband also started doubting and pestering me about it.
I had a long chat with my husband about it and he's agreed to try to work things out starting with marriage counseling as many of you suggested and I also twisted his arm to go to individual therapy. We are still living separately and to make things clear he has never abused me before this incident though thanks to you all I realized
how condescending his family was towards me subtly.
He has agreed to go NC with them and we won't be
allowing them to visit the baby. I have told him that if things don't work out divorce is still very much an option for me so I hope it doesn't get to it.
Anyways thank you all for your advice, it helped me so much and i hope it all works out for me :) ",UPDATE,2024-05-14,"Update- ""AITA for shouting at my husband at a family gathering"" Link to the original post- https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/LWlDkdBbLW

4,1criihz,AITA for yelling at my foster mother during a doctor visit?,"To give a bit of a backstory, I have been experiencing pain in my body for about 2 years of my life, I then entered care last year in January. Since I entered care the pain has gotten increasingly worse. It happens everywhere in my body on my fingers, wrists, ankles, thighs, feet, head, ears, arms, back, and especially my chest as the pain can be so terrible I can not function properly. Certain tasks such as work, cleaning, and moving have become so stressful and painful that I have to sleep/rest for hours just to regain some strength. To top it off, every 3-5 days I get fever-like symptoms, but when test results such as my temperature are checked everything is normal. 

The Doctors who would at first give me simple medication assuming it was just sprains or anxiety. I disagreed with their opinions and refused to take the medication. We tried countless doctors until we went to a new one an hour away and they took some blood tests, only thing that came up different was I had a positive ANA test result. The pain worsened And as it did I would complain only to be told by my mother to stop my complaining, that she doesn't care and I shouldn't tell her because she can't do anything.

The Same doctor who took the blood test gave me medication. I took 6 medications I would take for about 4 weeks. The pain unfortunately continued to occur with an increase of headaches than normal and I was exhausted. 

Today we went to the same doctor to follow up on the medicine. I told the doctor how I felt during the medication, and after that my foster parent and doctor went outside the room, I heard them talk about how it was all in my head and that I had psychological problems. When they came into the room I told them I wasn't lying about the pain. They reassured me they didn't think I was lying but then my foster mom went into what they said “We don't think you're lying, we think it's in your head. You pick and choose medication and you only feel better when you get things.” When I tell you I blew up, I blew up. I yelled at my foster mother “How dare you say something like that! You just implied that I'm lying about it!” I continued to yell at her “You don't know anything about me!”

To me personally when she said I only feel better when I get things it makes it seem like I fake the pain so I can get out of things or get things. She then compared me to the gypsy Rose situation and said it was similar. I was now enraged, I told her if I ever found out what I had and it was something that wasn't in my head, she was going to apologize. They left the room, and I just started crying.

This foster mother had the tendency to tell others it was all in my head like my case worker and CASA (court representative) .

5,1cridri,AITA for simply texting Happy Mother's Day to my mother whom I just met for the first time in a few weeks ago after not seeing her for 33 years? ,"You read that right. When I was 6, my mom lost custody of my brother and I, and after that happened I didn't see her ever again up until a few weeks ago. She got married traveled the world and lived her life. I spoke to her on the phone on and off over the past few years but we always lost touch with one another. She finally agreed (after flaking out many times on previous plans) for us to meet and it was a neutral experience in my eyes. I honestly felt pretty resentful to see how amazing her life ended up turning out and how happy she seemed while my brother and I were mentally, sexually, physically, and emotionally abused in our childhood by our father and stepmother. Also, when I was 15 my father left our family and my stepmother no longer wanted to care for us so I ended up in the system and ultimately on my own from that point forward. Life was a freaking struggle and I didn't have anyone to call to help me in times where I could have used the help. I felt resentful towards her for being so carefree and naive about life when I was in her presence. She casually threw around how she owned several homes and traveled the world and how financially free and set up she and her husband were. ***I just hated hearing it***. The kicker to me was that she had the nerve to judge my brother and me for how we turned out and what we chose to do with our lives. Neither one of us are college educated but both of us are entrepreneurs. My brother is a millionaire and I'm still not in a space (yet) where my business has taken off and I'm bartending and waiting tables on the side (she's been criticizing me for this and telling me I need to get a real job). 

This woman just doesn't get it. She even had the nerve to talk about my parenting (I had a child in high school and dropped out BUT I RAISED HER and she turned out to be a pretty damn good gal-She's currently in the Navy and I couldn't be more proud-plus she is such a daddy's girl and I am so proud that I was able to break a generational family curse two-fold). 

Anyway, I was dreading Mother's day this year TBH, I knew she was going to expect a grand gesture from me and I just sent a text that said ""Happy Mother's Day."" She ignored the text and responded back today telling me I was pathetic for such a dry and unthoughtful Mother's Day gesture and that she deserved more than that from me. 

She even got my brother involved and my brother told me I should have done more.

  
I'm so confused. Isn't Mother's Day for mothers who raised their children or am I nuts?

We met in person during work and have been friends since then. He got a more close friend (D) and they grew up together but they also have a on and off friendship. I tried to be neutral but at the end i was more supportive to him (A) because i think sometimes you just need to vent and his childhood friend (D) did fuck up pretty often. You can share games on PS5 i played some of his games and he some of mine. After a big fight between them they began to spend time together again and i felt a little left alone but that's just me making something bigger than it is. Today i entered the voice chat and with a annoyed and frustrated tine he demanded that i deactivate his account on my console to stop the sharing. I was really upset that this came out of nowhere with really dumb reasons so i said that this is childish and deactivated it after leaving the voicechat. His reasons:
- I open his profile to see what he plays
- I make comments that he buys some games physical instead of digital ( yes it was a bummer sometimes but i didn't make it a big deal)
- I asked about games he privated to hide them because of his personal reasons (that happened once and i was just curious about his progress but as i notices he didn't want to talk about it i stopped the same moment)

I believe he just wanted to share with his childhood friend (D) again and used those points that he had problems with as an excuse

My biggest problem is he never talked about those things with me and suddenly came with all that stuff all at once and thats really disrespectful towards our friendship and thats why u was really upset.

7,1cri6ds,AITA for telling my girlfriend that she needs to stand up to the partner she's living with?,"Hello everyone. My only request is that you try to be nice.

I (28 F) am in a poly relationship with my BF (20 M) and my GF (23 F). Bf and gf are in a side relationship with another gf, we'll call her OGF. BF and GF have been in a relationship for 2 years and I only joined recently (About 3 months ago). GF ended up moving in with OGF a couple of months ago.

From the stories I have been told from GF and my brother and from my own personal experiences with OGF, I have come to realize that OGF is controlling to a toxic degree and I feel very strongly about it. According to GF herself, OGF gives very stern warnings for everything, especially about how GF treats OGF's dog, who, in accordance to brother, is treated better than GF. He learned this from things GF has told him directly.

I have decided to support GF with the help of BF and brother. We recently told GF that if she wanted things to change, she needed to stand up to OGF and stand her ground. For context, GF is essentially a doormat. In verbal altercations, she tends to back down whenever her opponent shows any degree more fight than her. I am concerned that OGF is walking all over GF and GF is just letting it happen, knowingly, because she doesn't feel like she can do anything about it.

I am trying to help her be able to stand up on her own and we got in a fight recently where I told her to grow a spine after listening to her talk about how she hadn't eaten but didn't want to eat because she was afraid of making too much noise and waking up OGF. GF then yelled at me, saying it was similar to something brother said after an argument they had, saying it was condescending.

AITA for telling GF she needs to grow a spine and take care of herself?

Edit:

GF, BF, and I live in three separate states though we have talked about getting a place together. Since I'm still fairly new to the dynamic, those talks have been few and far between.

Update: Last night before bed, I came to my own conclusion that IWTA and I talked to her about it. She said that both of us could have handled it differently and we had a nice chat. I read all the comments this morning and want to clarify a couple of things. I noted in one comment last night that I had left out what I had seen as ""minor details"". They are minor to me but I guess for clarification sake they are major.

1: GF and I have tried for a relationship twice before and neither of us were in the right headspace for it at the time. I have known GF for going on 2 years.

2: I would like to note that this is not the way I talk to just anyone. I took this approach with GF last night because this sort of thing usually works. She explained to me last night that that particular phrase held a bit of trauma for her and was why she reacted the way she did.

Think of me how you want. I am who I am and I know where I stand. This was more so a thing I did in the heat of the moment to vent some stress and will probably be taken down this weekend anyway.",Asshole,2024-05-14,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she needs to stand up to the partner she's living with?

I (28 F) am in a poly relationship with my BF (20 M) and my GF (23 F). Bf and gf are in a side relationship with another gf, we'll call her OGF. BF and GF have been in a relationship for 2 years and I only joined recently (About 3 months ago). GF ended up moving in with OGF a couple of months ago.

From the stories I have been told from GF and my brother and from my own personal experiences with OGF, I have come to realize that OGF is controlling to a toxic degree and I feel very strongly about it. According to GF herself, OGF gives very stern warnings for everything, especially about how GF treats OGF's dog, who, in accordance to brother, is treated better than GF. He learned this from things GF has told him directly.

I have decided to support GF with the help of BF and brother. We recently told GF that if she wanted things to change, she needed to stand up to OGF and stand her ground. For context, GF is essentially a doormat. In verbal altercations, she tends to back down whenever her opponent shows any degree more fight than her. I am concerned that OGF is walking all over GF and GF is just letting it happen, knowingly, because she doesn't feel like she can do anything about it.

I am trying to help her be able to stand up on her own and we got in a fight recently where I told her to grow a spine after listening to her talk about how she hadn't eaten but didn't want to eat because she was afraid of making too much noise and waking up OGF. GF then yelled at me, saying it was similar to something brother said after an argument they had, saying it was condescending.

AITA for telling GF she needs to grow a spine and take care of herself?

Edit:

GF, BF, and I live in three separate states though we have talked about getting a place together. Since I'm still fairly new to the dynamic, those talks have been few and far between.

Update: Last night before bed, I came to my own conclusion that IWTA and I talked to her about it. She said that both of us could have handled it differently and we had a nice chat. I read all the comments this morning and want to clarify a couple of things. I noted in one comment last night that I had left out what I had seen as ""minor details"". They are minor to me but I guess for clarification sake they are major.

1: GF and I have tried for a relationship twice before and neither of us were in the right headspace for it at the time. I have known GF for going on 2 years.

2: I would like to note that this is not the way I talk to just anyone. I took this approach with GF last night because this sort of thing usually works. She explained to me last night that that particular phrase held a bit of trauma for her and was why she reacted the way she did.

Think of me how you want. I am who I am and I know where I stand. This was more so a thing I did in the heat of the moment to vent some stress and will probably be taken down this weekend anyway.",1.0,1.0635786,1,1

**For context** the relationship between my ex and I is contentious so i try not to talk to her unless it’s about the kids. We just had a 3 year court battle with kid withholding, a lot of her accusing me of being a bad dad and dangerous and me ultimately gaining primary custody.  Our 15 year old son lives with us and sees his mom every other weekend.  I pay for everything and it’s been hard getting her to even pay for some medical fees, though to be fair she buys him nice clothes and 200 dollar jordans occasionally.

I had a trip planned for ages over memorial day which is my ex’s weekend - when all of a sudden our son tells me last month his friend asked him to be in a quinceneara end of may. No details, nothing on time, just the date. I told him its his moms weekend and he needs to talk to her about it which he keeps claiming he did, as she even took him to a practice on her weekend. I also mentioned it to her.

I finally got the friend’s parent’s number out of my son this week and texted asking for details. Turns out it won’t end until 10-1030 pm and then they are driving the kids back to our city which is 45 min away making it super late for my ex to pick him up.  I told her i can arrange for him to sleepover at his friends house that he sleeps over at often who will also he at the quince and she can get him the next morning if that’s easier.

So now she is mad at me saying I’m a bad co-parent and why am I going out of town, she would have preferred to switch weekends if she knew it was so late and she had to drive an hour, that he is 15 years old and too young to be out until 12 am (and shouldn’t be sleeping over at friend’s houses).  I think we landed on her picking him up from the quince early because she doesn’t want him staying out but I feel like this is still somehow my fault because of how mad she was, like I should have cancelled my vacation or something and just taken the hit financially or shouldn’t have gone in the first place or should I have just told my son he couldn’t go to the quince?

9,1cri1ms,AITA for having had feelings for my now-girlfriend while she was already in a relationship?,"I (26, M) met my now-girlfriend (26, F) of five months when I went to university for my post-graduation. We immediately clicked and became good friends. Soon after, I developed romantic feelings for her.

I confessed my feelings to her earlier last year, to which she said that she was not in a position to offer me anything more than friendship as she was committed to someone else.

I thought I could control my feelings and distance myself from her, but I couldn’t help myself. I enjoyed talking to her and spending time with her, and she enjoyed my company as well. We would spend a big part of our day together in college, then hang out after college was over. We also went out frequently, and over time, we grew closer. Everyone in our college could sense that I had feelings for her, and she was aware of it too. She repeatedly told me not to expect anything more than friendship from her, but at this point, we had become more than just friends. Later on, she even admitted that she had some feelings for me as well, but she couldn't offer anything beyond friendship because she already had someone else in her life whom she loved a lot. Given the circumstances, it was very confusing for me to define our relationship because clearly, we were more than friends, but we were not a couple. At this point, I realized that what we had going was a situationship. Ironically, many people in our college thought we were a couple.

Our closeness didn’t sit well with her boyfriend, leading to frequent arguments between them over me. Eventually, their relationship deteriorated to the point where he became abusive. This led her to stop seeing and talking to him, for which he held me responsible. He feared that she might get involved with me, and to deter me from pursuing her, he even sent me some of her private pictures, intending to imply that both of them had been physically intimate.

Eventually, she broke up with him, and naturally, it was a very traumatic time in her life. I tried to support her during this period, and eventually, we grew even closer. Some time later, we entered into a relationship.

Now, here’s the thing, last night I made a remark about her now-ex, to which she responded that I shouldn't say anything bad about him. I asked her how she could still respect him after whatever had happened, to which she told me that he had loved her a lot and that she felt guilty for causing him pain by being close to me. She then started blaming me, saying that because of me, she couldn’t spend quality time with him. She claimed that the time that he deserved, she gave to me. She even said that at times, she avoided going to his place for fear that I might question her whereabouts. She didn’t want me to know she was meeting him.

12,1crhofz,AITA for telling my friend we had a sleepover without them?,"I (18F) and my friend, Becca (18NB) were on the phone a few nights ago. I was talking about our school dance that we recently had.

For context, Becca hasn't been in my main friend group because they aren't in our group chat (It's a stupid rule, but its whatever). Everyone in our groupchat is friends with Becca, except for one person, Izzy, who, for whatever reason, doesn't like them. Izzy was hosting the afterparty for the dance. Becca and my mutual friend Francie have a group chat together. After Francie and I had begged Izzy to let Becca come to the afterparty because they were taking photos with us before the dance anyways, Izzy finally gave in, but said that Becca wasn't allowed to sleepover.

I don't really understand Izzy's deal with Becca, she seems to be the only person who doesn't like Becca all that much in our friend group, even though Becca is a genuinely kind person who loves talking to people and loves making friends. Becca and I frequently talk on the phone at night and debrief, and a few nights ago was one of those nights. I was talking to Becca about Izzy's deal with them and spilling the tea, so to speak, and it just kind of slipped out that there was a sleepover they weren't invited to. They started getting upset and was saying things like ""Oh my gosh I totally embarassed myself in front of everyone"" and ""You and Francie lied to me, everyone lied to me."" I was really trying my hardest to comfort them, but then I started hearing their voice quiver. I asked if they were okay, and they sadly said ""I think I'm going to go"" in tears, and then hung up immediately after. I texted them multiple times afterwards, but I still haven't gotten a response.

I genuinely feel so awful about this, I regret not telling them before, and I regret not pushing harder with Izzy to let Becca sleepover. I regret most of all seemingly putting a strain on our relationship, I truly love Becca and I really hope they aren't too upset with me.

I want to make it clear here that the sleepover was at Izzy's house, so I couldn't just invite Becca to stay because it wasn't my house and ultimately wasn't up to me.

I again, want to say how much I love Becca, and I know that if I added them to our group chat Izzy would freak out and remove them or get really upset with me.

Anyways, I've tried to lose weight without any success (usually the opposite affect) quite a few times, but I've found that the only thing that's helped hold me somewhat accountable is weight checks. 

My family isn't very supportive of my weight loss attempts, they don't let me cook my own meals, nor do they eat healthy as a whole family, and I am often forced to get seconds or even thirds when I say I don't want more. Calorie counting, while a great tool for some, made me feel powerless since I am not allowed to dictate my own diet, and it was mainly counterproductive for me. Every morning since January, I've made a daily trek down to my parents room in order to step on their scale and weigh myself. By about late February, my parents caught on to what I was doing and no longer allow me in there in the morning (I used to bring them coffee, sit in bed with my mom and talk, and occasionally have her help do my crazy thick wavy hair). This really caused me to regress in my weight loss attempts and I gained a whopping 10 pounds in the past few months.

However, when I told my parents this, they freaked out. They said that I have an unhealthy relationship with food and that it's irresponsible of me to want a scale. It would send my younger sisters a bad message (they don't even share a bathroom with me) against body positivity and that they did not raise me to be a girl who is obsessed with her weight.

15,1crh9vn,"AITA for wanting to acknowledge my own Mother on Mothers Day alongside my wife, given the fact this is my wife’s first Mother Day after the birth of our first child a few weeks ago?","I am genuinely curious on what I experienced this past Mother’s Day and whether or not I am in the wrong->
Facts - 
1. Wife just gave birth recently to our first child. (Wife’s mom stayed with us for 14days after the birth to help, given we had a C-section)
2. My parents live 10 miles away. We’ve had them over ~3 times since the birth compared to the 14 consecutive days of my MIL.
3. Wife expressed not wanting to socialize or mingle on her first Mother’s Day (ie; doesn’t want to see my Mom or Dad). 

My gut reaction is this is actually a bit selfish in that it’s Mother’s Day (for all mothers) and I would actually like to at LEAST give a hug to my Mom who lives 10 miles away. My wife feels that because it’s her first Mother’s Day that it’s perfectly acceptable to enforce this sort of demand on me. I didn’t know exactly what to do leading up to Mothers Day, but I then became aware that my Mother made a cake and had a card for my wife for her first Mother’s Day. Wife asks me what I think and I respond that maybe they can drop it off, per my dad’s idea, given the gesture of her making a cake, a card, and that she is my mother; would be nice to give her a hug. 

Wife is extremely upset that I shared that idea and believes I am in the wrong for not honoring her request to not see my mom on Mother’s Day. Further more, she says she believes that my mom only made the cake or card so she can see me and our child. She insists that I failed to prioritize her by wanting to share Mother’s Day with my Mom, even with a small gesture like a hug. 

Am I the Asshole for 1. wanting to acknowledge my mom who’s 10 miles away on Mother’s Day and 2. Proactively not honoring her request to not see my mom and 3. massively disagreeing that Mother’s Day from now on doesn’t include my Mom? 

For more context, I ALWAYS support seeing her family and never complain, or suggest it’s too much. When they visit they stay over and I never complain. I really feel like I am not being treated equally. Her mom stayed with us for 14 days after the birth which I graciously supported, given she had a C-section. There is no way on Earth my wife would ever let my mom stay with us for 14days if I had a surgery; this all just feels like she constantly tries to push my parents away. For her to suggest that my Mom only made a cake and card to see me and the child is a horrific thing to suggest, in my opinion.

I am genuinely curious on what I experienced this past Mother’s Day and whether or not I am in the wrong->
Facts - 
1. Wife just gave birth recently to our first child. (Wife’s mom stayed with us for 14days after the birth to help, given we had a C-section)
2. My parents live 10 miles away. We’ve had them over ~3 times since the birth compared to the 14 consecutive days of my MIL.
3. Wife expressed not wanting to socialize or mingle on her first Mother’s Day (ie; doesn’t want to see my Mom or Dad). 

My gut reaction is this is actually a bit selfish in that it’s Mother’s Day (for all mothers) and I would actually like to at LEAST give a hug to my Mom who lives 10 miles away. My wife feels that because it’s her first Mother’s Day that it’s perfectly acceptable to enforce this sort of demand on me. I didn’t know exactly what to do leading up to Mothers Day, but I then became aware that my Mother made a cake and had a card for my wife for her first Mother’s Day. Wife asks me what I think and I respond that maybe they can drop it off, per my dad’s idea, given the gesture of her making a cake, a card, and that she is my mother; would be nice to give her a hug. 

Wife is extremely upset that I shared that idea and believes I am in the wrong for not honoring her request to not see my mom on Mother’s Day. Further more, she says she believes that my mom only made the cake or card so she can see me and our child. She insists that I failed to prioritize her by wanting to share Mother’s Day with my Mom, even with a small gesture like a hug. 

Am I the Asshole for 1. wanting to acknowledge my mom who’s 10 miles away on Mother’s Day and 2. Proactively not honoring her request to not see my mom and 3. massively disagreeing that Mother’s Day from now on doesn’t include my Mom? 

For more context, I ALWAYS support seeing her family and never complain, or suggest it’s too much. When they visit they stay over and I never complain. I really feel like I am not being treated equally. Her mom stayed with us for 14 days after the birth which I graciously supported, given she had a C-section. There is no way on Earth my wife would ever let my mom stay with us for 14days if I had a surgery; this all just feels like she constantly tries to push my parents away. For her to suggest that my Mom only made a cake and card to see me and the child is a horrific thing to suggest, in my opinion. ",0.0,0.9889852,1,0
16,1crh9vh,AITA for confessing exactly why I don't like my parents directly to their faces?,"I (13M) have parents (52F, Mom 50M, Dad) who hound me about every little thing. They tell me exactly when I should take a shower, or brush my teeth, or do chores. They tell me exactly when I should go to bed, which is usually pretty early. Around 9:00 or so. I still go to bed early anyway, because I'm so exhausted, but it's not very nice to know I don't have the option to stay up later if I want to. They hound me about my grades, even if I am passing the class. They do a bunch of other things I can't list because of character limitations. And worst of all, trying to hangout with my friends. I dont know if this is normal, but they make me get my friends parents number to check if it's ok for me to come over. That makes me uncomfortable to get it, and probably them aswell asking for their parents phone number. However, I have 2 friends. They've been family friends for my whole life, and it's easy to contact them to hangout. But with others, it's hard. I already have a small social circle, and it's hard for me to make friends because of my bad reputation, mostly just being weird in the past and people still resent me for it, and my social anxiety. Making friends for me is rare, and my parents make it harder when they need my friend's parent's phone number to check if everything's ok. All this and they still wonder exactly why I don't want to spend time with them at all. 

On the other hand, one could argue I'm just being ungrateful. When we had a talk, which kinda completely ruined my relationship with them, they talked about how they worked hard to give me clothes, food, a house, and stuff like that to live, but it just feels as if they're guilt tripping me. My parents always say they want me to be truthful, but I don't think I should have said anything. It completely ruined my relationship with them. I said I didn't want to be here anymore because they negatively impact my mental health by being too strict, I have to deal with it at school, and I come home and just deal with it more. My dad got really mad, he said stuff like: He didn't care if I hate him, he was being really aggressive, and just looked done with everything. I said I didn't want to be here, I'd rather be somewhere like the streets, and he said I wouldn't survive a week out there. I didn't reply back, but I was thinking about my indomitable human spirit. I don't care if I survive. I either succeed or die trying. I just want to be away from you. That's all I could think. He said I just have to turn 18 and be done with them, but I have to deal with them in the mean time. My mom said that she and my dad are still my parents, and can't just not care about what I do. She didn't really care about what I had to say.

I don't know if I'm just being ungrateful, but it genuinely negatively impacts my mental health that they're so strict. Everyone else has not strict parents, and then there's me. Well that's it.

I always work from home Mondays and Fridays. He's been unemployed for 2.5 months and uses the desk to prep for and take interviews. 

I always work from a chair in the bedroom when he's taking interviews and let him use the desk to prep when he asks- so normally l'm only using the desk 30-60% of the time these days.

Today I knew he didn't have any interviews or planned prep (he said this a few times over the weekend), so I didn't think to ask and was a bit annoyed he gave me so much attitude.

Later that evening, he tells me that I should only have the desk 50% of the day on Mondays and 50% of the day Fridays and he should choose when because i ""have the option to have a desk 100% of the time by going into the office."" He is dead set that this is fair.

I argued he has 7 days a week flexibility to use the desk for what he wants to do. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to have priority to use it 9-5 2 days a week, accommodating for his interview schedule. I’m most productive wfh and it makes my week better all around to do this.

19,1crguuv,AITA for not wanting MIL to babysit anymore?,"I (38F) and husband (39) have a 20month old. Our only. We live near my husband’s parents and from the day our son was born I was heavily pressured into letting my MIL (73) babysit. 

Some backstory on the MIL: she is very frail and old and forgetful. She has bad arthritis and can’t open or close latches with her hands—including things like high chairs, strollers, baby gates, etc. She is also very stubborn and doesn’t really listen to me. She will say “OK” but then not actually do what I’ve asked.  

Early on, when our child was very young, she bumped his head on the table while holding him and made him cry. She also would put random things in his crib as an infant, which we all now know is a big no-no. “We did it when we were parents…” 🙄 needless to say, I held her off for about a year. And it was not easy. 

Over the 8 months, I gave in and agreed to let her babysit one day a week (he’s at a great daycare other four days), and she’s done many other questionable things: pulls his arm too hard, doesn’t change his diaper enough, doesn’t offer him enough food, doesn’t put sunscreen on him, doesn’t use his mittens in the winter. He came home screaming once after she took him for a walk in 30* weather without his mittens, and his hands were bright red. These are all things I remind her of regularly when she’s there (I WFH) and she’s says “ok” but she just doesn’t do them.

Anyway all of this was tolerable until recently when she opened our baby gate (at the top of some very steep and narrow stairs that lead to a hard tiled basement) and didn’t close it properly (on purpose!) because it’s too hard for her to open and re-open with her arthritis. I told her this was unacceptable and very dangerous for our son and she said “ok”, but this just feels like another instance of saying one thing but actually not listening.

Now I’m filled with anxiety whenever she comes over and want to have her stop babysitting altogether. I can’t get work done when she’s in the house because I’m constantly checking whether the gate is closed and if he ate enough,etc,etc.

My husband says he we can’t stop her babysitting because it will break her heart. And I’m like, but what about breaking our kid if she leaves the gate open again???

On Mother’s Day I didn’t have any plans to see my mom because she was supposed to go on a trip that she decided to not go on.

Once I saw the message I once again asked her to come over and she replied that I should be making the effort to come see her instead.

I replied that I just had thought she would want to come over to my place because she usually likes to come here because we have air conditioning. (And she can see my cat)

I didn’t say anything else afterword because it appeared she didn’t want to see me because her message seemed passive aggressive and demanding.

She then said sarcastically “thanks for the effort I will remember this”

I’m confused because I had asked three times to see her but somehow I kept getting aggressive responses, she didn’t even tell me when she was available, to be fair I didn’t really want to ask.

I had bought flowers for her living room but I might just keep them because I don’t really like her tone, but maybe I’m in the wrong and I should have just told her I’m coming over? She lives in an apartment so I can’t just invite myself over to see if she’s home.

24,1crghut,AITA for not inviting someone I don't like to my post-prom plans?,"Hey everyone. 18F here, and I am a current high school senior (so yes, this will be very high school drama-esque). In my area, it's common that, after senior prom, people will go away without parental supervision for the first time for the rest of the weekend.

Earlier this year, I was talking with my cousin and we brainstormed to go to a very similar place in another state as the place most people go tends to be packed and VERY dingy/unsafe because of the type of people such an event attracts. This was a perfect solution, because while I wanted the experience of going somewhere, I'm definitely not the party type and would rather spend the weekend hanging out with friends and relaxing. A few months ago, I ran this idea by my best friend, M (17F). They were really excited by this idea, and the two of us started to plan. We ended up with six people total, including us.

Where the problem comes in is that my friend, M, is also friends with another person, V (17F). V is a very headstrong person that tends to be obnoxious and bossy. She's not a bad person by any means, but is someone that I personally can only handle in small doses. She also tends to take over other peoples' plans, such as taking it upon herself to decide the guest list and everything else for a party she wasn't even hosting, excluding myself and others from the list. She has also borderline bullied me over small things and using her loud voice/bigger figure in a way that would pressure me not to respond or to agree. She has also specifically implied to other people that she does not like me.

I didn't want V to come, because not only do I dislike her, but I fear that she will 'take over' our plans, and make our trip into something it's not. Also, she tends to be a very anxious person, and I do not want her anxiety to be my problem. V tends to be very self-centered, and will bring things that are not about her to make them so that they are. Also, with the obnoxiousness, if I am hypothetically consuming things that wouldn't be particularly allowed, she would only draw attention to our group.

Anyway, the trip. M had half a mind to invite V, but I insisted for reasons above that it was a bad idea, and that V had mentioned she already had plans. This wasn't a total lie, because M did suggest that V was going to go to someone else's house that weekend. After a while, it was apparent that M did feel guilty about not inviting her. I urged her to throw me under the bus and that we were both under the impression that she had other plans, as flaky as they did seem. M did insist on telling V about the trip, which I understood, because she didn't want V to find out over social media and think that M had gone behind her back. Apparently, V didn't respond well, and according to M, she did throw me under the bus as I'd urged her to.

I've been struggling because while I feel O.K. for not inviting V (this trip was my idea, after all), I do feel like a bad friend to M for putting her in the middle.

27,1crfs7l,AITA for expecting my brother to share his inheritance? ,"I (20F) have an adopted brother (29M), my parents always wanted kids but they struggled to conceive and at some point they just gave up and decided to adopt. Few years later, they had me. We lived a very comfortable life as our parents are relatively well off.

All was fine and dandy until my brother went off to college started asking questions about his biological family. This created a huge rift between him and my parents, they didn’t want to give up any informations but he was insistent, they fought constantly and eventually they gave him an ultimatum of **either he gives up on finding his bio parents or they will write him off the will.**

They fought and eventually he decided that he wants to find them above all else and they gave him his bio mom’s contact and he went NC with them ever since. I heard from him periodically and he would talk about his bio mom and their relationship while my resentment grew. 

This was a terrible time for me, I was sad kid and mad at both my parents and my brother. I couldn’t comprehend why my brother preferred meeting a woman that willingly gave him up over keeping the peace in our household. I also resented my parents for making such a stupid ultimatum and breaking our family apart. 

Anyways, my father passed away and true to his word, my brother was not in the will. My brother despite going no contact all those years came to the funeral and patched things up with mom.

Later, My brother asked me to split my inheritance with him because even if my dad hasn’t regarded him as a son the past few years I should still regard him as a brother and share the inheritance. 

I had planned to use the inheritance to finish up my degree debt free, but I just got my family back together and didn’t want to create strife again, i figured it’s a small price to pay to have the family reunited again. 

For a while it was all good within the family and we were happy, until recently my brother’s bio mom passed away and she left everything to my brother, she wasn’t rich by any means but she did leave a substantial amount of money. 

When I heard this news I approached my brother and suggested he splits his inheritance with me as well, as I was struggling financially to put myself through school while his was paid fully by dad+ he got half the inheritance meant for me. 

My brother got very mad at this suggestion and told me I have no ties to his bio mother therefore no claim to her money and I’m being greedy and entitled. We fought about this and mom who was on his side completely and she told me that we share her and dad but his bio parents are his alone therefore I can’t demand he splits his inheritance with me. 

On one hand i understand I’m not entitled to his money on the other I feel like he got an unfair advantage and should be willing to help me out.

So i (16F), have a friend L (16F) that has been recently really rude and kinda cruel to all of our friend group, especially when talking about a school work we are doing (a short film).

Little context: our teacher passed this short film 2 months ago, and we haven't been able to do it yet because everyone is busy or cancels at the last minute.  We only had a date that was more than a month away when we marked that we would record the whole day and finish that, but her bf forgot to tell his parents and one day before told us that he wouldnt be able to go, so we have to cancel, and now we dont have any other days

Because of that, we maybe criated other group without she and her bf to talk about this situation, bc we were all really angry and sad about that, and bc she doesnt let us talk anything just a little bad about him, always defeding this boy like he never do anything bad

Ofc she discovered the groupchat and was (and i think still is) very mad about that, she screamed at us and all, we ask for forgiveness and all, a really shit weekend. But on monday she was ""back to normal"" with me and other friend (we are a group of ten), but was ignoring or being rude to the rest and the couple and others 2 (that werent on the group) kind of distanced themselves from us, okay, good, do what u want

But in the last week she is being really rude to everyone for a lot of Silly reasons (i asked if i could borrow a pencil and she blow up on me saying i was stealing her, for example), and i mean, i now we did a shit think and we are doing everything we can to make she happy, but she just ignores and treat everyone bad

I freaked out this morning, bc tomorrow we are going to record (if everything went smoothly) The rest of the scenes, and she pushed me and say like ""if we cant record tomorrow we (she, bf and friend) arent going to lose other day to do this"" i was ""what? We dont have another day"", and she started ranting that she already lost a lot of robotic and finances class (its a lie, if she did loss those class isnt about this school work, its personal stuff, we always make sure we didnt record on her classes days, the first time is tomorrow), that we (the rest of the group) have to start to do something (we are doing everything, especially me, i did the script, i am the director, she is just the a três that never studies her frases ) to help and bla bla, even blaming me for not reminding her boyfriend every day about the recording like im his mother, and i kinda said that the one useless on this was her, that the other four actors also lost a lot of classes, that she isnt the shiny gold good girl like she is acting she is, and to start being a little more responsible with this work bc its our only grade on the 3⁰ bimester

When it came to the end of ceremony I’ve asked one of them to be the witness and sign off on the paper. Didn’t give it much thought at the time as it just a peace of paper. But then after all was done, I heard a slightly unpleasant remark from the other friend that he is disappointed. Thought it was a joke and I just let it go. 

For the rest of the wedding that friend didn’t engage in any conversations with me and I could feel something is wrong. But since it was my wedding I decided to not think too much and enjoy the day. He also left pretty early which is unlike him as he usually stays till the end. 

Comes next day and I see he removed me from his “friends” on social media and ignores my messages. 

I’m like 100% sure that this is because of the paper thing. But it’s just surprised me that a 30 yo guy would get cheesed over a signature on the paper. 

Not sure if it’s my fault here, and what to do now. He is my best friend after all and I don’t want to lose him over something small like this.

For some back ground…we hosted a small ceremony of about 15 people. Had two of my best friends attend who I knew for about 5 years. One guy is 28 and the other 30. I’ve asked both of them to be my best man at the wedding because i value them both.

32,1crf9n8,AITA for buying something that I knew someone else really wanted?,"I just moved to a new state for an internship and I’m trying to furnish my room. As a young college student (19F) I don’t really have an excess of money to spend so I went to a discount store nearby in search of furniture. Upon walking in my eyes were immediately drawn to this bright orange desk chair in great condition for only $10! I quickly fell in love so I grabbed the chair and pushed it around with me as I looked for other things. 

At one point an employee pulled me aside and told me to “keep an eye on the chair cause someone might try and snag it.” I assumed she was joking so I laughed and moved on. I did make the mistake of leaving the chair unattended while looking at some of the extra discounted items, but when I returned I saw the same employee MOVING the chair! I ran up to confront her and she said she was “just moving it out of the way” (the chair was tucked in a corner, NOT IN THE WAY). I laughed it off and passive aggressively thanked her before making sure the chair was in my sight at ALL times. 

She watched me the rest of the time I was there and when I went to check out she was conveniently at the register right next to the one I was at. She was sharing with her coworker (at a volume just loud enough for me to hear) how she has been needing a chair just like the one I found and how she works a lot, has children, isn’t doing well financially, and how it’s so frustrating to “watch people who can probably afford new items come to the discount store and buy all the good things” (her words). I did start to feel bad a bit cause even though I’m not super wealthy like she assumed, I would be okay without the chair. I’ll admit that I do have a bean bag chair I brought from home that I could use as a place to sit while doing homework. I almost caved and gave the employee the chair until the lady checking me out informed me that she couldn’t sell me the chair because there was no barcode price sticker on it. 

That’s when I knew something was up cause the selling point of the chair for me was the fact that it was $10! How could I have known that if there was not a price on the chair?? So I looked around like a crazy person for the barcode sticker until the employee who previously tried to steal my chair \*magically\* found the sticker. When I tell you I was LIVID. I completed the purchase and marched out with my stuff without offering the employee a thank you for “finding my sticker”. 

Now that I’ve had time to sit back and reflect I do feel bad about how I behaved while leaving. Yes what she did wasn’t cool, but she was an older lady who probably does work a lot and is doing her best to provide for her family, and I’m a college student who’s only gonna be here for a half a year then I’ll probably have to sell the chair when I go home.

33,1crf9b8,AITA for not wanting to visit my fiances family?,"Ok,so my fiance and I are 5 months out from the wedding we'd always hoped for. We are very excited and have a very tight, for the most part healthy relationship. We communicate very well. 
I think our personalities compliment each other, being that I'm the introvert, organized, non risk taker and he's more the extrovert, a little messy, adventurous one. I keep him grounded and he has taught me how to loosen up. He has a 7 year old son, whom I've developed a very special relationship with. We are close and he comes to me when he tends to gravitate toward me. I love him very much. 

For the time being, we are living in a house with his mother to save money for the wedding and a down payment on our own place. The arrangement helps my soon to be MIL, being that she couldn't afford the place on her own. 
I thought I'd develop a close relationship with his family. I don't have a lot of family and I'm grieving the loss of my oldest son, so I really could have gotten used to the support of a family. 
The problem is, his family members one by one have made horrible comments about our relationship, especially his mother. Things like ""well he's just in love with being in love and I worry that he doesn't actually love you."" And, ""he's just obsessed with you until the next thing catches his eye."" 
They all comment about him spending more time with me and his son and less time with them as well. He used to visit his grandmother every week/every other week and fix things in her house. I think that's sweet but what his family would use him for wasn't limited to him doing little things for Grandma around the house. 
It seems they are more upset that he's not doing for them anymore. He's a grown man of 33! Did they not think he'd find someone? 
It's like they're all surprised he's not entirely about them anymore and that's just bizarre to me. 
After hearing this narrative about how it MUST be ME because the changes coincided with us getting together, I decided I would no longer subject myself to their B.S. 
They don't care about our engagement and only his grandma has even asked to see my ring. No one talks about or asks about our wedding planning, yet they see things being delivered and hear us talking about plans, vendors, decor, etc. 
I told him I just don't want to go to his extended family's homes anymore. I still have to endure living with his mother for now, who obviously feels some type of way about her grown man son being grown. I'm exhausted.

My aunt (cousins mom) is paying for the wedding. 

Yesterday at a family gathering for Mother’s Day, my aunt says to me “no funny business at the wedding”

Confused, I asked her to elaborate. She said “none of that gay stuff. No makeup, no nail polish, no fruity outfits, no girly hairstyles… and for god sake grow some hair on your legs. You’re a man and you WILL act like one”

For reference, I’m gender fluid and gender non conforming. I have long (mid back) hair and a short well kept beard. I shave my body hair (except the beard). I don’t wear makeup everyday but I usually have my nails done and my clothing is a mix of both “masculine” and “feminine” attire. 

I’m happy with myself and the way I present myself and have been for many years. This is nothing new, and I’ve never been given grief over it before by any family or friends, including her.  

And, for what it’s worth, the outfit I have picked out for the wedding (which she already saw) is a tux for the ceremony and male dressy beach clothes for the after party. 

Offended, I, “first off, this is not YOUR wedding, second, if this is such a big deal, why was I even invited??” 

She said “I just don’t want to be embarrassed and have the photos ruined”

To which I said, “well I won’t ruin anything because I’m not going” 

She got mad and said I had to because the seating and catering is already set and if I don’t go it will mess it up.

39,1cremzw,WIBTA if I asked my elderly disabled mom to move out,"I currently live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with my fiancé and mom, and 3 cats. My fiancé and I have lived here for approximately 3 years, and we lived together in another apartment before that. 

My mom was renting an apartment with my sister for a few years. Last year my sister moves out to move in with her long term boyfriend. When this happened my fiancé and I allowed my mom to move in with us since she couldn’t afford the rent at her apartment by herself. We never had a set agreed upon date to have her stay with us until because she is on a waitlist for subsidized housing. Well 10 months later and she is still on the waitlist. I recently called to see the status of her on there and she is number 27. She has been on this waitlist since at least November 2022.

My fiancé and I no longer want her here. The room she occupies used to be my game room and I’d like to have it back. We also used to have semi frequent gatherings amongst our friends where we stay up late, party, and some times have intoxicated friends stay over. We no longer do these things to be considerate to her and not to wake her at night. We also don’t have much more space to sleep others with the room she occupies. My mom is mostly independent, however sometimes she gets out of breath and is unable to fetch herself a beverage and will ask me or my fiancé to do this. Sometimes she orders from DoorDash and says she can’t bend down to get her food and asks us to get the door. This isn’t all the time and is more on an adhoc basis dependent on her breathing and how her asthma affecting her at that moment in time. While these things are extremely minor and trivial I’m starting to find them annoying, though I do them without complaint. 


Important note: My aunt (mom’s sister) picks her up once a week and takes her to her house to do her laundry, give her a shower, and they usually do a little shopping. My aunt also takes her to most of her Dr appointments, but I also find myself doing this if the appointment is scheduled for a day I have off.  My aunt gets paid by my mom’s insurance company as a caretaker for doing these things.  Because of the payments being made to my aunt I feel like she should have offered my mom a place to stay when we learned my mom was unable to afford to stay in her old apartment. My mom says the reason my aunt and uncle didn’t offer a room in their house is because my mom stayed with them in the past when she was having health issues and was burdensome, and my uncle didn’t want to deal with her again.


I feel bad at the thought of asking her to leave because she has always been an amazing mother and I love her, however my fiancé and I never get privacy anymore and it has caused more than one fight between us. I feel as if I kicked my mom out one of her two siblings would offer her a room as a last resort, however as if then I’m “forcing them”


My fiancé and I want her gone by the time we get married. Would I be the asshole for asking her to leave by October?",Asshole,2024-05-14,"WIBTA if I asked my elderly disabled mom to move out I currently live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with my fiancé and mom, and 3 cats. My fiancé and I have lived here for approximately 3 years, and we lived together in another apartment before that. 

My mom was renting an apartment with my sister for a few years. Last year my sister moves out to move in with her long term boyfriend. When this happened my fiancé and I allowed my mom to move in with us since she couldn’t afford the rent at her apartment by herself. We never had a set agreed upon date to have her stay with us until because she is on a waitlist for subsidized housing. Well 10 months later and she is still on the waitlist. I recently called to see the status of her on there and she is number 27. She has been on this waitlist since at least November 2022.

My fiancé and I no longer want her here. The room she occupies used to be my game room and I’d like to have it back. We also used to have semi frequent gatherings amongst our friends where we stay up late, party, and some times have intoxicated friends stay over. We no longer do these things to be considerate to her and not to wake her at night. We also don’t have much more space to sleep others with the room she occupies. My mom is mostly independent, however sometimes she gets out of breath and is unable to fetch herself a beverage and will ask me or my fiancé to do this. Sometimes she orders from DoorDash and says she can’t bend down to get her food and asks us to get the door. This isn’t all the time and is more on an adhoc basis dependent on her breathing and how her asthma affecting her at that moment in time. While these things are extremely minor and trivial I’m starting to find them annoying, though I do them without complaint.

41,1crej9o,WIBTA if i bring all of this up and ask why i am being left out? Is it worth my energy?,"senior year rolls along and over the summer they make plans to go to go abroad for the winter break and im invited. i am initially hesitant but later convinced to go, however, i ended up going with close high school friends instead.

the fall semester rolls along and i stop cooking for the grils, so one of the girls spends time at her bfs dorm (the guys dorm) more often bc he will cook for her. the guys dorm start to bond much more and they cook together as well. i miss out, bc i cook in my own dorm (fomo vibes but its natural). it didnt bother me until they all went out biking one night without me. everyone knows i love biking and the fact that i didnt get invited did make me a little sad but it was whatever. it does sound kinda silly to be upset over but its the truth.

winter break happens then spring break is around the corner and weve always had talks of going on a senior trip. one might argue that the senior trip was the abroad trip but not everyone was invited and not everyone did go. so i bring up the idea of going to a city for a few days. i invite everyone. some people drop bc of monetary reasons and some are unavailable. one specific person we will name A, says that they will only go if one of the guys from the dorm go. This was insulting bc if we are friends why does another guy specifically from his dorm have to go? the only guy from the dorm who was still potentially able to go was F. F complained that there was no step by step itinerary and that there was nothing to do in said city bc he interned there and it was boring. I told him that I would create an itinerary as soon as i get a final head count so I can reserve certain airbnbs and plan accordingly. F and I go back and forth to which he inevitably drops. the trip still happens

during the end of spring break, the guys dorm go out and have lunch in our hometowns. again no invite, bc i was at the dorms. but i hv suspicious that theyve been already planning to hang out anyways, and had they asked i wudve moved back into my dorm later.

fast forward i bump into them and they are on their way to an outing for lunch. they said that the reason i wasnt invited was because it was just a guys dorm thing + the gf since she is over all the time. they explained they a suite bonding experience

fast forward its finals season and A, F, and I are in the same class together. i ask to do a group study to which they both agree to. the next day rolls along and no one mentions anything, so i ask if they were studying together and they were. ??? so no invite. and today same story, they went to study tog w/o me.

42,1crehog,AITA for not giving my teammates credit?,"I (25 years old) was recently promoted and transferred to a new department. While learning, a colleague showed me a database that no one was using. I saw an opportunity to perform a meaningful analysis.

This analysis gradually took shape until it reached the senior management. I presented the work, they liked it, and I formalized it by email, sharing the file. In the email, I informed them that I had studied the behavior of a specific object of interest and developed a report based on it, using a database that had already been created by the team.

Then, a team member told me that this was a profound lack of ethics, as I was formalizing that I had created the entire analysis alone and excluded the rest of the team, portraying a negative image to them.

I chose not to argue, but it bothered me. I had to alter 80% of the existing Excel database because it contained many unnecessary formulas taking up memory, I collected the data from scratch, did the calculations, analyses, and presented the report by myself. I applied statistical concepts, techniques, and tools that are well beyond our job scope. I spent nearly a month working on this; I showed them earlier, and none even asked if they could help in any way.

Additionally, some other important points:

- I knew this would bother some people, modesty aside, the work turned out pretty high quality and much above what is expected from my position. I also did not expect any support to keep it going. I also do not think that not giving credit would negatively impact them, as it was not expected from the job.
- I am aware that there is a ""corporate etiquette"" of saying that everything is a team effort. However, due to some past traumas and personal goals, I preferred to keep the project individual and was honest that I had done the work alone.

43,1crehfk,WIBTA For Not allowing my daughter to give her friend a phone?,"I (43F) have a daughter (14F). I'll call my daughter Amelia and her friend (14F/15F) Amy. 

  
Amy is a very kind and respectful girl, at least in my opinion. Amy and Amelia have known each other for almost 10 years, and are very close. Amy is over our house very frequently, since her parents work nights and are sleeping all day (I think so) and her only sibling has moved out of the house, so she just stays with us. While all this seems all well and good, Amy's parents are very strict. She doesn't have a phone, she isn't allowed to play video games, she has to study for an hour everyday (Ok, i can get behind this one, I make my kids do this too, but not for an hour), stuff like that. 

  
Recently my daughter got a new phone. My husband was being a dummy when he bought it, because he bought it in full instead of trading in her old phone for the new one. Because of this, Amelia asked if she could give her old phone to her friend, just as something to use so she can still connect with her. I obviously knew she wanted Amy to lie to her parents about it. I know that's something I'd do too, but it's just not my place to go against another parent. After telling her this, she kept pleading and pleading and I told her I'd take some time to think it over.

44,1creffo,AITA For Putting My Brother Out,"


Im 22(f) with a small child(5) I moved out of my parents home a year ago and my brother (21) moved in with me a short time after I got my apartment under the agreement that he would watch my child while I work. There is not written or any kind of physical evidence for this agreement that said my brother in the beginning had done very well with being there and watching my child however lately that isn’t the case. He’s often late returning home which in turn makes me late for work.
 
Just recently when this occurred again I had taken steps to try and Insure him being on time I texted him hours before my shift and even called almost an hour before my shift to ask if he’d be home on time to which he said yes. He shows up 2 minutes before I have to be at my job clocking in. Instead of apologizing for being late he asks why didn’t I just leave. Mind you he is there to watch my child while I work and I work overnight. 

  I talked to him about it and he says he doesn’t know what time he should be here and that I need to tell him what on time is even tho he’s lived with me for a year and I’ve worked the exact same job and hours since he’s been here and he knows what time I have to be at work. During the discussion he said that since I was the one with the car I should drop my son off with him wherever he is at. To which I responded with since you don’t have a car then you should have already been here. He then tells me that I’m trying to shackle him to my child and how I don’t even work that much. (I only work about 2days out of the week always overnights) He said that he had rushed to get here and said rushing took 46 minutes even though he was not even 24minutes away from home to begin with and how he had to wait on our best friend to get ready so they could bring him back home. He made no attempt to call and say that he’d be late and when I brought that up he said well you have my location.

Just last night upon my arrival to work he sent me a text saying “just to be late” which I can only assume was referring to the time I arrived at my job which in fact was properly on time. I told him that me letting him stay the rest of the month with me was also out me being kind and that I again wasn’t shackling him to anything and the he could leave expeditiously.

Furthermore when first moving into my apartment I made one rule and that rule was no getting spicy while my son is home a rule which he has broken multiple times with different women and causing my son to ask me some very uncomfortable questions and make very unsettling statements.

AITA for how I’m handling the situation and telling him to leave by June 1?
