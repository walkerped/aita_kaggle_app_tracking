0,1crvzfi,AITAH for uninviting my son's stepmom to his grad party?,"Backstory: My (37F) son (17M) has a very strained relationship with his father and stepmom. He is trans (FtM) and they are Catholic, so they refuse to accept his transition and call him by his dead name and pronouns. He lives with me full time after having a huge fight with them shortly after coming out. (He used to live with them 50/50). His father is quite passive, and stepmom is a narcissist. He goes along with everything she says. 

My son is graduating in a month. He just handed out invites to his grad party. Shortly after giving one to his dad and stepmom, Stepmom text my son about his grades and if he is even graduating. (My son doesn't have the best GPA but he is on track to graduate). She was extremely condescending on the texts and asked if he needed to come stay with her and dad because obviously I wasn't tracking his grades well enough. 

He sent me the texts, and I kindly text her back, saying I appreciate the concern, but he is on track to graduate and I have it handled. And that in the future, I wish she would text more about his day then to just get on him about grades. And that it hurts him that she seemingly only reaches out when something is wrong. She then responded with a snarky that she can see the grades and she called the school, and that DEAD NAME'S counselor is also concerned about his grades. And that she texts DEAD NAME all the time. (She does not. My son tells me every time her or dad text or call). 

After that, I blew up on her. I told her his name is PREFERRED NAME and his pronouns are He/Him and it's time she respected that. She countered with "" You are a fucking idiot. You can't change your sex, you fucking moron. You have her so brainwashed, it's pathetic.""

After that, I told her not to bother coming to the grad party and that she was uninvited. She said ""Try and stop me."" 

My son was pretty upset about the whole thing afterwards, and had a bit of a mental health spiral. I think he is afraid that his dad won't come now. 

So, Am I the asshole? Obviously, I was just trying to protect my son. I have been civil and compliant of this narcissistic bitch for years and I can't keep letting her talk to my son the way she does anymore. I'm starting to think maybe I should have just ignored her to stay civil until after graduation. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-05-14,"AITAH for uninviting my son's stepmom to his grad party?

Few things I should have mentioned in my last post but i didn't- Not all people were against me many supported me my fault for not mentioning it also this happens a lot in Asian families and honestly I was surprised it's so rare everywhere else lol.
Well I found how my MIL came to know about my stretchmarks. My husband casually mentioned in a chat he had with her and it turns out she barely has any stretch marks on her (superior genetics I guess...) and surprise, surprise for some reason she hates me and she tried to turn my husband against me by telling him that's it not normal and I must be doing something wrong and that it can be harmful for the baby (the audacity). I guess it
worked my husband also started doubting and pestering me about it.
I had a long chat with my husband about it and he's agreed to try to work things out starting with marriage counseling as many of you suggested and I also twisted his arm to go to individual therapy. We are still living separately and to make things clear he has never abused me before this incident though thanks to you all I realized
how condescending his family was towards me subtly.
He has agreed to go NC with them and we won't be
allowing them to visit the baby. I have told him that if things don't work out divorce is still very much an option for me so I hope it doesn't get to it.
Anyways thank you all for your advice, it helped me so much and i hope it all works out for me :) ",UPDATE,2024-05-14,"Update- ""AITA for shouting at my husband at a family gathering"" Link to the original post- https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/LWlDkdBbLW

4,1criihz,AITA for yelling at my foster mother during a doctor visit?,"To give a bit of a backstory, I have been experiencing pain in my body for about 2 years of my life, I then entered care last year in January. Since I entered care the pain has gotten increasingly worse. It happens everywhere in my body on my fingers, wrists, ankles, thighs, feet, head, ears, arms, back, and especially my chest as the pain can be so terrible I can not function properly. Certain tasks such as work, cleaning, and moving have become so stressful and painful that I have to sleep/rest for hours just to regain some strength. To top it off, every 3-5 days I get fever-like symptoms, but when test results such as my temperature are checked everything is normal. 

The Doctors who would at first give me simple medication assuming it was just sprains or anxiety. I disagreed with their opinions and refused to take the medication. We tried countless doctors until we went to a new one an hour away and they took some blood tests, only thing that came up different was I had a positive ANA test result. The pain worsened And as it did I would complain only to be told by my mother to stop my complaining, that she doesn't care and I shouldn't tell her because she can't do anything.

The Same doctor who took the blood test gave me medication. I took 6 medications I would take for about 4 weeks. The pain unfortunately continued to occur with an increase of headaches than normal and I was exhausted. 

Today we went to the same doctor to follow up on the medicine. I told the doctor how I felt during the medication, and after that my foster parent and doctor went outside the room, I heard them talk about how it was all in my head and that I had psychological problems. When they came into the room I told them I wasn't lying about the pain. They reassured me they didn't think I was lying but then my foster mom went into what they said “We don't think you're lying, we think it's in your head. You pick and choose medication and you only feel better when you get things.” When I tell you I blew up, I blew up. I yelled at my foster mother “How dare you say something like that! You just implied that I'm lying about it!” I continued to yell at her “You don't know anything about me!”

To me personally when she said I only feel better when I get things it makes it seem like I fake the pain so I can get out of things or get things. She then compared me to the gypsy Rose situation and said it was similar. I was now enraged, I told her if I ever found out what I had and it was something that wasn't in my head, she was going to apologize. They left the room, and I just started crying.

This foster mother had the tendency to tell others it was all in my head like my case worker and CASA (court representative) .

5,1cridri,AITA for simply texting Happy Mother's Day to my mother whom I just met for the first time in a few weeks ago after not seeing her for 33 years? ,"You read that right. When I was 6, my mom lost custody of my brother and I, and after that happened I didn't see her ever again up until a few weeks ago. She got married traveled the world and lived her life. I spoke to her on the phone on and off over the past few years but we always lost touch with one another. She finally agreed (after flaking out many times on previous plans) for us to meet and it was a neutral experience in my eyes. I honestly felt pretty resentful to see how amazing her life ended up turning out and how happy she seemed while my brother and I were mentally, sexually, physically, and emotionally abused in our childhood by our father and stepmother. Also, when I was 15 my father left our family and my stepmother no longer wanted to care for us so I ended up in the system and ultimately on my own from that point forward. Life was a freaking struggle and I didn't have anyone to call to help me in times where I could have used the help. I felt resentful towards her for being so carefree and naive about life when I was in her presence. She casually threw around how she owned several homes and traveled the world and how financially free and set up she and her husband were. ***I just hated hearing it***. The kicker to me was that she had the nerve to judge my brother and me for how we turned out and what we chose to do with our lives. Neither one of us are college educated but both of us are entrepreneurs. My brother is a millionaire and I'm still not in a space (yet) where my business has taken off and I'm bartending and waiting tables on the side (she's been criticizing me for this and telling me I need to get a real job). 

This woman just doesn't get it. She even had the nerve to talk about my parenting (I had a child in high school and dropped out BUT I RAISED HER and she turned out to be a pretty damn good gal-She's currently in the Navy and I couldn't be more proud-plus she is such a daddy's girl and I am so proud that I was able to break a generational family curse two-fold). 

Anyway, I was dreading Mother's day this year TBH, I knew she was going to expect a grand gesture from me and I just sent a text that said ""Happy Mother's Day."" She ignored the text and responded back today telling me I was pathetic for such a dry and unthoughtful Mother's Day gesture and that she deserved more than that from me. 

She even got my brother involved and my brother told me I should have done more.

  
I'm so confused. Isn't Mother's Day for mothers who raised their children or am I nuts?

We met in person during work and have been friends since then. He got a more close friend (D) and they grew up together but they also have a on and off friendship. I tried to be neutral but at the end i was more supportive to him (A) because i think sometimes you just need to vent and his childhood friend (D) did fuck up pretty often. You can share games on PS5 i played some of his games and he some of mine. After a big fight between them they began to spend time together again and i felt a little left alone but that's just me making something bigger than it is. Today i entered the voice chat and with a annoyed and frustrated tine he demanded that i deactivate his account on my console to stop the sharing. I was really upset that this came out of nowhere with really dumb reasons so i said that this is childish and deactivated it after leaving the voicechat. His reasons:
- I open his profile to see what he plays
- I make comments that he buys some games physical instead of digital ( yes it was a bummer sometimes but i didn't make it a big deal)
- I asked about games he privated to hide them because of his personal reasons (that happened once and i was just curious about his progress but as i notices he didn't want to talk about it i stopped the same moment)

I believe he just wanted to share with his childhood friend (D) again and used those points that he had problems with as an excuse

My biggest problem is he never talked about those things with me and suddenly came with all that stuff all at once and thats really disrespectful towards our friendship and thats why u was really upset.

7,1cri6ds,AITA for telling my girlfriend that she needs to stand up to the partner she's living with?,"Hello everyone. My only request is that you try to be nice.

I (28 F) am in a poly relationship with my BF (20 M) and my GF (23 F). Bf and gf are in a side relationship with another gf, we'll call her OGF. BF and GF have been in a relationship for 2 years and I only joined recently (About 3 months ago). GF ended up moving in with OGF a couple of months ago.

From the stories I have been told from GF and my brother and from my own personal experiences with OGF, I have come to realize that OGF is controlling to a toxic degree and I feel very strongly about it. According to GF herself, OGF gives very stern warnings for everything, especially about how GF treats OGF's dog, who, in accordance to brother, is treated better than GF. He learned this from things GF has told him directly.

I have decided to support GF with the help of BF and brother. We recently told GF that if she wanted things to change, she needed to stand up to OGF and stand her ground. For context, GF is essentially a doormat. In verbal altercations, she tends to back down whenever her opponent shows any degree more fight than her. I am concerned that OGF is walking all over GF and GF is just letting it happen, knowingly, because she doesn't feel like she can do anything about it.

I am trying to help her be able to stand up on her own and we got in a fight recently where I told her to grow a spine after listening to her talk about how she hadn't eaten but didn't want to eat because she was afraid of making too much noise and waking up OGF. GF then yelled at me, saying it was similar to something brother said after an argument they had, saying it was condescending.

AITA for telling GF she needs to grow a spine and take care of herself?

Edit:

GF, BF, and I live in three separate states though we have talked about getting a place together. Since I'm still fairly new to the dynamic, those talks have been few and far between.

Update: Last night before bed, I came to my own conclusion that IWTA and I talked to her about it. She said that both of us could have handled it differently and we had a nice chat. I read all the comments this morning and want to clarify a couple of things. I noted in one comment last night that I had left out what I had seen as ""minor details"". They are minor to me but I guess for clarification sake they are major.

1: GF and I have tried for a relationship twice before and neither of us were in the right headspace for it at the time. I have known GF for going on 2 years.

2: I would like to note that this is not the way I talk to just anyone. I took this approach with GF last night because this sort of thing usually works. She explained to me last night that that particular phrase held a bit of trauma for her and was why she reacted the way she did.

Think of me how you want. I am who I am and I know where I stand. This was more so a thing I did in the heat of the moment to vent some stress and will probably be taken down this weekend anyway.",Asshole,2024-05-14,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she needs to stand up to the partner she's living with?

I (28 F) am in a poly relationship with my BF (20 M) and my GF (23 F). Bf and gf are in a side relationship with another gf, we'll call her OGF. BF and GF have been in a relationship for 2 years and I only joined recently (About 3 months ago). GF ended up moving in with OGF a couple of months ago.

From the stories I have been told from GF and my brother and from my own personal experiences with OGF, I have come to realize that OGF is controlling to a toxic degree and I feel very strongly about it. According to GF herself, OGF gives very stern warnings for everything, especially about how GF treats OGF's dog, who, in accordance to brother, is treated better than GF. He learned this from things GF has told him directly.

I have decided to support GF with the help of BF and brother. We recently told GF that if she wanted things to change, she needed to stand up to OGF and stand her ground. For context, GF is essentially a doormat. In verbal altercations, she tends to back down whenever her opponent shows any degree more fight than her. I am concerned that OGF is walking all over GF and GF is just letting it happen, knowingly, because she doesn't feel like she can do anything about it.

I am trying to help her be able to stand up on her own and we got in a fight recently where I told her to grow a spine after listening to her talk about how she hadn't eaten but didn't want to eat because she was afraid of making too much noise and waking up OGF. GF then yelled at me, saying it was similar to something brother said after an argument they had, saying it was condescending.

AITA for telling GF she needs to grow a spine and take care of herself?

Edit:

GF, BF, and I live in three separate states though we have talked about getting a place together. Since I'm still fairly new to the dynamic, those talks have been few and far between.

Update: Last night before bed, I came to my own conclusion that IWTA and I talked to her about it. She said that both of us could have handled it differently and we had a nice chat. I read all the comments this morning and want to clarify a couple of things. I noted in one comment last night that I had left out what I had seen as ""minor details"". They are minor to me but I guess for clarification sake they are major.

1: GF and I have tried for a relationship twice before and neither of us were in the right headspace for it at the time. I have known GF for going on 2 years.

2: I would like to note that this is not the way I talk to just anyone. I took this approach with GF last night because this sort of thing usually works. She explained to me last night that that particular phrase held a bit of trauma for her and was why she reacted the way she did.

Think of me how you want. I am who I am and I know where I stand. This was more so a thing I did in the heat of the moment to vent some stress and will probably be taken down this weekend anyway.",1.0,1.0635786,1,1

**For context** the relationship between my ex and I is contentious so i try not to talk to her unless it’s about the kids. We just had a 3 year court battle with kid withholding, a lot of her accusing me of being a bad dad and dangerous and me ultimately gaining primary custody.  Our 15 year old son lives with us and sees his mom every other weekend.  I pay for everything and it’s been hard getting her to even pay for some medical fees, though to be fair she buys him nice clothes and 200 dollar jordans occasionally.

I had a trip planned for ages over memorial day which is my ex’s weekend - when all of a sudden our son tells me last month his friend asked him to be in a quinceneara end of may. No details, nothing on time, just the date. I told him its his moms weekend and he needs to talk to her about it which he keeps claiming he did, as she even took him to a practice on her weekend. I also mentioned it to her.

I finally got the friend’s parent’s number out of my son this week and texted asking for details. Turns out it won’t end until 10-1030 pm and then they are driving the kids back to our city which is 45 min away making it super late for my ex to pick him up.  I told her i can arrange for him to sleepover at his friends house that he sleeps over at often who will also he at the quince and she can get him the next morning if that’s easier.

So now she is mad at me saying I’m a bad co-parent and why am I going out of town, she would have preferred to switch weekends if she knew it was so late and she had to drive an hour, that he is 15 years old and too young to be out until 12 am (and shouldn’t be sleeping over at friend’s houses).  I think we landed on her picking him up from the quince early because she doesn’t want him staying out but I feel like this is still somehow my fault because of how mad she was, like I should have cancelled my vacation or something and just taken the hit financially or shouldn’t have gone in the first place or should I have just told my son he couldn’t go to the quince?

9,1cri1ms,AITA for having had feelings for my now-girlfriend while she was already in a relationship?,"I (26, M) met my now-girlfriend (26, F) of five months when I went to university for my post-graduation. We immediately clicked and became good friends. Soon after, I developed romantic feelings for her.

I confessed my feelings to her earlier last year, to which she said that she was not in a position to offer me anything more than friendship as she was committed to someone else.

I thought I could control my feelings and distance myself from her, but I couldn’t help myself. I enjoyed talking to her and spending time with her, and she enjoyed my company as well. We would spend a big part of our day together in college, then hang out after college was over. We also went out frequently, and over time, we grew closer. Everyone in our college could sense that I had feelings for her, and she was aware of it too. She repeatedly told me not to expect anything more than friendship from her, but at this point, we had become more than just friends. Later on, she even admitted that she had some feelings for me as well, but she couldn't offer anything beyond friendship because she already had someone else in her life whom she loved a lot. Given the circumstances, it was very confusing for me to define our relationship because clearly, we were more than friends, but we were not a couple. At this point, I realized that what we had going was a situationship. Ironically, many people in our college thought we were a couple.

Our closeness didn’t sit well with her boyfriend, leading to frequent arguments between them over me. Eventually, their relationship deteriorated to the point where he became abusive. This led her to stop seeing and talking to him, for which he held me responsible. He feared that she might get involved with me, and to deter me from pursuing her, he even sent me some of her private pictures, intending to imply that both of them had been physically intimate.

Eventually, she broke up with him, and naturally, it was a very traumatic time in her life. I tried to support her during this period, and eventually, we grew even closer. Some time later, we entered into a relationship.

Now, here’s the thing, last night I made a remark about her now-ex, to which she responded that I shouldn't say anything bad about him. I asked her how she could still respect him after whatever had happened, to which she told me that he had loved her a lot and that she felt guilty for causing him pain by being close to me. She then started blaming me, saying that because of me, she couldn’t spend quality time with him. She claimed that the time that he deserved, she gave to me. She even said that at times, she avoided going to his place for fear that I might question her whereabouts. She didn’t want me to know she was meeting him.

12,1crhofz,AITA for telling my friend we had a sleepover without them?,"I (18F) and my friend, Becca (18NB) were on the phone a few nights ago. I was talking about our school dance that we recently had.

For context, Becca hasn't been in my main friend group because they aren't in our group chat (It's a stupid rule, but its whatever). Everyone in our groupchat is friends with Becca, except for one person, Izzy, who, for whatever reason, doesn't like them. Izzy was hosting the afterparty for the dance. Becca and my mutual friend Francie have a group chat together. After Francie and I had begged Izzy to let Becca come to the afterparty because they were taking photos with us before the dance anyways, Izzy finally gave in, but said that Becca wasn't allowed to sleepover.

I don't really understand Izzy's deal with Becca, she seems to be the only person who doesn't like Becca all that much in our friend group, even though Becca is a genuinely kind person who loves talking to people and loves making friends. Becca and I frequently talk on the phone at night and debrief, and a few nights ago was one of those nights. I was talking to Becca about Izzy's deal with them and spilling the tea, so to speak, and it just kind of slipped out that there was a sleepover they weren't invited to. They started getting upset and was saying things like ""Oh my gosh I totally embarassed myself in front of everyone"" and ""You and Francie lied to me, everyone lied to me."" I was really trying my hardest to comfort them, but then I started hearing their voice quiver. I asked if they were okay, and they sadly said ""I think I'm going to go"" in tears, and then hung up immediately after. I texted them multiple times afterwards, but I still haven't gotten a response.

I genuinely feel so awful about this, I regret not telling them before, and I regret not pushing harder with Izzy to let Becca sleepover. I regret most of all seemingly putting a strain on our relationship, I truly love Becca and I really hope they aren't too upset with me.

I want to make it clear here that the sleepover was at Izzy's house, so I couldn't just invite Becca to stay because it wasn't my house and ultimately wasn't up to me.

I again, want to say how much I love Becca, and I know that if I added them to our group chat Izzy would freak out and remove them or get really upset with me.

Anyways, I've tried to lose weight without any success (usually the opposite affect) quite a few times, but I've found that the only thing that's helped hold me somewhat accountable is weight checks. 

My family isn't very supportive of my weight loss attempts, they don't let me cook my own meals, nor do they eat healthy as a whole family, and I am often forced to get seconds or even thirds when I say I don't want more. Calorie counting, while a great tool for some, made me feel powerless since I am not allowed to dictate my own diet, and it was mainly counterproductive for me. Every morning since January, I've made a daily trek down to my parents room in order to step on their scale and weigh myself. By about late February, my parents caught on to what I was doing and no longer allow me in there in the morning (I used to bring them coffee, sit in bed with my mom and talk, and occasionally have her help do my crazy thick wavy hair). This really caused me to regress in my weight loss attempts and I gained a whopping 10 pounds in the past few months.

However, when I told my parents this, they freaked out. They said that I have an unhealthy relationship with food and that it's irresponsible of me to want a scale. It would send my younger sisters a bad message (they don't even share a bathroom with me) against body positivity and that they did not raise me to be a girl who is obsessed with her weight.

15,1crh9vn,"AITA for wanting to acknowledge my own Mother on Mothers Day alongside my wife, given the fact this is my wife’s first Mother Day after the birth of our first child a few weeks ago?","I am genuinely curious on what I experienced this past Mother’s Day and whether or not I am in the wrong->
Facts - 
1. Wife just gave birth recently to our first child. (Wife’s mom stayed with us for 14days after the birth to help, given we had a C-section)
2. My parents live 10 miles away. We’ve had them over ~3 times since the birth compared to the 14 consecutive days of my MIL.
3. Wife expressed not wanting to socialize or mingle on her first Mother’s Day (ie; doesn’t want to see my Mom or Dad). 

My gut reaction is this is actually a bit selfish in that it’s Mother’s Day (for all mothers) and I would actually like to at LEAST give a hug to my Mom who lives 10 miles away. My wife feels that because it’s her first Mother’s Day that it’s perfectly acceptable to enforce this sort of demand on me. I didn’t know exactly what to do leading up to Mothers Day, but I then became aware that my Mother made a cake and had a card for my wife for her first Mother’s Day. Wife asks me what I think and I respond that maybe they can drop it off, per my dad’s idea, given the gesture of her making a cake, a card, and that she is my mother; would be nice to give her a hug. 

Wife is extremely upset that I shared that idea and believes I am in the wrong for not honoring her request to not see my mom on Mother’s Day. Further more, she says she believes that my mom only made the cake or card so she can see me and our child. She insists that I failed to prioritize her by wanting to share Mother’s Day with my Mom, even with a small gesture like a hug. 

Am I the Asshole for 1. wanting to acknowledge my mom who’s 10 miles away on Mother’s Day and 2. Proactively not honoring her request to not see my mom and 3. massively disagreeing that Mother’s Day from now on doesn’t include my Mom? 

For more context, I ALWAYS support seeing her family and never complain, or suggest it’s too much. When they visit they stay over and I never complain. I really feel like I am not being treated equally. Her mom stayed with us for 14 days after the birth which I graciously supported, given she had a C-section. There is no way on Earth my wife would ever let my mom stay with us for 14days if I had a surgery; this all just feels like she constantly tries to push my parents away. For her to suggest that my Mom only made a cake and card to see me and the child is a horrific thing to suggest, in my opinion.

I am genuinely curious on what I experienced this past Mother’s Day and whether or not I am in the wrong->
Facts - 
1. Wife just gave birth recently to our first child. (Wife’s mom stayed with us for 14days after the birth to help, given we had a C-section)
2. My parents live 10 miles away. We’ve had them over ~3 times since the birth compared to the 14 consecutive days of my MIL.
3. Wife expressed not wanting to socialize or mingle on her first Mother’s Day (ie; doesn’t want to see my Mom or Dad). 

My gut reaction is this is actually a bit selfish in that it’s Mother’s Day (for all mothers) and I would actually like to at LEAST give a hug to my Mom who lives 10 miles away. My wife feels that because it’s her first Mother’s Day that it’s perfectly acceptable to enforce this sort of demand on me. I didn’t know exactly what to do leading up to Mothers Day, but I then became aware that my Mother made a cake and had a card for my wife for her first Mother’s Day. Wife asks me what I think and I respond that maybe they can drop it off, per my dad’s idea, given the gesture of her making a cake, a card, and that she is my mother; would be nice to give her a hug. 

Wife is extremely upset that I shared that idea and believes I am in the wrong for not honoring her request to not see my mom on Mother’s Day. Further more, she says she believes that my mom only made the cake or card so she can see me and our child. She insists that I failed to prioritize her by wanting to share Mother’s Day with my Mom, even with a small gesture like a hug. 

Am I the Asshole for 1. wanting to acknowledge my mom who’s 10 miles away on Mother’s Day and 2. Proactively not honoring her request to not see my mom and 3. massively disagreeing that Mother’s Day from now on doesn’t include my Mom? 

For more context, I ALWAYS support seeing her family and never complain, or suggest it’s too much. When they visit they stay over and I never complain. I really feel like I am not being treated equally. Her mom stayed with us for 14 days after the birth which I graciously supported, given she had a C-section. There is no way on Earth my wife would ever let my mom stay with us for 14days if I had a surgery; this all just feels like she constantly tries to push my parents away. For her to suggest that my Mom only made a cake and card to see me and the child is a horrific thing to suggest, in my opinion. ",0.0,0.9889852,1,0
16,1crh9vh,AITA for confessing exactly why I don't like my parents directly to their faces?,"I (13M) have parents (52F, Mom 50M, Dad) who hound me about every little thing. They tell me exactly when I should take a shower, or brush my teeth, or do chores. They tell me exactly when I should go to bed, which is usually pretty early. Around 9:00 or so. I still go to bed early anyway, because I'm so exhausted, but it's not very nice to know I don't have the option to stay up later if I want to. They hound me about my grades, even if I am passing the class. They do a bunch of other things I can't list because of character limitations. And worst of all, trying to hangout with my friends. I dont know if this is normal, but they make me get my friends parents number to check if it's ok for me to come over. That makes me uncomfortable to get it, and probably them aswell asking for their parents phone number. However, I have 2 friends. They've been family friends for my whole life, and it's easy to contact them to hangout. But with others, it's hard. I already have a small social circle, and it's hard for me to make friends because of my bad reputation, mostly just being weird in the past and people still resent me for it, and my social anxiety. Making friends for me is rare, and my parents make it harder when they need my friend's parent's phone number to check if everything's ok. All this and they still wonder exactly why I don't want to spend time with them at all. 

On the other hand, one could argue I'm just being ungrateful. When we had a talk, which kinda completely ruined my relationship with them, they talked about how they worked hard to give me clothes, food, a house, and stuff like that to live, but it just feels as if they're guilt tripping me. My parents always say they want me to be truthful, but I don't think I should have said anything. It completely ruined my relationship with them. I said I didn't want to be here anymore because they negatively impact my mental health by being too strict, I have to deal with it at school, and I come home and just deal with it more. My dad got really mad, he said stuff like: He didn't care if I hate him, he was being really aggressive, and just looked done with everything. I said I didn't want to be here, I'd rather be somewhere like the streets, and he said I wouldn't survive a week out there. I didn't reply back, but I was thinking about my indomitable human spirit. I don't care if I survive. I either succeed or die trying. I just want to be away from you. That's all I could think. He said I just have to turn 18 and be done with them, but I have to deal with them in the mean time. My mom said that she and my dad are still my parents, and can't just not care about what I do. She didn't really care about what I had to say.

I don't know if I'm just being ungrateful, but it genuinely negatively impacts my mental health that they're so strict. Everyone else has not strict parents, and then there's me. Well that's it.

I always work from home Mondays and Fridays. He's been unemployed for 2.5 months and uses the desk to prep for and take interviews. 

I always work from a chair in the bedroom when he's taking interviews and let him use the desk to prep when he asks- so normally l'm only using the desk 30-60% of the time these days.

Today I knew he didn't have any interviews or planned prep (he said this a few times over the weekend), so I didn't think to ask and was a bit annoyed he gave me so much attitude.

Later that evening, he tells me that I should only have the desk 50% of the day on Mondays and 50% of the day Fridays and he should choose when because i ""have the option to have a desk 100% of the time by going into the office."" He is dead set that this is fair.

I argued he has 7 days a week flexibility to use the desk for what he wants to do. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to have priority to use it 9-5 2 days a week, accommodating for his interview schedule. I’m most productive wfh and it makes my week better all around to do this.

19,1crguuv,AITA for not wanting MIL to babysit anymore?,"I (38F) and husband (39) have a 20month old. Our only. We live near my husband’s parents and from the day our son was born I was heavily pressured into letting my MIL (73) babysit. 

Some backstory on the MIL: she is very frail and old and forgetful. She has bad arthritis and can’t open or close latches with her hands—including things like high chairs, strollers, baby gates, etc. She is also very stubborn and doesn’t really listen to me. She will say “OK” but then not actually do what I’ve asked.  

Early on, when our child was very young, she bumped his head on the table while holding him and made him cry. She also would put random things in his crib as an infant, which we all now know is a big no-no. “We did it when we were parents…” 🙄 needless to say, I held her off for about a year. And it was not easy. 

Over the 8 months, I gave in and agreed to let her babysit one day a week (he’s at a great daycare other four days), and she’s done many other questionable things: pulls his arm too hard, doesn’t change his diaper enough, doesn’t offer him enough food, doesn’t put sunscreen on him, doesn’t use his mittens in the winter. He came home screaming once after she took him for a walk in 30* weather without his mittens, and his hands were bright red. These are all things I remind her of regularly when she’s there (I WFH) and she’s says “ok” but she just doesn’t do them.

Anyway all of this was tolerable until recently when she opened our baby gate (at the top of some very steep and narrow stairs that lead to a hard tiled basement) and didn’t close it properly (on purpose!) because it’s too hard for her to open and re-open with her arthritis. I told her this was unacceptable and very dangerous for our son and she said “ok”, but this just feels like another instance of saying one thing but actually not listening.

Now I’m filled with anxiety whenever she comes over and want to have her stop babysitting altogether. I can’t get work done when she’s in the house because I’m constantly checking whether the gate is closed and if he ate enough,etc,etc.

My husband says he we can’t stop her babysitting because it will break her heart. And I’m like, but what about breaking our kid if she leaves the gate open again???

On Mother’s Day I didn’t have any plans to see my mom because she was supposed to go on a trip that she decided to not go on.

Once I saw the message I once again asked her to come over and she replied that I should be making the effort to come see her instead.

I replied that I just had thought she would want to come over to my place because she usually likes to come here because we have air conditioning. (And she can see my cat)

I didn’t say anything else afterword because it appeared she didn’t want to see me because her message seemed passive aggressive and demanding.

She then said sarcastically “thanks for the effort I will remember this”

I’m confused because I had asked three times to see her but somehow I kept getting aggressive responses, she didn’t even tell me when she was available, to be fair I didn’t really want to ask.

I had bought flowers for her living room but I might just keep them because I don’t really like her tone, but maybe I’m in the wrong and I should have just told her I’m coming over? She lives in an apartment so I can’t just invite myself over to see if she’s home.

24,1crghut,AITA for not inviting someone I don't like to my post-prom plans?,"Hey everyone. 18F here, and I am a current high school senior (so yes, this will be very high school drama-esque). In my area, it's common that, after senior prom, people will go away without parental supervision for the first time for the rest of the weekend.

Earlier this year, I was talking with my cousin and we brainstormed to go to a very similar place in another state as the place most people go tends to be packed and VERY dingy/unsafe because of the type of people such an event attracts. This was a perfect solution, because while I wanted the experience of going somewhere, I'm definitely not the party type and would rather spend the weekend hanging out with friends and relaxing. A few months ago, I ran this idea by my best friend, M (17F). They were really excited by this idea, and the two of us started to plan. We ended up with six people total, including us.

Where the problem comes in is that my friend, M, is also friends with another person, V (17F). V is a very headstrong person that tends to be obnoxious and bossy. She's not a bad person by any means, but is someone that I personally can only handle in small doses. She also tends to take over other peoples' plans, such as taking it upon herself to decide the guest list and everything else for a party she wasn't even hosting, excluding myself and others from the list. She has also borderline bullied me over small things and using her loud voice/bigger figure in a way that would pressure me not to respond or to agree. She has also specifically implied to other people that she does not like me.

I didn't want V to come, because not only do I dislike her, but I fear that she will 'take over' our plans, and make our trip into something it's not. Also, she tends to be a very anxious person, and I do not want her anxiety to be my problem. V tends to be very self-centered, and will bring things that are not about her to make them so that they are. Also, with the obnoxiousness, if I am hypothetically consuming things that wouldn't be particularly allowed, she would only draw attention to our group.

Anyway, the trip. M had half a mind to invite V, but I insisted for reasons above that it was a bad idea, and that V had mentioned she already had plans. This wasn't a total lie, because M did suggest that V was going to go to someone else's house that weekend. After a while, it was apparent that M did feel guilty about not inviting her. I urged her to throw me under the bus and that we were both under the impression that she had other plans, as flaky as they did seem. M did insist on telling V about the trip, which I understood, because she didn't want V to find out over social media and think that M had gone behind her back. Apparently, V didn't respond well, and according to M, she did throw me under the bus as I'd urged her to.

I've been struggling because while I feel O.K. for not inviting V (this trip was my idea, after all), I do feel like a bad friend to M for putting her in the middle.

27,1crfs7l,AITA for expecting my brother to share his inheritance? ,"I (20F) have an adopted brother (29M), my parents always wanted kids but they struggled to conceive and at some point they just gave up and decided to adopt. Few years later, they had me. We lived a very comfortable life as our parents are relatively well off.

All was fine and dandy until my brother went off to college started asking questions about his biological family. This created a huge rift between him and my parents, they didn’t want to give up any informations but he was insistent, they fought constantly and eventually they gave him an ultimatum of **either he gives up on finding his bio parents or they will write him off the will.**

They fought and eventually he decided that he wants to find them above all else and they gave him his bio mom’s contact and he went NC with them ever since. I heard from him periodically and he would talk about his bio mom and their relationship while my resentment grew. 

This was a terrible time for me, I was sad kid and mad at both my parents and my brother. I couldn’t comprehend why my brother preferred meeting a woman that willingly gave him up over keeping the peace in our household. I also resented my parents for making such a stupid ultimatum and breaking our family apart. 

Anyways, my father passed away and true to his word, my brother was not in the will. My brother despite going no contact all those years came to the funeral and patched things up with mom.

Later, My brother asked me to split my inheritance with him because even if my dad hasn’t regarded him as a son the past few years I should still regard him as a brother and share the inheritance. 

I had planned to use the inheritance to finish up my degree debt free, but I just got my family back together and didn’t want to create strife again, i figured it’s a small price to pay to have the family reunited again. 

For a while it was all good within the family and we were happy, until recently my brother’s bio mom passed away and she left everything to my brother, she wasn’t rich by any means but she did leave a substantial amount of money. 

When I heard this news I approached my brother and suggested he splits his inheritance with me as well, as I was struggling financially to put myself through school while his was paid fully by dad+ he got half the inheritance meant for me. 

My brother got very mad at this suggestion and told me I have no ties to his bio mother therefore no claim to her money and I’m being greedy and entitled. We fought about this and mom who was on his side completely and she told me that we share her and dad but his bio parents are his alone therefore I can’t demand he splits his inheritance with me. 

On one hand i understand I’m not entitled to his money on the other I feel like he got an unfair advantage and should be willing to help me out.

So i (16F), have a friend L (16F) that has been recently really rude and kinda cruel to all of our friend group, especially when talking about a school work we are doing (a short film).

Little context: our teacher passed this short film 2 months ago, and we haven't been able to do it yet because everyone is busy or cancels at the last minute.  We only had a date that was more than a month away when we marked that we would record the whole day and finish that, but her bf forgot to tell his parents and one day before told us that he wouldnt be able to go, so we have to cancel, and now we dont have any other days

Because of that, we maybe criated other group without she and her bf to talk about this situation, bc we were all really angry and sad about that, and bc she doesnt let us talk anything just a little bad about him, always defeding this boy like he never do anything bad

Ofc she discovered the groupchat and was (and i think still is) very mad about that, she screamed at us and all, we ask for forgiveness and all, a really shit weekend. But on monday she was ""back to normal"" with me and other friend (we are a group of ten), but was ignoring or being rude to the rest and the couple and others 2 (that werent on the group) kind of distanced themselves from us, okay, good, do what u want

But in the last week she is being really rude to everyone for a lot of Silly reasons (i asked if i could borrow a pencil and she blow up on me saying i was stealing her, for example), and i mean, i now we did a shit think and we are doing everything we can to make she happy, but she just ignores and treat everyone bad

I freaked out this morning, bc tomorrow we are going to record (if everything went smoothly) The rest of the scenes, and she pushed me and say like ""if we cant record tomorrow we (she, bf and friend) arent going to lose other day to do this"" i was ""what? We dont have another day"", and she started ranting that she already lost a lot of robotic and finances class (its a lie, if she did loss those class isnt about this school work, its personal stuff, we always make sure we didnt record on her classes days, the first time is tomorrow), that we (the rest of the group) have to start to do something (we are doing everything, especially me, i did the script, i am the director, she is just the a três that never studies her frases ) to help and bla bla, even blaming me for not reminding her boyfriend every day about the recording like im his mother, and i kinda said that the one useless on this was her, that the other four actors also lost a lot of classes, that she isnt the shiny gold good girl like she is acting she is, and to start being a little more responsible with this work bc its our only grade on the 3⁰ bimester

When it came to the end of ceremony I’ve asked one of them to be the witness and sign off on the paper. Didn’t give it much thought at the time as it just a peace of paper. But then after all was done, I heard a slightly unpleasant remark from the other friend that he is disappointed. Thought it was a joke and I just let it go. 

For the rest of the wedding that friend didn’t engage in any conversations with me and I could feel something is wrong. But since it was my wedding I decided to not think too much and enjoy the day. He also left pretty early which is unlike him as he usually stays till the end. 

Comes next day and I see he removed me from his “friends” on social media and ignores my messages. 

I’m like 100% sure that this is because of the paper thing. But it’s just surprised me that a 30 yo guy would get cheesed over a signature on the paper. 

Not sure if it’s my fault here, and what to do now. He is my best friend after all and I don’t want to lose him over something small like this.

For some back ground…we hosted a small ceremony of about 15 people. Had two of my best friends attend who I knew for about 5 years. One guy is 28 and the other 30. I’ve asked both of them to be my best man at the wedding because i value them both.

32,1crf9n8,AITA for buying something that I knew someone else really wanted?,"I just moved to a new state for an internship and I’m trying to furnish my room. As a young college student (19F) I don’t really have an excess of money to spend so I went to a discount store nearby in search of furniture. Upon walking in my eyes were immediately drawn to this bright orange desk chair in great condition for only $10! I quickly fell in love so I grabbed the chair and pushed it around with me as I looked for other things. 

At one point an employee pulled me aside and told me to “keep an eye on the chair cause someone might try and snag it.” I assumed she was joking so I laughed and moved on. I did make the mistake of leaving the chair unattended while looking at some of the extra discounted items, but when I returned I saw the same employee MOVING the chair! I ran up to confront her and she said she was “just moving it out of the way” (the chair was tucked in a corner, NOT IN THE WAY). I laughed it off and passive aggressively thanked her before making sure the chair was in my sight at ALL times. 

She watched me the rest of the time I was there and when I went to check out she was conveniently at the register right next to the one I was at. She was sharing with her coworker (at a volume just loud enough for me to hear) how she has been needing a chair just like the one I found and how she works a lot, has children, isn’t doing well financially, and how it’s so frustrating to “watch people who can probably afford new items come to the discount store and buy all the good things” (her words). I did start to feel bad a bit cause even though I’m not super wealthy like she assumed, I would be okay without the chair. I’ll admit that I do have a bean bag chair I brought from home that I could use as a place to sit while doing homework. I almost caved and gave the employee the chair until the lady checking me out informed me that she couldn’t sell me the chair because there was no barcode price sticker on it. 

That’s when I knew something was up cause the selling point of the chair for me was the fact that it was $10! How could I have known that if there was not a price on the chair?? So I looked around like a crazy person for the barcode sticker until the employee who previously tried to steal my chair \*magically\* found the sticker. When I tell you I was LIVID. I completed the purchase and marched out with my stuff without offering the employee a thank you for “finding my sticker”. 

Now that I’ve had time to sit back and reflect I do feel bad about how I behaved while leaving. Yes what she did wasn’t cool, but she was an older lady who probably does work a lot and is doing her best to provide for her family, and I’m a college student who’s only gonna be here for a half a year then I’ll probably have to sell the chair when I go home.

33,1crf9b8,AITA for not wanting to visit my fiances family?,"Ok,so my fiance and I are 5 months out from the wedding we'd always hoped for. We are very excited and have a very tight, for the most part healthy relationship. We communicate very well. 
I think our personalities compliment each other, being that I'm the introvert, organized, non risk taker and he's more the extrovert, a little messy, adventurous one. I keep him grounded and he has taught me how to loosen up. He has a 7 year old son, whom I've developed a very special relationship with. We are close and he comes to me when he tends to gravitate toward me. I love him very much. 

For the time being, we are living in a house with his mother to save money for the wedding and a down payment on our own place. The arrangement helps my soon to be MIL, being that she couldn't afford the place on her own. 
I thought I'd develop a close relationship with his family. I don't have a lot of family and I'm grieving the loss of my oldest son, so I really could have gotten used to the support of a family. 
The problem is, his family members one by one have made horrible comments about our relationship, especially his mother. Things like ""well he's just in love with being in love and I worry that he doesn't actually love you."" And, ""he's just obsessed with you until the next thing catches his eye."" 
They all comment about him spending more time with me and his son and less time with them as well. He used to visit his grandmother every week/every other week and fix things in her house. I think that's sweet but what his family would use him for wasn't limited to him doing little things for Grandma around the house. 
It seems they are more upset that he's not doing for them anymore. He's a grown man of 33! Did they not think he'd find someone? 
It's like they're all surprised he's not entirely about them anymore and that's just bizarre to me. 
After hearing this narrative about how it MUST be ME because the changes coincided with us getting together, I decided I would no longer subject myself to their B.S. 
They don't care about our engagement and only his grandma has even asked to see my ring. No one talks about or asks about our wedding planning, yet they see things being delivered and hear us talking about plans, vendors, decor, etc. 
I told him I just don't want to go to his extended family's homes anymore. I still have to endure living with his mother for now, who obviously feels some type of way about her grown man son being grown. I'm exhausted.

My aunt (cousins mom) is paying for the wedding. 

Yesterday at a family gathering for Mother’s Day, my aunt says to me “no funny business at the wedding”

Confused, I asked her to elaborate. She said “none of that gay stuff. No makeup, no nail polish, no fruity outfits, no girly hairstyles… and for god sake grow some hair on your legs. You’re a man and you WILL act like one”

For reference, I’m gender fluid and gender non conforming. I have long (mid back) hair and a short well kept beard. I shave my body hair (except the beard). I don’t wear makeup everyday but I usually have my nails done and my clothing is a mix of both “masculine” and “feminine” attire. 

I’m happy with myself and the way I present myself and have been for many years. This is nothing new, and I’ve never been given grief over it before by any family or friends, including her.  

And, for what it’s worth, the outfit I have picked out for the wedding (which she already saw) is a tux for the ceremony and male dressy beach clothes for the after party. 

Offended, I, “first off, this is not YOUR wedding, second, if this is such a big deal, why was I even invited??” 

She said “I just don’t want to be embarrassed and have the photos ruined”

To which I said, “well I won’t ruin anything because I’m not going” 

She got mad and said I had to because the seating and catering is already set and if I don’t go it will mess it up.

39,1cremzw,WIBTA if I asked my elderly disabled mom to move out,"I currently live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with my fiancé and mom, and 3 cats. My fiancé and I have lived here for approximately 3 years, and we lived together in another apartment before that. 

My mom was renting an apartment with my sister for a few years. Last year my sister moves out to move in with her long term boyfriend. When this happened my fiancé and I allowed my mom to move in with us since she couldn’t afford the rent at her apartment by herself. We never had a set agreed upon date to have her stay with us until because she is on a waitlist for subsidized housing. Well 10 months later and she is still on the waitlist. I recently called to see the status of her on there and she is number 27. She has been on this waitlist since at least November 2022.

My fiancé and I no longer want her here. The room she occupies used to be my game room and I’d like to have it back. We also used to have semi frequent gatherings amongst our friends where we stay up late, party, and some times have intoxicated friends stay over. We no longer do these things to be considerate to her and not to wake her at night. We also don’t have much more space to sleep others with the room she occupies. My mom is mostly independent, however sometimes she gets out of breath and is unable to fetch herself a beverage and will ask me or my fiancé to do this. Sometimes she orders from DoorDash and says she can’t bend down to get her food and asks us to get the door. This isn’t all the time and is more on an adhoc basis dependent on her breathing and how her asthma affecting her at that moment in time. While these things are extremely minor and trivial I’m starting to find them annoying, though I do them without complaint. 


Important note: My aunt (mom’s sister) picks her up once a week and takes her to her house to do her laundry, give her a shower, and they usually do a little shopping.

Because of the payments being made to my aunt I feel like she should have offered my mom a place to stay when we learned my mom was unable to afford to stay in her old apartment. My mom says the reason my aunt and uncle didn’t offer a room in their house is because my mom stayed with them in the past when she was having health issues and was burdensome, and my uncle didn’t want to deal with her again.


I feel bad at the thought of asking her to leave because she has always been an amazing mother and I love her, however my fiancé and I never get privacy anymore and it has caused more than one fight between us. I feel as if I kicked my mom out one of her two siblings would offer her a room as a last resort, however as if then I’m “forcing them”


My fiancé and I want her gone by the time we get married. Would I be the asshole for asking her to leave by October?",Asshole,2024-05-14,"WIBTA if I asked my elderly disabled mom to move out I currently live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with my fiancé and mom, and 3 cats. My fiancé and I have lived here for approximately 3 years, and we lived together in another apartment before that. 

My mom was renting an apartment with my sister for a few years. Last year my sister moves out to move in with her long term boyfriend. When this happened my fiancé and I allowed my mom to move in with us since she couldn’t afford the rent at her apartment by herself. We never had a set agreed upon date to have her stay with us until because she is on a waitlist for subsidized housing. Well 10 months later and she is still on the waitlist. I recently called to see the status of her on there and she is number 27. She has been on this waitlist since at least November 2022.

My fiancé and I no longer want her here. The room she occupies used to be my game room and I’d like to have it back. We also used to have semi frequent gatherings amongst our friends where we stay up late, party, and some times have intoxicated friends stay over. We no longer do these things to be considerate to her and not to wake her at night. We also don’t have much more space to sleep others with the room she occupies. My mom is mostly independent, however sometimes she gets out of breath and is unable to fetch herself a beverage and will ask me or my fiancé to do this. Sometimes she orders from DoorDash and says she can’t bend down to get her food and asks us to get the door. This isn’t all the time and is more on an adhoc basis dependent on her breathing and how her asthma affecting her at that moment in time. While these things are extremely minor and trivial I’m starting to find them annoying, though I do them without complaint.

winter break happens then spring break is around the corner and weve always had talks of going on a senior trip. one might argue that the senior trip was the abroad trip but not everyone was invited and not everyone did go. so i bring up the idea of going to a city for a few days. i invite everyone. some people drop bc of monetary reasons and some are unavailable. one specific person we will name A, says that they will only go if one of the guys from the dorm go. This was insulting bc if we are friends why does another guy specifically from his dorm have to go? the only guy from the dorm who was still potentially able to go was F.

In the email, I informed them that I had studied the behavior of a specific object of interest and developed a report based on it, using a database that had already been created by the team.

44,1creffo,AITA For Putting My Brother Out,"


Im 22(f) with a small child(5) I moved out of my parents home a year ago and my brother (21) moved in with me a short time after I got my apartment under the agreement that he would watch my child while I work. There is not written or any kind of physical evidence for this agreement that said my brother in the beginning had done very well with being there and watching my child however lately that isn’t the case. He’s often late returning home which in turn makes me late for work.
 
Just recently when this occurred again I had taken steps to try and Insure him being on time I texted him hours before my shift and even called almost an hour before my shift to ask if he’d be home on time to which he said yes. He shows up 2 minutes before I have to be at my job clocking in. Instead of apologizing for being late he asks why didn’t I just leave. Mind you he is there to watch my child while I work and I work overnight. 

  I talked to him about it and he says he doesn’t know what time he should be here and that I need to tell him what on time is even tho he’s lived with me for a year and I’ve worked the exact same job and hours since he’s been here and he knows what time I have to be at work. During the discussion he said that since I was the one with the car I should drop my son off with him wherever he is at. To which I responded with since you don’t have a car then you should have already been here. He then tells me that I’m trying to shackle him to my child and how I don’t even work that much. (I only work about 2days out of the week always overnights) He said that he had rushed to get here and said rushing took 46 minutes even though he was not even 24minutes away from home to begin with and how he had to wait on our best friend to get ready so they could bring him back home. He made no attempt to call and say that he’d be late and when I brought that up he said well you have my location.

Just last night upon my arrival to work he sent me a text saying “just to be late” which I can only assume was referring to the time I arrived at my job which in fact was properly on time. I told him that me letting him stay the rest of the month with me was also out me being kind and that I again wasn’t shackling him to anything and the he could leave expeditiously.

Furthermore when first moving into my apartment I made one rule and that rule was no getting spicy while my son is home a rule which he has broken multiple times with different women and causing my son to ask me some very uncomfortable questions and make very unsettling statements.

Sorry for any errors I am both on a phone and typing quickly. Ps, I already know I’m the asshole I just need help rectifying my mistake before my life becomes a living hell.

I have a roommate. We were placed together randomly and right off the bat, we didn’t exactly click. She did things I didn’t agree with and I found it hard to bring it up. In conjunction, I did the same and we didn’t get along. After having a roommate meeting with our RA that in short did not go well, we kind of went on to not speaking to each other. It doesn’t bother me much but I try to be as kind as possible. I’ll take out her trash when she’s visibly stressed, give her care packages, bring her gifts from work, etc. Still, she doesn’t seem to want to have anything to do with me. It hurts a bit but regardless, I’m fine with it. 

Anyways, I have an anemia. I get really really cold and my roommate loves her fan. Today, when I was alone in my room, about 20 minutes before class I decided to turn up the heater so I could warm up. I had full intentions of turning it off but I completely forgot and left. 

In class, I get an angry text from my roommate expressing her displeasure in the room being so hot and me not being in it. I feel so incredibly bad because I truly didn’t mean to leave it. I apologized and assured her it wouldn’t happen again because again, I don’t want to upset her. 

My question now is what do I do? She has told me in the past how she doesn’t like the heater on and so I have simply stopped using it altogether despite how cold I get. She tends to retaliate by disrupting my sleep and treating the room as her own and as my school begins to get closer to finals, I really need to be able to sleep. I don’t know how I should rectify the situation because I really do feel bad and it was an honest mistake but I’m scared my migraines and loss of appetite will return if I’m not able to make the situation right.

48,1cs68t6,AITA for having a Birthday the same week as my SIL’s father,"I (16) am turning (17) tomorrow, on the Wed 15 May. My (27) Sister-In-Law (my older brother’s Baby's Mother/ Fiancée) has her father’s birthday coming up on Friday 17 May. 

I suggested to my brother (now 32) on the night of Tue 14 May that: I, my brother and older sister should go out for a meal. I told him and he approved by the following afternoon but asked me to check up on my sister.

My sister approved so I ran it back to my brother and he was going to book the reservation. Later on, my sister asked where we were going and I said “Location X” and she snarked; “If he’s allowed to go”. This was a shock since my brother approved and I was excited. That’s when my mother told me that my brother and his missus disagreed. 

What happened was my brother promised his missus that he would drive her up to her Dad’s birthday in City X on Friday 17, but wanted to leave on Wednesday 15, I don’t know how it got misconstrued when my brother’s birthday is on Mon 13 May and he well knew, including my S-I-L.

SIL lives with us in City Y, approx. 4 hours drive from City X. Obviously she’s homesick but her father’s is on Friday and most likely is not doing anything from today until then and she could take the coach or train. Plus she could always leave tomorrow as my brother proposed.

Now my brother feels bad for me, they had a row and are on the verge of breaking up (over-controlling from both parties). 

It’s not about the meal in my brother’s eyes, it's about that he’s not able to spend it with me.

I feel awful as I have a really bad response to disappointment, abandonment and empty promises caused by trauma from my father. It's contributing to the argument.

I had no intention of making a big deal about it and had not even planned on attending my graduation ceremony, so telling people about it wasn’t on my radar. But then last week, I realized graduation was actually the same day as my fiancé’s (32M) cousin’s (30M) wedding out of state that we had already made plans to attend. My fiancé’s sister (29F) made a joke in the family group chat about me not realizing the wedding and the graduation were the same day and said we should do a mock poolside graduation at the resort. His mom (59F) said she’d bring a cap and gown. The groom thought it was hilarious and wanted to “preside over the graduation and make a speech”.

So the pretend graduation happened this past Saturday, we snapped some photos by the pool, and everyone had a good laugh. I posted the pictures on Facebook and said thank you to my fiancé’s family for doing this for me. 

But then today, I get a passive aggressive text from my mom (65F) asking why I didn’t tell her about the graduation. For the record, my mother does not live in my state, nor the state the wedding was in, and was actually traveling somewhere else with her sister this past weekend. I told her I didn’t think it was a big deal and I hadn’t even planned on going to my real graduation anyway. She said apparently it WAS a big deal since I brought a cap and gown and thanked my fiancé’s family on Facebook for it. I told her I didn’t plan this and sent her screen shots from my the family chat to prove it was nothing more than a last minute joke.

50,1cs67y2,WIBTA if I don't commit to dog-sit for my girlfriend and her parents while they go on vacation? ,"I'll try to make this quick!

Basically, I have been dating my girlfriend for 7 months. I have met her parents on numerous occasions, including family holidays and even helped her move alongside them recently. 

The family will be going on a week-long trip in late June (I wasn't invited along, which I understand as it is a family trip). Her parents asked me to dog-sit while they are away as they have an older dog that needs the supervision, and I suppose that dog resorts and sitters are too expensive - therefore they asked me. The problem, however, is that I live 40 minutes away from their home, so I would have to live in their house with nothing to do (maybe bring my gaming computer?) while they go on vacation. During this time, I do have nothing to do (I graduated from college and will start my job after they return from vacation). So it's not that I don't have the time/ability to do this, it's just inconvenient. That being said, I might take a different trip with a parent at some point during that week, but I'm not 100% sure that that trip will happen and haven't locked down any dates. 

I told my girlfriend and her mom that I don't want to do that because of the vacation and because I would have to stay at that house for an entire week - away from my own bed, gym, and other comforts of home. I simply don't want to have to do that. 

I also said that they should explore alternatives and if they really can't find someone who lives closer to dogsit, or send the dog to a resort then I'll dogsit. I just don't want to be the first option. 

My girlfriend texted me that, because I'm on the fence, and because they ""simply don't have any other alternatives"", they will likely be cancelling the trip. I told her that they shouldn't do that, and that I'll do it if need be. I'm also confused as to why neighbors or other alternatives can't be explored in the meantime (her uncle who lives around 20 min away has done it in the past, but now has a wife and 2 dogs of his own, so they are hesitant to ask him to do it. I get that they need to book flights and accommodations now, and therefore need to know what happens with the dog to go on the trip, but I am confused as to how the whole thing hinges on me. 

WIBTA if I didn't commit to dogsitting for them while they're on vacation? I feel as though they are angry and resent me for this right now, but I have made it clear that I will dogsit if it means the difference between going and not going, I just don't want to be the first option.

We spent our vacation time the last two years visiting her grandparents who live across the country. Recently her grandparents (85), moved out of their house and into retirement living and no longer had space for both of their vehicles. Her grandpa decided to gift my BIL a truck with a fair value of $50,000. His justification was to ""help him build confidence"" and ""give him something to care for.""

We have a trip planned to visit them in a few months, but I have no interest in going to see them.

I come outside and we have about 5 new plants, grill spatula (I guess a normal spatula wouldn’t do), some fairy lights and he’s about to order a £30 grill and £12 grill cover. Now I’ve been a little more frugal lately due to my spending habits and being out of a job, but he’s said in the group chat that we should split it equal five ways, £16 each. 

I personally think, i’ve not spent £16 on that garden and none of the other flatmates have really. The lights are nice, the plants are too but we don’t even have a table, and we could easily do with a metal tray, charcoal in it and griddles on top right? I just think if we split a “nice” grill 5 ways who’s going to keep it? or do we leave it for next years tenants? either way I feel like that’s money not well spent, or maybe I should just live a little?",0.0,1.0357273817062378,1,0
56,1cs5tco,AITA for asking my husband to pick up dinner but refusing to call in the order?,"
I (45F) was suppose to have same day surgery on Friday.  I usually recover quickly from surgeries, example: I was able to go back to work although uncomfortably four days after a c-section.  I say was supposed to have same day surgery because it turned into a six hour surgery during which I vomited while under anesthesia.  After I was extremely dizzy and feeling nauseated so I had to stay one night at the hospital.  It’s been three days and I still feel awful, not so much the pain but the nausea and dizziness.

Yesterday, my partner (47M) asked me what we were doing for dinner.  I told him I didn’t have an appetite but needed to eat so would eat whatever.  He asked me again to decide and I said, fine just get a lasagna for us to share.  He said, from where.  I said from, Burkes, a restaurant 3 minutes from the house.  He asked if I could get somewhere with better parking.  At this point I’m getting annoyed cause I just want to get off the phone and lay my head down silently.  He then wants me to call in the order.  I just told him to forget it and just get himself dinner because this was becoming too much effort.  He responded with okay but I don’t see what the issue is, you are just lying around.  I had cereal for dinner.

Around a month or two ago I had an urge to write a multi-chapter story for the first time. I am by no means a good writer but I was proud of the chapter I did. My best friend (of almost 10 years) agreed to peer review it. But when I sent the chapter to her, she said ""Bro I'll be honest I'm not reading all that, you sent me like an essay"". I accepted that but was disappointed. Fast forward two months she said she wrote a chapter and was proud of it for her story. She asked me to read it. 

I happily would have read it if she read my chapter back then. I told her my reason and she is saying that it's a big difference and that her chapter that she sent is half the length of what I wrote for a chapter.

58,1cs5fbm,AITA for arguing with my husband for disturbing my rest while he takes care of our baby?,"This goes back to Mother’s Day when we argued about me feeling unappreciated. He offered to handle the morning feeding for a week to make it up.

We decided he would come help with the baby at 9:30 am, allowing me to nap. He texted me at 9:35 saying he needed 15 more minutes, and I said sure. He showed up at 10 am and took care of the baby. I went back to bed immediately, but it takes me nearly an hour to fall asleep as I’m a light sleeper.

At around 10:50, he told me he had to go poop and needed to leave at 11 am. I told him, with my eyes closed, that I hadn’t fallen asleep yet but was very close. Instead of putting the baby in her crib in the nursery, he left her in the bassinet next to my bed. Baby started crying and screaming, and I exploded, saying, “Babe, I’m so close to falling asleep.”

I told him he could have put the baby in the nursery while he pooped. He argued he didn’t know it takes me a long time to fall asleep, despite me telling him.

After he left, I texted him, explaining:

I was upset that after I told him I didn’t get the rest I needed, he still chose to put the baby next to me. I admitted that I shouldn’t have escalated my anger so quickly. I felt I was considerate enough to let him sleep longer in the morning before his turn. Despite knowing he had to leave at 11 and that it takes me a long time to fall asleep, he still disturbed my rest and came help late. This kind of disturbance was very uncomfortable and even painful for me.

He argued that if I were disciplined enough to sleep soon after baby went to bed, he wouldn’t have to help me. He said he was paying for my lack of discipline. He said that if he hadn’t offered to help, I wouldn’t have been mad at him to begin with.

I agreed that shouting was not the right way to express my discontent. I’m grateful for his intention to help, but I don’t think that means I should not be displeased for whatever help is offered, regardless of how it affects me. 

He said that I think the world revolves around me and I shouldn’t even be mad at someone who is helping me out.

59,1cs5ccs,AITA for wanting free flowers? ,"So when you spend $300 at our grocer you get a free thing. We love the free thing and it’s always exciting or a let down, but it’s a thing. This past Monday, the day after Mother’s Day, it was a jumbo hanging planter of flowers. 

But my partner declined it. He just said no. He didn’t want it. We have never declined the free thing. So when he gets home and tells me this, I get sad. I used to have a flower farm and was a garden writer. This is the first year in fifteen years I don’t have a garden because we are moving in a few months. 

I said I was sad. He replies “jeez sorry”. But it’s sorta sarcastic? Rude sounding. But I was going to drop it.  Then he says, “Actually I am not. I’m not sorry at all. I didn’t want it.”

I start to cry. I leave the room. I cry before bed tucking in the kids, I cried when I woke up. I have been with him four years and I have told him many times I’d love flowers sometime, but never once have gotten any. Not even free ones now?

I tell him the next day, explain it hurt and why. 

He unloads on me. Says it was stressful to grocery shop. He was tired and our toddler was causing havoc and the house sale is stressful and he has more on his mind. I say thanks for explaining, I understand. 

He adds that I’m criminalizing him by adding this to his plate, I have made him feel not good enough. I say sorry and reassure him he is appreciated and awesome and thank him for all he does.

He adds that I am likely mentally ill and I invented this and demands I “take ownership of my behaviour”. I say I own that it hurt me and I own I came to you with that hurt expecting an apology. 

He says he will never apologize and I am being an AH, making it all up to create problems and keeps saying I refuse to “take ownership” and I should hear it from a third party. 

I snap. I tell him that my hurt shouldn’t end in thanking him for everything he does for the family, and that he is TA, and a gaslighter, I’m done, cancel the house sale, I blocked him and I think I mean it. 

I could be TA because I couldn’t let it go. It’s just a stupid basket of flowers at the end of the day, and I got socks and a nice hat for Mother’s Day and I should be more grateful, right?

Mother's day has always been a point of contention. I really wish he would do something nice for me but he always tells me ""you aren't my mom,"" and does nothing noteworthy. It's gotten worse over the years and came to a boiling point two days ago (mother's day) 
I had reminded everyone that mother's day was coming up but on the day everyone except our 20 and 18 year olds forgot. 20m works all day he came over late in the evening, and 18 said happy mother's Day in the morning before he left for work.  I can't really fault the other  kids for it as many of them are young. By noon I was almost in tears. 

When my husband came out of his man cave and told me he wanted me to cook steak for lunch I almost broke down crying. I cook almost every day for everyone and I really just did not want to cook on mothers day. 

I left the house, went for a walk and bought myself a pizza. When I came home I put his steak in the air fryer. Which was apparently wrong and he got mad about it. 
As he was scolding me over cooking the steak wrong I started crying and said ""it's mother's day!! "" And his response was.... 
He yelled at me for wanting to be the center of attention and told me ""you aren't my mother! You did not give birth to me!"" 

He spent the rest of the day angry at me. He refused to eat the rest of the day. He said he wanted steak to be something nice we did together and I said I didn't want to have to cook because it was mother's day and I wanted him to do something for me but he didn't want to so I went for pizza alone. 

Around dinner time he made a steak and I thought it was for him as I had already eaten but he put it in front of me and told me I better enjoy it. I ate about half it was a huge steak the size of the plate.

I tried to talk to him later he got angry and stormed out. The next day he was still angry. I told him he really hurt my feelings and he said ""you say every other day that I'm hurting your feelings. You always take things wrong, so I guess I just won't talk at all that way you can't take anything wrong."" 

He wants me to act happy so I've been trying to but now it's been two days and he's still angry with me. He keeps sitting on the couch arms crossed refusing to speak or anything. 

Maybe I should have just cooked the steak and not gone out? Am I being unreasonable, after all I'm not his mom. It's just that, as the mother of his children it would be nice to be celebrated on mothers day for once.

61,1cs4urs,AITA for taking neighbour's cat,"*UPDATE* Neighbour's 17-year-old has threatened to kidnap my 1-year-old. WIBTAH if I contacted police?

I (35F) was on my street and saw a girl (about 8) deliberately drop a kitten from shoulder height to the ground. The kitten had to brace itself to land safely. A man (I presumed dad) was watching and made no comment. I approached the kitten and noticed it was a bit thin. Instinct got the better of me and I took the kitten in. I posted on a local fb group about what I saw and asked if anyone knew the owner. Got the cat some food which it ate like it was famished. Didn't see anything on fb until the next morning when I found a flurry of messages. 

First a female I'll call Milly, called and told me the whole story. The kitten was born under her bed. She moved out because of a breakdown in her relationship with her mum. She was sad to leave the cats, said there were about 9 in the home and 2 dogs, none of the animals were cared for properly and she asked me to keep the cat called Buddy. She said if I gave him back he'd disappear like the others eventually do.

Second female, I'll call her Annie. Messaged and begged me to return Buddy, confirmed she is Milly's sister. Agreed her younger sister was the one i saw with her step-dad and agreed her siblings needed to treat Buddy better. I offered to care for him and money to buy him but she insisted she was very attached to Buddy and would take better care of him, she also estimated 9 cats in their property and one likely pregnant.

While talking to Annie, her stepdad (we'll call him Gary) chimed in on the post I made on Facebook saying his younger daughter was just trying to ""stop the cat following them"" and she was crying all night because she was worried about her cat and I shouldn't have taken him and he's well fed. 

I took the kitten to the vet who confirmed no microchip, his weight was OK but he had signs of worms so i got dewormer. Told Annie I'd return Buddy once he'd has his worming treatment and suggested chipping and neutering all the cats which she agreed she would look into. 

Annie and I agreed a meet up point at which time step dad started sending angry messages from his workplace because I wasn't returning the cat yet and I was communicating with a child instead of him. Turns out Annie is 13! But WAY more mature than stepdad. He became threatening and I was home alone with a poorly toddler so I went to meet Annie. Sweet kid, took my advice on board and asked questions. 

Told Gary cat was home, that from 10th June if Buddy isn't chipped someone can legally take him and claim him. I told him why I took Buddy and that if I'm concerned about an animal I'll check for a chip and act accordingly. I also told him Annie is a good kid and to neuter his cats! Then blocked him. Now Gary's teenage son is trying to intimidate me on my walk home.

62,1cs4ufj,AITA for calling a friend out over text,"My friend and I are college freshmen (both f19). Last semester, my friend Ashley and I were close, but this semester, it feels like she ghosted me for another friend, Riley.



I was upset by this, but I didn't feel like I should say anything because Ashley was going to hang out with who she wanted, and if that's not me, then whatever. She also seemed distant and could get rude at times, but I justified that it was her depression and the stress she was going through with her classes.



A couple of days ago, Ashley, Riley, and I went to get stuff for another friend's birthday party. Ashley and Riley talked the entire way there, and I didn't really say much. At this point, I was used to it. I'm a quiet person, and they talk so much and so quickly that I don't get the chance to add to the conversation. 



After getting what we needed, Riley headed off to study, so Ashley and I walked over to the dorms together. I tried to talk with her, but again, she was distant and didn't give me a whole lot of responses that would continue the conversation, so we were quiet. Then, all of a sudden, Ashley walks ahead of me and puts on headphones, which I think I can fairly say is quite rude. It also made me wonder if the distancing was because of something I did.



I wanted to talk it over then, but we were all gonna be hanging out at this friend's party. I didn't wanna ruin the mood and punish my other friends for shit they're not a part of, so I didn't say anything. Ashley also moved out the next morning, so I didn't have an opportunity to talk it out with her because she was leaving when I woke up. I felt shitty for texting her about how the whole ditching me shit was rude, but I didn't exactly have a choice. I also asked if there was something I did.



Anyway, she texted back, saying that something I said had upset her very early in the semester. I remember regretting the thing I said, but I didn't know it was something that would affect her to the point of being closed off and rude. I apologized after learning how much it had upset her, but I also let her know that this was something that should have been communicated to me if it was upsetting enough to push me away. This is what I'm mainly upset about.



I also let it slip that when we were debating housing next year as a group, I was hurt by things said. Long story short, she said something that I really should have talked to her about, but I felt like the group was against me and I didn't wanna be pushed away even further. 



Now she's upset and ""shocked"" that I didn't communicate about this in person ""like adults"" and squarely put the blame on me, but I think both of us poorly communicated. It also feels like the text conversation is one-sided; I'm trying to own up to the things she's saying hurt her, but all I'm getting is more blame and more reasons I'm wrong.

AITA?",TL;DR,2024-05-14,"AITA for calling a friend out over text My friend and I are college freshmen (both f19). Last semester, my friend Ashley and I were close, but this semester, it feels like she ghosted me for another friend, Riley.



I was upset by this, but I didn't feel like I should say anything because Ashley was going to hang out with who she wanted, and if that's not me, then whatever. She also seemed distant and could get rude at times, but I justified that it was her depression and the stress she was going through with her classes.



A couple of days ago, Ashley, Riley, and I went to get stuff for another friend's birthday party. Ashley and Riley talked the entire way there, and I didn't really say much. At this point, I was used to it. I'm a quiet person, and they talk so much and so quickly that I don't get the chance to add to the conversation. 



After getting what we needed, Riley headed off to study, so Ashley and I walked over to the dorms together. I tried to talk with her, but again, she was distant and didn't give me a whole lot of responses that would continue the conversation, so we were quiet. Then, all of a sudden, Ashley walks ahead of me and puts on headphones, which I think I can fairly say is quite rude. It also made me wonder if the distancing was because of something I did.



I wanted to talk it over then, but we were all gonna be hanging out at this friend's party. I didn't wanna ruin the mood and punish my other friends for shit they're not a part of, so I didn't say anything. Ashley also moved out the next morning, so I didn't have an opportunity to talk it out with her because she was leaving when I woke up. I felt shitty for texting her about how the whole ditching me shit was rude, but I didn't exactly have a choice. I also asked if there was something I did.



Anyway, she texted back, saying that something I said had upset her very early in the semester. I remember regretting the thing I said, but I didn't know it was something that would affect her to the point of being closed off and rude. I apologized after learning how much it had upset her, but I also let her know that this was something that should have been communicated to me if it was upsetting enough to push me away. This is what I'm mainly upset about.

So I shall begin with saying this friend and me dated back in 2015, broke up, then got back together in October 2019. It didn't last and we broke up again in 2020. In 2020 I started dating another girl which lasted for two years and it sadly ending with my ex moving home to be with her family and wanting to end the person she was when she was in my area.

My friend and myself started talking again quite regularly (she initiated it all) and became friends, meeting up and such, but she would always suggest couply things , like dinner for two in a fancy restaurant, she also started flirting and always wanting to know what I was doing which made me suspicious she wanted to be more than friends. 

One day she noticed I didn't have her number saved in my phone, she demanded that I saved it and something ""memorable"" (said in a flirtatious way), I was still broken up with my ex leaving and really thought she was the one and my friend, even though she was trying, would never be ""her"", so I named her ""not her"" in the phone and thought nothing more about it. This caused a fair few arguments with my friend and I was even called an asshole, rude and a dick,  it also got back to my parents and I was called ""nasty"" and I should just date her!? 

So I am wondering was this an asshole thing to do or understandable to set boundaries in a subtle way?

64,1cs4rfe,AITA for ignoring my best friend after she didn’t invite me to her wedding? ,"
Hi! 

My [28F] best friend [30F] Katie and I met back in  college and we became quite close  and lived together at about 19/21

She doesn’t drive but when we got closer I started bringing her to work with me to cocktail waitress. I had to change the one I was working at because they denied her and we had to go to one an hour away but it was fine I loved being able to hang with her so often.

After that year she graduated, moved a state away ~ 2/3 hours drive. 

When Katie first moved she was pretty lonely so i would visit her frequently, sometimes every single week. I would go there for entire weekends, birthdays, holidays, sometimes to take her to work with me up there, etc.

For example things like she had a brief fling with someone who hurt her so I sent a gift and then visited the next few weekends. When her cat died I did the same with a gift and visited, i rented an Airbnb when her grandfather died  so she could grieve with me away from roommates, etc. 

She has come to visit me twice and sent a gift once. We of course still talked ~5 days a week if not daily and still do to this day.

2 summers ago she got engaged and for the proposal I was there among one other friend and the rest was 50+ people entirely family that’s how close we are. 

Since that summer I had a huge breakup of ~8 year relationship it was pretty rough  and ended up in psych ward. I then had surgery, separately spent almost a month in hospital and almost died . I also had a bad car accident, and she forgot my birthday. 

She didn’t send a card, visit or anything. She rejected my sisters wedding invite as well, even though I asked her to come since I was still sad about breakup. I finally confronted her at the end of the year saying how hurt I was and asking her to visit because I needed her after the awful year I had and she said she loves me but she’s busy,  thatI expect too much and she sent some flowers.

For her wedding, I was gonna be MOH until they decided  family only due to how large their families are. (65+ people) I was hurt but alright not my wedding.

Saturday I visited for a bachelorette, me and her siblings split the bill it was great. 

Sunday Katie texted me saying thanks for coming and among other stuff I said I was happy to be invited despite no friends being able to be  at the wedding. 

Then, Katie tells me over text how people dropped out of the wedding so she invited another friend + her husband and then two of the grooms friends. Not me. I have yet to answer her text about that and she’s texted me twice since about random filler nonsense. 

I feel like I have put in so much effort and gotten minimal in return. So AITA if I keep ignoring her? AIO? Is this normal and I’m expecting too much? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-14,"AITA for ignoring my best friend after she didn’t invite me to her wedding?

EDIT: I‘ve been told I should edit this into my post: I dressed up for the wedding, I had my dress approved by the bride beforehand, but I wore makeup & did my hair & generally looked much nicer than usual. The bride is very upset that family (which included her now husband) commented that I looked nice, and that seems to be the root of the problem. More info in comments 

I (25F) and my partner Alex (24M) went to his brother Luke’s (30M) wedding this past weekend, and I left early which has caused a lot of drama with his family.

I have been dating Alex for 3 years and we’ve been living together for 2. I think I’m pretty close with his family; I go to every holiday, we visit his parents very often, his mum often takes me out for lunch & we run errands together, I talk to Luke & their sister both almost every day, we house/dog sit for Luke & Tanya (30F, Luke’s now wife) often, etc. I talk to Tanya all the time, we go out for coffee dates, etc. We were pretty close, I think!

Anyway, the wedding. I’m Alex’s plus one, he’s a groomsman. I am not invited to the ceremony, but that’s alright, I figure there’s limited space. I arrive to the reception and the plan was that I was sitting with Alex & Luke’s & also Tanya’s parents, since I know them both well. Change of plans last minute, I’m actually moved to a table in the corner with the DJ & whichever cooks & servers were taking their break at that time. I will admit I was hurt and feeling anxious since the reception was huge & I wasn’t around anyone I knew (I am pretty socially anxious in crowds & with strangers),  but I sucked it up & made small talk & was pleasant in general, because it’s not MY day.

After dinner, parents’ table was only about 3/4 full because some couldn’t make it, so they invite me over. I go to sit with them, but Tanya pulled me aside and said I can’t sit at the family table because photographers will be taking photos. Alex tries to come dance with me but Tanya tells him that he should stay at the wedding party table so that it isn’t empty for photos. Luke, the groom, eventually asks if I wanna dance with him since I’ve been sitting alone & he considers me his bonus little sister & he wants a dance with all of his family members at his wedding, but Tanya rushed in after about 30 seconds of dancing and pulled him away for something important.

I was getting the hint at this point, it was pretty clear I wasn’t very welcome here, but I still don’t know why. I caught Alex quick to say I wasn’t feeling well and I’d see him at home, I made my goodbyes, congratulated Luke and Tanya for their wedding, and ducked out.

Well… Alex is pissed at Tanya, because I told him everything after a cooling down period. Tanya is pissed at me for leaving early. Parents seem to be mad at me for “refusing to socialize;” I haven’t told them anything. Luke apologized to me but is otherwise staying out of it.

69,1cs47or,AITA for deleting old messages and lying to my GF when she asked about It?,"My (30M) girlfriend (33F) of 6 months asked me a question before going to bed: ""My friends who just divorced had a huge fight because the husband snooped through her phone and found out she was having an affair. What do you think of this?""

I answered that I believe snooping through someone's phone is very wrong. I said that if she (my girlfriend) ever felt suspicious, she should ask me, and we could go through my phone together and discuss any messages that concern her. She agreed. She seemed a bit off for a moment, so I asked if she was actually suspicious and wanted to go through my phone together. She declined.

The next morning, alone, I thought about our conversation and wondered if she might be suspicious of something. To be sure, I decided to review my messages, though I had nothing to hide since I've been completely serious with her.

I found some old messages from previous dates. There was no flirting, just reactions to Instagram stories or random chats initiated by them. I knew these messages could cause unnecessary questions and fights, even though they meant nothing to me and I truly love my girlfriend. So, I decided to delete them (they were at least 4 months old) to avoid any potential misunderstanding.

Later, she suddenly asked if I had deleted any messages on my phone recently. I was caught off guard and, even though I understood why she asked, I wasn't expecting her to snoop on my phone. I don't know why, but I defensively said ""No.""

This led to a huge fight where she called me a liar, manipulator, and said she couldn't trust me anymore, accusing me of flirting with other girls. I got very angry at her for snooping on my phone at least twice and not respecting our agreement to go through it together. I was also upset by the names she called me during our fight.

I know saying ""No, I didn't delete any messages"" was stupid, but I was caught off guard and got defensive without thinking. Now, I'm so mad at her that I'm giving her the silent treatment for a few days so she can think about the situation, what she has done, and how her insecurities are affecting our relationship. AITAH?

TL;DR: My (30M) girlfriend (33F) asked my opinion on snooping through a partner's phone. I said it was wrong and we should discuss suspicions openly. She seemed off but denied being suspicious. Later, I reviewed and deleted old, harmless messages from previous dates to avoid misunderstandings. She then asked if I had deleted messages, and I defensively said no. This led to a huge fight where she accused me of lying and flirting. I'm angry she snooped and called me names, so I'm giving her the silent treatment to reflect on her actions.

This led to a huge fight where she called me a liar, manipulator, and said she couldn't trust me anymore, accusing me of flirting with other girls. I got very angry at her for snooping on my phone at least twice and not respecting our agreement to go through it together. I was also upset by the names she called me during our fight.

I know saying ""No, I didn't delete any messages"" was stupid, but I was caught off guard and got defensive without thinking. Now, I'm so mad at her that I'm giving her the silent treatment for a few days so she can think about the situation, what she has done, and how her insecurities are affecting our relationship. AITAH?

TL;DR: My (30M) girlfriend (33F) asked my opinion on snooping through a partner's phone. I said it was wrong and we should discuss suspicions openly. She seemed off but denied being suspicious. Later, I reviewed and deleted old, harmless messages from previous dates to avoid misunderstandings. She then asked if I had deleted messages, and I defensively said no. This led to a huge fight where she accused me of lying and flirting. I'm angry she snooped and called me names, so I'm giving her the silent treatment to reflect on her actions.

I have sensitive hearing and thats my main 'trigger' so to speak. Noise stimulation is my main thing but I always have precautions. I have this incredible pair of headphones which is one of my prize possessions, its blue and white, and I've had it since I was I think 12ish. They block out everything, no joke. And they're smooth and well shaped and 'fashionable' looking so I can wear them around my neck without looking like a weirdo.

My girlfriend has a weird aversion to all of my little 'quirks' as she calls them, all the barely noticeable things I do to deal with my issues (i don't take meds) But she particularly hates those headphones. Last night, she came into our room while I was using them to fall asleep and I opened my eyes to someone waving their hand in front of my face, since I couldn't hear her. She was even more grumpy than usual about the headphones but I thought she'd gotten over it after I set them aside on my bedside table and we'd talked to sleep.

This morning I woke up to them gone, I searched the whole house for them, despite being sure of where I left them, and then asked her if she'd seen them. She told me no, but there was something about her voice that made me suspicious. I waited till she went to the shower and went over her side to see if she'd taken them.

Lo and behold, in the first drawer there they were. I was furious, and waited till she came out to confront her, but the second she saw the headphones she started yelling at me about how I could violate her privacy like that and what a terrible boyfriend I was. I don't quite know how it happened, but I ended up apologising and then making her a coffee to make up for it.

She's gone to class now and I'm confused again. Surely this was her fault? Or am I being dumb? AmItheAsshole?

72,1cs3m1v,AITA for not walking my dog?,"I (16m) am on study leave for exams at school. I am home alone all of the day as my parents work. When I woke up my mum said to me that she took the dogs out early in the morning ( as usual) and she asked me to take them out later on.  

Now have 2 labs so they need 2 walks a day which is what we always do, my mum normally at the crack of dawn and me and my family in the afternoon. My mum loves walking the dogs and gets stressed out if she can’t get out herself! She always comes in the evening unless she is busy.

Now I’m on study leave, studying for a bunch of exams. I also have other things that need doing. But I knew I was going to be free at our normal time we walk them.

My brother has a football practise and we often take the dogs out then.

So we could either:

1) Both take the dogs out so my mum gets to enjoy a walk

2) I take them by myself, which is fine, that is the plan.

My mum decided to take them out herself without telling me.

My dad is fairly chill as he wasn’t actually giving me into trouble for what happened, but just informing me of what my mum was thinking. Apparently she didn’t want to take them out as she had other things to do.

I argued that she made it an issue, as I still had time to walk them, at our usual time, and she should have stayed out of it if she didn’t want them walked.

The rest of the evening she was visibly/audibly annoyed/short with me so was clearly upset when I don’t feel I did anything wrong.

73,1cs3jyd,AITA for not wanting my brother's new girlfriend's sister to (kind of?) join our family vacation?,"My brother (45) is recently divorced and seriously dating a new woman. They live far away and I met her for the first time prior to this incident, awkwardly enough at our father's funeral; he passed away after a long illness about 3 months into their relationship.

My mom has been understandably depressed after losing her husband, so she suggested an extended  
family get together this summer and I offered to plan it. To avoid complexity, I picked some dates over 4th of July, rented a large house in a central location, and invited everyone in her part of the family - my siblings, her  
sister, our cousins, and their spouses and kids.

Brother immediately says the girlfriend and her 2 kids from her previous marriage will be coming. OK, no  
worries. Mom met the kids once, the rest of us haven't, but it will be fine.

A few weeks later, he asks if, since the house is so large, the girlfriend’s sister and her sister's wife could also join us in the house. None of us have ever met these women; many of the family who are coming haven't even met the girlfriend since the relationship is so new. I reach out to each person who's coming privately and ask them if they'd be OK with this, and it's all immediate ""nos"" and a lot of ""... what?"" Also, other spouses/partners of family members understandably want to invite their own families if she can invite hers, and there wouldn’t be room for all. So I go back to him and say, sorry, we're thinking this will just be the core family, of course GF and her kids are still welcome.

I think it's settled, until they come to visit me last weekend for my first real time meeting her. GF mentions the sister and I say, ""Oh, yes, I'm so sorry I won't be able to meet her this summer, but I'd love to sometime, she sounds great.""

She says I might get to meet her this summer after all, because her and her wife are going to go on vacation to the same town as us on the same dates, but stay in a hotel instead of in the house with us. Because they just happen to want to go there and the dates are good for them, and something about child care - my brother and GF are going on another vacation right after this one and they were planning to take the kids to her sister and wife's house in another state to watch them while they travel, so this will save them time because they can pass the kids off in the same town and the sister can drive them to her home while brother and GF go  
to Europe.

I think this sounds bizarre. My brother said if I had kids I would understand and that I was crazy and added that the sister needs money because she's trying to do IVF and could use a free vacation. I obviously can't control where these strangers vacation, and apparently they’ve already booked this hotel, so my brother said they will still go but the sister and her wife won't interact with any of us at all since I was being ""weird.""

I was so rattled by this conversation with my brother, who I usually get along well with, that I'm here to seek a neutral opinion! AITA? What should I do?

74,1cs37ti,AITA for telling my SIL her pregnancy announcement was jarring? ,"Okay so a little background- My husband and I (28F and 32M) have been together and married for 9 years, we have just welcomed our baby girl last July- the first grand baby of both families, everyone was thrilled. Our baby recieves a lot of attention from my husband’s parents since we live around the corner from them. 

I have a sister in law, Camie (26). She LOVES kids and has voiced how much she would love a baby. Camie and her boyfriend have some issues. They always complain to her parents about how they can never afford things, leaving my inlaws to foot the bill, such as: a lawn mower, getting their dog spayed, patio furniture & a vacation to mexico. 

There are a couple people that voiced concern about them starting a family.. Her dad- my FIL, has been adiment about her boyfriend getting serious about their relationship first (putting a ring on it), before they think about having a child. Camie agreed, but stated that it will be a while before they got married as it would be expensive. Her sister, my other SIL- has been hearing up and down about their issues/fights. It seems that every other week they are split up for a day or two before reconnecting. We hardly see Camie’s boyfriend as they usually get into a fight before she makes the trip over to where we live, so he doesn’t come with her.

A couple of months ago Camie asked me what I thought of her having a baby since she was lonely at home. I did not lie, I said I didn’t think it was the best idea since her boyfriend is hardly around, both work wise and emotionally. Plus, they have only been together for a little over a year. 
Skip to last week, Camie comes to visit us with her boyfriend. She gathers us all at the table for a ‘family photo’ before her boyfriend says ‘Sayyy…. Camie’s pregnant!’ As he takes a video. Her sister, with a straight face says “is this a joke?”. Her father, frowns through his smile and looks down at the ground. My husband, shakes his head and walks away. I, put on a huge smile and say Oh my gosh congratulations!. We all gather ourselves up to wish her congratulations, but there are clear bad vibes going on. She doesn’t notice. 

Camie, Upon reviewing the video, texted me, very upset that her announcement video was a dud and that her family was not supportive. She was upset, stating, how could everyone be so excited for me? And not for her?. I told her, that everyone might not be super excited at first and that’s okay, it’s just a bit jarring to hear this news.

Whilst I was initially shocked, it wasn't a total surprise to me either. The split was initiated by my dad, who claimed he had fallen out of love with my mother, which crushed her as she did not see this coming at all. It's been about 5 weeks since the news and it is my dad's 50th birthday soon, which my mum had planned a surprise vacation for us as a family along with their mutual friends to celebrate, in which they had all booked their flights and and time off work to attend. My dad has decided he still wants to go on this vacation and celebrate his milestone birthday and has asked if I will still be joining.

My plans with this are to get a second job and save my money so I can move back to my hometown again, buy a car, etc. I can do this within the span of a year or so. I am also starting my college general education which costs money. 

My mom lives with her boyfriend (45) and my older brother (21). 
I am the only one in the house who is employed and has work experience. My mom, my brother,  and her boyfriend live on government checks. My brother doesn’t work or pay bills. 

Ever since I moved back in my mom’s boyfriend has been treating me like an asset. Saying things like “once you start helping to pay our bills I can save up to buy ___” which is usually a recreational thing like boats, guns, cars, electronics, or pot plants and dabs. 
I tell my mom that my paychecks will not go towards their fun when I am the only one in the house who is working full time, especially when I will not be living with them for all that long. 
She tells me not to listen to him because most of what he says is bullshit, but it pisses me off. 

I’m afraid they see me as a steady source of additional income. I do not have a problem with paying my portion of rent, but it bothers me that my 21 year old brother doesnt pay rent but I’m expected to by her boyfriend.

 It especially bothers me that her boyfriend at his age doesn’t have a job and also barely pays rent. My mom is stuck paying most of the rent. He doesnt have a car and uses her car to drive everywhere. My mom pays for all of his things and then complains to me that she does everything for him. I dont want to help with bills if it means he will be able to save more of his money for his own fun. 


I don’t really know what to do but I am annoyed that I am being treated like a benefit, and I will not pay bills if it means he gets to save his money for stupid shit when I am saving for my tuition and future. He doesn’t even call me by my name, when he talks to my mom, he refers to me as  “your daughter”.

80,1cs2swo,AITA for not wanting my family present in the weeks after I give birth?,"My (20F) boyfriend (25M) and I are expecting our first child this summer. We live together with his mom. His dad passed away years ago, so it's just the three of us. My immediate and extended family lives a few hours away. I left home at 18 because of how dysfunctional and stressful it was living with them. I'm in a better place now and slowly rebuilding trust with my parents.

My parents weren't the most supportive of my pregnancy at first. We'd been very low contact for almost a year when I told them. I've seen them in person a handful of times, but it was at parties thrown by an aunt that I'm still on good terms with. They met my boyfriend once and were very cold with him. Anyway, they've slowly warmed up to the thought of being grandparents, but my dad seems pretty indifferent. My mom has shown an interest in being part of our son's life, but only on her terms. 

I have a birth plan in place that my mom thoroughly disagrees with. Her opinion on it won't change mine, but the fact she thinks that my personal decisions are wrong does bother me a bit. She had two very painful and traumatic births with my brother and I (she almost died), so I think she might be projecting that onto me. 

I only want my boyfriend present for the delivery. It's a very intimate and vulnerable moment that I don't feel comfortable sharing with anyone else. My mom thinks that she should be there because she gave birth to me. I don't understand it but I've never really understood anything she says anyway.

I don't want any family visiting while I'm in the hospital or the weeks after. I want time to adjust to being a parent. I want a chance to bond with my baby before everyone and their mother tries to hold and kiss him. The only exception I've made to any of this is for my boyfriend's mom, who lives with us and will be helping to take care of the baby once my boyfriend goes back to work. She and I have gotten really close and I want her there at the hospital. 

My mom thinks that my boyfriend's mom shouldn't be allowed to see our son if she isn't. I've tried explaining that we live with her and she's been very involved in my pregnancy, to the point of cooking meals for me and helping me understand what to expect. I love having someone to go to for help that won't judge or ridicule me. I've never had that with my own mom. My mom broke down when I explained it and cried that she wants to be involved in her grandson's life, that we're alienating her, that I'm cruel. 

If I let my mom visit, even after we've taken the baby home, our house will be treated as a hotel by my immediate family. We'll be cooking for and housing them for free because they can't afford a hotel. There's no way I'm forcing my boyfriend and his mother to deal with that, and absolutely no chance I'm entertaining it after giving birth.

At the time, I was financially secure and was happy to help her out.

As the years went by, my financial situation changed & just like her, I began living paycheck to paycheck. By this time, she had started dating a guy she met online who revealed to her a few months into dating that he was a millionaire. They married shortly after and suffice to say she has not had to struggle since. There have been a few times I have asked to borrow money, which I have always paid back. It's usually not much, less than $25 or so each time, and she would always oblige with no problems until recently.

The last couple times I asked to borrow money, she said she didn't have it which I found odd. But then I asked to borrow $5 and she said the same thing and I thought it was odd that she told me she didn't have $5 to spare. I know that ever since she got married, her brothers and a couple other friends have tried taking advantage of her new-found wealth by asking to borrow money they never paid back and having her bail them out of situations they put themselves in that have cost her a lot of money.

I started to think that maybe I had forgotten to pay her back money I owed her at some point, so I reached out to her to ask if that was the case. When she told me that wasn't the case (as in, I had always paid her back), I told her I felt hurt because it felt like if I needed her help with something (I used the example if I ended up in jail) that I couldn't reach out to her for help because she couldn't even let me borrow $5. She replied and said that just like her brothers, I needed to learn how to budget my money better and that she can't be the one to bail everyone out. She said when she was struggling, she had to work multiple jobs and did what she had to do.

I replied and said that it was not fair for her to lump me in with her brothers as I have never done anything to take advantage of her & I never would have said something like that to her when I let her borrow my car & anytime she would ask me to borrow money when she was struggling.

I told her I loved her but that I was ending the conversation and she replied that this is why money and friends should never mixed.

84,1cs2mbo,AITA for not appreciating my moms gifts ,"
This is such a first world problem to have so I’m sorry 😭 I invited my mom to my college graduation as a peace offering after 3 years no contact. I try to give her grace/bond with her now that I’m older. She asked my friends to find out what I wanted for my grad gift. Since I was moving to a expensive city, I asked for some house things like a good vacuum and a small nespresso. She opted for a necklace. She asked my friends to find out what kind Id prefer. They told her I only wear earrings and that its always silver. They helped her pick some they thought I’d like. She ended up going with a $2500 rose gold necklace they said no to then later dropped off her old vacuum to me. She said she was upgrading and didn’t want to spend unnecessary money on me since she already got me something pricey. I quickly figured out the real reason. It stunk so bad. I’ve cleaned it, changed the filter etc. It my makes my apartment smell like something died so I don’t use it.

For Christmas she asked me what I wanted and again I said Id love a nespresso machine. It’s something I can’t justify buying myself right now but I know I’d use the hell out of it.

This is such a first world problem to have so I’m sorry 😭 I invited my mom to my college graduation as a peace offering after 3 years no contact. I try to give her grace/bond with her now that I’m older. She asked my friends to find out what I wanted for my grad gift. Since I was moving to a expensive city, I asked for some house things like a good vacuum and a small nespresso. She opted for a necklace. She asked my friends to find out what kind Id prefer. They told her I only wear earrings and that its always silver. They helped her pick some they thought I’d like. She ended up going with a $2500 rose gold necklace they said no to then later dropped off her old vacuum to me. She said she was upgrading and didn’t want to spend unnecessary money on me since she already got me something pricey. I quickly figured out the real reason. It stunk so bad. I’ve cleaned it, changed the filter etc. It my makes my apartment smell like something died so I don’t use it.

For Christmas she asked me what I wanted and again I said Id love a nespresso machine. It’s something I can’t justify buying myself right now but I know I’d use the hell out of it. She gave me another rose gold necklace. This one had to be for a child because it didn’t fit my neck. Also she got herself the upgraded version of the nespresso I wanted which made me feel weird.

I am LIVID if we actually owed 10k I would pay it but this company is the definition of corruption and I'm 99% the debt is totally bogus as I'm very organized and make sure our bills are paid.

However, Erin and I had a pretty significant falling out recently. It was over a misunderstanding, but things got pretty heated before we cleared the air and resolved things. Now, we're back to being really close friends, which makes her decision even more confusing.

So, my confusion stems from the fact that Erin is choosing to go with her high school friends, whom she’s known for over eight years, instead of sticking to our plans. It feels like a bit of a slap in the face, especially considering the money.

88,1cs2b9g,AITA for thinking my wife is materialistic,"I met my wife overseas and we got married quickly after meeting. 
Currently we are in a long distance relationship 
as I've filed for her immigration to the United States and we
are waiting for that process which can take a few years. 

&nbsp;

Recently my wife looked up the price of her engagement ring and found out it
was worth approx 300. She brought it up to me, and I felt embarrassed because 
it was a diamond ring which I thought was worth more. We had our 1 year anniversary coming
up and I was planning on getting her a gold necklace. Once she told me the rings value 
I tried to make up for the embarrassment I felt by sending her some extra money so she can 
pick up a gold necklace of her choice. (We are long distance so I cannot buy it directly and give
it to her myself)

&nbsp;

A little backstory, before our marriage 
I was looking at wedding rings and when I talked with my mother about it, she told me she
had a diamond ring which she would like to give me to give her. I looked at the ring and it 
was a good looking design and so I agreed that I would give it to my wife as it also 
felt like it had sentimental value. When I gave her the ring I never mentioned the value
because, quite frankly, I had no idea how much it was worth. 

&nbsp;

Anyway fast forward to today and because we got married quickly there is still a 
reception upcoming and I have planned a honeymoon. So we are talking and she starts 
talking about how much gold we (my family) are going to give her for the wedding.
In our culture it is customary for grooms family to give give the bride jewelry.

&nbsp;

She tells me that people around her are making fun of her and her family because I didn't 
give her any jewelry as of yet and if we don't give her any jewelry during the wedding
reception her cousins etc will make comments to her family about how she didn't get any
jewelry. This is causing her anxiety. She said that once she found out about the value of the ring and the
fact that we didn't give her jewelry it made her think that she has no worth in my eyes or my families eyes 
that we don't want to give her anything expensive. 

&nbsp;

She compared the value of the ring I gave her to the one her sisters got during their 
weddings and said mine was the cheapest. She also compared the jewelry that her sisters got
and said that I have not given her anything and she is worried that we will not give her 
any jewelry. 

&nbsp;

She asked me if it is wrong for her to expect jewelry from me, and I told her no it's not 
wrong because it is cultural and perhaps we should have already.

&nbsp;

I guess I'm worried that whatever jewelry I plan to give her for the wedding reception she will
think it is not enough and I will tell me it made her feel like I don't value her or that 
her worth in my eyes is that she doesn't deserve expensive jewelry.

We both work incredibly demanding jobs and don’t get much time off. Our friend group also doesn’t get to see each other very often as we all work and some travel for work a lot. 

My brother is not close with his in laws. They are racist, religious fanatics and just awful people especially to their daughter my brothers wife. Anyway he told her about the fishing trip and she said he had to go with her to her parents home town to celebrate her sisters kids first birthday. 

My brother told me when I was having dinner with them this week. I told her that the kid won’t remember my brother not being there and I did already invite to this trip where as she only mentioned the birthday on Saturday. I told her that I’d rather have my brother there with me as both him and her get to do what they want. She wants to go to a birthday and so does my brother. 

She called me an asshole at the table for downplaying her family. I simply responded that she has stated she hates her own family so why does she care? She got up and left. I left soon after and called my brother on Monday. He is going with his wife even though he said he’d rather go with me and our friends.

Her siblings have done some cruel things like exclude her from the hospital when her sister gave birth. Everyone else in the family was invited except my SiL.

They never come to my place as she doesn’t like my house or how I live my life.

We have also had many fights where I call her out on how she treats me which is similar to how her family treats her. She will get nasty towards me and call me a dog or say she couldn’t imagine how shitty my life is. So I feel nothing towards her family and frankly only tolerate her.

90,1cs1x6c,AITA for being mad about Taylor Swift concert situation ,"Weird title but I'll explain...

Around a year ago me and wife planned a trip for later this year to go see the Eras tour in another state. I initially was hesitant because of the cost but I came around because I really wanted to share this experience with my wife. She's a huge fan and I've started to become one myself, so much so I'm actually really excited about our trip.

Then this Sunday her best friend out of the blue text her saying she ""loves the new Swift album"" and ""wishes she could go to the tour with her""... My wife pretty much instantly says her friend can have my ticket.

Of course when she tells me I am not happy. I really want to go with her to share this experience. I've practically turned into a full blown Swiftie - I bought my wife copies of every album with Taylor-themed 3D printed stands, multiple signed vinyls of the new album, all kinds of merch, custom gifts with Taylor lyrics printed all over them... I've tried to be the perfect Swiftie husband. So yeah I'm pretty mad at the fact she just wanted to push me aside for somebody who didn't give AF about Swift two weeks ago.

So we come to the agreement that isn't gonna work... Well now my wife has the idea of selling our 2 floor tix for 3 less expensive tickets. Ok - not ideal but whatever. Well you don't get paid for selling tickets till after the event. Now my wife expects me to cover $7000 until she ""might"" find someone to buy our tickets. I'm not poor but I'm also not in a position to just loan out seven grand with only a potential chance of repayment. So I tell her I am not comfortable doing that, put our tickets up for sale  first to make sure we recoup our money before ommiting to buying new tickets. She isn't comfortable doing that. So guess we are at an impasse then right? Her friend will need to find a ticket...

Well this morning I wake to a bunch of ""don't be mad"" messages from my wife... She took 7k out of my HELOC to buy these tickets and now is trying to sell ours. So I'm pretty mad about that because at the very least I'm stuck paying hundreds in fees and interest even if she recoups the money spent. She says she might even make a few thousand profit which I guess would be ok.

Am I wrong here? Am I being unreasonable?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-14,"AITA for being mad about Taylor Swift concert situation  Weird title but I'll explain...

Around a year ago me and wife planned a trip for later this year to go see the Eras tour in another state. I initially was hesitant because of the cost but I came around because I really wanted to share this experience with my wife. She's a huge fan and I've started to become one myself, so much so I'm actually really excited about our trip.

Then this Sunday her best friend out of the blue text her saying she ""loves the new Swift album"" and ""wishes she could go to the tour with her""... My wife pretty much instantly says her friend can have my ticket.

Of course when she tells me I am not happy. I really want to go with her to share this experience. I've practically turned into a full blown Swiftie - I bought my wife copies of every album with Taylor-themed 3D printed stands, multiple signed vinyls of the new album, all kinds of merch, custom gifts with Taylor lyrics printed all over them... I've tried to be the perfect Swiftie husband. So yeah I'm pretty mad at the fact she just wanted to push me aside for somebody who didn't give AF about Swift two weeks ago.

So we come to the agreement that isn't gonna work... Well now my wife has the idea of selling our 2 floor tix for 3 less expensive tickets. Ok - not ideal but whatever. Well you don't get paid for selling tickets till after the event. Now my wife expects me to cover $7000 until she ""might"" find someone to buy our tickets. I'm not poor but I'm also not in a position to just loan out seven grand with only a potential chance of repayment. So I tell her I am not comfortable doing that, put our tickets up for sale  first to make sure we recoup our money before ommiting to buying new tickets. She isn't comfortable doing that. So guess we are at an impasse then right? Her friend will need to find a ticket...

Well this morning I wake to a bunch of ""don't be mad"" messages from my wife... She took 7k out of my HELOC to buy these tickets and now is trying to sell ours. So I'm pretty mad about that because at the very least I'm stuck paying hundreds in fees and interest even if she recoups the money spent. She says she might even make a few thousand profit which I guess would be ok.

We both work full time and have active family, community, and social lives.

I do them occasionally or if he hasn’t gotten to them for a few days and it bothers me. For the most part, he does it every night and we “close” the kitchen so to speak with kids doing the surfaces/ floors and putting away the food. A few times, it’s piled up over the course of a few days and I’ve kinda been like, “so you gonna get to that or should I do it?” And he says he’ll get to it, or does it shortly after my asking. If he happens to do them during the day, and doesn’t do that night’s dishes because he says he does the dishes once a day and he’ll “do them tomorrow”. I don’t care that much because I’m not doing them and they usually get done within 2 days.  

Recently, the dishes hadn’t been done in a few days and I asked “hey, the dishes haven’t been done, when are you going to do them?” and he (hindsight: passive aggressively) started doing the dishes and I didn’t think anything of it.

He said that if I ever don’t feel like cooking dinner or doing laundry, he doesn’t ask me if I’m going to do it.

She cares about me deeply, but is so anxious and controlling. She lashes out when she feels like she's losing control over me and isn't good at expressing her emotions. We're in a better place now, but it can be difficult to open up about my life without her getting jealous and insecure.

I've been involved in a great relationship with my boyfriend for almost 2 months now. Things are still very new, but we're pretty serious about each other and have been having casual conversations about a future together (how long we'd like to wait to get engaged and stuff like that). My parents like my boyfriend, so I mentioned that we had been talking about future plans. My mom seemed excited for me and I felt like things were good. 

The next day, I was in the other room and my mom had her housekeeper over. I heard my name mentioned and started listening in. They were talking quietly, but I was able to catch a lot of what was being talked about. My mom made it sound like we were getting engaged immediately and were moving way too fast, which isn't what she told me at all. Her housekeeper started saying how suspicious that was and how I better have an escape plan because something wasn't right. I thought my mom would speak out in my boyfriend's defense, but instead she started agreeing with her housekeeper and saying that she was going to have private conversations with him to make sure everything was alright. They spent a lot of time talking about how worried they were about me and it all really rubbed me the wrong way. 

Afterwards, I tried to talk to her about it, saying that I didn't appreciate her talking about my relationship behind my back. She denied it all, saying that the only reason she didn't speak up about my boyfriend was because her housekeeper was a victim of DA and my mom didn't want her to feel like she was arguing with her. She also told me that I didn't understand the situation because I hadn't been abused. This really hurt because I'm a victim of SA, which my mom doesn't know about. I've been through therapy for a while and know what red flags to look for, so it hurts that my mom doesn't trust me enough to make my own decisions.

We haven’t sent the invites out yet, but agreed it needs to be on a weekend so that people can come more easily and enjoy the dinner/party and I’m flying back home for this long weekend especially for it.

IMO, if this person was going to be uncomfortable with someone reclining the seat that they paid for, they should've selected a seat behind one that didn't recline (like those behind the exit row), or if finances allowed, a seat with more leg room. By the time we landed I was FUMING.

(Extra context when we were younger we had big parties (20+ kids) and we'd always both get presents and invite both friends - our b-days are months apart so 2 parties), she made a point of always making a cake that was over the top and recently we instead started doing drinks with a few friends and for my b-day go to our grandmas (her mom she refuses to be around) because my birthday falls around Easter. And this year I was busy graduating and working and didn't have time to go for some cake with her alone and I haven't cared about my cake for years and that has been a problem for 12 years cuz it takes her role away. This year I told her that it's my day and would prefer to go out with my boyfriend then her. She then started whishing my sibling ''happy you got a baby sister day'' and went on and on about how ''I robbed her of her I gave birth and gave life and became a mother day''.  


And that brings us to today where out of nowhere she starts it up again and called aside from repeating everything added that I am selfish and only think about myself for saying my b-day is my day not her (as in she wants to be celebrated on my b-day) and my sibling for not wanting to be celebrated for getting a sister.  


So are we the aholes for saying our b-days aren't about her?  


PS. If this is confusing she often goes on random tangents, that's how prom became b-day. We can answer questions or ubdate if necesarry.",3.0,-0.009559966623783112,0,0
99,1cs0yua,AITA for making a woman uncomfortable on a bus trip?,"Hello reddit, let me know if I'm the asshole?

I had a 9 hour long bus ride with a very limited space for legs, even though I' not a big person (50 kg/170 cm), it still made me very uncomfortable and lacking in space. A girl sitting in front of me reclined her seat taking away from that little space I had even more and I asked her to please straighten her seat explaining that I don't have enough space for my legs. She apologized and complied. Half an hour later she reclined her seat again. I asked her again. Apology and straightening up followed. Half an hour, the same again. Then she gave me an excuse 'the seat is broken it keeps falling backwards'. I told her I understand and I won't bother her again. But I came with a plan to fix the situation (or so I thought), I will raise my knees to my chest level, pressing my whole leg from my ankles through my shins to my knees against the seat, kind of curling in a semi-fetal position, that way I take up absolutely all space, but I get to 'slide' forward with my butt and my back is in a slightly reclined position, therefore I am half sitting only and also curled up (basically I did a 'reclining', but just with my body without actually taking away space from a person behind me), this position made me more comfy and I finally fell asleep (the bus took off at 1 AM, so I was desperate for sleep). I slept for almost 6 hours. When I woke up a woman in front of me was \*pissed\*. She very angrily asked me if I could stop ramming my knees into her back as she can't sit comfortably. I apologized and told her that because her seat is broken and keeps reclining, that was the only solution I could think of to prevent the seat from 'falling' on me as it leaves me with virtually no space. Or I could keep bothering her and asking to straighten it up every time it falls on me. She said okay. Then she turned around, said something to her partner, they swapped seats and the seat never fell on me ever again for the rest of the trip. The moment she sat down into her partner's seat, the seat she sat into 'fell' onto my mom who was sitting in a parallel seat by my side.

Idk if I'm really TA, but my mom says I am (she's shorter than me) and that seats were not that uncomfortable and that the woman kept turning back at me (most likely trying to ask me to stop ramming my knees into her seat, but I was asleep) while I was sleeping, I basically 'trapped' her in an uncomfortable situation for several hours.

Around 3pm my brother swept the floor, I did the dishes and took trash out and fed and watered the dogs, and picked up the kitchen and living room, and did one load of laundry and my other brother dusted and cleaned the cat litter. 

Around 6pm my dad got home and was pretty cranky, which is understandable, he worked all day after an exhausting weekend. I understand. I scooped out supper for everyone and we sat and ate and watched TV together.

Little history, I was induced with my first two pregnancies because of low fluid with one and cholestasis with the other.

We always wanted a bigger family, so we were thrilled when we were pregnant again with a healthy baby.

I will be a SAHM once our 3rd arrives. I’ll be homeschooling as well and we’ve looked at our finances and will be OK.

Here comes the argument last Friday.

107,1crzg9m,AITA for not playing pos 5 in an AD Dota match,"This is so silly to even ask (for people who know DotA)...but let me try do a short description.

I played an AD match with 2 buddies. We won the game (my score KDA was 6-1-23) in the end but one of the buddies (his score was 5-8-9, he was playing pos 1) I played with, went on a rant after the game was done that he didn't have a good game and it was mostly down to me. He blamed most of his deaths due to me not putting enough wards up or not playing a pos 5 properly. Now, in all fairness, I took his criticism and later checked the replay in more detail to actually see how many of his deaths could honestly be blamed on wards...and to me it seemed he could have easily avoided 5 of his deaths just by better positioning, 2 were a team fight that gone wrong and 1 (or 2) could have been maybe blamed on lack of wards. Now, I've been in his situation, but never thought of blaming someone else for my mistakes and just because if I was having a bad game, to try and ruin my teammates game over it...

Later after our game and after I watched the replay and noted my findings, I sent him what I found and said that it's not fair for him to blame me for wards when most of his deaths could have been avoided as he had overextended himself or not payed attention to minimap. Then he went on a bigger rant about me leaving him in a lane (I announced me leaving before hand), bad itemization (I dont think I needed much items, had shukuchi, mars spear (stun) and mirana's arrow (stun) and Queen of pain ult), and so on...all this blame being put on me and my play but not a single mention of his own actions or mistakes...

I played an AD match with 2 buddies. We won the game (my score KDA was 6-1-23) in the end but one of the buddies (his score was 5-8-9, he was playing pos 1) I played with, went on a rant after the game was done that he didn't have a good game and it was mostly down to me. He blamed most of his deaths due to me not putting enough wards up or not playing a pos 5 properly. Now, in all fairness, I took his criticism and later checked the replay in more detail to actually see how many of his deaths could honestly be blamed on wards...and to me it seemed he could have easily avoided 5 of his deaths just by better positioning, 2 were a team fight that gone wrong and 1 (or 2) could have been maybe blamed on lack of wards. Now, I've been in his situation, but never thought of blaming someone else for my mistakes and just because if I was having a bad game, to try and ruin my teammates game over it...

Later after our game and after I watched the replay and noted my findings, I sent him what I found and said that it's not fair for him to blame me for wards when most of his deaths could have been avoided as he had overextended himself or not payed attention to minimap. Then he went on a bigger rant about me leaving him in a lane (I announced me leaving before hand), bad itemization (I dont think I needed much items, had shukuchi, mars spear (stun) and mirana's arrow (stun) and Queen of pain ult), and so on...all this blame being put on me and my play but not a single mention of his own actions or mistakes...

Nothing to do with my boyfriend. Hes wonderful. But his family, particularly his mom, is insufferable. For context, I am not a part of their culture. They are a multi-generational, religious, hispanic family, and I am a white girl with no family and no religion. So I stand out.

When I first met his family I was actually really excited, I talked with his mom and step-dad for hours, watched a movie with everyone, etc. I went to church on Easter with them. I gave his brother and sister parts of my personal computer and my monitors. I gave his sister my piano. I would talk to his mom every time I went over to see him. I started finding that she was extremely judgemental and just overall very unpleasant to talk to. She judged me for my medications, what food I eat, insisted I repair my relationship with my abusive and addict family, criticized me for dying my hair, getting piercings, etc. She would talk over me, start vacuuming in the middle of my sentences (shes obsessed with the vacuum), start talking to someone else while im talking, and all that just made me not want to associate with her.

I eventually could not handle my home life and made an agreement with his mom to pay her $600 monthly to stay in my boyfriends room. Which, mind you, is the smallest room in the house. And also share a bathroom with 4 people. She insisted on seeing my mental diagnoses and my medications on move in. She also pushed and pushed for $700 monthly even though I specifically said $600. I just gave in because I didnt want to cause problems. After I moved in, I had to fight for weeks to get keys to the house, too.

From there I kept to myself. I said hi and bye but I never really participated in family stuff. I had been judged and scrutinized every time I was around his family so I tended to avoid them.

My sister is 10 years older than me and she's always been rude to me. Generally speaking, she is just rude but she's extra rude to younger siblings. She also acts like she can boss us around all the time.  She even said to our dad, ""Yeah I'm a bitch"".  She gets away with it though because ppl say she works in a male dominated industry and needs to act like that to be taken seriously 🙄. 

 A lot of the things she says are judgemental and invasive so she's not enjoyable to talk to. She also shuts ppl down a lot so the conversation usually ends when she's around. I just started avoiding her because she's super critical and argumentative but then she will send a text message saying, ""Sorry that we weren't able to spend much time together, we should get some coffee or something"" 🙄. 

This weekend, she kept asking about work even thoy she knows I'm unemployed. I graduated from uni 2 weeks ago and I've had health issues for the past 3 years so I've been resting and visiting my doctor these past few weeks. I answered her questions at first because they were generally about career stuff. But then the next day she doubled down and started asking more invasive questions, going as far as to ask ""You've got a lot of money?? (Scoff)"" when I said I've worked for the past two school years straight so I'm just taking a little break. Then she asked how I was going to pay for my upcoming trip and wanted to know what was all paid for when I said I got funding from my university.

It was obvious that I was tired of her questions but she kept going. When I tried to change the topic she kept going back to it. She wasn't saying anything helpful and only made discouraging comments (""Rent is too expensive for you to move to X city and get a job there"").  After she left she sent the same text message about grabbing coffee.  This time I just ignored the text completely but it's almost been a day and I feel like I should respond.

Afterwards, my friend went full FERAL at me. She said that she was “focusing on herself” and that “she didn’t care” on what happened to my program. If you are/were a member of a marching band, you KNOW how hard we work and the time we put in. I see the kids in band more than my family during the fall. So of course, this made me very upset, considering that she is my best friend and she knows how hard I work. She also asked me to listen to her petty arguments MULTIPLE times, but when it’s about me, she immediately says no. Note that signing a change.org petition doesn’t take long.

I’m not sure if this was the right thing to do since she is kinda messed up in the head, but I don’t think that is a plausible excuse to be self-centered.

 I will also state that we are both freshman in highschool, so I think maturity plays a factor in this.

Ex moved 20 hours away when our youngest was five months old. He was following a better job. Plus he was bored of our home state and wanted a change. He told me this before he left and when I asked about the kids he told me he'd still be an involved dad, just at a distance. I have primary custody. He sees them for three weeks in the summer and every other Christmas/Thanksgiving. It's not a lot and the kids aren't very close to him and have grown to enjoy the time with him less as they get older. Part of this is because they don't feel like he makes enough of an effort. Another part is the fact he got married 2 years after the move and he has more children with his current wife. So the kids feel replaced. I can't blame them. So I put them in therapy to help them through this.

I hardly ever hear from ex or his wife. I get three emails from him a year and maybe five replies if I'm lucky (which is him giving me dates and me asking him questions and getting replies to those). The kids do not have a close relationship or any type of bond with their half siblings.

Sunday morning we got the shock of our lives when my ex's wife showed up with her and ex's kids and said she came to get my kids to spend the day with them and so they could be with her and their half siblings. My kids said they didn't want to go and walked away without saying anything else to her. She looked so offended at the door and told me to make sure they get ready. I told her no and told her she didn't get to just arrive. I told her they were spending Mother's Day with me, their mom. Then I closed the door and she stayed with her kids for a few minutes before leaving. Apparently she got home later that night (they flew apparently) because both she and ex sent numerous emails saying I should have sent the kids with her and made them celebrate her for a change since she's been their stepmom most of their lives and they have siblings who wanted to see them. Ex also claimed if I refused to share, I should have invited them in to spend some time all together. They called me a bitch and unreasonable. This continued all day yesterday.

My ex and I broke up, and were never married, when I was pregnant with our youngest child who is now 12 and our oldest is almost 14. Ex moved 20 hours away when our youngest was five months old. He was following a better job. Plus he was bored of our home state and wanted a change. He told me this before he left and when I asked about the kids he told me he'd still be an involved dad, just at a distance. I have primary custody. He sees them for three weeks in the summer and every other Christmas/Thanksgiving. It's not a lot and the kids aren't very close to him and have grown to enjoy the time with him less as they get older. Part of this is because they don't feel like he makes enough of an effort.

117,1crx0x5,AITA WFH husband makes me feel like crap,"It’s been 4 years now since the pandemic hit and my husband’s job went fully remote. At first he was very overwhelmed, stressed beyond anything i had ever seen in him before, and he was working way past 5pm daily. For 3 months then I was laid off due to covid so was home doing whatever all day and the daily structure was this: Anytime he needed to vent, wanted to talk/take a break, or just generally wanted my attention, he would come out of his office and i would have to drop whatever i was doing, be the supportive wife, and listen and help. However anytime I had a question or wanted to tell him anything i would get smacked down and given a lecture on how he’s at work rn and can’t talk and how inappropriate it is of me to interrupt. Ok I get it. Ur stressed. Fine, i let it slide and went back to work once the covid restrictions lifted. Fast forward to today and he has a new job that is WAY less stressful and extremely flexible. So much so that he is able to take off for hours long bike rides in the middle of the day sometimes, jet off to the record store, or quit work 2 hours early to go to a baseball game. My situation is that i am now unemployed (long story, not happy about it) and have been home again like during the lockdown for the last several months and his dismissive behavior has not changed. He constantly comes out of his room to complain AT me, then the second i start talking i basically get the same lecture over again. Essentially whenever he wants my attention, like he has the RIGHT to it, I’m supposed to be there all supportive and attentive and considerate. But if I even suggest like “hey, is your workday slow today? Wanna run to the store with me?” Or “hey, i see you’re just browsing the internet rn, wanna cut out early and do something?” I’m the bad guy who is being an inconsiderate monster for not understanding his workload and how he needs to be available if anything comes up. Yea. I freaking get it. And i’m sick of being dismissed like this constantly when its me talking but anytime its something he thinks of that he wants to do its fine. 

So AITA here? Look, i understand clearly that he is the only true judge whether he can get away from work that day, and if he gets an email he has to respond quickly, but the flexibility i see him allow for himself and never for me is infuriating and hurtful. Even in cases of small things like wanting to take a walk (15-20mins max) or to go look at the garden (5 mins) and i get the whole lecture and and made to feel like an insignificant pos. I’m so tired of being talked AT and treated like whatever i’m doing is disposable. We have had this conversation dozens of times and he still doesn’t seem to get that what he is doing feels unfair to me. It always ends with him huffing away back to his hole and me just trying to stay out of his way and be quiet until he comes back out to squawk at me again.

118,1crx07i,AITA for telling my wife she needs to visit the dentist?,"It started about a year ago. My wife developed horrible breath. Breath that makes you want to puke. She brushes her teeth every morning and night. But she also has cavities. 

Sometimes I get woken up by nothing more than her breathing in my face. It smells like her tongue has been shaking hands with Bigfoot's prostate, all day, every day. 

Her parents never took her to the dentist as a child so I believe she is scared. Every time i bring it up she gets defensive and says we don't have the money or we don't have insurance. I have at least $2000 available at all times, so it's just an excuse.

We were at a school function for my daughter earlier today and as we were waiting in line she was talking into my face and I got a whiff of her sulfuric ass breath. I made a face and backed away from her. She got mad and wouldn't talk to me until we sat down to eat.

While we were eating she said I was being a jerk for making that face. To which I replied, in a whisper that nobody else could hear, ""I wasn't being a jerk. It was just my reaction. You have cavities that need to be filled before they rot your teeth out."" 

She wouldn't talk to me until we left. I said I was sorry but that didn't change the fact that she needed to see a dentist. She replied ""you embarrassed me in front of everyone. We don't have money or insurance and I don't care about a cavity. You're just overexaggerating to make me feel bad in front of everyone"". That was the last thing she said to me.

The thing about it, they've been in a relationship for 3 years, and have been broken up but in contact due to their pets. She explained to me that for a couple reasons, before moving to my country, she had to stay with him for a couple months, in which they had sex, altought she says thats there are no feelings involved(which I'm fine with cause we didnt even knew eachother back then).

They still talk on a regular basis sometimes when he sends pictures of the pets and ask how she's doing and all that, which again I can understand to a certain degree. 

I really don't wanna be the asshole that doesn't allow her to go see her pets, cause I know that they mean a lot to her but the whole situation is not something I'm not willing to go through cause it's really uncomfortable for me and she agrees and says that she's looking for other ways to do it, but it's not looking good and she can't promise that she can find a way.

I had heard stories from my mother and her family about how they used to bathe in the river and swim in the clean water when they were kids. My cousins and I were very excited to experience this ourselves. Accompanied by two of my aunts, one of my uncles, and all my cousins, we decided to swim in the river around 11 AM.

The tiny rocks around the river were sharp and spikey, and the ground was extremely hot due to the time of day. We left our footwear far away out of fear of them being stolen or lost. As we headed towards the river, everyone's feet were burning, so we all ran to get our feet underwater to escape the burns. After swimming for about an hour, we decided to go back and change. The ground was even hotter than before. Everyone managed to run and reach our nearby house, except me. Every step I took felt like walking over embers. The tiny rocks made it impossible for me to even jog.

There was a small stream of mildly clean water nearby and when I couldn't keep walking, I chose to stand in that water. I noticed that everyone had gone except another uncle of mine (we'll call him Uncle L), who was watching us enjoy in the water and taking pictures but hadn't joined us in swimming. I told Uncle L about the hot ground and how difficult it was to walk on it. He told me to keep walking. I tried again, but it felt like walking over lava, and the rocks were piercing my skin. I jumped back into the stream and realized I couldn't walk anymore. I asked Uncle L to bring my sandals, which were near our house, but he refused. I told him my feet were burning and that the rocks in the water were also hurting me, but he was stubborn and didn't care to help.

Realizing I had no other option, I started running as if my life depended on it. Each step felt like my feet would need to be amputated. I sobbed all the way to the house and finally reached it. My feet were burnt and red, feeling as if they were on fire for about 15-20 minutes. I put my feet under some ice and bandaged them, which made me feel only a little better. When I told everyone about Uncle L's refusal to bring my sandals, his wife (we'll call her Aunt L) sided with him.

122,1crwdgr,AITA for not wanting to get a new dog?,"I (29M) have a wife (25F) who works at an animal shelter. A beautiful fluffy white dog is currently in said shelter, and my wife wants to bring her home.

My wife has absolutely fallen in love with the dog, who she has already named. I have met this dog; and she does seem to be a genuinely good, well-natured dog. We have a Labrador already, who's always happy to play with other dogs, and our yard is plenty big enough for two dogs. Plus the potential new dog will already be spayed and have her shots and stuff - after adoption fees, the main expense would be food and eventually vet care down the road. Assuming a meet'n'greet between our Lab and this one goes well, it really does seem like an alright fit.

So here's where my concerns come into play. I bought a new car recently, and have a $20k loan that I've started paying off. This is a lot of money to me, and I would really like to work on building up as much money as I can to be able to get rid of it as early as possible. My parents have sent me a lot of money (around $9k) this year to help me with some expenses incurred by my shitty previous car, including $5k towards the cost of my new one; and I can't imagine how it'd look to them if I turn around and respond by bringing another dog home. On top of that, my wife has had some mental health struggles for the last few months, to the point that she needed to leave her original position at work and take a lower-paying one. In the aftermath of that, while she has seemed to be doing better at the new position and she likes her psychiatrist, it feels to me like she still has a lot to work through and that I've had to pick up a lot of slack in caring for our current dog. And I don't think adding another dog for us to take care of, while I'm paying more money per month than I'm used to and she still isn't feeling her best, is a particularly good idea.

Less than half an hour ago, we had an argument over text about this. I told her that I'm not certain we can afford the dog, and that I don't think getting another dog is a viable solution to how she's feeling when she's less involved than she used to be in caring for the one we have; she told me that it's basically all her fault then that I'm saying no. That dog will be up for adoption by this time next week - if I'm the asshole here, I need to know quickly if I'm going to reverse course and move forward with getting ready for the new dog.

123,1crw9m4,AITA for starting an argument because my boyfriend took a taxi home with a girl? ,"My (26F) boyfriend (26M) and I have been together for 1.5 years and live together. He was working last night (he works in a bar) and decided to stay after work for some drinks with people that he works with. He said he wouldn’t be out too late, then I receive texts saying it will be later, and later etc etc. I fell asleep and woke up around 1:30am and he wasn’t home. I thought to check his location on find my friends to see if he was making his way home, and he was going in the opposite direction to where we live. 

Once he got home I confronted him about it and asked why he was way out on the other side of town. He obviously wasn’t expecting that I’d have checked his location, and I then watched him lie to my face by saying that he was in a taxi taking his male coworker home. He’d forgotten that we’d both been to this male coworkers home before, and it was nowhere near where he was that night. I asked calmly why he was lying to me and he eventually told me that he’d actually gotten into a taxi with his female coworker (21F) and dropped her off home before coming home himself.

I asked why he lied to me, and he said that he thought I would react badly if he told me the truth. I’ve not reacted badly to anything like this before and am generally not that jealous of a person. I feel as though the fact he lied about it has given me a reason to worry, rather than the act itself?

He was working last night (he works in a bar) and decided to stay after work for some drinks with people that he works with. He said he wouldn’t be out too late, then I receive texts saying it will be later, and later etc etc. I fell asleep and woke up around 1:30am and he wasn’t home. I thought to check his location on find my friends to see if he was making his way home, and he was going in the opposite direction to where we live. 

Once he got home I confronted him about it and asked why he was way out on the other side of town. He obviously wasn’t expecting that I’d have checked his location, and I then watched him lie to my face by saying that he was in a taxi taking his male coworker home. He’d forgotten that we’d both been to this male coworkers home before, and it was nowhere near where he was that night. I asked calmly why he was lying to me and he eventually told me that he’d actually gotten into a taxi with his female coworker (21F) and dropped her off home before coming home himself.

I asked why he lied to me, and he said that he thought I would react badly if he told me the truth. I’ve not reacted badly to anything like this before and am generally not that jealous of a person. I feel as though the fact he lied about it has given me a reason to worry, rather than the act itself?

I also know she and her husband both have sizeable life insurance policies so if god forbid, one dies, they’ll be okay.

However, she also signed a prenup. Which again, I think is smart. But according to my daughter, she’d get a very small settlement.

So, my husband (her father) and I set up a “just in case” account. If she and her husband divorce, she’ll have money to fall back on just in case. If they remain married past the time my husband and I die, it’ll just be added to what she’ll inherit. 

I didn’t intend on telling her about it unless it happened but my husband pointed out that if she was ever in a situation where she wanted to leave but worried she financially couldn’t, it’d be good for her to know she has a Plan B.

So, we told her and she was a little surprised. She said she appreciated it but felt we were “rooting against her”. I said we love her husband and hope they have a long, healthy marriage. We have always been supportive. But this is similar to the prenup. A just in case. A last resort. 

Well, she told her husband and he’s pissed at us as well, saying that we don’t trust him. I said it’s looking out for our daughter and really is no different from the prenup. I added that just as he’ll always want to protect his daughter, we’ll always want to protect ours.

I’m prefacing this because, in my toiletry bag I do have a little portal vibrator, as embarrassing as that is to admit. I didn’t think to remove it.

At the party a guy was hitting on me and I was considering going somewhere private with him, but decided against it. 

So I excused myself to the bathroom, and that’s when I realised I had my toy in my toiletry bag. 

I decided to use it and get myself a clear mind to not make bad decisions. I did what I did, quietly and discreetly I thought. But as I left the bathroom there were people in the hall and my friends roommate asked me what I was doing in there because she could hear a buzzing sound. 

Without thinking I said “oh, I was just brushing my teeth” and walked away. A few minutes later she comes over to me again to ask what I did as she knows I don’t have an electric one. (How?)

So I said I turned my friends toothbrush on to make white noise so no one could hear me pee. She said my friends one wasn’t charged (why does she know that?)

I told her she was being really weird, and she just kept pressing me, in front of everyone. So I lead her and my friend out the room and told them the truth. My friend found it funny, especially the pee shyness lie. So I thought all is fine, the roommate didn’t say anything. 

I go into the kitchen, get some water and then walk back out into the living room and the vibe is so weird. A few girls are giving me grossed out looks and a few guys are looking creepy and leery.

Anyways, my gf and I are sexually active and we've done our best to cover it up but I accidentally left a planned parenthood card on the table, after a pregnancy scare. My mom found it and asked me ""So how long have you guys been having sex?"" Let this show that my mom has tried to talk about sex with me for a long time and each time she brings up the topic, I try my best to respectfully shoot it down before the yelling match starts. This time, I got embarrassed because it was out of nowhere and that's something really personal of mine. I told her to stop being nosey and to stop trying to talk about sex with me because it was none of her business. She didn't listen though and tried to carry on the conversation like I hadn't just said that. I had to raise my voice over the volume of hers to get her to stop and then she got mad at me for being disrespectful. Anyways, after that altercation I was feeling embarrassed, exposed and angry. I decided since she couldn't respect my boundaries, I didn't want her following me on social media so I took her off of mine. A few days later she found out and got mad saying that I'm mean to her and that I don't want to have a relationship with her and that since I don't need her I can do everything myself and that I don't know shit.

134,1crv2ka,AITA for protecting myself against this group? ,"In 2021 I joined a fraternal organization…later that year another member and I went into business together eventually called me a year later and said he was out. Gave me control of everything. A month later he comes back and says you owe me my investment back and a buyout. I told him the business was worth nothing there’s nothing to buy you out in fact we owe money so if we go this route you maybe responsible for debts of the business but I’ll just let you walk like you said. 

He then turns the whole fraternal org against me… even tries to get me kicked out, saying I “defrauded” him… even though he quit. 

He also tried to sue me, I defended without a lawyer and he ultimately settled. The fraternal org dropped the kicking out stuff but their minds were poisoned. 

A year goes by while while his suit is pending,once dropped then I start coming back reengaging with the fraternal org. They are all rude to me, angry, and treat me like im the one who did something wrong. They then start violating my membership rights etc. over something they had no business in, so I sued them, eventually theiru lawyer says “they want no contact and to be left alone” some months go by and then they send me something in the mail, then. Try and get me kicked out again for ignoring them, like they’re legal representation asked me to do. 

Mind you when I filed, I started getting death threats and letters in the mail saying “we’re watching you” Facebook accounts harassing me continuously, dozens of phone calls at all hours of the night from spoofed numbers. 

I’d say at this point it’s slander/libel and it’s really malicious especially since they had the email asking me to leave them be, I did what they asked and they’re gaslighting me over that too.

137,1cruts7,WIBTA if I changed my mind and didn't split the cost of movers with my roommate?,"I lived with my current roommate for two years. Since she hasn't had much experience living on her own  I made a comment to keep in mind when getting furniture that everything that is brought in will eventually come out. We live in densely populated city where rent increases often make people move after a few years. We were fortunate enough to have family close to help move our stuff in. She had a uhaul for her stuff and family to physically move stuff in. I had family members with a large enough car to tie a mattress to. Along with a couple chairs and a small dining table, my roommates family brought a very heavy sofa for the living room, that cannot be dismantled. I'm actually surprised they managed it on their own as I can't even lift it myself. However this time around, both of us were likely be on our own when moving. I'm planning on renting a uhaul as my car cannot fit everything.

I agreed that it makes sense to split the cost because we both benefited from the sofa. We ended up not moving so it never became an issue. However now she is moving to a different apartment about 30 min over when our lease is over in 6 months (she has changed jobs so she wants to be closer to it and I'm going to a different apartment building in the same city). We will be moving out the same day. If I was on my own, I wouldn't hire a mover, just get a uhaul and some moving materials as the furniture I personally own is very light.

While yes, I benefit from the furniture (also a dining table), it doesn't make financial sense to hire the same mover. I could also apply that logic to the TV and tv stand that I brought, but that would be an unfair comparision to be fair to her, as that is something that is very light and can be moved by myself. The fact that we will no longer be roommates make me think it would be unreasonable for her to expect me to split. We would be paying for the mover to put her stuff in a uhaul, drive to the other town, unload, come back, get my stuff and drive to another apartment. When we were thinking about not renewing our lease and moving together to another apartment due to a rent increase, I had estimates for movers over $1000, and that was for a few miles. For the amount we would save on rent, it wasn't worth it so we stayed. I can't imagine how much it'll be with two destinations.

Also, my roommate has a disability that makes it impossible for her to move most furniture by herself. She has no choice but to have help, while I just need a uhaul. So I feel like I'm going back on my word that yes we benefit from the sofa so it makes sense for us to share the financial burden.

So TL;DR AITA for changing my mind about splitting the cost of a mover, which means she will hire her own mover and I'll be responsible only for my stuff?

Edit: Something to add that might make the case for her side: I also said I would look into renting a furniture mover, **after** she already took the new job. I was not thinking about how nonsensical it would be do that since we aren't going to the same place. I should have realized earlier that it wasn't my responsibility instead of saying that.

My relationship with my father was never that great to be honest, I've been constantly avoiding him since a very young age, he is kind but an awful listener which led me to avoid talking to him many times

Back to my high school days, around the time I was almost 18 my dad insisted in bringing me on his retail job, he's somewhat successful and his business has been growing for a while. Being the grumpy teenager and the bad relationships I kept refusing the job, but since I was still young and manipulatable he eventually managed to bring me there. I showed my frustration everyday until he got sick of me and stopped bringing me there, I was happy with the outcome and didn't complain any further

This happened one or two more times in the later months, I did go to college but I had no job yet. Until eventually I got lucky with something online I did and it started paying off and becoming my new job. Keep in mind this new job of mine is not considered a real job among the boomer generation. Think of it as an artist job or who paints images or makes music, something people would do as a hobby but mine got enough attention to pay for my life

Months passed, the job had many ups and downs and one day I did manage to reach some insane heights I never thought I would, my job grew massively. Unfortunately my passion took a hit, I became severely depressed and stopped doing the job. My past work is still paying off even until today but it's been going downhill ever since, I've been trying to refresh it and start over every once in a while but I'm really struggling, I can't keep myself doing it for a long period of time

Now this whole time my dad has been hinting at me that he really wants me to start working with him, I always refused because I saw it as a pity job and I didn't even like the job, I'm self employed and would like to remain like that for as long as I can

Today he came home and told me to help him with this new company. He wants me to manage it and run the whole thing. I once again refused, I never asked for a job, I already have my own and as soon as I put effort into it like before it'll surpass any job I could ever have in this rotten country.

They're mad now, I'm afraid they might be able to finally guilt trip and convince me to do the job, I've been living a really lazy life for the past few years, I get that they're trying to push me back on track and live my life but this has been the red line for me since ever.

Also, I refer to her by first name to my siblings or as “your mum” which she caught wind of so I think this made her dig her heels in.

I have always done everything for my father, he hasn’t worked in my lifetime and I’ve supported him soon as I left school, I haven’t had much of a life, very few friends, no girlfriends because he always dictated what I had to do, always had jobs for me to do, always had things for me to pay for and if there were no tasks he would just bully me about being worthless.

145,1crtrjj,AITA for not facilitating a visit from my wife's friend?,"(Names have been changed.  If it matters, everyone involved is in their 40s.)

My wife Debbie has a friend, Patty, whom she's known for many years and lives in Washington DC (we live in Minnesota).  Patty and her husband just had her first baby last year (her husband has kids from a previous marriage) and apparently she's been having a hard time.  My wife talks with Patty often and I always know it's her because these phone calls pretty much consist of my wife listening to Patty complain about her life for 45+ minutes each call.  Nothing against Patty as from what my wife's told me Patty's situation and marriage doesn't seem very great; my impression is her husband is, at the very least, disrespectful toward her.  Here's some of the snippets of what my wife's told me:

* The first story I heard was when Patty and her husband went on a cruise for their honeymoon.  In addition to the two of them, he paid for his two daughters *and his ex-wife* to join them.  I guess he told Patty that with his ex-wife there as well she'd be able to look after his daughters.

* Since she's had the baby she had to quit her job and is feeling very isolated and alone.  She doesn't drive and my impression is that her husband hasn't been supportive of her getting out of the house.  I also don't think pulls his weight in keeping up the household.

* Patty and her son are going to visit her home country (same country my wife's from) in a few days, which I'm sure will make her feel better.  While she's in her country, her husband's flying to France with one of his daughters and his ex-wife.  Though I'm not sure if she's paying her own way this time. 

My wife visited Patty and her husband in DC this last Christmas break; I stayed home since my wife and I are planning to visit her country together (hopefully this summer!) so I need to save my PTO.  My wife suggested that Patty visit us to sometime to get out of her house.

**Here's where I may be the asshole.**  Apparently, Patty's husband told her she can't come to visit us because he hasn't met me; he told her he needs to make sure I'm a ""good guy"" before he lets her visit.  So my wife asked if I'd be willing to fly out to DC sometime after our trip to her country to meet them so he could meet me and give Patty his blessing to visit.  I told my wife no, I'm not going to fly to DC just so this fucking guy, who gallivants around the world with his ex-wife, can fucking audit **me**.  My wife said it wouldn't *just* to meet him; we could make a vacation of it.  That much is true, and normally I'd have no problem spending a day or half a day meeting up with her friends while we're on a vacation, but the thought of meeting Patty's husband just so he can judge me is insulting.

146,1crtq5w,AITA for Refusing to Pee Sitting Down?  ,"My girlfriend (28F) and I (33M) are currently on vacation, staying in the same hotel room. This morning, while she was in the bathroom, I came in to pee. When she saw me, she expressed her frustration about finding pee on the toilet, which, admittedly, I am sometimes guilty of when I pee in the middle of the night. I apologized and offered to make sure I clean up after I pee or in the morning when I wake up.

However, she was livid and insisted that I need to pee sitting down because the toilet would still be dirty otherwise. It was early, and I didn’t want to keep arguing, so I sat down to pee in front of her. Despite this, she continued to raise her voice at me, and admittedly, I got defensive, leading to a shouting match.

This isn’t the first time she’s blown up on me for something small. For example, the other night, she got up to go to the bathroom and woke me up. After she came back to bed, I was moving around trying to get comfortable because I couldn’t fall asleep, and she got super angry, yelling at me to not move at all. Every time I made a slight movement, she would passively aggressively sigh or just tell me to stop.

AITA here, or should I be more accommodating to my girlfriend's demands?

Edit just so we are clear I always lift the toilet seat up and have never peed on that just the rim of the toilet when the seat is lifted.

I looked at the parents and they weren't paying attention, so I called out ""Hey. No."".

I don't think I yelled it, but I know my tone was ""Stop scratching my car, kid."".

This week when we arrive he gets in the car eating strawberry cookies (it was lunch time, and I had prepared actual food as I always do when he will come over) so I knew lunch was already spoiled, and then he announces that his mom bought it for him when she took him to buy cigarettes, and that he loved strawberry as much as she loved smoking. Through the day he repeated that fact for others, and at one point when he was telling that to his cousin I couldn’t watch it anymore, I told him that smoking was really bad, that it’s not a nice thing to do and that it damages your health. And me and his cousin made him agree that cigarettes smell bad. My SO wasn’t close to me when this happened but I told him what I had done and he agreed with me. Cut to today and my stepsons grandma is messaging my SO and she’s very angry at me for breaking the news about smoking for him because now he’s getting upset whenever he sees his mom and grandpa smoking, and that he’s too little to know those things.
Also just to note that I didn’t go overboard talking about cancer or death, no pictures of smoking damage whatsoever, I literally just said it wasn’t good for you and that it will make you sick, I think my explanation was age appropriate. So, AITA?",0.0,1.0592608451843262,1,0

My younger sister asked to use it since she was going through a separation and couldn’t afford her car note any more so she needed to get rid of her car.

I told her she could use my car but she had to pay the insurance on it, the yearly registration, and the maintenance (i.e oil changes etc.)

153,1crtal8,AITA for kinda disliking my cousin because of what she has done to me in the past?,"Okay so I (15f) kinda dislike my cousin (17f) who we'll call Willow, because of what shes done to me in the past.

When we were kids (think like 7 and 9) she and i would always race with me to get the best spot at the lunch table. No big deal. Until she started shouting at me for being faster than her and getting to sit in that spot. She scared me a lot.

She also forced me to watch shows, that i'm pretty sure were for 16+ audiences, where there were cops and ambulanced and everything that comes with hospitals (i cant really say anything too specific because of the the rules)

She wouldnt let me out of the room until the episode was finished. I remember at one point just breaking down crying because the ambulance series horrified me.

The breaking point came when I was maybe 9 and she 11-12. It was someones birthday and we where all at her house. We kids decided to go play hide and seek. So it was me, Willow, her brother,her friend and two other kids. all of them ranging from the ages 11-16.

They took me to the courtyard of an old church and told me to go and hide while laughing about something. So i did that, but when after maybe half an hour it was getting darker and darker and i couldnt hear their voices anymore, i started getting scared. I went out of my hiding spot and sure enough: nobody was there anymore.

Now picture this: a scared, almost hysterical, 9-year-old in the courtyard of a church where we weren't even allowed to be, with no phone, only a basic idea about where i was and it was already quite dark. I've since gone back to the church and turns out we really were trespassing.

They actually abandoned me there. Now i realise that they were laughing about me trusting them not to abandon me.

I somehow found my way to the main road from which i knew the way back to Willows house. But it still took me maybe half an hour, in which it was now completely dark.

When i got back the adults were surprised to see me back alone. They questioned me where the others were but i just lied and told them they'd dropped me off before going off to the next playground. I was already terrified of what would happen when they returned home and saw me there. I really didn't wanna get into more trouble with Willow than necessary.

Fortunatly we left before the others returned and that was the end of that story. No one mentioned anything about that night ever again. I hope i gave them a good scare when they realised i was nowhere to be found in the courtyard.

Now i often simply refuse to speak to her more than i have to. My mother is very confused about this and says i should let go of the past (she knows about the outbursts and shows) but whenever i look at her i see the bully she used to be. Mother says i have no reason to dislike her because she was still a child who didnt know better. I think i might be in the wrong because i cant let go of something that happened over 7 years ago

154,1crt67o,AITA for yelling at my mother after she berated me for doing something she does all the time?,"So, My mother (54) and I (15f) got into an argument earlier today about me not hearing her yelling my name.

Background info: I really like listening to music, although never particularly loud, and the door to my room is always closed, no matter whats happening because i dont like people being able to stare into my room. Also my room is one entire floor above the rest of the flat where we live.

My mother yelled my name earlier and I didn't hear it because of course i was listening to music and playing a video game and all the doors were closed. She came in a few minutes later screaming at me for never listening to her. She also blamed my phone for distracting me.

This pissed me off, because i almost always hear her when shes calling and this has only happened maybe five times. Usually i can hear that someones screaming and quickly turn off the music and am able to answer her in time, but sometimes im just too interested in whatever is happening in the game that i just dont hear it.

But my mother often ignores me or doesnt hear me when im standing right next to her. This happens like twice a day, sometimes even more because she's distracted by her own phone. in instances like this, its like i dont exist, i could be screaming right into her ear and she wouldnt notice.

This is where i might have been the AH, because i yelled at her that she should fix her own problem with hearing before she starts screaming an me and that she had no right to yell at me for this when she herself isn't any better.

Now she's refusing to talk to me and almost didn't make any lunch for me had it not been for my father insisting.

I understand that i, too, should maybe keep my door open so that i can hear her better. but i just dont feel comfortable with this, becuase it takes away my privacy and the closed door makes me feel safe in my own room. with it open this wouldn't be the case anymore and i'd be constantly anxious and looking over my shoulder at the door.

It takes over 5 hours to drive there and it’s in somewhat of a remote location so transportation via train/bus/plane would take about twice as long due to lack of direct route/transfers/etc. I’m happy for her because she’s excited about the internship and is going to be staying with her aunt who lives in that area, close to the company where she’ll be working. On the other hand, I’m disappointed because it’s going to be tough to visit her. I’m about to start a new job, and I expect to be working about 60+ hours a week, with the need to study and prepare for an important professional exam on the weekends and during my time outside of work. Because of my work schedule, the most time that I’d be able to spend visiting her would be only over a weekend (Fri night-Sun). Driving 5+ hours both ways while having to spend a good portion of the day on Sat & Sun studying seems like it would leave only a little bit of time for us to actually spend time with and hang out for each other. My girlfriend had the option of doing the internship at a location close-by (in the same city/general area) that we both live in, but decided that it would be fun to do it somewhere new and spend the summer staying with her aunt.

156,1crsgk2,AITA for moving other people’s stuff at school?,"I 17M attend a sixth form (school for 16-18) in the U.K. Sixth form is Year 12 and Year 13, I don’t know what that will translate to in the US or other places.

Normally, Year 13s are allowed access to the Year Group Common Room and Silent Study Room during their Studies. Year 12s however are only allowed in Silent Study Rooms. Because Year 13s are doing exams at the moment, their regular timetables have been suspended. I am in Year 12 so I have been mostly unaffected by this but the normal Silent Study Room has been converted into the examination room so spare classrooms are now used as substitute for what would be ‘Silent Study’. 

Today, I had no lessons so I went to ‘Silent Study’ and we were told that one supervisor wasn’t in and they couldn’t find a sub so we’d have to work without supervision. A while later, a person who I’ve had issues with (we’ll call him Bob) came in with friends and sat behind me. Bob and his friends are Year 13. They said they’re ‘revising’ but were making noise by laughing, slamming tables and at one point, flung Bob’s pencil case into my back. 

There was also another group who was making noise. These boys are in my year and they’ve always been loud. In the past when we had classes, I remember them making noise and no matter how many talkings to they get, they don’t listen. Because I knew they wouldn’t listen, I left the room to get our head of year and asked them to deal with them.

When I got back, I asked Bob and his friends to be quieter but they only got louder and louder and they tried to deflect attention to the other group.

Break time came. As they got their lunch, I moved their things to a table on the other side of the room. 

When they came back, they began to shout at me saying that I singled them out because I don’t like Bob and it was never about the noise. One person in the group (we’ll call her Kayla) said sorry for making noise and then went on to ask me to apologise for moving their stuff to a new area. Another person (we’ll call her Sarah) said that she didn’t feel comfortable moving her things. I said to her I didn’t feel comfortable being hit by a pencil case.

Bob then began getting into my space and kept touching my shoulder while stood over me and started saying to me that I had every opportunity to move myself but I didn’t. I may have begrudgingly done but during the Study Period, there were no seats available and while they did come free during break, giving me a chance to move and I am a firm believer that I shouldn’t have to move my work around to convenience the ones causing a disruption.

They then turned to me again and asked why I didn’t do anything about the other group. Like I said before, I had actually informed a member of staff but to be honest, how I deal with other people was not their business so I made up some fake excuse as to why I ‘didn’t’. 

I can’t help but feel like I went about this the wrong way? Maybe I did let my past bad experiences with Bob affect my decision making.

She loves her stepkids and even before this she was trying to be a second mom to the children but weren't warming up to her fast and Emily was upset about that already. She told me it was extra devastating knowing she wouldn't have biological children. She told me she was going to do everything she could to win their hearts.

I'll be honest, it hasn't been going good. Emily is no closer to Caine or Kaia and Emily told me the kids even deny she's part of their family to other people and that it hurt her. So when she told me that she was being celebrated on Mother's Day this year and she was getting gifts and cards from the kids I was a little surprised. 

On Sunday the kids are visibly angry when they arrived at my parents house. BIL kept whispering to them and they were glaring at him. Emily looked so excited though. When we sat down for lunch my BIL gave Emily handmade cards and the kids flipped out and snatched them out of Emily's hands before she could even open them. They started yelling that those were for their mom and not Emily. Emily asked them about cards for her and they said they got her nothing. She asked why make the cards for their late mother and not her. BIL chimed in and said he had some for her. The kids asked why and BIL said because Emily does so much for them and she's taken over as mom. Emily added in after him that she couldn't be luckier with the kids she got either. The kids anger got much worse and they started singing/chanting that she's not their mom, they don't want her, they don't love her, they don't care about her and it was repeated over and over again. Emily was crying. BIL was comforting her and I suggested to him that maybe he could take the kids home. My parents were comforting Emily and BIL did in fact take the kids home.

It was several hours after and my parents were calling the kids evil, nasty, disgusting, little shits, rotten, saying they should be put in an old school orphanage where nobody wants them. Just all kinds of awful things. And I know the kids hurt Emily and acted out badly. But I don't think being so awful about literal children is good. I told them as much. Emily told me they were just defending her. I told her that their comments about the kids won't help her or fix things for her. My parents said I should hate the kids just as much as they do for what they did to my sister. And the fact I spoke up is still bothering them because I got texts from them and Emily about it afterward.

160,1crqu4k,AITA for kicking my friend out of my book club?,"I know this sounds childish, but I'm having a hard time figuring it out anyway. My friend Julie and I have been having problems in our friendship for a while. For background information: we've been friends since 2020 and at first it was a normal friendship, but then she became increasingly demanding and needy, and jealous of my other friendships. That was weird to me because we're both adults (late 20s) and her behavior screamed middle school to me. I tried talking to her about this and she seemed to understand and we moved on. Then she started being inappropriate to my other friends (for example, she started hitting on one of my best friend's sister in their house, knowing the sister was in a relationship) so I had to stop inviting her to do things with my friend group. I still would hang out with her, but when it was just us. 

She would go out to have a meal with me and expect me to pay, sometimes saying she forgot her wallet, saying she would pay me back but never doing it. She would say she'd meet me at a certain time, only to arrive 2-3 hours later or sometimes she would not arrive at all. But at the same time she'd be angry when I spend time with my other friends or boyfriend.

The last straw was when she insisted I go with her to a costume party with this group of people I didn't know (she met them once before). The thing was, everyone had to pay a sort of fee and bring something to eat, so I payed it and said I would bring a cake. Julie said she'd help me baking the cake, but on the day of the event she texted me saying she had traveled to the countryside with her new boyfriend, and she couldn't help me with the cake nor go to the party. I am an introvert and she knows it, I'm not the type to go to parties where I know no one, but I decided to go because I had already payed for it. But after that, I decided to stop talking to Julie.

The thing is, I have a book club with a few friends and Julie was part of it since the beginning. We have a rule that says that if you do not participate in three meetings consecutively you're out (to make space for other people that want to participate). Julie had said she would come for the last three meetings, but never showed up, so I decided to kick her out of the club. She begged to stay, saying she was having mental health problems and that the book club was the one thing keeping her sane. I said I was sorry to hear that, but I didn't see how the book club was helping, seeing she never read the books or went to the meetings, and kicked her out anyway.

Am I being unreasonable? So mother's day I wake up at 630am and my husband jumps out of bed and tells me to stay put. 
He comes back in with my 2 kids and some mother's day gift. I was so happy and appreciated the effort. Both kids had sport starting from 830am so I got up and made everyone breakfast. We head out the door and take the kids to their activities which finish at 11am.

My husband says we need to get my son football boots and afterwards we'll do lunch. When we got to tbe place he  intended to take me to we found it had been permanently closed for some time. He asked what I wanted to do and I said I didnt know and was tired of always making the decisions, so his back up plan was lunch at the shopping centre food court. This made me really upset mainly because I usually don't expect anything for mother's day and this has worked well for me but in the lead up to this years mothers day, I got my hopes up. 2 weeks prior my sister had asked if I would like to do a mother's day picnic, when I mentioned this to him he said that it was my mother's day too and what if he and my kids wanted to take me out to lunch. With this I told my sister he intended on taking me out for lunch- thinking it was something he had already planned  or organised. The night before mother's day we were at my MILs house and she also said he planned taking me out for lunch- again I assumed he made plans.

When we got home I went and sat on my bed as I knew I would go straight back to cleaning and making dinner for everyone. I came out of the room at 6pm to see what he had planned for dinner and found he was waiting for me to make the decision as to what we were having (although he intended to make it- heating chicken in the air fryer and making a wrap). 

Later that night he asked why I had been upset all day and I said it was because the lack of effort made me feel disappointed especially because I could of planned a day with my sister. His reply was that the Saturday he intended to do everything we ended up being really busy but managed to get me presents. I reminded him that I was visiting a friend in hospital and he was free from 1pm onwards. I had asked if he was the one to make breakfast on fathers day and we go for a food court lunch would he be happy and he said yes. Am I being unreasonable?

but  every time  i do that, he gets really sad for the rest of the day. and he always feels like hes a horrible person for snoring despite me telling him that its something that he cannot control, and i dont consider him an awful person at all. i still love him even if i dont want to listen to his snoring.

admittedly, i do not wish to sit in call and have his snoring fill up my entire headsets (if im on the computer). he snores very loudly, and it often overpowers any games or music that im playing. even at maximum volume. turning it down to the point where i can barely hear it is what i do. but when he wakes up and finds out that i cant hear him, he gets very upset and says it makes him depressed.

ive also told him that i put my phone off of speaker mode if im calling him on my bed so that the snoring doesnt wake me up. which is has multiple times because ive tried putting it on speakers. his response was “if you snored i wouldve listened to it”. which is cool, but just because we’re a couple it doesnt mean we have to be the same at everything we do. i told him that im me and hes him. i dont want to listen to loud snoring. 

its starting to drive me crazy. because im a night owl and i do my work at night. along with gaming sessions. night time is peaceful for me and forcing myself to listen to his snoring is ruining it for me. its so. loud.

164,1crqbjv,AITA for not inviting my cousins to my wedding?,"My fiancé (m27) and I (F25) got engaged in October of last year. Our wedding is August of this year. We have always planned on having a small wedding as we are paying for everything ourselves. We also want our wedding to be child free so everyone can relax for the day and because we have a lot of cousins and friends with kids so inviting everyone would increase the head count significantly. 

We discussed who we wanted to marry us pretty early into planning and decided it would be nice if my aunt/godmother (f42) would do it, because she made me her maid of honor when I was younger because I was there with her and helped her through her through her cancer treatment. She was ecstatic when we asked her and said yes. 

For context, I was very close with my aunt and grandparents on this side of the family growing up. We have drifted apart in recent years since me and my fiancé began dating and I moved out of my parents house at 18 with him. They wrote me letters openly expressing that they were unsupportive off my relationship when I moved out and stated that they “didn’t raise me to be like this”  (they didn’t raise me) but we have moved past it in the past few years and started seeing them a bit more (usually once a year at Christmas.)

Anyways, after I sent the save the dates, ( my aunts was addressed to just her and my uncle and not their children since it is a child free event) my aunt texted me asking if her kids were invited. I responded “No, unfortunately, our wedding is going to be child free. I’m sorry!”


Immediately I got a call from my grandmother asking “why I’m doing this to our family.” I tell her our wedding is child free, my intention isn’t to hurt or target anyone. Basically tells me I need to stop being selfish and they won’t be able to come to my wedding because they won’t be able to find childcare. I told her I really hope they’ll be able to find childcare in the next 10 months because I would love for them to be there. 

After I got off the phone with her, I texted my aunt apologizing for hurting her or the kids, explaining again that there are going to be no children at the event, and it had nothing to do with them in particular. I didn’t hear back. 

I followed up with her 2 more times asking if she still was going to come to the wedding and marry us and I never heard back. I followed up a month later to let her know that because I never heard from her I found someone else to marry us. She called me a few hours later, but I wasn’t able to answer the phone. I sent a text  saying we can talk on Saturday. I forgot to call her and she never reached out to me. We have not spoke at all since then.

I sent out my wedding invitations this week and my aunt RSVPed and declined their invitation. She also texted my mom and told her she isn’t coming to my wedding shower. I think it’s totally reasonable to have a child free wedding and to be selfish with who we invite. But maybe I’m missing something? Am I in the wrong for this?

166,1crq8t4,AITA for telling 3 of my 4 siblings that they should be more understanding of our oldest sister and thanking her instead of treating her like shit for not celebrating our mother for Mother's Day?,"I (22m) am the youngest of my siblings. My oldest sister Casey (31f) is my hero. She has done so much for me and the rest of our siblings (23f, 25m and 26f) and they never acknowledge it and only talk about Casey being a bitch to our mom or saying she should be pulling her weight more when it comes to mom.

Background on our childhood is probably relevant here: Casey never really had a parent. Our parents were both shitty people and our father was in and out of prison. Our mother was super hard on Casey and treated her like shit. Casey is also the kid who looks most like our father. Our mother was never kind or caring toward Casey but she wanted her to be those things for us, so she pushed our mother to take care of us and would be there in the background trying to make it happen. But Casey was often left doing a lot too. She walked us all to school when we were little, she didn't hang out with friends because she was babysitting or taking care of us. Casey's birthday was forgotten for years and it was pretty much every year until I wrote it down and made sure I brought it up so she'd be celebrated. The rest of our birthdays were celebrated because Casey wrote it down for our mother. She knew it was pointless doing it for herself because our mother hated her.

Casey got a part time job when she was 14 and would help pay for stuff. She saved up to go to prom and spent all the money on us because our mother had none at the time. She didn't go to prom. Instead she worked that night for more money.

I always saw it. My siblings always saw our mother as their hero and would get mad at Casey for fighting with mother. They saw our mother as the greatest. And she treated us better generally than Casey but the only reason she was involved with us was because of Casey.

So for Mother's Day this year my siblings all wanted to do this big celebration of our mother because she was diagnosed with chronic liver disease and they fear she won't be around much longer. Casey wanted no part in it. My other siblings were pissed. I told them Casey owed our mother nothing and they fought with me. It was a huge deal and when Casey didn't show up on Mother's Day it set them off. I wasn't there either and I chose to go to Casey's and celebrate with her and my BIL and their kids. My other siblings were being so shitty to Casey in our group chat so I told them they should be more understanding after all Casey had done for us, and I listed examples, and given the fact our mother treated her like shit, and I listed examples. I told them Casey was more deserving of our Mother's Day celebrations and not mother.

They called me a bad son and a bad brother and said I was sick just like Casey.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-14,"AITA for telling 3 of my 4 siblings that they should be more understanding of our oldest sister and thanking her instead of treating her like shit for not celebrating our mother for Mother's Day? I (22m) am the youngest of my siblings. My oldest sister Casey (31f) is my hero. She has done so much for me and the rest of our siblings (23f, 25m and 26f) and they never acknowledge it and only talk about Casey being a bitch to our mom or saying she should be pulling her weight more when it comes to mom.

Background on our childhood is probably relevant here: Casey never really had a parent. Our parents were both shitty people and our father was in and out of prison. Our mother was super hard on Casey and treated her like shit. Casey is also the kid who looks most like our father. Our mother was never kind or caring toward Casey but she wanted her to be those things for us, so she pushed our mother to take care of us and would be there in the background trying to make it happen. But Casey was often left doing a lot too. She walked us all to school when we were little, she didn't hang out with friends because she was babysitting or taking care of us. Casey's birthday was forgotten for years and it was pretty much every year until I wrote it down and made sure I brought it up so she'd be celebrated. The rest of our birthdays were celebrated because Casey wrote it down for our mother. She knew it was pointless doing it for herself because our mother hated her.

Casey got a part time job when she was 14 and would help pay for stuff. She saved up to go to prom and spent all the money on us because our mother had none at the time. She didn't go to prom. Instead she worked that night for more money.

I always saw it. My siblings always saw our mother as their hero and would get mad at Casey for fighting with mother. They saw our mother as the greatest. And she treated us better generally than Casey but the only reason she was involved with us was because of Casey.

So for Mother's Day this year my siblings all wanted to do this big celebration of our mother because she was diagnosed with chronic liver disease and they fear she won't be around much longer. Casey wanted no part in it. My other siblings were pissed. I told them Casey owed our mother nothing and they fought with me. It was a huge deal and when Casey didn't show up on Mother's Day it set them off. I wasn't there either and I chose to go to Casey's and celebrate with her and my BIL and their kids.

167,1crpze6,AITA for not socializing with the strangers in our house ?,"One day my dad brought a man home and told me he was going to stay until he found a house for himself. He didn’t know him but apparently the man just arrived in the country and my dad said he thinks he’s a good person so he would let him stay in our guest room for 300€ a month (though I don’t think he’s paying him). At first I thought it was just the man but one day I woke up, went to the kitchen and his wife was there. Making eggs. Later on my dad told me she was his wife and she too will be staying with us. 

I don’t really mind because I always stay in my room, I don’t like people let alone talking to them but every time I’ve encountered both I’ve always been polite. They ask me for help with their legal documents, jobs, creating accounts etc I help them then go on about my day. I don’t really care. One thing I’ve realized though is our food supply has been running out quick. Especially the eggs. My dad goes to work very early and I’m the one who does the groceries. Apparently every morning they fry like 4-5 eggs for breakfast. 

I was shocked when I realized that because I couldn’t do that in another person house. 4 eggs for breakfast every day ?? And they don’t pay for it either. My dad’s the one who always gives me money to rebuy the eggs. He doesn’t know how it finishes he just knows his « friends » eats them. I’m ngl that annoys me and I don’t like them. I don’t like people in general I’m introverted and a bit antisocial but I’m not disrespectful or anything towards them. 

Not to mention there has been a lot of changes in the kitchen, sometimes I can’t cook when I want to because the wife is cooking. I’m allergic to beef and eating it swollen my mouth and tongue. Idk how but I got an allergic reaction last week though I told them both I was allergic to beef and many other things ( I use my own stuff to cook but idk how I came in contact with the beef). 

Anyway today the wife called me and basically told me that I was scarring her. That I don’t come out of my room to talk with them, I should be more cool is what she said. (I did told them I like staying in my room, I don’t watch TV and I don’t eat breakfast). (I have an autoimmune disease so there’s a lot of things I do or don’t do). She told me I wasn’t welcoming to them and that when I cook my food I take it with me to my room and that’s disrespectful. I just nodded and continued what I was doing. It really doesn’t have anything to do with them, I always take my food to my room because again I’m sick and I have a lot of allergies. I was doing it way back before they came here. I just needed to vent and ask for advice because I feel like I’m going to explode. I’ve compromised A LOT since they came here and apparently that’s not enough ? Idk what else to do.

169,1crptl4,AITA for cooking broccoli?,"Going to give some context. I guess it's a pretty benign issue but I need some outside perspective.

I (26NB) live with my friend (47m). He owns the flat, we get on well, have lived together since last July, and are pretty considerate of each other. I have OCD, he thinks he has undiagnosed ADHD. I have to agree that he has a form of neurodivergence. 

I am a very considerate housemate. I never complained about discomfort I felt when there’d be people in the flat, or he'd be practising performances with people and it’d be awkward for me to make food or feel I can't relax. I never complain about the smell of meat and other animal products that make me feel sick, or about stuff in the dishwasher with animal fat on. Yes I'm vegan. Because at the end of the day he lives there and is entitled to do and eat what he wants. I have to really override my OCD, but I like to be as considerate as possible. 

Mentally he isn't in the best place, and I think it's making stuff between us very stressful, because everything is starting to frustrate him. 

Recently, it's become an issue that I have my partners over regularly. Mostly because he knows they're in the flat, despite being very quiet and in my room. He's started having issues with various things, which has become a difficult balancing act for me. I'm constantly walking on eggshells.

Last month he said he thinks he has an allergic reaction to me cooking broccoli. He thinks charring it makes his lungs funny. I said I'd try to cook it less or when he isn't home. He never told me I couldn't cook it. Also broccoli has been something I've cooked ever since I've lived here, and it's only now a problem. I think this is some confirmation bias bs. 

Yesterday I was cooking broccoli as it needed eating. He came into the kitchen and asked if I'm going to char it, I said no I'm just trying to soften it. I then mentioned how you can't be allergic to broccoli when it's cooking. I said it could be something else if it's making his lungs funny. He said something about not liking the smell then left the room.

A few mins later he came back angry and said ""I've googled it, you can be allergic to broccoli, it's rare but you can be.” I said I never said he wasn't, just it doesn't release proteins when you cook it so you can't have an allergic reaction. He said ""I don't like that you've decided this for me. I don't like the smell, it makes me feel sick, and I don't think it's unreasonable for me to ask you not cook it when I'm home. Is that okay?"" He wasn't asking nicely. I don't think he's allergic to it, he drinks premade drinks that are 14% broccoli nearly every day. If he was allergic I think he'd know, unless it's very mild.

It went from ""it makes my lungs funny"" to ""it makes me feel sick"" after I pointed out he can't have an allergic reaction. I just think he's letting his own mental health situation get the better of everything right now and I don't think that's fair on me.

I moved in almost 3 years ago, and my neighbor often knocks on my door. There were small trees in my garden at first, and she was frustrated by the amount of leaves blowing over onto her ""patio"" (unsure of the term), which she always keeps perfectly clean. I was going to remove those trees anyway so no problem there. She also regularly asks me to pull the weeds growing along and through the wire fence separating us. I've just started doing that routinely at this point, it's just 10-15 minutes of work. She's also asked me to clear the snow in front of her building since it's legally required to do for your own residence, and she supposedly can't due to her age. I never mind doing her those little favors.

Last weekend I planted some new grass and a sprinkler system for it. Unfortunately the very first time I used it, I forgot to turn it off. It ran for about 4 hours, leaving big puddles in my garden and another one in her concrete patio, though most of the water was still contained in the small ditch on the sideline of her property.

At the time I'd just woken up and was still finding my bearings while she got angry at me. I apologized multiple times, and agreed to get rid of the water in her ditch after she demanded it was cleaned up by the end of the day.

174,1crp87l,AITA for making my family open my door? ,"Throwaway for privacy, I'll try to be as transparent as possible because it's plain bizarre and is upsetting me. 

I'm 34F.  For years my rule for my house has been ""knock, and then come in"". I have that in place for two reasons: 
1. My house is a weird sound trap. Unless I am sat on the sofa in the living room, I cannot hear people knocking. It has become a source of humour for my parcel guy because whenever I order something I include the delivery instruction ""bang on the door like it slagged off your mum"". He thinks it's hysterical. 
2. I have AuDHD. This means thatI massively struggle with task-switching. If I am loading the dishwasher and someone knocks on the door, it can take me all day to get back to where I was in my day or routine (if at all). I also work from home, this means that I could be interrupting important / time-sensitive tasks. Having people knock & let themselves in means that I can complete whatever I'm focusing on, which is much less stressful for me. 

This has been a longstanding rule that has not caused any drama up until now. My sister (32F) has decided that this rule does not apply to her - she will knock and stand at the door. My shouting ""it's open"" or saying ""just come in"" does nothing, nor does my explaining why I have the rule. I am baffled as to why this is a problem, she has let herself in in the past, & shes why I have this rule in place (shes twice screamed in my face because I ""left her on the doorstep"" & was ""ignoring her""). 

Sunday I messaged & asked if she wanted to come over Monday. ""OK I might, depends how tired I am. Think I'm ill :("". I sad-react, & don't hear from her. 11am Monday there's a knock at the door. I am mid-discussion with managers on Teams, I say ""hang on, someone at my door"", & pop them on mute. It's my sister. She says hi, marches into my living room, I say ""why did you not just let yourself in?"", & she begins screaming at me that she's ""not having this argument"" with me, that she's ""too sick to deal with this shit"".

Am I the AH?? At this point I have no clue. I'm not great at enforcing boundaries, but I feel like I can't let this go.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-14,"AITA for making my family open my door?  Throwaway for privacy, I'll try to be as transparent as possible because it's plain bizarre and is upsetting me. 

I'm 34F.  For years my rule for my house has been ""knock, and then come in"". I have that in place for two reasons: 
1. My house is a weird sound trap. Unless I am sat on the sofa in the living room, I cannot hear people knocking. It has become a source of humour for my parcel guy because whenever I order something I include the delivery instruction ""bang on the door like it slagged off your mum"". He thinks it's hysterical. 
2. I have AuDHD. This means thatI massively struggle with task-switching. If I am loading the dishwasher and someone knocks on the door, it can take me all day to get back to where I was in my day or routine (if at all). I also work from home, this means that I could be interrupting important / time-sensitive tasks. Having people knock & let themselves in means that I can complete whatever I'm focusing on, which is much less stressful for me. 

This has been a longstanding rule that has not caused any drama up until now. My sister (32F) has decided that this rule does not apply to her - she will knock and stand at the door. My shouting ""it's open"" or saying ""just come in"" does nothing, nor does my explaining why I have the rule. I am baffled as to why this is a problem, she has let herself in in the past, & shes why I have this rule in place (shes twice screamed in my face because I ""left her on the doorstep"" & was ""ignoring her""). 

Sunday I messaged & asked if she wanted to come over Monday. ""OK I might, depends how tired I am. Think I'm ill :("". I sad-react, & don't hear from her. 11am Monday there's a knock at the door. I am mid-discussion with managers on Teams, I say ""hang on, someone at my door"", & pop them on mute. It's my sister. She says hi, marches into my living room, I say ""why did you not just let yourself in?"", & she begins screaming at me that she's ""not having this argument"" with me, that she's ""too sick to deal with this shit"".

176,1crolrr,AITA for trying to tell my parents that I'm not a kid they can control anymore?,"I am 19, I work a pretty decent job as a video editor whilst also freelancing, and I am in my last year of college majoring in film. 

I had this argument with my mom yesterday regarding her sorta controlling me. I have not had as much work this week so I've had some more free time to go out. Firstly, I asked to go out. This is something I honestly feel like I do not need to do but I do it anyway out of respect I guess? Anyway, I went out and cane back pretty late, like at around 12am-1. On my way back, my mom was blowing up my phone, saying what I was doing out late, asking what I was doing so far (I was in DTLA, about 20-30 mins away, she has me on life360), etc. I ignored her since I was eating dinner with my friends, and because I ignored her she kept sending more texts. I came back and she pressed me about it, and honestly I blew up because I was tired of it.

I told her that I'm not a kid, I am an adult that pays my bills, and if I feel like going out, I'll do so. She yelled back at me, and it just turned into a screaming match.

Our living situation is kinda different than most of the people I know. I don't live with them for free, actually we moved to a bigger place together since an apartment in LA for just me is unrealistic for under 2k a month, and I really wanted my own room (We used to live in a small 2 bedroom apartment, and I have 3 siblings, I'd sleep on the couch). We moved into a 3 bedroom house, where we pay 3k a month. I pay them about $1200 a month for rent, and we split any other bills like utilities and such. We moved at the beginning of this year but I am starting to regret it. I am tired of my parents bossing me around, I would understand following all these rules and such If I was under their roof for free with no job, but thats not the case. 

I have no idea what to do. Realistically I dont think I could afford supporting myself in LA (I make like 5-6k a month on average, sometimes I'll have really good months where I make 10k), and I hate living under these strict rules especially when I am contributing to our household.

However she is still a bit cuckoo, my older brother is low contact with my mother after she started treating his kind wife awfully when she found out she was half black, and is thinking of going absolutely no-contact because my mother has been making passive remarks about my to be born niece's possible skin colour. She was even vary of Javier but I am a no-nonsense person and have never let her insult him or hsi family.

But here's where shit hits the fan, after I gave birth I ultimately decided to name my daughter Eloriya, that is not my grandma's name, it's the name of my husband's older sister who died in car accident, it was an awful accident that left my FIL with ptsd and he is now wheelchair bound because his legs don't work.

The reason I named her Eloriya was because when i held my babygirl and I saw her pretty little face the only thing me and quite frankly my husband as well could notice was the uncanny similarity to his sister's baby pictures. My daughter could pass off for her identical twin except she took after my hair colour. 

Now when my mother found out, she lost all crap. She started screaming like a maniac and hurling insults to my husband and his family, mind you we were still in the hosipital and she had come to visit me with my MIL and FIL because i had a risky delivery and had to stay overnight. She started accusing my husband on brainwashing me into this and tried to attack him, and accused my MIL of forcing me to name my daughter after her dead daughter.

I couldn't take it, I was tired after pushing out a dang mini human outta me. I screamed at my mother that not every MIl is like her, who forces her wishes on their DIL's. Her face dropped as my husband and inlaws looked on in shock.. I told her off for being an awful mother and that how she could still see nothing apart from herself and what she wanted, unlike my MIL who has always treated my like the daughter she never had I told her if it went like this ill go no-contact with her and then she can enjoy the mess she made and then told the nurse to drag my mother out who was now crying hysterically.

I'll be honest with you, I didn't think I was the a-hole but the never-ending messages from my mom's side of my family calling me an ungrateful daughter who couldn't understand her mother was trying to protect her and asking me how dare i bring back her past and choose my MIL over her is making me think twice.

180,1crnq2l,AITA my dad never cooks for the family and I tell him off,"So my (30f) dad (61m) never cooks dinner. 
Growing up mum (55f) was home with the 5 kids and dad was often away for work. 
Mum went back to work maybe 15 years ago and worked part time as a nurse- she now works 4 days a week often 10+ hours.
When she gets home from work she if always responsible for dinner as no one else in the house makes an effort to cook.

I don’t live at home anymore but I live not far away and sometimes drop in.
More often than not I do it’s to help mum because she is tired after a long day at the hospital and the last thing she wants to do is cook dinner. It’s not unusual for her to cook dinner for my dad and 2 brothers (18m/24m) and then not eat. 
My dad and I do the same job and are shift workers. We travel for work maybe 3-5 day and then usually have a week or so at home before leaving again. Our time at home we are not required to work. 

Despite being at home all day, he will not prepare dinner. 
Not to say he is doing nothing, he might be mowing the lawn, washing clothes, sorting bills, exercising ect but the time is his own. 

Now I get frustrated because I see it as disrespectful to mum that she should spend the whole day working and then come home and cook for the family. 
Often dad sits on the couch next to the kitchen and watches YouTube or the news while mum prepares dinner.
Nearly everytime I’m asked up for dinner it’s mum and I cooking while he’s on the couch.

I believe that whoever does not have to attend a paying job that day should organise dinner. 
I think it also sets a bad example of acceptable division of labour for my brothers.

I have told dad on multiple occasions that he should take responsibility for some of the meals in the house.
He gets angry and says it’s disrespectful for me to come to his house and tell him he is being disrespectful- despite the fact that I was invited to dinner- which I then end up cooking for him. 

I understand when my parent initially got married they had a more traditional division of labour, but the circumstances in the house have long since changed with 3 of 5 kids moved out and all children 18+ and old enough to fend for themselves.

I’ve offered to teach dad to cook simple meals or try and inspire him to be more involved in the food department but he just laughs it off or is generally disinterested. I should note if we bbq he will grill the meat . Everything else is done by mum 

I think if he were to cook one meal for the family without being asked mum might faint from surprise .

My 24y old brother works mon-weds in an office and gets home around 5 he sometimes cooks and the 19y old barely knows what’s spatula looks like.

Which would be fine if she was actually dating someone… She’s currently single… I love her but to be honest she “dates” the worst type of people and I desperately do not want an unpredictable stranger at my wedding thats just some guy my friend met a week ago.

Like she gets off on doing public sexual acts and not getting caught when she goes out with these gross guys and I do not trust her to behave classy at my wedding when she’s with a “date”

So I gave her an ultimatum, no significant other, no plus one. She thought I was joking and when I said I wasn’t she called me a bitch and told me I wasn’t considering her feelings and that she won’t have a good time at my wedding without a date. And that because she’s the maid of honor that she has to have a date. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here I don’t want to be stressed out on my big day thinking about how a stranger will act.

So no nobody is getting a random plus one. She does not have a name or even a clue who she even wants to bring but still is fighting me to bring someone. She thinks I’ll wait till the very last minute to have her bring someone. 

Yes she’s my very best friend and I love her very much. She’s perfectly fine by herself but becomes a totally different person around her “dates” I just really want her to be there for me and not make the day about getting laid by a stranger at my wedding lol but she feels like she has to for whatever reason.

SHE WILL NOT BE ALONE. She knows my friends AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY also HER parents and both of her sisters will also be there.

Edit x3:
Oh wow I didn’t expect so many comments thanks for your input on both sides. Everyone has good perspectives, I’m not trying to be mean to her though I guess I don’t trust the guys more than I don’t trust her to behave. The guys are always very off putting and I’ve been embarrassed by who she’s brought to meet my friends and family before at different events or outings just for them to be gone the next day. I just don’t want some random to cause drama.
Okay more information wedding is in 2 months I need to send out rsvps SOON. Her maid of honor duty’s are basically just help me pee, do a speech, and plan the bachelorette I will be the one bankrolling everything for the bachelorette that aren’t activities and transportation split among my friends.

She’s perfectly fine by herself but becomes a totally different person around her “dates” I just really want her to be there for me and not make the day about getting laid by a stranger at my wedding lol but she feels like she has to for whatever reason.

Edit again:
SHE WILL NOT BE ALONE. She knows my friends AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY also HER parents and both of her sisters will also be there.

Edit x3:
Oh wow I didn’t expect so many comments thanks for your input on both sides. Everyone has good perspectives, I’m not trying to be mean to her though I guess I don’t trust the guys more than I don’t trust her to behave. The guys are always very off putting and I’ve been embarrassed by who she’s brought to meet my friends and family before at different events or outings just for them to be gone the next day. I just don’t want some random to cause drama.
Okay more information wedding is in 2 months I need to send out rsvps SOON. Her maid of honor duty’s are basically just help me pee, do a speech, and plan the bachelorette I will be the one bankrolling everything for the bachelorette that aren’t activities and transportation split among my friends. I do not expect her to pay for anything without my help. 
Edit again:
MY FIANCÉ ALSO DOES NOT WANT HER TO BRING A STRANGER for these reasons ITS NOT JUST ME. ",0.0,1.0458768606185913,1,0
182,1crnixg,AITA for telling my husband's grandparents that they shouldn't have surprised their grandkids if they wanted their Mother's Day lunch to go better?,"Sunday my husband (25m) and his two siblings (27m and 22f) were planning to spend the day with their maternal side of the family but their paternal grandparents asked if they could do something too. So we arranged a lunch for them to get together. It was an earlier lunch so they could make it in time for the other things they had planned with the maternal side. The thing they were not expecting was their dad and his wife, who they are no contact with, to be there. Their grandparents surprised them with this after we all got there and it was awkward as hell. It was also my 3rd time meeting their dad.

Their dad's wife kept watching them and trying to get their attention. They ignored her. Then she outright asked where her Happy Mother's Day wishes were which they ignored. She asked about gifts and tried to claim the gifts all three brought for their grandmother. BIL told her nothing was for her and why would she ever think they'd get her anything. GFIL tried to calm things down by talking over everyone but it didn't work because their dad's wife just got louder. She started listing off all the gifts she'd received from them when they were kids and living with her and her husband (FIL). SIL told her they weren't ever actually from them and that their dad had bought them and added their names but it was nothing to do with them. Their dad's wife then turned on SIL and blamed her saying she manipulated the boys to feel the same as she did and it was wrong because they were all young enough when their ""birth mother"" died for them to embrace and benefit from a new mother. My husband laughed at that and said SIL was the youngest and only 5 when their mom died and their dad went out to replace her ASAP because he was pathetic and didn't want to raise his own kids. He said she clearly thought SIL was a very very manipulative and intelligent 5 year old to believe that and pointed out she was very quick to always blame SIL for things. BIL added they were never going to accept some random person who came in months after their mom died and attempted to assert her dominance over them as a ""mother"". He said he didn't care if their dad was unfair to her as well because she was downright evil to try and replace their mom. It got so heated that I suggested to my husband that we just move on.

Later that night my husband's grandparents called me to apologize and said they had no idea how things went so wrong. This is where I might be TA because I told them they shouldn't have surprised their grandkids by inviting FIL and his wife like that if they wanted the lunch to go better. I told his grandparents that they know my husband and his siblings are no contact and no love for their dad or his wife and they know they used to fight all the time. His grandparents told me it shouldn't need to be a surprise and I should understand their POV better. They also told me it's rude to rub it in after they apologized to me.

Some of his gifts that we got him were RGB lighting strips that he could put up around his room, a smart bulb, a few other RGB lighting things for his computer desk and an Alexa so he could control them all through his voice. He absolutely loved it and immediately went to work setting everything up.

Yesterday as I was walking by Matt's room I overheard him using his Alexa and I couldn't believe my ears. We don't have a cursing policy or anything like that in our household but the things he was saying were vile. Examples: stfu Alexa dumb  b*tch, Alexa turn my f*ckin TV on wh*re, etc. It just felt gross to me, I didn't raise my son to speak like that regardless if it's towards an object. 

I confronted Matt and told him I didn't like the way he was talking and he laughed and said it was towards his Alexa. I told him I didn't care he shouldn't talk like that at all. He said I was overreacting and I ended up taking his Alexa. I plan on giving it back to him once he understands that it is not okay to speak like that, God forbid he develops a habit and speaks to a future girlfriend like that. 

I talked to my husband about it and he agreed I overreacted, he pointed out that our son probably speaks way worse around his friends. I told him it just didn't sit well with me hearing that abusive language coming from our son.

185,1crmsik,AITA for not going to the schools camping trip with my friend?,"So, my school has this 3-day camping trip for seniors, where you do therapy-like activities, and it's supposed to be a bonding experience. I've known about it for a while, but I never wanted to go, and until recently, my mom was forcing me to.

Now, my friend Jane has been unsure about going too, along with my other friend Amy. But suddenly, Jane is dead set on going. I told her I didn't want to, and my mom said I didn't have to. Jane got really upset, saying I promised to go if she and Amy were going, which I never said. She accused me of leaving her hanging and ditching her, which isn't fair. I spent the whole day deciding whether I should go just for her sake or stay home.

All day, I saw Jane talking to teachers and friends about the trip, even getting one to tell me i HAVE to go because it's good for me. She even ignored me and only talked to me when she wanted to know if I made up my mind.

I was considering going until Jane told a teacher I wasn't going, which could get me in trouble because of how strict my school is. She's done this before when she's upset, like telling a teacher I didn't study for a test I failed because she also failed and was upset.

I got really mad and now I don't want to go at all. Especially because she's been angry at me all day and ignoring me. If I went, it would be awkward and upsetting for both of us. But I'm scared she'll be even angrier if I officially decide not to go, even though I won't talk to her when I'm there.

She has a lot of friends, and our other friend Amy is definitely going, but she's still really upset about me skipping it. I don't care about bonding with anyone else except my three friends. I have an early entry for uni coming up, and since I'm applying for a school based on my art portfolio, I wanted to spend the three days preparing for it. Plus, I get homesick easily and have been feeling ill.

I knew she'd be upset, and I get it, but I think she's overreacting, especially compared to my other friends who are fine with it. She even sent me a long message saying I ruined her day and that she's changing groups whether I go or not.

186,1crmra9,AITA for refusing to go to my half sibling's birthday party with my aunt?,"I (18f) live close to my aunt, in a house with a group of friends. I don't speak to my mom anymore and I'm totally independent from her and her husband because I work full time. I have her blocked on my phone and my social media. My aunt's aware and actually stood up to mom so many times over the years for me. She's always been cool and understanding about why things with my mom went south.

Where things have taken a turn is with my mom's other children. My aunt and mom don't get along but my aunt loves my mom's other kids as well (aka my half siblings). She has remained a part of their lives which is important to her. I didn't. I don't really want to either. I never saw them as actual siblings and really didn't spend any time with them while I lived with my mom so it was no big deal for me to no longer see them ever. One of them turned 6 a few days ago and my aunt was invited to the party and she was told she could bring someone so she wanted me to come with her. I told her I didn't want to go and my aunt encouraged me to come. She said even if I hate their parents and don't want to know my mom or her husband, the kids are my siblings and I could be a great influence in them. She asked me if I would feel the way I do if they were my dad's kids as well because he might have died before he could give me siblings but it didn't mean siblings from just my mom were useless or somehow less than. She told me she got asked questions by two of the kids about me and that I could always go through her if I wanted to see them. I told her I didn't want to see them or go to the party. She told me she expected better from me.

BG here for those who will request it: My dad died when I was 7. His death was very traumatic for me because I saw him die. Him and my mom were married but she never seemed too happy and she was pretty cold with me. Dad was my primary parent when he was alive. Only after he died did mom pay some attention to me. But then she met someone and moved him in very fast and she wanted me to call him dad and I told her no. She wanted me to be adopted by him and I said no again. I hardly remember their wedding because I was devastated and furious at the same time. Mom told me I was making it impossible for her to be happy by refusing to go along with the new family. Her husband would put so much pressure on me to forget about my dad and move on. He told me mom had only stayed with him for me and the least I could do was let dad go since he's dead and let him (her husband) take over since she actually wants him. For years the house was just tense and my mom and I pretty much hated each other. Me because she wanted me to erase dad and her because I wouldn't go along with that and made it pretty clear I hated her husband and her equally.

I take care of myself. I am in therapy. I go to a support group. I am ok and upon reflection this post makes things seem far worse than they now are. My dad is no longer smoking (I think). He does follow some of the food guidelines.

Mainly this is about his inability to connect with his family members on an emotional level. How can I go about helping him open up and feel more comfortable sharing/conversing with us?

———————-

My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about 6 months ago. I am a single mom and had recently moved in with them to save money. 
My dad has always been a smoker. He has always been a drinker (although not to excess) and is a very closed off person. I don’t remember him being around or being a part really of my childhood. He was working but my mom is, and has always been, the breadwinner. I think many of these things I resent him greatly for.

My parents’ plan was to retire in Italy and I would pay them rent which would cover their mortgage here as well as give them extra to live off of. This is the main reason I  moved in.
With the cancer, their plans have been ruined. My mom I feel is most affected by this. 

When we first got the diagnosis I thought right away we would do research, follow every rule and suggestion, but my dad kept smoking. And drinking.

There was one night my mom and I took a pack of his cigarettes and wrote death on each one in red sharpie (we realize this is very insensitive but we had tried every other healthy way to help him quit). The next day, without my mom’s knowledge, I took all of his liquor and dumped it.

The doctor said wine ONCE IN A WHILE was ok. This was only after she could probably tell he desperately wanted her to say yes to alcohol. 
He doesn’t follow the vast majority of the food restrictions. He also has diabetes as a side effect of the cancer. My mom and I try so hard to persuade him to eat healthy but he gets angered whenever we say…”maybe not steak tonight as the doctor said no red meat.”

He is an extremely quiet person. He just sits and looks at his phone. He does not open up and barely has a conversation even when we try so hard to do things to make him feel better. He has even blown up at my son. 

I want to be here to support him. I think it’s been really really hard on my mom. I do not think I can stay. It’s so toxic. And of course he very very much expects me to drive him to all his chemo appointments and cook meals and go grocery shopping and be there for him hand and foot. But I DO NOT WANT TO. It makes me feel like he doesn’t deserve it at all. He’s never kind or appreciative of anything. He barely speaks to me.

This Mother’s Day the first sentence in my mom’s card was “this day is not usually my responsibility…” SIR SHE IS THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD. And of course I did not get a card at all. 

His behavior is just really bizarre. I feel so extremely bad for him. More for my mom. I try to talk to him but truly I think he’s still very mad at me for throwing away all his liquor. But I don’t feel bad about it AT ALL.

Not to mention…he works at a wine shop. He says continuing to work makes him feel good, which is good. BUT We’ve just become aware that he’s doing “tastings” (meaning tasting alcohol and liquor) at work still. While having cancer and going through chemo.

I know this is a long confused rant. I love my family and help them daily with absolutely everything I can. I am having a hard time continuing to do so. Thank you for reading. I am at my wits end today. I’m sure tomorrow I will be a sweet cupcake person yet again. Oh the rollercoaster of emotions.
Am I an asshole?!

He doesn’t follow the vast majority of the food restrictions. He also has diabetes as a side effect of the cancer. My mom and I try so hard to persuade him to eat healthy but he gets angered whenever we say…”maybe not steak tonight as the doctor said no red meat.”

He is an extremely quiet person. He just sits and looks at his phone. He does not open up and barely has a conversation even when we try so hard to do things to make him feel better. He has even blown up at my son. 

I want to be here to support him. I think it’s been really really hard on my mom. I do not think I can stay. It’s so toxic. And of course he very very much expects me to drive him to all his chemo appointments and cook meals and go grocery shopping and be there for him hand and foot. But I DO NOT WANT TO. It makes me feel like he doesn’t deserve it at all. He’s never kind or appreciative of anything. He barely speaks to me.

This Mother’s Day the first sentence in my mom’s card was “this day is not usually my responsibility…” SIR SHE IS THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD. And of course I did not get a card at all. 

His behavior is just really bizarre. I feel so extremely bad for him. More for my mom. I try to talk to him but truly I think he’s still very mad at me for throwing away all his liquor. But I don’t feel bad about it AT ALL.

Not to mention…he works at a wine shop. He says continuing to work makes him feel good, which is good. BUT We’ve just become aware that he’s doing “tastings” (meaning tasting alcohol and liquor) at work still. While having cancer and going through chemo.

I know this is a long confused rant. I love my family and help them daily with absolutely everything I can. I am having a hard time continuing to do so. Thank you for reading. I am at my wits end today. I’m sure tomorrow I will be a sweet cupcake person yet again. Oh the rollercoaster of emotions.
Am I an asshole?!

He always told me that him and his ex split up because of the move and it was too hard to do long distance. He also said they grew apart and just weren’t getting along anymore. Fair enough. 

But here’s the thing: recently he admitted to me that the contract for his previous house in his home country is still in his name.. and his ex still lives there. So essentially he’s paying her bills. This upset me, but he convinced me that he couldn’t just break the contract and it’s expiring in a few weeks anyway so she will be moving out and he won’t have any ties to her anymore. 

Everything I’ve found out about his ex has been against my will. I never asked him 1 thing about her but somehow I know her name, what she looks like and details about their sex life etc. im honestly tired of it. I did politely mention to him to please stop mentioning her all the time, because I feel like we can’t move forward if he does, to which he apologised and agreed. BUT….. the other day we were hanging out, having fun etc. then he randomly became quiet and stopped talking. I asked him what’s wrong and he said “I just feel bad for what I did to *ex name*. I moved country and left her in a shit house, I feel bad about it.” 

I know it wasn’t right, but I flipped and told him to go back there then and be with her if he feels so bad. I told him stop leading me on if he’s still obsessed with her. He stormed out and sat outside by himself for an hour. I walked out and told him to go home because I’m going to sleep. We haven’t spoken properly since, and I know I shouldn’t have flipped out, but I’m too overwhelmed.

191,1crlk01,AITA for defending our friend who ditched us? ,"
for privacy i'm disguising names

so me and my friend group are all 14 years old, and I'd say that over the past couple of years we've been really close with eachother.


one of my friends is Lily. in the nicest way possible, she isn't really like the rest of us. she's very much a tomboy whereas the rest of my friends like ""girlish"" stuff. 

my whole group used to sit together at lunch, but over the past couple of weeks, Lily just stopped sitting with us. there's another girl in my group, Leanna, who doesn't like lily. so when lily stopped sitting with us, Leanna and a couple of other girls started talking about kicking lily from our groupchat. 

I didn't think this was fair at all. 

So a couple nights ago, we made a groupchat with only a couple of us in it that we would use for plans. In the group was me, natasha, Leanna, and a couple of other girls. Lily wasn't in it. 

We were talking about having a picnic sometime, and I was wondering who we should invite. Then Leanna and another girl said ""we don't want Lily to come"".

In Lily's defence, I said ""I know she ditched us but Lily told me once that she thinks we hate her"" and then everybody started screaming. 

They were saying things like ""if she thinks we don't like her, that's her problem"" and ""she's the one that ditched us"". Something that really got on my nerves was when this other girl Grace said ""it's not our fault she thinks we hate her"". 

I tried to make the situation a little better, so I said ""what if i try and talk to her and find out why she doesn't want to sit with us anymore?"". I wrote a paragraph which basically said ""We're sorry if we made you feel like we were excluding you. We never meant to do that.""


And then I started getting yelled at. 

""why are you apologising????"" 
""we haven't done anything wrong""
""don't apologise"" 


The same thing happened last night. We were talking about plans and someone said ""make a new gc, don't invite Lily"". They were saying ""if she wanted to come she'd ask"" even though she didn't know. 


""like we’ve told her over and over again that we like her and we enjoy her company, but clearly shes got it in her head that we don't.
but i dont see a reason to why we have to prove time and time again that we’re good friends. 
we’ve been nothing but nice to her and shes the one who decided that we hated her.""


I don't think we've been good friends. And I don't think we've been nothing but nice to her. 


I told Grace again, that we don't hate her but Lily thinks we do and that's not her fault. Grace just said ""why should we have to apologise though"". 


I don't even know if I want to be friends with grace or Leanna anymore. Especially because afterwards Leanna put on the groupchat ""Does anyone even like Lily? If you want her to come put a thumbs up"" 

I don't know how to handle this or how to make it better. Any advice would be soo greatly appreciated 🫶

192,1crljo2,AITA Dropped a friend for lying,"A month ago my friend got a bad score on a test, I'll call him Chris, and he told me not to tell anyone. Later that week during class, I asked my other friend, I'll call them Kate, if they knew Chris's score. She said no, and asked me what it was, to which I responded I can't tell you. She then texted Chris that I told her that he got a D (I didn't). She told me she did this later in the class. I immediately texted him I didn't, and he got slightly angry at Kate.
*Kate has been lying about things for quite a while, and hiding things from me, so this spurred me to leave alone after class and ignore her. 
She didn't text me or anything after I left her. An hour after this incident I kept proving Chris for the text messages as I wanted to know what she said, and he finally relented. The texts more or less had her saying that I told Kate, Chris got a D, him trash talking me, and her responding ""HAHAHAH"" to a bunch of it, before finally admitting she lied. I got upset at this because not only were these my close friends trash talking me, but Chris when sending me the messages he and Kate had, thought it was funny. I blocked him after this, and haven't spoke to either of them since. P.S. Chris would have told Kate his score if she had asked, but she chose to lie. Additionally, Chris knows that Kate lies often, so I also got upset that he would believe her so fast.
Neither of them have come close to saying sorry, or know what they have done wrong. I have stopped talking to them, and a bunch of my friends know about this incident too, promoting Chris to not have really any friends in the class I share with him. 
Additional note: Chris has been apparently calling me names behind my back now too, and him and Kate are still    friends.

193,1crlfvc,"AITA for making Instagram Reels behind my parents' backs, wanting to be a celebrity?","After having a year-long social media vacation for the entirety of 2022, I had began posting on Instagram Reels to generate relatable (and sometimes humorous) content; think themermaidscales, Ian Boggz, Haylee Baylee, and so on.

Not that I was much of a creator at the time; I just attempted to be creative and would sometimes wear a face mask when I didn't want to show off my face just yet. I also never talked about my life in general. This wasn't my primary concern; instead, I was attempting to spend as little time as possible during the day working for my parents in their family business so that, should I succeed in my own right, I can leave my primary position, which I don't particularly enjoy.

But this morning, my mother confessed that one of her coworkers had told her about my ""funny videos"" on Instagram, and that she and my father are planning to attend my ""class"" this evening.

  
I believe that the person who mentioned this to my mother was someone from my college who works under that colleague. Although it's not always the case, my parents now believe that the reason for the mountain of unfinished work is because I was preoccupied with this rather than my work. With the exception of the occasional monthly slip-up, I have been committed to attempting to finish tasks as soon as possible.  


What's even more concerning is that my parents don't think social media is humorous and are against publishing anything, especially political material (which isn't me, but they believe that posting something 'funny' would damage my reputation). In my opinion, it should be ignored, and as they say, out of sight, out of mind. I hope no one will think about it for too long now that my social media accounts are shut.  


I hope it's not too long because I have no idea what might happen. I've already made all of my social media accounts temporarily inactive and made my YouTube videos private, but I'm not sure how much of an impact it will have.

I genuinely owe them so much and I need to clarify they are great people. I’ve lived under these sorts of restrictions for a while and I’m used to it to be honest.

Here are some examples for context: I once wanted to study with my friend at a Starbucks prior to my exam and to only have my parents believe it was a cover for something else. There have been times when I’ve seen my parents spying on me by trying to sneak by and see who I’m with. This has even happened at where I work as well despite the fact that my job has no breaks. There is also no possible way for me to leave work. They will never admit that they were there too which is what makes me uncomfortable.

For context, I would consider myself a very responsible person. I work multiple jobs, pay for my own things, am one of the top students in my grade, and do not drink or smoke for example. I’m a pretty stereotypical goody two shoes. If that isn’t enough, I do debate and Model UN which says a lot already.

Recently my friend offered to take me with her family for a weekend trip which I have looked forward to following my exams. Their family was planning on going out of town and I have known her for over five years now. She is also extremely responsible and one of my best friends. When she asked me, I replied that my family would say yes. One of my parents is currently out of town however. Initially one of my parents said yes and suddenly changed their answer.

197,1crkm5d,AITA for not letting my wife’s female friend stay over?,"We live in a 1 bedroom apartment with a small living room that has a sofa-cum-bed.

My wife has a friend who lives close by and she sometimes comes over to stay for the night for no reason - once in a month or so.

I find it extremely uncomfortable since it is a small house and I need my personal space. 

She doesn't bother me by being loud or disturbing, and she sleeps on the sofa in the living room. 

But nevertheless, I don't like it when another person stays at my home. I have to tiptoe whenever I get out of my room and it just seems like a general violation of my personal space. I have to interact with the friend whenever I get out of the room and she can be a bit annoying.

My wife is too nice to ask her to not come, and this friend is always inviting herself over.

My wife also has another friend who visits our city every few months and invites herself to stay at our place for several days a week - same problem.

I have asked my wife several times to tell them not to come and that it makes me uncomfortable, but her niceness means she can't say no to them. She also says that it’s not a big deal and I am the bad guy.

Edit: I am fine with me telling her friends not to stay, but my wife doesn’t let me as she thinks it would be too rude. Also, my wife doesn’t do it for the company, she just does it out of obligation - she doesn’t WANT them to stay the night either, but she is fine if they do as it doesn’t bother her as much as it bothers me.",No A-holes here,2024-05-14,"AITA for not letting my wife’s female friend stay over?

198,1crklgc,AITA for walking out on my mom’s Mother’s Day dinner?,"My sister (31) and I (29) treated our mom (64) to a weekend-long Mother’s Day celebration, including the beach, her favorite show, and ending with a seafood dinner. 

My mom is a loving, boisterous, and compassionate person, but she also has a history with abuse that, when she’s triggered emotionally, can come out in ugly ways. She has a habit of taking mistakes as personal attacks, and instead of forgiving or even just being frustrated and calling it a day, she will take her anger out on people who don’t deserve it.

Unfortunately, this happens with wait staff when they mess up an order or behave in a way that she considers subpar. In fact, a few years ago, we went to a separate seafood restaurant, and she rudely accused our waiter of mistreating her when her crab legs came out cold. A huge fight ensued between us afterward.

Fast forward to this past Mother’s Day, and again, my mom mentions her crab is cold. The waitress offers to take the dish and replace it with a warmer dish. But unfortunately they come back to tell us they’ve run out of crab, which only frustrates my mom further. 

I can tell she’s growing more upset, so we (my sister and I) insist she orders another dish since the restaurant was willing to comp it for her, and she can at least enjoy a meal. She agrees, and at first it seems like things will be okay. But later, when our waitress gives my sister her drink and walks away from the table, my mom calls after her with a glare. She tells the waitress she wanted another martini as if the waitress was supposed to read her mind and know. When the waitress comes back with the martini and picks up the empty glass, my mom snatches the empty glass from her and pours a small dribble of the old drink into the new. 

Seeing the early signs of how things went down in previous years, I told my mom that she’s being rude, and I’m discomforted by her behavior. She goes into defense mode and demands to know what she did that was so wrong. She kept saying she has a right to send food back, and I said that wasn’t the issue, it was her treatment of the waitress, and now, also, the way she was speaking to me that made me uncomfortable. 

We’ve made so much progress as a family, and I didn’t want to end the night with a massive argument, so instead of further engaging, I told her one last time that it wasn’t about sending the food back, it was about her bullying behavior. If she wasn’t going to de-escalate, I would leave. She didn’t, and so I did. 

I feel like the AH because she said I ruined her Mother’s Day and that we “set her up” just to crush her joy. That wasn’t at all my goal. We did so much to make her weekend special. While I’m saddened, I’m glad I left instead of arguing like it seems she wanted. Still, I feel guilty. I love my mom. I didn’t want things to end like this. AITA?

So I (f 23) keep telling my b f (m 24) that he needs a career job. My b f and I have been together for 2 years and during those 2 years I’ve been in college (finished my bachelors and I am now pursuing my masters) my b f isn’t in college and he’s just been working part time jobs but the thing is he keeps losing these jobs and takes months to find new ones and goes broke every time and now it’s to the point where he’s homeless and living with a friend now. I’ve always told him that I don’t care if he doesn’t go to college but he should at least do trade school or something so that he can get certifications so that he can get salary pay so that he can make more money/ save more money for emergencies (like losing a job) and if/when he loses a job he can easily find another job to fall back on in that same field. I’ve told him this, my parents have told him this, his brothers have told him this, his family has told him this, his friends have told him this etc. but every time somebody tells him this he gets defensive and thinks we’re trying to bash him but we’re not. We’re just tired of seeing the same thing always happening to him (losing a job and asking everyone for money), every time we tell him this he thinks we’re saying he needs to go to college/university but we literally tell him word for word “that’s no what we’re saying.” I love him but it gets to a point where I’m tired of the same pattern, also I’m a broke college student so every time he loses a job and runs out of money I’m the only one that supports him financially (buying him food, toiletries, just little things because again I am a broke college student). He’s also extremely bad at managing his money when he loses a job, for example he has PlayStation + which is a $10 or $15 subscription for those who don’t know which allows you to play certain parts of games like online with friends, etc. so his aunt sent him $20 for food and instead of spending it on food he wanted to spend it on his PlayStation + subscription, and then when I told him he should use it on food instead he got annoyed and said I was telling him what to do, which I didn’t, I just made a suggestion. Also another reason I want this for him is so that he can have insurance because the amount of time I’ve known him he’s never had it and I want him to be able to take care of his health. 

So aita for telling my b f he should get a career job so that he make more money and can save more money, as well as have insurance?

Sorry if this is all over the place, I just started rambling at one point so please let me know if you have any questions/ need clarification. 

Edit: more clarification on things. He’s played football his whole life and is stuck on wanting to play football. He has football in his so called “5 year plan” or really just life plan in general, but I and many others have told him that he needs to focus more on a career at this point than football because football most likely isn’t going to happen, mainly because at his age colleges are looking at grad students that have already been football players (also he’s not out on the field everyday practicing, which I feel like if he was serious about football he would be doing that but he goes out on the field twice a month, sometimes not even that). Also money isn’t such a big deal with the trade school thing because my dad even offered to help him out a bit

Edit 2: thank you all for all of your opinions. I’ve decided that from now on I won’t financially support him anymore, and if his mindset/actions don’t change then it’s just time for me to leave 

Edit 3: he wants a career (he mainly wants to go into finance) but with that you kinda do need school which he knows but he can’t afford college at the moment which is understandable, so I’m not sure why he gets offended when we tell him that he needs to do something for a job whether it be school or not school (also I’m totally okay with him not getting a degree because a degree isn’t for everybody and plenty of people make millions without a degree)",Not the A-hole,2024-05-14,"AITA for telling my b f that he needs a career job?

Around 1 year ago, there was a single car accident in front of the home involving two (drunk) teens. They crashed into a tree near the street on our property and the car burst into flames. One of their mothers lives on the same street and placed a memorial in front of that tree. It is a big cross (about 4ft) with a picture of the teens and has a spotlight and lights wrapped around it. We are renovating the property so we have not moved in yet, but we went to talk to the mother as we were having that tree trimmed and wanted to ask her to remove the items. We were hoping she would understand that we wanted the entire memorial removed, but she only removed fragile items. She revealed to us that she would not be removing the cross as it’s not going anywhere because she cemented it into the ground. I have never lost a child so I can’t possibly know the pain she’s in, but I don’t understand how she could feel so entitled to do that in front of someone else’s home. We’ve decided to cut down the whole tree since half is burnt which is costing us 1.5k out of our pockets. We’ve spoken to the county about it as we found out it’s technically on their easement and they have confirmed they do not allow roadside memorials but they do not take them down if there is one. However, they said we are able to remove it ourselves if we want. I plan on writing her a letter in hopes she will remove it herself, but I’m questioning if that’s even the right thing to do.

Problem is she left her 2 large dogs with me. I already have a dog of my own and I live in a rental where I can only have my one small dog. One of the big dogs does not get along with my dog so logistically it is difficult. My other two daughters and I have been taking care of the dogs but it is a burden financially and with time. It has impacted our ability to travel and do other things together. My oldest daughter has not been the most responsible over the past few years and blames me for everything that’s wrong in her life. It is extremely frustrating bc as much as I want to help I feel it is her responsibility to take care of them but they were just left here with no discussion.

Sincerely, Mom Guilt",Asshole,2024-05-14,"AITA for giving up my daughter’s dogs? About 3 months ago my oldest daughter (22/f) left to go visit her BF for the weekend and never came back. Problem is she left her 2 large dogs with me. I already have a dog of my own and I live in a rental where I can only have my one small dog. One of the big dogs does not get along with my dog so logistically it is difficult. My other two daughters and I have been taking care of the dogs but it is a burden financially and with time. It has impacted our ability to travel and do other things together. My oldest daughter has not been the most responsible over the past few years and blames me for everything that’s wrong in her life. It is extremely frustrating bc as much as I want to help I feel it is her responsibility to take care of them but they were just left here with no discussion. I have not given up the dogs yet but I fear I am going to have to as having them here is jeopardizing my living situation. I haven’t given the dogs up yet and if I did it would be to a no-kill shelter or re-home them but I don’t know what to do. AITA? Help. Sincerely, Mom Guilt",1.0,0.09166087955236435,0,0
205,1crj5tv,AITA for discouraging my friend to talk about his dating life with me?,"My long-distance friend is currently studying abroad, but along with that, he is also exploring his sexuality. This has been going on for maybe 2 years, and it's honestly burning me out hearing about his hookups and him being heartbroken after a casual encounter. In my opinion, my friend wants true love but is lying to himself and settling for something casual. We used to be in the same boat since I also used to go through a hookup phase, but I've since outgrown that phase of my life and it has since gotten tiresome hearing my friend cry about decisions he has consciously made. 

  
I have since told him he can talk to me about life, family back home, his job and studies, but I have no emotional space left to hear about his dating life. Frankly, for the past couple of months before we stopped speaking, his dating life has been the only topic of conversation. We haven't spoken in a month and I'm taking this as a sign that he is either upset with me or really had nothing else to yap about besides his dating life. The last thing he wanted to talk to me about was getting his heart broken for the third time by the same guy, and right then and there, I set a boundary and told him I didn't wanna hear it. He further pushed and framed it as ""I'm proud of a decision I made and I think this shaped me as a person,"" but there are other areas of one's life that can shape you as a person and I've reached my wits end hearing about his hookups.

  
I might be the asshole here for dismissing my friend's emotional needs, but I did communicate with him that I've hit a limit. I'm not sure if I did something wrong here since he hasn't been reaching out. Am I the asshole?

  
(Further context: My friend is a gay male and I am a straight woman and this is all purely platonic, so jealousy isn't a factor here.)",Not the A-hole,2024-05-14,"AITA for discouraging my friend to talk about his dating life with me?

206,1crj2s5,AITA for being rude to my brother’s girlfriend ,"I (23F) said something pretty rude to my brother's girlfriend (21F).

Some context: My brother (22M) and his girlfriend have been together for three years, and she's always been really nice, I’ll even say too nice. However, during spring break my parents planned a ski trip and despite my parents inviting her with everything paid, she started complaining about the departure date, wanting to leave later in the week. But she never said anything directly to my parents, she only told my brother so he started saying they had to leave on a later date because of some uni stuff which was bs I know because we go to the same uni. At the end my mom said no and the gf  was pissy during the entire trip being rude and what not. She never said thank you. Since returning, she's been acting rudely towards me and being really passive aggressive. I confronted my brother and he said nothing wrong she just stressed but I know that’s bs in the three years I’ve known her she’s never acted this way.

Things escalated during a recent outing, we were going to a party together in my brothers car, when I mentioned needing to change my shoes before leaving, she suggested I take the subway instead which I responded with  ""No reason to be nice anymore, right? You've been with my brother long enough."" They had just celebrated their 3rd anniversary.

Now, she's giving me the silent treatment and my brother is mad at me.

207,1criygb,AITA for not being an urn bearer at my great uncle's funeral?,"Last week my great uncle(73) passed away in the hospital after he'd been in the nursing home for 22 years. When he was 51 he fell down his stairs and the injury resulted in him needing more care and he's been a resident of a care facility basically for as long as I've known him. My mom was his POA and one of the main people in his life that helped him out, almost as if she was his kid rather than just a niece. My great uncle didn't have a partner or kids of his own, so the entire rest of his family was very important to him.

Yesterday my mom was telling the rest of my family about his funeral arrangements that are in the works for his service next week. My mom said that he wanted to be cremated and didn't want any pallbearers. I'm confused because I thought pallbearers refer to caskets, and urn-bearers would be the term used for the people carrying the urn.

Today my mom texted me asking if I would be interested in being an urn bearer. I said ""I would, but I don't want to impose on anyone"". She said that both of my siblings and 2 of my other cousins would do it. I replied ""I thought he didn't want any pallbearers."" (trying to use the words that she used from his will). She just replied ""urn bearers"". I feel like my mom didn't understand what I was getting at, so I asked ""Do you think it would be against his wishes if we did that?"" She said ""Nope, that probably was way before he started going to church again.""

I feel like I'm in a moral dilemma of deciding whose side to be on: the dead's choice or the living's. Earlier today, my mom texted me and my siblings asking if we would want to perform any special music at mis memorial service. I said ""I feel like if he didn’t specifically ask for that, I wouldn’t want to."" No one responded.

To me it seems like my mom is trying to push for her kids to be a part of her uncle's funeral, almost in a way to prove a point that her and her family were a very important staple in his life. I feel like I'm being put in an uncomfortable position to chose. It feels like I'm being asked in multiple different ways to put my affection on display, and I have no idea if any other of my extended family members have been asked to be apart of his service. My great uncle had 5 other siblings, which resulted in 11 nieces/nephews and then 20+ nieces/nephews.

I don't want to be a part of any funeral arrangement that would go against his wishes. I also don't want to create some drama in the family by not being an urn bearer even when I was asked to. I'm leaning towards not being an urn bearer because it's more of a value to me to follow the wishes of a dead relative than to avoid some confrontation/conflict in my family.

208,1crerz5,AITA for not wanting to add my inexperienced friend to my project?,"Some context here, the project I’m referring to is a game, and I’m managing everything in a discord server. I met my friend, we’ll call him Aaron, in another game making server. After the game making server we met in basically died, I decided to start my own project, moving all the active developers moving into my server. Aaron used to work in npc development, but only in basic ideas and characters, none with depth; that is why I was apprehensive to make him a developer. 

So, today, I asked him if he wanted to join in as a developer in my server, and he immediately agreed. I first off asked Aaron what role he wanted to play in this, and he answered saying, “Character designer and lore guy (I can help with that stuff and handle loose ends).” I asked him if he had any past experience with in-depth lore and/or had any works he could present to show his skills. It was just some basic questions, and he responded with a summary of one of the characters he made. I asked him a few questions, and managed to discover several plot holes that just didn’t make sense. First off, his character had a bird form, and he made it the California Condor, despite the character being native to the icy mountains. Second of all, in the description for the appearance of his character, he said, “bird form is just stolas if he was a commoner, or something,” and, “human form is just a tall guy, still similar to stolas,” and that was it. There was nothing else, and mind you, this was one of the characters he was very proud of.

I didn’t know what to do, and did not want to hurt his feelings, but the backstory already had several plot holes, excluding the one I mentioned, and he just didn’t know how to design a create an in depth character. After he read my messages and understood that I was hesitant to hire him, he went into private dms and sent me this message, “why u being harsh.” It’s obvious he has no actual grasp in grammar nor punctuation, and his text was just under my basic standards. He is still mad at me, and I still offered him a job, only if he did better, but he has not responded yet. AITA for not really wanting to hire him and being this rude?
