0,1csr92k,AITA for confronting my best friends hypocrisy about our respective relationships ,"I moved across the country from a really bad home to live with my friends who’s a trans man and his mom. I’m so grateful for them helping me get on my feet. 
 I got a boyfriend recently and it’s been utterly wonderful to finally start rebuilding myself a bit and finding outlets of joy but recently my best friend has started being SO snarky and dismissive of my bf and has been going to his mom to talk to her about him and me in a negative way. Reposting things online about how he hates hearing about a bf and he doesn’t want his friends bringing their bfs around him and it’s tacky. 

For context I’m F20 my best friend is M18, I see my bf M22 about once a week. I’m sometimes on my phone texting around my best friend because my bf has a time consuming job so we do try and talk at nights or mornings which happens to be when my best friend is asleep but sometimes I do text my bf throughout the day for check ins. 

While on the other hand my best friend is in a long distance relationship and is non stop on the phone or calls or anything actively ignoring me in the room. Just always on his phone non stop. I’ve let it slide because I know his partner brings him so much joy even though trying to speak to him it’s always about a fight they had or whatever.

The complaining started right after we spent 4 days (only during the day for a few hours) with my bf and my best friends other friends, at a convention. 

When I say I’m going to see him I get eye rolls and overhear him complaining to his part er on the phone, his mom tells me to be basically more mindful of my friend, ect. This caused me to get defensive with his mom and ask why they make it sound like I’m bringing my bf over every day, blowing off plans, and constantly ignoring my best friend and his mom just said that’s between me and my friend. When asking him he just literally ignored me point blank and I’ve been quietly stewing about it. 

 I’ve spent a lot of time going out of my way to make my best friend know I’m there and caring and present when we hang out. I’m there for all his relationships issues and actively ask about his relationship because I know his partner makes him happy. I’m wondering what I can change to make him feel more seen and in touch with our friendship but it honestly hurts seeing him start reposting things online talking about leave your man at home no one wants him around and other things like that.

1,1csb52z,AITA for promising I wouldn't ignore someone and doing exactly that?,"Hi, I am 18F and he is 24M. I met this guy in January 2024. I went to a park with my friends and he was there, he looked at me for a while and then came to talk to me. I confess that I didn't find him very attractive, but he was very kind and polite, he introduced himself, asked my name and we had a small talk. I think he got a little nervous and left without asking for my number and I was also embarrassed to ask for his.

Over the months I went to that park a few times with my friends, but I forgot about it. Once, after about 4 months I went to that park again and he was there again and this time he didn't miss the opportunity, as soon as he saw me he asked for my number and I gave it, because even though I didn't find him very attractive, I thought it was unfair to judge him by his appearance.

We talked for a few weeks, but I felt weird because I had never dated someone that older than me and at the time, NO ONE asked for number. Without counting him, only one guy asked for my number in my entire life.

With each passing day I felt more strange, he seemed to have created some admiration for me, he had praised me a few times, where I even thanked him and tried to reciprocate, but I couldn't feel the same way about him, especially because inside me I didn't seem accepting the idea of liking someone at the moment.

At first I felt like it was wrong to not like him when he wasn't doing anything wrong, but after I understood that it was ok to not like someone, I wrote him a message and I was completely honest. I said I wasn't feeling good in that situation because I wasn't mentally available for a relationship and I apologized for giving my number only to later say I was unavailable, but I explained saying that when we started talking, I thought I was available, but I wasn't. .

He said he understood and was really nice to me even though I felt like an asshole inside. In that conversation, I promised that there wouldn't be a bad atmosphere between us, I said that when we saw each other again I would talk to him normally.

Turns out I couldn't. We met about 2 times after that because we went to basically the same places, he tried to make some contact with me, but I felt so ashamed to talk to him, so ashamed that I ran away from him.

In my view, I was the confused girl who hurt the guys she talked to, so I felt ashamed to face him.

After that, the third time we met, he also started ignoring me, I feel like I deserved it, am I the asshole?",No A-holes here,2024-05-15,"AITA for promising I wouldn't ignore someone and doing exactly that?

2,1csb0s0,AITA for telling my mom how I feel? ,"So I'm gonna start this off with saying I suck at explaining how I feel in posts and well I have a hard time explaining anything anywhere so if what I say doesn't make sense in some parts I do apologize. Hi, my name's Cj I'm a soon to be 26 (may 22nd aye, only eight days away from posting this) male who just kind of had a blown up at my mom but no yelling conversation with my mom. My mom (soon to be 49) had me as a bit of an accident, her and my dad (who lives in Vegas) had ""one last go"" before my mom moved back to Wisconsin and then found out she was pregnant with me a few months later. Growing up she always told my dad didn't want anything to do with me, was an alcoholic, drug addict and other horrible things so she never let me talk to him or let him come to Wisconsin to see me or us go out to Vegas to meet him at all (I never met him or talked to him). After he passed away in 2011 I started talking to his side of the family like my aunts, uncles and grandma. A year or so after talking to them I asked them if my dad ever talked about me to them or how he wanted to see me, they told me that he loved me so much and was trying to do everything he could to see me and meet me. A couple years ago I asked my aunt about my dad being an alcoholic and all that, my aunt said my dad never touched the stuff, only drug he did was a bit of weed every now and then, no alcohol or hard drugs. When I found that out I was heartbroken and I kind of kept it inside of how I felt for a few months, when I confronted her about her lies she denied ever saying anything like that but my grandparents, uncle and other family members all tell me that she said all those bad things about him all the time. My dad from when I was born to when he died, tried so hard to meet me and spend time with me but my mom denied him every time. Denied me my father and made up lies about him to make me think he was a bad man but he was the complete opposite. 

That's one of the things I blew up at her about, here's the others. When I was about 4 or 5 years old my mom married  my ex step dad (they divorced when I was 10) and they had my two younger sisters (that information will come into play soon). For the years my mom was married to, let's call him C, C abused me mentally and physically but that's it. She never once defended after he did those things except for maybe a couple times in the beginning. Now if my sisters (one who is 6 years younger than me and the other is 8 years younger than me) had been treated even an ounce badly she would defend them right away. Fast forward to the present, I left my mom to live with my grandparents at the age of 10 (right after their divorce) when they got legal custody of me cause I was dealing with a lot of mental stuff kids that age should never deal with (depression, PTSD and more),I included that part of moving in with my grandparents cause it was at that time she never told me she loves me, appreciates me or anything since then. I always had contact with her, visited her dozens of times a month with my grandparents, stayed with her, lived with her for a year back in 2021-2022 after I got out of the mental hospital. I have done so much for her, after my dad died I started getting social security death benefits (I believe that's what it is called I'm not to sure) monthly but since I was still young my mom was getting them, I didn't get a PENNY from those which were supposed to go to me and my care cause she was using it all on herself for rent when I didn't even live with her, random bull crap and more. When I was able to open my own bank account when I was 16 with the help of my grandparents I started getting those checks myself. When that happened she went off the handle and blamed me for her possibly getting kicked out of her place, not being able to afford food and other things when she had a great paying job that she was able to more than support herself and my two sisters as a single mom. Ever since then my mom constantly guilt trips me into helping her out with money (she makes almost twice as much as I do) for bills and food, I used to do it every time and she never thanked me for it, said she loved me for doing it or anything. I've recently stopped doing it but she still brings up in random phone conversations or texts quite literally out of thin air (we can be talking about random things like the weather) like saying ""yeah I don't think I can afford the electric bill this month cause my whole paycheck went to rent and I don't even think I can get groceries"" but yet she can afford getting more random crafts she'll lose interest in  in a matter of days, new bags, water bottles and more. 

Okay sorry for the long winded explanation, this all boiled up to yesterday (day after mother's day) when she posted stuff about what my sisters got her for mother's day, nothing about what I got her even though I spent $100+ on her and not even a thanks or I love you for it. I called her and asked why she didn't include what I got her she simply said ""I don't know"" and for some reason that set me off to where I spent about 25 minutes telling her how she has made me feel like a son she never wanted and doesn't want by saying she kept me from my dad for no reason, she let the abuse happen, she drains me of my money, doesn't say I love you, makes everything about her like when my grandma died, how she hurts me with all the bad stuff she's done to me, talks bad about me behind my back (I know this cause my sisters tell me when she does when she talks to them and vice versa for me to them), doesn't care if I died barley able to get a coherent sentence together cause I'm choking on tears. All she had to say was ""so you just think I'm a horrible mother? Should I just go die in a hole then? Would that make you feel better?"". When she said that I just hung up the phone and cried till I had to go to work, I work with kids so I had to put on a strong face. We haven't talked since then and I don't know how long it will be till We do..... So AITA for finally letting her know how I feel about what she's done/does to me?

He borrowed about $100 from me about a year back, to pay to go clubbing or whatever. Dude texted me while I was pulling a 16 hour night shift, I told him to pay me back within a month and transferred over the money. I asked for my money back exactly a month later, he says he has no money. Months go by and I stopped asking for my money back as it's a lost cause. 

He's the type of dude who can't save money at all, he would get $500 from his dad and blow it within a day or two. I simply refused giving him any more ""loans"". 

Now last week he texts me and asks for $1,500 loan and promised to pay me back in installments. Told me he would pay me half of the money he gets from his dad until debt is paid. He wanted the money for a new iPhone. I told him literally every mobile carriers offers 0% & $0 down contracts, but his credit is so bad that he can't even get qualified for that. 

So I told him that I would loan him $1,500 if he paid me back the $100 he owed me first. Of course, I'm not a fool and had no intentions of even lending him a dollar. He agrees and transfers me $100. I get a request of $1,500 from him the next day. I decline and tell him that I'm not going to loan him a dime forever. I told him to get his act together. Either stop blowing your money or get a job.

I only get 4.5 days of vacation time a year, and really didn't want to call off. I called my mom to ask her if she could reschedule the appointment. She flipped out on me, saying I was selfish, and didnt care about herself. Started guilt tripping me about how I'm not taking care of her, and how she's gonna end up alone. 

Finally she calls the doctors, and they can't re-schedule. I'm frusterated because she could take an uber to and from, but still insists that I should do it because I owe her for everything she's done for me growing up. 

We don't have a good relationship at all, and she's starting to get all these health problems suddenly in the last year from her untreated diabetes (she's only 50 and has almost no retirement savings). 

Well the truth is, I really don't feel like taking care of her in the future. I'm her only child, only family, and she has one other friend to speak of. My mother really is a lonely person, and I don't know what she's gonna do when she goes blind from the diabetes. (Which is what she currently has trouble with)

She hates it, but enjoys hearing the drama and making cookies and all the tips she gets for being nice. So after work she likes to check on the peppers, fruits, and veggies. On her weekends (thurs & fri) shes been taking it upon herself to deweed the garden. Her fiance said he felt hurt by this.

Their disagreement starts here, he says that the weed pulling was his project to begin with, and when she does it without him, it hurts his feelings. He wants to pull weeds with her, he spends all day working at the house (more physical labor) and would like to spend her weekends with her relaxing, and they can weed pull when its sunny, or before she goes to work (she leaves for work at 1pm)

My mom says that its her weekend and she should get to choose what she wants to do on her weekend, she didnt even listen to his argument, it was clear she was just waiting to respond. After he left to take a nap to subside his aggressive feelings, my mom turns to my sister and I and asks us what we think.

My sister does her usual mediation tactic to ""find a middle ground"" and not giving her opinion, but just trying to make both sides happy. I said ""You should apologize"" and she blew up on me asking ""why should i have to? its MY day off!""
""because it was his project first, and youre taking it over.""

She didnt apologize, and has been sleeping on the couch instead of their shared bed. She won't talk to her fiance or me, just my sister and brother

7,1csa2ui,AITA for not feeling comfortable telling my mother I’ve had mental health issues,"26M

My family is going through a very traumatic time. My dad kind of lost his mind and turned incredibly abusive towards everyone especially my mother. My mom left the house and my dad stayed until the divorce was finalized. He then disappeared and left the house in horrendous condition. It’s been a long long time of trying to deal with this situation and get everything back together and it’s been very tough on everyone.

Unfortunately my girlfriend has had to deal with some of this by extent because it’s taken a toll on me. I feel very bad about this and I’ve been trying my best to keep everything together but I’ve also had to help my mom out a lot because it’s been extremely hard on her and, while I have two younger siblings, one is autistic and the other lives out of state. 

My girlfriend has said that I need to set boundaries with my family because this is a lot for me and that is true. But I have also tried to explain to her that, because of the fact that there’s only so much my other siblings can do, I have to do what I can to help my mom. She’s upset that I don’t force my siblings to do more and she doesn’t seem to understand that there’s a lot of stuff they just cannot do.

She’s obviously noticed that this has been hard on me but I’ve also confided in her and let her know that I’ve had some feelings of depression and panic attacks at some points. Nothing too serious as I’ve had these symptoms before my family issues but I still wanted to let her know. I also told her that I didn’t want my family to know because they have enough going on and they don’t need another thing to worry about. I have no problem restricting what I can do to help if I can’t do something because of these issues.

Now it’s at a point where my girlfriend is saying that if I don’t tell my mom that I’m depressed and I have panic attacks that she doesn’t want to be in this relationship anymore. I feel horrible but I just don’t see how that will help anything because I already have been able to limit what I do to help when I’m getting overwhelmed. It’s just a tough situation regardless and it’s unfortunate.

8,1csa10i,AITA for watching a movie with my boyfriend in the apartment after my roommate went through a bad breakup?,"My roommate (Belle, 19f) and I (19f) have been at each others throats for as long as we have lived together, but recently it got worse when her boyfriend (22m), Mile, was revealed to be not only a cheater but a predator who takes photos of women at his place of work. Before this incident, Belle and I had not spoken for month and she was overtly hostile - going as far as inviting over her boyfriend to spend the night when she knew I could not stand him.  
 When they broke up, she apologized for her behavior and asked for my friendship back. For as long as Belle and Mike have been together I have not liked him. 

On the night of my birthday she allowed him to spend the night without asking me, as they were both too drunk to drive when she brought up the question (we had previously discussed and agreed that all overnight guests should be cleared with whoever was home). i couldnt say no due to their state of intoxication. they proceeded to loudly have sex that could be heard in all the apartment. I asked he not spend the night after that, but was fine with day visits. She constantly asked, so I agreed on the condition that communal spaces weren’t violated. 

Recently she and him broke up, after she found out that he was cheating in a variety of ways and taking photos of women and of her while he was working and they first met (they were coworkers, she was underage at the time). She knew he was a sex addict, but had not thought it would lead to him cheating. 

She was devastated, understandably, and banned men from the apartment for a while and I obliged her for a few weeks. I now have a boyfriend  (19 m) who comes over to watch movies and hang out, never violating common areas or spending the night if she is over.

 She recently got back together with him and has kept the banning of all men from the apartment yet spends nights at Mikes place.

She recently left for a trip without informing me and when I saw she was back in the state I gave her a heads up about the fact that my boyfriend was going to stay over, as she had not told me to expect her back. She accused me of violating her boundaries and when I mentioned the past violation of mine she told me that she was currently going through a tough time in her life.

 I’ve asked her and she said there was nothing against my boyfriend specifically it’s all men.

He's never tried to build a relationship beyond throwing money at me and I've accepted that we'll never be close. My mom got married when I was 2. My stepdad has three kids (21M, 18F, and 17M) and they have four kids together (14M, 11M, 9F, and 6M). My mom doesn't work so money is tight sometimes. My mom is like my stepsiblings' real mom. Their dad has never been like my real dad. After they got married, they focused on creating their new life together and I didn't fit in their perfect family.

My stepsister and I were never able to build a relationship. When we were little, my dad would buy me better toys and sometimes I let SS play with me, but she would break or steal my things so I started to keep my stuff from my dad hidden. We were both too young to know better. Even as we got older, we never got closer. My mom prioritized my stepsiblings in very obvious ways and I was jealous of that.  SS is jealous of the things my dad bought me. I've always had lots of new clothes, electronics, and makeup while she doesn't. She also has two loving parents while I have none. Our biggest fight was when we turned 16, my dad got me a car and threw me a big party. She said some very hurtful things. I now try to avoid her.

Like most people, I see him as a kind, quiet guy with a good heart who can be socially awkward, even slow at times.   


From the time I got hired at this place (and met this guy) to early 2020 when the pandemic hit, the two of us had hung out for a total of 5-6 times to grab a few drinks, mostly after work. 5-6 occasions of a few drinks in a span of 2.5 years, talking mostly about politics or people at work. No personal or emotional sharing whatsoever. No lunch together at work either, just casual talk here and there. In the past 8 years, he gave me a few rides home (<10) after work. After the pandemic and especially last year, we did try to hang out a few times but never got around to it. Not a big deal, even felt relieved as his conversation has gotten noticeably dull or so I began to feel that way at this point.   


I had to take a long leave of absence this fall due to an accident & this guy was one of the few people from work who regularly checked in on me. I made the effort to let him know that I appreciated it. He would call or txt me occasionally, ask if I need anything and offer to take me outside for some fresh air, as I was mostly resting at home due to my injury. The only favor I asked was grabbing a few things from my office and drop them off at his convenience. He made a terrible mess, brought some of my stuff in pretty damaged condition but no surprises there, he can get clumsy at times, so I didn’t say anything. Offered him some tea, about half an hour later, he was gone. This was the first (& last) time he got into my apartment. I don’t have people from work come over to my place, this was an exception due to my injury. Few hours later, I noticed he’d taken my thrash out when leaving, without letting me know. Completely unnecessary since my building has a maintenance guy who takes care of that and I had placed my thrash by my unit door that afternoon for the maintenance guy to pick it up later. Common practice here.  


Since his visit, this guy txt’ed me at 8AM on weekends with single liners like “are you back on your feet?” or “how is your recovery going?” Two weeks ago, he called and mentioned within minutes that he was close to my street. I made nothing of it and casually carried on, he then said he was near my building. At this point I noticed the absence of ambient sounds like traffic noise etc., thinking he probably parked somewhere, possibly in front of my building. Didn’t react, tried to carry the conversation until he interrupted me “Want me to come upstairs?” in a really weird excited tone. I got quite uncomfortable, pretended I didn’t hear it and rushed to finish the call. Before he hung up he said  “I will come by” which got me creeped out. Since then he txt’ed me a few times and gave me a call yesterday. Didn’t write back, didn’t take his call. I feel somewhat forced into a connection that was never there.

13,1cs9j1h,AITA for not saying “hi” to my friend’s husband in the waiting room at the gynecologist?,"This is my third visit in two months to the gyno after an abnormal pap and needing to minor but painful treatment. I’ve been dreading this  appointment so I’ve been in self-care mode - took the week off work (self-employed), wore sweats/no makeup (rare for me), and flew my best friend out as a support (my husband currently has a broken foot). My friend offered to come into the hospital with me, but I suggested she hang out in the cafe nearby and I could text her when I was ready to be picked up. 

As I was sitting in the waiting room kind of panicking about the procedure (I hate pain), I noticed a man across the room looking at his phone.

I just wasn’t in the mood to say hello to someone I barely knew with all that was on my mind. I could tell he looked at me a few times but I ignored him. When I was finally called in, I had to pass him and he said “I knew it was you! Hi! Lindsey is here too!” I ignored him getting through the doors with the nurse as fast as possible. 

A few hours later as I’m settling into recovering at home, I got a text from my friend Lindsey asking why I didn’t say hi back to her husband.

14,1cs9eut,AITA For wanting to call out my ex-boyfriend's weird online behavior?,"A few years ago, I met a guy at a convention in Phoenix who did cosplays similar to my cosplays. We got along well and eventually began to have more intimate experiences together, although he insisted it was ""just friendly"". Whether kissing and making out is ""platonic"" or not is up to the person doing it, I suppose. Anyways, we broke up a few months after meeting and the whole experience really traumatized me for a while. He had sent his friends after me and all that. Normal teenager online drama. I avoided him at all costs for a good year or two until I started pursuing cosplay as a bigger thing. I discovered that he had a big following for his cosplay on TikTok and Instagram. He followed my group's Instagram account and I realized it probably wasn't worth avoiding anymore. 
That was when I began noticing strange behavior between him (who is now an adult) and a 16 year old non-binary fan artist. They would publicly flirt in the comments of posts, post about how much they love each other on Instagram stories, and for a brief period of time they publicly roleplayed pregnancy on Instagram. I watched all of this go down over the course of several months and screenshotted everything even remotely concerning. 
I am now also an adult and currently in a happy relationship with my boyfriend. I shouldn't be so concerned with my ex-boyfriend's behavior, right? But.. this guy is showing some weird signs of possibly grooming a minor and it's getting to be really weird now. 
I want to come out publicly about it, but I know I can't because of my status and my career at the moment. So instead, I've spoken privately to a few people associated with the ex-boyfriend and they've all said that it's weird, but I should probably stop looking at it.

My Dad filed for divorce during the pandemic, and all of us (myself, dad and 2 adult siblings) are NC with her. Every event or holiday, my mother would make a bunch of ""woe is me"" posts on Instagram. For years, we all just ignored it and blocked anyone who sent us DMs, telling us to ""forgive and forget"".

Last week was my younger sister's 21st Birthday, and our mother took to Instagram with more posts saying how my sister ""robbed her"" of being able to celebrate, and the fact that none of her kids invited her means that were all ""ungrateful"".

Your ungrateful child remembers."" After that, I turned my phone off and went back to celebrating with my family.

Once the festivities died down, we all turned off Do Not Disturb and saw that there were dozens of DMs from our mother and various people (who we assume are her friends) making wild accusations about me, saying that my dad put me up to it, etc etc. Everyone turned to me, asking what the hell I did, and after I explained it, my dad told me that I should've stayed silent to keep the peace.

16,1cs93xk,AITA for not picking up calls or wanting to talk to her anymore ,"I think I know I am but here’s the story. 
2 years ago my best friend asked me if I could help a friend of hers with some relationship problems and family law issues.   I agreed as I’m happy to help anyone who needs anything and if I can offer advice I don’t t have an issue.  I used to work in a legal aid office so have a bit of knowledge but am not a lawyer. 
This 27 year old female has literally called me everyday for the past 2 years - she has a 2 year old son.  Initially I spoke to her for about 2 hours a day and gave her information and signposted her to people and places.  I soon figured out she didn’t really follow my advice and ended up getting deeper into problems with the ex and the family law courts. She basically did the opposite to what I advised or what her lawyer said.  For a whole year and a half I spoke to her almost every day but then it started to get a bit overwhelming for me. I could not talk to her hashing the same things over and over again. She’d call really early in the morning or late at night and expect to be listened to. If she had a an argument or pick up or drop off went bad she expected me to pick up so she could talk through her feelings. Regardless of me being at work or at home or even if I was out. Most often she would be angry upset and mad at the ex or whoever.  For the past 6 months I have just communicated by text and the odd 15 minute phone call.  She has now spoken to my best friend and said that I’m not being supportive enough to her and my best friend is annoyed with me. 

At the time I thought this girl she referred to was a close friend but since then I have found out they are not very close and only mutual friends. So I don’t get why my best friend is really that upset with me. I spoke to the girl and said I’m going through some issues of my own ( which I am)
And I need time to get over this and need to keep some time for myself and my family. 
She is now saying that I knew she didn’t have any other female friends and that I shouldn’t have encouraged her to talk to me because now she needs to find someone else and start at the beginning again. She made it sound like I was  her shrink and I was making her start therapy or something.  I have previously encouraged her to reach out for mental health support but she said she didn’t need it.  She has parents and siblings who in my opinion have supported her so much and she often says horrible things about them which I think is unfair.  She called me yesterday and I didn’t pick up, it was like 5am and it broke my sleep and I was totally pissed off as I couldn’t get back to sleep again. My best friend thinks I should carry on being supportive but right now I just haven’t got it in me anymore.

19,1cs8wq0,AITA for not wanting to spend time with my widowed dad’s girlfriend,"About a year ago, my mom passed away suddenly and unexpectedly.

My mom always joked that my dad would bring a date to her funeral and sure enough, a female “friend” showed up to sit with him. It became obvious over the following weeks and months that they were in a relationship, although he tried to deny this for a long time. I actually suspect that they were involved before my mom passed away, as my dad has a history of affairs, the girlfriend has a history of affairs with other married men, and she had given him some expensive tools that she allegedly didn’t need anymore in years leading up to my mom’s passing. My dad doesn’t know that I suspect this and I haven’t said anything to him about it.

My dad almost immediately started bringing the girlfriend to public events like sports games and school events for my child and nieces/nephews. I expressed to my dad several times that while it was his choice to move on when he was ready, I personally was not ready to have a relationship with the girlfriend. At times, he will act understanding about this and then will continue to message about when we can all get together and when she can have contact with my child.

Just last weekend, I reiterated to him that I wasn’t ready for that level of contact and did not want her spending time with my child. Today, I learned that he had the girlfriend at his home without my permission while my child was there and knowing that I objected to this. I told him that it was not acceptable to have ignored my wishes. He is angry at me saying I am being ridiculous.

AITA?

  
ETA: Someone had a question about this, so wanted to add. My parents, specifically my mom, had provided routine childcare for my child since birth, as they were both retired and thought child should be with them vs. in daycare. 

Since my mom‘s passing I have done my best to make other childcare arrangements for my child whenever possible. There are a few times a month that I may ask him to pick her up from school or spend a few hours with my child until I’m back in town from work. He claims to want to do this and complains if/when he feels he hasn’t had enough time with her lately.

The girlfriend doesn’t live with him and they spend time together at her home when they get together, so I think it isn’t a big ask for her not to be around during the limited time he’s with the child.

21,1cs7w3z,AITA for not forgiving my friend's ex.,"A few months ago during winter break of my 3rd year, my friend's ex cheated on him with another guy. My friend was destroyed and he was depressed for weeks after this happened. Despite all of this, he never fully cut her off. Now they are on strong talking terms again and are even back to being friends. I was also friends with his ex before this all happened but since then I sort of tapped out of the friendship because I lost all respect for this woman. There is nothing I hate more than people who cheat, in my opinion its one of the most disgusting things someone can do. This means that as a third party to this rekindled friendship between my friend and his ex, it has been a weird and conflicting experience. Even though she is still actively with this other guy, she is still extremely intimate with my friend, touching him and using pet names. I have made sure that he is comfortable with this numerous times and every single time he says that while he doesn't love it, it makes his ex happy so he doesn't mind. I kind of understand this because the guy she is currently with is quite toxic but that also isn’t his problem. This dynamic has gone on for months at this point and I have been bottling up more and more resentment towards this woman. I hate how she is using my friend as nothing but a comfort toy and I hate how he is just letting this happen to him. It got to the point where I couldn't hold it in anymore and I snapped. She was doing her usual stuff with my friend being intimate, saying I love you when I just flat out told her that she was lying. I told her that this whole dynamic was really annoying and that I hated her presence, I hated how she was using and treating my friend. She got defensive and tried to say that my friend was completely fine with what was happening and regardless of whether or not he was I didn't care. I was so done with her bullshit.

She stopped talking to me after that which doesn't bother me but what has me concerned is that my friend has also changed his behaviour towards me. Lately, he has seemed a lot more cold and distant and I feel it has to do with what I said. His ex thinks that it's stupid that I'm still so mad at her because this happened so long ago and that she didn't cheat on me. She doesn't think I should be so angry and that it's not my place to ""forgive"" in this situation.

Maybe its not my place to forgive, but thinking about what she did to him and how it made my friend feel makes me furious. I can't be friends with someone who has done something like that. Despite being his ride or die, it almost feels as though he's about to choose being friends with his ex over me. I really don't want to lose this guy but it really seems like he's about to choose her over me. I still want to maintain the close bond I have with my friend but I feel like I won't be able to do that unless I move on and make up with this girl. I’m not gonna make him pick and choose but I will never forgive this girl for what she did.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-15,"AITA for not forgiving my friend's ex. A few months ago during winter break of my 3rd year, my friend's ex cheated on him with another guy. My friend was destroyed and he was depressed for weeks after this happened. Despite all of this, he never fully cut her off. Now they are on strong talking terms again and are even back to being friends. I was also friends with his ex before this all happened but since then I sort of tapped out of the friendship because I lost all respect for this woman. There is nothing I hate more than people who cheat, in my opinion its one of the most disgusting things someone can do. This means that as a third party to this rekindled friendship between my friend and his ex, it has been a weird and conflicting experience. Even though she is still actively with this other guy, she is still extremely intimate with my friend, touching him and using pet names. I have made sure that he is comfortable with this numerous times and every single time he says that while he doesn't love it, it makes his ex happy so he doesn't mind. I kind of understand this because the guy she is currently with is quite toxic but that also isn’t his problem. This dynamic has gone on for months at this point and I have been bottling up more and more resentment towards this woman. I hate how she is using my friend as nothing but a comfort toy and I hate how he is just letting this happen to him. It got to the point where I couldn't hold it in anymore and I snapped.

22,1cs7lhr,AITA for making my sister pay for her own food?,"I (16M) take care of my siblings while my parents are at work. I don't really mind taking care of my brother (M8) and sister (F12), and I've actually spent around a few hundred dollars that I've earned working for my parents. I've been buying my siblings food such as fast food or groceries that I cook since my parents get home pretty late, which I understand cause they have to work to support the family too.

A week ago, I told my sister that she has to be able to buy herself food that she wants to eat because she has the opportunity to earn the money and that I won't always be there to buy her stuff. I have also told her that one day she gotta buy food for me since I pay for everything, but I don't mind if she doesn't. 

So yesterday, I bought my siblings Raising Canes cause my sister wanted it. I tell my sister that she has to pay for it cause I can't pay for it everytime. She says yeah and when I got home, she wouldn't give the money unless I told her I'm going to eat it since I payed for it. My sister gets annoyed and she goes to get the money and just throws it on the table. 

I kind of got annoyed at it and just held it in. I feel like maybe I've gone too far and should be a little bit nicer.

Originally I thought he was a good friend who had best intentions of helping me out of a bad home life away from my family. We had it good for 9 months but then out of nowhere, I find him unbearable to be around. He was kind, there for me, supported me emotionally, and became my best friend for a while. But now. He’s sloppy, has no respect for my belongings, or my car, doesn’t clean up after himself, “accidentally” mixes his laundry with mine when I’m doing mine so his gets clean, and asks for money from me. In the past, I’ve sat him down for a serious conversation about his actions but all he does if apologize profusely and cleans up his act for 2 weeks and goes right back to his old ways. About a month ago I informed him I no longer wish to share a living space with him because of his repeating behaviors. He blocked the door when I tried to leave to get some air. I told him he was scaring me by doing this and about to bring up some PTSD issues I have. He didn’t move. We argued for hours and I never got to leave. I hid in my room until the next day. I didn’t bring it up again and then a week later he asked if I still felt that way, out of fear I told him no. I told him everything is fine but, while at work on my lunch break, I look at apartments and have virtual tours. I found an apartment I really like and applied for it. My plan is to move out when he’s at work and block him from everything. I want nothing to do with him ever since that day I felt trapped. I did not leave one bad situation just to get into another. I tried to have reasonable conversations with him but he turns into a child and throws tantrums when I speak about anything that could mean me leaving. He tells me my feelings about him are invalid from our arguments because that was the “old” him. Old him meaning last night, few days ago, or however he sees fit. At this point I don’t care about the $2K he owes me for paying for his half of rent, I’d rather leave in peace without it than stick around and wait for him to pay me back. On the other side, for his behalf; If I leave, he won’t be able to afford an apartment on his own. His family is states away. If I leave he might become homeless.

25,1cs78m3,AITA for letting my dog go to the bathroom on my neighbors yard. ,"genuinely, i am sure if i am the asshole. 

so for a little context i live in a fairly crowded suburb of a large city, basically my neighborhood is four blocks of single family homes that are boarderline kissing eachother (i feel like this is important idk)

multiple times a day, i take my dog on a walk around the same four blocks. i walk on the sidewalk, and my dog walks next to me, but on the grass that is technically part of the front lawns. there is multiple family style unit. with the biggest most green lawn on the entire four block stretch ( 7' by 15' patch) my dog takes two fat dumps on that lawn every single day since the first day i had him( i have never left dog poop anywhere, i always pick it up) because of this, i have met everyone who ever lived in that building including the landlord. on the occasion that i met him, i was in the middle of picking up my dog's poop from the yard, he came over, thanked me for picking up my dogs poop and told me that if i wanted i could throw away my poop bags in their trash can, which i never did besides the day he offered. 

two weeks ago a new tenant moved into one of the units, and three times since the moved in my dog has been taking his nightly doodoo on their lawn, she agressively tells me that my dog cant step on the grass. there are a lot of dog owners in the neighborhood that ive met on my walks including the woman who lived in that unit up until she moved in. my dog is arguably the largest one. i have yet to mention to any of the dog owners in the neighborhood.

 i can understand the sentiment of not wanting a dog to poop essence on your lawn. i guess im looking for clarity about whether or not this good dogowner behavior? the first time this happened i was pretty pissed but after getting scolded for the third time in two weeks, i told her that when i had met her landlord all that time ago, he hadnt had a problem with it, but her argument was that she didnt care about that because shes the one who lives there now (it's technically three apartments but yes). i get that argument too. 

now ive half heartedly attempted to have my dog avoid that specific lawn but he is fairly confused why we are now avoiding prime poop territory. if i decide to change this dog owner bevahior, i might have to start talking him on a new walk route entirely.
