0,1csr92k,AITA for confronting my best friends hypocrisy about our respective relationships ,"I moved across the country from a really bad home to live with my friends who’s a trans man and his mom. I’m so grateful for them helping me get on my feet. 
 I got a boyfriend recently and it’s been utterly wonderful to finally start rebuilding myself a bit and finding outlets of joy but recently my best friend has started being SO snarky and dismissive of my bf and has been going to his mom to talk to her about him and me in a negative way. Reposting things online about how he hates hearing about a bf and he doesn’t want his friends bringing their bfs around him and it’s tacky. 

For context I’m F20 my best friend is M18, I see my bf M22 about once a week. I’m sometimes on my phone texting around my best friend because my bf has a time consuming job so we do try and talk at nights or mornings which happens to be when my best friend is asleep but sometimes I do text my bf throughout the day for check ins. 

While on the other hand my best friend is in a long distance relationship and is non stop on the phone or calls or anything actively ignoring me in the room. Just always on his phone non stop. I’ve let it slide because I know his partner brings him so much joy even though trying to speak to him it’s always about a fight they had or whatever.

The complaining started right after we spent 4 days (only during the day for a few hours) with my bf and my best friends other friends, at a convention. 

When I say I’m going to see him I get eye rolls and overhear him complaining to his part er on the phone, his mom tells me to be basically more mindful of my friend, ect. This caused me to get defensive with his mom and ask why they make it sound like I’m bringing my bf over every day, blowing off plans, and constantly ignoring my best friend and his mom just said that’s between me and my friend. When asking him he just literally ignored me point blank and I’ve been quietly stewing about it. 

 I’ve spent a lot of time going out of my way to make my best friend know I’m there and caring and present when we hang out. I’m there for all his relationships issues and actively ask about his relationship because I know his partner makes him happy. I’m wondering what I can change to make him feel more seen and in touch with our friendship but it honestly hurts seeing him start reposting things online talking about leave your man at home no one wants him around and other things like that.

1,1csb52z,AITA for promising I wouldn't ignore someone and doing exactly that?,"Hi, I am 18F and he is 24M. I met this guy in January 2024. I went to a park with my friends and he was there, he looked at me for a while and then came to talk to me. I confess that I didn't find him very attractive, but he was very kind and polite, he introduced himself, asked my name and we had a small talk. I think he got a little nervous and left without asking for my number and I was also embarrassed to ask for his.

Over the months I went to that park a few times with my friends, but I forgot about it. Once, after about 4 months I went to that park again and he was there again and this time he didn't miss the opportunity, as soon as he saw me he asked for my number and I gave it, because even though I didn't find him very attractive, I thought it was unfair to judge him by his appearance.

We talked for a few weeks, but I felt weird because I had never dated someone that older than me and at the time, NO ONE asked for number. Without counting him, only one guy asked for my number in my entire life.

With each passing day I felt more strange, he seemed to have created some admiration for me, he had praised me a few times, where I even thanked him and tried to reciprocate, but I couldn't feel the same way about him, especially because inside me I didn't seem accepting the idea of liking someone at the moment.

At first I felt like it was wrong to not like him when he wasn't doing anything wrong, but after I understood that it was ok to not like someone, I wrote him a message and I was completely honest. I said I wasn't feeling good in that situation because I wasn't mentally available for a relationship and I apologized for giving my number only to later say I was unavailable, but I explained saying that when we started talking, I thought I was available, but I wasn't. .

He said he understood and was really nice to me even though I felt like an asshole inside. In that conversation, I promised that there wouldn't be a bad atmosphere between us, I said that when we saw each other again I would talk to him normally.

Turns out I couldn't. We met about 2 times after that because we went to basically the same places, he tried to make some contact with me, but I felt so ashamed to talk to him, so ashamed that I ran away from him.

In my view, I was the confused girl who hurt the guys she talked to, so I felt ashamed to face him.

After that, the third time we met, he also started ignoring me, I feel like I deserved it, am I the asshole?",No A-holes here,2024-05-15,"AITA for promising I wouldn't ignore someone and doing exactly that?

2,1csb0s0,AITA for telling my mom how I feel? ,"So I'm gonna start this off with saying I suck at explaining how I feel in posts and well I have a hard time explaining anything anywhere so if what I say doesn't make sense in some parts I do apologize. Hi, my name's Cj I'm a soon to be 26 (may 22nd aye, only eight days away from posting this) male who just kind of had a blown up at my mom but no yelling conversation with my mom. My mom (soon to be 49) had me as a bit of an accident, her and my dad (who lives in Vegas) had ""one last go"" before my mom moved back to Wisconsin and then found out she was pregnant with me a few months later. Growing up she always told my dad didn't want anything to do with me, was an alcoholic, drug addict and other horrible things so she never let me talk to him or let him come to Wisconsin to see me or us go out to Vegas to meet him at all (I never met him or talked to him). After he passed away in 2011 I started talking to his side of the family like my aunts, uncles and grandma. A year or so after talking to them I asked them if my dad ever talked about me to them or how he wanted to see me, they told me that he loved me so much and was trying to do everything he could to see me and meet me. A couple years ago I asked my aunt about my dad being an alcoholic and all that, my aunt said my dad never touched the stuff, only drug he did was a bit of weed every now and then, no alcohol or hard drugs. When I found that out I was heartbroken and I kind of kept it inside of how I felt for a few months, when I confronted her about her lies she denied ever saying anything like that but my grandparents, uncle and other family members all tell me that she said all those bad things about him all the time. My dad from when I was born to when he died, tried so hard to meet me and spend time with me but my mom denied him every time. Denied me my father and made up lies about him to make me think he was a bad man but he was the complete opposite. 

That's one of the things I blew up at her about, here's the others. When I was about 4 or 5 years old my mom married  my ex step dad (they divorced when I was 10) and they had my two younger sisters (that information will come into play soon). For the years my mom was married to, let's call him C, C abused me mentally and physically but that's it. She never once defended after he did those things except for maybe a couple times in the beginning. Now if my sisters (one who is 6 years younger than me and the other is 8 years younger than me) had been treated even an ounce badly she would defend them right away. Fast forward to the present, I left my mom to live with my grandparents at the age of 10 (right after their divorce) when they got legal custody of me cause I was dealing with a lot of mental stuff kids that age should never deal with (depression, PTSD and more),I included that part of moving in with my grandparents cause it was at that time she never told me she loves me, appreciates me or anything since then. I always had contact with her, visited her dozens of times a month with my grandparents, stayed with her, lived with her for a year back in 2021-2022 after I got out of the mental hospital. I have done so much for her, after my dad died I started getting social security death benefits (I believe that's what it is called I'm not to sure) monthly but since I was still young my mom was getting them, I didn't get a PENNY from those which were supposed to go to me and my care cause she was using it all on herself for rent when I didn't even live with her, random bull crap and more. When I was able to open my own bank account when I was 16 with the help of my grandparents I started getting those checks myself. When that happened she went off the handle and blamed me for her possibly getting kicked out of her place, not being able to afford food and other things when she had a great paying job that she was able to more than support herself and my two sisters as a single mom. Ever since then my mom constantly guilt trips me into helping her out with money (she makes almost twice as much as I do) for bills and food, I used to do it every time and she never thanked me for it, said she loved me for doing it or anything. I've recently stopped doing it but she still brings up in random phone conversations or texts quite literally out of thin air (we can be talking about random things like the weather) like saying ""yeah I don't think I can afford the electric bill this month cause my whole paycheck went to rent and I don't even think I can get groceries"" but yet she can afford getting more random crafts she'll lose interest in  in a matter of days, new bags, water bottles and more. 

Okay sorry for the long winded explanation, this all boiled up to yesterday (day after mother's day) when she posted stuff about what my sisters got her for mother's day, nothing about what I got her even though I spent $100+ on her and not even a thanks or I love you for it. I called her and asked why she didn't include what I got her she simply said ""I don't know"" and for some reason that set me off to where I spent about 25 minutes telling her how she has made me feel like a son she never wanted and doesn't want by saying she kept me from my dad for no reason, she let the abuse happen, she drains me of my money, doesn't say I love you, makes everything about her like when my grandma died, how she hurts me with all the bad stuff she's done to me, talks bad about me behind my back (I know this cause my sisters tell me when she does when she talks to them and vice versa for me to them), doesn't care if I died barley able to get a coherent sentence together cause I'm choking on tears. All she had to say was ""so you just think I'm a horrible mother? Should I just go die in a hole then? Would that make you feel better?"". When she said that I just hung up the phone and cried till I had to go to work, I work with kids so I had to put on a strong face. We haven't talked since then and I don't know how long it will be till We do..... So AITA for finally letting her know how I feel about what she's done/does to me?

He borrowed about $100 from me about a year back, to pay to go clubbing or whatever. Dude texted me while I was pulling a 16 hour night shift, I told him to pay me back within a month and transferred over the money. I asked for my money back exactly a month later, he says he has no money. Months go by and I stopped asking for my money back as it's a lost cause. 

He's the type of dude who can't save money at all, he would get $500 from his dad and blow it within a day or two. I simply refused giving him any more ""loans"". 

Now last week he texts me and asks for $1,500 loan and promised to pay me back in installments. Told me he would pay me half of the money he gets from his dad until debt is paid. He wanted the money for a new iPhone. I told him literally every mobile carriers offers 0% & $0 down contracts, but his credit is so bad that he can't even get qualified for that. 

So I told him that I would loan him $1,500 if he paid me back the $100 he owed me first. Of course, I'm not a fool and had no intentions of even lending him a dollar. He agrees and transfers me $100. I get a request of $1,500 from him the next day. I decline and tell him that I'm not going to loan him a dime forever. I told him to get his act together. Either stop blowing your money or get a job.

I only get 4.5 days of vacation time a year, and really didn't want to call off. I called my mom to ask her if she could reschedule the appointment. She flipped out on me, saying I was selfish, and didnt care about herself. Started guilt tripping me about how I'm not taking care of her, and how she's gonna end up alone. 

Finally she calls the doctors, and they can't re-schedule. I'm frusterated because she could take an uber to and from, but still insists that I should do it because I owe her for everything she's done for me growing up. 

We don't have a good relationship at all, and she's starting to get all these health problems suddenly in the last year from her untreated diabetes (she's only 50 and has almost no retirement savings). 

Well the truth is, I really don't feel like taking care of her in the future. I'm her only child, only family, and she has one other friend to speak of. My mother really is a lonely person, and I don't know what she's gonna do when she goes blind from the diabetes. (Which is what she currently has trouble with)

She hates it, but enjoys hearing the drama and making cookies and all the tips she gets for being nice. So after work she likes to check on the peppers, fruits, and veggies. On her weekends (thurs & fri) shes been taking it upon herself to deweed the garden. Her fiance said he felt hurt by this.

Their disagreement starts here, he says that the weed pulling was his project to begin with, and when she does it without him, it hurts his feelings. He wants to pull weeds with her, he spends all day working at the house (more physical labor) and would like to spend her weekends with her relaxing, and they can weed pull when its sunny, or before she goes to work (she leaves for work at 1pm)

My mom says that its her weekend and she should get to choose what she wants to do on her weekend, she didnt even listen to his argument, it was clear she was just waiting to respond. After he left to take a nap to subside his aggressive feelings, my mom turns to my sister and I and asks us what we think.

My sister does her usual mediation tactic to ""find a middle ground"" and not giving her opinion, but just trying to make both sides happy. I said ""You should apologize"" and she blew up on me asking ""why should i have to? its MY day off!""
""because it was his project first, and youre taking it over.""

She didnt apologize, and has been sleeping on the couch instead of their shared bed. She won't talk to her fiance or me, just my sister and brother

7,1csa2ui,AITA for not feeling comfortable telling my mother I’ve had mental health issues,"26M

My family is going through a very traumatic time. My dad kind of lost his mind and turned incredibly abusive towards everyone especially my mother. My mom left the house and my dad stayed until the divorce was finalized. He then disappeared and left the house in horrendous condition. It’s been a long long time of trying to deal with this situation and get everything back together and it’s been very tough on everyone.

Unfortunately my girlfriend has had to deal with some of this by extent because it’s taken a toll on me. I feel very bad about this and I’ve been trying my best to keep everything together but I’ve also had to help my mom out a lot because it’s been extremely hard on her and, while I have two younger siblings, one is autistic and the other lives out of state. 

My girlfriend has said that I need to set boundaries with my family because this is a lot for me and that is true. But I have also tried to explain to her that, because of the fact that there’s only so much my other siblings can do, I have to do what I can to help my mom. She’s upset that I don’t force my siblings to do more and she doesn’t seem to understand that there’s a lot of stuff they just cannot do.

She’s obviously noticed that this has been hard on me but I’ve also confided in her and let her know that I’ve had some feelings of depression and panic attacks at some points. Nothing too serious as I’ve had these symptoms before my family issues but I still wanted to let her know. I also told her that I didn’t want my family to know because they have enough going on and they don’t need another thing to worry about. I have no problem restricting what I can do to help if I can’t do something because of these issues.

Now it’s at a point where my girlfriend is saying that if I don’t tell my mom that I’m depressed and I have panic attacks that she doesn’t want to be in this relationship anymore. I feel horrible but I just don’t see how that will help anything because I already have been able to limit what I do to help when I’m getting overwhelmed. It’s just a tough situation regardless and it’s unfortunate.

8,1csa10i,AITA for watching a movie with my boyfriend in the apartment after my roommate went through a bad breakup?,"My roommate (Belle, 19f) and I (19f) have been at each others throats for as long as we have lived together, but recently it got worse when her boyfriend (22m), Mile, was revealed to be not only a cheater but a predator who takes photos of women at his place of work. Before this incident, Belle and I had not spoken for month and she was overtly hostile - going as far as inviting over her boyfriend to spend the night when she knew I could not stand him.  
 When they broke up, she apologized for her behavior and asked for my friendship back. For as long as Belle and Mike have been together I have not liked him. 

On the night of my birthday she allowed him to spend the night without asking me, as they were both too drunk to drive when she brought up the question (we had previously discussed and agreed that all overnight guests should be cleared with whoever was home). i couldnt say no due to their state of intoxication. they proceeded to loudly have sex that could be heard in all the apartment. I asked he not spend the night after that, but was fine with day visits. She constantly asked, so I agreed on the condition that communal spaces weren’t violated. 

Recently she and him broke up, after she found out that he was cheating in a variety of ways and taking photos of women and of her while he was working and they first met (they were coworkers, she was underage at the time). She knew he was a sex addict, but had not thought it would lead to him cheating. 

She was devastated, understandably, and banned men from the apartment for a while and I obliged her for a few weeks. I now have a boyfriend  (19 m) who comes over to watch movies and hang out, never violating common areas or spending the night if she is over.

 She recently got back together with him and has kept the banning of all men from the apartment yet spends nights at Mikes place.

She recently left for a trip without informing me and when I saw she was back in the state I gave her a heads up about the fact that my boyfriend was going to stay over, as she had not told me to expect her back. She accused me of violating her boundaries and when I mentioned the past violation of mine she told me that she was currently going through a tough time in her life.

 I’ve asked her and she said there was nothing against my boyfriend specifically it’s all men.

He's never tried to build a relationship beyond throwing money at me and I've accepted that we'll never be close. My mom got married when I was 2. My stepdad has three kids (21M, 18F, and 17M) and they have four kids together (14M, 11M, 9F, and 6M). My mom doesn't work so money is tight sometimes. My mom is like my stepsiblings' real mom. Their dad has never been like my real dad. After they got married, they focused on creating their new life together and I didn't fit in their perfect family.

My stepsister and I were never able to build a relationship. When we were little, my dad would buy me better toys and sometimes I let SS play with me, but she would break or steal my things so I started to keep my stuff from my dad hidden. We were both too young to know better. Even as we got older, we never got closer. My mom prioritized my stepsiblings in very obvious ways and I was jealous of that.  SS is jealous of the things my dad bought me. I've always had lots of new clothes, electronics, and makeup while she doesn't. She also has two loving parents while I have none. Our biggest fight was when we turned 16, my dad got me a car and threw me a big party. She said some very hurtful things. I now try to avoid her.

Like most people, I see him as a kind, quiet guy with a good heart who can be socially awkward, even slow at times.   


From the time I got hired at this place (and met this guy) to early 2020 when the pandemic hit, the two of us had hung out for a total of 5-6 times to grab a few drinks, mostly after work. 5-6 occasions of a few drinks in a span of 2.5 years, talking mostly about politics or people at work. No personal or emotional sharing whatsoever. No lunch together at work either, just casual talk here and there. In the past 8 years, he gave me a few rides home (<10) after work. After the pandemic and especially last year, we did try to hang out a few times but never got around to it. Not a big deal, even felt relieved as his conversation has gotten noticeably dull or so I began to feel that way at this point.   


I had to take a long leave of absence this fall due to an accident & this guy was one of the few people from work who regularly checked in on me. I made the effort to let him know that I appreciated it. He would call or txt me occasionally, ask if I need anything and offer to take me outside for some fresh air, as I was mostly resting at home due to my injury. The only favor I asked was grabbing a few things from my office and drop them off at his convenience. He made a terrible mess, brought some of my stuff in pretty damaged condition but no surprises there, he can get clumsy at times, so I didn’t say anything. Offered him some tea, about half an hour later, he was gone. This was the first (& last) time he got into my apartment. I don’t have people from work come over to my place, this was an exception due to my injury. Few hours later, I noticed he’d taken my thrash out when leaving, without letting me know. Completely unnecessary since my building has a maintenance guy who takes care of that and I had placed my thrash by my unit door that afternoon for the maintenance guy to pick it up later. Common practice here.  


Since his visit, this guy txt’ed me at 8AM on weekends with single liners like “are you back on your feet?” or “how is your recovery going?” Two weeks ago, he called and mentioned within minutes that he was close to my street. I made nothing of it and casually carried on, he then said he was near my building. At this point I noticed the absence of ambient sounds like traffic noise etc., thinking he probably parked somewhere, possibly in front of my building. Didn’t react, tried to carry the conversation until he interrupted me “Want me to come upstairs?” in a really weird excited tone. I got quite uncomfortable, pretended I didn’t hear it and rushed to finish the call. Before he hung up he said  “I will come by” which got me creeped out. Since then he txt’ed me a few times and gave me a call yesterday. Didn’t write back, didn’t take his call. I feel somewhat forced into a connection that was never there.

13,1cs9j1h,AITA for not saying “hi” to my friend’s husband in the waiting room at the gynecologist?,"This is my third visit in two months to the gyno after an abnormal pap and needing to minor but painful treatment. I’ve been dreading this  appointment so I’ve been in self-care mode - took the week off work (self-employed), wore sweats/no makeup (rare for me), and flew my best friend out as a support (my husband currently has a broken foot). My friend offered to come into the hospital with me, but I suggested she hang out in the cafe nearby and I could text her when I was ready to be picked up. 

As I was sitting in the waiting room kind of panicking about the procedure (I hate pain), I noticed a man across the room looking at his phone.

I just wasn’t in the mood to say hello to someone I barely knew with all that was on my mind. I could tell he looked at me a few times but I ignored him. When I was finally called in, I had to pass him and he said “I knew it was you! Hi! Lindsey is here too!” I ignored him getting through the doors with the nurse as fast as possible. 

A few hours later as I’m settling into recovering at home, I got a text from my friend Lindsey asking why I didn’t say hi back to her husband.

14,1cs9eut,AITA For wanting to call out my ex-boyfriend's weird online behavior?,"A few years ago, I met a guy at a convention in Phoenix who did cosplays similar to my cosplays. We got along well and eventually began to have more intimate experiences together, although he insisted it was ""just friendly"". Whether kissing and making out is ""platonic"" or not is up to the person doing it, I suppose. Anyways, we broke up a few months after meeting and the whole experience really traumatized me for a while. He had sent his friends after me and all that. Normal teenager online drama. I avoided him at all costs for a good year or two until I started pursuing cosplay as a bigger thing. I discovered that he had a big following for his cosplay on TikTok and Instagram. He followed my group's Instagram account and I realized it probably wasn't worth avoiding anymore. 
That was when I began noticing strange behavior between him (who is now an adult) and a 16 year old non-binary fan artist. They would publicly flirt in the comments of posts, post about how much they love each other on Instagram stories, and for a brief period of time they publicly roleplayed pregnancy on Instagram. I watched all of this go down over the course of several months and screenshotted everything even remotely concerning. 
I am now also an adult and currently in a happy relationship with my boyfriend. I shouldn't be so concerned with my ex-boyfriend's behavior, right? But.. this guy is showing some weird signs of possibly grooming a minor and it's getting to be really weird now. 
I want to come out publicly about it, but I know I can't because of my status and my career at the moment. So instead, I've spoken privately to a few people associated with the ex-boyfriend and they've all said that it's weird, but I should probably stop looking at it.

My Dad filed for divorce during the pandemic, and all of us (myself, dad and 2 adult siblings) are NC with her. Every event or holiday, my mother would make a bunch of ""woe is me"" posts on Instagram. For years, we all just ignored it and blocked anyone who sent us DMs, telling us to ""forgive and forget"".

Last week was my younger sister's 21st Birthday, and our mother took to Instagram with more posts saying how my sister ""robbed her"" of being able to celebrate, and the fact that none of her kids invited her means that were all ""ungrateful"".

Your ungrateful child remembers."" After that, I turned my phone off and went back to celebrating with my family.

Once the festivities died down, we all turned off Do Not Disturb and saw that there were dozens of DMs from our mother and various people (who we assume are her friends) making wild accusations about me, saying that my dad put me up to it, etc etc. Everyone turned to me, asking what the hell I did, and after I explained it, my dad told me that I should've stayed silent to keep the peace.

16,1cs93xk,AITA for not picking up calls or wanting to talk to her anymore ,"I think I know I am but here’s the story. 
2 years ago my best friend asked me if I could help a friend of hers with some relationship problems and family law issues.   I agreed as I’m happy to help anyone who needs anything and if I can offer advice I don’t t have an issue.  I used to work in a legal aid office so have a bit of knowledge but am not a lawyer. 
This 27 year old female has literally called me everyday for the past 2 years - she has a 2 year old son.  Initially I spoke to her for about 2 hours a day and gave her information and signposted her to people and places.  I soon figured out she didn’t really follow my advice and ended up getting deeper into problems with the ex and the family law courts. She basically did the opposite to what I advised or what her lawyer said.  For a whole year and a half I spoke to her almost every day but then it started to get a bit overwhelming for me. I could not talk to her hashing the same things over and over again. She’d call really early in the morning or late at night and expect to be listened to. If she had a an argument or pick up or drop off went bad she expected me to pick up so she could talk through her feelings. Regardless of me being at work or at home or even if I was out. Most often she would be angry upset and mad at the ex or whoever.  For the past 6 months I have just communicated by text and the odd 15 minute phone call.  She has now spoken to my best friend and said that I’m not being supportive enough to her and my best friend is annoyed with me. 

At the time I thought this girl she referred to was a close friend but since then I have found out they are not very close and only mutual friends. So I don’t get why my best friend is really that upset with me. I spoke to the girl and said I’m going through some issues of my own ( which I am)
And I need time to get over this and need to keep some time for myself and my family. 
She is now saying that I knew she didn’t have any other female friends and that I shouldn’t have encouraged her to talk to me because now she needs to find someone else and start at the beginning again. She made it sound like I was  her shrink and I was making her start therapy or something.  I have previously encouraged her to reach out for mental health support but she said she didn’t need it.  She has parents and siblings who in my opinion have supported her so much and she often says horrible things about them which I think is unfair.  She called me yesterday and I didn’t pick up, it was like 5am and it broke my sleep and I was totally pissed off as I couldn’t get back to sleep again. My best friend thinks I should carry on being supportive but right now I just haven’t got it in me anymore.

19,1cs8wq0,AITA for not wanting to spend time with my widowed dad’s girlfriend,"About a year ago, my mom passed away suddenly and unexpectedly.

My mom always joked that my dad would bring a date to her funeral and sure enough, a female “friend” showed up to sit with him. It became obvious over the following weeks and months that they were in a relationship, although he tried to deny this for a long time. I actually suspect that they were involved before my mom passed away, as my dad has a history of affairs, the girlfriend has a history of affairs with other married men, and she had given him some expensive tools that she allegedly didn’t need anymore in years leading up to my mom’s passing. My dad doesn’t know that I suspect this and I haven’t said anything to him about it.

My dad almost immediately started bringing the girlfriend to public events like sports games and school events for my child and nieces/nephews. I expressed to my dad several times that while it was his choice to move on when he was ready, I personally was not ready to have a relationship with the girlfriend. At times, he will act understanding about this and then will continue to message about when we can all get together and when she can have contact with my child.

Just last weekend, I reiterated to him that I wasn’t ready for that level of contact and did not want her spending time with my child. Today, I learned that he had the girlfriend at his home without my permission while my child was there and knowing that I objected to this. I told him that it was not acceptable to have ignored my wishes. He is angry at me saying I am being ridiculous.

AITA?

  
ETA: Someone had a question about this, so wanted to add. My parents, specifically my mom, had provided routine childcare for my child since birth, as they were both retired and thought child should be with them vs. in daycare. 

Since my mom‘s passing I have done my best to make other childcare arrangements for my child whenever possible. There are a few times a month that I may ask him to pick her up from school or spend a few hours with my child until I’m back in town from work. He claims to want to do this and complains if/when he feels he hasn’t had enough time with her lately.

The girlfriend doesn’t live with him and they spend time together at her home when they get together, so I think it isn’t a big ask for her not to be around during the limited time he’s with the child.

21,1cs7w3z,AITA for not forgiving my friend's ex.,"A few months ago during winter break of my 3rd year, my friend's ex cheated on him with another guy. My friend was destroyed and he was depressed for weeks after this happened. Despite all of this, he never fully cut her off. Now they are on strong talking terms again and are even back to being friends. I was also friends with his ex before this all happened but since then I sort of tapped out of the friendship because I lost all respect for this woman. There is nothing I hate more than people who cheat, in my opinion its one of the most disgusting things someone can do. This means that as a third party to this rekindled friendship between my friend and his ex, it has been a weird and conflicting experience. Even though she is still actively with this other guy, she is still extremely intimate with my friend, touching him and using pet names. I have made sure that he is comfortable with this numerous times and every single time he says that while he doesn't love it, it makes his ex happy so he doesn't mind. I kind of understand this because the guy she is currently with is quite toxic but that also isn’t his problem. This dynamic has gone on for months at this point and I have been bottling up more and more resentment towards this woman. I hate how she is using my friend as nothing but a comfort toy and I hate how he is just letting this happen to him. It got to the point where I couldn't hold it in anymore and I snapped. She was doing her usual stuff with my friend being intimate, saying I love you when I just flat out told her that she was lying. I told her that this whole dynamic was really annoying and that I hated her presence, I hated how she was using and treating my friend. She got defensive and tried to say that my friend was completely fine with what was happening and regardless of whether or not he was I didn't care. I was so done with her bullshit.

She stopped talking to me after that which doesn't bother me but what has me concerned is that my friend has also changed his behaviour towards me. Lately, he has seemed a lot more cold and distant and I feel it has to do with what I said. His ex thinks that it's stupid that I'm still so mad at her because this happened so long ago and that she didn't cheat on me. She doesn't think I should be so angry and that it's not my place to ""forgive"" in this situation.

Maybe its not my place to forgive, but thinking about what she did to him and how it made my friend feel makes me furious. I can't be friends with someone who has done something like that. Despite being his ride or die, it almost feels as though he's about to choose being friends with his ex over me. I really don't want to lose this guy but it really seems like he's about to choose her over me. I still want to maintain the close bond I have with my friend but I feel like I won't be able to do that unless I move on and make up with this girl. I’m not gonna make him pick and choose but I will never forgive this girl for what she did.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-15,"AITA for not forgiving my friend's ex. A few months ago during winter break of my 3rd year, my friend's ex cheated on him with another guy. My friend was destroyed and he was depressed for weeks after this happened. Despite all of this, he never fully cut her off. Now they are on strong talking terms again and are even back to being friends. I was also friends with his ex before this all happened but since then I sort of tapped out of the friendship because I lost all respect for this woman. There is nothing I hate more than people who cheat, in my opinion its one of the most disgusting things someone can do. This means that as a third party to this rekindled friendship between my friend and his ex, it has been a weird and conflicting experience. Even though she is still actively with this other guy, she is still extremely intimate with my friend, touching him and using pet names. I have made sure that he is comfortable with this numerous times and every single time he says that while he doesn't love it, it makes his ex happy so he doesn't mind. I kind of understand this because the guy she is currently with is quite toxic but that also isn’t his problem. This dynamic has gone on for months at this point and I have been bottling up more and more resentment towards this woman. I hate how she is using my friend as nothing but a comfort toy and I hate how he is just letting this happen to him. It got to the point where I couldn't hold it in anymore and I snapped.

I've been buying my siblings food such as fast food or groceries that I cook since my parents get home pretty late, which I understand cause they have to work to support the family too.

A week ago, I told my sister that she has to be able to buy herself food that she wants to eat because she has the opportunity to earn the money and that I won't always be there to buy her stuff. I have also told her that one day she gotta buy food for me since I pay for everything, but I don't mind if she doesn't. 

So yesterday, I bought my siblings Raising Canes cause my sister wanted it. I tell my sister that she has to pay for it cause I can't pay for it everytime. She says yeah and when I got home, she wouldn't give the money unless I told her I'm going to eat it since I payed for it.

25,1cs78m3,AITA for letting my dog go to the bathroom on my neighbors yard. ,"genuinely, i am sure if i am the asshole. 

so for a little context i live in a fairly crowded suburb of a large city, basically my neighborhood is four blocks of single family homes that are boarderline kissing eachother (i feel like this is important idk)

multiple times a day, i take my dog on a walk around the same four blocks. i walk on the sidewalk, and my dog walks next to me, but on the grass that is technically part of the front lawns. there is multiple family style unit. with the biggest most green lawn on the entire four block stretch ( 7' by 15' patch) my dog takes two fat dumps on that lawn every single day since the first day i had him( i have never left dog poop anywhere, i always pick it up) because of this, i have met everyone who ever lived in that building including the landlord. on the occasion that i met him, i was in the middle of picking up my dog's poop from the yard, he came over, thanked me for picking up my dogs poop and told me that if i wanted i could throw away my poop bags in their trash can, which i never did besides the day he offered. 

two weeks ago a new tenant moved into one of the units, and three times since the moved in my dog has been taking his nightly doodoo on their lawn, she agressively tells me that my dog cant step on the grass. there are a lot of dog owners in the neighborhood that ive met on my walks including the woman who lived in that unit up until she moved in. my dog is arguably the largest one. i have yet to mention to any of the dog owners in the neighborhood.

 i can understand the sentiment of not wanting a dog to poop essence on your lawn. i guess im looking for clarity about whether or not this good dogowner behavior? the first time this happened i was pretty pissed but after getting scolded for the third time in two weeks, i told her that when i had met her landlord all that time ago, he hadnt had a problem with it, but her argument was that she didnt care about that because shes the one who lives there now (it's technically three apartments but yes). i get that argument too. 

now ive half heartedly attempted to have my dog avoid that specific lawn but he is fairly confused why we are now avoiding prime poop territory. if i decide to change this dog owner bevahior, i might have to start talking him on a new walk route entirely.

I’ve only flown once years ago so I thought I could give her the money for my half and she would buy them. I periodically asked about the tickets and sent her a video form Sanderson about the flights. It’s obvious that she didn’t watch it.

My friend asked me to buy her, her ticket and she would Venmo me the money. I agreed and it was an absolute shit show. All 7500 tickets sold out in 50 minutes.

With that being said picking up his friend and dropping him off all the time was getting out of hand. My husband would pick him up after work (which was out of the way) and drop him off any time after midnight. I ask our friend jokingly but seriously at the same time when he planned on getting his license. At the time he said he had an appointment to get it in a couple months. So i went with it and believed him. Then baby was born and the picking up and dropping off died down. Then it picked up again and got aggravating as i needed help with bed time or feedings or even just little things. I brushed it off thinking it would die down again but it didn’t.

He came over when he should have been at his appointment and said he had to cancel his he didn’t practice driving. Every time he had an appointment it’s been excuse after excuse. He even pulled the “i don’t have a car” excuse when there’s 4 cars his family has that he can borrow. I’ve told him he can take one of our cars.We didn’t mind since of course we have insurance and we both drive heavy duty trucks. However he is always making an excuse whenever we try to help. It’s coming to a point where i don’t want him around anymore because his negativity and lack of motivation is draining. What really sparked my anger was when he asked us to pick him up so my husband and him can go golf and i said that was fine since we were out and about already, but after golf he asked to home and an hour later asked to be picked up to come back over to our house then dropped off back home before midnight. That made me so annoyed since by that time it was time to get out baby to sleep and do out bedtime routine. I’m due soon and I’m going to need more help than ever with 2 under 2. My husband doesn’t see a problem with this and i think it’s due to them being friends for so long but i just want his friend to have some independence and not rely on us all the time especially now that we are a growing family and need to concern ourselves with our babies. AITA??",Not the A-hole,2024-05-15,"AITA for wanting our friend to get his license? I (f27) and my husband (m26) have a friend (m26) who, we consider more family than a friend, won’t get his license.This normally wouldn’t brother me but it has gotten worse as time has gone on. It start when my husband and i found out we were pregnant My baby wanted to come way too early so we were constantly worried that i would end up having her at any given moment. With that being said picking up his friend and dropping him off all the time was getting out of hand. My husband would pick him up after work (which was out of the way) and drop him off any time after midnight. I ask our friend jokingly but seriously at the same time when he planned on getting his license. At the time he said he had an appointment to get it in a couple months. So i went with it and believed him. Then baby was born and the picking up and dropping off died down. Then it picked up again and got aggravating as i needed help with bed time or feedings or even just little things. I brushed it off thinking it would die down again but it didn’t.

29,1csz1ml,AITA for asking my partner to help with our baby at night? ,"My partner (M) and I (F) (both 26) have an 8 month old baby. We are both first time parents and got pregnant with our accidental miracle quite early in our relationship but just felt it was right. We also own a house and dogs together. 
From 2 weeks old to around 5 months, I got up for our baby every single night. My partner had the attitude that he worked and I didn’t so it was my responsibility. We were quite lucky as our baby is a relatively good sleeper, just the usual every 3 hour wake ups as a new born and then seemed to get better and better with age.
We have hit a few regressions as expected and when that happened I had enough of doing it on my own. I started getting my partner to help out and this has just caused fight after fight. His usual argument is that all I would do is look after the baby and sit around all day while he was at work. Which isn’t true, I look after our baby, take him to his weekly activities, clean the whole house myself, look after the pets and cook all meals. I see it as we both have hard jobs. 
I am now also back at work myself, I do an office job while my partner does have a more physical job yet not quite a trade. 

My partner recently went away for work interstate. I had our baby for 5 nights on my own which also ended up being some of our hardest nights with his sleep. I was so looking forward to my partner coming home to help out, and of course I just missed him in general. 

Once my partner got him he said he was exhausted, which I understand as he worked hard while he was away. He also stated he went to the pub each night he was away and had amazing sleeps which I’m happy he got to do! I told him how hard our nights were and he just kind of brushed it off. 
Our baby ended up having another awful night that night, I got up initially to deal with it but was struggling so asked my partner to have a turn. 
He immediately started yelling at me, that I have no respect, that he works and I should deal with it because I don’t do anything etc. he called me a fucking moron amongst other things. 
He also essentially shouts at our baby when he gets frustrated about the lack of sleep. I always go to step in at this point and he brushes me off. 

Eventually I did take over and stayed up for 2 hours trying to settle our baby. My partner heard me crying in the room but still doesn’t offer to help. It just leaves me feeling so alone. 
He preaches that we are a team but anytime it comes to helping out at night, I’m on my own. 

I always think maybe tonight will be the night he will just help without a fight but I always end up regretting asking. It’s miserable to know I can’t rely on the person I thought I could trust the most.

30,1csyvng,AITA for giving my Mom stern advice?,"My (28, female) parents have a very interesting relationship. One of those kinds of relationships where I’d say “alright” and move on uncaring if they broke up.

My Mom is in remission from cancer for bout 3 months now and my Dad was meaner than ever during her treatment. I was essentially her life partner during this time. She’s even joked about this to people saying I was basically her “husband”... My Dad did not attend even 1 treatment with her. I went to almost every single one.

My Dad is a typical boomer man. He thinks just because he “works and provides” that about covers it for his fathering and romantic partnership roles. He belittles her and does things to purposely make her frustrated or anxious. He is the worst utilizer of weaponized incompetence ever. It’s just so blatant and obvious. I just have to laugh sometimes. He never taught me anything as a father-figure. I learned everything I don’t want to do or be as a parent from him. 

Anyways, I think he has dragged my Mom down with him. He drinks a lot and sits on his ass for most the time he isn’t at work. He doesn’t do anything to help her and she just goes along with it. She drinks with him, even though she’s on a bunch of medication still (that prooooobably shouldn’t be taken with alcohol). She lazes around the house with him… which bothers me the most for some reason. She’s still understandably extremely emotionally fragile from having cancer and dealing with this life or death situation… and she has had a lifelong issue with anxiety. 

So, I keep confronting her about the drinking and these issues at larger, and she gets mad at me, always saying something along the lines of “I am an adult that can my make own decisions”. I tell her she needs a hobby or to travel alone and she asks “what about your Dad?” He always comes first but who is prioritizing her? I just wish she would put herself FRIST in her own life. Me making these statements always ends in an argument between us. 

She told me during her treatment that she wants to change her lifestyle (go to therapy, take some classes at our local community college, etc), but I’m not sure she really wants to. I think my Dad is holding her back on all fronts, but I know it’s her decision in the end. I can’t force her to change her life. I know she has to want it.

All in all, I just feel helpless and don’t know what to do. I’m in my late 20s and live with my parents as many people have to due to the financial burden of living in America (LOL). But I am saving up to move out so I can remove myself from this situation. I love and appreciate them as parents and I know it’s between the two of them, but it’s hard to not insert myself because they have historically involved me in their issues. I’m worried that when I move out I’ll have to go no-contact for some time just cause it’s all too much sometimes. How can I set boundaries, help them and move on with my own life all the same time?

31,1csyud4,AITA?? My kind of threw me into the middle of her and a guy ,"So my best friend met this guy at a concert 6 months ago and has been in contact with him since then. They're not serious at all, she talks to other guys, he goes out with other girls (he's also significantly older than her) and he's in the modeling business. She's seen him 3 times in person (at the concert being the first time) and then twice in his town accompanied by a friend (the third time being with me but I'll get to that in a second). After she posted a picture of her and I and tagged me, he followed me and I sent her a screenshot of it.  To my surprise, she told me I should text him and flirt with him. I asked her why and she just said because it would be funny. So I did, and not too long after the three of us pulled an all nighter on FaceTime where he was very obviously flirting with me. She didn't seem to mind it at all so I just went along with it. Him and I had an ongoing conversation over text the day following. I asked her if she thought the situation was weird and she said not at all, I do my thing and she does hers and I agreed. So I kept conversing with him and her and I would talk every day. A couple days later, she asked me how often I talk to him and I told her we just had an ongoing conversation for a day. I then again asked her if it was weird and she said no but then said it was as if she was talking to the guy I was ""talking"" to (which I honestly wouldn't have cared). And I didn't want to argue with her so I told her I understand and I would stop talking to him if she wanted me to. So I did, even though he kept sending me messages and calling me I would ignore it. Until Saturday, her and I went to his town and she told me I should call him and see if we can come over. So I did, we went to his place, talked, then shortly him, his roommate, her and I went out. During the time we were all out, he kept flirting with me in front of her and kept asking me to kiss him but I didn't give in. I was very confused. Her and I FaceTimed the next day and talked about that Saturday and I told her about him flirting and wanting to kiss me and she just brushed over it (didn't really say anything about it) and I told her I was confused at what his intentions were.

34,1csyqfu,AITA - For siding with my sister after she photoshopped my cousin in wedding photo?,"Okay, so I have a cousin who's a little bit of a wild child in my very vanilla family. 

When we were kids, we hung out a lot even though there was an age-gap. As a kid, I thought she was so cool. But now as an adult I'm like... wait, why was a 16 year old besties with a 10 year old?

Anyway, the issue came a few years ago when I was 16 and she was 22.

My older sister had a wedding and my cousin balked at what everyone was meant to wear (pastels for girls as it was a spring wedding). Suits for the boys. I also hated the rules because I hated everything girly. My little rebellion was to wear black leggings under my lavender dress

My cousin's was to dye her chin length hair purple, moose it into a swoop, wear a purple vest suit with a yellow tie, and then wear white-pale foundation and bright red lipstick. It was worst clash of colors ever.

Honestly... I don't remember a lot of fall out other than a lot of side-eye. At the time I was disappointed it didn't cause a stir, but now I realize how gracious my sister had been. She didn't make a scene and just let my cousin do her thing.

About 9 months ago, I was at my sister's house and saw a group wedding photo framed on a stairwell. Welp, my sister had done some pretty good photoshopping and color-shifted my cousin's suit and hair to black and made the makeup a natural tone. Because it was a group photo and the camera was pulled back, my cousin looked like a guy with a crappy haircut.

I didn't say anything but honestly, my sister had been just so mature and gracious about the whole thing. I'm embarrassed about my 16 year old self's thoughts about her wedding.

My cousin found out about the photoshop recently and has just been on a tear. She thinks the family is forcefully conforming her and were taking everything special from her. She wants to go limited contact with the family, and only contact them through me. 

I told her... look, I'm about the age you were then, and what you did back then was stupid, not funny. 

She argued back that I had laughed at the time. Which, I did. We sort of egged each other on, and though I knew she was going to dye her hair, I didn't know she was going to go full custome full of clashing colors. Though had I known, I may not have stopped her. I looked up to her so much and thought she was just awesome all around. 

Here's where I may be the asshole. I told her that I did laugh at the time, but now I'm older and realize it was messed up to dress like that for a very traditional wedding. That she made an ass of herself, and that my sister did her a favor by toning down the look in the pictures.

I guess that's made me the enemy now because I haven't heard from my cousin in weeks. 

This is so stupid to cut someone off over, but I know she feels like the odd one out in our very bland family. 

I don't know, internet. What do you think? Was I in the wrong? Should I reach out?

My older sister had a wedding and my cousin balked at what everyone was meant to wear (pastels for girls as it was a spring wedding). Suits for the boys. I also hated the rules because I hated everything girly. My little rebellion was to wear black leggings under my lavender dress

My cousin's was to dye her chin length hair purple, moose it into a swoop, wear a purple vest suit with a yellow tie, and then wear white-pale foundation and bright red lipstick. It was worst clash of colors ever.

Honestly... I don't remember a lot of fall out other than a lot of side-eye. At the time I was disappointed it didn't cause a stir, but now I realize how gracious my sister had been. She didn't make a scene and just let my cousin do her thing.

About 9 months ago, I was at my sister's house and saw a group wedding photo framed on a stairwell. Welp, my sister had done some pretty good photoshopping and color-shifted my cousin's suit and hair to black and made the makeup a natural tone. Because it was a group photo and the camera was pulled back, my cousin looked like a guy with a crappy haircut.

I didn't say anything but honestly, my sister had been just so mature and gracious about the whole thing. I'm embarrassed about my 16 year old self's thoughts about her wedding.

My cousin found out about the photoshop recently and has just been on a tear. She thinks the family is forcefully conforming her and were taking everything special from her. She wants to go limited contact with the family, and only contact them through me. 

I told her... look, I'm about the age you were then, and what you did back then was stupid, not funny. 

She argued back that I had laughed at the time. Which, I did. We sort of egged each other on, and though I knew she was going to dye her hair, I didn't know she was going to go full custome full of clashing colors. Though had I known, I may not have stopped her. I looked up to her so much and thought she was just awesome all around. 

Here's where I may be the asshole. I told her that I did laugh at the time, but now I'm older and realize it was messed up to dress like that for a very traditional wedding. That she made an ass of herself, and that my sister did her a favor by toning down the look in the pictures.

I guess that's made me the enemy now because I haven't heard from my cousin in weeks. 

This is so stupid to cut someone off over, but I know she feels like the odd one out in our very bland family. 

I don't know, internet. What do you think? Was I in the wrong? Should I reach out?

We sit down, wedding happens, its beautiful.  We get to ""social hour' as its called and there is no booze.  Turns out this was a dry wedding.  There was no indication that this was a dry wedding before showing up.  I checked the digital version of the invite and website.  Nothing indicating this. 

   
I'm pissed for a few reasons.  

1. I might not have RSVP'd yes if I knew this.  
2. I'm pissed i blew a few hundred bucks on a hotel for the night, babysitters, and ubers. 

 I'm like what the fuck.  Other friends that were their were grumbling and felt similar to me.  The night went on and the wedding was fine but honestly a bit of a bummer.  Now that my wife and I have kids, nights like this are rare, and I was pumped to do something.  So we dipped out a bit early and went out. Other friends rolled with.   We left in the middle of the dancing time and didn't stay for the exit.    


Later that night, I sent a venmo request for the cost of babysitter, hotel, and ubers.  

  
Yesterday, I heard from my college buddy.  He was like what the fuck is this asshole.  I explained I was mad that this was a dry wedding.  The bride had family that are alcoholics so they opted to not have alcohol as an option.  I told him thats need to know information.  Not informing us of that cost me and our other friends a lot of money.  He said I should have asked him and not assumed it was a wet wedding.  I said to him, alcohol is a default option, if you change the default you tell people.  He disagreed with that notion.  I said you drink, why would I think its dry?  We went back and forth for a while.  He still thinks i'm an asshole.  Am I?",Asshole,2024-05-15,"AITA for sending a venmo request for babysitter, hotel and uber reimbursement after a dry wedding?

It was frustrating to even speak to him. He is the kind of person to do or say things, just because he was told it was innapropriate to do or say.

My mother, M, has used me as an emotional whipping horse and has told me that she sees me as the weakest of her children. Anytime a sibling of mine, myself, sister (31F), or brother would accomplish something, she would compete with us to outdo us. I brought up that I had wanted to travel to walk the stage 2 or 3 times. Each time she deemed it unimportant, saying she didn't travel for her associates degree. The 3rd time, I had requested the tickets for myself and kids, plus.

I left Friday,10 hr drive. we enjoyed the graduation and a day of site seeing. It was a mini vacation.

I sent them pictures of myself and the kids and a video of the kids putting on my gown and hat for me.

Both B and M began texting nasty words. I explained that I tried to invite M but she kept saying the travel wasn't worth it and that B really didn't have high reguards for my degree. My sister was the only one to say congradulations.

M denies me saying anything she misunderstood, then she sent a group text saying that she was going to do something that would hurt me emotionally. I told her that I needed time after that, space because I didnt know she was capable of it. Then she said I can't take her gkids away, I told her to please give me space so I can think about what she said and before I said something. She continued and i ended up blocking her.

My brother started calling me last night and i told him I did not want to speak, in messages he was being very hurtful words. I told him I loved him, but their reactions are frightening and I needed space. He called my phone many, blocked him. Then on messenger  to continue to call, till I blocked him.

My sister sent me SS of him saying he will show up here this weekend, whether I would want him to or not.

But he discredits my tiredness by saying that my work is “easy” and “does demand much of me”. 

I work, study, go to the gym, I prep all my meals, I clean the house by myself 90% of times and whenever I go tell him to help around the house he says “I’m tired from work, you have all the time to do this kind of stuff” (We work at the same place but I go home 1-2 hours earlier). What gets me is that he gets home from work and just lays in bed till night, watching tiktoks or whatever. 

So imagine this: I do everything I have to do in a day, get home at 21:45 and my friends asks me to go to a friends house because “a girl is coming”. Whenever we would start discussing he would talk about everything he did on the week, like doing the bare minimum was a big thing for him. He doesn’t seem to see what I go through everyday. And that makes me think that maybe I do the same with him, which makes me back out on every discussion.

She's doing nothing to actually take care of herself and it was more of the same.

She then asked what I think.

I asked if she wants me to be truly honest.

45,1csxmmc,AITA for asking my girlfriend to remove an instagram post with a picture she had taken with her ex?,"I (30M) recently got into a fight with my girlfriend (30F) over an instagram post and I wanna know what people think about the situation.

My girlfriend just graduated from business school. She put together a post on her IG (everyone in her and my life follows her and sees her IG stuff) with a bunch of sentimental notes and like 10 pics from her previous 2 years in business school. ""2 of the best years of my life"" , ""will miss everyone so much"" etc etc.

One of the pictures was of 4 people all arm in arm: a gay friend, a girl friend, my girlfriend, and Sam (name changed) who she dated for 2 months before we started dating. They were holding each other very closely / tightly in this picture. It is obvious they were dating.

I saw this picture as we were across from each other and my heart sank. I felt this sense of intense disrespect and frustration that she'd post such a cozy intimate photo with this guy. I have nothing against Sam and I've met him a few times, he's an okay guy, but my feeling is that posting a picture arm in arm with an ex isn't really something you should do when you're in a relationship.

Anyways we got in this fight. I told her that the pic with Sam makes me feel like she's looking back on dating him fondly and putting it on instagram in front of her family and mine isn't really appropriate. Her response was that she wanted the picture up because of the gay friend and girlfriend and didn't think it'd be a big deal that Sam was in there too. She also reminded me that Sam and her didn't actually have sex and the relationship wasn't at all serious.

Eventually the fight ended with her asking me if I wanted her to delete the post. I told her yeah, and then she told me I was being an asshole and she wouldn't do it. I eventually let it go. The post is still up.

47,1csxlbd,AITAH For not telling my family about my graduation ceremony. ,"I am a first time poster so please stay with me, ti may be long.

I 37F ran into a conundrum. I do not have a great relationship with my brother, 39M or my Mother, 56F. I actually only speak to one person in my family, which is my youner sister. I have diagnosed cPTSD and anxiety due to the treatment from my family as a child and, when I got older, an ex.

I recently graduated with a dual masters degree, where the ceremony was several states away. Throughout the time going to school my brother, B, was very agressive about it. Putting down, first my bachelors and then my masters program consistantly, throughout the 6 years it took to achieve both. It was frustrating to even speak to him. Not only that, he is the kind of person to do or say things, just because he was told it was innapropriate to do or say. He would want to ""debate"" even if it was wrong, very argumentative. So, I did say i had gotten my degree, but not about the ceremony.

My mother, M, has used me as an emotional whipping horse and has told me that she sees me as the weakest of her children, because I had gone through so much. She used that to control what I would do or say. Anytime a sibling of mine, myself, sister (31F), or brother would accomplish something, she would compete with us to outdo us. I decided to give her a chance, i had brought up that I had wanted to travel for my degree and walk the stage. I brought it up 2 or 3 times. Each time she deemed it as unimportant, stating that she didn't travel for her associates degree she had gotten a few months ago. The 3rd time, I had requested the tickets for myself and kids (and some other people I thought of as important to invite, this is unknown to my family to stop any other fighting).

I planned to leave friday morning, but a tragety for myself and my kids happened, that delayed it by a few hours, but we were on the road. While very emotional that drive, we enjoyed the graduation and a day of site seeing. It was like a mini vacation. I had never been able to do things like this before, and it was so relaxing and felt amazing. The kids had a blast. Other than letting everyone know I was on Do not diserve and wishing a happy mothersday to my mom, is was unplugged. I drove home the next day and let everyone know why I was unavailable during the weekend. I sent them pictures of myself and the kids and a video of the kids putting on my gown and hat for me.

Well all heck broke loose! Both B and M began texting that I was ungrateful and how dare I not invite them. I explained that I tried to invite M but she kept saying the travel wasn't worth it and that B really didn't have high reguards for my degree. My sister was the only one to say congradulations.

It has been two days and the messages are getting progresively worse. My mother denies me saying anything but I had proof, she said she misunderstood, then she sent a group text saying that she was going to do something that would seriously hurt me emotionally. I told her that I needed time to be away from her for that. I needed space because I didnt know she was capable of it. Then she said I cannot take her grandkids away, I told her to please give me space so I can decompress from waht she said and before I said something I would regret. She continued and i ended up blocking her.

My brother started calling me last night and i told him I did not want to speak, in text messages he was being very hurtful calling mehurtful words. I told him I loved him, but their reactions are frightening and I needed space. He called my phone 8 more times, till I blocked him. Then he switched to messenger with the same lingo and proceded to continue to call, till I blocked him there.

My sister sent me screeshots of him saying he will show up here this weekend, whether I woudl want him to or not. I sent out a group message that i asked for space, to please not come here, they are forcing me to call the police if they do. (My mom has been extremel during fights, as has my brother). Then another message came through that if I call the police they will hide at a neighbors till the police leave and then they will wait for me outside.

I live in housing, contacting police can get me evicted before I can line up a job for my career and relocate. None of my friends say I am the AH, but with how they are reacting, AITAH for not telling them about the ceremony?

There is more to the story, please ask, I know there are limits to what I can type.

48,1csxfpu,AITA for turning off our shared wi-fi for my flatmate and taking my own kitchen utensils to my room?,"First of all, I must warn you that English isn't my first language.

I (30F) am renting a flat with other flatmates,  About a year ago a new flatmate (29F), let's call her Beth, moved in. I told her that we are free to invite guests with a warning beforehand and they don't create any inconvenience, also I told her that we have a schedule for cleaning the common zones. She agreed on that terms.

Firstly she missed 2 of her turns to clean the flat and didn't even tried to exchange these dates. After some nagging Beth finally cleaned the apartment on her turn on her third month of living .

Next were friends of hers that went back and forth every day of the week, sometimes 3, 4, or even 5 people together. Beth failed to warn us about the guests in pretty much every 3 case and played loud music on weeknights. We asked her to be quieter but it didn’t help.

At some point after asking nicely to stop it I snapped and told her to stop that behaviour. The final straw at this point was the fact that her friend (22M) lived at her room while she was abroad and we've learned that postfactum.

She tried to talk back but eventually we made a peace. Beth tried to clean up the apartment on her turn this time and bring less of the guests.

Next, my condiments at kitchen and me and my flatmates’ bath stuff started to end really fast. I asked repeatedly in our group chat, why don't the thief ask me nicely to borrow my stuff and start screwing back the lids of stuff they used, but all I've got was radio silence.

Then Beth got a boyfriend. And he started to show up non stop, with or without announcements, they had a quite loud banging almost every night, friends and partys were back, so the messy bessy of the flatmate.

Me and my other flatmate tried to reconcile in civil manners more than for 4 months, but I've snapped again and brought up all of above mentioned and that I caught her red-handed on stealing my condiments etc. After that she stopped to cleaning up and warn us about guests at all.

I was fed up. So one day I took all my own kitchen utensils and locked it in my room. Beth was using it too all this time and she wasn't happy. She wrote in her Twitter that I was f\*cked up in the head.

Next I disconnected her homepod, laptop and music speaker from our shared wi-fi, because to be honest I was tired of constant music blasting. She once again complained on Twitter she have to turn on her mobile internet to listen to music on speakers.

I'm not doing anything further because it's pretty much all I can do and well she is person who doesn't give a shit about people that live with her which is what you can expect from a 16 year old, but not from the adult.

Me and my roommates are planning a flat meeting to discuss everything (including Beth) on this weekend, but I don’t have high hopes on it. My friends told me that this situation is kinda f\*cked, but I shouldn't have to disconnect her from our shared wi-fi.

49,1csxeh6,AITA for shutting down a phone conversation when going to bed?,"I've struggled with sleep for years, time in the Navy gave me circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. This makes it hard to fall sleep which leads to exhaustion during the day, I also get migraines without enough sleep. I've managed to get things stable but if I miss my “sleep window” I end up awake all night.

I wake at 4am for work. So my “bed time” is 8pm to try and get 8-ish hrs of sleep night. My current schedule allows enough sleep that I'm no longer affected by migraines or extreme tiredness even if I miss sleeping a night during the week.

My gf's sleep schedule generally consists of staying up late and sleeping in late. This has lead to multiple arguments and I have told her I feel like she doesn’t respect my need for sleep before. She will still try to start long, draw out conversations right before I want to go to sleep.

All that to say; I was dropping my daughter off at her mom’s house yesterday evening. I called my girlfriend on my way home in hopes of having a light conversation but she didn’t pick up. I got home, got ready to sleep and texted her that I was going to bed, I loved her, and goodnight since we didn't talk on the phone. She immediately called me which irritated me. I picked up the phone, greeted her and told her I was going to sleep and didn’t want to talk, I had just texted her to say goodnight and it was past the time I wanted to be in bed due to dropping my daughter off at her mom’s. She told me she was dealing with her animals and couldn't pick up when I called, got upset at me and then got off the phone.

This is the text I woke up to: “Sorry it took me some time to call you back. I didn’t hear my phone because of what I was doing with the animals”

My response: “I’m not looking for an apology. I’m not mad you missed my call because you had shit going on. You know my schedule, you know when I make calls normally, if you don’t pick up I assume you have something more important going on.

I was irritated because I texted you goodnight since we weren’t able to talk and I’m literally getting into bed at that point. I want to go to sleep, my brain is winding down to go to sleep, i have already accepted that we didn’t get to talk and moved on from it. I don’t want to talk on the phone anymore I want to go to bed.”

She left me on read the entire day and then sent this: “I’ve been re-reading that last paragraph you sent. I don’t even know how to respond. Your “honesty” comes off as so god damn mean sometimes. Maybe I’m sensitive, maybe I’m not. I don’t care at this point. I apologize for calling you back at a time that I clearly shouldn’t have. It won’t happen again.”

I feel like my reply was mild considering how often I’ve had to remind her my sleep schedule is important to my well being as it keeps me from getting migraines and allows me to participate in daily activities with her, her kids, and my kid without feeling like I'm going to pass out.

50,1csx5ni,AITA for critiquing my wife on a bad experience she had at the store?,"I came home from work and my wife (we're both in our early thirties if this helps at all?) was wanting to tell me about a bad experience she had at the store (a large membership-based bulk buying type of place). Giving her my full attention she begins:

My wife's friend is having a housewarming/post-divorce celebration and my wife agreed to bring a cake. This friend suggested this particular store for custom worded cakes and my wife set off to place an order. When my wife arrives at the bakery, she is met with a sign that reads ""Place cake orders online! Scan Here."" She opens her phone, scans the QR code, and makes her way through the site's options for the cake; until she gets to the font which is only allowing/showing a very boring and bold type font.

Throughout this first part of the story I'm nodding my head and adding in my own thoughts as well without interrupting. ""Oh that should be fun."" ""Yea those can be annoying."" Stuff like that.

My wife finds a worker (Early 20s maybe? My wife was also using a stereotypical ""valley girl"" voice when quoting them and I tried my best to ignore as I know eventually this person was about to upset her) nearby stocking bakery items, and asks them about the cake customization. Questions like: ""I there a place to set a pick-up time?"" and ""I can only get it to show a bold font, is there a way to change this?"" The worker explains the date appears towards the end of the customization and the font depends on who ever is working that day, to which my wife responds ""Well I'm not going to pay for something if I don't know what it looks like."" At this moment the worker turns without another word and walks away from my wife. As the worker is walking away my wife doesn't yell, but says within this worker's earshot, ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" ""This is fucking ridiculous."" From here my wife leaves the store.

I tell the wife, ""Yes that seems a bit rude of the worker, but honestly had that been me and I heard her reaction as I was walking away, I probably wouldn't have helped you either.""

From here my wife becomes upset with me, and begins accusing me of invalidating her actions not just on this interaction but other times she has butt heads with family members or strangers. This got me thinking, have I really been invalidating her or have I not have her back like I should in these instances? AITA for critiquing her reaction to the worker walking away?

I truly think both of them could have been better to each other in this situation and I tried and failed to convey this in a way to deescalate tensions. The worker could have easily deferred to another baker if they were too busy stocking and the wife could maybe could not feel entitled to immediate resolution to the closest available staff member.

51,1csx5bc,AITA for telling my mother I wish she hadn’t visited Yellowstone with my partner and I?,"I am an American woman married to a Dutch man and living in Europe with him. I take trips back to the USA about once a year to see my mother but my partner had never joined me due to an intense work schedule.

Recently, he had a rare opportunity for 2 consecutive weeks off so he jumped on the opportunity as I had been talking about visiting the USA soon and tried to tempt him into coming along by offering to combine the visit with a trip to Yellowstone National Park. My husband had never been outside of Europe and visiting all the US national parks is one of his dreams. 

We booked the trip, my mother was happy we’d be visiting, and my husband meticulously planned our days in Yellowstone. My mother is not very fit and didn’t want to hike so he was careful to plan out spots for her to hang out at during our planned hikes that would have indoor rest areas, restrooms, activities/shopping, and food. 

Everyone was very much looking forward to the trip but fast forward to my mother, my husband, and I in Yellowstone and things quickly went downhill.

My mother behaved in a very demanding manner from day one. Insisting on an overpacking ordeal that put us three hours behind schedule. The car was overflowing with her stuff -cot bed, xl tent, extra pillows and sheets, self-standing hammock, and several boxes of camping gadgets. 

Once there, she became annoyed at how often we wanted to hike and convinced us into shortening some of our hikes so as to not leave her alone long. Fair, but I felt bad for my husband as we already decided against several activities he wanted to do in favor of less sporty things my mom would do. 

There was tension the whole time because my husband has a direct way of communicating and this frequently upset my mother as she felt he was being rude. This came to a head when she asked him if he’d like to go to a gift shop (her way of saying she wants to go shopping) and he said he didn’t. 

Well she absolutely blew up after he said no. Told him he has no manners and told me I was a selfish daughter for not planning the trip around visiting her and saying she never wanted to come to Yellowstone. (Before the trip I asked her several times if I should visit her alone first and then meet my partner in Yellowstone later. She insisted she wanted to go).

Feeling angry and defensive of my partner because this trip was a huge deal for him, I snapped back at her that I wish she had not come along to Yellowstone. 

She spent the next hour crying and I felt awful for what I said. I am still angry with her for how she acted on the trip but I may have gone too by saying she shouldn’t have come.

Anyway, I kept all the cash gifts and my parents deposited the checks in their account since I didn't have one yet. This amount was $2,000. Over these four years, I have not seen a penny of it. Instead, they keep borrowing from me, $300 for credit card things, $400 to repair something in the house, and the latest of $200 and there will be more (confirmed by my mom). I normally have no problem about money or lending them money, since I have no bills. But, over the past year or so, they've been borderline threatening me with rent. I live with my 25 yr old brother and sister, and our parents. They are planning on charging them too, but it feels a little unfair to be charged way earlier than my siblings were (they've never charged rent on anyone before this). Admittedly this wouldn't be much, at first they said $100 a month, but it still feels so unfair for me to worry about this at 20 (at the time).

This brings me to now, they almost keep dangling rent over my head, they told me if I do more chores, maybe I won't be charged, but I do the most chores. My whole life has felt like I was never worth the effort, and now our relationship has this weird monetary strain to it.

They said they don't want to spend anymore money on trips until they help pay for an upcoming event, but they keep planning them.

55,1cswnu2,AITA for not supporting my coworkers when they wanted less work?,"My first post here, so here it is.

My name is R(22m) and I work at a resort in Mexico, with my coworkers J(26f) and E(32).

To make it short, us three are at the bottom of who gets the orders at the workplaceand they both do absolutely everything together, bathroom or lunch breaks, the different tasks by higher ranks, the usual work stuff, etc. I don't mind this at all, they share interests and really hit it off well, that's always good for work and I get to do my work quickly because I don't really get distracted that much, which is good because we have to walk around 3 large properties every day.

Our issue started when they suddenly felt they were getting more work then before. I really didn't notice and I attribute that to me not minding all the walking and all the stairs.

2 days ago, I had to verify 7 different rooms and they had 16, when suddenly they told me someone else would cover my rooms, so should cover 10 of their rooms since ""they were closer"" and that I shouldn't mind the work. Once I was done with my share they asked to help a higher up with his work greeting the guests. While I was waiting the supervisor told me I could either go or stay a little longer to cover the rest. Since I was the last on shift I decided to stay at the lobby. Some 20 minutes before my return, they call me to tell me that I had work to do in the are that was covered in my behalf. Turns out, they had to do that work, since they send me to a different station. So I decided to get back to the office.

Once I'm back they look at me fuming and asked me:
E: why are you back?
Me: You said I had work (and smiled)
E: really? Mr. S said you decided to stay.
Me: yeah, I like to greet the guest.
J: You know we covered all your work, right?
Me: I was just informed.
E: You're going to end late.
Me: I'll make it time.
They got angrier and shunned me and said I was an a-hile to each other. Right at my face.

Later my other coworker O(29m) explained to me that they were making a case on how the  supervisor temporarily in charge was giving to much work while he left early. They didn't let me in on this and felt I was being apathetic to their case. I was also informed about a discussion that without me on how J was made to look bad because I work faster with less errors and no complaints, and because of that all three get more work.

I express my discomfort with the situation and told them that wouldn't do less work just because they didn't want to do work, seeing as they didn't bother to talk this with me and just got mad without giving me context.

I know I am maybe being apathetic, and I do have a ""resting b1that face"" so maybe that's why people think I am not feeling them. But I don't feel like I deserved the title of A-hole.

My name is R(22m) and I work at a resort in Mexico, with my coworkers J(26f) and E(32).

To make it short, us three are at the bottom of who gets the orders at the workplaceand they both do absolutely everything together, bathroom or lunch breaks, the different tasks by higher ranks, the usual work stuff, etc. I don't mind this at all, they share interests and really hit it off well, that's always good for work and I get to do my work quickly because I don't really get distracted that much, which is good because we have to walk around 3 large properties every day.

Our issue started when they suddenly felt they were getting more work then before. I really didn't notice and I attribute that to me not minding all the walking and all the stairs.

2 days ago, I had to verify 7 different rooms and they had 16, when suddenly they told me someone else would cover my rooms, so should cover 10 of their rooms since ""they were closer"" and that I shouldn't mind the work. Once I was done with my share they asked to help a higher up with his work greeting the guests. While I was waiting the supervisor told me I could either go or stay a little longer to cover the rest. Since I was the last on shift I decided to stay at the lobby. Some 20 minutes before my return, they call me to tell me that I had work to do in the are that was covered in my behalf. Turns out, they had to do that work, since they send me to a different station. So I decided to get back to the office.

Once I'm back they look at me fuming and asked me:
E: why are you back?
Me: You said I had work (and smiled)
E: really? Mr. S said you decided to stay.
Me: yeah, I like to greet the guest.
J: You know we covered all your work, right?
Me: I was just informed.
E: You're going to end late.
Me: I'll make it time.
They got angrier and shunned me and said I was an a-hile to each other. Right at my face.

Later my other coworker O(29m) explained to me that they were making a case on how the  supervisor temporarily in charge was giving to much work while he left early. They didn't let me in on this and felt I was being apathetic to their case. I was also informed about a discussion that without me on how J was made to look bad because I work faster with less errors and no complaints, and because of that all three get more work.

I express my discomfort with the situation and told them that wouldn't do less work just because they didn't want to do work, seeing as they didn't bother to talk this with me and just got mad without giving me context.

I know I am maybe being apathetic, and I do have a ""resting b1that face"" so maybe that's why people think I am not feeling them. But I don't feel like I deserved the title of A-hole.

I (16F) have a very bad relationship with my parents due to a plethora of reasons I believe they are narcissists and that they do not care about me (particularly because they say it) and also because they have a long history of physically abusing me especially because when I was about 11 and became selectively mute and sewer slidable from the stress and it gives me headaches when I cry. Their work surrounds caring for the elderly but my mum has admitted to leaving clients without a bed for a night. All this said I truly think they are horrible people who I cannot last around much longer... But anyone would call me a spoilt child if I did because no-one knows this.

Fast forwards to my birthday. My SIXTEENTH birthday. From the years of degradation I have found it hard to make friend especially with kind hearts so I don't have any right now I don't think I'm better than anyone I'm just very shy. I went to sleep on the big day it was after school so I was tired and I took a nap. 

I wake up and its 9:30 my mum starts yelling at me for wasting everyone's time and because they all put so much work into my party and I didn't want to come.They didnt even wake me up. They didnt even try. I know this because most every morning one of them comes and wakes me up for school without fail. But they all pretended I was the selfish one.

Fast forwards to my dad's birthday I was outside because I didn't want to join in and my mum said I kid you not ""Is it that hard?"" to celebrate his birthday I didn't even argue I just went to my room because she never has or will give me a sincere apology for any of this and she only takes care of me when she sees me pulling away or becoming slightly mute again.

57,1cswdfn,AITA for demanding an apology from my mother while refusing to apologize for something I already apologized for?,"I worked for my brother for 20 years after turning down a huge opportunity making six figures in NYC. I brought my girlfriend-now-wife from the city she adored where she had a solid career. For 20 years I was consistently the rainmaker of the firm, worked long hours, weekends, holidays. On a office wide conference call it was announced to the entire firm--including me, for the first time, that two associates were named partners and the firm was ""rebranding"". This was never discussed with me, at all.

Humiliated,I had no choice but to leave the firm. This was a huge shock and disruption. At 58, tough to rehire.One kid was headed to college and the other was halfway thru private high school. My FILs funeral was the next day. My wife was terrified.My daughter offered to delay college.I had very little time to set up my new firm, secure work, etc.

Didn't hear from mom for 2 months afterward. After nervously prattling about the weather she blurted out ""I know there's stuff going on at work"", immediately adding she ""didn't want to get involved.""(She had heard something had happened, obviously, but was not interested in my telling of it.)She did not ask about my financial state, what I was going to do, or even how I felt.I told her I was upset by her reaction and why. Then I hung up on her, apologizing for that almost immediately in a text (wife talked me into it).

Mom sent me a card saying she was sorry she hurt my feelings, but she ""refused to be a referee"" in this matter. Again, I corrected her in a text, I didn't want a referee, I wanted her concern and support, I wanted her to be interested in what would happen with me and my family.

She continues to send passive-aggressive guilt trip birthday cards to me and my kids (ignoring my wife, who thinks is just a troublemaker in general and is supporting our estrangement...my wife grew up with abusive drug-addicted parents who she was estranged from for periods), refuses to call me directly, and  angrily insists (in cards) I am the one who needs to apologize (for hanging up on her years ago). She falsely accused me of refusing to speak to her unless she cuts off the rest of the fam. I wrote her a letter explaining all this recently, never heard back. My kids (now both at college)are angry with the fam including Grandma. The cousins shame them for being mean and disrespectful to Grandma. I might also add that I am the only one who did not ""marry up"", my wife grew up poor has been snubbed by fam for years for years, which my parents allowed. AITA? Are my kids?

58,1cswaj4,AITA for spending my birthday with my friends?,"This post is gonna sound fake af. I already know that. But I genuinely do need judgement. I have an older sister, Hailey, and I was born on her birthday. I'm technically only her half brother, and she was already struggling with the remarriage, she was 5 when I was born. She was feeling replaced already and my mum and stepdad didn't want to make it worse, so my birthday was kinda shoved aside a bit. For context where I'm from the 3 most important birthdays are 13, 16, and 21.

We'd celebrate them 'together' but until I was like 12 I didn't have a scrap of input, because after all I was just a kid, who didn't know what he wanted. At 13 I wanted seperate cakes, because she was turning 18 and I'd still never got to blow out my own candles. I got a pink one. I sound spoiled but really? 13, one of the 'big three' birthdays and I, a guy, get a pink cake. 

On 14 and 15 it was similar, although I did get an 'and \[my name\]' on our cake for 15. So things were going up in the world. But as I said, 21 is a major birthday and my parents were going all. out. I'm talking extended family, presents, whole ass balloon arches. Even I was getting to have input in for once. But I kind of just wanted a day where I was the 'main' focus. I get that Hailey's never been the only focus either, but I didn't need that. I just wanted to come first for once.

I have some great friends. And they wanted to throw a party for me. It wasn't going to be a fancy schmancy thing like my parent's one, but it was gonna be about ME, and sure a bit selfish. But I wanted that.

So, long story short, I went against my parents wishes, despite them assuring me this one was going to be about both of us and that they just wanted to celebrate the 16 of mine and 21 of my sister together, with all the extended family. But no, I embarassed them. I didn't go to the first party they've planned with me properly in mind and ruined part of Hailey's day too since half the questions she got was where I was.

I, on the other hand, had a great day. Perfect in fact. I'm still riding the high. But when I got home, I had my parent's quiet dissapointment and Hailey's crying about how I ruined her day and what an asshole I was for ruining my parent's attempt to make it up to me and her birthday all in one. And I get that to a degree, but I really, really, really wanted this.

60,1csw78d,AITA for telling my daughter she can’t wear her AirPods when walking around the house? ,"My daughter (15F) got her first pair of Air Pods a couple of months ago for her birthday. Ever since, we’ve had the issue of her walking around the house with them in, us not being able to tell because her hair is long and covers her ears. That in itself wouldn’t be an issue but if we try talking to her without realizing they’re in and have to repeat her name or tap her on the shoulder, she gets irritated, rips one out of her ear and snaps “What?!”

We’ve tried talking about it. I said before she can’t use them as an excuse to not answer us or be open to talk. I’m not even looking for in-depth conversations here. But if I need to ask her to get her laundry out of the dryer so I can use it, I feel it’s not unreasonable for me to be able to come up to her and ask without her acting like I’m bothering her.

We’ve tried to compromise, one pod in when she’s walking around. She will for a couple of days but then go back to both. Let us know ahead of time if she’s going to the cone of silence. She will but then forgets.

After an incident when her dad went to ask her what she wanted for dinner and she snapped at him for “interrupting her song” (once again, he didn’t see the Air Pods were in), we had enough. We told her that she can only use the Air Pods in her room or outside the house when she goes for runs, is out with friends, etc. I told her it’s ridiculous that we can’t ever talk to her. She got huffy and said that wasn’t fair. I said if she doesn’t adhere to the rules, I’ll take them away altogether until she learns to be respectful.

Now she’s pissed and says we’re being totally unfair. Are we the assholes?

63,1csvwv0,AITA for telling my husband not to wear shirts from another woman ,"My husband who I’ll call J (42m) is a manager for a large restaurant. He loves his staff and they love him. He is funny and kind and just a really good guy. He’s also really into cats. We have a cat who he adores, he has a lot of cat accessories, he shares cat memes and videos with everyone - he just really likes cats. Last Christmas, I bought him some short sleeved dress shirts with big cat designs on them for work. He loved them and he got lots of compliments from staff. 

This past winter there was an ice storm where I live. We don't get a lot of snow and ice so when we do, everything kind of shuts down. A lot of restaurants close but J’s opened for business that day. No one else that works in the front of house showed up that day except for one bartender, who I'll call A.

That day, despite the ice, the restaurant ended up being really busy and short staffed with only J and A. So  J took all the tables and bar guests that A couldn't and at the end of the shift he transferred them to A so she'd get the tips. A ended up making a lot of money that day because of this. As a thank you gift, she gave him a box of sweets from a local bakery and a bottle of mead she home brews. I thought those were appropriate gifts, but the other thing she bought him were 3 cat dress shirts for work. 

I didn’t like that for a few reasons. 1: Buying clothes for other people is kind of an intimate gift in my opinion. I wouldn’t even feel this way if it was a tshirt she saw in passing and thought of him but it’s not. 2: The shirts she bought are very similar to the ones I bought him which are from Amazon- which means she shopped for the shirts. Also J is a bigger guy so not only did she have to shop to find the perfect shirts, she also had to make sure they made them in his size.

I need to say here that I don't think he did anything wrong. I trust my husband and I really do not believe he had any intentions or feelings towards her. I don't trust A's intentions though and her gifts seem inappropriate not only because he's a married man, but because he is her boss. 

I shared my feelings with J and asked that he didn't wear her shirts to work because it encourages this behavior. He agreed not to but he thinks I’m being irrational. He said she was just doing a nice thing for him and everyone knows cats are his thing. We agreed to disagree on that but I am questioning myself. Am I being irrational here? Is this an appropriate gift that I should have just let be? Am I the asshole?",Asshole,2024-05-15,"AITA for telling my husband not to wear shirts from another woman  My husband who I’ll call J (42m) is a manager for a large restaurant. He loves his staff and they love him. He is funny and kind and just a really good guy. He’s also really into cats. We have a cat who he adores, he has a lot of cat accessories, he shares cat memes and videos with everyone - he just really likes cats. Last Christmas, I bought him some short sleeved dress shirts with big cat designs on them for work. He loved them and he got lots of compliments from staff. 

This past winter there was an ice storm where I live. We don't get a lot of snow and ice so when we do, everything kind of shuts down. A lot of restaurants close but J’s opened for business that day. No one else that works in the front of house showed up that day except for one bartender, who I'll call A.

That day, despite the ice, the restaurant ended up being really busy and short staffed with only J and A. So  J took all the tables and bar guests that A couldn't and at the end of the shift he transferred them to A so she'd get the tips. A ended up making a lot of money that day because of this. As a thank you gift, she gave him a box of sweets from a local bakery and a bottle of mead she home brews. I thought those were appropriate gifts, but the other thing she bought him were 3 cat dress shirts for work. 

I didn’t like that for a few reasons. 1: Buying clothes for other people is kind of an intimate gift in my opinion. I wouldn’t even feel this way if it was a tshirt she saw in passing and thought of him but it’s not. 2: The shirts she bought are very similar to the ones I bought him which are from Amazon- which means she shopped for the shirts.

64,1csvrgh,AITA for failing to pick my husband up from the train station?,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway for privacy reasons.

Today my (30f) husband (45m) was travelling for work. He had a 2 hour train journey each way.

Just to give some background, we live together and have a young child. We both work full time in high pressure jobs but I'm the main earner so I pay the majority of our mortgage and bills.

Additionally, I do almost all of our child's school drop offs and pick ups (an hour round trip by car each way) and all homework stuff. I also do 80 percent of the house chores. When I travel for business overnight, my parents do the childcare. My husband does the cooking four nights a week and he does his own laundry.

To add, I also struggle with severe depression and I'm currently working on my recovery from an eating disorder relapse. 

With work and childcare and everything else,  I'm pretty burned out but I still try to always be there for my husband when he needs me.

However, this morning he went on this work trip to another city. He left early and I couldn't take him to the train station as I was getting our child ready for school, doing breakfast etc. He was not happy about that but he accepted it. I had been up since 5am and took my kid to school for 8am and then came home and worked until 4.30. I normally work a few hours in the evening too. 

Work was very intensive and I was already tired when I went to pick my kid up. My child fell asleep during the car journey and went straight to bed when we got home. I hadn't heard from my husband since the morning so I didn't know what time he was getting back.

I went to lie down on the couch and fell asleep. When I woke up an hour later I saw he had messaged me asking if I could pick him up from the station. However, it was already too late as I realised from the time stamp he must have arrived. We live a 10/15 minute walk from the station and because I didn't pick him up he'd had to walk home carrying his laptop bag. 

He was furious with me that I'd fallen asleep and missed his messages. He said he was so disappointed in me and that I should have known I needed to be on standby for him. I always try to prioritise him and I hate myself for failing. He doesn't want me around so I've been sitting crying in the spare room for the past couple of hours.

My husband is very vocal about supporting local businesses, going plastic free, minimising meat intake etc. Before we moved in together, he explained it all to me and said we can meet in the middle because I’m the opposite but it would be a complete dealbreaker if I was not willing to try act more mindfully too. We did a trial run of moving in, it went well and have been living with this lifestyle for a couple years now. It helps that he contributes more toward groceries of his own volition because it does cost a bit more to live like this. I spend a little more because it’s buying for two but not a lot more than what I was when I was buying groceries for just myself.

This is where the hiccup comes in. I am TIRED of having to make my own coffee. He likes to buy the beans from a local roaster, he knows everyone who works there and is very happy that his money is going towards a process where farmers are paid a decent wage and not to a huge corporation who don’t treat the farmers they liaise with well. 

I like instant. I add milk anyway to my coffee so there is not a huge difference in taste to me using instant vs adding milk to coffee made where he used beans. It’s also a lot quicker in my eyes and easier. A spoon of instant and some hot water takes 2 minutes max. His process takes longer. 

I brought it up last week that I would like to start having instant coffee in the house again (he has essentially said no to me buying it since we moved in). I explained that it’s easier, quicker and cheaper. He said that his way is just as quick (Aeropress) and he said he can pregrind it for me so I just have to add it in and plunge the coffee and it’s even better than instant. I argued that I have to use scales to measure water every time and it’s just easier for me to use instant. He offered to type out instructions for me or make markings on the Aeropress so I don’t need to measure the water and coffee but that feels a bit condescending. 

I didn’t think he’d be so upset. He seemed fine after the talk but then got a bit distant over the week. When I asked him what was wrong, he told me that I know this is something he feels strongly about and my reasoning doesn’t make any sense because it does take the same amount of time using instant vs his beans. He said he doesn’t know if we should proceed with getting married because he can’t be sure 5 years down the line that I will be happy living the lifestyle we do now and will want to backtrack.

After we moved to a different neighborhood around the time I turned 4 we didn't really see him that much anymore.

But to be honest i don't really want to go.

I barely knew anything about this guy besides the handful of interactions I've had with him over the past two decade and based on things my family has told me, they distanced themselves from him because he basically turned into, for lack of a better term, a scumbag and was constantly getting in trouble with the cops for stealing, drugs, etc. I also won't know literally anyone else there besides my dad and it just feels like an incredibly uncomfortable situation to be in, but my dad just said it like it was somehow expected of me to go.

Ever since I was very little I have had emetophobia, during some periods so extreme that I was hospitalized because of s\*icide attempts or that I refused to eat. As an adult, it has gotten better, but it is still a cause for anxiety and panic attacks, something that my boyfriend is very aware of and super supportive about. My boyfriend is kind of the golden retriever type, always happy and without much worries. He is usually very respectful in regards to my mental health issues, though.

We are doing long distance (him in Spain and me in Norway) and when this event occurred we were speaking on the phone the night before him traveling to visit me. He told me that he had just attended a family dinner, and that his grandma had called five minutes ago to say that the entire family had gotten some sort of stomach flu the night before (they forgot to say so during dinner). This of course triggered my anxiety, but I decided, in true CBT-spirit, that I could not possibly ask him to cancel his trip simply because of this. I told him, however, that if he felt any symptoms himself, I would happily pay for new tickets a few days later, not to risk anything. He works online, so no vacation would be wasted.

I woke up next morning to a text saying that he had boarded the plane, and that he had vomited all night but felt a bit better now. It shocked me, for many reasons, mainly wondering how on earth he could get on a plane in the middle of a stomach flu and how he did not care about all the other passengers. He responded by saying that “In Spain stomach flus aren’t considered such a big thing” and that they would be fine. I, on the other hand, was not fine. It took all of my strength to gather some focus in the middle of the panic attack, and I went to the supermarket and bought a weekend worth of food, prepared some easy-on-the-stomach dishes ready to microwave and wrote a lot of comforting notes. Then I left and stayed at my moms place for three full days.

I want to be super clear. IF he at any time would have gotten so sick that he needed real help, I would have gone back to my apartment and helped him. This I told him repeatedly, and I checked on him asking if I should drive by and drop more food, etc.

He, and his family, was very shocked by my behavior, and could not understand how I could be so selfish. In Spain, he argued, you would normally go to work/school/someone’s home the morning after vomiting all night, given that you felt ok enough, and it is us Scandinavians that are super sensitive and selfish.

70,1csv3dc,AITA for threatening to call the police on my brother-in-law?,"So let me try to get all of the pertinent information out within the word limit.  The gist of my post is that almost halfway through the year, I (39m) have threatened to call the cops on my brother-in-law because I suspect some of my belongings may have been sold. Those belongings have been in storage since October, 2022.

In mid-2022 I was sharing a house with my sister (then pregnant with her second child) and her husband. She discovered her husband had cheated on her with at least two women. Physically with a neighbor and at least emotionally with a woman online.  At the time, preggo sister moved out with baby #1 to live with our mother.

It was already the plan to sell the house, but this accelerated it. I started looking for a new place and pack. It was at this time I noticed her Switch gaming console.  I messaged her and asked if she took it with her. She said no.

Turned out her husband had gone behind her back and sold it to a used game store. His story changed twice when caught in the lie.This Switch was a birthday gift from me to my sister a few years back.

It's October 2022, I suffered from an embolism.  Most of my large intestines have been removed and I have an ostomy bag.  I was told my stuff is in storage.  I lost a lot of muscle mass in that time. So, I eventually upgrade to a nursing home in 2023 and continue to attend therapy as the hospital allows. I eventually apply to and get accepted into an income-based, handicapped accessible apartment ""back home."" Ultimately, I moved into my new apartment, January, 2024.

Now, sometime in 2023, my sister took her cheating X back. They were co-parenting so she was bound to see him a lot. For a time, the brother-in-law was living in that original apartment I was going to move into, which is why I know it was shitty. Not that he asked for it, but he was watching my two cats. Both of whom died, I assume at the same time.

When I moved into my apartment, my sister and her husband were able to get a lot of my things from storage to my new apartment. But it's not everything. Unfortunately, as my things got packed up, my sister also packed her stuff up and a lot of it got stored together. Every time I'd ask if another family member could go to the unit, she's said she needs to be there to say what's hers. I am having enough mobility issues currently, being wheelchair bound. I can't just go to the storage unit and direct someone to pick through boxes I sadly did not pack.

My fear is, I have a lot of gaming and collectibles. I have some back in my possession. But previously when I've asked my sister said she couldn't guarantee her husband hadn't sold some of my belongings. Sadly, I've asked so much she's now angrily said he hasn't sold anything. But I argue, until I see for myself, I don't know that. His past actions prove otherwise.

When I mentioned getting the police involved, she got very pissed.  AITA?

71,1csuv00,AITA for throwing my girlfriend's wine away??,"I, 21M have been living with my girlfriend, Amy since I was 19. We share the space, and have a generally healthy relationship so make compromises for each other. I, for example, don't put my papers anywhere but the study, and never use any of the mildly staining spices in our kitchen. She drinks, I don't and I have a huge distaste for alcohol of all kinds, vapes or other such substances. Amy, has currently finished her exam season, while mine is still on-going and is enjoying her freedom from the gruelling hours of memorisation with a LOT of partying. 

I don't mind, obviously, I've been spending most of my days at the library or at a mate's place. However the issue I've been having lately is for the past 2-3 weeks she has consistently been leaving wine glasses and alcohol out in the living room. Every day I come home, and every day, they are there, and every day I ask her to please stop leaving them out. Thats one of the agreed upon compromises when we first moved in together, we have a whole cupboard for any and all alcohol related things she wants, just please keep them in there.

2 days ago, I told her that either she stopped leaving them everywhere in the living room, or I would throw them out myself, it was an empty threat, I had no actual intentions of throwing her stuff away.

Yesterday I came home to bottles, strewn on the ground, not even on the table or something, everything was an utter mess. It was late by this point and Amy was asleep, and I was furious, I'd already failed a practice test and studied god-damn cOsMoLoGy (like genuinely, who cares) for 3 hours. So I decided to make good on my threat, I put the glasses in the sink and threw away every bottle I found in the living room, every last one. And then I went to bed. 

She called me an asshole and threatened to sue me(?) for destruction of property. I told her, good luck. And then left for the library. She told me not to bother coming back, so I'm not, I'm staying at a mates and now she's even more furious.

74,1csuno9,WIBTAH if I didn’t come to my boyfriends family function that I have been invited to?,"I (f19) have been with my bf (m19) for about a year and a half. We go to the same HS, except I stay in our schools dorms and he lives near the city where the school is located. This means that I’ve spent quite a lot of time over at his house with his family and their family friends.

Well lately, they started inviting me to their family meetings. Whetener it was a small barbecue or his dads’ 40th birthday most of them I can’t attend cause of me staying in the school dorms. The dorms are closed during the weekend, so on fridays I go home and come back on sundays. 

I use the weekends to study, wash my laundry, help around the house and spend time with my family. Lately tho the most important for me was studying, as in two weeks I’ll have my oral graduation exams and the weekend of the same week I’ll also be writing admission exams for my university. 

So that means I basically spend all my free time studying. This is why last week I declined my bfs’ dads’ invitation to his b-day party. My bf told me that they were allright with me not coming and that they understand that I need to study rn. 

Well this weekend they invited me to my boyfriends cousins’ first communion. I am not religious, nor do I know his uncle or cousins very well. But I feel very bad about declining another family function they invited me to. My bf told me that it’s allright and to not worry about it, but I still feel bad. 

A few days ago when I was over at his house his grandma mentioned the communion and asked if I was coming. I told her that I am not sure yet as I have a lot of studying I need to do and I haven’t asked my parents yet if they are okay with me not coming home on friday. She replied with “Well then you better try to study harder during the week so you can come on saturday.” 

I know she didn’t mean it in a bad way, but it made me feel like not coming would make his family think I am distancing myself from them.

Another reason why I feel like TAH is cause I spend a lot of time at his house. I sleep over every weekend sunday till monday and sometimes during the week. During most school breaks I come to his house, because I’ll have to come to the city anyway for school after the break. So I feel like by not coming it might feel like I am saying “I will use you for free housing but don’t expect me to do something for you.” to them. Even tho they have all told me multiple times that they don’t mind me coming over.

75,1csu9hm,AITA for not telling my family that my boyfriend is a registered S.E.X offender,"Before I start please do not jump to any conclusions before finishing my story. I (22yo female) have been dating my boyfriend (23 yo male) for almost a year and half. My sister (32 yo female) recently joined a neighborhood watch group about a month ago and in it she can see registered offenders in her area. About 2 weeks ago she asked if my boyfriend and I could watch her kids (9 female, 4 female, and 3 male) while she went on a work trip. We agreed because I love spending time with my nieces and nephew and they always enjoy their sleepovers with us. My sister decided to put our address into the offender website and noticed that there was a dot very close to me when she clicked on it she realized it was my boyfriend. For some background my boyfriend is a level one and we have been in the process of trying to get it removed for a few months. A month after his 18th birthday he decided to have car sex with his girlfriend at the time in a dark parking lot a week before her 18th birthday. They got caught and because it was sex in public and she was technically a minor at the time while he was legally an adult he was placed on the list. He was open and upfront about it when we started dating and his girlfriend at the time is the daughter of his family friend so we’ve all met and hung out together. She’s even been helping us in his petition to be removed from the registry. I feel that it wasn’t my business to tell. seeing as it didn’t involve children or any non consenting parties I shouldn’t feel the need to tell others. It was a stupid thing that a lot of teenagers do when they’re young and sneaking to have sex. When my sister found out she invited me to her place and told me. When I told her I knew she kicked me out without letting me explain things to her. She blocked the both of us on everything and has told our family group chat that I have knowingly let a ped*** into their homes and around their children. Despite not name dropping she has made post on social media obviously about our situation and one of my friends sent me a post she made that said “It’s disgusting and sickening that someone can date a ped*** and give them access to their families and friends children. Anyways I pray that my sister focuses more on her faith than a hopefully terminal relationship.” This has caused many issues and made things very uncomfortable for us. I have had some family members reach out to me for answers and upon explanation of the situation they understood where I was coming from and have agreed that my sister has been dramatic and should’ve listened to me before going this far. Other family members (mainly the gossipers) including my mom feel like I should have said something even though it doesn’t really affect anyone. My dad isn’t a fan of it but he understands where I’m coming from and has tried to get my sister to answer my calls or atleast take down her post. My boyfriend understands how important my family is to me and has told me that he understands if I want to break up. I told him that I don’t and won’t because a dumb mistake he made as a teenager won’t be the end of our relationship especially since it was my choice not to announce it to the world. If we broke up I would have some family members who would still try to hold it against me and it would be unnecessary heart ache. Ive been trying to ignore it but he see’s that it does hurt and bother me. His family has been very nice in inviting us over more and not talking bad about my family despite knowing the situation and how my sister has been attacking him on social media.

76,1cstzku,AITA for not giving my friend a ride to her car every night?,"I have a friend/coworker, ""Ana"", that chooses to park in our works ""extended parking lot"" instead of the regular lot. It isn't very far by car, but it is quite a lot of walking considering we work a rather physical job. We get off work late into the night and it is not the safest area (it's actually the most dangerous county in the state...) so I elected to give her a ride to her car a few times since I worry about her. Now, Ana tends to follow me to my car, expecting me to give her rides to her car every night, never asking, just expecting.

Eventually it started bothering me so the first thing I did was ask her why she parks so far? Her answer was, ""there is never any parking closer"". However this is a blatant lie as we arrive to work nearly the same time every day and I watch her pass a dozen spots on her way to the extended lot. I called this out as well as told her is just isn't a safe area to be walking so far by yourself this late at night and asked if she could just park closer. She blew me off, continuing to park far and follow me to my car each night. 

The final straw was yesterday after work, We were walking to my car with another close friend of ours who parked next to me. Our close friend asked who would be taking Ana to her car tonight, throwing out a playful game of rock paper scissors. And it set me off and I guess I blew up. I told her I'm not driving Ana to her car anymore and I'm tired of her safety being solely everyone else's responsibility. Sure it hurts to say this but I'm tired of feeling obligated to take her every night.

Now this is where I feel especially bad, Ana didn't take what I said very well and responded with, ""I can't believe you. I gave you rides to and from work for WEEKS and you can't give me a 2 minute ride to my car each night? Even on days you called out, I still came to pick you up! You're so selfish!""

(Note: I did not have a car at the time. I did pay her for her services VERY WELL and I let her know HOURS before our shift so it is not possible for her to still come to my house) 

I honestly didn't know how to respond to this but luckily our close friend calmed the situation by giving in and giving Ana the ride.

I am no longer sure if I'm an asshole or not.. It would only take a few minutes of my time to keep her from getting kidnapped OR WORSE. But her constantly blowing off the risk of parking so far is quite frustrating.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-15,"AITA for not giving my friend a ride to her car every night?

It isn't very far by car, but it is quite a lot of walking considering we work a rather physical job. We get off work late into the night and it is not the safest area (it's actually the most dangerous county in the state...) so I elected to give her a ride to her car a few times since I worry about her. Now, Ana tends to follow me to my car, expecting me to give her rides to her car every night, never asking, just expecting.

Eventually it started bothering me so the first thing I did was ask her why she parks so far? Her answer was, ""there is never any parking closer"". However this is a blatant lie as we arrive to work nearly the same time every day and I watch her pass a dozen spots on her way to the extended lot. I called this out as well as told her is just isn't a safe area to be walking so far by yourself this late at night and asked if she could just park closer. She blew me off, continuing to park far and follow me to my car each night. 

The final straw was yesterday after work, We were walking to my car with another close friend of ours who parked next to me. Our close friend asked who would be taking Ana to her car tonight, throwing out a playful game of rock paper scissors. And it set me off and I guess I blew up. I told her I'm not driving Ana to her car anymore and I'm tired of her safety being solely everyone else's responsibility. Sure it hurts to say this but I'm tired of feeling obligated to take her every night.

Now this is where I feel especially bad, Ana didn't take what I said very well and responded with, ""I can't believe you. I gave you rides to and from work for WEEKS and you can't give me a 2 minute ride to my car each night? Even on days you called out, I still came to pick you up! You're so selfish!""

(Note: I did not have a car at the time. I did pay her for her services VERY WELL and I let her know HOURS before our shift so it is not possible for her to still come to my house) 

I honestly didn't know how to respond to this but luckily our close friend calmed the situation by giving in and giving Ana the ride.

I am no longer sure if I'm an asshole or not.. It would only take a few minutes of my time to keep her from getting kidnapped OR WORSE. But her constantly blowing off the risk of parking so far is quite frustrating.",0.0,0.024983946233987808,0,1
77,1cstxpn,AITA for moving away from my friends?,"I (26F) have always wanted to stay where I grew up. I liked my hometown. I loved my childhood home and I loved my friends. That being said, I recently moved to a different state to follow my family.

I grew up in a northern state. I went to college locally and had a career I loved. I still have that amazing job, just working remotely from out of state. I had an additional part time job at a local place before I moved. I made lots of friends there. We’ll call the two important ones Jackson (25M) and Chris (20M).

My family moved to a southern state when my youngest sibling graduated high school. My parents had wanted to move since before I was born. Our home state was expensive and it was only getting harder. I found a roommate and was able to stay. My friends were super supportive.

After a few months, I began to feel very lonely. My friends were less available and I was used to being surrounded by family. My parents hated leaving me, but had supported my choice. I eventually decided to move. My friends and roommate all seemed supportive, and I planned to host a hangout the night before I left with free food.

Here is where I might be the asshole. I asked Jackson if he would mind helping me pack everything into my car. Jackson was hesitant because (like me) he enjoyed sleeping in and I understood, but he said he would try. I was talking with Chris a couple of days later and learned Jackson was more upset about my move than I initially thought. I texted him that evening to let him know I would figure it out, thinking he wouldn’t have to worry.

Jackson texted back to complain that I was leaving all of my friends behind to move thousands of miles away for family and leaving a great job. I replied I wasn’t trying to cause a fight and I was keeping my job. I love my friends, but I missed my family.

The texts went on until he admitted that everyone else had something, but I was his best friend and I was leaving. He also mentioned his poor mental health. I felt bad and I still do, but I was making a decision to be with my family. None of my decision had to do with my friends being less available. They all have their own lives and why should I outrank that? It wouldn’t be right to pin my issues on them.

I wasn’t able to see Jackson at the last hangout because he couldn’t make it. One criticism Jackson had was that whenever someone disagrees with me, I get upset. But this was a life changing decision for me and I think I have a right to be upset when a close friend tells me I will regret it and want to come back. He thought I was sensitive.

I’m 2 years past my move and I like it here. I made the right decision. I don’t think I want to go back to my hometown after everything. I have nothing to go back for. Sometimes I get a random text from Jackson. I only stayed in touch with Chris. Everyone else has gone quiet. I have friends from childhood that I talk to daily who think Jackson was out of line.

at the time our grandma passed away (april 2023), my sister completely spiralled, ran away from the hospital, got beyond wasted, and picked a fight with me. she called me an orphan not once, but twice, during this fight. she also went ballistic on my fiancé, too, because he was trying to find out where she was so he could go pick her up, and then blocked his number. needless to say, i blocked her at the time so we could both have some space to grieve and chill out. 

flash forward another 10 months. my wedding has been planned, invites have gone out, and she emerges again. she tells me she’s sorry, that she’s been sober since that day, and that she wants to reconcile our relationship. at this point, i am SO thrilled, because she’s my big sister, and i want her at my wedding, sober. i welcome her back into my life instantaneously, and mail her a wedding invitation. 

two weeks later, she finds out that i didn’t invite anyone else from our family, and she loses it again. i explained that our wedding is very small, and we only invited people who are actively in our lives to a) keep the cost down, and b) make the event more intimate. she finds this completely unacceptable and tells my family that my partner and i are getting married on x date and didn’t invite them, and then proceeds to tell me that “weddings are a joke”, and that she’s not coming because she’s “going to book a holiday to the beach instead.”

obviously this was wildly upsetting for me, my own sister doesn’t want to come to my wedding. she told me she wanted to be a better big sister and be there for me, so i’m feeling pretty bamboozled by the emotional rollercoaster.

My mom has always been against drugs, more so recently. She doesn’t see my ADHD as a problem, she thinks I could deal with it simply with caffeine. She told me it was “my choice” and to just do my research, so I did before deciding I want to go on medication. 

I thought it was fine, but when I asked her to make me a follow up appointment to determine if I need to up my dosage or change medication she told me to really try caffeine instead. I told her that I can’t stand drinks like Mountain Dew or other carbonated energy drinks (not to mention they’re horrible for me) and I hate coffee, it makes me gag I hate it so much.

86,1cssesd,AITA for hiding our father's death from my brother? ,"My 3 brothers and I (F) spent our childhood in Europe with our parents. When I got 12, our father got a job offer in Africa. So my younger brother and I moved to Africa with our parents. My two older brothers stayed in Europe for their studies.

After a few years, my brother Paul graduated as a pharmacist, and now he wanted to come and live with us in Africa. He was always very close to our father, he wanted to live closer to him. So Paul moved in with us in Africa.

But to be a pharmacist here, he had to do an extra year of study. European diplomas are not valid in Africa, it is necessary to make an equivalence.

Paul had been studying in Africa for three months when Dad got sick, so the family moved back to Europe so that our father had the best treatments. My brother Paul stayed in Africa to get his equivalence diploma.

Dad passed away in April. Paul had 2 only months of study left. Mom decided not to tell Paul about dad's death. Studies are important, and she didn’t want this to disrupt Paul’s studies. She asked my brothers and me not to say anything either. It may seem impossible to hide such a thing, but it was very easy. At the time, there was no internet, nor even mobile phones. Calls betweet 2 continents are also expensive. Also, Paul speaks very little and does not ask questions. Some people think he has autism.

Anyway, we all listened to mom. In June, Paul had his diploma, he returned to Europe, and Mom had to tell him everything.

Years pass, and none of us ever got back to Africa. We all got married and had children. All our children get along really well and the family has always been very close.

Our mom finally passed away recently. Paul had a severe depression after mom’s funeral.

2 days ago, I received an SMS from Paul’s daughter, Ane(26). She had just learned what we had all ""done to her father"", and she is furious (and rude). She says that at the funeral of grandmother, when they opened the family vault, Paul saw her father’s coffin for the first time, and that it's our fault. She is convinced that this is the origin of her dad's depression. It’s stupid and I know she's just trying to find a culprit. Paul never talks about it. In 30 years, he never blamed us. I'm sure he understands why we lied to him at the time. Paul was able to grieve anyway, even though he did so two months later than the rest of the family. It’s ridiculous to think that seeing a three-decade-old coffin can cause such a serious depression.

At first, we chose to ignore Ane’s SMS. But yesterday, my two sons accused me of having chosen to preserve Paul’s studies by not telling him anything at the time.

87,1css1i4,AITA for refusing to give my friend $200 and insulting/dismissing his mental illnesses?,"So I, 17F, have a friend. He is also 17 and transmasc. In middle school, before covid, we were apart of the same friend group. He came out as trans in 8th grade, and in 9th grade, when schools opened after covid, I didn't wear a mask, it was optional. We got into an argument about this, which shifted to an argument about my parents. He believed they hated him and were transphobic, and I was okay with their behavior. I told him that they aren’t transphobic, and they just don’t understand trans people. They have never been rude to him, I think he was just upset they won’t let me sleep over at his house anymore (because he is a boy now).

At the beginning of sophomore year, despite the fact I am straight, I got asked out by a girl at homecoming and I felt pressured to say yes. It was very awkward for both of us, and we agreed not to date after. Yet Afterwards, for over a year, rumors flew about me dating that girl, and many other of my female friends. I eventually, in my junior year, traced it back to the boyfriend of my trans friend. I asked him multiple times to stop, yet new rumors were still coming up and he always acted creepy about it.

I ended up finding my trans friend after school and yelling at him. I knew his parents were getting a divorce and there were screenshots of him begging one of the popular guys in my grade to date him. I insulted him too, I just yelled and yelled. And I was right, he was behind the rumors, telling his bf to spread them. 

The next day, I actually felt terrible about what I said. Yet I was still so angry after getting the confirmation I wanted, that I refused to let myself apologize to him. Here’s where this conflict starts. About a month later I get a very long winded text from him. 

Essentially, he said he thought I was a “closeted lesbian” who was being suppressed by my religious, conservative and abusive parents. He said he wanted to make it easier for me to come out, and that he loved me as a friend. He went on to list a string of mental illnesses he supposedly had, including Anxiety and BPD. He told me that he had a panic attack after I yelled at him. According to him, he dropped his phone into his pool because of his panic attack.

Honestly, I don’t even know how much I believe this story, but he claims the repairs cost him $200. I texted him back and said that story was absurd, and quite harshly I told him that I didn’t believe a lick of it, and even if it was true, I said it was his problem not mine, and that he should just use the money he spends on testosterone to buy it instead. I also mentioned that I don’t believe he has all of the mental illnesses he claims to have. Additionally, I just started a part time job about a month ago now, so I am suspicious that perhaps he is asking because of that.

(TW: Mentions of abuse, and toxic friendship) 

I (18f) am planning on having a birthday dinner at a restaurant with my friends for my 19th bday. My friend (18f) assumes she is being invited, though she doesn’t know that I’m even doing anything atm for my bday. Her bday is a week after mine, so she considers us “bday twins”. We were going to do the “Guard the bday girl” TikTok trend, that was months ago. She was down for the idea at first, but then she said “Well what if we go to Vegas for our 21st bday, instead?” No. I’m planning for our 19th birthday, not 21st.

Anyways, that made me upset, so I decided to let it go and plan it later. We have reached later. I am planning invite 10 friends (5 from home, 5 from college). Which already, is a lot of people to invite to a restaurant that doesn’t take reservations. Also, my 10 friends that I invited all like each other, but college friends haven’t met her 

If we celebrate our bdays together, she will want to invite here college friends too, which will overall make it around 20 people. I would be humiliated walking into a restaurant with 20 people. So If I were to invite her, I’d suggest for it to be MY party and then we can do something else for her, but with her, she most definitely wouldn’t let that fly. She always tries to make everything about her. I.E At prom, she faked sick for attention. And, she self diagnoses mental issues and makes them her personality. So if I would invite her, I already know that she would do that to get the attention of everyone else. Another issue is, she makes jokes that simply are not funny, and I’m not saying “quirky” shit. I mean, she looked me in the eyes and told me “my dad died” after her dad got in a motorcycle accident, and said I overreacted when I gave her my condolences. 

Her bf is as bad, but for different reasons. 
First off, he is uncomfortably protective of her. They are the “your little pussy belongs to me, tell daddy what you want” discord couples. They act like this IN PUBLIC. I am NOT dealing with that. He also tries to one up everyone over everything! From drinking, smoking, whose life is worse, who is stronger, etc. He argues to argue, but in such a ruthless way. Now my best friend (19nb), was abused terribly as a kid and makes jokes about it, but few and far between. My friend’s boyfriend also had a bad childhood, so I already know that he will try to one up them, and I’m not okay with that

“op just don’t invite your friend and her boyfriend.” I wish it was that easy. If I don’t invite them, she will freak out, and start a huge fight. I feel guilty about it bc she can be a sweet person, but I just can’t hang out with her in groups because of how she acts. I thought about having a day for us, but that wont slide with her.

However at lunch, my mom asked about my girlfriend and how was she doing and that my gf seemed intimidated by her. I replied with “oh she’s fine. She just doesn’t like some of the things you’ve said about her”. my mother was then perplexed and annoyed that I even told my girlfriend what she said about her and started yelling at me in the restaurant. Admittedly, I probably shouldn’t of said anything but cat was out the bag and told her that I’m annoyed she’s mad when she was being rude to my gf. I kept telling her we should drop it but she didn’t and we stormed out the restaurant yelling. This then went into the car where she started yelling at me  about how I hurt her and she feels betrayed and I was yelling back saying she tells her sister stuff personal things about me all the time to which she replied “that’s different; she’s family”.

Just for context, my mom has said some rude things about my gf to me and my sister such as her having high voice and mocking her voice and calling her a blue haired liberal to my aunt (she doesn’t have blue hair). However at lunch, my mom asked about my girlfriend and how was she doing and that my gf seemed intimidated by her. I replied with “oh she’s fine. She just doesn’t like some of the things you’ve said about her”. my mother was then perplexed and annoyed that I even told my girlfriend what she said about her and started yelling at me in the restaurant. Admittedly, I probably shouldn’t of said anything but cat was out the bag and told her that I’m annoyed she’s mad when she was being rude to my gf. I kept telling her we should drop it but she didn’t and we stormed out the restaurant yelling. This then went into the car where she started yelling at me  about how I hurt her and she feels betrayed and I was yelling back saying she tells her sister stuff personal things about me all the time to which she replied “that’s different; she’s family”. My mom and I aren’t speaking to each other right now but just wondering if I was in the wrong here. Thanks yall

92,1csriny,AITA for not opening door to old friend ,"So I already feel pretty content with my actions but I wanted to get peoples feedback on if ITA.

Little back story is I am a female in my early 30s. All throughout my 20s I had a friend group consisting of guys and girls who I hung out with regularly, some of us closer to each other than others. We all knew each other for years but looking back some of them were just people I partied with a lot and hung around but weren’t friends I confined in or had deep connections. Anyways one male friend moved away to another state 5 years ago. In those 5 years I stopped talking or interacting with him and a side note-when he was living here and we hung out he said a lot of hurtful “jokes” towards me about my body or race. So I essentially phased him out of my life after he moved away. 

Fast forward 5 years later and apparently he moved back here. He sent me a message saying Hi which I ignored. Then one day he was blowing up my FB messenger asking if he can come over and hangout like 6-7 times. Before I debated answering the message or not, all of a sudden he was at my front door knocking and yelling my name. On top of that he had a woman with him that I didn’t know…

I didn’t answer the door and he eventually left but I found that insanely odd and invasive? We have not spoken or interacted with each other in years. I understand you are back in town but I obviously have shown no interest in reconnecting. The part I failed at was communicating that I wasn’t interested in hanging out or bringing you back in my life, but it was like a stranger (5 year no contact) just showed up with a random person.

I come from a family where we discuss issues openly regardless of whether it hurts feelings or not and my husband's family literally never talk about issues and they just bottle up and bottle up causing all this hidden resentment. We've learnt to find a middle ground in our marriage. My husband's parents also have a pattern of making very reckless financial decisions in search of ""greener grass""  and don't really take accountability for the effects that it has on their children. They like to blame it on the fact that life is hard and they're 'trying their best'. They have also made a few questionable decisions regarding their one daughter who I am so close with I consider her a sister, not sister in law. 

Anyways, I called them out on quite a few incidents that took place and how they have never created an environment where their children feel comfortable to express how they feel with them. I acknowledge that I was very angry when typing this message. My husband then went afterwards and acknowledged that my tone was harsh but everything I said was factually correct and I am addressing issues that he and his sister have never felt comfortable addressing with them. They completely attacked us and are questioning my husband for marrying such a ""horrible woman"" and saying marrying me was the worst mistake he has ever made, his mother is also saying she has never approved of me. They also got upset with my sister in law questioning where I ""got my information from"". They even have his grandmother and aunt turned against me. 

I eventually apologized to them because I was shocked that they chose to block out their children because of what I said and tried to make peace for my sister and husband's sake but my husband has asked that we rather go no contact.

I originally went to college at the “University of Iowa” (not really, went to a comparable school). Due to personal reasons, I dropped out of school and came back home. After a year or so, I started over at a community college and I just completed an Associates Degree this past December. I have now gained acceptance to “Iowa State University” (not really, going to a comparable school) and I have been going there since January.

I told my friends and family that I graduated from community college, that I received my diploma in the mail and that I was walking in May. But after that, I didn’t bring it up anymore. And in result, my best friend and my sister didn’t realize I was walking. They’re upset I didn’t tell them.

A part of me didn’t want to make a big deal about it because it was community college.

For example, my best friend spends like 30-40 minutes talking about his relationships issues with his boyfriend every time we talk extensively and will listen for maybe 2 minutes about things concerning me. I kinda feel like if you’re my sister or my best friend and you know I finished a degree program recently and know that I got my physical diploma and know that I was walking in the spring, then if you cared enough, you would’ve asked what date I was walking.

95,1csr5yf,"AITA For not inviting my ""attachment parenting"" friend out & insulting her?","For context, me and four friends all had babies around the same time (within about six months of each other) and the babies are all between 12-18 mo. My son is 14mo and my ""attachment parenting"" friend's son is 18mo.

When we were all pregnant we decided we would not ever let being a mom take over our lives, we'd continue to hang out and have normal relationships, etc. Four of us have maintained that fact. We hang out regularly.

When her son was about six weeks old our friend devoted herself fully to attachment parenting. We all realised quickly that she was happy to be mom and only mom and we were excited for her. I tried it myself after hearing her talk about the bonds and things but it's just not for me. I enjoy having breaks and sleep training saved my sanity lol.

She is completely controlled by her son. We would invite her out initially but we were always met with a no - it was too late in the day, usually. We typically enjoy hanging out after bed time but her son can't cope without her so she can't attend. 

The day time ones we planned she couldn't attend because they arentbaby friendly and he won't settle. 

Basically her son needs to be with her 24/7 and we do not want to escape out kids to hang out with hers so we recently, as a group, stopped inviting her out with us. 

She is obviously upset and is claiming we're not being understanding - shaming her for her parenting decisions. Which I understand how we are, but on the other hand, it's not hard to understand that we want to spend time child free and that includes hers too.

It all came to a head a few days ago when we were having one of our toddler play dates and the kids were all playing - I mentioned going out for drinks that night and she made a comment about wishing we'd plan these things earlier in the day for her.

I told her that we do it because we want it to be child free. She claimed we were purposefully excluding her.

I told her that she only gets so upset over it because she's created a clingy monster of a toddler and can't escape him. 

I was aggressive, and immediately apologised, but I'm tired of tiptoeing around her when she's created this situation herself. He won't die if she leaves him at home. She can come hang out if she wants; she just doesn't want to deal with a tantrum. 

She got reallt upset, obviously, and ended up leaving early.

Our other friends think we should start planning events so her son can just hang out too - obviously we miss spending time with her, but I don't think she should get to bring her son. It's not a mom evening if she's got a toddler screaming for the breast all evening.

We are in our mid 30s with two kids under three (6 month old and 2.5 year old). 

So we're all hit with a nasty stomach flu. First the baby vomiting and diarrhea around the clock, and now the toddler and the both of us. I've been sleeping maybe 2 hours a night for the last 3 days. To say this has been the worst I've felt physically and mentally is an understatement but my job as their mom doesn't stop, so I'm powering through. We all have the same virus. We are all having the same symptoms. 

I was in the kitchen cleaning bottles and making the toddler some soup because she has been vomiting all night. I asked my husband to take the baby out of a standing station and place him sitting on the ground with some toys. He heard me but ignored me as he continued to groan on the couch. I didn't repeat myself. Finally he put the baby down on his back which he hasn't been happy about. I told him to put the baby sitting up right. He heard and said the baby is fine, to which I said, no he'll cry. He ignored it and when back to the couch. The baby started fussing and I just lost it. 

I called him a piece of shit. I screamed that he'd let me down as my partner in every single way. In front of our kids. He yelled at me and said why are u fucking cleaning, called me crazy and told me I'm a piece of shit back. I ran away in tears.

I don't think he's a piece of shit but I'm so hurt and angry and it just came out, and I did feel let down in that moment. I feel so much anger and resentment because I feel like it doesn't matter if I'm sick, I still have to do everything. I'm mostly ashamed I did this in front of my toddler. She understands a lot.

Now, I'm feeling guilty, wondering if I should've just gone to make Alex happy. So, Reddit, AITA for saying no to going on a trip with my partner's friends?",0.0,-0.0025860772002488375,0,1
99,1csqus1,AITA for telling my cousin that the baby name she picked is an insult?,"
I (25F) attended my cousin Ellie's (27F) baby shower and gender reveal party. It was a lovely event and things went off without a hitch. When the baby's gender was revealed (she's having a boy), Ellie also told everyone about the name that she and her husband had picked. I thought nothing of it as the name isn't anything unique or strange in anyway. Her now last name is a bit unique but nothing that would attract attention or ridicule. She hadn't told me prior to the baby shower which names they were thinking of.

After the baby shower, I went home to my boyfriend and I's apartment and told him about the baby's names and gender. He laughed. When he stopped, he explained that the baby's first and last name when said together is an insult in another language.
When I asked him for the translation, he got his phone and said it would probably be better to show me. He called one of his friends and he was put on loudspeaker because he was with some of their mutual friends. His friends hadn't even said hello when he said the baby's names. The reaction was instant. They all started shouting and cussing him out, all the while my boyfriend is laughing his butt off.  I got the phone and told them the situation, asking what the names meant, I knew all the people who were there. They also burst out laughing. When they stopped, they apologized, cussed my boyfriend out again and explained the insult and it's severity. It is a VERY big insult in a  language that they speak which is rare here but is a major language in a specific part of the world. When the names are put together, it's the kind of insult that can immediately start fights. It's not said as two separate words but it's one word even when you split it up, it's still obvious that it's that particular insult. It basically talks about a person's mother's private parts. They all suggested that I tell my cousin because while there's no guarantee that the baby will ever meet someone who speaks the language, it would be better to atleast inform Ellie.

On Sunday my boyfriend and I went to go see her with her favorite snacks hoping that it would atleast help put her in a better state of mind. We chatted and had fun and after a while when we saw that she was happy, We as gently as possible explained that the baby's name is an insult and its meaning. She was absolutely livid. Ellie yelled at us saying that we were trying to ruin the name she had picked out and called me spiteful and jealous. We tried to explain that we meant no harm or disrespect but she wouldn't hear us out and told us to leave. Shortly after, my family and several friends started messaging me saying I was cruel for upsetting Ellie. I don't think we did anything wrong but the backlash is a lot.

He's an incredible person, but one thing that I always have found annoying with him is that he never lets me know beforehand when plans are delayed of even cancelled. Now, I understand having an emergency and not having the time to send a quick message; never happened to me, but there can be circumstances. However, the longest he's gone without doing something like this was 5 months... And it's because nothing was planned during that time, we were quarantined.

104,1csqe6o,AITA for telling my half sister it’s her fault for her rocky relationship with our dad,"I have an older half sister who is 30. She’s from my father’s very brief first marriage. Her mother cheated on my father while he was deployed in Iraq and they divorced after only 2 years of marriage. My father met my mom during the divorce filing process and they married just a year later and have been married for 26 years. 

My dad’s ex wife HATES my mother for some reason. I think it’s because she’s under the impression my mom “stole” my father from her. That being said she also trashes my father a lot as well. 

My half sister lived with us for a few years when I was growing up. Given the huge age difference between us (13 years) I never got to speak to her as much nor was I close with her until I got older. When she was 15 she threatened to end her life if my father didn’t let her live with her mother instead. Of course they relented and she was given back to her mom. This changed her, my dad’s ex wife basically ruined my half sister’s relationship with my father from the sidelines. My sister didn’t make it any better from the things she said and the fact she always disregarded my father despite his best efforts to keep up a good relationship.

Recently at my older brothers college graduation she made some comment along the lines of “Can’t believe you weren’t this excited for MY graduation,” she meant high school graduation, she never went to college. My father tries to explain but he’s irritated at her for saying it in the first place. She sulked about it and said “is this why you don’t like me?” 

To which I replied, “No, you are the reason he hates you, it’s your fault your relationship is the way it is,” 

I felt bad after saying it since she stormed off afterwards. Am I the asshole? 

Edit #1: I’ve heard most of the things about my older sister from my father. Not from my mother. She doesn’t really have an opinion on my half sister, they never got along despite my mom’s efforts. I’ve noticed that my siblings have the same fragile relationship with her as I do despite them being older. As the youngest it shouldn’t be my business but I’m honestly tired of her acting like my father was abusive to her. He wouldn’t hurt a fly, he’s never laid hands on us at all. 

Edit #2: I’m still a child. I’m gonna trust my father over some strangers on the internet. Just because your relationship with your fathers failed that doesn’t mean mine has to!

I currently work 1-on-1 with a 23 year old boy with special needs. He has a job in an elementary school cafeteria, so I take him to work and before and after his shifts, I usually spend time with him at his home. They have 2 dogs, a big Doberman and a small little white mutt. The Doberman is insane. He jumps around and is constantly trying to play fight, even with me. He’s not very trained so he uses his teeth a lot and while not intentional, always damages stuff/people. My client himself has gotten various injuries from this dog while they play because he bites a lot, or his claw gets stuck (most recently in the boys eye). Monday afternoon, I was sitting in my usual spot in the living room and the dog was running around, jumping off furniture and flying through the room. I was avoiding him because I hate when he does that. Suddenly he’s running full speed at me and jumps on the chair I’m in, and launches himself in the other directions. In this 3 second period, he scratches me all over my face and neck. It hurt, but while I was driving home, I realized that my face was bleeding. I got home and looked as though I got beat up, red marks and blood all over. It didn’t even feel that bad, but it looked crazy. I took a picture because I was so shocked. My husband was pissed that I came home looking that way. I texted the boys mom to let her know what happened, because I feel like that’s standard to do.

Here it is common for the fianceé to go to the salon with her brides and other close friends, take pictures together etc. We all go together to visit a hair salon in a big cityA, next to my family cityB,  personally I thought the price was ludricous and thought my fiancee would think it too (my mistake, I should have asked). My family also thought it was expensive, but that there were a lot of good options at our smaller city, where the prices are better, without sacrificing quality. Now comes another ""mistake"" by my mother, my fianceé is making her dress at cityB, my mom would be responsible to take the dress and get it to the salon, she mentioned if both were at the same city it would be easier, because to go to another city, the dress would take the whole back seat and we would need another car for my sisters. She was trying to show the advantages of cityB, but because of her comment from months ago about her finantial help, my fianceé took this badly.

My fianceé got angry that none of them, and worst of all, me did not ask her what she thought of the salon. She said she did no want to go to my family city and I agreed, and said the decision was hers, it was her day. So she decided to go to cityA with her friends. As expected my mom and sisters said they understand it but it was expensive for them, and they would do their hair and makeup at cityB.

Now she said that she does not want my mother to pay for the candies anymore, because after my mom helps with something it is with strings attached, and mentioned her commentary from months ago and about the wedding dress. On a subconcious level, I believe she is feeling guilty choosing a place she knew my sisters could not afford, becuase they helped a lot with the planning, so she wants to cut further help to feel less bad, but this is just me trying to play the psychologist. I don't think there is an amicable manner to say I don't want my mother's help, she probably would not expect and would get disappointed and sad. I told my fianceé that I'm okay to not accept further help, but I won't say to my mom that I also don't want the help we already had agreed upon.

115,1csphjw,AITA for letting a friend's place be damaged to the tune of a couple thousand?,"for a brief background, i'm staying at the unused condo of friend A for about half ($250) the going rental rate ($500). i take care of the place and get a discount, he gets a hassle free tenant.

recently the neighbor situation became a problem but friend B came home from overseas (work situation) and we had a mini reunion sort of with A and a bunch of others. B has an unused condo near A, better location and amenities, and the going rate is about $800. thing is, it's been sitting empty since he left because he can't find a tenant he can trust. because of that, he had to come home to renovate it because of issues with being empty (smoke alarm going off for no reason, termites, a window that broke and let rain and all the elements inside and no one noticed for months) and fixed it up for a significant amount. i offered to move to his place for the same deal i had with A (with permission from A of course), half the going rate ($400). he said sure, we can check out the place the next day, and discuss it.

i went on an ocular of the condo and i liked it enough to say i could move in ASAP.

recently the neighbor situation became a problem but friend B came home from overseas (work situation) and we had a mini reunion sort of with A and a bunch of others. B has an unused condo near A, better location and amenities, and the going rate is about $800. thing is, it's been sitting empty since he left because he can't find a tenant he can trust. because of that, he had to come home to renovate it because of issues with being empty (smoke alarm going off for no reason, termites, a window that broke and let rain and all the elements inside and no one noticed for months) and fixed it up for a significant amount. i offered to move to his place for the same deal i had with A (with permission from A of course), half the going rate ($400). he said sure, we can check out the place the next day, and discuss it.

He knew my stance of not getting an abortion if anything happened and I knew he didn’t want a baby. We were dumb with our decision making & of course I ended up pregnant. After I got pregnant, we stayed in touch a bit and still went on a trip we had previously scheduled before I got pregnant. (He easily could have canceled, as the reservations were in his name + he told me I didn’t need to contribute to the cost)
 
About halfway into the pregnancy I offered him to sign his rights away. He didn’t want to commit to that. We started working on creating an agreement but it would always end in fighting (him saying he didn’t want this). 

He did not come to the birth + adamant about being off of the birth certificate. After the baby was born he visited twice (he lives in another state) + voluntarily started sending $500/m (I never asked but was appreciative). I was adamant about getting this in writing so there is accountability. He was always “busy” or would start a fight so that way we ended the conversation (telling me this is my decision to have the baby and he didn’t want it). I offered we could meet with an attorney and split legal fees. Again he would procrastinate. Eventually, I was fed up and gave him a deadline before I would take Matters to my own hands.  When I got an attorney, that burned the bridge with him. he no longer checked on our baby And became hostile. so we really haven’t talked in over four months and he hasn’t seen the baby in over six months

I just received the proposed agreement that was made by my attorney. I know he’s going to be livid when he sees the child support worksheet recommended  $1300/m. I know he didn’t want the baby, but he also made the decision to be involved in the beginning. Now that I went to the attorney he no longer wants to be involved. 

Am I the asshole for holding him accountable since ultimately he decided to be involved and keep the recommended  amount or should I advocate to stick to what we have been doing, $500/m. My friends all think I’m dumb for even thinking about lowering his amount but it would be nice to have some unbiased opinions before moving forward. Maybe I am dumb. You can tell me that my feelings won’t get hurt lol. 

Edit to add more details: 

I went through an attorney which means we had to do a paternity test and he had to fill out a discovery questionnaire. This was filed through the courts. He got an attorney after he was served a paternity test order. This is my attorney’s attempt at an out of course settlement. I am not familiar with the legal terminology. 

Also, I don’t “need” the money. I have a college education, a good paying job, and stable life. This isn’t a debate whether or not I should have given the baby up for adoption or had premarital sex.

123,1csoqag,"AITA for looking ""too"" like my twin? ","Backstory: I have a twin (16F) and we are most of the same classes at school. We arent identical however we look very similar so many people cannot tell us apart. Me and her are also very shy so we really only talk to a few friends. Growing up together means I have most of the same friends as her, it doesn't help I'm in the same classes as her at school.

Also in most of our classes, there are these two twin boys (17M I think). I have personally never had a conversation with them as I'm quite shy but they have both seemed to have something against me and my twin for no reason ( ironic right!). In our class the other week, my friend overhead both of the BOY twins talking about us: saying we always dress the same, having the same stuff, we are weird (because of the things listed before I'm guessing).

 This took me off guard as in school we have to wear a uniform anyway so how can we possibly dress different? Also they have never seen me and my twin out of school uniform ( apart from special occasions where we get to wear our own clothes) so I dont know why they are making these untrue assumptions considering we do wear different clothes when we go out. The fact the boy twins are both recounting an event that happened a year and a half ago ( I wore the same jeans as her for one day) does not make sense to me at all. Probably being quite shy doesn't help but I don't understand why that makes me 'weird'. I know I'm  pretty attractive too so it just makes me question why they care so much about clothes. 

Also, me and my twin do have different pencil cases bags etc and jellewery but we do wear the same type of coat ( literally every girl in our school has the same coat). I don't understand where this sudden 'hatred' has gone and the fact they are talking behind my back is disrespectful.

It continued by both of them saying they couldn't tell us apart. Keep in mind they are both identical themselves so they look really similar. It is annoying when people can't tell us apart considering I have been in a class with them for like 6 years but the fact they are twins I  thought they would at least try.

I know me and my twin (16F) are similar but that doesn't take from the fact we are separate people. 

I might BTA as I could change some differences (e.g style my hair differently) and i could be more social to others but why should I change my hair for some insecure twins? I guess as we are twins we do stand out but they are twins too.

Am I the asshole or are my feelings valid?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-15,"AITA for looking ""too"" like my twin?  Backstory: I have a twin (16F) and we are most of the same classes at school. We arent identical however we look very similar so many people cannot tell us apart. Me and her are also very shy so we really only talk to a few friends. Growing up together means I have most of the same friends as her, it doesn't help I'm in the same classes as her at school.

Also in most of our classes, there are these two twin boys (17M I think). I have personally never had a conversation with them as I'm quite shy but they have both seemed to have something against me and my twin for no reason ( ironic right!). In our class the other week, my friend overhead both of the BOY twins talking about us: saying we always dress the same, having the same stuff, we are weird (because of the things listed before I'm guessing).

 This took me off guard as in school we have to wear a uniform anyway so how can we possibly dress different? Also they have never seen me and my twin out of school uniform ( apart from special occasions where we get to wear our own clothes) so I dont know why they are making these untrue assumptions considering we do wear different clothes when we go out.

124,1cson9o,AITA for not paying my girlfriend half the price of her car before getting insurance,"Just to start off this is a throwaway account. 

Me and my girlfriend are going to be moving in soon and the issue over the car has suddenly come up. 

For background, I share a car with my sister and we both get similar amounts of use out of it. My girlfriend on the other hand owns her own car which she bought several years ago. 

My girlfriend and I take turns over who drives, and when it is my turn there is rarely an issue with my sister and the car is usually available. 

When I moved in with my girlfriend the plan was to swap my insurance onto her car and I would split all the ongoing bills with her going forward (while paying in full for my insurance etc. with her). As such it would be of no additional cost for her to have me insured on the car. Also, as it is her car I would let her know she always has first choice if we both ever needed it at the same time. And if she ever sold the car she would get to keep all the money. 

However, I have just found out that my girlfriend wants to value her car and ask me to pay her half of its current value (which will be several thousand euros). After which I will be allowed to swap my insurance and split ongoing bills etc. She has brought this up now and we are only a few days away from moving in and she has said she would resent me if I got insured on her car and didn’t pay half the value of it. She mentioned she planned to use the car until the value is nil and therefore I should have to pay her half its current value as she would not be selling it. 

From my point of view this seems unreasonable, the only time I drive is when I am with her so if I get insured on her car I will not be adding much mileage and therefore not devaluing her car a lot. 

In addition, the apartment we are moving in to is only 10 minutes from where I currently live. So I can still continue to use the car I share with my sister if needed. So from my perspective I would just be throwing away thousands of euros unnecessarily. 

I feel like what she is asking for is unreasonable. If the roles were reversed not only would I not expect any money from her for the value of the car, I would outright refuse it. And where would the line be drawn, if I brought a tv or couch that I owned to the apartment should I value that and get her to pay as well?

A little background story is I used to live with my dad, stepmum, boyfriend and my two brothers. My boyfriend came to live with us about 3 months ago because my parents said he should as he had gotten kicked out of an abusive household. My dads household wasn’t the best, he’s an alcoholic and he has bad anger issues and gets angry really easily and quickly. He had lost his job because of his anger and he stopped paying rent which caused us to move in with his now girlfriend. Her house was three bedrooms.

I would stay up most nights crying because they started treating me really badly. 
My stepmum did not treat me very well either, i would get blamed for most things and when i spoke up i would get threatened to be kicked out. My dad rarely talked to me also.

127,1csnbpl,AITA for not giving ticket to my partner for my graduation (26M) (26F)?,"I graduate soon from my professional degree (masters and higher) and there are three ceremonies. The school I go to is a top school and I don’t think I’ll do another degree program again. Very big moment for my life (come from underserved background). My school gives limited tickets so I’m letting my immediate family go to the first two ceremonies. The last one is a ceremony where I can’t even walk and I don’t feel like going as I found out from alumna it isn’t worth it. 

My partner (26M) and I have been dating for almost two years (LDR), I do love him but our relationship is hitting a rocky point. As of recent, we’ve been getting in fights about his lack of boundaries with his family.  Essentially, we can have plans but the minute his mom snaps her fingers I’m pushed to the side. He’s incredibly indesxive to the point where it affects my day to day (anxiety). One time his aunt (he claims distant aunt but idk) said racist things about those of my background and he didn’t say sorry until after she left! He claims I’m a priority but disappoints me every 4 months. We are in a big fight right now because a work trip for my job was in his city and I asked weeks ago if he was free the reminder of the week (my job is super lax with extending flights ). He confirmed with me then 2 weeks before he says it’s mothers days and he has to leave. I tried to communicate if he can leave Sunday morning but he insisted on leaving Saturday morning (claimed he would consider but he didn’t). My job wouldn’t let me change my flight. I was left alone the whole weekend and felt sad. I could’ve been with my family. His sibling accompanied him so his mother wasn’t alone. This isn’t an isolated incident (recurring theme). He also didn’t invite me along at all. I told him how I felt afterwards and he said he gave me notice. To me, it wasn’t a kind thing since this is the 3rd or 4th time this theme happened. 

He really wants to go to my ceremonies but understands that tickets are limited. He knows about the ceremony of the least significance and it’s taking it personally that I haven’t given much planning for him to come. I don’t feel like going to that one at all. 3 ceremonies is a bit much and I don’t walk in that one. I feel I’m bending my boundaries to make him happy. I’m moving away from all my friends from my program and if he comes I’ll be mainly with him and through the weekend (I move away the end of the weekend). I’ll miss out on my final goodbyes with friends and mentors. I also feel bitter about the recent events that happened. Getting into and graduating from this program is something I could never imagine. I love him but I don’t want MY moment to be about him especially after recent events.

I told her he would never feel like a dad to me since i only knew him for 6 months. That made her more mad than she already was. She told me I wasn't aloud to leave my room until I was ready for him to be my dad. I didn't think that I was fair so I left and went to my dad's and haven't talked to either of them since, AITA here?",0.0,0.015854911878705025,0,1
131,1cslyvk,AITA for calling out my husband for skipping our sons Birthday completely with no real excuse?,"My husband skipped our 8yr old sons birthday and then when he finally got back to us it was a  text and all he said was ""just saw your message"". I had texted him 5hours prior and called him many times on all his numbers We waited at the kids venue for hours until closing. I even saved him a plate of food. We though something happened to him as he had never gone a whole day without replying. 

When I confronted him, he said ""its okay no worries"". I was shocked with how nonchalant he acted and reminded him how we waited and how I had called all his numbers. Then I told him he should atleast apologize to our son as he was sad for what happened. And he replied ""apologize for what?"". I told him for missing his birthday. And he replied ""dont start"". I was surprised and I replied that I am not starting anything but that we were all disappointed and we were worried that something happened to him and our son was disappointed and sad and if he didnt care about us then he didn't deserve us worrying for him and I said goodnight sir.

He didnt care and replied good bye as well basically deserting and ghosting us like he always does. He has since not reached out to us or the kids its been a week

132,1csltnk,AITA for Yelling at My Friend for Trying to Scam/Underpay Me for My Pokémon Cards?,"Am I the asshole for yelling at my friend for trying to scam/underpay me for my Pokémon cards?

I (17) put a Pokémon card on a second hand item selling website. the specific card i was selling was a 2019 188/181 250 HP Rainbow Incineroar. I was selling it for $5 USD, as my ‘friend’ (17) is a ‘professional Pokémon card who knows what they’re doing’ (their words, not mine). After 1-2 weeks of no one buying it, my friend kindly offered to buy it from me for $10 USD, as even though it was a bad investment, they wanted to be nice. I told them i wanted to wait for 1 more week, and if no one bought it, I’d sell it to them. They said, ”Are you sure? Fine.”

1 or 2 days later, someone messaged me on the selling website and said, “are you sure?” i said, “Yeah, why? Do you want a lower price?” Apparently, a PGA 8 (the condition they approximated my card to be) 2019 Rainbow Incineroar actually is worth about $45 USD on most websites, which meant my friend was underpaying me by $35 USD.

The next day, at school, I brought this up with that friend. At first, they tried to say that “The person messaging is mental” and “It’s not true”. When I showed him the screenshots of the prices of the card from eBay and other purchasing websites, they said “So? At least i was willing to buy it from you!” and told me to f*ck off. i said, “But why were you trying to underpay me? You could’ve just asked me to sell it to you for less!” I ended our argument by saying “I will, asshole! Who gives a shit about my damn Pokémon cards anyway?” We haven’t talked for 2 or 3 days, and it’s been really awkward.

However, all of my friends who I asked about this said “Aren’t Pokémon cards just all pieces of shiny cardboard anyway?”, which meant “The fact that (friend) was willing to pay you $15 dollars in the first place is insane!”, so I don’t know what to think of their advice. Keep in mind I’m not upset that they wanted to buy it from me for cheap, but that I’m upset that they didn’t just tell me and tried to pretend that they were doing it out of kindness.

134,1csle7c,AITA for not acknowledging my friend’s new boyfriend when inviting her to my wedding?,"I (28F) got engaged to my fiancé (29M) two years ago. We started planning our wedding over a year ago, and our wedding is set for August 2024. We both have large families and big friend groups from college, so it has been difficult to keep the guest list relatively small (under 200). 

We decided to only give plus ones to friends in serious, long term relationships (a year or longer at the time we began planning the wedding). Over a year ago when we made our guest list, my friend Holly (26F) had been single for a while. Obviously we did not give her or any of our other single friends a plus one, and Holly is a part of my friend group from college so she would have plenty of people to hang out with at the wedding. 

A few months ago, I caught up with Holly and she shared she had started dating someone in August 2023.  My fiancé and I sent out our invites recently, and last week, Holly and I met up for lunch and talked about the wedding. She very casually asked if our other friend would be bringing her boyfriend - I said yes, but mind you, this friend had been together with her boyfriend since around the time we made the guest list. 

After lunch, she sent me a long text saying that she understands we can’t give everyone a plus one and wedding planning is already hard and stressful, but she felt a bit disrespected by the fact that I didn’t acknowledge her new relationship at all or bother explaining why she didn’t get a plus one. She claimed in the text that she doesn’t mind her boyfriend not being invited, but thought the respectful thing to do would be to send a quick text or bring it up in person that I would like to meet him another time but don’t have a spot for him at the wedding. She felt that by not acknowledging her relationship at all I was “invalidating” it. 

I was not made aware that I owe everyone an explanation for not inviting their new partner, who they didn’t even know at the time I made the guest list.

she’s just broken up w her ex, and met this new guy (red, 22M) within a couple weeks of breaking up, and they got together when the new taylor album came out. this is relevant bc im a huge fan and she isn’t, so most days she controls aux.

i’ve expressed concern about the timeline, but ultimately i’ve just given in & want to make sure i’m supportive bc at the end of the day, she is her own person.

i met red for the first time last week after blue and i drove home from the office and picked him up on the way. yesterday, we did the same thing and went out to get food. then ended up going back to my place to chill afterwards. but on several occasions, they’d just begin making out in my kitchen or on my couch. i live in a small apartment so i said hey hope no one’s making out rn as a joke and they broke apart in their giggles.

it got late so they went home together, and then blue asked if the next day, we could drop red off on our way to the office. this was about a 45min detour but i woke up earlier and did this no problem. when i got to here to get them, blue came into the car and plugged her phone in immediately, cutting off my music, expressing hate for it, and then went to sit in the back seat w red.

unfortunately for me, my rearview was right on them, and i had a 45min drive stuck in traffic, watching them make-out.

afterwards, we got through the work day until lunch. it bothered me the whole time, so i confronted her, “this is a bit awkward for me to bring up, but i just wanted to talk about this morning, just with how you and red were making out in my car this morning, and as well last night in front of me on my own couch, that made me uncomfortable and i just don’t think it should happen again.”

to this, blue straight giggled. i repeated: “no, i don’t think it’s funny, i’m being serious, it made me really uncomfortable.”

and she rolled her eyes and laughed, “fine. that’s fair. no more making out for me.” holding her hands up in the air, but she kept waving it off as if she’d done nothing wrong. maybe i should’ve just gotten over it from here?

we moved on afterwards to get through the work day, then it all kind of sank in when i got home. i told some of my other friends about it & my boyfriend as well. they’re all upset, especially my younger brother who thinks she’s being manipulative and entitled.

138,1cskvor,AITA for throwing cigarette ends back over my neighbour's fence because she has kids?,"So, our neighbour (23F) is an absolute NIGHTMARE- we got on at first but once the following situation happened, she turned volatile and unhinged. “Jane” is a single mother with a 5-year-old & a 4-month-old. It’s just our two houses connected and our front gardens are connected with no fence/wall boundary. Important to note she has family and friends very locally that come round a lot. 

So, a few months into living here, my partner (29M) and I (24F) go to tidy our front garden and notice there’s loads of cigarette ends. Neither of us smoke and neither does Jane but we have seen the mum (visits a lot) smoke out the front of the house a lot and usually has a cup used as an ashtray. We assume she’s thrown them on the floor or the cup has knocked over and the wind has blown them into our garden- annoying but no biggie. We look closer and there are A LOT of cigarette ends, not just a few so I politely text Jane informing her of the situation and ask if she can come and clear them up as there are quite a lot. She replied bluntly saying they aren’t hers. I replied I know she doesn’t smoke but we know her mum does and say again I know it was probably the wind blowing them but there are quite a lot so can she come clear them. She says her mum doesn’t smoke out the front- only the back, I say we have seen her out the front smoking, she then says her mum puts them down the drain (illegal where we are). I replied saying can you please just come sort them out and she never replies. We don’t put a time limit on it but we leave it a week and no-one comes to clear them up. We contact our local council about them (in case it happens again) and they said take pictures, bag them and count them and then return them to Jane. So that’s what we do… 

42 CIGARETTE ENDS!! My partner (I’m disabled) goes outside to clear them up after a week. I was stood near him and about halfway through Jane leaves the house with a guy & the pram and they both stopped, stared at us and then just walked off. When we’d finished, taken pictures etc. we wrote on the bag “42 cigarette ends”, sealed it (Ziploc bag) and threw it over the back garden fence into their garden. A few hours later she comes home and finds them, takes a picture and messages me saying “Thanks for throwing these in my garden knowing I have children”. I then pointed out that they were in a sealed bag and that originally, they were all loose in her own garden where her child could have picked them up, eaten them etc. and I asked her a week ago to pick them up. 

For additional context, Jane has always been abusive to her kids (we’ve heard and seen a lot) and we were constantly contacting CPS and all sorts so her saying we don’t care about her kids is a joke because we cared more than her (I don’t know if Reddit will let me say what she’s screamed at them).

I was stood near him and about halfway through Jane leaves the house with a guy & the pram and they both stopped, stared at us and then just walked off. When we’d finished, taken pictures etc. we wrote on the bag “42 cigarette ends”, sealed it (Ziploc bag) and threw it over the back garden fence into their garden. A few hours later she comes home and finds them, takes a picture and messages me saying “Thanks for throwing these in my garden knowing I have children”. I then pointed out that they were in a sealed bag and that originally, they were all loose in her own garden where her child could have picked them up, eaten them etc. and I asked her a week ago to pick them up. 

For additional context, Jane has always been abusive to her kids (we’ve heard and seen a lot) and we were constantly contacting CPS and all sorts so her saying we don’t care about her kids is a joke because we cared more than her (I don’t know if Reddit will let me say what she’s screamed at them). I also have enough drama from this neighbour I could write a GD book!!

I was been looking for a new backpack to take to work and I noticed his backpack. His backpack is everything I have been looking for in a backpack and is perfect for my needs. I went ahead and purchased the backpack at the weekend. 

The issue is is that both of our bags are the same colour and we sit next to each other. 

We have had a few issues this week where we have got confused as to who's bag is who (he even started going home with my bag yesterday before I realised!) and it has been causing us issues. 

I know it doesn't sound a big deal but I am a very private person and I don't want him going into my bag. 

I suggested one of us attach a tag of some sort to the bag to signify which bag is which. As his bag is older and more faded I thought it would be fair if he was the one to attach something to the bag. I don't want to do this to my bag as it is brand new and it would ruin the look. 

He is refusing to do this and is saying that it is my problem as I decided to ""copy"" him and get the same bag as him. I think he is being completely unreasonable.

148,1cshtzc,"AITA for scolding my husband in front of his children, parents and in-laws?","(Throwaway account because my husband knows my main account)

The title sounds messed up already, but hear me out. I (34F) live together with my husband (35M), two children (6F & 8M) and his parents. We've been married for over a decade and I love him, but let's just say he's not the easiest to make compromises with and usually hates it when things don't go his way. I'll quickly list a few examples below:

- He has been unemployed for 2-3 years. He's lazy to find a job, but uses the excuse of ""taking care of the kids"" to stay at home everyday.
- He wears only boxers at home everyday (no shirt or shorts/pants), even when guests come over. I told him before that it's inappropriate to dress like that in front of our kids (especially my daughter who's growing up), but he always says ""my house, my rules"".
- He's a very heavy smoker. He usually smokes 2-3 packs a day. The worst part about this is that he smokes INSIDE the house (bedroom/living room). This is despite the fact that his mother has emphysema (a lung condition that can cause breathing difficulties) and that he stays near the kids while at home. I always tell him to smoke outside to protect his mom and our kids from the secondhand smoke, but he says he doesn't care and that he's too lazy to go out every 20-30 minutes just to smoke.
- Because he's unemployed, I have to give him cash everyday for him to purchase cigarettes. Sometimes he'll even demand money from his own parents or my parents if he feels like smoking more. 

The last straw for me came just a few days ago. My parents came to visit us for a couple of weeks. The eight of us were supposed to have a family meal together. I asked him to put some clothes on out of respect for both our parents, but he refused and chose to remain in boxers. I also told him to cut down on smoking while my parents were staying over because both of them are asthmatic. 

To my utter shock, he pulled out a cigarette and lighter DURING DINNER and started smoking AT THE DINNER TABLE. My mom started coughing profusely and she told him to only smoke after dinner, but he got agitated and told her to ""shut the f up"". I was extremely fed up at this point and scolded him in front of everyone, telling him off about all the pointers I listed off earlier.

It's been a few days and he still hasn't talked to me since that night (apart from asking me for money). Was I too harsh on him? Am I in the wrong for scolding him in front of everyone else?

Please give some advice on what to do because I've been feeling guilt-ridden and having trouble falling asleep the past couple of days. Thank you!

EDIT: To everyone who's suggesting me to not give him money, I've tried that before. But he'll just give me the silent treatment and REFUSE to do the household chores until I give in. His parents have tried this as well, but he just threatens to kick them out of the house whenever they do this.",0.0,0.05639153718948364,0,1
149,1cshs0w,AITA for taking out time to meet a friend while my in laws visited us.,"
Recently my wife (32F) told me(35M) that her parents would be visiting us for three days. We live in a god forsaken place which has no tourist attraction or even a shopping mall. The town has a small market which caters for the requirement of locals.mm

Their train was suppose to arrive in the morning at 1000 hrs so i excused myself from my work place and went to recieve them at the station. I drove them home and we settled them in the guestroom. After dropping them home i left for office as i had to finish some work and then came back home in the evening . I spent 2-3 hours with my in laws chit chatting and discussing life in general.

The next day i asked her if she had plans any  for her parents that day and she said there was nothing do in the town so she had not made any plans. I suggested her to take her parents to a well known shop in the city which is somewhat popular amongst visitors, but she refused saying her parents are coming from the capital and they don't need anything from that shop. Then somewhere around 1400 hrs in the afternoon i recieved a text from a friend who had returned from the US and was in town that day and was scheduled to leave at 2200 hrs the same day. He asked if we could meet for an hour or so. Now this person was a school friend of mine and it had been almost 17 yrs since i had met him. 

So i again asked my wife if she has any plans with her parents and she said no. I told my friend that i'll meet him for an hour but then i'd to leave cus my in laws are in town. He was cool with it. We were suppose to meet at 1800 hrs so i left for the rv at around 1745 hrs and met my friend. It felt great meeting my classmate after such a long time and we started reminiscing about school days n what not. 15 mins into our conversation and i get a call from my wife that she was planning to go to the local golf course with her parents but now that i am not there she can't go. I told her i'll be free in some time and she can take her parents to the golf course and i'll meet them directly at the course. To which she responded that i should have never gone to meet my friend as her parents are there for only 3 days and i should have been there. I told her i'll meet her at the golf course as my frind was sitting right in front of me and could probably make out what was being said.

Within minutes i recieved a number of text msgs from my wife (few of them deleted before i could read them) staing that i haven't been paying attention to her parents and i should have been and what not. I had just told my friend that maybe i'll leave in 15 mins and be back with my wife before he leaves so he could meet her as well. But after reading her nasty text msgs i just canclled the plan and stayed with my friend for the pre decided hours duration. Once i reached home wifey was in bad mood and won't talk to me.

My in laws are sweet people and i don't mind spending time with them. But they are not very talkative and most of my conversations with them are filled with awkward silences.

My (F37) mother was very abusing in my childhood. Long into adulthood as well. I’m a scapegoat. When I had children of my own, I noticed the toxic patterns, and decided to go no contact. I’ve been in therapy for over a year, and I’m slowly peeling the layers of trauma. The more I go back, the more steadfast I am in my NC decision. 
My sister (F20’s) is still fully in contact. I had to create boundaries to maintain a relationship with her, but maintain safety from mother. We’ve never really had boundaries before, it was never taught to us. It always felt like we were an extension of mom, so boundaries just weren’t a thing. Privacy did not exist. 
Sis has always felt thrust in the middle, so I said that for my part, I will not bring up mom. I honestly don’t like talking about her anyway. Sis brings her up a lot, and I try to listen empathetically, however, it does trigger me. There’s something so strange about seeing toxic patterns from the outside. I try not to as questions. 
Here’s where I may be an AH. The boundary is, “do not tell mom about my kids.” This boundary exists because mom is a child abuser. I have firsthand experience with this. I have no interest in allowing her access to my children. Well, during a conversation with my sis, I found out she is sharing information with our mom. When I asked, she said, “It’s not much, it’s hard for mom to hear too.” I let her know that that was a hard boundary, and she crossed it.

152,1cshkxr,AITAH for not including my MIL in mother's day activities?,"Using a throwaway for privacy.  

I (33F) recently moved back to my home country with my husband (M36) and our kids (2,5). We lived abroad for 7 years so this was my first mother's day back in our home country where both my mom and MIL live.  

I don't really have a relationship with my in laws mainly due to my husband and them having a complicated relationship (lots of boundary stomping on their part, especially MIL who is very controlling, he had a bad childhood due to MIL not letting him have friends or leave their home for anything other than school and many other reasons). Him wanting to get away from them was the main reason he moved to another country and he had been NC with them for 2 years at one point. Now that we live ~30min apart, we see them every 3-4 months for a maybe an hour and that's about it. My husband sometimes talks to them on the phone, I don't.  

Now, the situation. On mother's day, my husband and kids made me breakfast in bed, kids also drew me pictures. After that, my sister picked me and my mom up and we went to a spa and later a restaurant. My kids also drew a picture for my mom (encouraged by my husband I'm sure). My mom posted said picture and some other moments from the day on social media, which she, just like many other middle aged women, often does.  

MIL saw my mom's post on facebook and called me (for the first time ever) angry crying, blaming me for ripping her family apart and rubbing it in her face on facebook. She thinks I chose the restaurant we went to just to hurt her (it's very close to her home and I did not choose it, my sister did). Apparently my husband did nothing for her on mother's day. Honestly, I didn't think about her at all that day as we're not close at all. Neither did I tell my husband to include her in his plans as he's a grown man.   

I feel really bad about her yelling at me and crying because I hate conflict. My husband told me to ignore it because it's typical behaviour from his mom. According to him, she was unable to get to him so now she's trying to manipulate me into doing what she wants. My sister, however, said I probably should have invited MIL to the restaurant because it's literally 1min walk from her apartment so of course she's hurt now.

I am coming from a third world country, it was really difficult to manage everyone for this wedding. But we did and it was all going well but my mother started getting angry even at the smallest of things.

Not only that she openly insults me and my wife in front of me. Initially I have had a soft soft for my mother as she has no one, my father died and she suffered a lot, then my sister got married and went to a different country and she has issues with pretty much everyone and she physically gets sick and tired when she travels so she sits home all day.  
  
Looking at her behaviour we both tried everything, we tried to talk to her but she kept showing her anger, didn't talk back, or if she talked back she showed arrogance and chose difficult words for both of us to consume.  
  
Now my wife doesn't want to live with my mother, honestly I don't too and I know that my mother will get more and more complicated over time and will say things that will be very difficult to listen to, she did the same thing with my sister.

TLDR: Mother treats me and my wife rudely and doesn't like us doing anything, so we are planning to live in a different house and I feel bad because my father died so she will be alone for the 12-15 days.

Me and my ex have two children together. (F7) and (M6) from the moment they were born their father never showed much interest in his children, preferring to do other things. It was after they were born that I found out that their dad was a compulsive lair. About things big and small, and completely unnecessary. He would exaggerate the most simplest of stories, this is why we split. I ended up having the children, I was happy to do this. I made all doctors and dentist appointments, did all the school runs. Clubs, events at school.
He’s alway had access to all the information I have.
We agreed that we had was that he would have them on a Tuesday and Thursday night. And then every other weekend. 
He was very much a just Facebook dad. 
At first it was fine, by that I mean that even though he was always late, at that point only by half hour but at least he showed up. Drop off would be similar, always late but I managed to make it work.
It then got to the point where the kids started saying things like daddy doesn’t feed us, daddy didn’t get up till lunch so we were by ourselves and. If I asked him about it he would say they were lying. It got to the point where he’d start making excuses not to have them, car breaking down/ working late. and on various occasions wouldn’t get up to bring them home for school. I had to call multiple times. Always the same excuses. Despite my daughter telling me she woke her dad up many times for him to tell the to leave him alone. 
So I stopped the sleepovers. He didn’t care. He got less and less involved with them.
 A few months back he told me that he was being seen by a doctor for Schizophrenia, BPD, bipolar, depression, anxiety and a smattering of other things. And in his own words he was prone to blackouts and fits of rage. I was understandably concerned for their welfare and suggested that until he was in a better place to care for them that he sees them at my house, that would take the pressure off of him. I know the kids would be safe. 
He went from having them multiple times a week to barely seeing them for 20 mins. He constantly lets them down. Is a no show 90% of the time. 
It’s started to really affect the kids. He can’t answer simple questions about their lives. When I try to find out where he is I get ignored. I have tried but nothing works. 
Last night he was meant to come and see them at 5.30, well an hour goes by and I message him saying “late again, I wouldn’t bother coming” I was beyond frustrated and fed up of having to be the one to tell the kids that their dad isn’t coming yet again. 
He starts calling me all names. He’s perfectly able to text me to say these things but can’t tell me he’s going to be late.

156,1csg4dq,AITA for posting about my MIL on social media for Mother's Day?,"I (26f) have the best MIL in the world. I'll never be able to say otherwise. From the time I met MIL when I was 17 and I was just my husband's girlfriend, she has been warm and kind and nurturing and she embraced me as part of her son's life and part of her family from the get go. When my husband and I were in college she would send me care packages and when I came home with him for the holidays she would make sure to have my favorite treats on hand. When we got engaged she hugged me before she hugged him lol. She went wedding dress shopping with me and was there to stand up for me when my own family were... not kind. Having her there made the whole thing less upsetting. She and my FIL were amazing during our wedding and comforted me when I cried because I made the decision not to invite my own family for the reasons of not being kind to me ever and giving me a pretty rough childhood.

MIL was great when my husband and I became parents and she brought over so much food, all my favorite things, and she was a great source of advice.

I could talk for hours about how much my husband's family means to me but MIL hits a little differently for me. I think it's partly because I always worried I would get one of the infamous monster in-law's people often vent about. Plus I think my own family had me expecting the absolute worst. I know MIL had that experience herself. My FIL's parents were awful to her and he went no contact with his family because they refused to be respectful or even civil to her. All they saw was someone who should cook and clean and push out babies for their son.

Anyway, I'm getting a little carried away, sorry. So a few of my husband's siblings are also coupled up or married now. The most recent is his oldest brother who got married four months ago. BILs wife and I are not all that close. I never felt like a problem was there until Mother's Day.

I posted about MIL first thing Sunday morning. Thanking her for being wonderful, for being the dream granny for my kids (2 and 6 weeks) and being an amazing MIL who was the closest thing I ever had to a real mom. MIL gave me the biggest hug when we arrived at ILs house. A few hours later I was alone with BILs wife and she commented that I was so rude for posting about MIL and how I showed the rest of the ILs up who actually have families and mom's to post about because none of them are as close to MIL as me. I told her I did nothing to show her up. BIL heard her and he told his wife to stop and said I did nothing wrong. But she brought it up again right before we all left. I also got an email from my estranged mother on Monday saying I had no right to be so rude and spiteful toward her on Facebook by writing about MIL instead of her.

BIL reached out to me and apologized for what his wife said. But she reached out and made it clear I had made her and the others look bad. And now I'm feeling all kinds of a mess about this.

I thought the reasons were unjustified and misunderstood by the HOD, so I said to Will ""If you had a bit of a backbone, you'd defend my reputation sometimes."" because he stood silent when the HOD vented to him (in a couple more instances too). 


This resulted in a backlash of gossip in my circle. They say I am the problem because I often get myself on the HOD's bad side, and can't stay low, that I can't just follow orders.

I say other admins can do it. HOD gets unhappy and removes me as admin. My colleagues say I should have just said yes, but don't do it instantly. FFS it's a Sunday, Will and these colleagues have been enabling Sunday-work-day culture.


2nd. I'm working with the sound system and microphone, and I'm told on event day to take photos. There are already 2 designated photographers assigned earlier. I took some photos at the beginning of the event, but gradually stopped. HOD is unhappy I stopped taking photos. Coworkers said I should have just kept taking photos (and juggle sound system?), as instructed.

So I bring it up to HOD, but get reprimanded for asking to run extra activities due to a packed calendar. Coworkers say I should've known the HOD is not on good terms with me and the invite coach.

159,1csg0zf,AITA for siding with my friend's teenage daughter over her?,"So a few nights ago I go over to hang out with one of my friends after work, it's me, her, and her 17 year old daughter. 


From the moment I got there I could tell there was some sort of tension between the two of them but neither one of them was really mentioning anything going on. 


After about 20 minutes of putting up with the weird awkward tension I finally just ripped the band-aid off and asked what the hell was going on between the two of them.

Me: she's not wrong. 

Daughter: she's acting like I did this on purpose, I've had that phone forever and it's never had so much as a scratch.

Me: you have had that phone a long time... Wasn't that like an iPhone 7? 

Daughter: no, it was actually an iPhone 6, I got it when I was in fifth grade.

I am turning 18 next year so I don’t want to come off as “entitled”, next year I am fully planning on going on my own trips/vacations and my parents don’t have to pay anything anymore. 

Also, I don’t know if it’s her mental state, but she is drinking quite a lot of alcohol, leaves potato chips or other snacks on her bed (she eats them before she goes to sleep). She has been trying to quit drinking alcohol during the week for a year (maybe even longer) (her goal was to drink only during the weekend) and she promised me she would give me €50 every time she drinks during the week, and she does that.

If they cannot find a space to park their car, they will just park in an empty parent and child bay even though they don't have any kids themselves.

I told them this is out of order and parents rely on these spaces, now we have fallen out.

163,1csf4id,"AITA for laughing at my panicking, injured friend?","I(20F) went on a camping trip with 14 of my friends(19-20 M and F). On our first day, we all decided to go swimming in the lake, a 10 min walk from our camp. The guys were ready before me and the other girls, so they went ahead. 

After 10min, one of the guys came sprinting back screaming saying that everyone was hurt, blood everywhere, etc and to grab the first aid kit. I grab the first aid kit and sprint back with him in my flip flops, loosing both along the way. By the time I get to the lake, I’m completely out of breath and my feet are cut up from running barefoot on gravel. They explain that they went running into the water and almost all of them got cuts on their feet from sharp rocks. 

The cuts were about a couple cm long and barely surface level so there was only a little blood. I was a little annoyed that they made it sound like someone was dying but I helped clean and bandage their feet anyway. Everyone was pretty calm except one guy got a couple baby leaches on his feet and was absolutely loosing his mind over infections, naming all these deadly diseases that they all could have now (ignoring the fact that all those diseases aren’t in our country, let alone in our continent). When I saw the size of the leaches I couldn’t help but laugh a little. I tried explaining to him that it was fine, we got them off super fast and sanitized everything throughly, plus they were only a mm or two big. 

He wouldn’t listen and convinced some of the others to go with him to the park supervisor to get medical attention. The park rangers obviously didn’t do anything but for some reason told them about a doctor camping on the other side of the park. So my crazy friends decided to bother this poor family on vacation, to look at the one guy’s feet. Exactly like I had said, the doctor told him he’ll be fine and that it would completely heal like any other scratch. 

I didn’t know they went on this little side quest until they came back with leach guy complaining that the rangers and the doctor were so rude to not take his injuries seriously. I laughingly told them “Well what did you expect? The rangers are there to handle bears and shit and that family you bothered? They just had some half naked stranger shove his feet in their faces.” I wasn’t saying any of this to be mean I was just joking around about the shear absurdity of it all. Like come on, I understand that some people are germaphobes but if you’re that concerned, don’t blindly sprint into unknown water. 

In the end, everyone was fine. I thought the issue was over until a day after we get back from the trip, I get told over text by a bunch of them, led by the leach guy, that this incident showed them that I’m a toxic person. They said I was insensitive and belittled them for their reaction to a high stress, and potentially health threatening situation. I think that this was blown out of proportion and honestly insane but maybe I am just blind to my toxic behaviour. I am no longer in contact with these people but I have to know, am I the asshole?


Edit: As a clarification, I did politely explain to him that the leaches were harmless and because of the alcohol swabs and bandaging, there was little chance for infection. I only snickered a little when I saw the size of the leaches. I then tried to reassure him that since they were babies and very skinny, they couldn’t have been on long and probably didn’t get any blood at all. He kept freaking out anyway, wanting to save the leaches in a bag so they could be brought to a professional that could determine what kind of disease he contracted. That’s when I actually laughed.

164,1csep97,AITA for reporting my neighbours to their landlord?,"I've been having problems with my neighbours ever since I moved into my house over 2 years ago. Things like arguing all night, loud music, smell of weed seeping into my house, volatile personalities. I've spoken to the neighbour about it on many occasions. We fell out over it about 15 months ago. 

About me: I'm disabled and I keep myself to myself. I've spoken to this neighbour multiple times about the smell of weed in my house which gives me a migraine- just to be a bit more mindful or smoke outside. The houses we live in are old terraced houses in England where the lofts are attached to each other so all she'd have to do is close the bedroom door. 

Onto the noise: currently the neighbour lives with her 22 year old daughter. When I first moved in, the daughters boyfriend also lived there. There was arguing day and night, guttural screaming -the kind where you think someone has died. I called the police on several occasions but to it sounding like someone was being harmed in the house. Screaming things like ""there's so much blood"" etc. Again, I've spoken to this neighbour about it multiple times and I get the same thing: ""I dint like it either, it keeps me awake all night too but I'm not arguing with my daughter"". 

Onto present day. Daughter and boyfriend moved out, broke up, daughters back. She screams on the phone all night and day, plays loud music, smokes weed all day. They have 8 animals in a small 2 bed house. 7 cats and one dog. The dog doesn't get let outside and she never takes him for a walk. He gets yelled at if he moves or barks and basically sits in the daughters bedroom getting hotboxed. The cats are not cared for properly. There are so many in such a small house there's constant territorial fighting, urinating and defecating everywhere. The cats spend most of their time outside trying to get into neighbouring houses. I've had to stop letting them in as I have 2 cats of my own and they were coming in and marking everything. Another neighbour had to stop letting them in because of fleas. They are left out in all weather, ice, snow, rain, they're not vaccinated, they don't have regular health check ups or anything. I built two cat shelters in the back garden so that her cats would have somewhere to go in bad weather.

I've been unwell lately so I spoke to the neighbour again. Said I didnt wanna have to keep chasing her up on this. I don't want to report her but I will if she doesn't speak to the daughter to be more mindful. 

Was basically told ""tough, deal with it, grow up, report me if it makes you feel better"" so I did. I reported her to the police, the local council, and her landlord.

Recently, our college had us do a project making use of database systems (like SQL and stuff). My partner is admittedly far more skilled than me, and proposed a very complicated project that I had zero experience with. Still, I was ready to learn and fully willing to do my part. He said he'd take care of all of the back-end stuff, and that I'd do the front-end. For those who don't know, front-end is essentially what everyone sees when you open a website, the UI for it, while back-end is everything that goes on behind the scenes. 

Cut to a week before the project submission. I finished up what was a decent prototype for the front-end that mostly matched the blueprints I'd designed and shown him and that he'd agreed upon. My partner wasn't too happy though, saying that this was way too simple and that he expected something far more complex from me. I told him I'd never done this before, and this already took me days of work to finish. Still, I did what I could to make it look even better. I sent the code to him, and asked him if he needed any help in combining the two. He remained quiet for a day, until the literal night before the deadline, where he told me he'd work on it overnight.

The day after, he came to college and told me that the front-end didn't work with his code at all. It worked fine with the basic code I'd written for it, but for some reason trying to combine it with the far more complex back-end, it just wasn't working. He apologized for saying I didn't do enough, because it was harder than he thought. Keep in mind, I gave him a fully working code. I did not mess it up in any way in terms of what I was supposed to do.

We skipped our lectures and spent the next few hours trying to salvage it, our submission was in the afternoon. I even remade the front-end using simple HTML so it'd work, but time constraints and other issues meant that even that wouldn't work out. So in the end, he used a basic UI for the project. Essentially, he'd done the entire project while everything I'd done had to be thrown out because it wasn't working.

169,1cscyxj,AITA for yelling at my wife after she almost drowned (because of her own stupidity)?,"Hi, I (26m) have known my wife for (25f) for 7 years. I love and respect her very much, but sometimes I get frustrated at her not thinking in times of emergency. I know she really hates it when I raise my voice (tough childhood) so I am careful about never screaming that's why this is a big deal.

  
Recently we went on a hiking trip for one of her friends (23f) birthdays and there was a waterfall at the destination. We had been sitting with our legs in the water, and some of her friends (the birthday friend included) had been swimming, etc. When we were done and everyone was packing their things, the birthday friend realised that she lost her very nice earring in the water. She is a good swimmer so she was going underwater to look for it. This was a waterfall with currents, and I told them it was just an earring so no point in looking for it.

This is where things get scary. I thought the friend was already being stupid but I didn't want to say anything and my wife forgot her towel so I dried off to go get her things away from the waterfall and the group.

The next second I heard the friend scream really loudly. I turned around and by that time, my wife had already jumped into the waterfall and was moving to where the friend was. But my wife doesn't know how to swim so she was just walking into deeper and deeper water while the friend was screaming. By when she reached her friend, she could barely keep her head above the water (and she is tall for a woman) and couldn't properly breathe. 

Two of their friends who were close by pulled both of them out soon enough, but for me I literally thought my wife was going to drown. She could barely breathe and I am very angry. Turns out the friend was only yelling because she cut her leg against a sharp rock, and that made me even more angry.

When they got out of the water, I couldn't stop myself from just screaming at my wife who was already traumatized from the drowning and she just started crying because of me. Now she has gone to stay with her friend for a sleepover as it was planned but she hasn't texted me once and didn't speak to me at all on the hike down. Her friends have all told me I was an asshole for making her cry after she did something brave but I think it was stupid. What would she have done, she can't swim so they both would have drowned anyway. I respect my wife for her kindness but I think it was really stupid and careless of her to do something like this.

We had been sitting with our legs in the water, and some of her friends (the birthday friend included) had been swimming, etc. When we were done and everyone was packing their things, the birthday friend realised that she lost her very nice earring in the water. She is a good swimmer so she was going underwater to look for it. This was a waterfall with currents, and I told them it was just an earring so no point in looking for it.

This is where things get scary. I thought the friend was already being stupid but I didn't want to say anything and my wife forgot her towel so I dried off to go get her things away from the waterfall and the group.

The next second I heard the friend scream really loudly. I turned around and by that time, my wife had already jumped into the waterfall and was moving to where the friend was. But my wife doesn't know how to swim so she was just walking into deeper and deeper water while the friend was screaming. By when she reached her friend, she could barely keep her head above the water (and she is tall for a woman) and couldn't properly breathe. 

Two of their friends who were close by pulled both of them out soon enough, but for me I literally thought my wife was going to drown. She could barely breathe and I am very angry. Turns out the friend was only yelling because she cut her leg against a sharp rock, and that made me even more angry.

When they got out of the water, I couldn't stop myself from just screaming at my wife who was already traumatized from the drowning and she just started crying because of me. Now she has gone to stay with her friend for a sleepover as it was planned but she hasn't texted me once and didn't speak to me at all on the hike down. Her friends have all told me I was an asshole for making her cry after she did something brave but I think it was stupid. What would she have done, she can't swim so they both would have drowned anyway. I respect my wife for her kindness but I think it was really stupid and careless of her to do something like this.

She was out of sight for a few days and avoiding me so I asked her if everything was okay and how she was doing. She said that she wished she had her own place and more space.  Of course she does, who wants to live with their mother at her age? But it’s California and rent is expensive. I provide a roof over her head while she’s going to school with zero rent. She said she just doesn’t want to talk to me and if she does want to interact she will let me know. She will approach me.  Text her if I have something I need. 

I asked her why couldn’t she just warn me if she was in a mood, let me know and I can avoid her. It’s like walking on eggshells in my own home. She wanted to talk about it more but considering she didn’t think there was a reasonable compromise, I didn’t think there was anything to talk about.

171,1cschrm,AITA for asking my coworker how was his dad after being told he passed away?,"English is not my first language, so please forgive me for the mistakes you might find.

I, Monica(26F) work in automation as an engineer. The company has a total of 4 of us in 4 different shifts. Each of us has also a team of 2-3 people (DWs) to deal with basic errors, while we focus on major issues and improvements. Our plant is active 24/7.

The DWs in each team also have different shifts to make sure the busy hours have full coverage. This means that sometimes I will have a DW from a different team in my shift for a few hours.

Usually all the teams are pretty good and we all help each other to get the job done. There is always an exception tho… I will call him “Tony”. 

He is a DW from another team who shares with me a couple of hours of my shift. We are not in bad terms, but I don’t particularly enjoy working with him.

The reason for this is that he pretends to know the system from end to end, but that is far from reality. (From my point of view) He always makes the same mistakes and when I’ve tried to teach him the correct way to deal with them, he dismisses me saying that he already knew that etc… this has created some tension between us, which I it’s not the ideal.

The real problem started when Tony’s dad passed away. I remember being told about it one day that he didn’t come to work and some one told me he was on bereavement leave because of his dad.

Something that I want to highlight is that I am a distracted person. I don’t know why it happens and I’ve tried to deal with it, but still there are things that I miss out or forget because of it.

Continuing with the story, one day I was in the office, I was very stressed because there was an incident that I had to deal with. I remember seeing Tony walking into the office and then talking to one of our coworkers. I was in the middle of something so I didn’t react till I was done.

What follows after that was the most awkward thing has ever happened to me.

I finished what I was doing, took off my headset and walk towards Tony. I swear I was trying to be friendly, I also didn’t remember about his dad. For some stupid reason the first words that came out my mouth were: Hi Tony, how is your dad?

All of the sudden the room was in silence, Tony was in shock. After a few awkward seconds of complete silence Tony said: well, he’s dead.

I wanted to die. I start apologising and explaining that this is not what I wanted to say and that I don’t know why I said that.
He wasn’t having it. He didn’t say anything, just stared at me and walked away.

The rest of the office started calling asshole and asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

Earlier this year, my dad (63m) asked his mom (85f) if she'd join our car to get there. My sister wasn't gonna come so we have rooms for grandma + her private sitter + wheelchair.  Grandma said no, said his car seat doesn't feel nice for her back (she'd had multiple surgeries for her spine, collapsed discs), so she'd prefer to go with my uncle's (56m) car whose son is the one getting married. My uncle has 4 cars, 1 SUV, 2MPVs, and 1 BMW sedan. My grandma only feels comfortable in one of his MPVs. 

Last month, my sister(30f) who lives overseas asked if there's room for her to attend the wedding. We asked my uncle and he said yes, no worries, so my sister decides to come to the wedding. Last Sunday, grandma suddenly said she'll join our car to get there. My dad said his car is full since my sister will come along. It can't fit 5 passengers + 3 suitcases + wheelchair. The seat at the back needs to be folded if we're gonna bring her wheelchair and all our suitcases. He asked what's wrong with my uncle's car, and she said my uncle told her she couldn't come with him cause all his cars are already full. He told her to ask my aunt (62f) or my dad. My aunt also told her she can't ride with her cause she and my cousin (31f) will tag along my cousin's (37m) car (cousin + his wife + his 2 children + aunt + cousin(f)). She told her to go with my dad. 

Atp, grandma was tearing up, she felt like a burden to her kids. I told my dad we could rent a car + driver for a day and divide the passengers.

She said my grandma should ride with dad, and she's the one who'll be in rental car cause rental driver might not care much about driving for comfort for old people. She said she'll be fine, she'll just have motion sickness pills. 

I can't care much abt my grandma cause she didn't even ASK if my mom would be okay not sitting in front seat. When my dad said she'd sit in middle row, my grandma immediately sniped ""why am I in middle row? [Mom's name] will be in middle row right? I'll be at the front"".

She cared for me as a baby while my parents worked and passed away when I was 7. I was heartbroken and the only one I felt who could truly understand my pain was my grandfather (Nana Lena's son). We grieved for her together and became best buddies ever since. 

My Nana was very sick for awhile and towards the end of her life she expressed that one of her regrets in life was never having a daughter to pass down the family pendant to that was given to her by her mother. I told my nana that I would have a daughter for her so that the pendant could be passed on and she seemed  really happy about that. When she passed my grandfather got the pendant and told me that it will go to whatever daughter I had and it was kind of our half joke/half serious understanding that we openly talked about for years. 

Unfortunately, when I was 12 my dad cheated on my mom and got the woman pregnant. I was so angry at my dad because my mom was dealing with depression at the time and he couldn't care less. He married his affair partner after their daughter ""Jessica"" (22f) was born and I promised my dad that I would ruin their big day if I was force to attend and when they tried to call my bluff I put blue dye in the other woman's shampoo. After that it was made very clear that I would not be allowed back ""home"" until I apologized but I was so stubborn and bitter that it didn't work and my dad didn't want to have to pay a large sum in child support so the threat didn't stick. 

My mom got me into therapy which will helped me process my anger but I forever kept my dad, the other woman, and their daughter at arms length.

My dad's other woman is calling me a thief, that I knew I was wrong which is why I ""hid"" it and is demanding that I give Jessica the pendant as it's rightfully hers and I'm refusing. She never even met my Nana, never expressed interest in learning about her, never once asked about the pendant, and as far as I know has no legal claim as it was technically willed to me. AITA?

177,1csbwgs,AITA for telling my mom that she shouldn't care who I am friends with?,"I (15M) have always had a little bit of disagreement when it comes to certain things with my mom (48F) as we just operate differently. Earlier today I found out that one of my friend (Lets call them Cheese) had cancelled on me last second before we went to go see a play together. I said it was no problem and that if they had more important things to do then they should prioritize that. I asked another one of my friends (Lets call them Ritz) this and they agreed, I didn't see anything wrong with this until a few hours later after I let my mom know about this. 

She said that ""I shouldn't be friends with people like Cheese who cancel things even after being onboard so long. I have friends like that, but they just won't be invited to things from me because I know they will cancel."" She has never met Cheese in person, she has only seen pictures and heard about them through me. She mentioned that ""I should pick better people to be friends with, have a support group and people I can go to when I'm in need.""

I mentioned that ""It isn't Cheese's fault for doing something else that is more important than seeing a play."" She got surprisingly defensive, saying that ""I'm not trying to make you lose your friends, but maybe you could make some better decisions from time to time about who you surround yourself with"" I just couldn't stand to keep listening to her talk about my friends like some deranged criminals.

I haven't talked to her anymore about it, as she has been out for a few hours, so later I will confront her about it. I'm not sure what else to add to this so yeah that's about it.

178,1csbq5r,AITA for asking my devout BIL to be godfather to our heathen child? ,"I am atheist and my in-laws are Catholic. My husband and I have agreed to raise our children without religion, but to me, the role of ‘godparent’ is still very important. My parents are both atheist, but I have godparents. I am godmother to my niece. 

My in-laws are *very* religious, but we have always been respectful of each other. I stand and bow my head at family dinners, I just don’t do the cross thing or say amen. I’ll offer for his parents to say grace in my home. I brought my baby to mass for Christmas and Easter because we happened to be in their town. I display the nativity scene my MIL gifted me among my holiday decorations. After nearly a decade of this, I thought we were all on the same page of live and let live. 

We have become very close with my BIL & SIL and they are very involved in our son’s life. My BIL’s work had them staying as guests in our home every two weeks for the last two years. My SIL and I refer to each other as ‘sister’. My husband and I decided to ask them to be godparents to our second child (in my husband’s family, all siblings have different godparents). We assumed they would be really honoured. 

Last night, we excitedly asked them. My SIL happily agreed and hugged us, but my BIL looked very uncomfortable, didn’t get up from his chair, and just slowly asked questions with a squished face about what that meant because to him, it was a very serious question. It was super awkward. It felt like something between an interview and asking for a raise. It was like we were asking for him to do us a huge favour that he was reluctant to do.

This has eaten away at me all day. In 10 years I’ve never felt like looked down on for not being Christian, until today. It was like he was offended we would ask him to be a godparent with no spiritual aspect. I also realize I’m pregnant and hormonal, but it’s not even clear to me that he agreed. 

I can’t help but feel like his reaction was a slap in the face. I regret asking. If I knew he was going to react that way, I wouldn’t have. We already agreed to use BIL‘s name as a middle name if we have a boy and now that’s the last thing I want to do. It just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. It feels like a stain on my otherwise blissful pregnancy. My husband is very defensive and thought his reaction was fine. I’m embarrassed and angry, but maybe that’s my own damn fault for asking a devoutly religious man to be the godfather to my heathen child.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I accept that I am somewhat TA for my reaction to his reaction. I can’t chalk it up entirely to pregnancy hormones because I am sensitive about being the only non-religious person in this family and I probably overreacted. FWIW, I didn’t express any of my disappointment to him directly, just in chatting with my husband the next day. BIL also did ultimately say he was comfortable with the role after we explained what me meant outside of the spiritual stuff, it just felt forced and I don’t want anyone to feel pressured (and admittedly, petulant me feels robbed of what I thought was going to be a happy exciting occasion).",No A-holes here,2024-05-15,"AITA for asking my devout BIL to be godfather to our heathen child?

180,1csbmus,AITA for not inviting my mum to my birthday party,"My mum got pregnant with me by accident when they were in school, and this caused a lot of problems for both of my parents because they had to continue school while taking care of me. And shortly after I was born my just moved all of a sudden and my dad had to look after me all alone. 

Around last year my mum (31f) suddenly reached out to me (14f) and my dad (31m) and asked if she could meet me. So I started seeing my mum every month and met my grandparents and they were all very nice to me.

My dad kind of hates my mum, like he doesn’t say it but it’s obvious when he never wants to be near her and is reluctant every time I go meet my mum. And I learnt that it’s because my mum was a drunk when they were younger and was a really bad person. But I think she’s changed now.

In a while I will turn 15 and I’m going to have a small party to celebrate, and I’m only having my granny (my dad’s mum) and my best friends over. My mum found out it was my birthday soon and called my dad to ask what we’ll be doing and he told her that she didn’t need to come. 

And my mum was mad and her parents called me and my dad to try to convince us. So my dad asked me if I wanted her there and I honestly don’t think we’re close so I said no.

Now my mum is really hurt and she doesn’t want to meet me anymore because she says she needs time away from us. When I called her only her parents pick up and they told me to leave her alone. 

I feel bad because I think she’s really hurt and I don’t know if I should have sucked it up and just let her go to my party.
