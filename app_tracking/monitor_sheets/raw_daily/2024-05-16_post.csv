0,1ctj9qx,WIBTA if I didn’t come out to my family as trans?,"I (14M) have known about me being trans for about a year now. I’m comfortable with myself and thinking about myself as a guy (using non-binary/transmasc pronouns) has helped me with my gender dysphoria a lot. 

My mom’s side of the family is super supportive with LGBTQ+ stuff. I’m also bisexual and going to pride this weekend with my best friend, so I’m planning on testing the waters when I see them next and telling them I’m bi. But I know they’d be chill with me being bi or trans, they’re just really nice people and I’ve always felt comfortable around them.

My dad’s side, however, is pretty dysfunctional and I’m not sure if I’m going to tell them. My aunt was always the favorite, which has caused a lot of issues between my dad and his parents. My aunt’s kids are also horrible and my aunt expects me to help her with a lot of stuff, even though she was never there for me during my childhood.

My grandma is in her 80s and my grandpa as well. My grandpa is in the midst of a really bad depression (he has been for a year) and we’re not sure how much longer he’ll be in it for. And although they’re not against queer people, my grandma is pretty Christian, as well as all of my extended family on that side.

My parents want to move north in a few years, so I’m honestly thinking about not telling my dad’s side. I don’t want to tell my grandparents and cause further strained tensions between my dad and his parents, especially since I’m not sure how much longer they have left. My aunt and uncle also don’t really like us anyways, so I don’t want to ruin any remaining relationship between my dad and his family in the last few years we’re staying in state.

After we move, we’ll probably not have a lot of contact with my dad’s side as they’re not extremely close anyways. I still feel like it’s an asshole-y thing to do, as I’m trying to transition from FtM early (I’m practicing voice changes, dressing more masc, and having a high T diet so when I finally get on T it’ll be easier for my transition) so they might have their suspicions, I just won’t confirm it.

1,1ct2zhq,AITA for laughing at a joke someone made about my SIL?,"I (27f) have been married to my husband (29m) for 2 years. He has an ex wife (Allie- fake name,29f) and he and she have two kids together, a boy and a girl. We all get along really well, even if we aren’t doing family dinners etc like some co parents do. 

This story is about my brothers wife, Caitlin (also fake name, 19f). My husband and I recently had twins (b/g) and sadly our son didn’t make it. It’s been a long couple of months with our grief and having my first baby, after a rough pregnancy. 

My brother is in the army, and while he’s doing some training, his wife is staying with us, because they’re moving soon after he’s finished. It was fine at first, until Caitlin started making little digs about me. That I haven’t lost the baby weight, if I don’t want to stay my size I shouldn’t eat xyz, etc and when my stepkids are here, she once remarked that “it was good my husband managed to get at least one son.” She’s careful to only say these things where I can hear them and no one else. It’s gotten to be a lot to take. I’ve spent a lot of time crying over the things she’s said to/ about me on top of still grieving my son. I haven’t told anybody what she’s been doing just because I don’t have it in me to have one more thing for people to feel bad for me about. Until this past Friday. 

Friday afternoon, Allie dropped the kids off for the weekend, and while I was standing there talking to her, I guess I looked really upset (Caitlin had just made another crappy comment). And I ended up telling her everything. I told her the last thing Caitlin had said about my weight before Allie and the kids got there. Unfortunately (for Caitlin at least) Allie has a complete lack of what you’d call “give a fuck”. Caitlin walks into the room and I’m teary eyed and Caitlin makes a comment about me being whiny. Allie immediately fires back (with a tone I’ve NEVER heard her use) with “you know being a pick me bitch doesn’t burn calories. If it did maybe you wouldn’t look like a beluga whale.” 

At first I was stunned into silence but before I even realized it I had started laughing. Caitlin immediately starts crying and leaves the room. Allie goes home, and I get a call from my brother telling me I’m terrible because apparently Caitlin had an ED in her younger teenage years and I was insensitive to that by laughing at allie’s mean comment. While I tried to explain to him that she’s been making nonstop comments towards me he didn’t care and kept trying to call me out on it.

4,1ct29cx,AITA for calling out my husband’s family as alcoholic assholes?,"AITA: Family

My husband has been away from home for almost 2 weeks working in the city he is from (6hrs away).

He has 7 siblings (all over 50 so we aren’t taking young families). When he called his family a month ago to say that he was coming into town and would like to see everybody his family members all offered to have him stay with them and told him it would be silly to get a hotel. Therefore, we didn’t book a hotel. 

He planned to do a rotation of about two nights at a few sibling’s homes.  

My husband is a recovering alcoholic and they are all well aware of that. He has had some serious health concerns due to his previous drinking so it is crucial that he remains sober. He has been attending AA while out of town and doing well. It is literally life and death for him.  

He arrived on a Thursday and on Friday night the sister that he was staying with planned to get together barbecue at her home. Everyone was drinking to the point of drunkenness and it made my husband uncomfortable so he went up to bed after a few hours. He did not expect them to not drink in front of him but enough is enough after a while.

After that, his family decided that that was so incredibly rude of him and said that they wouldn’t be changing their lifestyle to accommodate him. After he finished two nights at that sister‘s home (morning after the bbq) all of the other family members said that they didn’t feel comfortable with him staying with them. We’ve spent about $3000 in hotel rooms thus far. 

My husband owns his own business so it is not like he can apply for corporate lodging reimbursement. 

ONE sister called (who was out of town at the time) me at work and when I couldn’t answer texted me I needed to call her ASAP and scared me half to death until my staff meeting was over. Turns out she was mad my husband went to bed after a few hours (like 9pm) even though she was not there to even witness it. 

Once I returned her call and realized that it was not an emergency. My blood began to boil. I told her how rude and inconsiderate. Their family wants to sit around and drink bottles and bottles of wine at an event that was supposed to be celebrating a visit from their brother who lives out of town and only visits once or twice per year. 

I also said that it was a really asshole move for everyone to say that he made them uncomfortable and they no longer wanted him to stay at their house. I said I’m sorry that my husband sobriety cramps everyone’s wine drinking, beer chugging style.

6,1ct1t9r,AITA for getting into an argument with my wife over dog poo?,"My wife and I live in a HOA (which sucks), but we follow the rules. One of the rules is to pick up after your dog as a common courtesy to your neighbors. My wife 44f and myself 40m also have a dog whom I walk and clean up after.

We live in a decent neighborhood and I like to work in my yard and take very good care of it. I also spend a small fortune on it by treating it, weeding it etc. I came home today from a long day's work and found myself drinking a cold beer while walking over the lawn and enjoying the view. I have been working on this yard for six years and have turned it around from the previous owners who really didn't take good care of it.

I was walking through my yard and I stepped on a big pile of steaming shit, which you can tell came from a large dog. I immediately get upset about it and clean it off of my shoes and then clean it from my yard. I was so upset about it that I had to go inside and chill for a minute.

I'm a bit paranoid about home security so I have cameras all around my house on the outside. I did some investigation and found out who didn't clean up their dog poo. After fifteen minutes I have the clip of who let their dog shit in my yard.

I told my wife I was going to walk down the street to the neighbors which is three houses down and confront them about this. I was going to be polite and ask them to clean up after their dog and hand them their dog's big pile of shit. My wife immediately starts to tell me not to do that and that she doesn't want to start a neighbor war. I start to get a little snippy and raise my voice a bit saying, ""These are the rules and I want to let them know I caught you and have them apologize for it!"". 

The part that really upsets me in the clip is that the owner of the dog was about to pick it up with a plastic bag. You can see clearly in the video (which I don't know if I can post it here) that the neighbor bent over and acted like she was cleaning it up. I think that is where I was even more upset about the situation. She had the bag and all!

My wife starts to get really upset that I want to do this and walk down and just have a conversation. She then states, "" We don't want to do anything because they might get upset and turn you into the HOA."" I disagreed with her about this and stated that I wanted to do it anyways and I did. I politely went down there and asked them to pick up after their dog and that I didn't appreciate it. The husband got his wife who was the one that pretended to pick it up. He apologized and so did she.

My wife 44f and myself 40m also have a dog whom I walk and clean up after.

We live in a decent neighborhood and I like to work in my yard and take very good care of it. I also spend a small fortune on it by treating it, weeding it etc. I came home today from a long day's work and found myself drinking a cold beer while walking over the lawn and enjoying the view. I have been working on this yard for six years and have turned it around from the previous owners who really didn't take good care of it.

I was walking through my yard and I stepped on a big pile of steaming shit, which you can tell came from a large dog. I immediately get upset about it and clean it off of my shoes and then clean it from my yard. I was so upset about it that I had to go inside and chill for a minute.

I'm a bit paranoid about home security so I have cameras all around my house on the outside. I did some investigation and found out who didn't clean up their dog poo. After fifteen minutes I have the clip of who let their dog shit in my yard.

I told my wife I was going to walk down the street to the neighbors which is three houses down and confront them about this. I was going to be polite and ask them to clean up after their dog and hand them their dog's big pile of shit. My wife immediately starts to tell me not to do that and that she doesn't want to start a neighbor war. I start to get a little snippy and raise my voice a bit saying, ""These are the rules and I want to let them know I caught you and have them apologize for it!"". 

The part that really upsets me in the clip is that the owner of the dog was about to pick it up with a plastic bag. You can see clearly in the video (which I don't know if I can post it here) that the neighbor bent over and acted like she was cleaning it up. I think that is where I was even more upset about the situation. She had the bag and all!

My wife starts to get really upset that I want to do this and walk down and just have a conversation. She then states, "" We don't want to do anything because they might get upset and turn you into the HOA."" I disagreed with her about this and stated that I wanted to do it anyways and I did. I politely went down there and asked them to pick up after their dog and that I didn't appreciate it. The husband got his wife who was the one that pretended to pick it up. He apologized and so did she. 

After all of this my wife is upset at me. I don't feel like I did anything wrong but wanted to stop something from happening again by owners of pets not taking responsibility for their pets' droppings.",0.0,0.9452711,1,0

I recently saved up enough money to buy my own used car. The problem is in my state you have to be 18 in order to have your own insurance ( unless you’re on ur parent’s insurance).  
My parents do not want me to drive alone because “ you don’t have enough experience “, which is true I don’t but how am I supposed to gain those experiences w/o driving alone. 
So, today, I told my mom that I found a car within my budget and if she could add me to her insurance I can give her the money for the extra cost every month. She proceeds to say that “ let your dad help you buy a car” but I responded “ I don’t want him to help me”. Somehow this made her furious. She said I was disrespectful for declining help from her parents and that because im turning 18 , I want to do what I want. Which is partially true because im an independent person. I never depend on my parents for anything. I got my first job at 14 and saved up since then. Somehow the whole car argument turned into you’re acting “grown” and we can’t talk to you anymore, so I should move out when I turn 18 or she can kick me out now 
Which shocked me because everytime I talk about leaving for college next year, they are opposed to it? Either way, im so confused on why they are so upset that I want my independence. The reason I want a car is because whenever I ask anyone to take me to work or if I miss the school bus it’s a whole hassle for them.

My now ex best friend sophias (f17) birthday was yesterday, she told me last year her birthday was on mother's day, so I assumed its the same this year (I honestly had no idea mothers day was a different date every year, I struggle paying attention specifically to dates, and months, I barely know what month it is currently all the time.

Pastel pink washes me out completely.

The pastel pink dress made me look like a washed-out ghost, and I knew there was no way I could wear it on Jessica's big day.

16,1ct0wcu,AITA for refusing to housesit for my brother?," 

I have an older brother who has been very good to me over the years – the biggest example is about 10 years ago he gave me $50k so I could graduate college without debt. We’re not as close as that gesture might make it seem, mainly because he moved states several years ago and we hardly saw each other, but he recently move back to our rural hometown – about 1.5 hours from my tiny house in the city, and we're starting to get closer again. 

About six months ago I had a fully remote job. My brother asked me to house sit his dog and two cats while he went away for 2 weeks (the animals can’t stay with me because my housemate is allergic). I agreed and it was horrible – he had a rat infestation (apparently my brother didn’t know, somehow) and I had to beg another friend to let me stay with them while the exterminator did his thing. I was terrified of the rats so I couldn’t stay put. Not to mention the dog particularly was a lot of work, we went for 4 walks a day and the dog's not very friendly so I need to keep a watchful eye. 

About three months ago, it was a similar situation, where my brother asked me to house sit for one week and I agreed again. My brother assured me the rats were gone, and indeed they were (although I was paranoid and thought I could hear them in the walls), and otherwise there was no incident.

Now my brother is going away for two weeks and wants me to house sit again. Here’s the thing though: I have a new job that is in person 4-days a week (no longer a remote job like last time), and staying at his house would mean a daily 2.5 hour commute (roundtrip), plus the animals would be alone for 8 hours at a time (the cats would be fine, but the dog I’m worried about).

My brother assures me the dog will be fine (he says he does it all the time), & also that the rats remain gone.

Reddit, my brother has done a lot for me when I was younger, especially financially. We are NOT rich so it meant a lot and was a sacrifice. However, I told him I don’t really want to housesit for the reasons above (commute + fear of rats). I've already done it a few times and I'm over it.

We’re not as close as that gesture might make it seem, mainly because he moved states several years ago and we hardly saw each other, but he recently move back to our rural hometown – about 1.5 hours from my tiny house in the city, and we're starting to get closer again. 

About six months ago I had a fully remote job. My brother asked me to house sit his dog and two cats while he went away for 2 weeks (the animals can’t stay with me because my housemate is allergic). I agreed and it was horrible – he had a rat infestation (apparently my brother didn’t know, somehow) and I had to beg another friend to let me stay with them while the exterminator did his thing. I was terrified of the rats so I couldn’t stay put. Not to mention the dog particularly was a lot of work, we went for 4 walks a day and the dog's not very friendly so I need to keep a watchful eye. 

About three months ago, it was a similar situation, where my brother asked me to house sit for one week and I agreed again. My brother assured me the rats were gone, and indeed they were (although I was paranoid and thought I could hear them in the walls), and otherwise there was no incident.

Now my brother is going away for two weeks and wants me to house sit again. Here’s the thing though: I have a new job that is in person 4-days a week (no longer a remote job like last time), and staying at his house would mean a daily 2.5 hour commute (roundtrip), plus the animals would be alone for 8 hours at a time (the cats would be fine, but the dog I’m worried about).

My brother assures me the dog will be fine (he says he does it all the time), & also that the rats remain gone.

Reddit, my brother has done a lot for me when I was younger, especially financially. We are NOT rich so it meant a lot and was a sacrifice. However, I told him I don’t really want to housesit for the reasons above (commute + fear of rats). I've already done it a few times and I'm over it. AITA?",0.0,0.051047396,0,1
17,1ct0vtb,AITA for getting takeout with my friend’s girlfriend ,"I’m 29M, my friend is 25M, and his gf is 22F. 

They’ve been having relationship issues for a while and I’ve somehow became the mediator for their problems through both of them constantly bringing up their problems with me. My friend has OCD, so this triggers a lot of arguments they have. It gets exhausting to deal with, but he’s slowly making progress so I continue to support them when they need to talk. Just to be clear, I’ve told them multiple times I’m just giving my opinion and I’m not a substitute for relationship therapy. I also told them multiple times I think they should not date and are extremely incompatible, but if they’re both willing to work on their issues then I’ll support them where I can. So today it seems I was the cause of triggering his OCD, or maybe I was just being an asshole. You guys tell me:

His gf and I became “close” in the sense that we’re friends because I give her my 3rd person perspective on their problems and she can vent to me about it. I really don’t have any intention with her and she’s never done anything inappropriate to make me think her intentions aren’t platonic either. I’m not attracted to her anyway and I’m not the kind of guy to go after any friend’s gf. 

Anyway it was nice out today so we tried inviting my friend outside to toss a football around. He said he was busy with work so me and her decided to go do that, and she invited one of her girlfriends. Her friend left and we were hungry so we got takeout and went home, separately obviously. We didn’t tell my friend because we didn’t really think it was necessary to get his permission.

My friend called me and asked what I was up to and I told him what I did with my day. He told me to fuck off and said I went behind his back and crossed a boundary he thought I would have never crossed. Before blocking both me and his gf, he insinuated that I was being sketchy with her and my intentions were bad. He was mad that I didn’t tell him I did that stuff with her. I didn’t really get to say much to him so I guess that’s that?

Like me and my friend are/were extremely close. We’ve known each other for the better part of a decade and have cried in each others arms before. He’s had his ocd moments with me before but nothing like this and it’s always been manageable. He should know me better than that. He should trust his best friend and his gf. He knows what we talk about and I never hide anything from him. He’s trusted me this far with his relationship issues, I don’t understand why this is suddenly a “crossed boundary”.

19,1ct0r2e,AITA for leaving my friend behind on a hiking trip?,"I just got back from a hiking trip with a group of friends. We’ve been planning this trip for months, and it was supposed to be a challenging but rewarding trek through some truly beautiful terrain in the Italian Dolomites. One of the newer additions to our friend group, Jake (fake name ofc), insisted on joining us even though he’s not particularly fit or nearly as experienced as the rest of us. We did tell him this, and emphasized how much we wanted to see **all** of the famous viewpoints along the route of the hike.

From the start, Jake was struggling. He was slow, constantly needed breaks, and was clearly having a hard time with the pace and the terrain. We tried to encourage him and adjusted our pace a bit, but it became clear that at his pace, we wouldn’t be able to do our intended route and make it to our planned campsite before dark. There was, however, another pretty easy but definitivelt boring route we could've taken to make it to camp well before nightfall.

After a group discussion, we decided it was best to send Jake down the easy road alone, and then all meet up back at camp once the rest of us had finished our planned adventure. We left Jake with plenty of supplies and a map with clear instructions on how to reach the campsite at his own pace. Jake seemed a little unhappy when we told him the plan, but agreed anyway.

When we finally regrouped that night, Jake was furious. He accused us of abandoning him and putting him in danger. He said he felt humiliated and that we should have all stuck together, no matter what.

The friend group is now pretty divided about what happened. Some of us (myself included) think we made the right call for the enjoyment of the group, while others have agreed with Jake in hindsight, and think we should have stayed together.

20,1ct0p30,"AITA, Basement Blues and Ques","A few months ago, my husband and I decided to remodel our basement. We discussed what we wanted and then decided to select a contractor to complete the job. Although we both made this decision, I was the main contact identifying and meeting with contractors. This involved meeting them before, during, and after work. I also managed the quotes and managed the details. My husband was hands off in the process. When I found one contractor to move forward with our project, my husband did not offer any specifics or terms when we met to finalize our plans. To get ready for the work, we decided to move our existing furniture and storage into a pod.  My husband did not help. When the contracting work began, again, I was the main contact checking on plans, issuing checks, reviewing suggestions, and enforcing our requirements. The work was completed and it looked fantastic. Due to our budget, we were only able to finish half the basement so one half is finished, while the other half is unfinished. When we moved our old furniture and storage back into the basement, this stuff was moved to the unfinished side. After begging my husband to move the furniture back out of the pod, he didn’t do it. We had relatives in town over a holiday and I had them help to clear out the pod. Once everything was on the unfinished side, everything was pretty unorganized and chaotic. Again, I asked for help to clear out the unfinished side and he didn’t help. I got up early before work over multiple days to organize and clear out the space. About two months ago, my husband brought a baseball tee and soft toss balls to toss to our kids in the basement on the unfinished side. He decided our teenagers could practice their baseball swings on the unfinished side. I am furious. After listening to these soft toss balls hit on the unfinished walls and doors, I can’t stand it anymore.

The least he can do is put up nets and I will compromise with the nets but I can’t accept them hitting balls in that area. He said I was being unreasonable but if I wanted the nets that I could put them up. I told him I would not and if he can’t protect that area, he can find another place to practice with the kids. AITA? We have a full backyard and a membership at a local hitting facility. I am mentally drained and have thoughts about how he must value what I do very little. I have other examples like this where he has taken my efforts for granted and then proceed to trample on things he has had no sweat equity in. He doesn’t clean, he doesn’t wash clothes or fold clothes. He doesn’t clean anything in the house or our yard. Is this my que to leave?

I (F28) and my partner (M26) of 3.5 years are planning to attend his best friend’s wedding in a month. My partner is the officiant.  We have been aware of this wedding for almost 1.5 years and will be having to travel about 16 hours by car with our two dogs in order to attend. We have some family that we will be visiting after the wedding and they will be watching our dogs while we attend the wedding. 

My partner has a really difficult time with procrastination and not taking care of “important” (his words) tasks. This has been a struggle for him, and previously I used to pick up a lot of his slack which led to some conflict in our relationship. I have since set some boundaries with myself (thanks to therapy) around not doing certain things for him and have backed off pretty much completely on jumping in to help. Some of these things included reminding him about bills, scheduling appointments, events, etc. 

One of our dogs has extreme anxiety and is a high energy breed. I say this is “our” dog because of our long term relationship but technically this is my partner’s dog and the other is mine. We individually had them before our relationship. So, they are our own separate responsibilities (like handling vet appts, cost, etc separately). His dog can not be in a car AT ALL without extreme whining, barking, etc. He has also tried to crawl in the front seat with us before which definitely feels like a safety concern because he is 60+ lbs. Our previous vet prescribed us meds to help keep him calm during trips, vet appts, and other situational things. 

We moved within the past few months and have not established a vet for our dogs yet. We are out of his meds and have been for 4 months. I have broken my own boundaries by reminding him multiple times over the past 2months to schedule a vet appt so we can get the prescription refilled.

We live with her so since my mom works all the time I’m pretty much the only one who’s home with my grandma all day. I do online school so I make my own schedule. Lately my mom has not been doing anything to help around the house or with my grandma and it’s exhausting because I’m trying to finish my last year of high school and doing everything. I feel very neglected because my mom comes home and barely talks to me. She only talks to me to yell at me about my grades.( I’m an all a student). I just want some help taking care of my grandma and stuff around the house. I also just want my mom back. AITA for asking her to stay home and help me with things?,0.0,-0.0015610505,0,1
26,1ct0fuf,WIBTA for telling my coworkers I have a disease I don't ,"I am a 26 year old Trans man. I have been on hormones for 4 years and have top Surgery scheduled for August (Yay!) the thing is I'm completely stealth at my new job. I started this year and to them I am just a flamboyant cis dude. 

I took a week off and mentioned it was for Surgery because I won't be able to lift anything heavy for a while after and needed to let my boss know, now it's gotten around that I'm having surgery (Annoying but I'll live) the issue is people keep asking if I'm okay and want to know what surgery im getting. 

I've said it's a shoulder thing and I'm fine but there is this one coworker that just won't drop it. She did the same thing when my mum was sick, I think she just really likes drama. I've said I'm not comfortable talking about it and honestly have half a mind to report her but I kind of want to mess with her.

So would I be an asshole if I told her it's like a benign tumor or something? Or like a genetic heart/lung issue. I know if I keep telling her to drop it I'll eventually get annoyed enough to snap at her and that will reflect poorly on me, and I feel like taking it to management or HR will just create a poor environment because she'll get stroppy. I'll tell someone for sure but honestly I want to take her down a peg so I think I would be TAH because really it's just a desire for petty revenge ",Everyone Sucks POO Mode,2024-05-16,"WIBTA for telling my coworkers I have a disease I don't  I am a 26 year old Trans man.

27,1ct0ezh,AITA for saying my friend wasn’t alone while her cat passed?,"A few days ago my friend called my work with an emergency with her very elderly cat. Her mom was out of town and she doesn’t drive or have anyone else in the area. I left work (getting an attendance point because I didn’t have PTO but frankly that wasn’t my concern) and rushed over to her so I could take her and the cat to the emergency vet. My friend is quite a bit younger than I am and just didn’t have as much experience as well as being really stressed so I called her mom to explain what was going on, explained everything to the vet, communicated what the vet said to her mom and ultimately made the decision to let the cat go. We sat with her while she passed and I held my friend until she said she was ready to go. 


I was over at their house once the mom came home and she said she was so sorry the daughter was “all alone” dealing with all of this. I said simply “I tried to make sure she wasn’t all alone- jay, or the kitty- but I’m so sorry that it all went down the way it did and if there is anything else I can do please let me know” 


A family friend at the table jumped in and said that if she felt alone she was alone and that’s what matters. I said I absolutely was not trying to disregard how she felt and I i absolutely shouldn’t have mentioned anything about how I was feeling. I apologized and we moved on with the service. 

Later the family friend walked up to me and told me she was disappointed that I tried to make it all about me and I should be ashamed. She said all I did was “drive the car and hold her hand” which “doesn’t matter.” I didn’t mention the money or anything else because frankly that doesn’t matter. 

I felt taken aback but once again apologized for anything I said that came across wrong as it wasn’t my intention however I understand it was out of line and genuinely apologize. This person huffed and told me that “kids your age know nothing” before stalking away. 

I ended up giving my friend a hug with the keepsake I made from a picture I took and the footprint they gave us and told her if she needed anything to text me day or night. She told me thank you, that she appreciated me, I was her only real friend and I left. 

I went home and found the family friend I talked to made a Facebook post for the memorial mentioning how my friend was “suffering alone” with “no support around” but managed to “pull through in the most difficult time of her life and do what she needed”.

28,1ct0cl2,AITA for not fixing the TV?,"This happened a few minutes ago.
I had a really stressful day and i was resting for a bit.
I was on the TV room using my phone and i heard my dad coming in:

- Hey, hows going?
+ Not much, theres a soccer match going on and im gonna watch it

As soon as he turns on the TV he presses the button for voice commands and dictates the channel to the TV, TV says “this is not possible right now”, he does it again and the TV responds the same way.
At this point i look at him and ask:

- Did you try using the buttons?
+ They are not working, the remote is not working 
(I’ve been looking at him and he didn’t try using the buttons)

At this point i grab the remote and i tell him:

- Let me try to fix it

I try the change channel button, the TV says not possible, volume? Not possible, i touch the home button and it works, change the device and go back to the cable, check again? Doesn’t work…
Through this whole process he is just staring at me like im a tech support guy and yelling because i cant fix the TV.
I just stood up, gave him the remote and say:

- If you are gonna act like that, do it yourself

I leave the room and next thing i know is that he is still yelling about idk what, he goes down and turns on the other TV while he keeps yelling at me because i didn’t fix the problem, so i calmly said:

- You started yelling at me
+ Yeah but i asked you to fix the TV and you didn’t 
(I tried to fix it myself with out him asking me to)
- Yeah, and you started yelling at me
+ Shut up, dumbass

At this point im really upset, its the first time he calls me a dumbass and it was just because i couldn’t fix the TV, then my mom comes in my room and tells me i was wrong for not fixing the TV, so, AITA?

TDLR; I tried to fix the TV and left because he started yelling at me, he called me dumbass because of it and also my mom told me i was wrong for not fixing it.

Well, recently, (November 9th, 2023)... my stepdad had an episode of rage. He had flipped out on me over a tool he couldn't find. He only got angrier when i said i dont know..

31,1ct041c,AITA for telling my mom that she isn't a mom to me?,"I just got into an argument with my mom over my cousins and told her I didn't consider her a mom anymore.. We got into an argument because a couple years ago we all had a falling out about certain incidents that had happened between all of us, and we were way younger. For context, in 2016 my grandma died, and we moved in with my cousins and my aunt and my uncle. My uncles first daughter is from another marriage he had a couple years back and she lived most of the time with her mom. Her step dads son had inappropiatly touched her multiple times.And told her that “this is how you show someone that you love them”. She loved her siblings so using that she committed the same acts against them with the same reasoning, and when we moved in, they continued that with us. The oldest daughter (K) was 12. Me (A) and her younger brother(I), were around the age of 10. My cousin's younger sister(M) was 9 and my younger brother (IL) was 7. Therefore, we had no idea what exactly we were doing when this all was going on. A bunch of fighting happened and we moved out and no one knew of the incidents except for us kids. Eventually we all got back and started talking again in 2019 and they moved in with us because they had been homeless for a while. After they moved in, a bunch of arguments were happening and it got to my parents that something had happened years ago. I didn’t exactly explain in depth what happened. All my parents know was that some kind of activity went on that was very inappropriate. We all lost contact with each other because of multiple reasons. Recently I (now 17) got back in contact with my older cousin(K), and she had told me how a lot of things have changed, and I should try and hear them out. And what she had said was true. My uncle and my cousin were both in therapy, getting the help they needed. And nothing else inappropriate was going on and I had known that we had all grown from the situation because we were just kids and we were all now over the age of 12. And we understood what we did was wrong and we wouldn't do it ever again. I've been in contact with them for about a year now and my mom does not agree with me. She tries to put her opinion in and we get into arguments a lot about it all the time. My mom recently brought up that I apparently support them when I know that there's still stuff going on down there, but she refuses to talk to my aunt or my uncle or try and get the details of what actually happened. I told her that she needs to let it go and that she's holding on to it because she doesn't like my uncle and my aunt for multiple reasons as they've had arguments.

33,1ct02ty,AITA for making a sandwich instead of eating the dinner my stepfather made?,"I (15f) am plus sized. It runs in our family as well as diabetes. I got bullied in school relentlessly to the point I am now homeschooled, having panic attacks if I even pass by the school. The memories are too much for me. Due to the bullying I have a rocky relationship with food, I don’t eat anything other than dinner (because I’m forced to), and I won’t eat at a friends house or in public period.

Tonight I decided that I didn’t want to eat the dinner that was prepared by my stepdad (54m) as it was just too much for me and I knew I wouldn’t eat most of it. (I didn’t want to go another night getting yelled at for not eating all my food that he plated for me.) Instead I made a sandwich, something I was more comfortable eating than the pork, peas, and pasta salad. I planned on cutting the sandwich in half and saving the other half for something else. When I finished preparing it I was about to grab a knife to cut it. 

A little background on my stepdad, he’s a recovering alcoholic and has been emotionally and mentally abusive towards me since he started dating my mom (50f). My mother is a narcissist. So, whenever I’m doing something in the kitchen with food (due to the times he’s harassed me for “eating too much” when I haven’t even put anything more than a small scoop of mashed potato’s on a plate) I freeze if I hear footsteps. 

He walked in and looked me up and down from where I was frozen in place, he looked disgusted. “You don’t think that’s a little much?” He eyed the sandwich I had made (two slices of ham, cheese, and salami).

“Maybe…) I was scared so I muttered it, he got angrier.

“Why did you make this? I made dinner!” He was red in the face, he looked like he was trying not to yell at me.

“I didn’t want it…” I didn’t look at him in the eyes, I was shaking, afraid.

“I want you to take half of that off and put it away, you don’t need to eat all of that, it’s a waste of good food!” Then he stormed out, going upstairs to complain to my mother (who works from home) about how horrible and ungrateful I am or whatever. 

This put me off eating at all so I bagged the sandwich and put it in the fridge then went to my room. Now I’m starting to think I should have just eaten what he made because I feel like I hurt his feelings. Am I the asshole?",No A-holes here,2024-05-16,"AITA for making a sandwich instead of eating the dinner my stepfather made? I (15f) am plus sized. It runs in our family as well as diabetes. I got bullied in school relentlessly to the point I am now homeschooled, having panic attacks if I even pass by the school. The memories are too much for me. Due to the bullying I have a rocky relationship with food, I don’t eat anything other than dinner (because I’m forced to), and I won’t eat at a friends house or in public period.

Tonight I decided that I didn’t want to eat the dinner that was prepared by my stepdad (54m) as it was just too much for me and I knew I wouldn’t eat most of it. (I didn’t want to go another night getting yelled at for not eating all my food that he plated for me.) Instead I made a sandwich, something I was more comfortable eating than the pork, peas, and pasta salad. I planned on cutting the sandwich in half and saving the other half for something else. When I finished preparing it I was about to grab a knife to cut it. 

A little background on my stepdad, he’s a recovering alcoholic and has been emotionally and mentally abusive towards me since he started dating my mom (50f). My mother is a narcissist. So, whenever I’m doing something in the kitchen with food (due to the times he’s harassed me for “eating too much” when I haven’t even put anything more than a small scoop of mashed potato’s on a plate) I freeze if I hear footsteps. 

He walked in and looked me up and down from where I was frozen in place, he looked disgusted. “You don’t think that’s a little much?” He eyed the sandwich I had made (two slices of ham, cheese, and salami).

“Maybe…) I was scared so I muttered it, he got angrier.

“Why did you make this? I made dinner!” He was red in the face, he looked like he was trying not to yell at me.

“I didn’t want it…” I didn’t look at him in the eyes, I was shaking, afraid.

“I want you to take half of that off and put it away, you don’t need to eat all of that, it’s a waste of good food!” Then he stormed out, going upstairs to complain to my mother (who works from home) about how horrible and ungrateful I am or whatever. 

This put me off eating at all so I bagged the sandwich and put it in the fridge then went to my room. Now I’m starting to think I should have just eaten what he made because I feel like I hurt his feelings. Am I the asshole?",4.0,-0.0014526744,0,0

I’ve always loved the name Avery (fake name) and before my husband and I were even married we talked about baby names and I said I loved that name for a kid.

A few years later when his sister was pregnant and we were visiting, she asked us if we’d ever thought of any baby names and we mentioned Avery. My MIL overheard and gasped.

36,1cszy8d,AITA for wanting to be buried with my sister?,"
My 20 year old sister passed away in March of last year. She was buried directly behind our paternal grandfather (and when she passes our grandmother). My paternal aunts will be buried in the plots side by side to their parents. My parents bought the two plots on either side of my sister. 

The plan right now is my dad will be on one side and my mom on the other. My maternal grandmother will be buried with my mom (one casket + two things of ashes can be buried in one grave in our cemetery). 

Our older sister will be buried with little sister.

So basically my parents, both sisters and 3/4 grandparents and two aunts will be buried in the same place. I want to too when the day comes. I’m only 22 but I don’t care if it takes 70 years.

My dad is against adding me directly to my little sister’s stone as of right now, which I agree with. We are finally able to look into grave stones after her funeral costs so we have been discussing it more lately. 

But I said “we can always do it later” and he kept on insisting I can only do it after I get married because my future husband might not want to be buried there and want to share a grave with me in a different plot or cemetery all together. 

I get what he is saying. I do. And I would not make the final decision for a few years at least.  But here’s the thing I’m single right now, and I wouldn’t mind being buried in the plot directly behind my sister(s) grave if my future husband wanted to be buried there as well (which I can purchase it if it want to). But if he doesn’t want to be buried there then I’ll insist to be cremated and some ashes go into the grave my sisters are/ will be one day. And some with my future spouse or for my future children to have. 

My dad will end up being buried with 2 of his children (all 3 if I’m buried there) his wife, parents, MIL and sisters, he also has a brother but I’m not sure about him as he lives in Europe. I want to be buried with my family. My mom’s two sisters are divorced and so are my maternal grandparents. There is always a chance I get divorced or something. If I’m buried with my family I’ll always know I’m with people who love me I am not sure about the future and who I will end up marrying. 

My dad says i shouldn’t do anything until I’m married.

39,1ctrm1k,AITA for backing out on vacation with my best friends ,"My two best friends and I have talked about going on vacation together for quite a while and have now been able to find time where all three of us are available to do so. 

Both of them really wanted a beach holiday, whereas I would have preferred  to do some sightseeing because I’m really not the beach type and I’m already going on vacation with my family this year where going to the beach is involved. Since the two of them obviously outnumber me, I didn’t want to stand in the way of our plans or fight them on this matter (I wouldn’t have convinced them anyway.). 

My friends don’t have the same budget as I do, so when looking at hotels, it had to be on the cheaper side (like we have to pay a daily fee to use the air conditioning in the middle of August type cheap). I would have preferred better and therefore more expensive hotels, but obviously I can’t change their budget, so I was forced to adapt to them. 

I kept quiet, telling myself that I’m fine with everything, but after booking I have realised that I’m not. I know I should have said something earlier but I really didn’t want them to be mad at me and I didn’t want to disappoint them (which if I now decide to back out will happen inevitably), since they were and still are very eager to go.

I know that at the end of the day I could go on this vacation with them, but I’d be uncomfortable most of the time and also I’d be annoyed to have spent a couple hundred bucks for something I’m not thouroughly enjoying, but again, technically I could go. What irks me is that ultimately, I’d be getting the short end of the stick because I had to compromise and they at no point have or would be able to do so (Even on vacation itself my expectations and standards on for example what to do and where to eat will differ from theirs, and I know that I’m at no point going to get what I want which is not their fault but still)

I (20F) have always dreamt of college/university from when I was young, or at least that's what my parents believe. They shaped this dream primarily because I grew up watching all those 90s and 2000s movies that glamorized the college experience, not because I have any genuine passion for higher education or something. My parents, especially my father who never had the chance to go to college when he was my age, have been carefully planning my academic future since before I can remember.

For years, I've overheard my parents boasting to their friends about how ""El is definitely going to college"" and detailing the prestigious programs they were certain I'd enroll in. Here's the kicker: I never expressed any interest in those plans. Heck, I never even confirmed I wanted to go to college at all! I've always been undecided, but instead of being honest, I just smiled and nodded, hoping the conversation would move on. The pressure has been immense, but I've kept my thoughts and feelings hidden, terrified of disappointing them or coming off as some unappreciative daughter.

Now, I'm drowning in my own head. My parents have invested so much time, effort, and money into preparing for my college education. Like I can see the pride in their eyes when they talk about my ""bright future,"" and it breaks my heart. But as of last night, after a deep conversation with friends who are feeling the same pressure, I decided that I need to come clean.

I want to sit my parents down and tell them that I'm not ready for college, that I need more time to figure out what I truly want in life. But there's this voice in my head screaming, ""You're an ungrateful brat!"" Tbh the guilt is eating me alive.

Maybe I'm being silly, but I think a handwritten letter can be more impactful than something printed out or an email.  Additionally, I think writing in this way encourages you to be more thoughtful, as you obviously can't just delete a mistake as easily as you can on a PC.

As such, I've become discouraged that my daughter (12) not only has some of the worst penmanship that I've ever seen, but also sees writing anything out by hand as absolute torture.  She's blatantly of the mindset that there's no reason to bother when everything's done digitally.  Recently, she had to compose an essay for class.  Now the teacher is not requiring students to doing any writing by hand, of course, but I decided that I'd prefer my daughter start putting in some effort on improving her handwriting.  I told her that regardless of what her teacher expected, I wanted her to handwrite out her essay for me.  I also said that I expected it to neat and for her to focus on penmanship rather than speed.

Naturally, my daughter did not like this.  She threw a tantrum, insisted I was abusing her, and cried in her room nonstop for nearly an hour.  When my wife got my home, our daughter told her why she was upset, and my took her side, insisting that if the teacher wasn't requiring it, there was no need for the extra labor.

Now, in my opinion, as her father, I see it as just as much my job to educate her, if not more.  I think it should be fine for me to task my child to improve herself.  But, obviously, she is also my wife's child, and I don't want to be a hypocrite by acting as if my opinion should be more valid than her own.

44,1ctqzbw,AITA for not helping a homeless man I tripped?,"I (22m) was climbing up the stairs from the subway and there was a homeless man stopping and begging/heckling people for money at the top. A lot of them are drug addicts in this particular neighbourhood so I never give them anything.

I tried to keep my distance and ignore him but he still came over and grabbed my arm as I passed. I got slightly angry at this and quickly pulled away, which caused him to trip and fall on the concrete. I noticed he had a walking cane then, and was probably disabled, but I just kept walking. He went on screaming and screaming as I continued down the street. At a distance I looked back and nobody was helping him either. He was laying on his stomach just screaming, possibly hurt or injured. I still left. 

I feel awful about it. I told my brother and he said that he shouldn’t have grabbed my arm in the first place, and that he probably wasn’t hurt but acting, which was likely true from what I’ve seen elsewhere in that area. AITA?

They had me, their only kid, but never got married because they always had ups and downs. They were careful not to fight in front of me, but I knew they were constantly mad at each other. When I was 6, I remember that my dad started sleeping in another room, and ever since, my parents barely spoke to each other even when they were in the same room. I was little, but I knew something was off. Then, when I was 9, my dad told me he was going to start sleeping in another house.

Then my mom started telling me that my dad abandoned us and that I should be angry at him. When I told my dad, she never said that to me again. I guess they agreed not to put me between their mess. Later, I found out that when my dad changed rooms when I was 6, they had broken up and remained so for almost three years. My dad explained to me that the relationship was bad for both of them, so he decided to end it without a chance of reconciliation.

Then stared at me as I stared at them. I said okay. She felt bad bc I'd befriended her. Taken her holiday gifts, fresh flowers when I got mine, baked for her. All out of gratitude that she got him off me.
Weeks go by and nothing really changed for me. Doing the same with my husband tho he suspected I was secretly mad. I assured him I wasn't. He initiated intimacy again and it's been exhausting I was spoiled for two years getting out of it. I invited her to our therapy (his idea) and told them flat out we had a good thing going & can we go back to it? After I told them I always knew I said I would even pay her. She said she wasn't a whore & I asked her why she thought I got her gifts, etc. Now she says I'm the ahole and my husband just cried.",1.0,1.0373464822769165,1,1
52,1ctqfxg,AITA for Leaving My Friend's Apartment Unannounced After a Month of Awkward Co-Living?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Here's some backstory: This woman took my virginity in 2014. She was homeless, living in her car, and we worked at the same job. We became close, and planned to get an apartment together, but she had to handle something personal with her mother in another state and drove off. We said goodbye and lost contact for six years. During that time, she joined the Navy and finished her service.

In 2020, I had some savings and decided to reach out to her. To my surprise, she still had the same number. I asked how she was and if she still wanted to get a place together. She invited me to live with her in Florida, rent-free if I paid for food. I said I'd prefer paying a fixed amount, she said no just buy food. Fine, I flew down there. I thought we're finally gonna be the couple I dreamed of.

When I arrived, I found out she had two cats, which were against the apartment rules, but I didn't complain since I wasn't paying rent. She was also involved with a guy she met in the Navy, who she continued to see. Her birthday came, and she got dolled up to meet him, leaving me alone with the cats

One day she suggested we move to a nicer place together. The pictures looked great. Two bed, one bath. However, she wanted one room for herself, one for the cats as a playroom, and me to sleep on the couch. That was funny. Yeah I'm not gonna work my ass off and co-sign a new place with you so your cats can live better than me. I couldn't tell if she was joking because I saw how much she loved those cats.

We're sitting there and I just tell her I'm gonna start dating. She got quiet and it was awkward for a minute but she said fine okay, before adding that she wasn't exclusive with the Navy guy. Like I'm supposed to be cool with me and him both being intimate with you. Since I got here she hasn't shown a sign of us being being anything but friends. You have your guy, I'm gonna meet someone too. I immediately started using Tinder and met new people within days, which seemed to bother her. She began locking me out if I wasn't back by a certain time and nitpicking over small things she didn't before.

The final straw came when I arrived home early from work and found myself locked out because she wouldn't share the keypad code. She's usually home before me so she'd let me in. I dropped my things and sat with my back against the door for hours. Random people in other rooms going about their business would ask if I was okay, I'd just say my roommate won't let me in. A random couple even went to 7-11 to buy me Gatorade. She came home, asked me why I didn't do something else to kill time other than make her look bad. I said I didn't feel like going anywhere. She was just angry and sour towards me.

I decided to leave without telling her. I booked a flight, stayed one night in a hotel, and flew home the next day. I blocked her number, and though she tried to call twice, I haven't looked back. This all happened within 30 days.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-16,"AITA for Leaving My Friend's Apartment Unannounced After a Month of Awkward Co-Living? Throwaway for obvious reasons.

53,1ctqb5x,AITA for not coming to a student government lunch when I didn’t have to?,"As a Student government member, I have helped collaborate with other members to start a “field-day” event. I try my best to make it to every meeting, event, etc. that comes up. I’m well respected by our sponsor/teacher that runs Student Government (I’ll call her Ms. P). I don’t mean that in a selfish way, and hope it doesn’t come across like that. The way we have planned our event is that Student Government Members all help out a bit.
Now, field day falls during teacher appreciation week, and SGA planned to deliver gift bags to classrooms. I was uninformed by other members that field day was the day of gift bag delivery. Literally no one. Not Ms. P, not any SGA members, no emails, no nothing. So I go on throughout the day, until lunch, when two government members ask our teacher to go to lunch with SGA and Ms. P. I ask the two members if I have to go to the lunch, and they reply both with no. Lunch goes by, and 6th pd rolls around. This is when field day was almost about to start. I go to Ms. P’s room, and get ready to go to my station. She hits me with “No, you can’t help because you were too lazy to help with teacher gifts earlier.” I was confused. I was actually looking forward to helping. Wondering what she was talking about, I explained the situation. Ms. P shrugged in reply, and said something like, “Oh well”. She said I should have showed up regardless. I didn’t want to argue though, and I don’t want to be petty and be like, “Well they said! Blah blah blah”, so I just went along with Ms P. She definitely acted like I was in the wrong. Im guessing the lunch was to do some last minute prep or something like that. Am I in the wrong here? I can see how Ms P thinks I should have showed up to the lunch, and I will admit, looking back on it, it’s not my best choice, but again, I was told it was optional, and I wasn’t even told in the first place about the gift bags. From her point of view it may have seemed like I slacked off, but after I explained the situation, her reaction was still the same. AITA?

55,1ctpz8c,AITA for exploding on my husband over childcare," I 20F have a 7 month old baby with my 23M husband. Ever since my son was born I do 95% of the childcare on top of household things. I don’t usually mind doing it because I like everything done a certain way and if I leave it to my husband it will end up a mess. He has a physically demanding job and works from 3pm-2:00am. The past month he’s decided to get into shape. He runs for an hour every day and then regular workouts. 3 times a week he goes to boxing classes and runs for an hour by the time he gets home it’s already 1-1:30. Then he cooks his food separate because he’s on a diet. By the time he’s done with everything it’s already time for him to go to work. 
  Recently we’re arguing more because I’m feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. My baby doesn’t want to be held by anyone else but me and wants to be in my arms 24/7. He’s a big baby and holding him all day is hard but I have no options he hates baby carriers now. I’ve also felt myself becoming more depressed and some days I don’t even want to get out of bed. My husband has the mindset that i should do all the household chores because it’s my duty. I’ve tried to talk to him about me needing him to stay home and help me a little more and by help I just mean watching our baby while I sleep or playing with him. I know he’s tired when he gets home and he gets stressed. 
  Yesterday I finally exploded and started screaming and crying about how I don’t feel appreciated for everything I do and how mentally exhausting it is to stay home with a Velcro baby all day. He said how stressed out he is with people at his job, his mom, and sometimes he just needs to relax. We’re ignoring each other right now but the more I think about it I feel guilty. I know he doesn’t respond well when I’m screaming at him and it makes him anxious. On the other hand I also feel that I’ve tried talking to him enough and I shouldn’t have to beg him to help me.

Edit: everyone who keeps mentioning my cleaning habits I have OCD I’m getting treatment for it but it’s a process I’m showing improvements I hope I’ll get better soon. I also think I should add I have a connective tissue disorder that affects the joints in my body. I’m physically in pain every day.

58,1ctpglb,AITA for not inviting my friend to celebrate with us?,"This is a long post but i really need some inputs on this one...  
I am currently living with two of my friends, M and K (all of us M23). Me and M have been living together for 3 years and are (or at least we used to be) close friends. K was M's friend and he moved in about a year ago. K and M where pretty good friends until K moved in, but they started to annoy each other soon after K moved in with us. They both complained about each other to me, and I felt like I was kind of in the middle, not knowing what to do.

Fast forward to the present, the bad mood lies like a fog in our apartment. M spends most his time at his GF's place and when he is home he's always in his room. It went from us doing everything together (working out, drinking, playing poker, cooking, studying) to me only seeing him for a minute a day when he's on his way to the bathroom and has to go through the living room. 

This has resulted in me spending more time with K. Me and K both like to watch TV and movies in the living room and we both work out (M stopped when he got a GF),  so we hang out pretty often. M has told me that he does not like that I hang out with K because he is a negative person by nature and that can be a little exhausting to be around. Also, K was a little rude to M's GF one time (I was told) and this resulted in her not wanting to be in our apartment. I'm a social and positive dude so I don't mind K being like he is, i just want someone to do stuff with. I've tried to explain this to M but he says he can't stand K anymore and would rather be in his room than in the living room with him. This has been going on for about 10 months and during this time me and M have gone from hanging every day to barely speaking to each other, while me and K have become better friends.

Tomorrow is our country's national day and it's a BIG celebration. It's one of the best days of the year and we  basically party and drink all day. This is where my problems start: K is going to celebrate with some of his friends and i asked if i could join them because I don't have that many friends here and I wanted to make the most out of the day. This was OK and I was invited to both the breakfast and the table they had booked on a restaurant down town to continue the celebration. I had heard nothing from M (as usual) so i just assumed that he was spending the day with his GF. I sent him a text and asked him what he was doing tomorrow and he responded that he was going to stay at home because we had not invited him to celebrate with us (for clarification: in my country this is like saying you are going to spend Christmas eve or new years eve alone). I asked him if he wanted to join but he told me the invite came too late and that he was staying in. **AITA** for not asking him sooner? We used to be really close but have drifted apart these last months, and I'm very conflicted between feeling bad for not inviting him and not caring because I had to invite myself and he does not even like K but still expects to be invited to the celebration with K's friends.

K is not a person I'm going to stay in touch with after college, but as I mentioned I am a social person that likes to be around people. I would much rather sit with K in the living room talking than lock myself in my room and not speaking to anyone (like M is doing). Ever since I became friends with M i thought i had made a friend I would stay in touch with after my studies was done, but now I'm not so sure anymore. We never had an argument during the 3 years we have known each other but I can tell that he felt like I betrayed him by celebrating with K and his fiends...",TL;DR,2024-05-16,"AITA for not inviting my friend to celebrate with us?

I'm a social and positive dude so I don't mind K being like he is, i just want someone to do stuff with. I've tried to explain this to M but he says he can't stand K anymore and would rather be in his room than in the living room with him. This has been going on for about 10 months and during this time me and M have gone from hanging every day to barely speaking to each other, while me and K have become better friends.

Tomorrow is our country's national day and it's a BIG celebration. It's one of the best days of the year and we  basically party and drink all day. This is where my problems start: K is going to celebrate with some of his friends and i asked if i could join them because I don't have that many friends here and I wanted to make the most out of the day. This was OK and I was invited to both the breakfast and the table they had booked on a restaurant down town to continue the celebration. I had heard nothing from M (as usual) so i just assumed that he was spending the day with his GF. I sent him a text and asked him what he was doing tomorrow and he responded that he was going to stay at home because we had not invited him to celebrate with us (for clarification: in my country this is like saying you are going to spend Christmas eve or new years eve alone). I asked him if he wanted to join but he told me the invite came too late and that he was staying in. **AITA** for not asking him sooner? We used to be really close but have drifted apart these last months, and I'm very conflicted between feeling bad for not inviting him and not caring because I had to invite myself and he does not even like K but still expects to be invited to the celebration with K's friends.

K is not a person I'm going to stay in touch with after college, but as I mentioned I am a social person that likes to be around people. I would much rather sit with K in the living room talking than lock myself in my room and not speaking to anyone (like M is doing). Ever since I became friends with M i thought i had made a friend I would stay in touch with after my studies was done, but now I'm not so sure anymore. We never had an argument during the 3 years we have known each other but I can tell that he felt like I betrayed him by celebrating with K and his fiends...",,0.12993678450584412,0,0

I, 21F, and my sister, 22F, had a friend who I’ll call ‘H’. H had recently gotten a new guy to ‘speak’ to at the time that neither of us liked due to how he treated her. During a night of gaming, he started spouting off at the mouth and being disrespectful by calling us ‘trashy players’ and that he was better then we are. We both were over level 100, while she and him were under lvl 50. I went off on him for the disrespect and so did my sister, while H didn’t say anything.
   I understand the fear of confrontation that H has as I have the same thing. However, H called me an my sister family and, did not defend us or tell him to stop, but allowed his toxic behavior to continue. After the match my sister and I got off for the night as that had completely ruined the mood. Come morning, H texts us in a group asking to talk about what happened. We spoke for a while about it and explained our POVs. After a while it did become charged as my sister and I expected it would.
   She claimed we were battling with her about it and that she was upest. However, when we told her we were not going after her over his actions, H then ghosted the chat. A few hours later, H came back and said she believed in the “confront in private” aspect of relationships. To add context, the two hadn’t been dating more than a week, and we had just met him that night. H said that he apologized to her, and my sister pointed out that it didn’t really matter if he apologized to her about it, but that it mattered if he apologized to me as he came after me the most.
    The conversation ended there as H said she was done with the conversation after I pointed out how she said we were her sisters too yet allowed this behavior. I then removed and blocked her on everything, with proof. She has since manipulated the story to make us seem like the bad guys.

So I (26f) am not a person who likes conflicts, if my snack comes wrong I will probably tell you that it came wrong but I will eat it anyway and still be grateful, I have improved about this over the years, but I still hate creating conflicts.

Yet for a few years now I've been feeling fed up with nosy people or people who like to make nasty comments about people, so in a passive aggressive way I often rebut a comment in a way that can make them feel embarrassed. I will give some examples:

One time a friend of a friend saw my leg tattoo and made a joke about how ridiculous it was and what a tattoo it must have meant (I have a cat with glasses on my leg), I turned to him pretending to cry and said I got this tattoo with a friend of mine who unfortunately passed away, that was her cat (a lie, I got that tattoo in a flash), he apologized and walked away.

62,1ctotyw,AITA for not going to Easter dinner?,"My (29F) uncle “Steven” was horrible to me growing up. He would bully me as well as keep picking at me and saying a bunch of stuff until I had enough and got mad. But then the second I did, he’d play the victim and I got in trouble.
When I was 18, shit hit the fan when he continued to bully me and I stood up for myself once and for all. I said I didn’t care if my dad (this is his brother) still saw him but I wasn’t going to. And I would not go to any events where he was, unless they were big ones (weddings, funerals, etc.) At this point, there was a divide in my family. A lot of people finally realized what an asshole he was and chose to stop putting up with it. There were a few that stuck by Steven’s side but they were outliers. My dad, to his credit, did distance himself from Steven. He’d still see him and talk to him, but their dynamic changed.


Last year, Steven was in a bad accident. He was hospitalized for a few months. In that time, he and my dad got closer. One of my aunts spoke with Steven a bit and confirmed he’s still the same asshole he was before, if not more so. He has no guilt whatsoever for how he treated anyone and feels that everyone is wrong for not rallying to his side when he “almost died”. My dad truly is one of the only ones that have come back around. I don’t need Steven’s apology nor for him to change. But given he’s not, I still don’t want to see him.


I had a feeling for a really long time that my dad reconciling with him would lead to him wanting to bring him around more. And I was right. When Steven was released from the hospital, my dad brought him to his and my mom’s house more. My mom would tell me when he was over and I just wouldn’t come. My dad didn’t push the issue until Easter. He told me he invited Steven. I said “Okay, I’ll come over another night”. My dad said “C’mon, don’t be this way”. I said I’m not being any certain way. I would never tell him not to have Steven over. I’m just not coming. He tried to beg me to reconsider. I asked if Steven had any plans on apologizing or if he at least changed my behavior. My dad admitted no, he’s still the same as always. I said, cool. We can have an Easter celebration another night.


I guess my dad thought I’d change my mind, but when I didn’t show, he called me to ask where I was. I said I was having dinner with some friends. He asked when I’d come over. I said my mom had invited me to come over another night this week. My dad asked “Seriously? You’re not coming?” I asked if Steven was there, he said yes. I said “I’ll see you Tuesday! Enjoy your Easter.”


It’s been over a month at this point and things have not changed with me and my dad. We haven’t had any major blowouts or anything. But he has made it clear he feels he has to choose between me and Steven. I said I’d never expect him to. But then, I get to make choices too. When he tried complaining to other family, most said I was right but some told him I was immature. So, AITA?

We’ve now found out that she left him to go back to her junkie ex. 

I never wanted children of my own and was happy being a step mom to her despite the issues we have had over the years because of her mental health and her bio mom being toxic and causing her to have massive dips in her mental health where she’s attempted to take her life.

We have talked about it and have agreed that we will leave everything to our grandson save for some of my jewellery which I will be leaving to my sister as it was my Nan’s which I had recast. The reason we want to leave everything to him is because of my stepdaughters attitude towards money and personal belongings.

65,1ctodyo,AITA for ruining a funeral and potentially costing a lot of family members their jobs?,"My grandparents passed away recently. I followed the guidelines my grandma set up for her final event. Her Church, her burial plot, her casket and the same for my grandpa. I just didn't expect for it to be a joint funeral. I sent out the notifications to friends of theirs and family after the date was set in stone. Their friends all came, so did most of my grandma's church but no family showed up. I wasn't surprised, I hadn't seen most of them in about 4 years.

I had a great time with my grandparents friends and then I went back home and cried my heart out. I had been their sole caregiver and I didn't know what to do without them. I had taken care of them for 15 years. It started with little things like lifting heavy things and escalated to needing to change the bed twice a night sometimes. I was empty and started to scroll through my grandpa's facebook to see pictures he posted before his memory went..

I found a group, started about 3 years ago that was being flooded with activity. When I went poking around I found out it was my mother who was hosting a funeral at her church and was 'trying to get final expenses taken care of.' I was stunned. Here was the woman I hadn't spoken to since throwing her out of the house for stealing jewelry and upsetting grandma terribly by using her Alzheimer's against her. 'How could you forget my birthday! You promised to give me this!' 

I went to the funeral my mother had planned and listened to the pastor and then my mother got up to talk. She told everyone how hard it was taking care of them and something inside me roared to life. I don't remember everything I said, but it did include that she didn't pay for anything for them, not their caskets, not their burial plots, not their cremation, nothing. I told everyone I put them to rest at the funeral grandma planned herself 4 days prior. I said she'd never paid for any of their care or even seen them for 4 years.

I was asked to leave and drove home. Later, a cousin asked me if what I said was true and when I said it was and I could provide proof, they explained my mother had been taking funds from the family for years to pay for their care at a facility because they had outlived their insurance policy. They also explained I got a lot of people in trouble because somewhere in the speech I shouted I had done it all alone for years without any help. A lot of family members used my grandparents as an excuse to get out of work and had invited their coworkers to the funeral. By hearing my outburst they were now in trouble for lying as for the reasons to leave work or miss days.

She then went on to ask me about the inheritance and when that would be passed out. I told her that if anyone had earned the inheritance it had already been taken care of. I thought I was in the right, but now I'm doubting myself after so many cousins and family members are calling to tell me I handled it really poorly.

When I went poking around I found out it was my mother who was hosting a funeral at her church and was 'trying to get final expenses taken care of.' I was stunned. Here was the woman I hadn't spoken to since throwing her out of the house for stealing jewelry and upsetting grandma terribly by using her Alzheimer's against her. 'How could you forget my birthday! You promised to give me this!' 

I went to the funeral my mother had planned and listened to the pastor and then my mother got up to talk. She told everyone how hard it was taking care of them and something inside me roared to life. I don't remember everything I said, but it did include that she didn't pay for anything for them, not their caskets, not their burial plots, not their cremation, nothing. I told everyone I put them to rest at the funeral grandma planned herself 4 days prior. I said she'd never paid for any of their care or even seen them for 4 years.

I was asked to leave and drove home. Later, a cousin asked me if what I said was true and when I said it was and I could provide proof, they explained my mother had been taking funds from the family for years to pay for their care at a facility because they had outlived their insurance policy. They also explained I got a lot of people in trouble because somewhere in the speech I shouted I had done it all alone for years without any help. A lot of family members used my grandparents as an excuse to get out of work and had invited their coworkers to the funeral. By hearing my outburst they were now in trouble for lying as for the reasons to leave work or miss days.

She then went on to ask me about the inheritance and when that would be passed out. I told her that if anyone had earned the inheritance it had already been taken care of. I thought I was in the right, but now I'm doubting myself after so many cousins and family members are calling to tell me I handled it really poorly. 

AITA? Did I handle this badly? Everyone's telling me I did. ",0.0,0.02942519634962082,0,1

Today Nick came back to the server and proceeded to get very upset at the mod team for ""Stalking him"" (i do not deny that we kinda did, but we didn't go to his house or hunt him down, we were just concerned) and yelled at us.

67,1ctnrvo,AITA for taking over my roommates half of the rent so she can move out?,"Me and my roommate moved in together in September of last year. I found us the apartment, went on all the tours, met with the landlord, and all she had to do was sign the lease. She and I are on one lease together for one year, so it’s up at the end of August this year. We’ve gotten along well for the most part, we never spent a ton of time together while living together. If I had a problem, I would come to her about it. We both work and don’t have a ton of money. 

A couple months ago she let me know she was planning on breaking the lease agreement and finding someone to take her half of the lease over. I said that was fine but that finding someone would be her responsibility since she was breaking the lease. It’s been a few months and so far she’s brought me one person to tour the place to move in. This person is younger than me and doesn’t have a job. Also my roommate failed to list our place as the correct rent amount on Facebook marketplace. She listed it as $800 when the cost is $825 without utilities included. She was expecting the sub-letter to pay her half of the deposit that she paid when she moved in ($825). 

I recently got a new job that pays a lot more and I didn’t want to stress about finding a new roommate on her short notice. I told her I would just take over the whole lease. She then asked me if I would be paying her the $825 of her deposit back. I said no, I don’t have that money and I’m not moving out anytime soon. She is telling me I’m stealing $1600 from her because she paid rent through May and her half of the deposit. This makes no sense to me since that money goes to our landlord and not me and I won’t be getting a deposit back since I’m not planning to move anytime soon. 

I’m also pregnant and didn’t want to have to share my space with anyone after my baby comes. If I let a roommate move in and sublet and they want to renew the lease, I can’t say no. I wouldn’t have that option anymore. I told my roommate that since she is breaking her lease, she put herself in this situation. She’s so mad at me and I’m just wondering if I really am doing something wrong. My landlord told me I don’t have to pay her but she’s insisting that I’m the one fucking her over when she made the decision to break the lease agreement.

68,1ctnhmi,AITA for being angry at my friends,"Hey hey. It has always been hard for me to tell whether I'm in the right or not. I don't know why. 

Let me start by telling you that I met these guys at a (still ongoing) seminar a few months ago. When we all started to get to know each other we got along pretty well and started to meet after the seminars. 

One day, one of these guys (M) has started telling us about some chat GPT module his sister has told him about. Out of the blue, one of the other guys (H) has asked if she's hot. We have all laughed for hours about the dry delivery. A few days later we have started to make typical teenager-like mother jokes about H's Mom as some kind of retaliation. 

It hasn't taken long for them to find out about my red-haired sister and as we all know, dudes go crazy about red-haired women. They started asking me if she's hot, if she's taken, Bla Bla Bla. All that nonsense. It was all fun and games and very dry, dumb, teenager humor (we're all 30 plus but were having a blast being dumb with these kind of jokes - judge me.) 

Until today. M started asking me if I finally showed him a photo of my sister. I refused, cause it's supposed to be dumb jokes, nothing personal. He insisted. I refused again and became a bit clearer about me not wanting to share photos of my sister. H joined in, said that she's probably some kind of supermodel and that I want to hide her from them. They compared her to some red-haired girl we all know and that my sister is probably wayyyy hotter. I have told them both to stop, cause it's going too far and becoming too personal for me. M kept insisting and H said something like ""he doesn't want us to use her as jerk off material"". They both laughed. That's where I blew up and told them to already shut the fuck up. That I have told them several times and that they have crossed a line I have communicated several times. 

They then tried to negate everything I've said by telling me that we're just making the usual jokes. I insisted that it's way more personal than the usual ""haha your mom's cheap as well lol"" we are usually laughing about. You know, those situational jokes where someone says ""damn that's cheap"" and we answer with ""like H's mom"". 

I became louder as they didnt understand the problem I was having and told them that it's not about them making jokes, it's about the level of jokes they have crossed and that I have told them 4 or 5 times to stop, which they ignored and not only kept going, but being more and more disrespectful with every joke they made. 

They are now angry at me for being so stuck up. For making jokes about H's mom but not being able to take a joke about my sister. H didn't say anything about it except ""alright no more jokes about my mom for you then, as well"". Which is fine for me, but not the point of that whole argument. 

They've crossed a very clearly communicated line and don't care about it. I am so pissed that they disrespect me so much to ignore my ""no"" and ""stop"" several times.

So let me start by saying this all happened a few years ago because friend #1 came out one day to a bar with friend #2 and a bunch of others. Friend 2 paid the tab at the bar and just said he’d split the bill and let us know how much to send him. Everyone who went had a fair share of drinks and/or food that night except friend 1 who just had half an appetizer we split and one other drink. Friend 2 asked him to pay 75 dollars since it was split evenly and friend 1 was not paying because he didn’t consume the same as everyone else. I told Friend 2 that he should just split the difference amongst everyone else and call it a day but he chooses to die on that hill and now they don’t speak to eachother. 

Fast forward to today, I’m getting married at the end of the year and my bachelor party’s coming up. Friend 1 is a groomsman and friend 2 is not. I gave friend 1 a choice and asked him if I invite friend 2 (who’s very close with another group of friends I’m inviting) will you feel comfortable at the bachelor party?

70,1ctmk82,AITA for arguing over a mattress?,"AITA for being upset over a mattress?

I (48F) have a sister named Jamie (52F) and a brother named Chad (46M). Our parents recently passed and we inherited all of their belongings. 

Our parents purchased a brand new mattress for their guest room about 6 months before they passed. It was a nice mattress that cost about $1000 and by the time we inherited it, it was barely used. I really wanted it but Jamie said her son needed it for his new apartment so I let them have it. Chad drove 3 hours away to Jamie’s house and delivered the mattress to her. 

About a year later, Jamie’s son got a new job so he relocated to another state and didn’t want to bring the mattress with him. Therefore, he brought it back to Jamie’s house. Jamie stored it in her dining room until she could figure out what else to do with it. 

Jamie called me to tell me that I could have the mattress now. My car wasn’t big enough for the mattress so Chad agreed to drive back up there (3 hours away) whenever he had the time & room in his truck. We never told Jamie a specific time or date as to when we’d pick it up. 

Chad was unable to retrieve the mattress for about 3 months due to some medical issues and managing his company. I did not push him during this time as the mattress was no longer the priority & I figured we’d retrieve the mattress once everything was settled. I kept Jamie updated to let her know that and she was ok with that. 

Once everything had settled about 3 months later, Chad called and said he could get it in about a week. I told Jamie and she said that was okay. However, Jamie called me 2-3 days later and said that she was no longer willing to keep the mattress any longer & was giving it away to her neighbor. 

This upset me because Jamie knew the entire situation and had said she’d been fine with keeping it at her house up until this point. Also, she never told me she was going to ask someone else if they could have the mattress, if I didn’t get it within a certain time frame. I told her how I felt and Jamie responded by saying “you should be glad that I didn’t charge you rent for keeping the mattress at my home for this long” even though she was the one who originally wanted the mattress in the first place. 

I dropped the conversation, told Chad to not go get the mattress, & she ended up giving the mattress to the neighbor. 

It’s been a while since this occurred but Chad and I make jokes at times about this situation. We just don’t mention it to her cause she gets angry whenever we bring up “the mattress situation”…

AITA for being upset with her over this? 

**edit for clarification: I offered to rent a u-haul and retrieve the mattress myself but Chad & Jamie both told me not to. Jamie said to just get it whenever we had the chance. That’s why I was so confused & caught off-guard when she got angry about it and gave the mattress away days before I was finally able to retrieve it. Also, I didn’t want to buy another mattress myself because I had already agreed with her that I’d take that one. I didn’t want to go back on our agreement and leave her stuck with the mattress indefinitely. I felt that would’ve caused more of an issue than her keeping it for me. Lastly, both this did not cause any problems with our family. That’d be ridiculous. We still get along well & see each other often.

We all told her to just take care of herself. Our friends asked to hang out, she said she wanted to skip. We all said it was fine. She went to lunch with my mom and I on Sunday for Mother’s Day even though she was having a rough day. Which I and my mom both really appreciated.

Today, we had plans with my siblings and then dinner with my grandparents. She said she didn’t want to go out with my siblings and I because she wasn’t feeling well mentally. I said that was fine, but I was a little annoyed with her. Now she’s saying she doesn’t want to go to dinner with my grandparents either even after taking the whole day to herself. I told her that I feel as though she’s being selfish and she doesn’t seem to want to spend time with my family or our friends. This has been going on for about a week or two and it’s really irritating me.

I asked her to please come to dinner anyway because she missed the activities this morning with my siblings and she said I was being unfair and unsupportive. AITA?",,1.049125075340271,1,0

74,1ctl9zw,AITA for not buying concert tickets for my fiance? ,"My fiance moved in with me 5 months ago. I upgraded us to a 2bdr apartment under the impression that she'd find a job and start paying a portion of rent. It's been 5 months and she hasn't secured a job because she's picky and won't work retail, grocery store, fast food, or basically anything involving customer service... She does doordash, but only if I'm with her for safety. Defeats the purpose since my job pays much more than what she could possibly get from Door Dash.

There's a concert coming up that she really wants to go to, but she doesn't have money for tickets. The tickets are $490, which I can afford, but I don't want to for a couple reasons;

1. She hasn't gotten a job and it feels like she isn't being serious about getting one.
2. I now pay almost 50% more rent for our new apartment.
3. We recently procured some medical bills (both of us had a visit to the hospital recently), now we have $1500 of medical debt.

She's all up in arms about this now. Blaming me that she'll miss the last performance of this artist. All I told her was ""I can't really afford to pay for those tickets. We have debt I'm trying to get us out of, and I want to continue saving for a house with what's left of my income.."" Her response was that she'd pay me back when she gets a job, but I just said I can't afford it sorry.

Am I the ass for not buying this concert ticket for her?

EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up. So many comments! I'm seeing a general consensus to either breakup, kick her out, or give her a deadline. I will consider these, and I definitely see how this is a major red flag now.

Something I forgot to mention is she lived in another state before moving in with me. So she had to quit her job. She's never had an issue with holding a job, but getting one seems to be the problem here, especially with how picky she is.

Thanks for all the comments and advice. I will be having a serious discussion with her before considering marriage. This was truly eye opening

# IMPORTANT EDIT:

We had a good talk about this. She's going to get a temporary retail / customer service job until she can secure a desired job. She doesn't want to be a mooch and she admittedly told me she was just scared to go back to customer service. We agreed on a deadline of the end of July.

75,1ctl4im,AITA for making my step mom wait downstairs and using her glass ," I (31F) might be the AH for something that happened 5 weeks. 

The morning of my wedding was SUPER stressful. Lots of things went wrong and we were RUSHING to get our photos taken quickly. 
We had an upstairs section of the venue for photos that the venue was supposed to keep private, but did not. Despite having lots of space downstairs, everyone who arrived early chose to stand in the hallway upstairs next to where we were trying to do photos. 

The noise and chaos was stressing me out and we were stuck in this small hot room.  We had  champagne and glasses for us to use for photographs in the hall, but we realized we were one glass short. When we were trying to figure out what happened of my bridesmaids says “well Kathy (my step mom 56F) is drinking from one.” I should have realized at the time that since our champagne bottle was unopened, Kathy’s glass was not our missing glass, but I didn’t. Regardless Kathy said “bride can use mine, I’m her step mom she won’t mind drinking after me!” 

I was so annoyed by everything I stuck my heard in the hall and sternly announced that everyone who was not involved in pictures needed to wait downstairs as they were not supposed to be up here. There was a lot of grumbling but people relocated. As I processed more I then called through the door, “Wait Kathy, before you go we do need your champagne glass”. And she gave it to me. 

I thought that was the end of it, but later when taking a photo with me dad he said “Kathy is really angry with you you know for accusing her of stealing your champagne and kicking her out from the upstairs”. 
I did definitely think at the time Kathy took the venue champagne, But I never voiced that to her and I did kick her and everyone else out of the upstairs when they did not know they weren’t supposed to be up there. 

When it was time to do the whole family photo, Kathy tried to avoid being in the photo at all. my step brother forced her to come, she rolled her eyes and stood next to me, but refused to smile, look at me, or talk to me. 

The stress from the day, then having someone mad at me just became too much. I had to take a break and cry for like 45 minutes. Kathy took photos with everyone else in the family smiling like crazy during the night then left the reception early because she had a headache.

When I told my dad how after he told me Kathy was pissed and then she was so visibly pissed in the middle of photos that I ended up crying for a while that morning. he just said “oh shit.” And changed the subject. 

The next day, Kathy acted fine with me and had never brought it up

My mom wanted her to come home after a party she wasn't allowed to go but instead she stayed at his and got scared to come home. So basically my mom told her she could live at his.

Is what she claims... but after her pathological lying history I don't know what to believe anymore. She got knocked up and had a son that has been spoiled by his grandmom (dad's side, he basically lived with her) and his parents on the weekends (she still barely looks after him).

Fastforward to 14 years later, we get a call after not hearing from her for 12 years (I always tried to contact her on her b-day and on christmas, but she never picked up). She wanted to leave him, she was afraid he would do something to her. Me (shortly living at my parents again after breaking up with my boyfriend) and my parents get very worried and do everything in our power to help her figure out how to leave. It took us a year to convince her to come to us on a day she could get off of work that he wasn't home either (he was unemployed due to ptsd as a prisonguard).

My mom decided we would pay 800€ rent in total a month. In the beginning we agreed to pay 400 each since we each had our room (I decided to give her the main bedroom which is the largest because I wanted the room with built in shelves for my art supplies).

After she got shared custody of her son, he came to live with us every other week (I don't have and don't want kids) I like my quiet after coming home from a hard day at work at the store or my unpaid internship). After this custody we decided she could pay 3/5 of the general costs like water and electricity, since her son only lives with us part time. But I discussed with her that she would also pay 500 euros for rent and myself 300 since they get 2 bedrooms and I only have one. (Because when you get housemates you each pay per room).

78,1ctkpg4,AITA For expecting my husband to pick up slack at home when I have to work more,"My husband (38M) and I (36F) have been married for 10 years and have 3 kids (12, 8, & 6).  I was a SAHM from the time our first was born until last fall when our youngest started kindergarten.  My mom was a SAHM for me and my siblings and I wanted to give my kids that same level of care and love.  I have since reentered the workforce and am trying to make up for lost time in terms of my desired career path.  

I have a good job at a reputable company.  I was hired for an entry-level position last fall but have already been promoted twice.  I'll admit some of that is due to high turnover in some positions, but I have also been busting my butt and it's been paying off.  

However, there have been some drawbacks.  I have been working a lot which obviously means I'm not home as much.  My husband works full-time too for a business his family owns and operates, so his schedule is much more flexible than mine.  As a result, he has been taking on a lot more of the childcare and household duties.  

Since my most recent promotion, I have been working roughly 50-55 hours every week.  That's been going on for about 6 weeks now.  This is mostly because I am trying to learn this new position on the fly and because I find the work exciting and rewarding.  I really do enjoy it.  It's like I've rediscovered a part of me that I had forgotten after being a SAHM all those years.  

My husband has been griping about me working so much.  He's not a good cook and the kids complain that he doesn't make dinner the same way I used to.  He has essentially been trying to stick to the status quo that we established when I was a SAHM in regards to chores.  Which was I basically do all the inside the house stuff and he takes care of all the outdoor stuff.  Of course, there is some crossover but that was how we usually divided things.  But now, since I'm not home as often, a lot of things I usually did aren't being done in as timely a manner or being done differently by my husband.  

He thinks I'm working too much, I'm neglecting the kids, I'm neglecting him, I'm neglecting chores, etc.  I reminded him that this is a big change that we are all going to have to adjust too.  He said that the only one in the family gaining anything from this change is me.  He then asked if I was being asked to work so much or if I was doing that on my own.  When I told him I was doing that on my own he flipped out.  

He told me I am being taken advantage of at work and that I'm being naive to think otherwise.  When I reminded him that I had already been promoted twice he told me that's great, but what is the cost of that in other areas of our life.  I told him he's being a jerk for diminishing my accomplishments and he told me I have been out of the workforce for so long I don't know when I'm being taken advantage of.

So I (15M) have been talking to this girl (16F) for about 3 weeks now, and I think it’s safe to say that we both like eachother. But there was this boy who asked her out and he was really racist. So she asked me if I would help her friendzone him and I agreed. So yesterday I helped her friendzone him but I helped her over text. But after we friendzoned the guy, she called my brother (17M) to tell him. She called him at 11:30PM and they were on the phone until 4:30AM. And this really broke me because I’m used to always being second to him. I’m the second born, he’s always been good at talking to girls. So I just have no idea what I should do.

For context, the girl said that she doesn’t think she can mentally date anyone but we’ve been flirting over text for about a week now.

Edit: We aren’t supposed to be on electronics past 11 on weekdays and he was being really loud while I was trying to sleep. I had asked him to please be quieter and he would whisper for 2 minutes and then go back to being loud. So I don’t think that I’m mad that he was talking to her I’m just mad about how loud he was and how long he was on with her

82,1ctjvuh,AITA for saying my portion of the inheritance is too small?,"My brother (50) is mom’s favorite, and my sister (47) is second. I (49F) come in last. Mom would never intentionally treat us differently; but she always had just a little more time, patience, and even money for the other 2.

I am on disability; but in the early 00’s I was managing my condition well enough that I started a PhD program with a full scholarship and a student loan. The course handbook specifically said not to take on outside employment due to the courseload.

About this time, my sister and mom went in together on a house-flip. But when the house was finished, my sister and her husband decided to live in it. So mom retroactively gifted the down-payment ($100k) to my sister. About 5 years later, mom decided to gift my brother and I $100k each to make it fair. The amount was not adjusted for increased market value of the house - which was fine, but this it is relevant later. 

My brother chose to invest his money in the stock market, and lost it in the crash of 08. I wanted to invest in out-of-town real estate and use the income to support myself; but mom said that she would only give me the money if I used it to buy a home, because I needed somewhere to live. Obviously I should have refused, since I knew I couldn’t carry a mortgage; but hindsight is 20/20. I got a roommate and a job; but ended up having to drop out of my PhD program and sell the condo to avoid foreclosure.

I struggled to get back on my feet. About 2014 Mom offered to buy a condo for me to rent from her.

I found a condo for $169,000, and mom paid outright, so there was no mortgage.

2 years ago, mom put me on the title, so we are joint owners. I continued to pay rent for the past 2 years.

Last year both my sister and my brother got divorced.

My sister was forced to sell the house mentioned above. She used the proceeds, plus an additional $400,000 gift from mom as a down-payment on a $1.28M house. Mom moved into the basement suite of this house, but she is not on the title.

Mom then gave my brother $400,000 to buy his ex-wife out of their condo. He will be providing her (mom) with monthly financial support – I don’t know how much – but she is not on the title of his condo.

They all say this is fair because the current market value of my condo is $400,000.

This is not about the money. This is about how I get treated differently than my siblings. I feel like they see me as the family looser that can’t be trusted with money because I’d just squander it if I had it anyways (the increase in market value of my condo over the past 8 years was by far the largest factor in the increase in mom’s net worth over that time period. This was not an accident - I know how to pick real estate.)

I’m just so tired of trying to protect my self-esteem from my family. Am I the asshole?

84,1ctjnwp,AITA: My best friend completely lost her shit on me and has been stonewalling me and all of our friends for seven days. We live together. ,"My best friend and I, up until this point, have had a beautiful relationship. Let’s call her Rose. We understand each other as women in a way no one else ever could, and truly I love her to death. We lived in the same city for a year before both moving to slower lifestyles, eventually moving back to the city we love, but together this time! We moved into a shitty apartment with my boyfriend, made do with that for six months, and on May 1 of this year we all moved in to a beautiful home. 

Now, I feel like it’s important to mention that my best friend and I both grew up with fathers who are extremely confrontational, even abusive at times. Neither of us respond well to confrontational triggers, but every time we’ve had a disagreement in the past, she’s just left and then we talk about whenever she decides she’s ready. 

If you can’t tell already, she’s anxious avoidant, and I’m anxious attachment. 

Well, I got invited to a graduation party for one of my friends that my best friend just met for the first time. The graduate friend, we’ll call her Eva, and I have been friends for yeeeeaaars. Longer than me and my best friend have been friends, we just aren’t as close. So this party meant a huge deal to me, since she wasn’t inviting a lot of people and she had things planned for the moment we got there until the moment we left. I asked Eva if I could bring my best friend and my partner, and she said yes! We were all very excited, and I was grateful she was letting me bring extra friends!

Come the day of the party, which we’ve known about for a week now, I ask my best friend if she’s wearing a bathing suit. She says she doesn’t know, so I offer her a couple of my own. Even now, she doesn’t seem very engaged or excited, which is fine, she just got off of work, but I was trying to lift her spirits. She went back and forth with herself on whether she would shower, whether she would wear a bathing suit, whether she would even change. So I let her be in the living room for a while to decide for herself while I went to take a shower. 

I got out of the shower probably 15 minutes later and said “Rose, the showers open!” She said “okay!” Got up, went to her room to do what I assumed to be grab a change of clothes or get ready in whatever manner she decided, and then she went back to sit down on the couch. While I’m getting ready, I had to leave my room a couple times to go to the bathroom for things, and each time I left she was just sitting on the couch. Keep in mind, the party starts at 4. It is 3:30 at this point. With an hour drive. 

I’m starting to get a little anxious about time, so I asked from the bathroom “Hey are you ready Rose?” And the thing is /I genuinely did not know if she was ready or not/. She had just told me she didn’t know what she would wear, so I didn’t feel uncomfortable asking if she was going to wear what she had on.

She snapped back at me “No?” And something else along the lines of “obviously not” and I started getting more anxious because I wasn’t trying to be rude, I just hate being late. Really bad. And she knows this. I started feeling distressed and I was like “Rose I wasn’t asking to be rude, I just didn’t know.” I then left the bathroom and went to my own room. 

She knocks on my door and asks if she can come in. I thought she’d just be getting her purse, but she opened the door and said “Sorry for snapping, but you had an attitude when you asked if I was ready.” I feel confused, because I genuinely didn’t. I was asking because /I didn’t know if she was ready./ I tell her this, and she just starts saying “Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.” WHILE IM TALKING. This drives me insane. My parents used to do it, so I just shut down. The last thing she pointedly says is, “Try considering me.” I have been!!!! I didn’t say this, and not to be harsh, but try considering that you are a guest of a guest, and we’re already late! And you are making no effort to change that. 

I sent her a text about how I appreciate the apology but it hurt my feelings that I wasn’t allowed to share my own thoughts in my own room without getting spoken over, and she responded back with: 

“Oh girl. No.. I went in there to speak to you. You never grant me an ear when I want to come to you about a boundary and didn’t even let me get to my point before cutting me off. So I wouldn’t let you get the stage after you didn’t want to hear me? But either way I’m not discussing this through text.” This hurt my feelings for one, because the opening line felt demeaning. The part about “getting the stage” was distilling my frustration into something much more performative than what it was, and when I asked her about what boundary she was setting, she said “I’ve just said I won’t discuss this through text and I’m heated and I don’t wanna talk either.”

This is where things start getting explosive. 
At this point, Rose, who is meant to be coming with us in one car, is not only not ready, but is refusing to engage with either of us. We don’t know if she’s ready, or at this point if she’s coming, and we are already late. 

I’ll admit, this next part was on me. She was in her room with her door closed, and through my frustration I started loudly saying “We’re already late!! I hate being late. It’s disrespectful!!” 

And then she was like “Then just fucking leave without me!” Fine. I went to her door and said “Are you coming at all?” She says something I can’t understand behind the door, so I said “Rose?!” And she said, with the most anger I’ve ever heard from her, “BITCH. WHAT?”

Absolutely not. I will not be spoken to like that, especially not as an adult. I say this, and she just starts literally targeting me saying “YOU NEVER FUCKING LOOK IN A MIRROR. YOUVE NEVER EVER ACTUALLY FUCKING LOOK AT YOURSELF.” This is so hurtful, because up until this exact point in time, she has never, EVER, made constructive criticism about the things she was saying. If she truly thought that, I wouldn’t have minded her bringing it up to me. But screaming things like that at me in a moment of anger? Absolutely not okay. And then she kept saying things like “I THOUGHT YOU WERE FUCKING LEAVING? WHY DONT YOU JUST FUCKING LEAVE?” Got at least one “FUCK YOU” in there, and other things I can’t even remember because they were so hurtful. However, I don’t think I will ever forget the majority of what she said. It was more than triggering, it hurt.

At 21 years old I haven’t had someone speak to me like that since I lived with my parents. 

Yall, it wrecked me bad. I‘ve been so anxious I’ve been hospitalized three times. I’ve thrown up probably over 30 times, and last night I even threw up blood. I doubt she even knows because even though she lives with us, she either goes to her brothers house or she goes in her room and stays there all night. I don’t know how she eats, drinks water, or lets her dog out that she keeps caged up all day just so even HER DOG can’t interact with us. She doesn’t look at my social media, OR our friends social media. She has effectively excommunicated our whole friend group over her own personal issues, that she refuses to communicate. 

I debated making this post for so long. I even debated telling our mutuals for days because I didn’t want her not to have her own opportunity to reach out to them. But after four days, she never did. And our closest friend said “no Reddit post will tell you who’s in the wrong. There is no excuse for stonewalling someone for seven entire days.” Which is true. I’m not even religious, and creation according to biblical genesis had already been done by now. This timeline is reaching finality. 

I guess my question is, what should I do? I can’t reach out to her saying I want to talk because she’s made it explicitly clear I am not to contact her until SHE is ready, but she has made absolutely no effort to do that. I also don’t know if even want to talk again, because at this point I’m so resentful and I’m not sure what edge could possibly do to rectify that. 

Dictionary definition of stonewalling: delay or block (a request, process, or person) by refusing to answer questions or by giving evasive replies. Complete disengagement. 

It’s one of the four horsemen of the relationship apocalypse, another being broadly targeted criticisms like “you always,” and “you never,” which she also did. 

I’m mostly sad. She is, slowly becoming was, my best friend. Every day she pretends that me or my friends don’t exist I grow more resentment. I haven’t lived a life without her in three years, and now we live together and she’s hurt me beyond repair. Please help with some advice. 

TLDR: My best friend irrevocably dented our relationship because of an emotional outburst, followed by cutting me and all my friends off for seven days. We live together. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I want to be friends, every time I see her I want to throw up from anxiety.

At this point, Rose, who is meant to be coming with us in one car, is not only not ready, but is refusing to engage with either of us. We don’t know if she’s ready, or at this point if she’s coming, and we are already late. 

I’ll admit, this next part was on me. She was in her room with her door closed, and through my frustration I started loudly saying “We’re already late!! I hate being late. It’s disrespectful!!” 

And then she was like “Then just fucking leave without me!” Fine. I went to her door and said “Are you coming at all?” She says something I can’t understand behind the door, so I said “Rose?!” And she said, with the most anger I’ve ever heard from her, “BITCH. WHAT?”

Absolutely not. I will not be spoken to like that, especially not as an adult. I say this, and she just starts literally targeting me saying “YOU NEVER FUCKING LOOK IN A MIRROR. YOUVE NEVER EVER ACTUALLY FUCKING LOOK AT YOURSELF.” This is so hurtful, because up until this exact point in time, she has never, EVER, made constructive criticism about the things she was saying. If she truly thought that, I wouldn’t have minded her bringing it up to me. But screaming things like that at me in a moment of anger? Absolutely not okay. And then she kept saying things like “I THOUGHT YOU WERE FUCKING LEAVING? WHY DONT YOU JUST FUCKING LEAVE?” Got at least one “FUCK YOU” in there, and other things I can’t even remember because they were so hurtful. However, I don’t think I will ever forget the majority of what she said. It was more than triggering, it hurt.

At 21 years old I haven’t had someone speak to me like that since I lived with my parents. 

Yall, it wrecked me bad. I‘ve been so anxious I’ve been hospitalized three times. I’ve thrown up probably over 30 times, and last night I even threw up blood. I doubt she even knows because even though she lives with us, she either goes to her brothers house or she goes in her room and stays there all night. I don’t know how she eats, drinks water, or lets her dog out that she keeps caged up all day just so even HER DOG can’t interact with us. She doesn’t look at my social media, OR our friends social media. She has effectively excommunicated our whole friend group over her own personal issues, that she refuses to communicate. 

I debated making this post for so long. I even debated telling our mutuals for days because I didn’t want her not to have her own opportunity to reach out to them. But after four days, she never did. And our closest friend said “no Reddit post will tell you who’s in the wrong. There is no excuse for stonewalling someone for seven entire days.” Which is true. I’m not even religious, and creation according to biblical genesis had already been done by now. This timeline is reaching finality. 

I guess my question is, what should I do? I can’t reach out to her saying I want to talk because she’s made it explicitly clear I am not to contact her until SHE is ready, but she has made absolutely no effort to do that. I also don’t know if even want to talk again, because at this point I’m so resentful and I’m not sure what edge could possibly do to rectify that. 

Dictionary definition of stonewalling: delay or block (a request, process, or person) by refusing to answer questions or by giving evasive replies. Complete disengagement. 

It’s one of the four horsemen of the relationship apocalypse, another being broadly targeted criticisms like “you always,” and “you never,” which she also did. 

I’m mostly sad. She is, slowly becoming was, my best friend. Every day she pretends that me or my friends don’t exist I grow more resentment. I haven’t lived a life without her in three years, and now we live together and she’s hurt me beyond repair. Please help with some advice. 

TLDR: My best friend irrevocably dented our relationship because of an emotional outburst, followed by cutting me and all my friends off for seven days. We live together. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I want to be friends, every time I see her I want to throw up from anxiety. ",,0.03379986807703972,0,0

87,1ctj8n1,WIBTA for threatening to not return for Christmas.,"So for a bit of context, I (18M) need to begin 4 years before today when during the middle of covid lockdown in the UK my sister (28F) selfishly decided to bring her new boyfriend (27M) over who we had never met before to stay at my parent's house for a week given we had never talked to him and his first impressions such as not bringing gifts or a thank you gift for letting him stay his awful habits like lacking on personal hygiene. It is from here that my dislike for this chap began. He claimed to hold a senior position in the judiciary something we have since disproven given that no ceremony has occurred and he was only called to the bar a year prior meaning he couldn't hold the position he claimed to have.  Recently after years of privately caring for my grandmother (102) now deceased alongside both my parents and my brother, we were saddened to hear of her death despite our best efforts in caring for her.

My sister at no stage helped us care for my grandmother and I should point out that I had been caring for her including with toiletries since I was 14. My sister hardly visited my grandmother despite living with us even when she was asked too and her boyfriend talked to my grandmother for less than 5 seconds leading to my grandmother referring to him publicly as a 'tight bastard'. Nevertheless without the permission of my parents  invited him the funeral for 'emotional support' yet again i refer to my point that my sister actively avoided my grandmother despite her severe decline in health  and now wants to actively defy my grandmothers preference for close family only at the funeral.

This week I am planning to confront my sister for overstepping the boundaries consistently only looking after herself and always making everything about herself regardless this included passing on all my information in regard to GCSE results, A-level grades and where im going to Uni to her boyfriend. Under this premise of confronting her and refusing to come back to my home for Christmas unless my parents stopped their preferential treatment of her over everyone else. For  a bit of context on this treatment, my parents have previously allowed my sister to get away from stealing hundred's of pounds that I saved in a money box from the age of 8-13. In addition to openly calling me a mistake always letting my sisters boyfriend stay and catering to the every need of them.

I wouldn't have such an issue with them if they were honest with when they were staying and when they were leaving. and for instance the lack of transparency and her constant lies. This year I have already threatened my brother that unless my parents start calling out all my sister's stunts I will not return for Christmas when my sister and her boyfriend will be staying for a few weeks.

So in summary I know this was a bit of a ramble and I'm happy to clarify anything in the comments.

Edit—-
Most people are just calllng me gross for my habit. 
I don’t stink NONE of my clients know I smoke so the know it alls with that….
And I wasn’t sitting on THEIR stairs. I was UNDERCOVER. where did o say I sat at HIS back door? Yall just saw the word “smoking” and went off 
And smoking and the “other nicotine stuff” are different that is why I choose to SMOKE. Not the “other stuff”
I’m not asking if I should quit. 
People calling me a lost cause and stuff the real assholes are you guys. Telling a stranger how to live there lives. 

I’m a 23f hairdresser with BRIGHT red hair. I work fulltime 9 hours a day, I get 1x 30 min lunch so I fit 2 smokes and food in that time. 

I know this is a gross habit, I don’t want any of my clients to see me so I normally smoke out the back of my building in the garden behind cars but can be seen from another businesses loading dock and our toilets are around there. NOT open to public. 

One time about a year ago it was raining and I didn’t want to get wet, so I sat flush against the wall on a bottom step not near any door but the toilet and smoked. He came and told me too move and i honestly did. 

We also have a big butcher shop in our building and they all smoke in the open and right next to doors. Sometimes large groups, this guy installed a bunch of signs. 
But none are actually within my countries legal laws with smoking but I did not want to step on toes so I sat in my garden and chilled for 30 mins a day 6 days a week. I will even sit there in light rain with an umbrella. 

Today was heavier, i did try to sit in my garden but it wet my outfit and I just wanted to sit down. So, knowing he has seen me in my garden every other day… I thought today he would understand..so I sat out of anyones way on a bottom step, he doesn’t use them steps. And can still only be seen by that business. Believe me, if there was anywhere else I could go I really would!! 
I had only just “lit up” and he came out and said to me “yep, another one that can’t read a f***ing sign”
And started slamming the boxes he had in the bins. I said “hey, I’m never here, I’m a hairdresser , I can’t get my hair wet” (I do hope yall understand, I’m too busy to just fix it) 

He replied “that’s not my f***ing problem!” 
And stormed off. 
I was shaken and literally just went and sat in the rain a tree, my lunch got wet damn but idk I felt I didn’t need to be shamed out that bad for my habit. I don’t sit there all day…the butchers are all over there and I see him say nothing to them, just them signs. 

I think I want to go and say something about the way he spoke to me but I wanna see what a bunch of strangers think about the situation first… 

AITA???? 



Tl;dr 
I 23f was Having a smoke on my 30 min lunch out the back of my work building in the rain under cover.

 I am embarrassed of my habit so I normally smoke in garden far enough back that only
A loading dock to a business can see me. 

Well heavy rain drenched my garden oasis and even though I was a bit aware a staff from the business I thought he had seen me stay away enough and that he would understand and lots of butchers in groups hang there all day, everyday. 

I say hidden from public but defs closer for cover  he came out swearing at me and I ended up in the rain missing out on lunch lol. Minimal defense from me tbh. Which is why I want to say something about the way he spoke to me. But AITA for smoking there anyway?

89,1ctirci,AITA for making my parents and younger brother mad when discussing pick-up arrangements from prom? ,"I (17F, 11th grade) and my brother (16M, 10th grade) are going to prom for the first time. Normally only 11th and 12th graders go to prom in most schools, but my school is a small school and they need enough people for the prom venue, so underclassmen are allowed to go too. 

Our prom is this weekend, and I wanted my parents to let me drive myself to prom. I’ve had my driver's license for a year now. The reason I want to drive myself to prom is because I don’t want to have to leave prom at the same time as my brother. 

My brother generally doesn't do too well at events like Prom or Homecoming because of the loud music and all the people. He’s only going this time because his friends are going. However, because he doesn’t like the loud music and all the people too much, he gets tired and wants to go home early from events like this. The issue I’ve had with him in the past about this is when the two of us went to homecoming last school year(Sept 2022). Homecoming and Prom are both from 8-11 pm. I wanted to stay all the way until 11, but around 10:30, my brother got tired and wanted to go home. My dad came to pick him up and then they called me because they wanted me to leave homecoming and go home as well. However, I was having fun and didn’t want to leave early. Eventually I gave in and left because my brother kept yelling at me over the phone to make me leave. I was bitter that I had to leave early, and I thought that he ruined the fun night I had by forcing me to leave with him. The following morning, we got into a big fight about what had happened that night. 

Last homecoming(Sept 2023) we coordinated pick-up arrangements better and had my parents pick us up separately from Homecoming so we could both go home when we wanted to. This went well and my brother and I were both satisfied by this arrangement. 

I was bitter about him ruining my fun 1 ½ years ago, and I don’t want it to happen again for a significant night like Prom. I mentioned what happened during the homecoming last school year, and that I got mad at him because he forced me to leave early when I didn’t want to. He got mad at me for bringing it up because last year’s homecoming is a sore spot for both of us. My parents got mad because I kept bringing it up, and they thought I was making too big of a deal about it. 

Now that I have my drivers license, I want to drive myself to prom so I can leave when I want to leave. However, my parents are reluctant to let me drive because it will be dark when I come back, and there is construction on the roads from our house to the venue. My dad said that he’s fine driving two times to the venue and back to pick my brother and I up separately, but I don’t want to inconvenience him. Eventually the rest of my family told me to drop the topic, because we had to get ready for school while my parents had to get ready for work.

Honestly, I think that because my husband is Mexican and doesn't speak English, he felt powerful by threatening him to the cops. My husband was clearly scared and offered him money back but purchaser said no, he wanted a full refund. We don't know if he messed something up or tampered with it after 24 hours. Usually when you go to a thrift store or purchased used items, there's a no refund. You take it, it's yours. I really don't know what to do! I wish I could post screenshots on how he came in agressive.


At first, we offered money back and he didn't want to take it. We don't know if it was tampered with or if he messed with it. Now he wants money back but after all the agressive comments, I don't believe he should be entitled to it.",0.0,0.08345893770456314,0,1

A little back story, I'm a 17 year old. And I'm done with my dad's bs. Some back story I've never been close to him even when he was married to my mom. He was that dad that would only be there for all the fun stuff, but never home and if he was he would always do yard work. Always putting a wall between everyone in the house just saying. He would always put the pressure on house work/ rasing us to my mom, and wonder why we didn't have the same connection as when I was younger.
Before and after the divorce my mom has told me who he actually was and everything clicked. He would cheat and lie, things I've had to deal with in other drama I've been in and it's a hard line no one should pass since that's a line to be cut off. And didn't want to have a connection with him at all. I would since he's my ""dad"" but the way he has acted towards me isn't the best from what I want to do, the college location. And how he acted when I got in. I got the call from my college when he was moving out, I went up to him when I got into my dream college and rolled his eyes at me. A different day he wore the college t shirt get got out to dinner with me but that was one thing that broke the connection. He also shown his sico self when I was in the back of his car and wanted to find my mom to sign papers, my sibling thought she was at a restaurant but she was at home. But my dad went up and down every row to find her car. There's been others but can say all.
I haven't been treated right from his family either, so when it was thanksgiving I walked out because I was being ignored for the 6th year in a row (my mom was the only person that would talk to me). And that was the end of the contact with him, he would text me how it used to be and how things have changed. So I blocked him 2 weeks ago after 5 months of ignoring his messages, he's blind to I don't want to talk to him, my mom has told him and me not answering him. He still doesn't understand.
He doesn't have any accountability, always blames my mom for what happens, never his own. Only thinks of himself. Because of this he still cries, why, don't I want to talk to him/ keeps causing my mom more problems/ drama she doesn't want.

But with that anger I feel like I might be the asshole because I cause more drama/ make a scene, imbarrese my mom, and air out family drama Infront of my dad's ""new girlfriend"".

93,1cthk67,AITA for telling my niece her hair stinks and looks greasy?,"I (27F) have a much older brother who has my niece Laya (18F). He and his wife live in my neighborhood so I see Laya a lot, as she’s living at home while going to CC. 

Laya is the type of girl to try out a lot of beauty hacks and fads. She’s done fake freckles, douyin makeup, hair glossing and more. However, recently she’s been on a natural/ holistic kick. Part of it is training her hair to produce less oil, which entails her washing her hair only once a week.

Let me tell you, her hair is so stinky and greasy. It literally looks wet with grease! I know some hair types don’t need to be washed regularly, but she has the same hair as me. Thin, fine, and very straight.

Recently, I was going on a coffee run and took Laya with me. Her hair smelled so bad I literally had to crack the window, and I was worried about the smell seeping into my seats. When we were waiting in the drive thru, I gently asked her if I could tell her something sensitive. She said sure, so I told her that her new hair routine wasn’t working out and was making her hair nasty. I reminded her that I think she’s beautiful and I love how adventurous she is with trying trends, but I’d want someone to let me know if my hair was smelly.

Laya took it well, and she said she’d ask her best friend Ava if she’d smelled any funk coming from her. Ava is a very blunt girl, so I’m sure she’ll tell Laya the same thing. We drank our coffee, I dropped Laya home, and everything was normal.

However, my SIL Ashley somehow got wind of the conversation, and she sent me a nasty text. She accused me of “tearing down Laya’s confidence” and “shaming her natural body functions.” I haven’t replied to the message yet — just got it yesterday — and I will probably talk to my brother before I answer. But I think it’s better to tell someone about an issue so they can address it, and I only talked to Laya because I love her and don’t want her to be embarrassed by someone at school etc.

94,1cthhrt,AITA: Refused to deliver supplies for my ill grandpa,"So recently my grandpa got sick and is being treated in the hospital. He often needs us to get him certain objects since he is staying there for a while. He is very old and weak and has Parkinson.

Since most of my uncles are broken irresponsible alcoholics usually it's up to my dad and my mom to help my grandpa get the things he needs. However, this one time they couldn't, so my mom asked me if I could help him this time. I declined since I'm busy working on my tesis (I'm 21yo). Also because it doesn't feel right for me to do it when I'm busy doing important stuff and my full grown mid-40ish yo uncles can't be bothered to help their own dad and are just goofing around drinking and doing nothing.

So, since full grown adults fail to be responsible with their dad, I have to carry the emotional pressure of being able to help. To have to choose between working on my tesis or my grandpa.

It's not that it would've take me a lot of time, it just that I already struggle with productivity and to have these sudden changes in focus and priorities worsens it, and I feel blocked.

And after writing this I feel like the asshole because I could have just helped regardless of how useless some family members are. You know, just do it for my grandpa.

My wife and I are in a little bit of a predicament and we don't know how to navigate this situation. Our oldest son (age 4) attends a preschool, where he has a blast. This school is absolutely amazing and he is absolutely thriving there. He is a very affectionate boy - he loves snuggling, hugs, etc. This will be relevant. Lately we've noticed that whenever he spends an extensive amount of time with a classroom assistant, K (20s), he comes home smelling RANK. Like, drive home from picking him up with the windows down, give him a bath as soon as he gets home. It smells like he's a little boy with grown-man BO. Usually we're just managing it, but ... Well, it's starting to stick around. We wash his car seat, we have air fresheners, etc.

My sister and I have both struggled with extreme depression our whole life, unfortunately a lot of our relatability to eachother is complaining about that. I never noticed this until I got engaged, she seemed irritated but I let it go.

My mom’s side of the family doesn’t care about weddings, it’s not something special to them & I’ve always known that. We decided to elope.

My mom & sister came down to visit me & while at dinner they made comments about the wedding like how my mom felt unhappy that she couldn’t financially contribute but his family can (this is BS my mom has good money she just spends it on herself) and I have no problem with that. I don’t expect anything from her. And my sister was making comments about how she always saw my wedding as something her, our other sister and me all did together. I was so shocked and confused this wasn’t like them at all.

I decided to do the one thing everyone sais not to do and ditch my wedding plan for something to make my family happy, we planned a surprise wedding. Everyone thinks we’re eloping and this way my mom & sister would be the only ones who could do all the planning with me. Side note: my sister has a lot of jealousy about how much his cousins love me and felt annoyed at them helping me plan my elopement. Long story short my wedding is in a month & it’s been radio silence ever since I told them, my mom has been nice but doesn’t initiate conversation or ask questions. My sister has been acting like it’s not happening, I gave her exactly what she wanted and she’s just pretending it’s not happening it’s so strange. My fiancés mom took me to get my dress, my shoes.

behavior and left. He then started mocking me for my action, so I made it clear

what I was studying wasn't a real career. Later, Alfred said he chose an easier

it applies here. After all, they're ""Alfred's"" friends. I won't be

drift apart because of me, leaving him worse off than he already was. I would

98,1cth425,AITA for Not Attending My Sister’s Award Ceremony?,"I (25M) am currently in New York for my sister’s (22F) graduation ceremony. I got in with my mom and we stayed in the same (pretty crappy) hotel. Today, my sister is getting an award for her performing arts school at a ceremony today ahead of the actual graduation. My mom (50F) and I met in the lobby this morning, and she was already in a sour mood because the hotel gave her the wrong room and couldn’t get it changed until later today.

We went outside to call an Uber, when I noticed on mom’s phone that she put the pickup location in a spot that would require a ten minute walk. I tried to explain this to her, but mom insisted it was the right pick up location. It wasn’t. She tried it again from another location, and the same thing happened, with her getting mad every time I tried to explain why. 

Eventually, she gave me the phone and said “You figure it out if you know it so well!” I finally set the app to come to our location, but in a case of really bad luck, the driver cancelled on after 10 minutes of waiting. Mom chastised me for doing it wrong and she decided to problem was where we were standing.

We then spent the next 30 minutes walking around New York looking for a spot she thought we be good. We stopped outside a Mariott, and I tried to remind mom to set the right location on the app. Tried is the term to use, since she told me to shut up before I even finished. At that point I had enough and just sat back and let Mom do what she wanted to do. Big surprise, she set the location wrong again. She asked me why that happened and I said “I could have told you if you didn’t tell me to shut up”. That set her off and she told me to find my own way to the awards show.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-05-16,"AITA for Not Attending My Sister’s Award Ceremony? I (25M) am currently in New York for my sister’s (22F) graduation ceremony. I got in with my mom and we stayed in the same (pretty crappy) hotel. Today, my sister is getting an award for her performing arts school at a ceremony today ahead of the actual graduation. My mom (50F) and I met in the lobby this morning, and she was already in a sour mood because the hotel gave her the wrong room and couldn’t get it changed until later today.

We went outside to call an Uber, when I noticed on mom’s phone that she put the pickup location in a spot that would require a ten minute walk. I tried to explain this to her, but mom insisted it was the right pick up location. It wasn’t. She tried it again from another location, and the same thing happened, with her getting mad every time I tried to explain why. 

Eventually, she gave me the phone and said “You figure it out if you know it so well!” I finally set the app to come to our location, but in a case of really bad luck, the driver cancelled on after 10 minutes of waiting. Mom chastised me for doing it wrong and she decided to problem was where we were standing.

We then spent the next 30 minutes walking around New York looking for a spot she thought we be good. We stopped outside a Mariott, and I tried to remind mom to set the right location on the app. Tried is the term to use, since she told me to shut up before I even finished. At that point I had enough and just sat back and let Mom do what she wanted to do. Big surprise, she set the location wrong again. She asked me why that happened and I said “I could have told you if you didn’t tell me to shut up”. That set her off and she told me to find my own way to the awards show.

Me and my coworker, let's call him Billy, have an agreement: we cover for each other one Saturday each, so that we have a free day every too weeks.

Well, after I had already worked a Saturday(4th), Billy asked me to work the following Saturday(11th) too and, in exchange, that same week he worked Monday. 

For me was then obvious that Billy would've worked the following Saturday(18th), which otherwise would've been my third consecutive Saturday.
He wasn't of the same opinion, saying that I actually owned him an additional day since he worked Monday. 
Now, I sat with him, showed him several times the days he and I worked (or didn't), yet he didn't budge.

Honestly made me feel like I was crazy for how sure he was of his point.

My apologies but this may be a bit long.  Please redirect me if this needs to be in another forum.

  
I (49F) met my fiance (M48) 5 years ago.  We'll call him D.  D had a child (19F) from a previous marriage who has always lived primarily with their mother but D paid child support and had frequent visitation.   We'll call her  M.  I have two children from a previous relationship as well (13F, 22M) and D gets along very well with both of them.  I know you've heard this before, but he really is the love of my life.  I've never met anyone who is so sweet, funny, intelligent, kind.  

M makes poor choices.  The issues have always been apparent but have been getting worse.  M dropped out of school, has been fired from several entry level jobs for calling out, missing shifts, being late, etc...  She also had a child with someone who also cannot hold a job.  We tried having her live with us while she was pregnant but frankly, it was so stressful, she had to move back in with her mother.  (Calling the ambulance 8 times because her belly hurt - nothing was ever found wrong, stealing from my children, stealing from us, ordering food delivery twice a day and expecting D to keep paying for it, leaving a huge mess and expecting others to pick/clean it up, snatching the wrist of my 2 y/o grandson because he picked up a piece of paper in the living room that she then threw away, staying up until 2 or 3 talking on discord because that was when her friends were up - keeping my  14 y/o awake when they had school in the morning, struck my dogs twice that I witnessed,  I honestly could keep going on)  She only stayed with us 3 months.  

She has access to Medicaid, subsidized housing, food stamps, the works.  Her living space is atrocious.  DCF is involved.  We go up about once a month to visit.  I usually spend this time cleaning, playing with the grandbaby and we usually take them out to eat.  She usually contacts D at least once a month to help with rent, electric, diapers, etc...We always do because we don't want our grandchild to suffer.  His parents also help with babysitting and transportation as they live across the street and we live 2 hours away.  

She is now pregnant again but by another guy who now does not want to be with her.  Her original BD is willing to raise this child but this is not going to go well with his parents - very traditional.  D and I are trying to ""Prepare for the worst, hope for the best"".  D proposed them coming to live with us again, but I simply cannot implode my life again.  I've countered with D & M live together and we continue dating without living together ourselves but neither one of us is excited about this.  We're also concerned if she loses custody.  We don't think either one of us is up to raising an infant and a toddler again.

During this time one of his most often complaints have been about how I do not ever go grocery shopping (which I think is a total exaggeration). Tbh I do no like to go grocery shopping. I don’t have a bike. I need to walk a km to reach the store and back with heavy bags (we shop only once/twice a week). In my defence, when I do go, I make a list of things I want to cook and get all the items in one go. One the other hand whenever he goes on his bike he ends up grabbing only one or two things (mostly milk and bread coz he can’t live without coffee) and doesn’t plan about other meals. And I am the one who always goes to the farther stores to get specialty item once every couple of weeks. 

Yesterday we had a major fight on other topic. I did not have the energy in me to console or make up with him because I was working from 7 in the morning and had classes to attend. So I just left at 8PM for my Pilates class (which I got late for because we were fighting). When I came back, he was just pissed at me but had cooked food already. We are separately and went to sleep separately.

Today the whole day we haven’t talked much. Just some time ago he came and he told me he was pissed yesterday because I’m so irresponsible. Because I never take care of my meals and he is tired of cooking alone. I just reminded him that I did cook meal just before yesterday (although he was home the whole day and I had to attend 3 classes ending my day at 10.30 PM. I cooked earlier so we can eat on time) and the day before that how we cooked together and I still ended up washing all the dishes. He said he doesn’t want to fight and to let it go.

I do agree I’m not the most conscious person when it comes to meals. I don’t eat breakfast and end up making drink and tea only after he wakes up. Especially since last month I have gotten especially busy and struggling to make meals before 9.30 PM but I don’t mind eating outside when I can’t cook and have offered him the same. Yesterday was also a similar case, where I had a Pilates class till 9 PM.

But I am getting really petty right now because he makes this accusation on me all the time.

Dan and Minnie started talking a few months into him being here and me and all of his other friends warned him that she was toxic and a liar. but he was blinded. Ofc at this point we were all like whatever like you do you. 

UNTIL… Dan drops me a text saying he wants to break up with Minnie but doesn’t wanna hurt her feelings. tbh i didn’t wanna get involved so i just told him to say he wasn’t ready and so on. 

Anyway the next day i get told that he’s talking about her all the time and he’s buying her stuff. so im like okay I’ll ask him what happened. So i do and he starts being rlly weird.

For background: me and minnie have had our past she lied about me and lied to me about multiple things and has done the same things to my friends so i haven’t talked to her in years. but from what i’ve heard from friends she’s still lying and it’s got more serious like very serious. 

anyway he starts sending me weird texts and i’m just saying if ur happy that’s all that matters kind of thing because at this point i’m thinking she’s got his phone or something. Eventually he ends up telling me to die… so yeah.

Well, she got really defensive and accused me of being too controlling and nitpicky. She said I was making a big deal out of nothing and that I shouldn't be bothered by a few dishes in the sink. This led to a bit of an argument, and now she's giving me the silent treatment.

106,1ctg3bh,AITA for wanting more money from selling my mothers in law property?,"Me (28) and my husband (31) back in 2019 after graduating made a deal with his mother that we will live in their small cottage house that they have not used or finished renovations for 15 years. We agreed to live there for 3-5 years, finish the renovations (there was no floors, just unfinished drywall) so it is liveable and nice and then sell the house and split the money evenly. At the same time, there was an opportunity to buy next door property (just land) and we did. We made both properties as one. We invested a LOT of our money as well as a lot of hard work as we taught that will pay back when we will sell both properties as one. In fact, we made it so nice that multiple magazines recognized our garden as inspiring and beautiful!  
Now is the time for selling the property and my mother in law showed her true self. She claims that we should get only 5% of the property value (before us her property was worth maybe 25-30% of todays selling price) and money for our part of the property that we bought ourselves (thats around 15%), so all together around 20% of the entire property value. 

She now says that we did not pay any rent all these years and we should be grateful for letting us live there. If we had to pay rent, we would not have gone there and put in so much work.

This is not the first time she is unethical (she steals from her work, as a nurse she speaks badly about cancer patients, ignores boundaries etc).

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-16,"AITA for wanting more money from selling my mothers in law property? Me (28) and my husband (31) back in 2019 after graduating made a deal with his mother that we will live in their small cottage house that they have not used or finished renovations for 15 years. We agreed to live there for 3-5 years, finish the renovations (there was no floors, just unfinished drywall) so it is liveable and nice and then sell the house and split the money evenly. At the same time, there was an opportunity to buy next door property (just land) and we did. We made both properties as one. We invested a LOT of our money as well as a lot of hard work as we taught that will pay back when we will sell both properties as one. In fact, we made it so nice that multiple magazines recognized our garden as inspiring and beautiful!  
Now is the time for selling the property and my mother in law showed her true self. She claims that we should get only 5% of the property value (before us her property was worth maybe 25-30% of todays selling price) and money for our part of the property that we bought ourselves (thats around 15%), so all together around 20% of the entire property value. 

She now says that we did not pay any rent all these years and we should be grateful for letting us live there. If we had to pay rent, we would not have gone there and put in so much work. We raised the property value 60-70% up! I think that it would fair to receive at least 50% from selling price. She completely ignores the deal we made 5 years back.

My sister still lives at home with me and our parents, and normally they would be the ones to look after Elise when my sister is out but they’re working the week that she’ll be away during so they aren’t an option for during the day. 

My mother came up to me recently and asked how I would feel about looking after Elise for the week during the day until they arrive home from work, and I told her I wouldn’t want to because I have no idea how to look after a toddler and I don’t want to be with her for that length of time. She said that was okay, and didn’t mention anything about it after. 

She must’ve told my sister because she pretty much stormed into my room and asked me why I don’t want to look after Elise. I told her the same thing I told my mother, and she started trying to make me feel bad or something by asking me why I wouldn’t want to spend time with my niece if I love her and stuff like that. I told her I don’t care what she says because I wasn’t doing it and she said I was being selfish by not doing this after everything she’s done for me, and that she’s stuck for a babysitter now because of me. I just told her she should’ve thought about that before she decided to book a vacation, and she left.

Took time off school, figured out what I wanted to do with my life, got into my dream school, and I’m very happy. I met some people within my department my first year (last year) who I became friends with, (fake names) Alice (24Nonbinary, I chose to replace their name with something similar to their real name, think Jen and Jane) and Erin (40F). I joined a club they were already part of that has to do with our shared degree. It was fantastic and we all got along and were happy.

This past semester, we were all executives in the club and starting a new big project for the following year. Tina (23F) was one of the executives. I really like her, she was the first person I met when I got to this school last year and I immediately liked her.

Yet, this last semester she wasn’t doing much in her role as marketing director for our club. We hadn’t done much yet for her to promote this past semester since we were mostly getting things ready for the big project in the fall (we’re media production people). So, I understand Tina didn’t have much to “promote” but we were desperate for writers and other people to join our club and she never came up with ideas or campaigns for anything during the semester. Tina was working more reactively (if our president Erin said we needed an IG post or a poster made, she would get it done and do it well). She also never came to exec meetings and never responded in our Slack chats about the club, it was like Tina wasn’t even in the club anymore. 

I brought all these concerns up to the rest of the exec team at our last exec meeting. No one agreed with me and I was a little surprised. I tried to explain why I thought this, but everyone brushed it off. 

This happened a couple months ago, but yesterday Alice reached out and told me I had been racially biased with my critiques. (Tina is a black woman), since Kaleb also didn’t go to every meeting therefore I was critiquing a black woman and not a “white passing man” Kaleb is N.A. I tried explaining that, while Kaleb missing meetings did upset me, he did his job and did it well, so I couldn’t complain bc we’re busy college students.

Also, Alice didn’t like that I said Tina used Canva to create our posts. I love Canva, but I also know it’s easier to use, which just sent my brain on that tangent and I didn’t mean for it to come off as a critique of her using Canva, more like “yea the posts are done quickly bc she’s using Canva” since her doing quick work was cited as a reason everyone dismissed my concern. But as I said, she did reactive (made posts after being asked) work vs proactive (taking initiative to create things on her own or come up with ideas). I will answer any questions to clarify.

I got it about two weeks ago. As expected, there were a few minor things wrong with it but nothing huge. For context: I drove it eleven hours back home from where I bought it and didn’t encounter any issues along the way. The largest things were 1) it needed some brake work done and 2) the windshield was badly cracked in a few areas. Before I bought it, I asked my girlfriend for her opinion (but not her approval) and she said “if you like it, go for it! It’s cool”. Once I got home, I immediately got the brakes fixed (the now work perfectly) and I got a new windshield, along with other small cosmetic things I’ve already done. Now, two weeks later, she randomly went off on me last night, saying things such as: 

“I really wish you hadn’t bought the truck”

“I wish I had talked you out of it”

“It’s in such bad condition. The brakes don’t work, it has no airbags”

She kept re-using the brake and windshield line over and over, even after me telling her I already got them fixed. She thinks that bc I bought it with bad brakes, that they’re “permanently disabled” and will break again. She also doesn’t like the fact that there are no airbags (it didn’t originally come with airbags). 

Now she wants me to get rid of it, and I’ll do no such thing. I already have a nice car to drive everyday, this is just a second car. I got it so I can have something to wrench on on the weekends.

She also thinks I didn’t have a valid reason to buy it; my philosophy is that you don’t need a reason to buy anything. I bought it bc I wanted it and it makes me happy. 

Context on relationship: dating for one year and three months, but were friends for a while before then. Has always been a strong, healthy relationship, and are considering moving in together later this year.

114,1ctekyl,AITA for leaving after my coworkers started harassing me about getting a partner?,"English is not my first language, so please excuse any grammar mistakes i make.

I (18 f) have been working at my current job for almost a year now. I am a quite reserved person, who does not enjoy sharing things about their personal life at work and this is where the problem lies now. For the past few months my coworkers (who are mostly male but even that few female colleagues i have joined in) have been picking on me about finding a ""nice guy"", getting married and having kids. For context i am on the aroace spectrum and i wish to be child free. At first it started off as teasing, however it quickly turned into an everyday thing. There haven't been any shift where it was not mentioned.
Of course after a while I got fed up so i talked with my coworkers about it, and some of them were understanding and stopped. However most of them weren't, instead they started harassing me more. They even started ""shipping"" me with one of my coworker, saying he is my crush. It is tiring and i feel uncomfortable here. 

But back to the question: we usually go to have a lunch break as a group, since it is easier. Once we sat down to eat today, I quickly texted my mom about my glasses (which I broke beforehand). One of my coworkers saw this as an opportunity and he asked if I was texting my lover, then the other one joined and asked ""which one are you thinking about?"". I told them I still don't have anyone. That's when one of my female colleague chimed in and said ""it's so disappointing"" and I will ""find someone""- then she pointed at my so called ""crush"". I do not wish to find anyone. So I just did what I usually do when I'm fustrated: I left. I got up and left the dining table. Later on they told me i was acting bitchy and that it was rude to leave.

I feel fustrated and sometimes even violated when they harass me. So AITA for leaving?

I (18 f) have been working at my current job for almost a year now. I am a quite reserved person, who does not enjoy sharing things about their personal life at work and this is where the problem lies now. For the past few months my coworkers (who are mostly male but even that few female colleagues i have joined in) have been picking on me about finding a ""nice guy"", getting married and having kids. For context i am on the aroace spectrum and i wish to be child free. At first it started off as teasing, however it quickly turned into an everyday thing. There haven't been any shift where it was not mentioned.
Of course after a while I got fed up so i talked with my coworkers about it, and some of them were understanding and stopped. However most of them weren't, instead they started harassing me more. They even started ""shipping"" me with one of my coworker, saying he is my crush. It is tiring and i feel uncomfortable here. 

But back to the question: we usually go to have a lunch break as a group, since it is easier. Once we sat down to eat today, I quickly texted my mom about my glasses (which I broke beforehand). One of my coworkers saw this as an opportunity and he asked if I was texting my lover, then the other one joined and asked ""which one are you thinking about?"". I told them I still don't have anyone. That's when one of my female colleague chimed in and said ""it's so disappointing"" and I will ""find someone""- then she pointed at my so called ""crush"". I do not wish to find anyone. So I just did what I usually do when I'm fustrated: I left. I got up and left the dining table. Later on they told me i was acting bitchy and that it was rude to leave.

I feel fustrated and sometimes even violated when they harass me. So AITA for leaving? I don't know what I should do.",0.0,-0.014101757667958736,0,1

We started talking about marriage and looking at rings 3 months into our relationship. We knew exactly what we wanted to do and how we wanted to go about it. 

In January of 2024, we started doing some ring shopping (prior to proposal) to see what kind of ring I wanted. I told him my ring size and kind of design I liked so he knew what to look for with me. (Size 7.5, round cut) We made the decision to go to the pawnshop to see what they had and I saw this GORGEOUS rose gold diamond ring for $999! I had been debating between having an emerald stone or a diamond, but seeing this ring made it easy for me to decide! I told him that this was the one.

At the pawnshop, they offered layaway options where you can make payments overtime and I thought that was a good idea for us to afford the ring! After we left, I trusted that he would get the gist of what I wanted and how to get it. I had been talking about it ever since I saw it. 

Fast forward to now, May, he proposed to me with a completely different ring that I didn’t choose or ever show interest in. Although it was an emerald ring, it was a rectangular design. The stone in the ring is green but it is not real emerald. The ring is also 2 sizes bigger than my ring finger(size 9). When he proposed to me, I said yes because I love him and it wasn’t about the ring why I want to marry him. It’s like I was disappointed and grateful at the same time. 

Yesterday, I asked him what happened to the ring we had been talking about from the pawnshop and he told me that he had put it on layaway. But when he broke his hand in April, he was out of work for a while and couldn’t make a payment on it… so he wasn’t able to keep it on layaway. However, he has been back to work a month since then and never went to put it back on layaway. Instead, he bought a completely different ring at full retail price, that can’t fit my finger and I honestly don’t even like it. 

His excuse is that he didn’t want to spend money on layaway because we are in the process of moving. I honestly believe it was just easier for him to get the emerald.

118,1ctdvto,AITA. I didn’t call my mom on Mother’s Day. She called me first and flipped tf out.,"
My wife (54F) and I(52M) moved to a far southern state (US) from a northern state in 2020. Prior to that we would go see my mom on Mother’s Day or any other family holiday every year. Except thanksgiving. Bless her heart but her turkey was like eating an eraser and for 25 years I thought that’s what turkey was supposed to be. My ex-wife and I got her to come to us that day. I digress.

When my now wife and I moved down here it has become a thing that, at the start, we would do zoom calls or FaceTime, or Alexa our family calls. By family calls I mean the big ones; Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving. Any others were phone calls or face times scheduled always after 5:00 because of work and we are active on weekends. In the 4 years we’ve been down here it’s been like that. Family holidays are scheduled and individual holidays are a free for all after 5:00. (We live in the same time zone so that’s not an issue and we’ve made these calls at 7-8.)  

So on Mother’s Day we were invited to a bbq at a work friend’s place where I was the cook. When it comes to bbq I am always the cook but whatever. I had everything planned out to the minute as to how long it would take and have time to call my mom. At 5:10 I had 10 minutes left and I would be done cooking and could slip off someplace quiet to call her when my phone rang. It was her. I stepped into the house because of the chatter outside but answered before I could. She asked what was going on and told her that we were at a friend’s house. She then got pissy and hung up on me before i could explain what was going on. I walked back outside and my wife could see something was wrong. I told her and pretty much everyone within earshot what happened and they were on my side. For them the show went on but for me I was on the fence. I wanted to call her back but she has a history of pulling these stunts and everyone told me to let it go. So I did. She texted me today and said she was hurt because I didn’t call her and she was hurt I didn’t call her back. I texted her back and offered no apology and told her what I was trying to tell her but she wouldn’t listen and hung up on me. I said I’d call her after work today. I did call and she didn’t answer. Where did I go wrong and am I TA?

TL;DR Mom and I have traditional calling times for holidays after 5:00pm but no set times except for the big holidays( Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving.)

120,1ctcw3n,AITA for refusing to bring a kid I am in a show with to rehearsals because his parents don't want to make the drive?,"I'm in a production of Kinky Boots at a theatre about an hour from where I live. Rehearsals start at 6:30, so I have just enough time to get home from work, let the dog out, eat and then I'm off to rehearsal. I was brought in a couple weeks late because a female ensemble member dropped out and the director (who I've worked with before) asked if I would step in. This is community theatre, so I'm not getting paid and am actually losing money because of the long drive (did not know where the theatre was when I said yes), but I committed, so whatever.

For those unfamiliar, Kinky Boots has 2 kids in the show who portray younger versions of the leads. They are only in two songs, the opening and the finale. The week I start rehearsals, I get an email from ""Young Charlie""'s dad asking if I would drive his son to and from rehearsals the days he is called. He said the actress playing ""Lauren"" had been doing it, but she is having to miss a couple weeks of our rehearsals because she is going into tech/shows for another play. In short, Lauren told this father that I would drive his son to rehearsals **without asking me beforehand** if I would be cool with it. If she had, I would have told her no and this all could have been avoided.

The main reason is that I don't particularly like kids and I don't want to spend up to two hours driving back and forth with a 14 YO when I would much rather listen to my music really loud and not feel the need to entertain this particularly chatty kid. Also, I'd have to pick him up/drop him off and change my routine to accommodate this new inconvenience.

And I get it, the parents don't want to drive to this theatre, drop off the kid and then come back to the theatre hours later to pick him up, but they made the decision to let him be in the play, so transportation is their responsibility. Also, we've never met, so why are they blindly trusting me with their child?

Back to the email, the dad asked if I could pick up Charlie from their home outside of downtown and then drop him off. I used this as my excuse, saying their home was out of my way in getting to the theatre and would add on at least 20 minutes to my commute and I was already struggling to get to rehearsals on time, which was kind of true. He responds that he would be happy to drop Charlie off at my home or we could meet somewhere in between. I finally had to be (somewhat) honest and say I wasn't comfortable being responsible for someone else's child and I wouldn't be driving Charlie to rehearsal.

Yesterday, as I was approaching the theatre I see a man I didn't recognize leaving it, so I smile and say hello. He didn't say anything and just stared daggers into me. Turns out that was Charlie's dad and now I'm feeling guilty.

122,1ctcrv2,AITA for banning my to-be-mother in law from the wedding,"I (25M) am going to be marrying my lovely fiance (27F) in 6 months. Let's call her Gabrielle (G). She's fantastic, love her to bits, and am excited as hell for the wedding. Her mother (M) however, is (and this is mutually agreed upon by us), an abuser. For as long as I've known G, every couple of months, they will get into a fight fabricated by M, culminating in M sending vile things to G. I encourage G to stand up for herself, however, she handwaves this abuse (after being incredibly upset for a time of course) since M is the only parent that she has.

Throughout wedding planning, M has flipped between helpful, to toxic. For brevity I'll avoid examples, but this oft has surrounded money, and how she has ""put so much towards the wedding"". But, this has almost always been contingent on doing what M wants with the money; often outside our budget and what we want at the wedding. In most cases though, we just give in. It then gets lorded over us how much she is contributing. Any pushback over ""ideas"" that M has is immediately responded to with a tirade on 'disrespect' and how much she has contributed, how we should be grateful etc. This has mutually annoyed G and I to no end.

It came to a head today. M wanted to pay for a thing she really wanted, but then explicitly said that she wouldn't pay for something else that she wanted and we didn't. G, with my support, presented some pushback, which went down the familiar path of disrespect. However, this time it got vile, personal, and about as abusive as you can get in text format. It was shared with me (by G) and was one of the most disgusting passages of text I've ever read. M said she wasn't going to come to the wedding, and demanded we give back the money she already provided.

My immediate response to G was that I don't want to negotiate with someone playing the emotional blackmail card. She could have the money back and that's that. G tended to agree, saying that if that's what the mother really wanted, she couldn't stop her...

However, M tried to wheel everything back a few hours later, pretending the abuse didn't happen. However, I was done with it at this point. We're this far out from the wedding, her behaviour was spiralling. I have a personal gripe with bullies and abusers, so I was ropeable; Previously I was only hanging on for G's sake. With this, I told G that I wouldn't accept this wheelback from M, and she wasn't to come. She can have her money back, that's that.

G understands where I'm coming from and is accepting of this, however of course is still somewhat upset that it has come to this, and that M, who as said is her only parent, cannot come to the wedding. I refuse however to share a wedding with an out and out abuser who has for years, terrorised G to no end, and bringing no end of strife to the wedding planning process with her consistent emotional abuse of both of us.

It then gets lorded over us how much she is contributing. Any pushback over ""ideas"" that M has is immediately responded to with a tirade on 'disrespect' and how much she has contributed, how we should be grateful etc. This has mutually annoyed G and I to no end.

It came to a head today. M wanted to pay for a thing she really wanted, but then explicitly said that she wouldn't pay for something else that she wanted and we didn't. G, with my support, presented some pushback, which went down the familiar path of disrespect. However, this time it got vile, personal, and about as abusive as you can get in text format. It was shared with me (by G) and was one of the most disgusting passages of text I've ever read. M said she wasn't going to come to the wedding, and demanded we give back the money she already provided.

My immediate response to G was that I don't want to negotiate with someone playing the emotional blackmail card. She could have the money back and that's that. G tended to agree, saying that if that's what the mother really wanted, she couldn't stop her...

However, M tried to wheel everything back a few hours later, pretending the abuse didn't happen. However, I was done with it at this point. We're this far out from the wedding, her behaviour was spiralling. I have a personal gripe with bullies and abusers, so I was ropeable; Previously I was only hanging on for G's sake. With this, I told G that I wouldn't accept this wheelback from M, and she wasn't to come. She can have her money back, that's that.

G understands where I'm coming from and is accepting of this, however of course is still somewhat upset that it has come to this, and that M, who as said is her only parent, cannot come to the wedding. I refuse however to share a wedding with an out and out abuser who has for years, terrorised G to no end, and bringing no end of strife to the wedding planning process with her consistent emotional abuse of both of us.

123,1ctckzg,AITA for giving my friend unfiltered honest advice about her husband after she asked?,"I 32F have been with my husband 29M Jay for 3 years. We have a daughter Annie 1F. For Mother's Day, Jay booked me a weekend trip to spend with my sisters and Mom and he took Annie to visit my MIL. Jay was really thoughtful and booked us all a spa weekend and I posted a selfie of me, my mom and sisters thanking Jay for organising this surprise on my instagram.

I went to lunch my friend Sara 31F who is 4mo pregnant and she asked me about my weekend and mentioned she saw my instagram story. I told her about it and then asked her about her Mother's Day. She started complaining that her husband Dan didn't even offer to look over their 2yo daughter while she cleaned on the sunday.

I sympathised until she made a comment about how I would never understand as Jay is so nice and then said maybe she should have been a cougar like me. I told her that her comment was unfair, and then I asked if she wanted advice, which she agreed to, so I told her if she was really that upset over how Dan treated her she wouldn't have got pregnant a second time and instead demanded for Dan to treat her better.

Sara has been friends with me since before I dated Jay, where she saw me dated guys that didn't treat me as well, and I told her that, saying I set expectations and that is how I got a husband that treated me well and learnt to not lower my standards.

She is now going around to our mutual friends saying I insulted her husband. I will admit I got upset at her comments and I maybe could have phrased it more delicately, but she asked for my advice, and I gave it.

Wife always thinks we're poor - we are not rich but not poor either and certainly have disposable income for this purpose. 

My wife wants to do some fitness training on the q3. She honestly rarely uses it but does like to every now and then.  I wear glasses and so I have lenses installed and a halo strap (BoboVR S3) and it's all set up for my head etc. My own sweat too and all that. I also don't use a facial interface as no real need with halo strap - as I often play in the dark using IR blaster for tracking.

To get it ready for her use, I have to revert everything back to stock, take of lenses, change strap and put on a facial interface which she then sweats into etc.  

I have suggested we get her her own headset so it can be set up in her name, her strap, her settings, and all that.  Cue her flying into anger that she doesn't use it enough to warrant her own, that it's no big deal if we share it and that it's ours to use together.

I tried to point out that we don't use it together because it's a one-person device primarily and it would give you more opportunities to do her fitness programs if it was ready to go each time specifically for her.  Plus we could do some co-op games together, even some fitness ones. Seems like a no brainer to me.  I said we don't share phones or PCs so why share a VR headset when we didn't have to.

But she just got angry at me instead and said I ruined her chance to use it as she was now too angry (thought that would be a great time to use it tbh. Full force in Thrill Of The Fight!).

My middle name is Sinéad. My ILs struggled badly with my name when we met despite constant corrections. They default to Sierra. My SIL made some ignorant comments about being in America and so embracing the Sierra pronunciation instead of my weird one. Or she suggested I use the same spelling as Keira Knightley.

I accept sometimes they slip on my name and default to what most people do over here. So I offered to let them use my middle name.

128,1ctbojl,AITA : for not putting my group mates names on the project and causing them to fail the class?,"i (19m) was assigned by the professor to a random group which had 4 other students. we were assigned a project where we had to make a diagnosis and treatment plan for a case that will be selected by the professor for each group. it was for 40% of the total grade then we had to present it. 

the professor gave us the case and i was just praying that we got one of the easier cases. we were assigned a case for a child that had a neurological disorder. it was the HARDEST case of all of the possible ones that you could get, but i was like its okay we can still research and ask the professors etc. 

i asked them when can we meet to start working on the project many times and every time they just leave me on read or reply with we’re busy. i stopped asking them but would send them updates whenever i do something for the project (and btw i had to go to multiple hospitals/physicians and ask them for data about this project it was very time consuming and not easy at all to do alone especially as a person who has social anxiety)

i asked one of them after class on how far was he in the project he said that he didn’t even start working on it he had other stuff to worry about.

So i just waited until a week before the deadline and asked them that we need to practice for the presentation and they should email me what they wrote so i can put it all together. AND ALL 4 OF THEM RESPONDED WITH SOME SORT OF VERSION OF THIS “sorry we cant do anything because the case is too hard please do my part since you understand about the case more than we do” and that was the last straw for me i was already extremely stressed with alot happening in my personal life but also i had a ton of work and other projects. 

I didn’t respond to any of their texts and just did the whole project myself since i already have done all the research and gathered everything i needed. I didn’t put their names on it because that was a requirement that you need to submit the names of each member of the group and i emailed the professor about the whole situation. 

On presentation day, 3 out of 4 members of my group were present. the professor said “this group only has one student come up and present”. one of them said to the professor that we are actually 5 but one is absent. the professor said “only one student did the work so only he can present” 

They were all FUMING. But it was genuinely one of the best presentations ive ever did i got a full mark and the professor said that she was very pleased with my presentation and project and she is very proud that i am one of her students.

I called the father and asked if he knew about the video, he confirmed and said it was something silly that they had come up with and he agreed. 

I said that I didn't feel comfortable knowing that there was a video with more than 2 million views with my daughter without me knowing and my consent.

She asked if I was serious and when I confirmed, she said it was something my daughter had asked her to do together and her father knew that, besides being something silly and they didn't need my permission to do everyyhing with my daughter.

A few weeks ago I got a message from Adam's highschool girlfriend Dana to tell me that they had hooked up a few weeks ago and she was sorry as she didn't realise he wasn't single. I thanked her for letting me know, but I wasn't actually upset. Me and Adam have drifted since we decided to be long distnace last year, and I knew I couldn't move past this and I was going to break up with Adam after he cheated.

I am very close to Adam's sister Fran 24F and see her as my little sister. Fran is was having a destination wedding abroad and she asked me to be a bridesmaid. She got married a few weeks after I found out about Dana, and I decided to keep quiet as I didn't want to take any attention away from Fran and her big moment. I drifted from Adam, and he hadn't even realised until the actual wedding week when we flew in for the wedding and we spent time together. 

I managed to avoid him by saying I had bridesmaid duties and since Adam's family covered my plane tickets and the hotel, I was able to spend more on shopping and seeing attractions and had fun. 

After the wedding, I broke up with Adam and told him I knew about Dana and he was upset and begged me to stay. I said no and left.

She and Adam have accused me of using her family for a free vacation as she spoke to Adam who told her how I avoided him during the trip and I am not sure if I am in the wrong and should apologise.

She and Adam have accused me of using her family for a free vacation as she spoke to Adam who told her how I avoided him during the trip and I am not sure if I am in the wrong and should apologise.

  
Adam's family are the closest thing to my family and when we initially broke up I told Adam I wanted to be civil as I love his family and he agreed to tell them we split mutually, I am scared that Adam and Fran telling their family I knew about the affair will mean I lose their support too.

I rent out rooms in my home and each room ranges to $800-1000$ depending on size, whether it’s a private bathroom and all our rooms come furnished with tv, bedding and walk in closet. I have a tenant living upstairs while my wife and I live downstairs. 

I have rules in my home and I’d like for them to be abided by. No talking on the phone past 11pm, and it’s not a rule, but I want windows closed at night as the air is very cold and I don’t want the pipes to freeze into the next room. Especially if she isn’t here, if she’s at work. 

Lastnight, my tenant left her window open, she does it maybe twice a month but lastnight it started raining. So, I put the code into her door and I unlocked it, and I closed her window and locked it back. While there, I noticed her closet was empty. Her clothes were usually hanging out they were all packed up. Was she going to leave and not give me 30 days notice. I am quite sensitive, so I got upset. I’ve had this happen before and it’s not considerate. While in her room I also viewed how she lived. Her room was dirty and she had several urine bottles inside of her room which was disgusting.

134,1ctay0r,AITA for asking money to my childhood friend because it is been a couple of years since she owed me?,"I’ve been best friends with someone since 6th grade, and we were very close until early 2024. Here’s some background: During the pandemic in 2021, while under ECQ, I had a side hustle and received financial support from online friends to help with my college expenses. I shared my problems with these friends, which included research costs and daily school expenses. I graduated with a degree in Hospitality Management, which involved a lot of cooking and drink preparation, all done online during the pandemic.

I told my best friend about my job and the generous support from my online friends. Sometimes I mentioned buying things I wanted, like clothes and shoes. One day, she told me she was going to inherit money from her late aunt but needed to process it. She hinted that she wanted the things I was buying, so I felt sorry for her and believed she would inherit the money. I ended up buying her things, thinking she would repay me once she got her inheritance.

In September 2022, she hinted again that she needed money to go to the city to claim her inheritance. When I asked how much, she said “a thousand.” I lent her the money, and we agreed she would repay me with interest once she got the inheritance. By December 2022, she hadn’t received the money because her aunt hadn’t updated the beneficiary, so it went to her cousins instead.

In March 2023, she was worried about her research project. She was an IT student about to graduate and needed to pay for code contributions from her classmates and an IT professional. She hinted again that she needed money, and I lent her another 1k, with the promise of repayment within a week. However, weeks turned into months, and by January 2024, she still hadn’t repaid me. When I asked for the money, she became cold and rude, claiming she didn’t have a job.

Her boyfriend got involved, blaming me for lending her the money. He sarcastically asked how much I wanted, so I said “50k for your girlfriend’s inconvenience and I’ll shut up.” He mocked me, saying he’d rather lose the money in a cockfight. I called him out on his claims of being a millionaire. My ex-friend then tried to guilt-trip me, saying she was pregnant and I was making her suffer because of her debt. I told her I only wanted my money back with interest.

She has barely messaged me since, seemingly trying to avoid repaying her debt.

Usually, I tip more behind their backs in cash or if I’m paying I will give them 15 and then my Dad gives them some cash. Well, my parents caught on to this.

My Father was only tipping 40 dollars for a table of 7 where some of us are a little demanding. The restaurant also gave me a free dessert. I waited until they left the restaurant to tip another 20 dollars. (I should have given her more now that I think about it.)

After I came out, my Father called me out and got upset that I tipped more money. I told him that some of us are not cheapskates. Well, obviously he got a knot in his face about me calling him that.

136,1ctam66,AITA for blowing up after husband who doesn’t cook for us ate my leftover pizza?,"Yesterday I (27f) got upset because I had pizza leftover for myself in the fridge that husband (32m) ate after he said he didn’t want any when I went and got it. We argued  while I passive aggressively cooked myself another meal. 

For context, we’ve been having a lot of issues, one being “dinners”. 

I did and still do a lot of the cooking and grocery shopping for us. In the past, I’ve asked why he can’t shop, cook for us more, help me cook, or at least do the dishes when I cook. He says that he doesn’t care about eating dinner and would like to eat less because he’s obese, so I should cook for myself and not expect him to cook or dishwash. 

I want to clarify that he is not obese because of my cooking. I cook well-balanced healthy dinners. He gets pizza or fast food almost everyday and has a sweet tooth. Of course, at first I wanted to help him be more healthy, so I started cooking for myself and getting groceries just for myself. 

But then he started eating my snacks, the dinners I cooked and my leftovers. He’d get hungry because he didn’t have dinner (you dont say??) and would eat a box of cheez its late at night. I get sensitive when he doesn’t leave any snacks or food left for me, but he says it’s shitty that I complain about him eating food that’s available because “we can literally just get more”. I’m pretty generous with sharing self-designated food, all I ask is that he leaves me some and ask me ahead of time. He does neither. 

Yesterday I complained that not only did my leftovers disappear, but now I have to cook for myself AND for the person who ate it and who doesn’t pitch in. He says that I had a valid argument; that he should cook more. But apparently that argument has been watered down by me selfishly complaining that he ate my pizza because “Again, we can literally get more pizza”. I said the arguments are related — you should cook more OR not eat my pizza when you don’t cook.

Am I wrong to give him shit about eating my pizza or food in general? In this context, AITA? 

EDIT: Corrected to (32m). 

I am most definitely getting a lockbox for my snacks and labeling my leftovers with DO NOT EAT and while I’m at it I will also stop doing his laundry. I’ve just been too nice. I take care of our cats and he feeds them sometimes because according to him “he didn’t want cats in the first place”. We’ve been talking about divorce at only 3.5 years of marriage but will try counselling first. Thank you to everyone except the barista guy.

137,1ctaf5z,AITA for not allowing my dad his requests for my wedding?,"I (27F) have been dating my boyfriend (33M) for just under a year. I’ve made a new account for this post because people involved know my main account.

We’ve discussed the future and agreed that if things go well, we think after one and a half or two years of dating would be a good time to get engaged, with a view to getting married in about five years. This would give us time to save up for an engagement and wedding, and make sure we’re both in jobs that allow us to take enough time off. To be clear - we are not engaged. We have just agreed that we’d like to be and begun talking about what this would all look like. These are important details and I wouldn’t want to enter into an engagement without discussing what marriage itself would look like - we have spent a long time discussing our expectations and hopes, which happily align well.

Enter my family. I mentioned this to my parents as I was very happy things are going well. They now bring it up every time I see them. My father (60M) has demanded that my boyfriend call him for permission, that he walks me down the aisle and makes a speech at my wedding. We are not a traditional or religious family and while he did call my mum’s (59F) father for permission, no one asked him to and they found it old fashioned.

My father and I have never got along. We have a really bad history and I don’t enjoy seeing him. I only still have contact because he’s married to my mother. He was really abusive growing up and I have done a lot of work in therapy to overcome this as an adult.

I told him in no uncertain terms that I find his demands ridiculous and will not be happening. The only permission needed is mine and my boyfriend’s. I don’t want him walking me down the aisle or making a big speech. I also find it wild that I’m not even engaged and before even congratulating me or talking to me about this potential big step, the whole conversation has become about him. Every time I see him he will shout at me and berate me over this until I leave.

He said if he doesn’t get to do these things, there’s no point him or my mother coming to my wedding. I was enraged as currently there is not even an engagement and he’s issuing ultimatums and toddler tantrums. I said all of this to him. I also said if he doesn’t want to come unless he gets things his way, don’t bother coming. I just want people there who are happy for me and my boyfriend, and support us.

My brother (25M) says I was too harsh with him, that I should be more understanding of his wish to be involved, and that I’m overreacting.

He also says I’ve caused my mother to be upset thinking she might not to get to come because of my stubbornness. I feel very angry, but now I want to check AITA?

138,1ctacdq,"AITA for not telling my mom that I am in heart failure tw: medical issues, verbal abuse, homophobia (crosspost, but my own story)","hey everyone, after the conversation I had with my brother I would like some input because I don't know how to feel anymore.

Backstory: I (f20) was born with a rare heart condition that caused me to grow up in and out of hospitals. My family was also all born in South America, except for me. Being born with this problem caused my family's U.S. vacation to turn into a 20-year (and counting)long stay. My culture is very conservative and women are held to an incredibly high beauty standard. Due to this, my mom (f62) has not always been the nicest to me, to put it lightly, which has led me to be in low contact with her for about 6 years now (she moved back to our country of origin after her and my dad divorced 16 years ago).

Onto the story: about a month and a half ago I was rushed to the hospital and ended up being diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Now I'm not going to lie, I am terrified. I told my dad right away but I am also low-contact/no-contact with my two siblings (m 36 & m 26) due to abuse and mistreatment. So last week I told M36 over text and he called me. We talked for about 40 minutes and he tried to convince me to tell Mom what was happening. Telling me that I will regret being LC with her and that whatever she has said or done in the past that has hurt me I have to forgive her and give her some grace because of the cultural differences and that she is ""from another time"" (called me satan when I came out, made fun of me and my body for any ""imperfections"", said my only worth is my U.S citizenship, etc) but that at the end of the day she is still my mom. He also went on about how I will ""regret treating her this way"" and how I need to stop being stubborn and allow her to be part of my life again.

I told him he is free to tell her because I lack the language skills to communicate such a serious issue to her in our native language, but that until she loves and accepts me for who I am, I will remain LC with her. He also went on about how I can't be so strict and expect everyone in my life to agree with my ""lifestyle"" I just need to learn how to brush that aside and not talk about it.

ETA: So AITA for not telling my mom directly that I am in heart failure?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-16,"AITA for not telling my mom that I am in heart failure tw: medical issues, verbal abuse, homophobia (crosspost, but my own story) hey everyone, after the conversation I had with my brother I would like some input because I don't know how to feel anymore.

Backstory: I (f20) was born with a rare heart condition that caused me to grow up in and out of hospitals. My family was also all born in South America, except for me. Being born with this problem caused my family's U.S. vacation to turn into a 20-year (and counting)long stay. My culture is very conservative and women are held to an incredibly high beauty standard. Due to this, my mom (f62) has not always been the nicest to me, to put it lightly, which has led me to be in low contact with her for about 6 years now (she moved back to our country of origin after her and my dad divorced 16 years ago).

Onto the story: about a month and a half ago I was rushed to the hospital and ended up being diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Now I'm not going to lie, I am terrified. I told my dad right away but I am also low-contact/no-contact with my two siblings (m 36 & m 26) due to abuse and mistreatment. So last week I told M36 over text and he called me.

139,1cta9ue,AITAH for giving her shit for wanting me to wear a different bag?,"So one of my(20F) best friends (18F) like to go out partying together. She's single and I'm in a relationship with another woman. She wants to talk to guys but I personally get really uncomfortable when guys talk to me, I just want to be left alone to dance and enjoy my night. Of course I don't blame men for talking to me, since I'm here without a partner and for all they know I'm straight. 


So to resolve this issue I decided to wear a certain bag. It's the Flying Tiger rainbow tote that I see everywhere. I liked the colours and design, and such a colourful bag looks amazing with the black outfits I often wear. So I got the bag, wore it to some clubs and there was no problem. 



Until one day my friend says she has an issue with that bag. She said that she heard people yell ""homo"" at me. I'm usually one to notice sounds the others I'm with don't hear so I was surprised I never heard that being yelled at me. She's saying she's afraid to get hate crimed because I wear this rainbow flag and that makes her uncomfortable. I said to her ""Are you sure it's not just because it ruins your game"", cause if that was the case, no issue at all. She goes out to talk to guys and that bag ruins the whole point of going out. She said ""I mean yeah that too haha"". I let it be for a bit and just brought a black tote. But thinking about it made me feel a bit weird. I know it's not the most subtle rainbow, but she is getting in the way of me expressing my pride and partying comfortably. And it's based on an fear of getting hatecrimed, which is really rare in my country, especially in my city, where crime rates are incredibly low.


 So the next day I texted her that I think it's really weird how I should hide my sexuality because she is uncomfortable of living through just a slither of the homophobia I face on a daily basis when I'm with my girlfriend. In response she said something along the lines of ""but I'm uncomfortable and scared is that not reason enough"" which is kinda fair I guess? Still, I feel like it's either homophobia lite or just what is in her eyes a better reason to not wear that bag to perserve her game.


And of course I could bring my girlfriend but that's not a good idea for two reasons: my girlfriend currently lives abroad for a while with her parents because of financial reasons, and my friend doesn't like my girlfriend (not without a reason might I add)


I'm not gonna wear that bag again because I think it's gonna cause unneeded problems in our friendship if I do, but I also just wanna know if I'm an asshole for giving her shit for not wanting me to wear it.

140,1ct9s3i,AITA for wanting an apology from my bf for his lack of communication,"It was my (f41) birthday yesterday and my bf (m41) was due to come over in the evening with his young daughters to do the birthday cake with my friends. Literally blow out the candles, cut the cake, everyone goes home. It’s a Wednesday so not a big party or anything.

Background: Usually on a Wednesday my bfs parents collect his daughters from school at 3.30pm and take them home to his, feed them dinner and wait for him to get home from work between 5.30 and 6pm, depending on when he left work and traffic. He lives a 5min drive away from me. I wasn’t expecting to see him because usually I’d only see him on a Wednesday if I go to his but he informed me he would be coming to mine as it was my birthday. 

At 4:50pm my bf called me, from his car, to say he’d got out a bit early, was collecting his girls and be with me asap. This journey was 30-40min depending on traffic. My friends arrive at 5:20pm and we await my bfs arrival.

I chase my bf for where he’s at at 6:10pm and he responds at 6:20pm telling me his mother had taken his daughters out for dinner and he’ll be as quick as he can. It is at this point I realise he went out for dinner with his mother and hasn’t had the decency to tell me that he was going to be late. My children and I hadn’t eaten as yet because we didn’t want to sit and eat and have everyone watching us. So I ordered a takeout and went to collect it. He arrived to mine at 6:45pm and I arrived back with food shortly after that. 

AITA for being upset and expecting an apology because either he lied to me, when he said that he was collecting his daughters and coming straight to me, or, if he was unaware of his mothers plans to eat out at that time, for his lack of communication and failure to inform me that he was eating before coming to mine and so wasn’t coming straight to mine as he’d said? 

He thinks I have no right to be upset because he didn’t specifically give a time for when he would be there.

ETA: He wasn’t due to eat with us. He was only going to pop in and be at mine for 20min, on his way home after collecting his girls, so everyone could sing happy birthday and watch me blow out some candles. I actually didn’t expect to see him until the next evening, as Wednesday’s are a bit manic, and it was him that insisted he was going to pop in.

My husband has a history of drug abuse prior to us meeting and went to rehab multiple times about 8 years before we met. When we met, he was only drinking and smoking weed. He had to tone down the weed because he gets drug tested at work but continued to drink. He would still push it and one time couldn’t get a job he needed because he smoked so there’s a pattern of it seeming like he can’t help himself.

After some really bad alcohol-induced fights and him being mean while drunk, he eventually cut back even though to me I’d rather him be sober. He would still sneak more alcohol and say I was in the wrong for judging him drinking beer after work to decompress. Finally I gave in and said I preferred him smoking because it doesn’t make him mean. Once again, he has pushed my boundaries.

He’s been taking cash out of our joint account (we’re married) and I obviously got sus but he denied doing anything wrong. This morning WHILE he was getting ready for work, I walked in to the bathroom while he had a dab rig and wax out. He has specifically told me many times how much wax messed him up in the past and how bad it is.

I know he’d obviously be pissed and we need to have a conversation regardless but WIBTA for throwing it away?

Now she’s officially confirmed she’s her bff but ik that if I didn’t want my bff to hang out with someone she would do it anyway so why is it different.

146,1ct8ldt,AITA for refusing to become my cousins maid of honor?,"So my(21F) cousin(29F) is getting married in a month or so and all this time she had her best friend as her maid of honor but her best friend got sent on a business trip last week and cannot attend her wedding. She gave the best friend her blessing bc this trip will land her a promotion.
    
After this development she asked me to be her maid of honor because I was the most ""presentable"" (she did this right next to my elder sister whom I'm very protective of so I was already annoyed) and I asked what that means, like what would I be responsible for? She listed some basic MOH things, but then she said that I'd have to go to the city the wedding is happening a week before the wedding and stay there. 

The thing is, I'm a college student and I have a super important exam that week. I can attend the wedding but I can't go there a week earlier. I told her this and she told me to just not enter the exam. I said I would fail if I didn't and she said that even if I failed I could just re-take the course next year, but she has only 1 wedding. I explained to her that my university charges tuition per course, so retaking the course would cost an extra 30.000₺, which my family did not have since my mother is retired and my dad has passed away. She said to just tell my mother to get a loan. We argued a little more until my elder sister and I had to leave and the topic is just kind of hanging there rn.

I don't want to miss the exam and fail, but she is talking behind my back to every single family member that will listen to her, calling me a traitor because I refused to support a family member in her time of need and many of our relatives have called me saying that I should accept the MOH position because it is my duty as family.

147,1ct8l3l,AITA for constantly pestering my friend to buy me a new keyboard after he broke it months ago.,"So around autumn last year my friend (M22) and I (M19) were at my house watching a movie. We got hungry and cooked up some ramen and brought it back to my room where we were watching the film. He ends up spilling his ramen on my keyboard (K95 plat xt) and I freak out because it was given to me as a gift (from another friend) and I hadn't even had it for one year. We amicably agree that he'd get me a replacement and continue on with the film. After a month he gets me a used replacement, mind you a normal k95 plat not the XT and I relunctly accept it. 

When I took it home I noticed that a few (around 15 keys) had RGB defects because the previous owner most likely had them set to white or blue which uses up the blue in the RGB and wears down the RGB faster. My friend tries to return the board but gets rejected from eBay either because he waited too long to return it ( I had returned it to him a few days after I noticed the defect so not my problem) or because eBay didn't find that reason enough for a return. Anyway he ends up keeping the defective board for himself as an upgrade. 

So skip forward another month or so and he gets me another used replacement that ended up having another defect. This time the space bar stabilizer was  defective and wouldn't hold the cap on at all. Mind you other caps were loose too. He returned it successfully and after another month of so of waiting bought me another (3rd) used replacement again with the exact same issue. This was returned and brings us to the present. I have been pestering him to buy me a the exact model that be broke, the XT, but he refuses because the only difference is the key caps. I understand this and don't really care because I'm designing my own custom caps anyway. But I argue that he should still buy me a new k95 because not only have we had 3 defective boards sent to us, but also buying without warranty on something like a keyboard scares me. 

This is because once the return window expires you're essentially at the mercy of the life of the board. It could last a long normal life, or it could become defective with the RGB, or with some keys just dying , who knows. I dont want to have a board like that especially because the one he broke I took care of really well and was like-new. Anyway, this has been on the back of my mind so I finally plead my case to him yesterday about why I want a new keyboard instead of a used one and he just tells me ""I don't have that much money or a job right now and I have to pay rent over the summer"" Keep in mind he had more than half a year to come up with the money for a replacement without having to pay any rent whatsoever.

149,1ct88ly,WIBTA for demanding my money back from my landlord?,"So, here's the situation :  


I've been renting an apartment for over a year, and everything was smooth sailing, the relation with the landlord was great until it became tense when she asked me to vacate the place, giving me a mere three months to find a new spot. The thing is that i found it in only a month so she was not happy saying goodbye to 2 months of rent.  
To get back to me she claimed that the microwave wasn't functioning (which I'm certain is not true) and slapped me with a hefty 200 euro charge for a model she found online, which was completely wrong. I was confident about the model of microwave in the apartment, which was only valued at 100 euros.

But here's where it gets tricky. There's a rental law in Paris that regulates the prices, and it turns out she was overcharging me by almost 400 euros per month! That adds up to thousands of euros in overpayments. Legally, I could demand she reimburse me for all that extra cash.

she's already in a tight spot financially and expecting a baby that's why she took the appartement back, plus, she's undertaking major renovations in the apartment.   
Am I being a total asshole for considering asking for my money back, given her circumstances?

150,1ct8420,AITA For Telling My Parents They Have to Adjust Their Expectations,"I (29F) am disabled. I have a genetic condition that causes neuropathy which means I am in pain constantly and am very fatigued quite easily. I was finally diagnosed 4 years ago. 

I am completely independent from my parents and have been since I was a teenager. I own my house, pay all my bills, and am getting married here in a few weeks. I work full time. As far as I am concerned, I’m doing all of the “expected” things in life even though I am disabled and it certainly hasn’t been easy. I’m making it work for me and my partner. 

My parents live in a different state from me and came to help with last wedding details. While here, they kept commenting on things that didn’t live up to their “expectations” for me. 

Some examples include:

1. My house is a little messy. Not dirty, mind you. Just messy. We have a ton of boxes in the garage that we need to bring to the recycling plant, we have a table that tends to collect clutter, my office regularly looks like a hurricane hit a stack of papers. 

My response: I get fatigued extremely easily. Cleaning can take me out of commission for a full day. My partner does a wonderful job of stepping up but also works a demanding job. 

2. We are having a very small wedding (less than 50) and they can’t understand why I’m not inviting all of my aunts and uncles and cousins. 

I am sad we won’t do a huge blow out but we just can’t consider spending the money when I have some medical debt from trying treatments not covered by insurance, surgeries, etc. I asked my parents for help with this and they were not willing to but they are willing to gift money towards the wedding. Priorities seem a little off to me but I digress. 

3. I mentioned that we will NOT be having kids. This one made my mom cry about how she’d never get the chance to experience the birth of her grandchild (I have an older brother who has a kid so I think she was lamenting that my sister in law didn’t let her in the room while my niece was born? And would expect me to have her there which I never would even consider it anyway). I told her I have a genetic condition that I would NEVER consider risking passing down to a child. Plus I am disabled. I wouldn’t be able to pick up or hold my child for very long and being pregnant would be a risk for me. 


There were more little jabs throughout their visit and towards the end I got fed up and told them that they need to adjust their expectations for having a healthy kid because I am not healthy. This sent my mom into hysterical crying and my dad ranted about how I was just lazy and didn’t want to do anything hard and was using it as an excuse. 

I can’t help but wonder if they have a point in any of this and if I’m an ah for snapping. I think I’m doing fine with the life I have but it stings a little to be told I’m not living up to my parents’ expectations. 


SMALL UPDATE:

I had planned on replying to things over my lunch break but was overwhelmed and so touched that I figured I’d do a small update instead. 

First, thank you all. Sometimes it’s hard to see beyond the criticisms of those who should love you unconditionally and in all your stages of life. 

Secondly, my partner and I have had our marriage application done and just waiting to be signed at our wedding. Instead, we are going to meet a judge in a park and get married with a couple of our closest friends and best supporters tomorrow! We haven’t decided what to do about the ceremony that is planned for next month but this way, no matter what, no one can ruin our wedding day and it will be what we want it to be.

My event runner role opened up because the company started hiring an events supervisor. The woman who previously had my job (Kelly, 37 F) is now in the supervisor role.

She was dizzy and struggling to balance herself and walk, slow speech etc. That night the emergency dept said she’d had a stroke, and was transferred to an acute ward at the hospital.

As I knew I had to help manage the event, I went to the venue the next morning with 3 hours sleep and terrified I might lose my sister. I was worried work would be angry if I let them down.

Kelly and our main boss asked how my sister was doing, and I told them what had happened. Kelly has been awful with me since. 

I asked how long the ‘clean up’ after the event had taken in previous years, and she said “It will be done when it’s done, we all want to go out”. She was going to an afterparty, I was going to see my sick sister.

I stayed on regardless and I cleared the majority of the site, and she was still angry with me when I said I had to go at 5pm (I worked the full day with no lunch break, she didn’t help to ease the pressure at all despite the supposed shared responsibility).

I went into work yesterday and we’re now organising a new event. I asked Kelly what my responsibilities would be on the day.
(These events are attended by 10,000+ people, it’s a complex process, and I have no prior experience).
She snapped at me, told me to stop asking her questions and said I “never use my initiative”. Another colleague overheard this and told me I should speak to my boss, which I plan on doing when things have settled with my family.
I left at midday to work remotely, and cried on the bus home.

She has made nasty comments about me being 5 minutes late back from lunch when she arrives in office 2 hours late, and has previously got angry at me for ‘walking too loud’. I feel like I’m being bullied and don’t understand why. I work hard and get my work done to a high standard.

Now my grandfather has also been rushed to hospital with a heart attack. I don’t know what to do. 

AITA if I take the time off work during a busy period, to support my family and because of my colleagues behaviour?

",TL;DR,2024-05-16,"AITA if I take the time off work during a busy period, to support my family and because of my colleagues behaviour? I (23 F) have worked for an events management company for the last 9 months.
My event runner role opened up because the company started hiring an events supervisor. The woman who previously had my job (Kelly, 37 F) is now in the supervisor role.

About 2 months into my job, Kelly started making nasty comments and getting angry at me over seemingly nothing. Recently, it’s escalated.

I have spent the last 4 months organising a big event, this includes booking acts, booking the venue, scheduling the day, finding volunteers, receiving invoices etc.

It is my first time doing anything like this, and the event was set to be a success.

The day before the event, as we were finishing setting up, I got a call to say my sister (who has previously had a brain aneurysm) was being rushed to the emergency department. My colleague Kelly told me not to worry as it’s probably just a precaution.

154,1ct7nsz,AITA for finishing a book my best friend asked me not to finish before her?,"Yeah this sounds ridiculous and it cost me my friendship of 2 years.

Basically, I'm an avid reader. I read whenever & wherever I possibly can. While outside, on the train, at Uni, during lunch, before bed, you name it. Ever since I became friends with Evie 21F, I introduced her to reading and she's also been into reading ever since.
However, she's very moody and insists she can't read unless she's in the right mood, which comes around once every 5 months or so. And lasts for a week. (Not my problem, never really cared tbh)

However, I recently picked up a series she recommended to me. I instantly fell in love, got all the books (a couple thousand pages in total) and started reading. It took me around 2 weeks to get to the final book. It was extremely interesting, and the last book in particular was extremely intense, a huge battle was happening and the ending was finalized only in the last chapter. When I reached it, I texted Evie and told her how excited I was to finish it, and she went off.

Basically, she picked up the book the previous year, and she never got around to finishing it. She had about two chapters left, (so less than 200 pages in total of the series) and she said I couldn't finish mine until she finished hers, saying it was the least I could do, to be respectful of her and her situation of not being able to finish a series she recommended to me.

I scoffed and just ended the conversation and went back to my book. I didn't tell her I finished it, but I posted a review on an app and she saw it. She hasn't talked to me since. Thinking back, I feel bad for upsetting her, but I also stand firm on my opinion that I shouldn't have to put off something I love until someone else is in the ""mood"" to do so before me. does this make me the AH?

155,1ct6mqq,WIBTA if I didn’t go to this wedding?,"So my (28F) partner(43M) was previously married. Now one of his kids (19M) from his first marriage is just getting engaged. The first thing out of his mouth when he tells me the news is that his son asked that I not be invited to the engagement party because he's worried about how his mom will react to seeing me there.

For context, I have a good relationship with both his kids (or do I thought until now) but I've never met the ex-wife. He was divorced by the time we met but the way their marriage ended was less than amicable. On top of that she has some mental health problems and is a bit of a drama queen from what they've all told me. I think the request came from a considerate place of the kid wanting as little drama as possible and for the focus to be on the engagement. Which is fair enough and while I was a little hurt I shrugged and said fine that's not a problem.
I'm a doctor and very busy and am not particularly fussed about going to a party.
But then my partner started to make a big deal about it and how he wanted me to be there and how he bet that Her new partner would be there and if that was the case he'd just leave. Which baffled me because I've never seen him act that petty (and it wasn't exactly like he was defending me - this was all about him). I told him to chill and that it really wasn't a big deal.

Fast forward a few days later and this is obviously still on his mind and he randomly brings it up that I should be mentally prepared to be seated somewhere away from him and his ex-wife and the family table for the actual wedding. Now I didn't want to be thinking about this particular non-issue right then. I'd just finished a long shift and was pretty ready to go to bed. So l was pretty short with him and said coldly that if that's the case then it's fine but I don't particularly feel like attending the wedding and being relegated to a table where I don't know anyone. I told him that if I'm going l'd really prefer to sit with him, cuz you know he's my partner. I said fine I don't need to go to the wedding either.

He then got upset at the thought of me not coming and has been trying to convince me to go but l've just said I don't want to cause any drama and to please not make a big deal about it and that we'll just say I have work stuff that I can't get out of and leave it at that. Partner is now super upset with me.

The whole thing is just upsetting because clearly the kids don't like me as much as I thought if his son has brought this up to him.
Or it's all about the ex-wife's sensitivities.

I've been doing some self reflection and worry I'm the AH because it's the seating scenario that caused me to say I won’t go. Is it normal to seat second spouses somewhere far away from the rest of the family? Am I being unreasonable not wanting to deal with any of this drama?

156,1ct6m6z,AITA for telling my mom she can’t marry her boyfriend?,"My mom is 67 and has had various bfs since her and my father divorced 25yrs ago. Her bfs have always been a little bit odd. My mom is very codependent and will stick with something even when its not working.

This bf, she has been dating for five years. When they met, he first gave me the ick because my mom was not interested in him and he wouldn’t give up on pursuing her. The way he won her over is by contacting a mutual friend of theirs and convincing that friend to pressure my mom into going out with him.

At that time, he drank a lot and was very obnoxious always needing to be the center of attention and talking over everyone. I initially assumed his personality defects were largely from alcohol consumption, and anxiety and insecurity from being very overweight. My mom was able to convince him over the last few years to join a diet program which he was very successful on and to quit drinking after a DWI. This is all great however, his personality defects have only seemed to grow stronger with time. In addition to being self-centered, loud, obnoxious and a know it all, his problems with anxiety and OCD have only gotten worse overtime. He lives with her and seems to have complete control over her house hold and what happens there.

I appreciate that he helps her with cleaning and chores at home but he contributes and no way financially to her mortgage or bills. He works for himself selling insurance and seems to be not super successful but also has no strong drive to be. My mom who has been wanting to retire has not been able to because she is seemingly supporting him and has been trying to work overtime to fix his business problems. 

When she has had health issues he goes in to complete denial that anything is wrong with her in a very aggressive way. Arguing at the hospital when she had artery surgery complications and leaving for work while she was having a stroke. He maintains that he is deeply in love with her, and he would do nothing to hurt her, but he seems completely unwilling to deal with any difficult emotions.

My sister, and ICU nurse, is currently in charge of any medical related reality regarding my mother or any future decisions that may need to be made. 
One of our main concerns is that he has proposed to her and has been pressuring her to get married for the last two years. She originally maintained that she would never do this legally, but it seems that he has worn her down with time. He recently began bragging to me that they are going to elope and we would find out about it on Facebook after the fact. It seemed like a jab at the time because he probably has some idea that we are not in support of this.

We went through 2 really rough patches and I realized what kind of person she is and how she truly feels about me. Attacking my character, saying I’m a bridezilla, I don’t know what it’s like to work hard and I’ve never had a big girl job (I’m in a doctoral program) and that I force my fiance to spend his $ on me. I was so shocked and hurt (been in the family for 7 years when this all started) that I deleted all of our pics together off my social media. Was it immature? Probably. But i didn’t do this to intentionally hurt her~ more of something I needed to do for me to be emotionally “done”. Fiancé understood and was supportive of my decision to do this. We got through our rough patches, and I decided to forgive  (yet again) for the sake of my fiancé. I told FMIL it would take a long time for me to heal from this.

Months later, they came to visit us. Showed them my school, our fav restaurants & apartment. She threw a crying fit about us being out too long “this was my opportunity to relax from work and I wanted to go to the beach… I didn’t even want to go to lunch!” Just drama, no fun for anyone.

We gave them what they asked for. This was the third time they used our wedding against us and threatened to not come.

158,1ct6664,AITA for siding with my best friend's ex after their breakup?,"I need to get this story off my chest. So much shit that happened during this year so if ppl want me to elaborate I can. Everyone in the story ranges from 17-18yo during this time.

My friend, let's call her Ella, was talking to Andrew our senior year of high school. Eventually they started dating. There were issues in the relationship that she would frequently vent to me about. 

At this time, I had a crush on Andrew's friend, John. I told Ella about this. She liked the idea of me dating him since John was friends with Andrew. However, I had another friend, Jennifer, that was rumored to have a crush on John. I didn't want to make a move knowing that it might hurt my friendship with Jennifer. I found out that John asked out a girl. I was a little heartbroken, and Ella consoled me.

John started dating Natasha, their relationship was a shitshow. Because of this, Ella got closer with John. It got to the point where I thought she was cheating on Andrew. For example, she told me “I wish Andrew had John's personality, because John was much easier to talk to.” This made me sad for Andrew, as I didn't want Ella to play with him. I told Ella to cut ties with Andrew since it seemed she wasn’t into him, but she was unsure.

Three months later, the two couples planned a double date. Natasha & Andrew canceled last minute, leaving Ella & John alone. They decided to hangout by themselves since they were already at the mall. After hours passed, Natasha realized that her boyfriend was hanging out alone with Ella. An argument broke out between John and Natasha and he decided to break up with her that night.

Later on, Andrew asked Ella to prom. By now, Ella wanted to break up. Despite this, she said yes to him only to break up with him a couple of days later. We were all in the same prom group, and Ella wanted to kick him out since she wasn’t dating him anymore. During prom, we could tell that Ella & John had something going on from their matching outfits and touchiness. I felt bad for Andrew since he had to witness his ex and his friend being all romantic.

Eventually, Ella came up to me and asked ""Do you still have a crush on John?"" I knew why she was asking of course, I wasn't an idiot. Still, I prioritize my friendships over anything romantic, so I told her I didn’t. Ella kept this a complete secret from Jennifer, since she still thought that Jennifer still had a crush on John.

Ella upset me. She homie hopped. She ignored the crushes of her friends. Worst of all, she did not see her actions as being bad in any way. People would ask me about the situation since I was Ella's best friend, I would always take Andrew's side. I brought this up to Ella again, calling her out on the timing of everything. She brushed the situation off as funny memories. I grew distant with her for various reasons, including the events of this post.

We were all in the same prom group, and Ella wanted to kick him out since she wasn’t dating him anymore. During prom, we could tell that Ella & John had something going on from their matching outfits and touchiness. I felt bad for Andrew since he had to witness his ex and his friend being all romantic.

Eventually, Ella came up to me and asked ""Do you still have a crush on John?"" I knew why she was asking of course, I wasn't an idiot. Still, I prioritize my friendships over anything romantic, so I told her I didn’t. Ella kept this a complete secret from Jennifer, since she still thought that Jennifer still had a crush on John.

Ella upset me. She homie hopped. She ignored the crushes of her friends. Worst of all, she did not see her actions as being bad in any way. People would ask me about the situation since I was Ella's best friend, I would always take Andrew's side. I brought this up to Ella again, calling her out on the timing of everything. She brushed the situation off as funny memories. I grew distant with her for various reasons, including the events of this post. AITA for not taking my best friend's side?",0.0,0.1361021101474762,0,1

I (17f) have a friend who we'll call K (16f). K really likes a guy, has been talking about him publicly and mentioning him by name in front of my (small, ~10 people) class and on K's close friends story on insta. We'll call him Y (~17m). However, Y has a gf (~17m). We'll call her H. We all go to the same high school. Although I am now friends with K, I have known H for longer because we would do our assignments together during class and we have two classes in a row with each other although we don't talk much. I've never met Y, but I see him and H walking around the school together holding hands, and Y posts about H (H doesn't have an insta) on his instagram account, and has posted her multiple times. Here's the situation. K absolutely knows that Y is dating H, and she has been actively messaging him, pursuing him, flirting with him, sending him reels about relationships, going to his baseball games even when she was feeling sick, etc. She even said that she sent him some knock knock jock that goes
'knock knock,' 'who's there,' 'olive, 'olive who?' 'olive you! do you love me back?' And the real kicker is that he flirts back! He also sends K reels about being in a relationship and responded to K's knock knock joke with an answer similar to 'yeah lol' (1 don't remember the exact words, it was over 12 hours ago now. Now I haven't seen the screenshots of their messages between them and I don't know if they've met up outside of school, but I do know that K was talking about it very loudly in class today which is how I know most of this, the rest K has said on close friends. Speaking of K's close friends she posted some thing saying' Y is pretty like the ocean ' and put a picture of him in the middle of pictures of oceans. She has also posted many, many stories about relationships and having the text 'you know who you are' on some of them. And when K was speaking about their 'situation' in class, K revealed that Y had said that he was going to break up with his H (and from the context I am assuming that he's doing it to be with K). I have been very much avoiding K ever since I heard that she liked and was messaging a man with a gf and have been actively not engaging in conversation with her or giving her one-worded answers.

161,1ct5tvt,WIBTA for telling my roommate to turn down his volume,"I (24M) live in a shared apartment with two roommates (let's call them Jack, 23M and Ned, 24M). We're all graduate students and get along fine. We are usually away from the apartment during the day, and I personally don't usually see the other roommates very often.

Our apartment has paper-thin walls, so any sound that anyone makes, even in their own room with the door closed, can usually be heard in the other rooms. This is of course not ideal, especially when people sleep at different times.

Jack seems to be especially sensitive to noise. On one occasion, Ned had to get up very early in the morning (around 4 am?) for a meeting with his advisor from his home university in Europe. I was completely undisturbed, but Jack was apparently woken up when Ned was getting ready to leave (and Jack voiced this to Ned). On a few other occasions, I was taking calls around 11pm-12am, and Jack would come out and tell me to speak softer / turn down my volume, after which I would just end the call. I totally understand that there are reasonable expectations for the house to be quiet especially in late hours, and have since been consciously trying to keep noise to a minimum; i.e., by taking calls outside when possible.

The thing that irks me is that Jack happens to create a lot of noise himself. For example, he often plays music, mostly from genres with *elaborate* percussion and bass, on a speaker, and it is very audible from my room. He also takes calls in his room, which are almost certainly as audible in my room as my calls in his. The music happens typically around late evenings (say, 10pm-12am, occasionally after midnight, softer then but still very audible) and mornings (7-8am, sometimes around 6am).

Normally, I don't really care, and I have not once told him to turn his volume down. Having lived in shared housing before, I understand that everyone should have the freedom to listen to music on a speaker, or take calls at reasonable times. But recently I have been wondering whether the whole situation is a bit unfair: Jack is doing the exact same things that Jack would tell him to shut up for. And I *do* sometimes get woken up or otherwise find it hard to concentrate when there's a raging bassline ringing from his room (since I sometimes do work from my room).

162,1ct5smi,AITA for ignoring my friend during her anxiety attack?,"I (31M) just moved out and got my own apartment with my bf. I was renting a room at my friends’ Laura and Roger’s place for a few years and couldn’t take it anymore. They travel for work and have friends all over who fly in regularly and stay at their house. We live in Miami so people love visiting.

Over time, living there became increasingly stressful. They have what I called an “open house” policy. Friends can stay whenever they want. They had people over almost every week and many times I’d be the only one there to deal with the guests. While I ended up becoming friendly with many of them, it was totally out of my control when people would come and often at inconvenient times.

Laura also didn’t understand personal space and she’d enter my room all the time. She had me share my location on apple maps and my calendar with her so she basically knows where I am and what I’m doing at all times. She does this with all her friends because she likes to be “in the know”. 

Now that I have my own place, it’s been AMAZING for my mental health and relationship. We only moved 10 min away from Laura and Roger so they still ask me to stop by (for ex. to bring packages in) every now and then. I don’t mind this. I just hope it doesn’t get out of control. They also have persistently suggested we get a guest bed (insinuating that we could help host their guests). We have declined numerous times.

Today Laura called me 3 times in a row and texted me to see if she could come over. I let all the calls go to VM and told her I was on a video call for work. She texted back saying she would sit in my living room and be quiet. I didn’t reply.

I love her dearly but she can be extremely needy and the reason I moved out was due to a desperate need for space/privacy/peace. I found out hours later that she was having anxiety. These episodes have been going on for years now. I’m exhausted because I have anxiety too and I need her to figure out how to lean on someone else. I broke down in March because I couldn’t deal with it anymore.

On one hand, I feel terrible because she and Roger have some heavy things happening right now and I should be a better friend. But on the other hand, I’m burnt out and I desperately want to focus on my own life/ mental health /relationship. I need space.

I could write a novel with more details. But the gist is I LOVE my friends and they are amazing in many ways that I haven’t mentioned but I feel suffocated! I thought moving out would fix everything but it’s not.

165,1ct5c4t,AITA for not allowing my mom’s ex-fiancé to my wedding ceremony?,"I’m getting married in a week and my fiancé and I have had our wedding planned for over a year now. We’re having our ceremony in our backyard because we wanted it small, only including immediate family (excluding our fathers for other reasons.)

Now my mom separated from her ex-fiancé a little over a year ago. My soon to be wife and I have been incredibly supportive of her decision even though her ex was never truly a bad person to her. Bought her a house, helped her pursue every endeavor she’s asked for, been there for her during the passing of relatives, etc. Bottom line, they just don’t get along but they function better as friends versus lovers.

Fast forward to this past January and we (my fiancé and I) are making final decisions on who to invite. My mom and her ex are friends at this point and we figured we could invite him to our reception, but not the ceremony. I ask my mom if she would be comfortable with that and she said, of course. Mind you, she has had nothing but terrible things to say about the guy, even since they became friends again. I feel sympathy for him because he’s done way more good for her than bad.

So, this past Sunday we took her out for mother’s day but the day before she told me that her and ex are back together and have been for a month. I don’t understand why, considering she says how much she hates him but okay, whatever. While we are all having a nice lunch though, I remind of our plans for our wedding ceremony (we’re literally only having 12 people.) But she chimes in and says 13, including her ex. I didn’t say anything at the time but it irked me that she would assume such a thing without asking me, especially considering our wedding is less than 2 weeks away. I didn’t want to shoot her down at the moment because I was trying to make her Mother’s Day a pleasant one, but I knew as soon as she said it, that wasn’t going to have it.

We’ve been very meticulously planning this day for a long time now and compromised on a lot of things, especially for my mom’s sake. I might add, we’re paying for, decorating, planning for all of this on our own. My soon to be wife and I have been through hell getting this all together, but it’s coming together and we want it to go according to OUR plan.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-16,"AITA for not allowing my mom’s ex-fiancé to my wedding ceremony? I’m getting married in a week and my fiancé and I have had our wedding planned for over a year now. We’re having our ceremony in our backyard because we wanted it small, only including immediate family (excluding our fathers for other reasons.)

Now my mom separated from her ex-fiancé a little over a year ago. My soon to be wife and I have been incredibly supportive of her decision even though her ex was never truly a bad person to her. Bought her a house, helped her pursue every endeavor she’s asked for, been there for her during the passing of relatives, etc. Bottom line, they just don’t get along but they function better as friends versus lovers.

Fast forward to this past January and we (my fiancé and I) are making final decisions on who to invite. My mom and her ex are friends at this point and we figured we could invite him to our reception, but not the ceremony. I ask my mom if she would be comfortable with that and she said, of course. Mind you, she has had nothing but terrible things to say about the guy, even since they became friends again. I feel sympathy for him because he’s done way more good for her than bad.

So, this past Sunday we took her out for mother’s day but the day before she told me that her and ex are back together and have been for a month. I don’t understand why, considering she says how much she hates him but okay, whatever. While we are all having a nice lunch though, I remind of our plans for our wedding ceremony (we’re literally only having 12 people.) But she chimes in and says 13, including her ex. I didn’t say anything at the time but it irked me that she would assume such a thing without asking me, especially considering our wedding is less than 2 weeks away. I didn’t want to shoot her down at the moment because I was trying to make her Mother’s Day a pleasant one, but I knew as soon as she said it, that wasn’t going to have it.

We’ve been very meticulously planning this day for a long time now and compromised on a lot of things, especially for my mom’s sake. I might add, we’re paying for, decorating, planning for all of this on our own. My soon to be wife and I have been through hell getting this all together, but it’s coming together and we want it to go according to OUR plan.

166,1ct5a5r,AITA for calling my Dad selfish and a liar for not coming to my wedding because he was too busy building another house and also using my inheritance money for the build ,"For context I'm a 25(f) and I live in Australia with my Grandmother and my Mum. I'm really fortunate in the fact that I don't have to pay too much rent and I'm living in a little shack at the back of the house. My wife is a 26(f) who is American and stuck overseas and we've been apart for some time trying to organise visas. I had originally planned to move over there but there have been immigration delays, and now my wife is planning to come to Australia. The visa for Aus is quite expensive. And despite not having to pay much rent, I work in childcare and don't earn very much money and need to pay for therapy and groceries etc. It's been tough with this cost of living crisis. I have been struggling to find a higher paying job and with HECS debts for uni going up and not being able to afford higher education. I'm in a tough spot. Now, my relationship with my Dad is interesting. He was emotionally abusive growing up and I have a lot of trauma from him, which was exacerbated from living with him and his wife for two years in my early twenties. They've had a history of not being particularly nice to me to put it lightly and favouring her biological children. Now my Dad is a pilot and makes very good money and so does his wife. They own five properties and do well for themselves. They even bought my step sister a house. Now, when I was in my teens my Dad bought an apartment and he promised me that when he sold it, the money would go to me so that I could help support myself financially and potentially buy my own home. Which is a dream for so many young people. Now last year my Dad and his wife decided to buy another home and tore it down to build over it. They've been so distracted by this build that they didn't make it to my wedding and forgot to tell me they weren't coming much to my horror. I was beyond upset but not surprised as he's missed countless things  throughout my life including musicals I've been in, my own formal, my high school graduation. So no surprises there. 

Anyway, recently my Dad told me that they planned on selling the apartment and using all the money on building this ""dream home"" as they refer to it. I've been in shock about it for a few weeks now and don't know what to make of this. I'm hurt all over again. My Dad knows I have been struggling financially for some time and emotionally especially being apart from my wife. I messaged my Dad and told him that he's selfish and that he should give me some of the funds from the property sale as promised to at least go towards my wife's visa. He's ignored my message and doesn't want to talk about this.

The issue now is the fact that my dad and step mom DON’T feed my sister. My sister has lost so much weight since she moved there and it really breaks my heart.

168,1ct4zaz,AITAH for teasing a rival sports team fan in a non-sports venue?,"A little background for those who don't know the sports landscape.  The Dodgers are a Major League Baseball team and play in Los Angeles (Southern California) and have been bitter rivals with the San Francisco Giants (Northern California) for over 60 years.  My family and I live in Los Angeles and are huge Dodgers fans.


So my wife and I are shopping at Target today.  I see a gentleman wearing a SF Giants sweater.  At the time of this incident, the Dodgers had beaten the Giants badly the last two days playing on the road in San Francisco.  As the man approached me, I asked ""How did the Dodgers do the last two games against the Giants?  I forgot.""  He didn't respond and kind of looked surprised that a stranger had even spoken to him.  He walked one direction and my wife and I went the other.  My wife says, ""You shouldn't have said anything, we don't know if he has a sense of humor.""  The guy hears this and says, ""Where is your car parked again?""  Clearly he has a sense of humor, and nothing more happened at the store.  


When I relayed to this story to my two children, one said that it was fine, and that's normal banter between rival teams' fans.  But my other son thinks I was totally the AH.  His argument was that it would have been different at a game or a sports bar.  But he was at a store, and I shouldn't have said anything to him at all.  My counter is that this guy was wearing gear from a rival team in our city, not his.  By virtue of choosing to represent his team, he is open to any teasing that may occur.

171,1ct4jaz,AITA for uninviting my BIL from my sons’s graduation party because he disagrees with my son’s college choice?,"My son is graduating high school in 2 weeks. I personally had some turmoil at that age so I didn’t graduate and had to get my GED a few years later, didn’t go to college, so I am incredibly proud of him and all he accomplished in school. He also got into an Ivy League for college, which made me even prouder.


Here is the problem. My wife and several family members, including her brother and father, all went to this same Ivy school. So my wife really pushed for him to go there. An unhealthy amount imo. She has always run a tight ship with his schooling over the years, while I’ve been more lax and said that if he is legitimately trying his hardest between school and extracurricular and social life then all is ok even if he struggles sometimes. Now that the “payoff” is here, wife was insistent that he goes to this school. I’ve told him he could go anywhere he wants and go into whatever field he wants, or he could even take a gap year or go straight to work; whatever makes him happy. He got into an Ivy. He showed he’s good enough, now let him follow his dreams. My son did two visits to this school and confided in me that he did not want to go there because of both the culture, and he felt like the program he was interested in was better at another school. He was scared to tell his mom to disappoint her. The three of us sat down and talked about how he was feeling. Wife was clearly disappointed but accepted his decision, although we did get into an argument a week later about how he might regret this years from now.

Once the news broke that he would not be going to the Ivy, wife’s family expressed their disagreement with the decision. I laid down the law with how this was his choice and he’s still going to an excellent school and he’s pursuing his passion, so I will not tolerate any harassing him or telling him that he’s making the wrong choice. Most did not put up much of a fight, but my wife’s brother is being a real jerk about it. All three times that we’ve seen him in the past two months since this all started, he has made comments to my son about how the Ivy is much better and such. I yelled at him last time when I saw it and he lamely apologized.

So my son’s graduation is in 2 weeks, and his party with family and friends will be a few days after that. My son told me privately that he does not want his uncle to be there because he is uncomfortable around him and doesn’t want to feel that way at his party. I said ok, no problem, and texted BIL that he needs to sit the party out because he is making my son feel bad for his choices. As can be expected, I am now under fire from my wife’s family. Everyone’s mad I’m excluding him from celebrating my son’s accomplishments and that my son can toughen up and whatnot, and my wife is mad that I went over her head. I felt like my wife would not be willing to cut out her brother, so I made the decision myself. I can accept partial blame for going over her head, but I have no regrets otherwise.

I personally had some turmoil at that age so I didn’t graduate and had to get my GED a few years later, didn’t go to college, so I am incredibly proud of him and all he accomplished in school. He also got into an Ivy League for college, which made me even prouder.


Here is the problem. My wife and several family members, including her brother and father, all went to this same Ivy school. So my wife really pushed for him to go there. An unhealthy amount imo. She has always run a tight ship with his schooling over the years, while I’ve been more lax and said that if he is legitimately trying his hardest between school and extracurricular and social life then all is ok even if he struggles sometimes. Now that the “payoff” is here, wife was insistent that he goes to this school. I’ve told him he could go anywhere he wants and go into whatever field he wants, or he could even take a gap year or go straight to work; whatever makes him happy. He got into an Ivy. He showed he’s good enough, now let him follow his dreams. My son did two visits to this school and confided in me that he did not want to go there because of both the culture, and he felt like the program he was interested in was better at another school. He was scared to tell his mom to disappoint her. The three of us sat down and talked about how he was feeling. Wife was clearly disappointed but accepted his decision, although we did get into an argument a week later about how he might regret this years from now.

Once the news broke that he would not be going to the Ivy, wife’s family expressed their disagreement with the decision. I laid down the law with how this was his choice and he’s still going to an excellent school and he’s pursuing his passion, so I will not tolerate any harassing him or telling him that he’s making the wrong choice. Most did not put up much of a fight, but my wife’s brother is being a real jerk about it. All three times that we’ve seen him in the past two months since this all started, he has made comments to my son about how the Ivy is much better and such. I yelled at him last time when I saw it and he lamely apologized.

So my son’s graduation is in 2 weeks, and his party with family and friends will be a few days after that. My son told me privately that he does not want his uncle to be there because he is uncomfortable around him and doesn’t want to feel that way at his party. I said ok, no problem, and texted BIL that he needs to sit the party out because he is making my son feel bad for his choices. As can be expected, I am now under fire from my wife’s family. Everyone’s mad I’m excluding him from celebrating my son’s accomplishments and that my son can toughen up and whatnot, and my wife is mad that I went over her head. I felt like my wife would not be willing to cut out her brother, so I made the decision myself. I can accept partial blame for going over her head, but I have no regrets otherwise.

172,1ct4ffw,AITA for turning down an invite?,"I am 24F and I was recently talking to my boyfriend’s mom. She invited me to her brothers 60th birthday. At first I lied and said I was busy but then she asked what I was busy with and I just simply told her I didn’t really want to go. She asked me why so I told her I didn’t really like big crowds of people and socialising isn’t really my thing (I am introverted and also have a spritz of social anxiety).
She just nodded and we went our separate ways. I thought this was all okay until a few hours later I get a phone call off my boyfriend saying I disrespected his mother and I was lucky to even be considered as an invite. 

So I think I might be an asshole for lying to his mom.

173,1ct4aai,AITA for not housing my alcoholic sister?,"My sister has been a best friend of mine since we were kids. We were the total attached at the hip package. You couldn’t find us in a room not playing around and getting into mischief. 

My older brother and I turned out to be the successful ones (as of now), whereas my sister always struggled and would take 2 steps forward and 1 back. 

About 2 years ago, she was in a super abusive and toxic relationship. I offered to let her move in with me in a different state to launch her into a better situation. She agreed and moved in for a year. Around that time, she met a girl and they started dating. It has been a great relationship, the first stable one, but my sister has fallen into some poor habits. 

I travel a lot for work, like maybe 2 weeks out of every month, and so I never could tell my sister was developing a drinking habit. I’d see a lot of cans, but when you’re gone for 2 weeks you can’t assume it was a nightly thing. Anyways, she moved out and for 7-8 months it seemed like her and her girlfriend were the real deal. About 2 months ago, her girlfriend starting telling me about their issues, and it revolved around my sisters drinking. It started small, but it has snowballed into hiding it, bingeing, tantrums when caught and the full 9 yards. Her gf finally had enough, and asked her to leave the house. 

She asked me if she could move into my new home, and while I love my sister, I have far too often taken the savior role and am in therapy trying to be better about not taking on others burdens. I told her no, not because I didn’t love her, but because she needed to learn to save herself and pull herself up. 

She freaked out. Said I was being a terrible brother and that I didn’t care about her at all and wanted her to get worse. That I was taking revenge on her for when she abandoned me (long story, rough childhood and she dipped at the lowest point) and that I clearly thought I was better than her. 

I don’t, at all, but I know if I let her in it won’t get better, and my life will become going behind and trying to catch her and help her. It’s not my place to do it, and I think she needs to move home and seek out inpatient facilities.

I think I really need some help about whether or not I have been the asshole here.
I invited a friend to accompany me to a charity ball last weekend. He happily accepted and drove around 1 and 1/2 hours to get to my house. It was a ball that was being thrown for my boyfriend's charity so we were guests at it and on our best behaviour. During the night we were talking about bidding in the auction and also buying bricks for the new building that the charity was putting up. 
My friend said he was happy to buy his brick for £50 and he also bid in the auction and accidentally won something that he didn't really want for £80.

I agreed to buy the thing for £80 off him because it was closer to where I lived. Therefore, I'd spent £80 more than I meant to.
It's worth noting that I also paid for his ticket for £50 which he knew about.
When the charity people came to take his money for the brick I said hey... Why don't you buy two bricks? 

He initially refused and I joked come on dude. This bit is on me... I pushed it and said I've bought something from the auction from you. It's already less than you planned to spend and also less than the dinner ticket. It's also worth noting that I did this in front of two beautiful 18-year-old girls (he is over 50). 

He immediately got incredibly upset at me and said that he did not expect to be spoken to like that and left the ball and drove all the way home. I found it very unusual because we often joke around like that and that wasn't an unusual thing to say to each other. We joke around and make fun of each other. But I really think that I hit a sensitive spot for him. I apologised at the time and tried to make it up SO MUCH but he had none of it. 

I'm now struggling to apologise after thinking about it, because I'm not sure what happened and I'm not sure that I was wrong so guys help me out. AITA?",Asshole,2024-05-16,"AITA - I am cheeky or he is tight AITA?

176,1ct3mgs,AITA for wearing white to my lesbian friends wedding,"Hey guys, Im a bit torn up right now as my friend is very upset at me yet I feel as though I did nothing wrong. throwaway as almost all parties use reddit, fake names for privacy  
  
A bit of context I (F27) met my best friend Grace (F25) in high school. We went to college together and shared a dorm, with this other girl Sarah (F25) who Grace suggested  
  
Two years into college Grace come to me in private and said she had something to tell me and hoped I wouldnt judge her. She was into women and her and Sarah had been dating for over 3 years. I was a bit shocked considering we tell each other everything but I fully supported her and her Girlfriend  
  
About a year ago Grace wanted to propose to Sarah and I helped with everything it was so cute and Sarah said yes. Though through the planning I kept asking Grace who her maid of honor was and she kept dodging my question. turns out Sarah didn't want me in the wedding at all. I was crushed as i thought that not only was I Graces best friend but Sarahs friend to. Grace told me I wouldnt fit Sarahs aesthetics she had planned, and I wasn't allowed in. I asked what that meant and Grace said Sarah wanted the wedding party to dress more masculine and I was too feminine to fit in. to make it up to me Grace said that if I wasnt in the wedding party i would be allowed to dress as fancy as I wanted. I was really sad but I excepted their wishes  
  
I spent the next while looking for a dress to wear and found a absolutely beautiful dress. I loved and I showed Grace and she did to. only problem I didn't realize until it was time to order was it only came in white. I had my heart set on the dress and since the bridal party and both brides would be wearing suits I didn't see a problem with the color  
  
day of the wedding I got weird look but it wasnt a problem until Sarah saw me she was fuming wouldnt talk to me and kept Grace away from me. right before the ceremony some girl in the bridal party dumped a glass of red wine on my back. I was upset and confronted Sarah. I told her what I said above that they werent in white dresses nowhere did it say not to wear white and if she really had a problem with it they couldve asked me to leave. there was no reason to be childish and ruin my new expensive dress. She said it common sense and I was the childish one for wearing white as retaliation to not being in bridal party. I said that wasnt it I was hurt but Id never try and get revenge grace told me I could dress up nice like I usually do and thats what I did. Sarah told me she doesnt want to talk to me and told me to leave before she made me. I told her I would as long as the girl who dumped the wine would pay to clean the dress. She dismissed me and kicked me out  
  
I went home that night and people were blowing up my phone many told me I was a piece of shit for what I did though I had a few friends reach out to me and say they understand and thought it was childish to purposefully stain the dress instead of talking it out like adult
