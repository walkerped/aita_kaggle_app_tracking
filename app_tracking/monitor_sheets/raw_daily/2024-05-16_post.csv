0,1ctj9qx,WIBTA if I didn’t come out to my family as trans?,"I (14M) have known about me being trans for about a year now. I’m comfortable with myself and thinking about myself as a guy (using non-binary/transmasc pronouns) has helped me with my gender dysphoria a lot. 

My mom’s side of the family is super supportive with LGBTQ+ stuff. I’m also bisexual and going to pride this weekend with my best friend, so I’m planning on testing the waters when I see them next and telling them I’m bi. But I know they’d be chill with me being bi or trans, they’re just really nice people and I’ve always felt comfortable around them.

My dad’s side, however, is pretty dysfunctional and I’m not sure if I’m going to tell them. My aunt was always the favorite, which has caused a lot of issues between my dad and his parents. My aunt’s kids are also horrible and my aunt expects me to help her with a lot of stuff, even though she was never there for me during my childhood.

My grandma is in her 80s and my grandpa as well. My grandpa is in the midst of a really bad depression (he has been for a year) and we’re not sure how much longer he’ll be in it for. And although they’re not against queer people, my grandma is pretty Christian, as well as all of my extended family on that side.

My parents want to move north in a few years, so I’m honestly thinking about not telling my dad’s side. I don’t want to tell my grandparents and cause further strained tensions between my dad and his parents, especially since I’m not sure how much longer they have left. My aunt and uncle also don’t really like us anyways, so I don’t want to ruin any remaining relationship between my dad and his family in the last few years we’re staying in state.

After we move, we’ll probably not have a lot of contact with my dad’s side as they’re not extremely close anyways. I still feel like it’s an asshole-y thing to do, as I’m trying to transition from FtM early (I’m practicing voice changes, dressing more masc, and having a high T diet so when I finally get on T it’ll be easier for my transition) so they might have their suspicions, I just won’t confirm it.

1,1ct2zhq,AITA for laughing at a joke someone made about my SIL?,"I (27f) have been married to my husband (29m) for 2 years. He has an ex wife (Allie- fake name,29f) and he and she have two kids together, a boy and a girl. We all get along really well, even if we aren’t doing family dinners etc like some co parents do. 

This story is about my brothers wife, Caitlin (also fake name, 19f). My husband and I recently had twins (b/g) and sadly our son didn’t make it. It’s been a long couple of months with our grief and having my first baby, after a rough pregnancy. 

My brother is in the army, and while he’s doing some training, his wife is staying with us, because they’re moving soon after he’s finished. It was fine at first, until Caitlin started making little digs about me. That I haven’t lost the baby weight, if I don’t want to stay my size I shouldn’t eat xyz, etc and when my stepkids are here, she once remarked that “it was good my husband managed to get at least one son.” She’s careful to only say these things where I can hear them and no one else. It’s gotten to be a lot to take. I’ve spent a lot of time crying over the things she’s said to/ about me on top of still grieving my son. I haven’t told anybody what she’s been doing just because I don’t have it in me to have one more thing for people to feel bad for me about. Until this past Friday. 

Friday afternoon, Allie dropped the kids off for the weekend, and while I was standing there talking to her, I guess I looked really upset (Caitlin had just made another crappy comment). And I ended up telling her everything. I told her the last thing Caitlin had said about my weight before Allie and the kids got there. Unfortunately (for Caitlin at least) Allie has a complete lack of what you’d call “give a fuck”. Caitlin walks into the room and I’m teary eyed and Caitlin makes a comment about me being whiny. Allie immediately fires back (with a tone I’ve NEVER heard her use) with “you know being a pick me bitch doesn’t burn calories. If it did maybe you wouldn’t look like a beluga whale.” 

At first I was stunned into silence but before I even realized it I had started laughing. Caitlin immediately starts crying and leaves the room. Allie goes home, and I get a call from my brother telling me I’m terrible because apparently Caitlin had an ED in her younger teenage years and I was insensitive to that by laughing at allie’s mean comment. While I tried to explain to him that she’s been making nonstop comments towards me he didn’t care and kept trying to call me out on it.

4,1ct29cx,AITA for calling out my husband’s family as alcoholic assholes?,"AITA: Family

My husband has been away from home for almost 2 weeks working in the city he is from (6hrs away).

He has 7 siblings (all over 50 so we aren’t taking young families). When he called his family a month ago to say that he was coming into town and would like to see everybody his family members all offered to have him stay with them and told him it would be silly to get a hotel. Therefore, we didn’t book a hotel. 

He planned to do a rotation of about two nights at a few sibling’s homes.  

My husband is a recovering alcoholic and they are all well aware of that. He has had some serious health concerns due to his previous drinking so it is crucial that he remains sober. He has been attending AA while out of town and doing well. It is literally life and death for him.  

He arrived on a Thursday and on Friday night the sister that he was staying with planned to get together barbecue at her home. Everyone was drinking to the point of drunkenness and it made my husband uncomfortable so he went up to bed after a few hours. He did not expect them to not drink in front of him but enough is enough after a while.

After that, his family decided that that was so incredibly rude of him and said that they wouldn’t be changing their lifestyle to accommodate him. After he finished two nights at that sister‘s home (morning after the bbq) all of the other family members said that they didn’t feel comfortable with him staying with them. We’ve spent about $3000 in hotel rooms thus far. 

My husband owns his own business so it is not like he can apply for corporate lodging reimbursement. 

ONE sister called (who was out of town at the time) me at work and when I couldn’t answer texted me I needed to call her ASAP and scared me half to death until my staff meeting was over. Turns out she was mad my husband went to bed after a few hours (like 9pm) even though she was not there to even witness it. 

Once I returned her call and realized that it was not an emergency. My blood began to boil. I told her how rude and inconsiderate. Their family wants to sit around and drink bottles and bottles of wine at an event that was supposed to be celebrating a visit from their brother who lives out of town and only visits once or twice per year. 

I also said that it was a really asshole move for everyone to say that he made them uncomfortable and they no longer wanted him to stay at their house. I said I’m sorry that my husband sobriety cramps everyone’s wine drinking, beer chugging style.

6,1ct1t9r,AITA for getting into an argument with my wife over dog poo?,"My wife and I live in a HOA (which sucks), but we follow the rules. One of the rules is to pick up after your dog as a common courtesy to your neighbors. My wife 44f and myself 40m also have a dog whom I walk and clean up after.

We live in a decent neighborhood and I like to work in my yard and take very good care of it. I also spend a small fortune on it by treating it, weeding it etc. I came home today from a long day's work and found myself drinking a cold beer while walking over the lawn and enjoying the view. I have been working on this yard for six years and have turned it around from the previous owners who really didn't take good care of it.

I was walking through my yard and I stepped on a big pile of steaming shit, which you can tell came from a large dog. I immediately get upset about it and clean it off of my shoes and then clean it from my yard. I was so upset about it that I had to go inside and chill for a minute.

I'm a bit paranoid about home security so I have cameras all around my house on the outside. I did some investigation and found out who didn't clean up their dog poo. After fifteen minutes I have the clip of who let their dog shit in my yard.

I told my wife I was going to walk down the street to the neighbors which is three houses down and confront them about this. I was going to be polite and ask them to clean up after their dog and hand them their dog's big pile of shit. My wife immediately starts to tell me not to do that and that she doesn't want to start a neighbor war. I start to get a little snippy and raise my voice a bit saying, ""These are the rules and I want to let them know I caught you and have them apologize for it!"". 

The part that really upsets me in the clip is that the owner of the dog was about to pick it up with a plastic bag. You can see clearly in the video (which I don't know if I can post it here) that the neighbor bent over and acted like she was cleaning it up. I think that is where I was even more upset about the situation. She had the bag and all!

My wife starts to get really upset that I want to do this and walk down and just have a conversation. She then states, "" We don't want to do anything because they might get upset and turn you into the HOA."" I disagreed with her about this and stated that I wanted to do it anyways and I did. I politely went down there and asked them to pick up after their dog and that I didn't appreciate it. The husband got his wife who was the one that pretended to pick it up. He apologized and so did she.

My wife 44f and myself 40m also have a dog whom I walk and clean up after.

We live in a decent neighborhood and I like to work in my yard and take very good care of it. I also spend a small fortune on it by treating it, weeding it etc. I came home today from a long day's work and found myself drinking a cold beer while walking over the lawn and enjoying the view. I have been working on this yard for six years and have turned it around from the previous owners who really didn't take good care of it.

I was walking through my yard and I stepped on a big pile of steaming shit, which you can tell came from a large dog. I immediately get upset about it and clean it off of my shoes and then clean it from my yard. I was so upset about it that I had to go inside and chill for a minute.

I'm a bit paranoid about home security so I have cameras all around my house on the outside. I did some investigation and found out who didn't clean up their dog poo. After fifteen minutes I have the clip of who let their dog shit in my yard.

I told my wife I was going to walk down the street to the neighbors which is three houses down and confront them about this. I was going to be polite and ask them to clean up after their dog and hand them their dog's big pile of shit. My wife immediately starts to tell me not to do that and that she doesn't want to start a neighbor war. I start to get a little snippy and raise my voice a bit saying, ""These are the rules and I want to let them know I caught you and have them apologize for it!"". 

The part that really upsets me in the clip is that the owner of the dog was about to pick it up with a plastic bag. You can see clearly in the video (which I don't know if I can post it here) that the neighbor bent over and acted like she was cleaning it up. I think that is where I was even more upset about the situation. She had the bag and all!

My wife starts to get really upset that I want to do this and walk down and just have a conversation. She then states, "" We don't want to do anything because they might get upset and turn you into the HOA."" I disagreed with her about this and stated that I wanted to do it anyways and I did. I politely went down there and asked them to pick up after their dog and that I didn't appreciate it. The husband got his wife who was the one that pretended to pick it up. He apologized and so did she. 

After all of this my wife is upset at me. I don't feel like I did anything wrong but wanted to stop something from happening again by owners of pets not taking responsibility for their pets' droppings.",0.0,0.9452711,1,0

I recently saved up enough money to buy my own used car. The problem is in my state you have to be 18 in order to have your own insurance ( unless you’re on ur parent’s insurance).  
My parents do not want me to drive alone because “ you don’t have enough experience “, which is true I don’t but how am I supposed to gain those experiences w/o driving alone. 
So, today, I told my mom that I found a car within my budget and if she could add me to her insurance I can give her the money for the extra cost every month. She proceeds to say that “ let your dad help you buy a car” but I responded “ I don’t want him to help me”. Somehow this made her furious. She said I was disrespectful for declining help from her parents and that because im turning 18 , I want to do what I want. Which is partially true because im an independent person. I never depend on my parents for anything. I got my first job at 14 and saved up since then. Somehow the whole car argument turned into you’re acting “grown” and we can’t talk to you anymore, so I should move out when I turn 18 or she can kick me out now 
Which shocked me because everytime I talk about leaving for college next year, they are opposed to it? Either way, im so confused on why they are so upset that I want my independence. The reason I want a car is because whenever I ask anyone to take me to work or if I miss the school bus it’s a whole hassle for them.

My now ex best friend sophias (f17) birthday was yesterday, she told me last year her birthday was on mother's day, so I assumed its the same this year (I honestly had no idea mothers day was a different date every year, I struggle paying attention specifically to dates, and months, I barely know what month it is currently all the time.

Pastel pink washes me out completely.

The pastel pink dress made me look like a washed-out ghost, and I knew there was no way I could wear it on Jessica's big day.

16,1ct0wcu,AITA for refusing to housesit for my brother?," 

I have an older brother who has been very good to me over the years – the biggest example is about 10 years ago he gave me $50k so I could graduate college without debt. We’re not as close as that gesture might make it seem, mainly because he moved states several years ago and we hardly saw each other, but he recently move back to our rural hometown – about 1.5 hours from my tiny house in the city, and we're starting to get closer again. 

About six months ago I had a fully remote job. My brother asked me to house sit his dog and two cats while he went away for 2 weeks (the animals can’t stay with me because my housemate is allergic). I agreed and it was horrible – he had a rat infestation (apparently my brother didn’t know, somehow) and I had to beg another friend to let me stay with them while the exterminator did his thing. I was terrified of the rats so I couldn’t stay put. Not to mention the dog particularly was a lot of work, we went for 4 walks a day and the dog's not very friendly so I need to keep a watchful eye. 

About three months ago, it was a similar situation, where my brother asked me to house sit for one week and I agreed again. My brother assured me the rats were gone, and indeed they were (although I was paranoid and thought I could hear them in the walls), and otherwise there was no incident.

Now my brother is going away for two weeks and wants me to house sit again. Here’s the thing though: I have a new job that is in person 4-days a week (no longer a remote job like last time), and staying at his house would mean a daily 2.5 hour commute (roundtrip), plus the animals would be alone for 8 hours at a time (the cats would be fine, but the dog I’m worried about).

My brother assures me the dog will be fine (he says he does it all the time), & also that the rats remain gone.

Reddit, my brother has done a lot for me when I was younger, especially financially. We are NOT rich so it meant a lot and was a sacrifice. However, I told him I don’t really want to housesit for the reasons above (commute + fear of rats). I've already done it a few times and I'm over it.

We’re not as close as that gesture might make it seem, mainly because he moved states several years ago and we hardly saw each other, but he recently move back to our rural hometown – about 1.5 hours from my tiny house in the city, and we're starting to get closer again. 

About six months ago I had a fully remote job. My brother asked me to house sit his dog and two cats while he went away for 2 weeks (the animals can’t stay with me because my housemate is allergic). I agreed and it was horrible – he had a rat infestation (apparently my brother didn’t know, somehow) and I had to beg another friend to let me stay with them while the exterminator did his thing. I was terrified of the rats so I couldn’t stay put. Not to mention the dog particularly was a lot of work, we went for 4 walks a day and the dog's not very friendly so I need to keep a watchful eye. 

About three months ago, it was a similar situation, where my brother asked me to house sit for one week and I agreed again. My brother assured me the rats were gone, and indeed they were (although I was paranoid and thought I could hear them in the walls), and otherwise there was no incident.

Now my brother is going away for two weeks and wants me to house sit again. Here’s the thing though: I have a new job that is in person 4-days a week (no longer a remote job like last time), and staying at his house would mean a daily 2.5 hour commute (roundtrip), plus the animals would be alone for 8 hours at a time (the cats would be fine, but the dog I’m worried about).

My brother assures me the dog will be fine (he says he does it all the time), & also that the rats remain gone.

Reddit, my brother has done a lot for me when I was younger, especially financially. We are NOT rich so it meant a lot and was a sacrifice. However, I told him I don’t really want to housesit for the reasons above (commute + fear of rats). I've already done it a few times and I'm over it. AITA?",0.0,0.051047396,0,1
17,1ct0vtb,AITA for getting takeout with my friend’s girlfriend ,"I’m 29M, my friend is 25M, and his gf is 22F. 

They’ve been having relationship issues for a while and I’ve somehow became the mediator for their problems through both of them constantly bringing up their problems with me. My friend has OCD, so this triggers a lot of arguments they have. It gets exhausting to deal with, but he’s slowly making progress so I continue to support them when they need to talk. Just to be clear, I’ve told them multiple times I’m just giving my opinion and I’m not a substitute for relationship therapy. I also told them multiple times I think they should not date and are extremely incompatible, but if they’re both willing to work on their issues then I’ll support them where I can. So today it seems I was the cause of triggering his OCD, or maybe I was just being an asshole. You guys tell me:

His gf and I became “close” in the sense that we’re friends because I give her my 3rd person perspective on their problems and she can vent to me about it. I really don’t have any intention with her and she’s never done anything inappropriate to make me think her intentions aren’t platonic either. I’m not attracted to her anyway and I’m not the kind of guy to go after any friend’s gf. 

Anyway it was nice out today so we tried inviting my friend outside to toss a football around. He said he was busy with work so me and her decided to go do that, and she invited one of her girlfriends. Her friend left and we were hungry so we got takeout and went home, separately obviously. We didn’t tell my friend because we didn’t really think it was necessary to get his permission.

My friend called me and asked what I was up to and I told him what I did with my day. He told me to fuck off and said I went behind his back and crossed a boundary he thought I would have never crossed. Before blocking both me and his gf, he insinuated that I was being sketchy with her and my intentions were bad. He was mad that I didn’t tell him I did that stuff with her. I didn’t really get to say much to him so I guess that’s that?

Like me and my friend are/were extremely close. We’ve known each other for the better part of a decade and have cried in each others arms before. He’s had his ocd moments with me before but nothing like this and it’s always been manageable. He should know me better than that. He should trust his best friend and his gf. He knows what we talk about and I never hide anything from him. He’s trusted me this far with his relationship issues, I don’t understand why this is suddenly a “crossed boundary”.

19,1ct0r2e,AITA for leaving my friend behind on a hiking trip?,"I just got back from a hiking trip with a group of friends. We’ve been planning this trip for months, and it was supposed to be a challenging but rewarding trek through some truly beautiful terrain in the Italian Dolomites. One of the newer additions to our friend group, Jake (fake name ofc), insisted on joining us even though he’s not particularly fit or nearly as experienced as the rest of us. We did tell him this, and emphasized how much we wanted to see **all** of the famous viewpoints along the route of the hike.

From the start, Jake was struggling. He was slow, constantly needed breaks, and was clearly having a hard time with the pace and the terrain. We tried to encourage him and adjusted our pace a bit, but it became clear that at his pace, we wouldn’t be able to do our intended route and make it to our planned campsite before dark. There was, however, another pretty easy but definitivelt boring route we could've taken to make it to camp well before nightfall.

After a group discussion, we decided it was best to send Jake down the easy road alone, and then all meet up back at camp once the rest of us had finished our planned adventure. We left Jake with plenty of supplies and a map with clear instructions on how to reach the campsite at his own pace. Jake seemed a little unhappy when we told him the plan, but agreed anyway.

When we finally regrouped that night, Jake was furious. He accused us of abandoning him and putting him in danger. He said he felt humiliated and that we should have all stuck together, no matter what.

The friend group is now pretty divided about what happened. Some of us (myself included) think we made the right call for the enjoyment of the group, while others have agreed with Jake in hindsight, and think we should have stayed together.

20,1ct0p30,"AITA, Basement Blues and Ques","A few months ago, my husband and I decided to remodel our basement. We discussed what we wanted and then decided to select a contractor to complete the job. Although we both made this decision, I was the main contact identifying and meeting with contractors. This involved meeting them before, during, and after work. I also managed the quotes and managed the details. My husband was hands off in the process. When I found one contractor to move forward with our project, my husband did not offer any specifics or terms when we met to finalize our plans. To get ready for the work, we decided to move our existing furniture and storage into a pod.  My husband did not help. When the contracting work began, again, I was the main contact checking on plans, issuing checks, reviewing suggestions, and enforcing our requirements. The work was completed and it looked fantastic. Due to our budget, we were only able to finish half the basement so one half is finished, while the other half is unfinished. When we moved our old furniture and storage back into the basement, this stuff was moved to the unfinished side. After begging my husband to move the furniture back out of the pod, he didn’t do it. We had relatives in town over a holiday and I had them help to clear out the pod. Once everything was on the unfinished side, everything was pretty unorganized and chaotic. Again, I asked for help to clear out the unfinished side and he didn’t help. I got up early before work over multiple days to organize and clear out the space. About two months ago, my husband brought a baseball tee and soft toss balls to toss to our kids in the basement on the unfinished side. He decided our teenagers could practice their baseball swings on the unfinished side. I am furious. After listening to these soft toss balls hit on the unfinished walls and doors, I can’t stand it anymore.

The least he can do is put up nets and I will compromise with the nets but I can’t accept them hitting balls in that area. He said I was being unreasonable but if I wanted the nets that I could put them up. I told him I would not and if he can’t protect that area, he can find another place to practice with the kids. AITA? We have a full backyard and a membership at a local hitting facility. I am mentally drained and have thoughts about how he must value what I do very little. I have other examples like this where he has taken my efforts for granted and then proceed to trample on things he has had no sweat equity in. He doesn’t clean, he doesn’t wash clothes or fold clothes. He doesn’t clean anything in the house or our yard. Is this my que to leave?

I (F28) and my partner (M26) of 3.5 years are planning to attend his best friend’s wedding in a month. My partner is the officiant.  We have been aware of this wedding for almost 1.5 years and will be having to travel about 16 hours by car with our two dogs in order to attend. We have some family that we will be visiting after the wedding and they will be watching our dogs while we attend the wedding. 

My partner has a really difficult time with procrastination and not taking care of “important” (his words) tasks. This has been a struggle for him, and previously I used to pick up a lot of his slack which led to some conflict in our relationship. I have since set some boundaries with myself (thanks to therapy) around not doing certain things for him and have backed off pretty much completely on jumping in to help. Some of these things included reminding him about bills, scheduling appointments, events, etc. 

One of our dogs has extreme anxiety and is a high energy breed. I say this is “our” dog because of our long term relationship but technically this is my partner’s dog and the other is mine. We individually had them before our relationship. So, they are our own separate responsibilities (like handling vet appts, cost, etc separately). His dog can not be in a car AT ALL without extreme whining, barking, etc. He has also tried to crawl in the front seat with us before which definitely feels like a safety concern because he is 60+ lbs. Our previous vet prescribed us meds to help keep him calm during trips, vet appts, and other situational things. 

We moved within the past few months and have not established a vet for our dogs yet. We are out of his meds and have been for 4 months. I have broken my own boundaries by reminding him multiple times over the past 2months to schedule a vet appt so we can get the prescription refilled.

We live with her so since my mom works all the time I’m pretty much the only one who’s home with my grandma all day. I do online school so I make my own schedule. Lately my mom has not been doing anything to help around the house or with my grandma and it’s exhausting because I’m trying to finish my last year of high school and doing everything. I feel very neglected because my mom comes home and barely talks to me. She only talks to me to yell at me about my grades.( I’m an all a student). I just want some help taking care of my grandma and stuff around the house. I also just want my mom back. AITA for asking her to stay home and help me with things?,0.0,-0.0015610505,0,1
26,1ct0fuf,WIBTA for telling my coworkers I have a disease I don't ,"I am a 26 year old Trans man. I have been on hormones for 4 years and have top Surgery scheduled for August (Yay!) the thing is I'm completely stealth at my new job. I started this year and to them I am just a flamboyant cis dude. 

I took a week off and mentioned it was for Surgery because I won't be able to lift anything heavy for a while after and needed to let my boss know, now it's gotten around that I'm having surgery (Annoying but I'll live) the issue is people keep asking if I'm okay and want to know what surgery im getting. 

I've said it's a shoulder thing and I'm fine but there is this one coworker that just won't drop it. She did the same thing when my mum was sick, I think she just really likes drama. I've said I'm not comfortable talking about it and honestly have half a mind to report her but I kind of want to mess with her.

So would I be an asshole if I told her it's like a benign tumor or something? Or like a genetic heart/lung issue. I know if I keep telling her to drop it I'll eventually get annoyed enough to snap at her and that will reflect poorly on me, and I feel like taking it to management or HR will just create a poor environment because she'll get stroppy. I'll tell someone for sure but honestly I want to take her down a peg so I think I would be TAH because really it's just a desire for petty revenge ",Everyone Sucks POO Mode,2024-05-16,"WIBTA for telling my coworkers I have a disease I don't  I am a 26 year old Trans man.

27,1ct0ezh,AITA for saying my friend wasn’t alone while her cat passed?,"A few days ago my friend called my work with an emergency with her very elderly cat. Her mom was out of town and she doesn’t drive or have anyone else in the area. I left work (getting an attendance point because I didn’t have PTO but frankly that wasn’t my concern) and rushed over to her so I could take her and the cat to the emergency vet. My friend is quite a bit younger than I am and just didn’t have as much experience as well as being really stressed so I called her mom to explain what was going on, explained everything to the vet, communicated what the vet said to her mom and ultimately made the decision to let the cat go. We sat with her while she passed and I held my friend until she said she was ready to go. 


I was over at their house once the mom came home and she said she was so sorry the daughter was “all alone” dealing with all of this. I said simply “I tried to make sure she wasn’t all alone- jay, or the kitty- but I’m so sorry that it all went down the way it did and if there is anything else I can do please let me know” 


A family friend at the table jumped in and said that if she felt alone she was alone and that’s what matters. I said I absolutely was not trying to disregard how she felt and I i absolutely shouldn’t have mentioned anything about how I was feeling. I apologized and we moved on with the service. 

Later the family friend walked up to me and told me she was disappointed that I tried to make it all about me and I should be ashamed. She said all I did was “drive the car and hold her hand” which “doesn’t matter.” I didn’t mention the money or anything else because frankly that doesn’t matter. 

I felt taken aback but once again apologized for anything I said that came across wrong as it wasn’t my intention however I understand it was out of line and genuinely apologize. This person huffed and told me that “kids your age know nothing” before stalking away. 

I ended up giving my friend a hug with the keepsake I made from a picture I took and the footprint they gave us and told her if she needed anything to text me day or night. She told me thank you, that she appreciated me, I was her only real friend and I left. 

I went home and found the family friend I talked to made a Facebook post for the memorial mentioning how my friend was “suffering alone” with “no support around” but managed to “pull through in the most difficult time of her life and do what she needed”.

28,1ct0cl2,AITA for not fixing the TV?,"This happened a few minutes ago.
I had a really stressful day and i was resting for a bit.
I was on the TV room using my phone and i heard my dad coming in:

- Hey, hows going?
+ Not much, theres a soccer match going on and im gonna watch it

As soon as he turns on the TV he presses the button for voice commands and dictates the channel to the TV, TV says “this is not possible right now”, he does it again and the TV responds the same way.
At this point i look at him and ask:

- Did you try using the buttons?
+ They are not working, the remote is not working 
(I’ve been looking at him and he didn’t try using the buttons)

At this point i grab the remote and i tell him:

- Let me try to fix it

I try the change channel button, the TV says not possible, volume? Not possible, i touch the home button and it works, change the device and go back to the cable, check again? Doesn’t work…
Through this whole process he is just staring at me like im a tech support guy and yelling because i cant fix the TV.
I just stood up, gave him the remote and say:

- If you are gonna act like that, do it yourself

I leave the room and next thing i know is that he is still yelling about idk what, he goes down and turns on the other TV while he keeps yelling at me because i didn’t fix the problem, so i calmly said:

- You started yelling at me
+ Yeah but i asked you to fix the TV and you didn’t 
(I tried to fix it myself with out him asking me to)
- Yeah, and you started yelling at me
+ Shut up, dumbass

At this point im really upset, its the first time he calls me a dumbass and it was just because i couldn’t fix the TV, then my mom comes in my room and tells me i was wrong for not fixing the TV, so, AITA?

TDLR; I tried to fix the TV and left because he started yelling at me, he called me dumbass because of it and also my mom told me i was wrong for not fixing it.

Well, recently, (November 9th, 2023)... my stepdad had an episode of rage. He had flipped out on me over a tool he couldn't find. He only got angrier when i said i dont know..

31,1ct041c,AITA for telling my mom that she isn't a mom to me?,"I just got into an argument with my mom over my cousins and told her I didn't consider her a mom anymore.. We got into an argument because a couple years ago we all had a falling out about certain incidents that had happened between all of us, and we were way younger. For context, in 2016 my grandma died, and we moved in with my cousins and my aunt and my uncle. My uncles first daughter is from another marriage he had a couple years back and she lived most of the time with her mom. Her step dads son had inappropiatly touched her multiple times.And told her that “this is how you show someone that you love them”. She loved her siblings so using that she committed the same acts against them with the same reasoning, and when we moved in, they continued that with us. The oldest daughter (K) was 12. Me (A) and her younger brother(I), were around the age of 10. My cousin's younger sister(M) was 9 and my younger brother (IL) was 7. Therefore, we had no idea what exactly we were doing when this all was going on. A bunch of fighting happened and we moved out and no one knew of the incidents except for us kids. Eventually we all got back and started talking again in 2019 and they moved in with us because they had been homeless for a while. After they moved in, a bunch of arguments were happening and it got to my parents that something had happened years ago. I didn’t exactly explain in depth what happened. All my parents know was that some kind of activity went on that was very inappropriate. We all lost contact with each other because of multiple reasons. Recently I (now 17) got back in contact with my older cousin(K), and she had told me how a lot of things have changed, and I should try and hear them out. And what she had said was true. My uncle and my cousin were both in therapy, getting the help they needed. And nothing else inappropriate was going on and I had known that we had all grown from the situation because we were just kids and we were all now over the age of 12. And we understood what we did was wrong and we wouldn't do it ever again. I've been in contact with them for about a year now and my mom does not agree with me. She tries to put her opinion in and we get into arguments a lot about it all the time. My mom recently brought up that I apparently support them when I know that there's still stuff going on down there, but she refuses to talk to my aunt or my uncle or try and get the details of what actually happened. I told her that she needs to let it go and that she's holding on to it because she doesn't like my uncle and my aunt for multiple reasons as they've had arguments.

33,1ct02ty,AITA for making a sandwich instead of eating the dinner my stepfather made?,"I (15f) am plus sized. It runs in our family as well as diabetes. I got bullied in school relentlessly to the point I am now homeschooled, having panic attacks if I even pass by the school. The memories are too much for me. Due to the bullying I have a rocky relationship with food, I don’t eat anything other than dinner (because I’m forced to), and I won’t eat at a friends house or in public period.

Tonight I decided that I didn’t want to eat the dinner that was prepared by my stepdad (54m) as it was just too much for me and I knew I wouldn’t eat most of it. (I didn’t want to go another night getting yelled at for not eating all my food that he plated for me.) Instead I made a sandwich, something I was more comfortable eating than the pork, peas, and pasta salad. I planned on cutting the sandwich in half and saving the other half for something else. When I finished preparing it I was about to grab a knife to cut it. 

A little background on my stepdad, he’s a recovering alcoholic and has been emotionally and mentally abusive towards me since he started dating my mom (50f). My mother is a narcissist. So, whenever I’m doing something in the kitchen with food (due to the times he’s harassed me for “eating too much” when I haven’t even put anything more than a small scoop of mashed potato’s on a plate) I freeze if I hear footsteps. 

He walked in and looked me up and down from where I was frozen in place, he looked disgusted. “You don’t think that’s a little much?” He eyed the sandwich I had made (two slices of ham, cheese, and salami).

“Maybe…) I was scared so I muttered it, he got angrier.

“Why did you make this? I made dinner!” He was red in the face, he looked like he was trying not to yell at me.

“I didn’t want it…” I didn’t look at him in the eyes, I was shaking, afraid.

“I want you to take half of that off and put it away, you don’t need to eat all of that, it’s a waste of good food!” Then he stormed out, going upstairs to complain to my mother (who works from home) about how horrible and ungrateful I am or whatever. 

This put me off eating at all so I bagged the sandwich and put it in the fridge then went to my room. Now I’m starting to think I should have just eaten what he made because I feel like I hurt his feelings. Am I the asshole?",No A-holes here,2024-05-16,"AITA for making a sandwich instead of eating the dinner my stepfather made? I (15f) am plus sized. It runs in our family as well as diabetes. I got bullied in school relentlessly to the point I am now homeschooled, having panic attacks if I even pass by the school. The memories are too much for me. Due to the bullying I have a rocky relationship with food, I don’t eat anything other than dinner (because I’m forced to), and I won’t eat at a friends house or in public period.

Tonight I decided that I didn’t want to eat the dinner that was prepared by my stepdad (54m) as it was just too much for me and I knew I wouldn’t eat most of it. (I didn’t want to go another night getting yelled at for not eating all my food that he plated for me.) Instead I made a sandwich, something I was more comfortable eating than the pork, peas, and pasta salad. I planned on cutting the sandwich in half and saving the other half for something else. When I finished preparing it I was about to grab a knife to cut it. 

A little background on my stepdad, he’s a recovering alcoholic and has been emotionally and mentally abusive towards me since he started dating my mom (50f). My mother is a narcissist. So, whenever I’m doing something in the kitchen with food (due to the times he’s harassed me for “eating too much” when I haven’t even put anything more than a small scoop of mashed potato’s on a plate) I freeze if I hear footsteps. 

He walked in and looked me up and down from where I was frozen in place, he looked disgusted. “You don’t think that’s a little much?” He eyed the sandwich I had made (two slices of ham, cheese, and salami).

“Maybe…) I was scared so I muttered it, he got angrier.

“Why did you make this? I made dinner!” He was red in the face, he looked like he was trying not to yell at me.

“I didn’t want it…” I didn’t look at him in the eyes, I was shaking, afraid.

“I want you to take half of that off and put it away, you don’t need to eat all of that, it’s a waste of good food!” Then he stormed out, going upstairs to complain to my mother (who works from home) about how horrible and ungrateful I am or whatever. 

This put me off eating at all so I bagged the sandwich and put it in the fridge then went to my room. Now I’m starting to think I should have just eaten what he made because I feel like I hurt his feelings. Am I the asshole?",4.0,-0.0014526744,0,0
34,1ct0108,WIBTA if I named my son Avery,"My husband and I are expecting a baby boy and are trying to decide on a baby name. I’ve always loved the name Avery (fake name) and before my husband and I were even married we talked about baby names and I said I loved that name for a kid. He said he did too and it happened to be a family name so it was a win win. The real name has a lot of positive associations for both of us. We both agreed and said if we ever had a boy we’d name him Avery.

A few years later when his sister was pregnant and we were visiting, she asked us if we’d ever thought of any baby names and we mentioned Avery. My MIL overheard and gasped. Apparently, her father (who has passed) named Avery, had gone by Abe because he had a negative association with the name since his own father was named Avery and was abusive in some way. We had no idea about this until my MIL mentioned it and it seems most others in the family didn’t know either. Both my husbands grandpa Abe and great grandpa Avery passed before my husband was born.

Well I’m pregnant now and my husband and I both can’t get the name out of our heads. Maybe our bad for thinking it could be our future kid’s name for so long. But while there’s a million other names out there we really love that name and are really struggling to separate from it.

We might be the assholes for wanting to keep the name when it clearly has a negative association, at least to my mother in law, and we don’t want our kids name to have a stigma.

36,1cszy8d,AITA for wanting to be buried with my sister?,"
My 20 year old sister passed away in March of last year. She was buried directly behind our paternal grandfather (and when she passes our grandmother). My paternal aunts will be buried in the plots side by side to their parents. My parents bought the two plots on either side of my sister. 

The plan right now is my dad will be on one side and my mom on the other. My maternal grandmother will be buried with my mom (one casket + two things of ashes can be buried in one grave in our cemetery). 

Our older sister will be buried with little sister.

So basically my parents, both sisters and 3/4 grandparents and two aunts will be buried in the same place. I want to too when the day comes. I’m only 22 but I don’t care if it takes 70 years.

My dad is against adding me directly to my little sister’s stone as of right now, which I agree with. We are finally able to look into grave stones after her funeral costs so we have been discussing it more lately. 

But I said “we can always do it later” and he kept on insisting I can only do it after I get married because my future husband might not want to be buried there and want to share a grave with me in a different plot or cemetery all together. 

I get what he is saying. I do. And I would not make the final decision for a few years at least.  But here’s the thing I’m single right now, and I wouldn’t mind being buried in the plot directly behind my sister(s) grave if my future husband wanted to be buried there as well (which I can purchase it if it want to). But if he doesn’t want to be buried there then I’ll insist to be cremated and some ashes go into the grave my sisters are/ will be one day. And some with my future spouse or for my future children to have. 

My dad will end up being buried with 2 of his children (all 3 if I’m buried there) his wife, parents, MIL and sisters, he also has a brother but I’m not sure about him as he lives in Europe. I want to be buried with my family. My mom’s two sisters are divorced and so are my maternal grandparents. There is always a chance I get divorced or something. If I’m buried with my family I’ll always know I’m with people who love me I am not sure about the future and who I will end up marrying. 

My dad says i shouldn’t do anything until I’m married. 

AITA if I end up choosing this before I get married like according to my dad?
