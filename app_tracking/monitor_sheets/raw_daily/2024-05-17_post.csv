0,1cugjwa,AITA for saying I'm not wearing a black dress to my Grandma's funeral?,"I, 21M, am a well passing trans man. I'm tall, relatively muscular, short hair and just overall guy-looking. My Grandma passed away recently, and had Alzheimers for quite some time before she died. She often used to not recognise me or ask my mum where \[my deadname\] was when I was right there. She would sometimes say she'd love to see me again and it was overall painful for the whole family. Before I came out gran used to love picking out dresses for me, and afterwards she moved onto suits.

But when she started forgetting stuff she kept talking about what kind of dresses I like now,  what she should get for me, etc. The funeral's next week and I mentioned that I would probably wear the last suit she got for me which was black and a vest just for extra blackness. My cousin looked at me like I'd just said the most ridiculous thing on the planet and she said, 'no, gran would have wanted to see you in a dress' and how I could disrespect her very wishes on such an occasion and what an asshole I am for putting my needs over hers when its her funeral.

I didn't quite know how to respond to that and luckily I was saved by her kids who started making a mess so she went after them. I frankly, think she's being fucking ridiculous. I couldn't pass as a girl if I tried anymore, much less fit into one of my old dresses. I think it would be utterly disrespectful if I showed up in a dress, it would look far too ridiculous/comical for a funeral. 

I'm 99.99999999999999% sure I'm not the asshole. I'm genuinely just no longer the build to be in a dress, I'm a grown man, it would be a joke. But just in case I'm missing something, AITA?

2,1cu3r5v,AITA for wanting to still go to my families vacation even if my partner can’t afford it,"Context here, I am a 21 female, and I have been with my 21 non-binary partner for almost 2 years. I genuinely love my partner and they make me feel loved, I’m not looking for advice into my relationship. As any normal lgbt couple, we are currently living together in a house. We have our own mortgage and everything. 

We were planning to take two trips this summer, one in July for the two of us in San Diego over their birthday to celebrate. I have paid for everything so far, that’s not to say I am upset about paying for everything, but that I think it’s an important fact to bring up. 

My mom planned a trip in August for us to go to Tennessee with my family, and as per usual that invite was extended to my partner as my family genuinely cares for my partner and our relationship. With that being said, she planned the trip to start on a monday and end on a friday, which is impossible for my partner to make with their current job. And I have totally thought about my partner just taking off, but their job only gives them vacation days and all of it is being used for our vacation in July, and for my partner to take off she would have to go unpaid, which for us is financially not a decision we can make. 

Edit: I understand it was unclear where the money came from for this trip, travel and stay is being covered by my mom, which includes my partner. It's just them taking unpaid time off that creates the financial dilemma. This was not without discussion, we did try to figure ways for them to save to go and etc.  

We briefly talked about it, and they agreed that we wouldn’t be able to make it. I got upset initially because they didn’t even suggest I go by myself, as my mom is my boss, and gave me 2 weeks of vacation time paid. I accept partial assholeness for not communicating my feelings right then and there. The next day, we get up to start getting ready for work, but I was still totally bummed out and they called me out. I tried to remain pretty light but I ended up being honest by saying I was hoping they would accept me going by myself. They sat down and started by saying I could go by myself but that would make them feel bad for not being able to afford being off, and having to stay home.

The conversation didn’t go much farther than what was said, as uncomfortable silence filled the room. We both started shedding tears, but they had to go to work. We plan to connect after we get off to talk more. I completely understand their feelings but I just recently started making efforts to not let my empathy for others allow me to be a doormat.

3,1ctvmeh,AITA for believing my boyfriend is way too close with his mom?,"I (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have only been dating for around 2 months now, but I've known him since the 7th grade. My concern is that he is way too close with his mom. I need to give context by explaining that his relationship with his mom is different from that of other males, and that's okay, because he lost his dad when he was very young. So it naturally makes sense that he would have an even closer and special bond with his mom and I respect that. I never had a problem with her at first (she used to take me out to family lunch and stuff), but ever since he and I started growing closer I have been noticing behaviors I'm not sure I'm okay with?

She is constantly asking him where he is, at all times, and needing him to check in with her during dates. I understand we're teenagers and it's his mom's car he's driving, but the constant need of location (even though she has Life360 which allows her to check) is getting on my nerves. He always has to ask for permission to go anywhere, and oftentimes when he asks he is afraid of the response he'll get because he might be asking ""too much"" in which she might go off on him. He is usually on eggshells when around her, and she almost always forbids him from doing typical, normal stuff if she deems it ""unsafe"". She eased a lot of my worries a while ago and explained how she will not be a ""monster-in-law"", and that as time goes on and we progress as adults she will slowly loosen the reins on the relationship. I get it, but things still haven't sat well with me since.

She hates it when we call for long periods of time, even if she got attention during the day, and will ""explode"" on him for not giving her enough time. My boyfriend swears he is not her only source of attention (after all he has brother/grandparents living under one roof), yet he also told me she doesn't really have any friends. We only go on dates once per weekend (if that), and he is home a lot with her. So I don't understand why she needs so much time. His excuse is she has no husband. Another thing is she seems to give him ""free will"" by allowing him choices to make, but then guilts him when he picks the one she doesn't want. They are also very touchy which each other (not in a creepy way I just find it off-putting considering all these factors together) which my boyfriend has argued is simply his way of connecting with people because he's a touchy person. My boyfriend swears that he has healthy boundaries and a healthy relationship with his mom, and she swears the same. He often compares it to my relationship with my sister, who is my best friend and who I'm close with. I personally think that's different because not only are we the same gender, she also isn't a parent and she respects my boundaries 100%.

**I want to know, am I overreacting?** Multiple of his friends agree that his mom is overbearing, but he does not think so-- or at least he won't address the problem with her.

4,1ctvlf2,WIBTAH If I Refuse to do What my Mom is Asking me rn,"Alright, so since this is my first time posting here, I might have some issues with objectivity in my post, but I'll endeavor to do my best. I apologize if this post is not relevant to this subreddit.

Here's the rundown:

My mom wants me (16M) to to take a specific job. Basically, we have a modest sized religious community growing at a nice pace in our area, and my mom wants me to volunteer as a teacher's assistant for their summer camp, which would have me go mondays through thursdays for basically the entire summer from around 9 something AM to 1 something PM.

All of their paid slots have been filled, meaning they most likely have met the requirements for what they need for the camp to function. I know the kids in this community, and the younger kids are, invariably, *menaces.* I have lived here for well over a year, and *every single kid* is a troublemaker. Being only 16, I already know that I would be run ragged trying to supervise and direct these kids. Now, if it was just for a few weeks, then I might have agreed. But not the whole summer.

In an effort to sweeten the deal, my mom offered to pay me herself. I was hesitantly willing to work if it brought money to the house, but the paid positions have filled already. And not only would I just be taking money from the house, I *wouldn't spend it.* All of my friends are casual friends- I gladly call them my friends, but despite the various circumstances we are in, I have never, and probably will never take them out to eat or treat them. I just turned 16, so I don't have a license yet, and I don't even have a phone to use apps to pay for things. So I would be limited to carrying cash around and going to places within biking distance.

My dad works full time, but he cooks for us pretty regularly and his food is great, so I wouldn't be spending money on food. My mom hates the idea of spending on videogames. Aside from those two things, I don't have much else to spend on.

So I wouldn't be spending the money that she's giving me while doing something I don't want to do.

Not only that, but I was looking forward to resting this summer. Throughout the school year, I have been taking college classes despite being in 10th grade, attending those classes on campus and getting good grades. I was looking forward to having no High School and just 1 or 2 college classes over the summer, using the rest of my time to just relax and do what I wanted. I am ahead on my education and generally a very obedient kid, but I just hate the idea of doing what she's suggesting.

However, on her side of the argument she's trying to teach me that I will have to do things in life that I don't want to, she wants me to have experience doing a job of any sort, and she already promised my help to her friends.

I have already told her repeatedly that I don't want to do it and avoided signing up with excuses so far, but that won't last forever.

So, would I be the asshole if I dug my heels in and just point blank refused, or would I be justified?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"WIBTAH If I Refuse to do What my Mom is Asking me rn Alright, so since this is my first time posting here, I might have some issues with objectivity in my post, but I'll endeavor to do my best.

6,1ctv8c5,AITA for going to a party without a friend that had been excited to go on prom night?,"On prom night, three of my friends (let’s call them Ally, Emma, and Katy) and I made a plan to meet up at a nearby 7/11 in order to drive to an after-party together. Ally, Katy, and I drove to the 7/11 in one car, while Emma went with her boyfriend in another.

It's approximately 12:30 a.m. when the three of us arrive at 7/11, and Emma is nowhere to be found. We wait a few minutes before checking her location, where we see she’s in an empty parking lot (with her bf). There have been situations previously where we’ve made plans to hang out with her, and she hangs out with her boyfriend instead (with no communication), so we were irritated. She hadn’t texted us or told us she was making any pit stops, so we assumed she wasn’t going to show up at all. We wouldn’t have left when we did, but parties can be time-sensitive, and the one we were going to was 30 minutes away. So, we called and texted her (and got no response), sending her the location of the party and telling her we were going to head there without her.

Twenty minutes into our drive, she calls, mad, asking us why we would leave her. We tell her we texted her earlier to inform her of our departure and explain we could have missed the party if we didn’t leave when we did. We then told her she could ask her boyfriend to drive her or drive herself, but she claimed he had a curfew and had to go home/didn’t want to go by herself before hanging up the phone. At this point, we feel bad but are almost at the party, so we decide to go anyway.

We aren’t at the party for more than 30 minutes before heading back and deciding to find Emma. We check her location and see she’s at the park we usually go to late at night every weekend. We pull up to the park nearing 2 a.m. and see her doing something inappropriate with her boyfriend in his car, which was especially surprising considering she said he had to go home over an hour ago.

We feel bad, not meaning to embarrass her/invade her privacy and drive away. A few minutes later we get a text from her saying she’s going home.  (We were supposed to sleepover that night.) Ally said we should follow her home to talk to her, so we did.

When we get to her house and get out of the car, she comes outside her house and starts screaming in all of our faces over the fact that we left her “knowing how much she wanted to be there,” even though she was the one who didn’t stick to the OG plan. We still apologized and tried to calm her down. 

I thought that would be the end of the argument, but it has since escalated and I haven’t spoken to Emma OR Ally in days, due to a plethora of reasons that have arisen because of this situation.

I know we should have waited at the 7/11 longer, but Emma still refuses to take any of the blame for the decisions made that night.

We aren’t at the party for more than 30 minutes before heading back and deciding to find Emma. We check her location and see she’s at the park we usually go to late at night every weekend. We pull up to the park nearing 2 a.m. and see her doing something inappropriate with her boyfriend in his car, which was especially surprising considering she said he had to go home over an hour ago.

We feel bad, not meaning to embarrass her/invade her privacy and drive away. A few minutes later we get a text from her saying she’s going home.  (We were supposed to sleepover that night.) Ally said we should follow her home to talk to her, so we did.

When we get to her house and get out of the car, she comes outside her house and starts screaming in all of our faces over the fact that we left her “knowing how much she wanted to be there,” even though she was the one who didn’t stick to the OG plan. We still apologized and tried to calm her down. 

I thought that would be the end of the argument, but it has since escalated and I haven’t spoken to Emma OR Ally in days, due to a plethora of reasons that have arisen because of this situation.

I know we should have waited at the 7/11 longer, but Emma still refuses to take any of the blame for the decisions made that night. AITA?",0.0,0.068139076,0,1

8,1ctv039,AITA for asking my wife if I can send her most of my paycheck to save it for us,"I (35M) struggle saving money. I lack impulse control when I spend, and I generally have poor financial habits. I have a growth mindset around this and I’m constantly trying to fix my deficits and financial situation/status. There has been improvement (my wife thinks so too) but it’s been a slow process.

My wife (33F) and I have been married two and a half years and together for 5. Being married, my finances affect her as well.

About a year ago, I asked my wife what she thinks about me direct depositing most of my paycheck to her so we can save for our future (I would only keep a predetermined amount for groceries and other daily life expenses). The reason for this suggestion was because even with my improvements I felt I ultimately lacked control and didn’t fully trust myself to save on my own.

My wife wasn’t comfortable with the idea at the time because she felt like it wasn’t her responsibility and that I should work on my financial habits in a way that leads to more permanent changes. It’s been about a year now, and she’s more amenable to the idea now because I haven’t been reaching my savings goals.

I respect my wife’s position and feelings about the situation. My frustration is that while I agree it isn’t her responsibility, I felt like I was asking for help to improve our marriage finances while being transparent about where I think I stand. To me, my suggestion wasn’t an ideal solution but rather a temporary solution while I continue to work on myself. I respect her position but I thought she took a bit of a hardline and I was hoping for more of a partnership/some help since we’re in this together. Again, not her responsibility, just a nice to have I suppose.

9,1ctuzi5,"AITA for Not Letting Conversation Stagnate and ""Talking Over"" My Friend?","All names present are false...

I (M25) am part of a group of friends who have kept in touch since High School. We've kept some level of contact through College and the start of our careers, and we meet up at least every few weeks (more often, every few days).

The issue is my friend Tate (F27). We all have our own social circles, obviously, but at least focus on the friend group when we get together. Tate doesn't. She ignores the people right in front of her in favor of whoever she's texting, and stalls the conversation and lets it stagnate so she can text her other friends while also having our attention.

What I mean by this is, she'll be looking at her phone and bring something up that's going on with her, and then stop mid-sentence. She won't talk for a good minute or 2, having a back-and-forth on her phone, and then start all over again and get maybe another few words into what she's talking about before doing it all over again. A 30 second anecdote about going to see the new Avatar movie and liking the new AMP suits will turn into 5 or 10 minutes of her stopping and starting.

No one will interrupt her, or talk about something else of substance, because that'd be rude. But I think she's being incredibly disrespectful in the first place for not just... getting it over with.

So... I stopped giving a shit about being rude. 

Whenever she stops like that recently, I've been moving on to talk about something completely different. I've done this the last three times we've all gotten together, and most of the others in the group have started doing the same. We only get to see each other a couple hours a week, after all, and we shouldn't have to give a substantial amount of those few hours to silence so someone can send tiktoks to someone not there or argue with someone over who should bring what to their work's cookout.

Well, it's apparently pissed Tate off, because my friend Kate (26F) showed up to our last dinner (we went to this new SEA restaurant in the area, it's really good) without Tate - who she gives a ride - and told us Tate feels like she's being excluded and doesn't want to hang out while it's happening, because we've been ""talking over"" her a lot. 

Kate, for reference, was one of the first people to also start keeping shit rolling. Our friends Robert (26M) and Josh (25M), however, think we're being assholes and should just stop so things can get back to how they've been for years because ""that's how she's always been"". Robert thinks that, if it's upsetting her enough that she isn't showing up, it must be something more than being ""talked over"", and we should be more patient with her.

I hate waste. Less is more. I’m not picky about prices, but I won’t buy more than I need. Even as a kid.

My BF, on the other hand, holds onto sentimental items, including things from his exes. His mom told me how he would show off the simpliest gift to friends and family. When he moved in, he decided to bring just his clothes and left his exes' gifts at his mom’s.

When we started, the first thing I bought him was a new pair of gym shoes because his were really old. He used them for a few weeks before buying a new pair, leaving mine forgotten. He also asked for me to gift him a jacket of mine. He used it a few weeks before leaving it forgotten in my car, my brother found it and asked for it. My BF didn’t notice it was gone until 4 months later. He also asked me to buy him certain adult toys, which we used for a few days before they were forgotten. I got mad about the pattern and threw them away. He got upset about it and promised he would use the replacement more, but 6mths later, it’s still unpacked.

My BF is a huge Taylor Swift fan. When she announced her new album, he was over the moon. He’s never had any original Taylor Swift merchandise because of his $$, so I decided to surprise him. I bought the most expensive vinyl in the store and some other items as a gift. He found out about it by mistake and was thrilled. I was happy to see him so excited.

The items arrived in April. Days passed, and he left the things on the bed in my son’s room, unpackaged. When my son came over, I had to move them elsewhere.

I asked him what he planned to do with the stuff, and he said he was thinking about it. The items started to gather dust, so I bought new furniture for the living room for him to display his collection. But nothing happened. The furniture arrived two weeks ago and is collecting dust. I tried to arrange them on the furniture, but he got mad, saying he wanted to decide how and where to put them. I’m tired of seeing them just lying around. I told him that if he doesn’t decide soon, I’ll either sell them or throw them away. To me, they’re just becoming garbage, and I can’t stand it.

He told me that IWBTA if I did that, but to me, it already feels like a waste of money.

So WIBTA?

EDIT: I have Mild OCD, that's why I need everything in order. He moved in 3 months ago and he was the one who decided to go to his mother when my son comes (neither I or my exwife have any issue with him bondign with my son). In his house there are left just books and his exes letters and stuffed animals, he decided left those there. We have bought things as a couple for ours to use in our home. He can change things at the apartment just fine, he is the one who changed our bedroom setting, also the living room, and he decided on colors for the bathroom, I don't make a fuss about it, we have had no issue with any of that.",Asshole,2024-05-17,"WIBTA if I throw away or sell my boyfriend's gift?

11,1ctukdk,AITA for telling my mother she couldn't attend my graduation with a stranger?,"I realize the title could push a very one-sided version of the story, so here's some context:

I (18F) am graduating next week. I've been really excited about this for a long time (as my 8th grade graduation was effectively canceled by Covid, and have therefore had a very clear idea in my head of what the events leading up to it, as well as the actual day, would be like. I have also known that the guest room in our house was going to be occupied by one of my mother's colleagues/distant relatives -- let's call him Jack. I don't remember ever meeting Jack, and I definitely don't feel like I know him in the slightest, though my mother says he has stayed in our house before, around 7-8 years ago.

Two days ago, I was celebrating an award with my family when the topic of Jack was brought up, this time with the added idea that they wanted to bring John to my senior dinner. I said I felt no reason for him to be there, as his plane would land just before the dinner, I didn't know who he was, and we had already RSVP'd spots for all three of my family members. My father agreed, and my mother didn't bring it up again.

Until today. This morning, my mother told me she wanted Jack to go to my senior dinner, forgetting I’d mentioned I didn't want him there. My mother asked why, finding that since the ""host allowed, I should too."" I said that since she has a habit of completely ignoring/brushing me aside when she brings colleagues to these events, and again, I don’t know him, I still didn't want him attending. I continued, rhetorically asking if he was going to bring me to my graduation, too. She said yes. I told my father that she wanted to bring this guy to graduation, and he agreed that she would likely make the event about him, and that it was weird she brought it up again.

When she got home, I mentioned it again, in a fairly angry tone (as we had already discussed his non-attendance two days prior), and said that since I didn't know this guy, I didn't want him there. She claimed that since he was going to NC only to visit us (and that the talk he was giving at the nearby university and the subsequent dinner with the dean were purely coincidental), he should be able to come. I reiterated that since I didn’t know the guy, he could not attend. I also gave an ultimatum -- either she could come without him, or she can't come at all. She said she would rather not attend. I was shocked and angry, and asked (in a moment of teenage dramatics) if ""she really cared about him more than me."" She said yes. I lashed out at her, yelling that I couldn't believe they would really rather him be there than come to my graduation without someone I've never met.

AITA for not wanting him there? Was I being too dramatic with the ultimatum, even though I also know that my ultimatum ultimately meant nothing, as I now know that my mother will attend with Jack whether I agreed he should be there or not.

UPDATE: sorry guys, i caved. i said my mother and jack could come, under three stipulations — “1. you must make a conscious effort to not just talk to him in chinese the whole time and actually pay attention to what i’m doing. if you just want to talk to him, go get coffee or something. waiting for me to get a something ive waited eight years for is not. the. time.

2. you don’t make any ’god it was my work/genes that got her here‘ or any other jokes where you take credit for my accomplishments — they are almost painfully unfunny.

3. we take more pictures without him then with him. i couldn’t care less if he’s your twin brother, he does not live with me, and therefore the pictures i have in twenty years from my one and only high school graduation will not have him in them. because you know him, you can navigate the conversation of kicking him out of the pictures.”

  
To be honest, I’d rather have an (albeit distant) family member at my graduation than having this damage my mother and I’d relationship to such an extreme degree — we’re both equally stubborn (unstoppable force vs. immovable object) and this is a level of event where I’d rather just cave. To be clear, i’m still very angry at her, but I’ll let Jack come in part so he can see this for whatever reason (I still don’t actually even know if he wanted to come in the first place, or if my mother just said hey wanna do this), and so my mother can still come to one of my first major life events.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"AITA for telling my mother she couldn't attend my graduation with a stranger?

I love my parents dearly but I don't want them to be involved.  I know myself that when I am stressed and my parents are around, their presence exacerbates my mood and I struggle not to be irritable and snappish, which I then feel guilty about.

In this case, it'll be me and my choices that are causing them upset and stressed,  and I don't think I'd have the emotional  capacity around the surgery to be in any state to deal with managing that. For all that it is major surgery, for me this is a really important step in being happier, and I couldn't be more delighted it's happening.

I know myself that when I am stressed and my parents are around, their presence exacerbates my mood and I struggle not to be irritable and snappish, which I then feel guilty about. I also am aware that when they are stressed or upset, I try overly hard to take the role of de escalator, focusing on calming things down or making them feel less upset. In this case, it'll be me and my choices that are causing them upset and stressed,  and I don't think I'd have the emotional  capacity around the surgery to be in any state to deal with managing that. For all that it is major surgery, for me this is a really important step in being happier, and I couldn't be more delighted it's happening. 

I've no idea how to but I'm going to have to tell them eventually and they're probably going to be hurt. In their mind, they'll be offering support to their child at a difficult time, only to be snubbed and left on the sidelines.

13,1ctu45e,AITA for telling my HS senior to go get a job and contribute?,"I'm a single mom of 3 who works full-time. My oldest's other ""parent"" went MIA and I haven't gotten financial help for her in 3 years now. 

She's starting college in the Fall. She's gotten a small merit scholarship so far, but with the FAFSA disaster, we're still not sure what other support, if any, is going to come through. I'm planning to help her with tuition so she can graduate from college debt-free, or almost. 
She wanted to live on campus... but we live only 15-20 minutes away and it doesn't make sense to pay for housing. Sure, she's likely going to need a car to get there (public transportation is not the best despite the proximity), but said car can also be used to get herself to a job.
The end of senior HS year has a million activities and trips, all pricey. I find it soooo excessive. I told her to choose wisely because I'd only pay for a few select ones, and yet she's constantly been trying to get more and more. She also wants to go out and eat out every weekend, and away on vacation. 🙄 I already bought her the concert tickets she wanted as a graduation present.

I told her a few months ago she should start looking for a job on the weekend/after school for now and when she starts college --other than her current non-paying 4-hour internship on Saturdays. Not only for pocket money, but also to help with college and the cost of a 2nd car. She has a job for 5 weeks this summer (the same as the past 3 years), but it's only 3 hours a day. I anticipate she'll make roughly $1,400 and has plans to blow it all off quickly.

I just can't seem to get it through to her that money doesn't fall from the sky. It's frustrating because I'm frugal, live a minimalist lifestyle, and am really good at budgeting and managing money. Although I certainly remember not having such a good sense of the cost of living as a teenager/young adult, I feel she's next level. I've been trying to teach her for many years, without success. (Her other parent was the complete opposite, and I kinda feel like we live in a community that has lots of entitled, loaded brats.)

So, WIBTA if I gave her a sort of ultimatum to get her priorities straight and start experiencing what it means to have responsibilities? Should I require her to save part of her summer income to pay for her college expenses? 
Do I let her have her last summer of semi-freedom and carefree attitude, and implement something more drastic in the Fall?

I told Ines this and she seems to understand that we just can’t afford it.

I got called in to talk to her English teacher over a paper she wrote last month. The prompt was “what I did on spring break.”

Ines spent it at home or tagging along with me to my job. But instead she wrote this ten page story about how she found this door in the office I clean that took her to the past.

She wrote a short fiction story instead of the paper her teacher wanted. She got a D.

Ines wanted me to convince the teacher to change her grade. 

I told her that she can’t submit short stories instead of homework, so she deserves that poor grade.  But Ines said that she doesn’t have anything to work with otherwise she hates English. 

We are going back and forth. She has a C in English and I told her she is grounded until she gets her grades up. 

Ines is upset and won’t speak to me. I had another meeting with a school counselor who suggests that I’m being too harsh on her, and to encourage her to write more. That’s not the problem. 

My problem is that Ines doesn’t listen to me or her teachers and acts like she’s living in that dimension in her stories. That’s not how the real world works.

Unfortunately, we are divorcing because my husband thinks I’m a terrible mom. My husband has been married twice but never had kids. 

I have two children who have been through a lot. Their late father was an alcoholic with ptsd and I stuck by his side until he died which was hard on our kids. Overall, they are good kids. They don’t get in trouble. They don’t cause trouble but neither has taken a traditional route. 

Despite my efforts, my oldest chose not to go to college, meandered around for a year after high school but is now in the military doing great. My youngest (17) isn’t in school and isn’t working. I pulled him out of school a year and a half ago and homeschooled for a year and now he’s working on getting his GED. He had a job for a little over a year when he was 15 but hasn’t worked since.Since leaving school he’s dedicated himself to learning video game design and programming. He’s getting very good at it (mostly self taught). His dream is to design and code his own game. He spends at least 8-10 hours a day doing the work or learning more about it through online resources. 

An important note is that we don’t all live in the same house. Given the challenges my children had with their father I committed to get him to 18 in our family home and he wouldn’t have to live with another father figure. Also important to note is that my husband and I got married and bought our marital home sooner than I wanted to because my husband was losing his job and was very anxious about where he was going to live, health insurance, etc.  I financed both homes and my husband doesn’t work or want for anything. 

This brings me to now. My husband is outraged that I allow my son to not work and not go to school. So outraged that he’s divorcing me unless I immediately change my gentle parenting style to be more authoritative. I’m not saying I disagree that it would be good for my son to work but I also think he just turned 17 and he’s working really hard on pursuing his dream. I just don’t see the harm in supporting that for a month or 2 more to see how far he can get.

We didn't and while I didn't get stung, my little sister (I have 3 in total) hot stung 3 times.

Okay so me (19 M) and my dad (56 M), alongside my little sisters and stepmom were driving and we were talking about a bees nest near our house. It reminded me of a story a long time ago where we went to a outside Ice Cream Parlor in the summer. My dad was insistent that we eat outside. Problem was I am a MASSIVE Mellisophobe and the parlor was swarming with bees. I begged him to let us eat in the car or take the food home. We didn't and while I didn't get stung, my little sister (I have 3 in total) hot stung 3 times.

23,1ctsnaf,WIBTA for kicking my best friend out because i’m lonely?,"AITA for not wanting to live with my best friend anymore because he’s making me feel left out and lonely?

I, 20 m, live with my best friend of the past five or six years, Leo 19 m, and recently I feel like I don’t exist to him or any of our friends anymore.

We had always been very close online and offline friends and went to school together for four years, dated for one year and then went no/low contact for several months until we made up. We’ve both lost several mutual friends but recently i’ve completely lost contact with almost all of my friends except for him and I feel like that’s just because we live together.

Before we moved in together last september, Leo lived with his partner in brighton and I would visit sometimes multiple times a week and stay over regularly, while working part time. he worked full time and always gave that as a reason why it was too much for him to come and visit me. I didn’t go over just to hang out, sometimes i’d help him with cleaning or important paperwork and we had a really close emotional bond. He was having relationship issues nearing the end of his lease and although he did stay with his partner, they did not end up moving in together as planned. 

Instead I moved out of my parents home with only a months notice so I could rent a flat, allowing him to be able to afford living in london. He pays half the utilities and a quarter of the rent, and he works full time (i think around 40 hours) and I work 50-55 hours a week. because of this and the fact that I regularly work the whole weekend we don’t often have much free time that aligns. 

We used to spend a lot more of our downtime talking or going out together but I can count on one hand the amount of times we have had a meaningful conversation in the last five months. Leo used to come into my room and we would chat for hours about absolutely nothing and everything, but now he just video calls all the people I used to be friends with and plays video games with them for hours (I am not much of a gamer). I feel pushed aside during these conversations and he often makes it clear that I am not welcome to join them, either by straight up ignoring me or telling me to leave his room. I know im not the best at messaging people to catch up but I dont think most of the people i would’ve called friends have messaged me first in the last five months, either to hang out or just to chat.

there’s a lot more to say about the situation but given the basics, do you think it would be reasonable for me to bring this up to him or am I being selfish feeling this way, especially because I dont want to live with him next year if it’s going to be like this?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"WIBTA for kicking my best friend out because i’m lonely?

Another example of her bullying is that one time when she was in town, we went to dinner with her and our friends.

So today during sixth period I was drawing this mouse and he kept erasing it and laughing about it. I told him to stop erasing my mouse and he responded with “That is not a mouse, it looks like an Aardvark” and “That isn’t even a good drawing; I could do better” (He is an artist and enjoys drawing). 

Every time he erased my drawing I kept telling him to stop and became visibly annoyed. Again he just laughed and me and found it amusing. I drew it again and I told him if he erases it, I’m going to throw his hat over the fence to the bleachers. He just laughed and said “You won’t you won’t” and “You wouldn’t do something like that.” He always wears hats and this hat in particular does not hold any personal significance to him. 

I told him that I WILL throw it and to just stop erasing my drawings. He said that if I throw it I’ll be buying him a new one and I told him I would not be paying for one. Either way after him erasing my drawings MULTIPLE times and laughing at me and me TELLING him that I’ll throw his hat if he doesn’t stop and I’m being serious. 

It comes to the last mouse drawing I made, I told him I’m being serious and to stop. So before we left he erased it and I told him that I’m going to throw it. When we walk I try to grab his hat and he moves so I say that he’s scared and knows I’ll do it. 

So he goes fine and lets me grab it and we are standing in front of the fence and we are staring at each other. He says “I trust you, I know you won’t do it” and I looked at him and said “I told you I would throw it” and then threw it over the fence. He looked at me and was shocked and kinda grabbed me and said “No now we’re going back to get my hat” and I pulled away and said “I can’t, I have my fire fighting class today and can’t be late” and he stared and me and said “That’s f**ked up” and “Why would you even do that” and I told him I would and I warned him multiple times. 

And we stared walking away and I yelled that I’ll come early tomorrow morning and get his hat, but we were already walking away and upset with each other.

First I wanna start by saying that my moms love language is definitely gift giving and mine is absolutely not. My dad who left us used to give me useless/expensive gifts and expensive/thoughless gifts sicken me. But that’s almost besides the point…

Here’s the real story:

My mom keeps buying me stuff. I think she has ADHD and we live countries away so l kinda understand compulsive buying/wanting to express care. But, mind you, I am very much a minimalist. She gets me PJs (I have a bunch), so now I need to throw some out to fit the ones she got me, she gets me stuff I do not need. I am not pleased just annoyed. 

Anyway, so I talked to her about it now that I came to visit her for the summer. I told her I Iiterally dont have space for new clothes and stuff. 

Weeks after I talked to her (and she got mad by the way and said she won’t get me anything), I asked her to sew my running shoes (they are fine just a little ripped and I wanna wait until I get to the US to get new ones. I never get to get something I like —bc someone always gives me stuff— so I was waiting until my tennis shoes were worn out bc I want to get myself something I like etc). Anyway, that was my mistake, so a week later I wake up and the first thing she says is “I got MYSELF new running shoes but if you wanna run with them… their a size 9…” 

And friends… I lost it. My moms a size 7. I said something like “then you will wear them, or you should return them, because I told you I didn’t want you to get me new shoes…” actually, I literally told her that beforehand. 

Anyway, I feel like an asshole. She got me really cute shoes, their pink bc it’s my favorite color, and now she’s wearing them. I’ve said I’d wear them (I didn’t really know she had already gotten them, I thought she like ordered them online or something). 


I feel like the worst asshole ever but idk what to do. This is such a first world problem, but I hate how annoyed I get with it and how I act.

27,1cts01s,WIBTA for sending a recorded phone call between my mom’s (50F) and I (21F) to my family? ,"** edit: recorded phone call between my mom and I 

My mom (50f) and I (22f) have never really gotten along. Love her because she’s my mom, but she’s genuinely one of the most difficult people I’ve ever met. 

Recently she has been especially difficult. I’ve been trying to maintain a good relationship with her now that she’s sober (not even because I want a relationship with her, but just want to support the sobriety for the sake of my other family members). 

She
 1) says things that aren’t true with shockingly seriously conviction 
2) yells at me constantly and then goes crying to the rest of my family that “im mean” and demands an apology. 
*i want to note here she puts me on BLAST to all of our friends and family* 

For example, she said I could stay with her during my surgery recovery. And then took it back a month before. And now is telling me I was crazy and that she never said I couldn’t stay with her. [[[[So now I’ve been desperately finding a way that my sister can come stay with me. It’s just a wreck because I actually need help to - you know-  not die for like 3 days.]]]]
           My grandma texted me and said I need to “treat my mother with a little more grace”. 

Anyways, today on the phone I could tell she was about to start yelling at me for make believe bs … so I opened my iPad and just hit record. The whole conversation is there - and I listened to it again just to make sure I wasn’t the one actually going crazy - she was definitely going on a tirade of “wrongs” I’ve committed against her - one was moving out when I was 15 because she was an alcoholic and abusive. 
          Another was me taking MY dog that I was solely responsible for. Also was talking about how I broke the sink when I was 10 (had honestly thought even she could get past that one by now).  

 She tried to say after I hung up that she needs me to be nicer. I told her that if I was able to get over my resentment towards her, it was possible for her to as well. And she even went as far to accuse me of yelling at her the whole time (whole recording - never even raised my voice). And said I’m going to “lose my whole family” if I can’t act right. I legitimately don’t think I could’ve handled anything better. 

I cannot say this with more seriousness - this post doesn’t even begin capture how hard I am getting mentally fucked by the woman who gave birth to me.

**So, WIBTA to sending the recording of the call to her, and then my family next time they try to tell me I’m in the wrong?** I don’t want to see her go down a rabbit hole again, but personally I really don’t feel like it’s fair that I have to lose my relationships with my whole family just because she’s delusional. 

P.s. I’m going no contact but I’d like to make sure that I am able to maintain my relationships with my entire extended family. I don’t have much family left, and I’m not willing to give them up without a fight.

I also pay my sister's husband $30 every month for gas money and his service because he drops me to and from work 4 days in a week. The reason I give $30 a month is because I live 5 minutes or less than 2 miles away from work lol. I occasionally buy a few groceries when we're out of certain things too or whenever my sister and I are craving for a certain dish. My sister and I both have jobs while my sister's husband is in school. We both work at our local grocery store and make an OK amount of money working there.

Recently, they've been struggling with money because they have so much stuff to pay for and my sister is the only one who is currently making money between the two of them. I feel for her and want to help her out, but I'm trying to save up for a car and medical/travel expenses for my surgery next year. My dad has been messaging telling me to give my sister more money to get groceries or put gas in the car, which I already do btw, so I wanted to come here and ask if I'm being an asshole for not wanting to give more than my share. I was also considering giving more for gas money to her husband, maybe $40 or $50 a month? I don't know, I just think $30 is more than enough for how far I work.

Also, I think that it shouldn't be my responsibility to help out with their bills. It should be her husbands responsibility to worry about helping her out. He's literally at school for only 5 hours a day, 6am-11pm. When he's home from school, he just hangs out at home in front of the TV with an Xbox controller in his hand. He also uses up most of their grocery budget because he is very picky with food and doesn't eat what my sister makes for us sometimes, so she would have to make a whole separate dish for him. He also has a ton of bills because he financed a lot of his things and has bills due to a collection agency or something. I don't know, I have no right to be in their business so I don't want to tell her these things but he could be making 60k with the degree he currently has. But because he doesn't like his degree/previous job, he decided to go to school for a job that pays 40k, which I have nothing against, you gotta do what you want, right? However, if you see your SO struggling with bills, wouldn't you want to help her out? I guess he doesn't really care, which is why I never really liked him. He kinda gives me the ick..

Anyways, AITA for only wanting to pay my share of the expenses?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"AITA for only paying my share of the expenses? I (20F) moved to a new state with my sister (27F) and her husband (30M). My sister and I decided to move in together to try and save a bit of money.

29,1ctrusi,WIBTA for asking my BFF to stop talking about ttc w/baby #2,"(28F) i have known my bff Beth (28F) for 13  years weve always been close and tell/share everything. Shes been there since I met my hubby 12 yrs ago and was my MOH at my wedding. We always talk about kids and she has a son with her Bf and we always talked about how fun it will be when I have my own

My hubby and I started trying for kids right away and I was pregnant within the first month, we were elated but I had an early loss. This started a host of issues for me and i didnt tell Beth right away but eventually told her after a few months of trying as whenever I would talk to her most of her questions would turn to when  are you going to have a friend for my kid?  I would normally joke back but I felt I had to tell her what happened and how my cycle changed drastically  and I felt like it was getting harder to figure out what to do next. I vented to her about changing my lifestyle and everything I was doing and she was supportive of me as her older sister had similar issues. lve gone to drs appts and have a plan to work on since my body never corrected Itself after the loss

So I was talking to Beth yesterday and she brought up my appt and in past conversations weve had she had made it seem like it was easy to get pregnant and she was planning when she wanted to have baby 2 and when she was going to stop her BC and how it was going to time perfectly with maternity leave and work vacay. I have always kept my mouth shut because I know shes excited & I want to support her, but when I would mention about how it might not happen the first try or what happens if she get pregnant later than what she's planning, she would brush it off and say well it's going to happen this way. Yesterday after I told her everything the dr told me and what labs dr wants and next steps, she started asking how I know when Im ovulating and how im timing things, getting nitty gritty about it and then she tells me that she just got off BC and they're trying for baby #2. I was fine with talking about everything, but what irked me about the whole conversation was when she started to rant and complain about how it shouldnt be taking this long and she thought it would have happened by now and its so stressful with how to time things and not be so stressed over missing fertile windows. Se just came off BC less than a month ago and this is her first normal cycle. I bit my tongue and let her rant but at one point she made a comment saying I really thought it would have happened by now, and I accidentally let slip a comment saying you're telling me, I've been waiting 8 months, to which she said oh yeah huh? And then went on to keep complaining about not getting pregnant right away. I want to tell her to stop talking/complaining about trying for another kid when she's never been in the same boat as me so WIBTA if I did? I might be the AH because it kills her baby buzz but idk what to do",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-17,"WIBTA for asking my BFF to stop talking about ttc w/baby #2 (28F) i have known my bff Beth (28F) for 13  years weve always been close and tell/share everything.
