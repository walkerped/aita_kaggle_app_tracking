0,1cugjwa,AITA for saying I'm not wearing a black dress to my Grandma's funeral?,"I, 21M, am a well passing trans man. I'm tall, relatively muscular, short hair and just overall guy-looking. My Grandma passed away recently, and had Alzheimers for quite some time before she died. She often used to not recognise me or ask my mum where \[my deadname\] was when I was right there. She would sometimes say she'd love to see me again and it was overall painful for the whole family. Before I came out gran used to love picking out dresses for me, and afterwards she moved onto suits.

But when she started forgetting stuff she kept talking about what kind of dresses I like now,  what she should get for me, etc. The funeral's next week and I mentioned that I would probably wear the last suit she got for me which was black and a vest just for extra blackness. My cousin looked at me like I'd just said the most ridiculous thing on the planet and she said, 'no, gran would have wanted to see you in a dress' and how I could disrespect her very wishes on such an occasion and what an asshole I am for putting my needs over hers when its her funeral.

I didn't quite know how to respond to that and luckily I was saved by her kids who started making a mess so she went after them. I frankly, think she's being fucking ridiculous. I couldn't pass as a girl if I tried anymore, much less fit into one of my old dresses. I think it would be utterly disrespectful if I showed up in a dress, it would look far too ridiculous/comical for a funeral. 

I'm 99.99999999999999% sure I'm not the asshole. I'm genuinely just no longer the build to be in a dress, I'm a grown man, it would be a joke. But just in case I'm missing something, AITA?

2,1cu3r5v,AITA for wanting to still go to my families vacation even if my partner can’t afford it,"Context here, I am a 21 female, and I have been with my 21 non-binary partner for almost 2 years. I genuinely love my partner and they make me feel loved, I’m not looking for advice into my relationship. As any normal lgbt couple, we are currently living together in a house. We have our own mortgage and everything. 

We were planning to take two trips this summer, one in July for the two of us in San Diego over their birthday to celebrate. I have paid for everything so far, that’s not to say I am upset about paying for everything, but that I think it’s an important fact to bring up. 

My mom planned a trip in August for us to go to Tennessee with my family, and as per usual that invite was extended to my partner as my family genuinely cares for my partner and our relationship. With that being said, she planned the trip to start on a monday and end on a friday, which is impossible for my partner to make with their current job. And I have totally thought about my partner just taking off, but their job only gives them vacation days and all of it is being used for our vacation in July, and for my partner to take off she would have to go unpaid, which for us is financially not a decision we can make. 

Edit: I understand it was unclear where the money came from for this trip, travel and stay is being covered by my mom, which includes my partner. It's just them taking unpaid time off that creates the financial dilemma. This was not without discussion, we did try to figure ways for them to save to go and etc.  

We briefly talked about it, and they agreed that we wouldn’t be able to make it. I got upset initially because they didn’t even suggest I go by myself, as my mom is my boss, and gave me 2 weeks of vacation time paid. I accept partial assholeness for not communicating my feelings right then and there. The next day, we get up to start getting ready for work, but I was still totally bummed out and they called me out. I tried to remain pretty light but I ended up being honest by saying I was hoping they would accept me going by myself. They sat down and started by saying I could go by myself but that would make them feel bad for not being able to afford being off, and having to stay home.

The conversation didn’t go much farther than what was said, as uncomfortable silence filled the room. We both started shedding tears, but they had to go to work. We plan to connect after we get off to talk more. I completely understand their feelings but I just recently started making efforts to not let my empathy for others allow me to be a doormat.

3,1ctvmeh,AITA for believing my boyfriend is way too close with his mom?,"I (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have only been dating for around 2 months now, but I've known him since the 7th grade. My concern is that he is way too close with his mom. I need to give context by explaining that his relationship with his mom is different from that of other males, and that's okay, because he lost his dad when he was very young. So it naturally makes sense that he would have an even closer and special bond with his mom and I respect that. I never had a problem with her at first (she used to take me out to family lunch and stuff), but ever since he and I started growing closer I have been noticing behaviors I'm not sure I'm okay with?

She is constantly asking him where he is, at all times, and needing him to check in with her during dates. I understand we're teenagers and it's his mom's car he's driving, but the constant need of location (even though she has Life360 which allows her to check) is getting on my nerves. He always has to ask for permission to go anywhere, and oftentimes when he asks he is afraid of the response he'll get because he might be asking ""too much"" in which she might go off on him. He is usually on eggshells when around her, and she almost always forbids him from doing typical, normal stuff if she deems it ""unsafe"". She eased a lot of my worries a while ago and explained how she will not be a ""monster-in-law"", and that as time goes on and we progress as adults she will slowly loosen the reins on the relationship. I get it, but things still haven't sat well with me since.

She hates it when we call for long periods of time, even if she got attention during the day, and will ""explode"" on him for not giving her enough time. My boyfriend swears he is not her only source of attention (after all he has brother/grandparents living under one roof), yet he also told me she doesn't really have any friends. We only go on dates once per weekend (if that), and he is home a lot with her. So I don't understand why she needs so much time. His excuse is she has no husband. Another thing is she seems to give him ""free will"" by allowing him choices to make, but then guilts him when he picks the one she doesn't want. They are also very touchy which each other (not in a creepy way I just find it off-putting considering all these factors together) which my boyfriend has argued is simply his way of connecting with people because he's a touchy person. My boyfriend swears that he has healthy boundaries and a healthy relationship with his mom, and she swears the same. He often compares it to my relationship with my sister, who is my best friend and who I'm close with. I personally think that's different because not only are we the same gender, she also isn't a parent and she respects my boundaries 100%.

**I want to know, am I overreacting?** Multiple of his friends agree that his mom is overbearing, but he does not think so-- or at least he won't address the problem with her.

4,1ctvlf2,WIBTAH If I Refuse to do What my Mom is Asking me rn,"Alright, so since this is my first time posting here, I might have some issues with objectivity in my post, but I'll endeavor to do my best. I apologize if this post is not relevant to this subreddit.

Here's the rundown:

My mom wants me (16M) to to take a specific job. Basically, we have a modest sized religious community growing at a nice pace in our area, and my mom wants me to volunteer as a teacher's assistant for their summer camp, which would have me go mondays through thursdays for basically the entire summer from around 9 something AM to 1 something PM.

All of their paid slots have been filled, meaning they most likely have met the requirements for what they need for the camp to function. I know the kids in this community, and the younger kids are, invariably, *menaces.* I have lived here for well over a year, and *every single kid* is a troublemaker. Being only 16, I already know that I would be run ragged trying to supervise and direct these kids. Now, if it was just for a few weeks, then I might have agreed. But not the whole summer.

In an effort to sweeten the deal, my mom offered to pay me herself. I was hesitantly willing to work if it brought money to the house, but the paid positions have filled already. And not only would I just be taking money from the house, I *wouldn't spend it.* All of my friends are casual friends- I gladly call them my friends, but despite the various circumstances we are in, I have never, and probably will never take them out to eat or treat them. I just turned 16, so I don't have a license yet, and I don't even have a phone to use apps to pay for things. So I would be limited to carrying cash around and going to places within biking distance.

My dad works full time, but he cooks for us pretty regularly and his food is great, so I wouldn't be spending money on food. My mom hates the idea of spending on videogames. Aside from those two things, I don't have much else to spend on.

So I wouldn't be spending the money that she's giving me while doing something I don't want to do.

Not only that, but I was looking forward to resting this summer. Throughout the school year, I have been taking college classes despite being in 10th grade, attending those classes on campus and getting good grades. I was looking forward to having no High School and just 1 or 2 college classes over the summer, using the rest of my time to just relax and do what I wanted. I am ahead on my education and generally a very obedient kid, but I just hate the idea of doing what she's suggesting.

However, on her side of the argument she's trying to teach me that I will have to do things in life that I don't want to, she wants me to have experience doing a job of any sort, and she already promised my help to her friends.

I have already told her repeatedly that I don't want to do it and avoided signing up with excuses so far, but that won't last forever.

So, would I be the asshole if I dug my heels in and just point blank refused, or would I be justified?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"WIBTAH If I Refuse to do What my Mom is Asking me rn Alright, so since this is my first time posting here, I might have some issues with objectivity in my post, but I'll endeavor to do my best.

6,1ctv8c5,AITA for going to a party without a friend that had been excited to go on prom night?,"On prom night, three of my friends (let’s call them Ally, Emma, and Katy) and I made a plan to meet up at a nearby 7/11 in order to drive to an after-party together. Ally, Katy, and I drove to the 7/11 in one car, while Emma went with her boyfriend in another.

It's approximately 12:30 a.m. when the three of us arrive at 7/11, and Emma is nowhere to be found. We wait a few minutes before checking her location, where we see she’s in an empty parking lot (with her bf). There have been situations previously where we’ve made plans to hang out with her, and she hangs out with her boyfriend instead (with no communication), so we were irritated. She hadn’t texted us or told us she was making any pit stops, so we assumed she wasn’t going to show up at all. We wouldn’t have left when we did, but parties can be time-sensitive, and the one we were going to was 30 minutes away. So, we called and texted her (and got no response), sending her the location of the party and telling her we were going to head there without her.

Twenty minutes into our drive, she calls, mad, asking us why we would leave her. We tell her we texted her earlier to inform her of our departure and explain we could have missed the party if we didn’t leave when we did. We then told her she could ask her boyfriend to drive her or drive herself, but she claimed he had a curfew and had to go home/didn’t want to go by herself before hanging up the phone. At this point, we feel bad but are almost at the party, so we decide to go anyway.

We aren’t at the party for more than 30 minutes before heading back and deciding to find Emma. We check her location and see she’s at the park we usually go to late at night every weekend. We pull up to the park nearing 2 a.m. and see her doing something inappropriate with her boyfriend in his car, which was especially surprising considering she said he had to go home over an hour ago.

We feel bad, not meaning to embarrass her/invade her privacy and drive away. A few minutes later we get a text from her saying she’s going home.  (We were supposed to sleepover that night.) Ally said we should follow her home to talk to her, so we did.

When we get to her house and get out of the car, she comes outside her house and starts screaming in all of our faces over the fact that we left her “knowing how much she wanted to be there,” even though she was the one who didn’t stick to the OG plan. We still apologized and tried to calm her down. 

I thought that would be the end of the argument, but it has since escalated and I haven’t spoken to Emma OR Ally in days, due to a plethora of reasons that have arisen because of this situation.

I know we should have waited at the 7/11 longer, but Emma still refuses to take any of the blame for the decisions made that night.

We aren’t at the party for more than 30 minutes before heading back and deciding to find Emma. We check her location and see she’s at the park we usually go to late at night every weekend. We pull up to the park nearing 2 a.m. and see her doing something inappropriate with her boyfriend in his car, which was especially surprising considering she said he had to go home over an hour ago.

We feel bad, not meaning to embarrass her/invade her privacy and drive away. A few minutes later we get a text from her saying she’s going home.  (We were supposed to sleepover that night.) Ally said we should follow her home to talk to her, so we did.

When we get to her house and get out of the car, she comes outside her house and starts screaming in all of our faces over the fact that we left her “knowing how much she wanted to be there,” even though she was the one who didn’t stick to the OG plan. We still apologized and tried to calm her down. 

I thought that would be the end of the argument, but it has since escalated and I haven’t spoken to Emma OR Ally in days, due to a plethora of reasons that have arisen because of this situation.

I know we should have waited at the 7/11 longer, but Emma still refuses to take any of the blame for the decisions made that night. AITA?",0.0,0.068139076,0,1

8,1ctv039,AITA for asking my wife if I can send her most of my paycheck to save it for us,"I (35M) struggle saving money. I lack impulse control when I spend, and I generally have poor financial habits. I have a growth mindset around this and I’m constantly trying to fix my deficits and financial situation/status. There has been improvement (my wife thinks so too) but it’s been a slow process.

My wife (33F) and I have been married two and a half years and together for 5. Being married, my finances affect her as well.

About a year ago, I asked my wife what she thinks about me direct depositing most of my paycheck to her so we can save for our future (I would only keep a predetermined amount for groceries and other daily life expenses). The reason for this suggestion was because even with my improvements I felt I ultimately lacked control and didn’t fully trust myself to save on my own.

My wife wasn’t comfortable with the idea at the time because she felt like it wasn’t her responsibility and that I should work on my financial habits in a way that leads to more permanent changes. It’s been about a year now, and she’s more amenable to the idea now because I haven’t been reaching my savings goals.

I respect my wife’s position and feelings about the situation. My frustration is that while I agree it isn’t her responsibility, I felt like I was asking for help to improve our marriage finances while being transparent about where I think I stand. To me, my suggestion wasn’t an ideal solution but rather a temporary solution while I continue to work on myself. I respect her position but I thought she took a bit of a hardline and I was hoping for more of a partnership/some help since we’re in this together. Again, not her responsibility, just a nice to have I suppose.

9,1ctuzi5,"AITA for Not Letting Conversation Stagnate and ""Talking Over"" My Friend?","All names present are false...

I (M25) am part of a group of friends who have kept in touch since High School. We've kept some level of contact through College and the start of our careers, and we meet up at least every few weeks (more often, every few days).

The issue is my friend Tate (F27). We all have our own social circles, obviously, but at least focus on the friend group when we get together. Tate doesn't. She ignores the people right in front of her in favor of whoever she's texting, and stalls the conversation and lets it stagnate so she can text her other friends while also having our attention.

What I mean by this is, she'll be looking at her phone and bring something up that's going on with her, and then stop mid-sentence. She won't talk for a good minute or 2, having a back-and-forth on her phone, and then start all over again and get maybe another few words into what she's talking about before doing it all over again. A 30 second anecdote about going to see the new Avatar movie and liking the new AMP suits will turn into 5 or 10 minutes of her stopping and starting.

No one will interrupt her, or talk about something else of substance, because that'd be rude. But I think she's being incredibly disrespectful in the first place for not just... getting it over with.

So... I stopped giving a shit about being rude. 

Whenever she stops like that recently, I've been moving on to talk about something completely different. I've done this the last three times we've all gotten together, and most of the others in the group have started doing the same. We only get to see each other a couple hours a week, after all, and we shouldn't have to give a substantial amount of those few hours to silence so someone can send tiktoks to someone not there or argue with someone over who should bring what to their work's cookout.

Well, it's apparently pissed Tate off, because my friend Kate (26F) showed up to our last dinner (we went to this new SEA restaurant in the area, it's really good) without Tate - who she gives a ride - and told us Tate feels like she's being excluded and doesn't want to hang out while it's happening, because we've been ""talking over"" her a lot. 

Kate, for reference, was one of the first people to also start keeping shit rolling. Our friends Robert (26M) and Josh (25M), however, think we're being assholes and should just stop so things can get back to how they've been for years because ""that's how she's always been"". Robert thinks that, if it's upsetting her enough that she isn't showing up, it must be something more than being ""talked over"", and we should be more patient with her.

I hate waste. Less is more. I’m not picky about prices, but I won’t buy more than I need. Even as a kid.

My BF, on the other hand, holds onto sentimental items, including things from his exes. His mom told me how he would show off the simpliest gift to friends and family. When he moved in, he decided to bring just his clothes and left his exes' gifts at his mom’s.

When we started, the first thing I bought him was a new pair of gym shoes because his were really old. He used them for a few weeks before buying a new pair, leaving mine forgotten. He also asked for me to gift him a jacket of mine. He used it a few weeks before leaving it forgotten in my car, my brother found it and asked for it. My BF didn’t notice it was gone until 4 months later. He also asked me to buy him certain adult toys, which we used for a few days before they were forgotten. I got mad about the pattern and threw them away. He got upset about it and promised he would use the replacement more, but 6mths later, it’s still unpacked.

My BF is a huge Taylor Swift fan. When she announced her new album, he was over the moon. He’s never had any original Taylor Swift merchandise because of his $$, so I decided to surprise him. I bought the most expensive vinyl in the store and some other items as a gift. He found out about it by mistake and was thrilled. I was happy to see him so excited.

The items arrived in April. Days passed, and he left the things on the bed in my son’s room, unpackaged. When my son came over, I had to move them elsewhere.

I asked him what he planned to do with the stuff, and he said he was thinking about it. The items started to gather dust, so I bought new furniture for the living room for him to display his collection. But nothing happened. The furniture arrived two weeks ago and is collecting dust. I tried to arrange them on the furniture, but he got mad, saying he wanted to decide how and where to put them. I’m tired of seeing them just lying around. I told him that if he doesn’t decide soon, I’ll either sell them or throw them away. To me, they’re just becoming garbage, and I can’t stand it.

He told me that IWBTA if I did that, but to me, it already feels like a waste of money.

So WIBTA?

EDIT: I have Mild OCD, that's why I need everything in order. He moved in 3 months ago and he was the one who decided to go to his mother when my son comes (neither I or my exwife have any issue with him bondign with my son). In his house there are left just books and his exes letters and stuffed animals, he decided left those there. We have bought things as a couple for ours to use in our home. He can change things at the apartment just fine, he is the one who changed our bedroom setting, also the living room, and he decided on colors for the bathroom, I don't make a fuss about it, we have had no issue with any of that.",Asshole,2024-05-17,"WIBTA if I throw away or sell my boyfriend's gift?

11,1ctukdk,AITA for telling my mother she couldn't attend my graduation with a stranger?,"I realize the title could push a very one-sided version of the story, so here's some context:

I (18F) am graduating next week. I've been really excited about this for a long time (as my 8th grade graduation was effectively canceled by Covid, and have therefore had a very clear idea in my head of what the events leading up to it, as well as the actual day, would be like. I have also known that the guest room in our house was going to be occupied by one of my mother's colleagues/distant relatives -- let's call him Jack. I don't remember ever meeting Jack, and I definitely don't feel like I know him in the slightest, though my mother says he has stayed in our house before, around 7-8 years ago.

Two days ago, I was celebrating an award with my family when the topic of Jack was brought up, this time with the added idea that they wanted to bring John to my senior dinner. I said I felt no reason for him to be there, as his plane would land just before the dinner, I didn't know who he was, and we had already RSVP'd spots for all three of my family members. My father agreed, and my mother didn't bring it up again.

Until today. This morning, my mother told me she wanted Jack to go to my senior dinner, forgetting I’d mentioned I didn't want him there. My mother asked why, finding that since the ""host allowed, I should too."" I said that since she has a habit of completely ignoring/brushing me aside when she brings colleagues to these events, and again, I don’t know him, I still didn't want him attending. I continued, rhetorically asking if he was going to bring me to my graduation, too. She said yes. I told my father that she wanted to bring this guy to graduation, and he agreed that she would likely make the event about him, and that it was weird she brought it up again.

When she got home, I mentioned it again, in a fairly angry tone (as we had already discussed his non-attendance two days prior), and said that since I didn't know this guy, I didn't want him there. She claimed that since he was going to NC only to visit us (and that the talk he was giving at the nearby university and the subsequent dinner with the dean were purely coincidental), he should be able to come. I reiterated that since I didn’t know the guy, he could not attend. I also gave an ultimatum -- either she could come without him, or she can't come at all. She said she would rather not attend. I was shocked and angry, and asked (in a moment of teenage dramatics) if ""she really cared about him more than me."" She said yes. I lashed out at her, yelling that I couldn't believe they would really rather him be there than come to my graduation without someone I've never met.

AITA for not wanting him there? Was I being too dramatic with the ultimatum, even though I also know that my ultimatum ultimately meant nothing, as I now know that my mother will attend with Jack whether I agreed he should be there or not.

UPDATE: sorry guys, i caved. i said my mother and jack could come, under three stipulations — “1. you must make a conscious effort to not just talk to him in chinese the whole time and actually pay attention to what i’m doing. if you just want to talk to him, go get coffee or something. waiting for me to get a something ive waited eight years for is not. the. time.

2. you don’t make any ’god it was my work/genes that got her here‘ or any other jokes where you take credit for my accomplishments — they are almost painfully unfunny.

3. we take more pictures without him then with him. i couldn’t care less if he’s your twin brother, he does not live with me, and therefore the pictures i have in twenty years from my one and only high school graduation will not have him in them. because you know him, you can navigate the conversation of kicking him out of the pictures.”

  
To be honest, I’d rather have an (albeit distant) family member at my graduation than having this damage my mother and I’d relationship to such an extreme degree — we’re both equally stubborn (unstoppable force vs. immovable object) and this is a level of event where I’d rather just cave. To be clear, i’m still very angry at her, but I’ll let Jack come in part so he can see this for whatever reason (I still don’t actually even know if he wanted to come in the first place, or if my mother just said hey wanna do this), and so my mother can still come to one of my first major life events.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"AITA for telling my mother she couldn't attend my graduation with a stranger?

I love my parents dearly but I don't want them to be involved.  I know myself that when I am stressed and my parents are around, their presence exacerbates my mood and I struggle not to be irritable and snappish, which I then feel guilty about.

In this case, it'll be me and my choices that are causing them upset and stressed,  and I don't think I'd have the emotional  capacity around the surgery to be in any state to deal with managing that. For all that it is major surgery, for me this is a really important step in being happier, and I couldn't be more delighted it's happening.

I know myself that when I am stressed and my parents are around, their presence exacerbates my mood and I struggle not to be irritable and snappish, which I then feel guilty about. I also am aware that when they are stressed or upset, I try overly hard to take the role of de escalator, focusing on calming things down or making them feel less upset. In this case, it'll be me and my choices that are causing them upset and stressed,  and I don't think I'd have the emotional  capacity around the surgery to be in any state to deal with managing that. For all that it is major surgery, for me this is a really important step in being happier, and I couldn't be more delighted it's happening. 

I've no idea how to but I'm going to have to tell them eventually and they're probably going to be hurt. In their mind, they'll be offering support to their child at a difficult time, only to be snubbed and left on the sidelines.

13,1ctu45e,AITA for telling my HS senior to go get a job and contribute?,"I'm a single mom of 3 who works full-time. My oldest's other ""parent"" went MIA and I haven't gotten financial help for her in 3 years now. 

She's starting college in the Fall. She's gotten a small merit scholarship so far, but with the FAFSA disaster, we're still not sure what other support, if any, is going to come through. I'm planning to help her with tuition so she can graduate from college debt-free, or almost. 
She wanted to live on campus... but we live only 15-20 minutes away and it doesn't make sense to pay for housing. Sure, she's likely going to need a car to get there (public transportation is not the best despite the proximity), but said car can also be used to get herself to a job.
The end of senior HS year has a million activities and trips, all pricey. I find it soooo excessive. I told her to choose wisely because I'd only pay for a few select ones, and yet she's constantly been trying to get more and more. She also wants to go out and eat out every weekend, and away on vacation. 🙄 I already bought her the concert tickets she wanted as a graduation present.

I told her a few months ago she should start looking for a job on the weekend/after school for now and when she starts college --other than her current non-paying 4-hour internship on Saturdays. Not only for pocket money, but also to help with college and the cost of a 2nd car. She has a job for 5 weeks this summer (the same as the past 3 years), but it's only 3 hours a day. I anticipate she'll make roughly $1,400 and has plans to blow it all off quickly.

I just can't seem to get it through to her that money doesn't fall from the sky. It's frustrating because I'm frugal, live a minimalist lifestyle, and am really good at budgeting and managing money. Although I certainly remember not having such a good sense of the cost of living as a teenager/young adult, I feel she's next level. I've been trying to teach her for many years, without success. (Her other parent was the complete opposite, and I kinda feel like we live in a community that has lots of entitled, loaded brats.)

So, WIBTA if I gave her a sort of ultimatum to get her priorities straight and start experiencing what it means to have responsibilities? Should I require her to save part of her summer income to pay for her college expenses? 
Do I let her have her last summer of semi-freedom and carefree attitude, and implement something more drastic in the Fall?

I told Ines this and she seems to understand that we just can’t afford it.

I got called in to talk to her English teacher over a paper she wrote last month. The prompt was “what I did on spring break.”

Ines spent it at home or tagging along with me to my job. But instead she wrote this ten page story about how she found this door in the office I clean that took her to the past.

She wrote a short fiction story instead of the paper her teacher wanted. She got a D.

Ines wanted me to convince the teacher to change her grade. 

I told her that she can’t submit short stories instead of homework, so she deserves that poor grade.  But Ines said that she doesn’t have anything to work with otherwise she hates English. 

We are going back and forth. She has a C in English and I told her she is grounded until she gets her grades up. 

Ines is upset and won’t speak to me. I had another meeting with a school counselor who suggests that I’m being too harsh on her, and to encourage her to write more. That’s not the problem. 

My problem is that Ines doesn’t listen to me or her teachers and acts like she’s living in that dimension in her stories. That’s not how the real world works.

Unfortunately, we are divorcing because my husband thinks I’m a terrible mom. My husband has been married twice but never had kids. 

I have two children who have been through a lot. Their late father was an alcoholic with ptsd and I stuck by his side until he died which was hard on our kids. Overall, they are good kids. They don’t get in trouble. They don’t cause trouble but neither has taken a traditional route. 

Despite my efforts, my oldest chose not to go to college, meandered around for a year after high school but is now in the military doing great. My youngest (17) isn’t in school and isn’t working. I pulled him out of school a year and a half ago and homeschooled for a year and now he’s working on getting his GED. He had a job for a little over a year when he was 15 but hasn’t worked since.Since leaving school he’s dedicated himself to learning video game design and programming. He’s getting very good at it (mostly self taught). His dream is to design and code his own game. He spends at least 8-10 hours a day doing the work or learning more about it through online resources. 

An important note is that we don’t all live in the same house. Given the challenges my children had with their father I committed to get him to 18 in our family home and he wouldn’t have to live with another father figure. Also important to note is that my husband and I got married and bought our marital home sooner than I wanted to because my husband was losing his job and was very anxious about where he was going to live, health insurance, etc.  I financed both homes and my husband doesn’t work or want for anything. 

This brings me to now. My husband is outraged that I allow my son to not work and not go to school. So outraged that he’s divorcing me unless I immediately change my gentle parenting style to be more authoritative. I’m not saying I disagree that it would be good for my son to work but I also think he just turned 17 and he’s working really hard on pursuing his dream. I just don’t see the harm in supporting that for a month or 2 more to see how far he can get.

We didn't and while I didn't get stung, my little sister (I have 3 in total) hot stung 3 times.

Okay so me (19 M) and my dad (56 M), alongside my little sisters and stepmom were driving and we were talking about a bees nest near our house. It reminded me of a story a long time ago where we went to a outside Ice Cream Parlor in the summer. My dad was insistent that we eat outside. Problem was I am a MASSIVE Mellisophobe and the parlor was swarming with bees. I begged him to let us eat in the car or take the food home. We didn't and while I didn't get stung, my little sister (I have 3 in total) hot stung 3 times.

23,1ctsnaf,WIBTA for kicking my best friend out because i’m lonely?,"AITA for not wanting to live with my best friend anymore because he’s making me feel left out and lonely?

I, 20 m, live with my best friend of the past five or six years, Leo 19 m, and recently I feel like I don’t exist to him or any of our friends anymore.

We had always been very close online and offline friends and went to school together for four years, dated for one year and then went no/low contact for several months until we made up. We’ve both lost several mutual friends but recently i’ve completely lost contact with almost all of my friends except for him and I feel like that’s just because we live together.

Before we moved in together last september, Leo lived with his partner in brighton and I would visit sometimes multiple times a week and stay over regularly, while working part time. he worked full time and always gave that as a reason why it was too much for him to come and visit me. I didn’t go over just to hang out, sometimes i’d help him with cleaning or important paperwork and we had a really close emotional bond. He was having relationship issues nearing the end of his lease and although he did stay with his partner, they did not end up moving in together as planned. 

Instead I moved out of my parents home with only a months notice so I could rent a flat, allowing him to be able to afford living in london. He pays half the utilities and a quarter of the rent, and he works full time (i think around 40 hours) and I work 50-55 hours a week. because of this and the fact that I regularly work the whole weekend we don’t often have much free time that aligns. 

We used to spend a lot more of our downtime talking or going out together but I can count on one hand the amount of times we have had a meaningful conversation in the last five months. Leo used to come into my room and we would chat for hours about absolutely nothing and everything, but now he just video calls all the people I used to be friends with and plays video games with them for hours (I am not much of a gamer). I feel pushed aside during these conversations and he often makes it clear that I am not welcome to join them, either by straight up ignoring me or telling me to leave his room. I know im not the best at messaging people to catch up but I dont think most of the people i would’ve called friends have messaged me first in the last five months, either to hang out or just to chat.

there’s a lot more to say about the situation but given the basics, do you think it would be reasonable for me to bring this up to him or am I being selfish feeling this way, especially because I dont want to live with him next year if it’s going to be like this?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"WIBTA for kicking my best friend out because i’m lonely?

Another example of her bullying is that one time when she was in town, we went to dinner with her and our friends.

So today during sixth period I was drawing this mouse and he kept erasing it and laughing about it. I told him to stop erasing my mouse and he responded with “That is not a mouse, it looks like an Aardvark” and “That isn’t even a good drawing; I could do better” (He is an artist and enjoys drawing). 

Every time he erased my drawing I kept telling him to stop and became visibly annoyed. Again he just laughed and me and found it amusing. I drew it again and I told him if he erases it, I’m going to throw his hat over the fence to the bleachers. He just laughed and said “You won’t you won’t” and “You wouldn’t do something like that.” He always wears hats and this hat in particular does not hold any personal significance to him. 

I told him that I WILL throw it and to just stop erasing my drawings. He said that if I throw it I’ll be buying him a new one and I told him I would not be paying for one. Either way after him erasing my drawings MULTIPLE times and laughing at me and me TELLING him that I’ll throw his hat if he doesn’t stop and I’m being serious. 

It comes to the last mouse drawing I made, I told him I’m being serious and to stop. So before we left he erased it and I told him that I’m going to throw it. When we walk I try to grab his hat and he moves so I say that he’s scared and knows I’ll do it. 

So he goes fine and lets me grab it and we are standing in front of the fence and we are staring at each other. He says “I trust you, I know you won’t do it” and I looked at him and said “I told you I would throw it” and then threw it over the fence. He looked at me and was shocked and kinda grabbed me and said “No now we’re going back to get my hat” and I pulled away and said “I can’t, I have my fire fighting class today and can’t be late” and he stared and me and said “That’s f**ked up” and “Why would you even do that” and I told him I would and I warned him multiple times. 

And we stared walking away and I yelled that I’ll come early tomorrow morning and get his hat, but we were already walking away and upset with each other.

First I wanna start by saying that my moms love language is definitely gift giving and mine is absolutely not. My dad who left us used to give me useless/expensive gifts and expensive/thoughless gifts sicken me. But that’s almost besides the point…

Here’s the real story:

My mom keeps buying me stuff. I think she has ADHD and we live countries away so l kinda understand compulsive buying/wanting to express care. But, mind you, I am very much a minimalist. She gets me PJs (I have a bunch), so now I need to throw some out to fit the ones she got me, she gets me stuff I do not need. I am not pleased just annoyed. 

Anyway, so I talked to her about it now that I came to visit her for the summer. I told her I Iiterally dont have space for new clothes and stuff. 

Weeks after I talked to her (and she got mad by the way and said she won’t get me anything), I asked her to sew my running shoes (they are fine just a little ripped and I wanna wait until I get to the US to get new ones. I never get to get something I like —bc someone always gives me stuff— so I was waiting until my tennis shoes were worn out bc I want to get myself something I like etc). Anyway, that was my mistake, so a week later I wake up and the first thing she says is “I got MYSELF new running shoes but if you wanna run with them… their a size 9…” 

And friends… I lost it. My moms a size 7. I said something like “then you will wear them, or you should return them, because I told you I didn’t want you to get me new shoes…” actually, I literally told her that beforehand. 

Anyway, I feel like an asshole. She got me really cute shoes, their pink bc it’s my favorite color, and now she’s wearing them. I’ve said I’d wear them (I didn’t really know she had already gotten them, I thought she like ordered them online or something). 


I feel like the worst asshole ever but idk what to do. This is such a first world problem, but I hate how annoyed I get with it and how I act.

27,1cts01s,WIBTA for sending a recorded phone call between my mom’s (50F) and I (21F) to my family? ,"** edit: recorded phone call between my mom and I 

My mom (50f) and I (22f) have never really gotten along. Love her because she’s my mom, but she’s genuinely one of the most difficult people I’ve ever met. 

Recently she has been especially difficult. I’ve been trying to maintain a good relationship with her now that she’s sober (not even because I want a relationship with her, but just want to support the sobriety for the sake of my other family members). 

She
 1) says things that aren’t true with shockingly seriously conviction 
2) yells at me constantly and then goes crying to the rest of my family that “im mean” and demands an apology. 
*i want to note here she puts me on BLAST to all of our friends and family* 

For example, she said I could stay with her during my surgery recovery. And then took it back a month before. And now is telling me I was crazy and that she never said I couldn’t stay with her. [[[[So now I’ve been desperately finding a way that my sister can come stay with me. It’s just a wreck because I actually need help to - you know-  not die for like 3 days.]]]]
           My grandma texted me and said I need to “treat my mother with a little more grace”. 

Anyways, today on the phone I could tell she was about to start yelling at me for make believe bs … so I opened my iPad and just hit record. The whole conversation is there - and I listened to it again just to make sure I wasn’t the one actually going crazy - she was definitely going on a tirade of “wrongs” I’ve committed against her - one was moving out when I was 15 because she was an alcoholic and abusive. 
          Another was me taking MY dog that I was solely responsible for. Also was talking about how I broke the sink when I was 10 (had honestly thought even she could get past that one by now).  

 She tried to say after I hung up that she needs me to be nicer. I told her that if I was able to get over my resentment towards her, it was possible for her to as well. And she even went as far to accuse me of yelling at her the whole time (whole recording - never even raised my voice). And said I’m going to “lose my whole family” if I can’t act right. I legitimately don’t think I could’ve handled anything better. 

I cannot say this with more seriousness - this post doesn’t even begin capture how hard I am getting mentally fucked by the woman who gave birth to me.

**So, WIBTA to sending the recording of the call to her, and then my family next time they try to tell me I’m in the wrong?** I don’t want to see her go down a rabbit hole again, but personally I really don’t feel like it’s fair that I have to lose my relationships with my whole family just because she’s delusional. 

P.s. I’m going no contact but I’d like to make sure that I am able to maintain my relationships with my entire extended family. I don’t have much family left, and I’m not willing to give them up without a fight.

I also pay my sister's husband $30 every month for gas money and his service because he drops me to and from work 4 days in a week. The reason I give $30 a month is because I live 5 minutes or less than 2 miles away from work lol. I occasionally buy a few groceries when we're out of certain things too or whenever my sister and I are craving for a certain dish. My sister and I both have jobs while my sister's husband is in school. We both work at our local grocery store and make an OK amount of money working there.

Recently, they've been struggling with money because they have so much stuff to pay for and my sister is the only one who is currently making money between the two of them. I feel for her and want to help her out, but I'm trying to save up for a car and medical/travel expenses for my surgery next year. My dad has been messaging telling me to give my sister more money to get groceries or put gas in the car, which I already do btw, so I wanted to come here and ask if I'm being an asshole for not wanting to give more than my share. I was also considering giving more for gas money to her husband, maybe $40 or $50 a month? I don't know, I just think $30 is more than enough for how far I work.

Also, I think that it shouldn't be my responsibility to help out with their bills. It should be her husbands responsibility to worry about helping her out. He's literally at school for only 5 hours a day, 6am-11pm. When he's home from school, he just hangs out at home in front of the TV with an Xbox controller in his hand. He also uses up most of their grocery budget because he is very picky with food and doesn't eat what my sister makes for us sometimes, so she would have to make a whole separate dish for him. He also has a ton of bills because he financed a lot of his things and has bills due to a collection agency or something. I don't know, I have no right to be in their business so I don't want to tell her these things but he could be making 60k with the degree he currently has. But because he doesn't like his degree/previous job, he decided to go to school for a job that pays 40k, which I have nothing against, you gotta do what you want, right? However, if you see your SO struggling with bills, wouldn't you want to help her out? I guess he doesn't really care, which is why I never really liked him. He kinda gives me the ick..

29,1ctrusi,WIBTA for asking my BFF to stop talking about ttc w/baby #2,"(28F) i have known my bff Beth (28F) for 13  years weve always been close and tell/share everything. Shes been there since I met my hubby 12 yrs ago and was my MOH at my wedding. We always talk about kids and she has a son with her Bf and we always talked about how fun it will be when I have my own

My hubby and I started trying for kids right away and I was pregnant within the first month, we were elated but I had an early loss. This started a host of issues for me and i didnt tell Beth right away but eventually told her after a few months of trying as whenever I would talk to her most of her questions would turn to when  are you going to have a friend for my kid?  I would normally joke back but I felt I had to tell her what happened and how my cycle changed drastically  and I felt like it was getting harder to figure out what to do next. I vented to her about changing my lifestyle and everything I was doing and she was supportive of me as her older sister had similar issues. lve gone to drs appts and have a plan to work on since my body never corrected Itself after the loss

So I was talking to Beth yesterday and she brought up my appt and in past conversations weve had she had made it seem like it was easy to get pregnant and she was planning when she wanted to have baby 2 and when she was going to stop her BC and how it was going to time perfectly with maternity leave and work vacay. I have always kept my mouth shut because I know shes excited & I want to support her, but when I would mention about how it might not happen the first try or what happens if she get pregnant later than what she's planning, she would brush it off and say well it's going to happen this way. Yesterday after I told her everything the dr told me and what labs dr wants and next steps, she started asking how I know when Im ovulating and how im timing things, getting nitty gritty about it and then she tells me that she just got off BC and they're trying for baby #2. I was fine with talking about everything, but what irked me about the whole conversation was when she started to rant and complain about how it shouldnt be taking this long and she thought it would have happened by now and its so stressful with how to time things and not be so stressed over missing fertile windows. Se just came off BC less than a month ago and this is her first normal cycle. I bit my tongue and let her rant but at one point she made a comment saying I really thought it would have happened by now, and I accidentally let slip a comment saying you're telling me, I've been waiting 8 months, to which she said oh yeah huh? And then went on to keep complaining about not getting pregnant right away.

30,1cujoln,AITA for not letting my neighbors use my backyard?,"Created an account to ask.

My partner and I (F30s) just got some new neighbors. They moved in about a month ago. We met them briefly. They are a couple around our age and a daughter who might be 4 or 5, and a dog. 

We have our backyard fully fenced in with a privacy fence. Their yard doesn't. I was out front last weekend when the couple came up our driveway and started chatting. They mentioned that they were on a waiting list to get their yard fenced in but were told it would be a few months. They said they would really like their daughter and dog to have a place to run around but didn't feel comfortable with the lack of fence (our neighborhood backs up to a wooded area and a creek). 

They asked if they could borrow our backyard for a few hours a day so they could let everyone run worry free. I admittedly immediately didn't like this, but I told them I would think about it.

I talked to my partner, and we both agreed this wasn't a good idea. We have two dogs ourselves, and they can be a tad protective of their yard. One of them also doesn't love kids and the other one can be a tad dog selective. Because of this, we would have to coordinate when we could let our dogs out and that's just not something we want to deal with. There are just too many things that could go wrong. Plus that good ole American worry that if someone got hurt we could get sued. 

The guy stopped by again on Wednesday and asked if we had given it any thought. I told him we had discussed it, and unfortunately it just wasn't going to work out with our dogs and their schedule so we wouldn't be able to accommodate them. He immediately got sour and said it was nice to know how neighborly we were. He left abruptly but I could hear him muttering under his breath.

Him and his wife have made a big show of snuffing us the last couple of days. My partner said they will get over it, and while I'm not going to reconsider, I do feel kind of guilty.

33,1cujbve,AITA for having my phone die for a few hours.,"I am in the process of switching apartments, all the normal motions like touring my current place. I am quite fortunate to have my parent co-sign for my apartment and assist me while I go to college. As such, their info is on the lease and with our realtor. I work a night shift which has my sleep schedule quite late and usually I wake up around 11-12 in the morning. This has been consistent over a year so when I’m unresponsive at 9am it’s always been because I was asleep.

My realtor called me to schedule a tour but apparently my voicemail was not working. (Strange as another realtor had left me a message 2 days previously). He then called my parent who - for better or worse - has my location on iPhone. They saw I was last at work “15 hours ago” and based of that assumed something horrible could have happened. My phone had been on until 9am according to my battery history. it was in that 3 hour window before I woke up and charged it that everything transpired. 

They proceeded to send emails every 45 minutes and I assume spam call me, though they even acknowledged in the texts I was probably asleep. 

My main concern wasn’t this, as I didn’t even see the emails until later. It was that in lieu of my absence, my parent had given the ok to give a tour the following day. They don’t live here, and even if their name is on the lease, I am the most impacted by any decision regarding the comings and goings. 

The subsequent phone call felt like I was being shamed and and disrespected with phrases like “he’s coming whether you like it or not, he has a master key”, this isn’t how “adults act” and “we were just worried something happened” (as though we haven’t gone through the same thing a dozen times before of me just being asleep). Being a person who works in IT and regularly fixes things for my parents, their derision over what ended up being a glitch on my carriers end felt so underhanded. Both my parents are extremely well versed in their fields and if I was to claim they did something incorrectly to do with that field it’d be a death wish. And then when I explained all of this, and how I felt, their response was to say “next time don’t escalate the situation”. BRUH….. 

I am self aware enough to know the whole thing is a little petty and part of a bigger issue with family dynamics but damn I’m frustrated. I just wanna be able to feel unstressed in my own place and deal with my own problems. 

Appreciate any thoughts you guys have <3

35,1cui0bl,AITA for refusing to send my friend the answers(please read),"so im a 15 yo freshman, and there is one girl in my class i used to be close with, but over the past 6 months I’ve drifted away from her. Nothing specifically happened, but i just started noticing she’s never started a conversation with me. The only reason we would talk is if I literally walked up to her and started a conversation. It made me feel like we werent really friends, i was just someone convenient until she saw her real friends, and then she ignores me. 
          Anyways, ive always been okay with lending my friends answers when they ask because we all have bad days and i know id really appreciate if someone did that for me. So this girl is really popular, and lately she justs texts people all class and hasnt been doing any classwork. I thought it was just a bad week, but this has been going on for a while. even after falling out with her, i always gave her answers bc i felt bad when i saw how anxious she got about recieving a bad grade. Now its the end of the year, and im being bombarded with finals and the work along with that. We recently were assigned this really long assignment; super tedious, and i maybe spent like 3-4 hours on it, which is a lot for this specific class. It was so boring, but i still managed to force myself to do it. We had a block period together to complete this assignment, and i kid u not, she spent the entire 1.5 hours on her phone as im right next to her doing the work. I think nothing of it, but 10 minutes before its due, she texts me asking me to send her the google doc. I dont respond, but this happens at lunch time. She texts 2 people at my table to tell me to send it to her. i explain how im sick of it, how she ONLY ever texts me asking for answers, and i dont feel comfortable sending it since she just sat on her ass when she could have completed it herself and im done letting peope like her walk all over me. 2 peope told me its not that big a deal, and 2 others said dont send it because i put the time in and she didnt. 

        This girl also hasnt been doing work for other classes. Like this huge project for finals, and she tells her groupmates to shut the fuck up after they tell her to get off her phone and help. Anyways, now shes pissed at me for not sending it and im pretty positive shes told a bunch of other people that im an asshole for not sending it since my bestfriend suddenly stopped speaking to me today, and she is friends with that girl.

       I asked another friend about this and she agreed i shouldnt send it, but then jokingly called me petty for it. Isnt that just called having self respect, not letting people who clearly dont value u, use u? Why am i petty for what i did?

       Thank gods it’s friday so i dont have to face everyone till monday, but today was awful. Felt completely cast out by everyone when everything was fine yesterday. I feel like everyone hates me and im wondering if i should have just sent her my answers.

          Anyways, ive always been okay with lending my friends answers when they ask because we all have bad days and i know id really appreciate if someone did that for me. So this girl is really popular, and lately she justs texts people all class and hasnt been doing any classwork. I thought it was just a bad week, but this has been going on for a while. even after falling out with her, i always gave her answers bc i felt bad when i saw how anxious she got about recieving a bad grade. Now its the end of the year, and im being bombarded with finals and the work along with that. We recently were assigned this really long assignment; super tedious, and i maybe spent like 3-4 hours on it, which is a lot for this specific class. It was so boring, but i still managed to force myself to do it. We had a block period together to complete this assignment, and i kid u not, she spent the entire 1.5 hours on her phone as im right next to her doing the work. I think nothing of it, but 10 minutes before its due, she texts me asking me to send her the google doc. I dont respond, but this happens at lunch time. She texts 2 people at my table to tell me to send it to her. i explain how im sick of it, how she ONLY ever texts me asking for answers, and i dont feel comfortable sending it since she just sat on her ass when she could have completed it herself and im done letting peope like her walk all over me. 2 peope told me its not that big a deal, and 2 others said dont send it because i put the time in and she didnt. 

        This girl also hasnt been doing work for other classes. Like this huge project for finals, and she tells her groupmates to shut the fuck up after they tell her to get off her phone and help. Anyways, now shes pissed at me for not sending it and im pretty positive shes told a bunch of other people that im an asshole for not sending it since my bestfriend suddenly stopped speaking to me today, and she is friends with that girl.

       I asked another friend about this and she agreed i shouldnt send it, but then jokingly called me petty for it. Isnt that just called having self respect, not letting people who clearly dont value u, use u? Why am i petty for what i did?

       Thank gods it’s friday so i dont have to face everyone till monday, but today was awful. Felt completely cast out by everyone when everything was fine yesterday. I feel like everyone hates me and im wondering if i should have just sent her my answers. AITA?",0.0,0.08632803708314896,0,1

Some people even say i sound sick or depressed or like i am crying or tired. I try to ask people what a normal voice sounds like and they never answer. I ask why someone would make a youtube video if they feel like crap and they don't answer. I already hated my voice before people started doing this so of course people saying this stuff makes it worse. It doesn't matter what i say or do people keep acting like i am the bad guy.

Even if someone is concerned i hate it, and people get mad when i tell them to not talk about my voice. ""They are just asking out of concern"" There is nothing to be concerned about, so why is anyone concerned? It's not like i am dying. But according to everyone it's bad to not want people to be concerned.

I get people being concerned isn't really bad but i am so sick of people thinking there is something wrong with me just because i ""don't sound normal"". I'm autistic not dying.

Even if i was tired there is nothing wrong with being tired, that is a normal human thing that happens to everyone. I don't get sick very often since adults usually have a built up immune system. If i am crying/sick/depressed/tired then making videos is the last thing i would want to do. It just makes no sense why people would think i would make videos if i was any of those things.

I just want people to respect the fact that i don't want anyone saying anything about how i sound. I tell people how these comments make me feel and they still tell me ""It's just someone being nice"" ""It's just a joke"" ""Go to therapy"" ""Get help"" ""Turn the comments off"" I have gone to therapy and it didn't help me at all. Turning the comments off only hurts the video. It's basically every comment i get and i am so annoyed that all people seem to talk about is how my voice sounds.

I (16F) have a very bad relationship with my parents due to a plethora of reasons I believe they are narcissists and that they do not care about me (particularly because they say it) and also because they have a long history of physically abusing me especially because when I was about 11 and became selectively mute and sewer slidable from the stress and it gives me headaches when I cry. Their work surrounds caring for the elderly but my mum has admitted to leaving clients without a bed for a night. All this said I truly think they are horrible people who I cannot last around much longer... But anyone would call me a spoilt child if I did because no-one knows this.

I went to sleep on the big day it was after school so I was tired and I took a nap.

I wake up and its 9:30 my mum starts yelling at me for wasting everyone's time and because they all put so much work into my party and I didn't want to come.They didnt even wake me up. They didnt even try. I know this because most every morning one of them comes and wakes me up for school without fail. But they all pretended I was the selfish one.

45,1cuh7ve,AITAH for telling my mother it was insensitive and disrespectful of her to buy new furniture she doesn’t need while I am taking care of her myself because we can’t afford to pay for her care after an injury? ,"5 weeks ago, my 78 year old mom fell and broke her ankle in 2 places requiring surgery (a steel plate w/9 screws and some ligament repair mesh was needed). She lives alone, about 45min away. In-home full time care is crazy expensive, and we can’t afford it, so I have been living at her house 24/7 to care for her because she understandably can't do anything for herself.

This has obviously upended my life, as l've been away from my wife and home for 5 weeks and have been unable to look for work. I haven’t worked since August of 2023, and she's on Social Security, so this arrangement was primarily to save money.

To help in her current predicament, she just purchased a new ""lift"" recliner (around $900) so she can get up and down more easily. That purchase makes perfect sense given her age and condition as it will help her in recovery. But now, she’s also replacing her living room furniture - 2 new rugs, a sofa, coffee table, etc.  Current furniture is functional and in good condition, she just doesn't like the look of it. From my perspective, the timing of this seems impractical at best, but given the circumstances it’s also insensitive, tone-deaf and a bit disrespectful. I told her this, and her response was basically “I don’t see the connection”. 

I have a good relationship with my mom, and would like to keep it that way. She has freely expressed her gratitude and is always telling everyone what a great son I am for taking care of her, but this
redecoration decision has me pretty angry and feeling unappreciated and devalued.

48,1cufzl0,AITA for making a comment about someone’s deceased father? ,"I know the title sounds horrible, but I can explain 

Today I was in a gc argument with someone who I’ll call Larry. For more context Larry is very homophobic and misogynistic. 

This is what partly started the argument so I started saying things like “someone’s stuck in the closet” just to spite him. He then goes “I’m straighter than the pole your mother dances on”. So I said “at least I have a mom. All you have is 2 dads” (for the record I am NOT homophobic, I just said that to get under his skin). 

He then proceeds to tell me that his father had passed away from a heart attack a while back. Now believe me, I wasn’t aware of this at all , and when I tried to apologize and tell him that I didn’t know, he goes “IT DOSENT MATTER IF YOU KNOW OR NOT YOU DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT PEOPLES PARENTS AT ALL”. I guess he forgot that I had only made that comment because he spoke about MY PARENTS first. He blocked me before I could explain myself further.

He then took the drama to his Snapchat story, leaving out the facts that 1) I wasn’t aware his dad had died and 2) I only made that comment after he had mentioned my mom. 

Now I have a BUNCH of people blowing up my phone calling me a piece of shit. 

Before I try to explain myself on my own story, was I truly wrong for making that comment, even with all this context?

49,1cufw3s,AITA for studying instead of babysitting?,"Obligatory lurker warning 
I (17f) have exams coming up in about ten days and this weekend my only plans are studying, studying and then some studying. These are end of school year exams, so I'll have seven subject exams, a French oral exam and a music practical test. 

My aunt (46f) and her husband are going to a concert a couple of hours away on Sunday and they need a babysitter for their three kids, 11m, 9f and 7f, from 12am-8pm. They live around forty minutes from me so realistically it's more like 11am-9pm in commitment terms. 

I've babysat for them before and my cousins are really good kids, they go to bed when you tell them, they tidy up after themselves, and they're not fussy or entitled at all so I know I could bring my books to their house to get at least some study done. 

I also have all of Saturday to study, but even if I bring my books on Sunday, I obviously will still be watching the kids and hanging out with them, making them food etcetera so I told my mom I wouldn't do it. She said I could take them from 12-6 instead and their uncle on their dad's side would pick them up then, but that's still the whole day gone. 

I feel bad about it, because I'm in an after school study program so I'll still be able to study during the week before the exams but I wanted to take the weekend to properly go over everything. I tend to study well when I can talk through the material out loud, but I know my aunt really does need this babysitting and she's always good to me, and pays me fairly when I look after them. I'm also worried it'll come back on my mom because my aunt asked her to ask me and I don't want to cause her any hassle.

51,1cufm4w,AITA for telling my wife's family they can't cook in our Airbnb,"My wife and I have 2 kids (6 and 3) and my wife has 2 siblings. One brother (living in Cali and soon to be married later this summer), one sister (married with 3 kids all under 10) and both her parents (still married).We are pretty close with my wife's family, spend a lot of time with them and all the kid cousins get along super well. I have a very good relationship with everyone.

The brother is getting married later this summer in Southern California. The rest of the family, including us, live in the Midwest. We've planned a big 7 night family vacation down to SoCal for the wedding.

I proposed that our family (4 of us) + my sister in laws family (2 adults, 3 kids) and my wife's parents (2 adults) rent a house for the 7 nights we will be in SoCal. My reasons were:

-More space for everybody instead of living out of a suitcase in a hotel for 7 nights  
-Have a kitchen available to cook and eat together instead of eating out for every single meal -My son has a severe anaphylactic allergy to nuts so eating out can often be stressful for us as a family.

Initially everyone was onboard. I estimated that renting a large enough house (via AirBnB) would be approx $300/night per family unit (So $900/night split 3 ways). There are cheaper ones but they would be too far from the wedding venue.

My sister-in-law and my parent-in-law learned that hotel rooms are available for approx $150/night. They've now bailed on the house idea and have reserved hotel rooms. It's their money and I understand renting a house is a lot of money to pay above the hotel rates. I have no issue with them changing their mind.

My wife and I still want to stay in a house, mainly for access to a full kitchen, so we booked an Airbnb. The smaller house will cost us about $350/night. So we'll be spending about $350 more than planned ($50 x 7 nights). We've booked the AirBnb and the free cancellation period has now expired. We can't cancel without losing money.

When my wife's family learned that we booked an AirBnb they said, ""Oh great! We can come to your house to cook food"". I said , ""No. If you wanted to cook then you should have reserved a house with us, not make us pay the extra for accommodations with a kitchen and then take advantage of that.

Anyways, I (24F) am currently a part of a team that raises pedigree-puppies to become service-dogs for people with mental health issues ie. anxiety, ptsd, autism etc. I would like to stress that I am not a professional trainer, or even employed, I'm rather a sort of an animal-loving volunteer, helping with the groundwork for what the dogs will hopefully become. I was responsible for a puppy for 6 months, teaching her the basics, such as eye-contact, ""touch"", sit, stay and other such commands for family friendly dogs. The issue, however, was that it really took a toll on me, as it really was 24/7. (I realise that a living creature will always need your love and attention, especially while training to become a service-dog, but I was coming up short on mental ressources, as she severely disturbed my sleep every night, sometimes once an hour, because she was sick when i first got her) It was intense.

Don't get me wrong, I loved that dog with everything I had, but never having had a puppy or baby by myself before, so I did struggle a LOT in the first 3 months of training and raising this puppy. So much so, I'm convinced that I could never have a dog-in-training, by myself again, for that amount of time, without suffering severe mental burnout.  As a result, I informed the team leader that I would not be taking another puppy in full-time, but would be happy to assist anyone else, taking over/babysitting for a weekend or if anyone needed a break for any reason, since i went through the training with one puppy already, I could easily step in. But since I'm also hoping to start uni this September, I would not be full-time. She initially accepted, empathising with my ""rough start"", however...

There is another volunteer dropping out of the project in July, and the puppy is in need of some who can take over. Even though I already politely declined, the team-leader is pushing for me to take over, saying the second time round is such a breeze, which would mean that I would be training it full-time until the start of november... I can't help feeling guilty though, as the Team-Leader has told me there is no-one else to take it in... If I do not accept, it is likely that the puppy will not become a service-dog, and just get sold off to someone else.

Anyways, I went up to the cities this week to DoorDash to earn some money because we’ve had a lot of setbacks this week. 

  Anyways, last week I was not able to work because my sister ended up going to the hospital with miscarriage issues. She was there for two days and I watched her children. So anyways, while I was up in the cities, the kids were staying with their dad who stays with his brother and his sister-in-law, however last night he text me and tells me that the kids are not looking very well. I went to go check on my kids and they were both running fevers,so I packed them up this morning to take them home and I texted my sister to let her know that my children weren’t feeling well. 

  I was gonna bring them home and put them to bed, she texted me back and says that’s a hard. No you can’t bring them here because she’s planning to go to visit her husband’s uncle who’s on hospice and is a nanny for a two month old baby from home. Now I got really upset with her. I told her you expect me to have my children sleep in a car because our place of residence is your home when they are not feeling well. I said it didn’t make sense to me and that I didn’t know anybody who would do that to someone. She held onto it saying that I was being selfish and that I was exactly what my mother said a user. I don’t see it as that I see her making my kids when his uncles already on hospice, and I also see her not maybe asking them if they can nanny at their house as an excuse to ask me to move out. 

  I told her I don’t understand at all. I was very upset I told her she would not do this to her kids etc. basically she made it seem like I am a selfish horrible person because I don’t feel that my kids should have to sit in a car because she nannies a two month old and because her husband’s uncle is on hospice and they’re planning to visit him. Their original plan she had told me earlier in the week was that they were going to leave Friday night and come back Monday morning, so I thought that it would be an empty house. Nobody would end up getting sick and my kids would be recuperated by Monday morning. 

  she changed that plan and then decided that they weren’t going to leave until 4 AM on Saturday, so I feel like it’s not my fault that they didn’t stick to the plan that they originally had told me and it’s not my fault that my kids got sick. she says that I’m bringing back illnesses from the cities, even though my children have gotten sick multiple times from kids that she has Nannied,  I feel sick is just something that spreads among children no matter what you do. I’d also like to add that I do contribute to the household. I bring things home when it’s needed. 
  My boyfriend pays her $100 every single week to pay off anything that we may owe them. I also try to not be there during the week while she’s nannying to make it easier for her by going and working in a nearby town DoorDash. I also share my EBT benefits with her. I have bought five to $600 worth of groceries every single month and I haven’t even eaten them all because we’ve been gone while she’s doing her nanny job or we’ve been up in the cities visiting their father. 

  We want to get our own place, but we have a lot of past mistakes that need to be rectified before we can do that, however if she didn’t want us there, she could’ve just told us that not made a big deal, especially when my kids are not feeling well.

I told her you expect me to have my children sleep in a car because our place of residence is your home when they are not feeling well. I said it didn’t make sense to me and that I didn’t know anybody who would do that to someone. She held onto it saying that I was being selfish and that I was exactly what my mother said a user. I don’t see it as that I see her making my kids when his uncles already on hospice, and I also see her not maybe asking them if they can nanny at their house as an excuse to ask me to move out. 

  I told her I don’t understand at all. I was very upset I told her she would not do this to her kids etc. basically she made it seem like I am a selfish horrible person because I don’t feel that my kids should have to sit in a car because she nannies a two month old and because her husband’s uncle is on hospice and they’re planning to visit him. Their original plan she had told me earlier in the week was that they were going to leave Friday night and come back Monday morning, so I thought that it would be an empty house. Nobody would end up getting sick and my kids would be recuperated by Monday morning. 

  she changed that plan and then decided that they weren’t going to leave until 4 AM on Saturday, so I feel like it’s not my fault that they didn’t stick to the plan that they originally had told me and it’s not my fault that my kids got sick. she says that I’m bringing back illnesses from the cities, even though my children have gotten sick multiple times from kids that she has Nannied,  I feel sick is just something that spreads among children no matter what you do. I’d also like to add that I do contribute to the household. I bring things home when it’s needed. 
  My boyfriend pays her $100 every single week to pay off anything that we may owe them. I also try to not be there during the week while she’s nannying to make it easier for her by going and working in a nearby town DoorDash. I also share my EBT benefits with her. I have bought five to $600 worth of groceries every single month and I haven’t even eaten them all because we’ve been gone while she’s doing her nanny job or we’ve been up in the cities visiting their father. 

  We want to get our own place, but we have a lot of past mistakes that need to be rectified before we can do that, however if she didn’t want us there, she could’ve just told us that not made a big deal, especially when my kids are not feeling well. I can’t imagine sitting in a car when you have a fever and feeling cruddy.. so am I the asshole or is she?",1.0,1.051963448524475,1,1

57,1cuewhe,AITA for refusing to let my good friend's husband come to my wedding?,"My friend has been married for almost 3 years. They got married after talking online for a few months, spent most of their first year of marriage long distance (he was stationed with the Army in Germany and she was in California), and all the time they've physically been together has been shaky. Like, constant fighting. He's also cheated on her multiple times with multiple people. She found out about his most recent affair, like, 3 weeks ago. This all said, she keeps taking him back and I don't think they have any plans to divorce. At least not that I've heard of.

I'm getting married next year. Our wedding will have about 110 people, including my friend. I told her that I would give her a plus one, but under NO circumstances is her husband allowed to come.

I think that I should be able to include and exclude anyone I want from my wedding. I hate this guy, not just because of how he's treated my friend (although that is mainly why), but because he's also talked shit about me repeatedly. He started doing that when I was still totally in their corner, early into the relationship. When he was overseas with the Army, I sent little care packages to him when I was sending things for my friend. I referred clients to his personal training business and made sure to say hi to him whenever I did video calls with my friend. 

Whether they're still married at that time next year or not, I don't want anyone who has talked poorly about me to be present on the most special day of my life. People who don't completely wish us well have no place there. At least, that's how I feel. And my fiancé supports that fully.

My friend said that I'm being an asshole for not including him because that's her husband, and they should be able to go to my wedding as a couple. She also said that it would be weird for her to bring her mom or sister as her date to my wedding. She said that as her close friend, I should want her to be happy and encourage her to have and share these experiences with her husband. I said that it's my wedding and I can invite whoever I want and if she really has that much of a problem with it, she can stay home, too. I would be sad if she wasn't there, but I also refuse to be emotionally manipulated into letting him come. Especially if he dislikes me so much, I don't understand why he would want to come in the first place.

Am I the asshole here? I understand her side and part of me questions whether I'm being too dramatic about it.

64,1cudrph,AITA for calling my Head of School out for breaking copyright law?,"I (NB14) spent this school year directing my school's musical. It's the first time we've ever done a musical, and while I'm indebted to the help of many people, this is my brainchild, and I've put in a ton of work to make this possible

Of course, nothing happens at school without the Head of School's (M55) involvement. The Head is a family friend of mine, and we've always been on great terms. He gave us permission to run this back in the fall and then gave us mostly free reign for all other show stuff. We applied for the performance license in September, and afterward, he sent me the copyright rules to review. The rules were pretty simple and included one big rule: no recording the performance and sharing it online. He, the faculty advisor (F28, and I all read the license agreement and stayed aware of this rule (or at least I thought so). It was even on the first page of our program, as required by the license. He should have known this existed

Flash forward to yesterday and we had our opening night which went super well (shout out to the cast, who worked super hard on this.) But this morning, I opened up Instagram and saw that the school had posted some videos of the show online

This seemed off, so I went to talk to the Head (who controls our socials). We had a short conversation, during which I basically said, ""This is illegal"" and he said, ""Everyone does it, stop bothering me""

That might be where I should have let it go. But I started looking back through the license, and it was very clear that what he posted broke all our agreements. The license specifically states several times, ""You may not post any recordings of the performance on social media."" I talked it through with the faculty advisor, and she agreed that another email made sense. Maybe he just didn't read it through clearly enough. I didn't want the company we licensed from to strike down our agreement because we have another show on Sunday, and that would be super unfair to the cast. I thought this was what I needed to do.

I sent him an email with excerpts from our licensing agreement, clearly showing that we can't post videos. I also included some next steps that the faculty advisor and I had created for what to do to undo the damage from his posts. Soon, the day was over, and I hadn't heard anything from him other than two forwarded emails reminding the community about Sunday’s show

I just spoke to the faculty advisor, who said that she'd talked with the Head. Apparently, he said that he thought we bought a Streaming Agreement (we did... a LIVEstreaming agreement) and that if he heard about this from me again, he would cancel the Sunday show 

AITA? What he did was literally a crime under copyright law, but maybe I shouldn't have pushed him that much. If he doesn't care, it doesn't reflect on me as the student director. And I really don't want to risk the show getting canceled.

It's the first time we've ever done a musical, and while I'm indebted to the help of many people, this is my brainchild, and I've put in a ton of work to make this possible

Of course, nothing happens at school without the Head of School's (M55) involvement. The Head is a family friend of mine, and we've always been on great terms. He gave us permission to run this back in the fall and then gave us mostly free reign for all other show stuff. We applied for the performance license in September, and afterward, he sent me the copyright rules to review. The rules were pretty simple and included one big rule: no recording the performance and sharing it online. He, the faculty advisor (F28, and I all read the license agreement and stayed aware of this rule (or at least I thought so). It was even on the first page of our program, as required by the license. He should have known this existed

Flash forward to yesterday and we had our opening night which went super well (shout out to the cast, who worked super hard on this.) But this morning, I opened up Instagram and saw that the school had posted some videos of the show online

This seemed off, so I went to talk to the Head (who controls our socials). We had a short conversation, during which I basically said, ""This is illegal"" and he said, ""Everyone does it, stop bothering me""

That might be where I should have let it go. But I started looking back through the license, and it was very clear that what he posted broke all our agreements. The license specifically states several times, ""You may not post any recordings of the performance on social media."" I talked it through with the faculty advisor, and she agreed that another email made sense. Maybe he just didn't read it through clearly enough. I didn't want the company we licensed from to strike down our agreement because we have another show on Sunday, and that would be super unfair to the cast. I thought this was what I needed to do.

I sent him an email with excerpts from our licensing agreement, clearly showing that we can't post videos. I also included some next steps that the faculty advisor and I had created for what to do to undo the damage from his posts. Soon, the day was over, and I hadn't heard anything from him other than two forwarded emails reminding the community about Sunday’s show

I just spoke to the faculty advisor, who said that she'd talked with the Head. Apparently, he said that he thought we bought a Streaming Agreement (we did... a LIVEstreaming agreement) and that if he heard about this from me again, he would cancel the Sunday show 

AITA? What he did was literally a crime under copyright law, but maybe I shouldn't have pushed him that much. If he doesn't care, it doesn't reflect on me as the student director. And I really don't want to risk the show getting canceled. I would feel so bad if the kids didn't get to perform one last time because of something stupid I did",4.0,0.04222870618104935,0,0
65,1cucwdj,WIBTA if I didn't answer any more of the questions that my work partner makes?,"I F(27) am the supervisor of ""G"" M(35). We entered the work place at around the same time and had the same training in the central offices. I will say that our workplace can improve regarding standarization, because a lot of our training was like oral tradition, just told, little things are written and clear. So at the beggining we both struggled with little details and pecularities that the system and work dynamic had. After a few weeks of training we departed to our place, where is just the 2 of us. 

At the beggining he asked A LOT, like almost everything he did, asked me before, and I helped him because we were both learning and I thought it was normal. Also, because he had a lot of experience, like 10 years, I trusted his labor. Soon enough I started to see that actually he had a lot of bad practices, and was kind of doing the bare minimum.  We work in the human health field and I am very passionate about always doing 120% for the people, because it's their health.  So, when I saw there was room for improvement I told him, but saw no change. 

Fast forward, 7 months later he still asked a LOT and I was TIREDDDD, because I knew that the information he asked was avaliable to him as well,  sometimes I think he asks just because he doesn't want to inconvenience himself with looking. Also, I started to do stuff that was his job at first because he never got to do it right. 

The part where I think Im kind of an asshole: He then told me that he was starting to teach as a side job in a university. I was ok with it as long as it didn't interfere with the current job. The classes he teaches are all in the same field as we work. So he started asking me very basic stuff that he really should know. Like, it worried me that he wasn't able to understand that basic stuff. Now the thing that bothers me is that I didnt accepted a job as a teacher, he did, and he always asks things about the classes and when he doesn't understand something  he asks me instead of reading, and I don't want to help him because I don't think he should be giving classes.

66,1cucip3,AITA for expecting a close up picture receiving my diploma? ,"
Today was my college grad for software development. Both my sisters had college grads, middle sister had a party her gf threw. But we still went to ceremony and got pictures. My sister took her for photo shoot while mom and I drove home. 
Youngest sisters grad we all went to ceremony and i threw her a party with a fancy fondant cake and decorations for her and her friends.

I missed my uni grad. I knew mom hates driving 4 hours so I tried to make it as easy as possible. I ordered my own gift, organized my own supper, expected to hang out after supper but they left early to go back to where they were staying. I knew they wanted to head home right after grad but that was OK. 

I wanted to get some pics with classmates in gown and then get some pictures in my dress nearby. 

Day of, I had to be there for 930 and it started at 1030. They didn't get there until 10 15. Would have been nice to get some pics beforehand but fine.

During the ceremony people were going up front to take pictures getting their diplomas. My turn comes and no one was there. Confused, I thanked them and sat down. 

I was upset as to why no one came up. They took pictures from the back. Of course they look terrible. I didn't pose because I had no reason to and the whole thing was over in a moment.

I was so disappointed. The only thing I wanted out of the whole thing was that picture. They said I wasn't specific so it was my fault. I had even asked them to take pictures of my friend because her guest might be unreliable. They did so She posed and their pictures of her are nicer than the ones of me.

I was upset and just wanted to get the pics over with. Got some with friends and some with them. 

Started to get some with my friend and mom takes off to truck. I figured she was gone for a smoke and would be back or wait to go elsewhere. 

We get to our car to find out they were gone to get food. No invitation or explanation. At this point I'm done and bawling. I had bare minimum expectations but even that was too high. 

Told husband to go home and her she can hit the highway. Didn't say how upset I was to avoid fighting. 

We were supposed to go out home the next day after our class supper (that I arranged). Found out my friends not going to supper so I don't want to go. Didn't want to follow through with weekend plans of going out home either. 

Mom goes to leave and said see you tomorrow. I say maybe. After she knew I was upset she backpeddled and tried to get me to go back out to get more pics but I look like shit. She then says why do you always do this. That pissed me off and I let her know exactly how I felt. (Above) How I can't even get the bare minimum support and I feel unimportant and alone. 

She loses it at me. Then shows up at my apartment screaming at me. How I'm ungrateful and calling me down to the dirt and how I ruined my own day. 

Am I the asshole?

ETA:
I'm less angry that they didn't come to the front to get the picture than I am that she left without telling me when we had plans for pictures at a secondary location. She left the venue without telling me when I thought she was just in the parking garage. It was the combination of events that showed lack of interest and care that upset me.

For context, Anna has been dating her bf for a year and a half. Jake always cracks “jokes,” that are racist, misogynistic, homophobic; disrespectful to my friends/me, controlling of Anna, accusing her of cheating(very clearly untrue reasons), totaled her car, etc. Jake and Anna fight a lot.

My friends and I tried to talk with her a while ago out of concern, as their fights take a toll on her. We told her how we love her/want her happy, and she agreed. 

Now, we all have a big group chat that contains all of us girls and their bfs. I have a gf of 6 months that everyone is aware of, and I came out to all of them last summer, which took courage. I see texts being sent in our chat one day, and Jake say, “Black people may deserve a month, but f**gots for sure don’t.” I’m infuriated. I reply asking why he felt the need to say that. He says, “How did the mothballs smell while you were in the closet?” I’m extremely upset, not because I feel it is an insult to me, but my gf. He has said things before, but this was the worst. Two of my friends tell me they’re texting Jake. He says I tried to get with Anna, and said they need to break up, which is absurdly untrue. I text Anna  how unacceptable it was of him to say something like that. All my friends verbalized to this to him, except her. She said “sorry and didn’t know why he said those things” After this, I was frustrated with her. I felt the whole thing was undermined.

Am i missing something, but if this was me, it would be such a red flag. Her responses show me how I feel doesn’t matter enough to talk to him. It makes our friendship seem unimportant and artificial. 

When I told my gf this, she said she that she is not a good friend. Is she right? I am sick of not being honest that her like my other friends. Her bf is an asshole.

68,1cuc4k1,WIBTA for not dropping out as a bridesmaid for my friends wedding as I feel she has insulted me and my boyfriend?,"I 24F have been with my boyfriend Jay 24M for 11 years. He's in med school and I am a PhD student and we have discussed getting engaged and married after our degrees, when we have jobs and can afford a house living together.

Jay and I went to college together and we were both in different friend groups, but shared lots of mutual friends including Sara 26F, who was a lot closer to me as we were college roommates but she knew Jay fairly well and she had dated his best friend at the time. Over the years, our mine and Jay's college groups have merged into one big one and we catch up a few times a year.



Sara is getting married soon and although we have drifted a bit since college, she asked me to be a bridesmaid when we met up and said she was going to sort formal invites and added me to a groupchat with the other bridesmaids. She sent me an invite in the post and I saw she had only invited me to the wedding and not Jay. Sara sent a text to say that the venue capacity was filled with close friends and her fiance had a big family so she didn't invite Jay.



At the bridal shower, I caught up with Annie from our college friend group and she was excited for us all to finally meet her husband at the engagement party, which I was taken aback by as Annie's husband is overseas in the army and none of our friend group has met him.



I don't want to make her wedding about me by asking and obviously it is her day so she picks the guestlist. I am not asking her to invite Jay or feel like she is forced to by asking her, but outside of me Sara and Jay are friends, she reached out to him a couple months back to ask to talk to Jay's sister for a job recommendation and Jay helped her then, so I was a bit confused after the bridal shower that she cut Jay out for close friends and family, but Annie's husband made the cut even though she has never met him. I have agreed to be a bridesmaid and don't know if I should drop out for Jay but don't want to cause a fuss, and all of us have Sara's parents have a holiday home which we are staying in for her bachelorette and I have booked plane tickets for that and bought a bridesmaid dress. I'm not sure what to do, as bringing up Jay not being invited is awkward.

70,1cuc2bd,AITA for looking up spoilers to movies and tv shows even though it bothers my boyfriend?,"Tldr: I look up spoilers to media, this ruins my boyfriend's watching experience but I don't tell him the spoilers.

I LOVE spoilers, or just knowing what's coming up on a show or movie or book. Even if it's something silly like a sitcom, I enjoy looking at the wiki for what's going to happen in the episodes.

I never tell anybody what I've read or spoil anything for them and my friends/fam never even knew I'd look stuff up beforehand until conversations about spoilers/hating spoilers etc. came up.

My bf hates that I do this because he says that it ruins the experience of watching things together for the first time, because I'm not experiencing it at the same time as him.

Since he told me that, I don't look up spoilers/the wiki for things I know he's excited to watch. And I've stopped doing it for mysteries because he likes to work it out together. And I put my phone away so he knows I'm not.

But looking up spoilers makes the experience better for me, and since I don't spoil it for him I don't think I need to stop completely and still do it for random things/when I want to.

But he keeps asking me before every show or movie if I've looked stuff up, even if it's just a random tv movie he doesn't care about.

We had an argument yesterday after he once again said this. I told him I don't want to stop doing it for every single thing we ever happen to watch together, and that I don't understand why he cares so much since I don't tell him what happens or give it away with my face etc.

He says I'm the asshole for this because I continue to do it knowing he hates it and I'm being inconsiderate. Most of my friends and family agree with him, and say that I should stop doing it for all movies/shows because it's strange/unusual and I know it bothers him.

71,1cuc0q2,AITA for not taking down a tiktok post after it hurt my mom's feelings?,"I'm 20F and I grew up overweight. As a result I went through the classic growing up with parents that turned every conversation into a weight conversation. I know my parents were worried about me but the more they pushed the worse my eating got. My first diet was at 11 and was strictly salads and eggs. Then at 15 I starved myself and for the first time in my life my parents didn't comment on my weight. Then I gained it all back and all the comments, but worse. I reached my largest at 275lbs almost 2 years ago, and have since been slowly working it down. I currently stand at 235lbs.

Anyways, around a year ago there was a tiktok trend where you post the reason why you workout. It's the best way I have of explaining it. I posted a slideshow with the captions ""Behind every lift... every workout.... is a girl who just wanted her mom to stop commenting on her body.""

Maybe a month or two after posting I got a text from my older sister who saw it on some public fitness snapchat story. She asked if that was me, I said yes, and that was the end of it. I guess within the past few weeks tiktok trends from a year ago have started circulating Facebook.

My mom sent me a text a few days ago asking if that was me. I said yes and then didn't hear from her until this morning. First my dad texted me asking if I would take it down because my mom has been really distressed over it. I'll be honest, I've been able to stand up to my mom about her treatment of me in the past, but it's hard to have a conversation with her about our past when she refuses to recall any of it.

When she attended one of my therapy sessions in high school she went from not remembering the diet at 11, to it sounded like something she'd do, and finally talking to my doctor and being suggested that horribly restrictive diet.

Now my siblings are upset with me and it's only a matter of time before extended family heats about it.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"AITA for not taking down a tiktok post after it hurt my mom's feelings? I'm 20F and I grew up overweight. As a result I went through the classic growing up with parents that turned every conversation into a weight conversation. I know my parents were worried about me but the more they pushed the worse my eating got. My first diet was at 11 and was strictly salads and eggs. Then at 15 I starved myself and for the first time in my life my parents didn't comment on my weight. Then I gained it all back and all the comments, but worse. I reached my largest at 275lbs almost 2 years ago, and have since been slowly working it down. I currently stand at 235lbs.

Anyways, around a year ago there was a tiktok trend where you post the reason why you workout. It's the best way I have of explaining it. I posted a slideshow with the captions ""Behind every lift... every workout.... is a girl who just wanted her mom to stop commenting on her body.""

Maybe a month or two after posting I got a text from my older sister who saw it on some public fitness snapchat story. She asked if that was me, I said yes, and that was the end of it. I guess within the past few weeks tiktok trends from a year ago have started circulating Facebook.

My mom sent me a text a few days ago asking if that was me. I said yes and then didn't hear from her until this morning. First my dad texted me asking if I would take it down because my mom has been really distressed over it. I'll be honest, I've been able to stand up to my mom about her treatment of me in the past, but it's hard to have a conversation with her about our past when she refuses to recall any of it.

When she attended one of my therapy sessions in high school she went from not remembering the diet at 11, to it sounded like something she'd do, and finally talking to my doctor and being suggested that horribly restrictive diet.

I refused to take it down because many people have been able to share their stories in the comments of that post.

72,1cubqx9,WIBTA if I ask for some form of repayment after boyfriend's drug addict brother/his gf stole money from me?,"Basically what the title says. I just moved in with my boyfriend. His brother and his brother's girlfriend live there too. They are both meth/fetanyl addicts. I had boxes in the garage since I can't really unpack as my bf's brother's girlfriend is a hoarder and her stuff is everywhere. She has been putting things in storage and making room but there's still so much in the house. They have two rooms: the brother's room and she has her own. She does not pay rent btw but the brother does. Anyway, a few things have happened since I moved in. The first thing was that my case for my important personal documents was open in the living room (not how I left it) and the girlfriend's vape was right next to it. She has been to jail multiple times for cashing fake checks and attempting to steal identities. A few weeks later I went to my bf's mom's house to spend time with her and she informed me that the brother came to her house and took a ton of rolled up coins and some money out of her safe. This would have been the last straw for me but my bf keeps saying ""he's my brother. I can't just kick him out"". I let it go and kept an eye on my things. Now back to the boxes in the garage. The girlfriend moved all of my boxes around and found that I had a change jar in one of them that i forgot about. Inside was a few origami rings made of money. Three $1, one $2 and one $100. The $100 was missing. I looked in every nook and cranny of the box and could not find it. The jar was not tipped over either. The top of the jar was placed to the side in the box.

I was also going to let this go even though I know I shouldn't but now the girlfriend has been texting my bf's mom saying that the house is messy and it's my fault?!?! Basically she's trying to start something to make me look like the bad guy I guess? And she's trying to get other people involved. I'm guessing that maybe she thinks that they won't have to leave if people think I'm the jerk in the whole situation? I'm not really sure honestly. These drugs are insane. I guess at this point my question is WIBTA for demanding that they immediately be kicked out and that I be repaid for the money they took? The brother has lots of warhammer figures and expensive magic the gathering cards both of which I have just gotten into. Would it be wrong to demand $100 worth of stuff? Is that just petty and should I just focus on putting my foot down about them staying there.

My mom told me that when my dad leaves, I should send some of my stuff with him because she is concerned it will not all fit in two cars on move-out day. I agreed immediately. I did not protest or say maybe or no. My mom then goes on to explain why it is important that he takes my stuff, explaining how stressful it will be if we can not fit it all, how embarrassing it might be, etc. She talks for a while about it, and I listen.  
The conversation moves on. I am talking about a job interview I just had when she returns to explaining why it is important to send stuff home with my dad. I listen. She talks about it for another seven minutes uninterrupted. Again, I agree. I do not protest anything.

75,1cubcjr,"WIBTA If I taunt my bf's ""friends"" back?","All fake names


So my bf, let's call him Jake, is a sweetheart. Though he is capable of standing up for himself, he often ignores it when people are casually rude to him.

So he has this friends group, not close though. Some people left to other cities and some new ones joined over the last years. Out of the older ones still remaining here, Dave and Beth were in a relationship. Dave cheated on Beth with a new girl Kim. And the whole new friend group ostracised Beth because Dave portrayed her as clingy, crazy and obsessed with him. Well, Jake was a close friend to Beth and he is the only one who still is friends with her. Naturally, the rest of the group cut him out too but very slowly. Jake is not too bothered about that though.

That's just the background. Now the main point is Jake started to hang out with my friend group once in a while, went on a couple of trips. When his ""friends"" found out, they were casually taunting him about not hanging out with them but with me and my friends when they don’t even include him in anything at all. Jake let it slide. These people end up going to a trip every couple of months apart from all the partying. Last week when they were leaving on one such trip, we happened to come across them at the city bus station. After pleasantries one of them chirped in to say that since Jake never goes with them anymore that's why they did not tell him. We did not even ask anything about their trip or why Jake wasn't informed. The audacity! 

To be fair, they get to do whatever they want but they do not get to taunt Jake about not hanging out with them when they were the ones to push the people out who called out Dave during the whole cheating fiasco. We have always been civil with them and never retorted back. But it has got too much. The next time something like this happens, I don't think I'll hold my tongue anymore.

A few months ago, her extremely impulsive and irresponsible sister, who just recently rescued a 1 year old dog Chewey, dropped her dog off at our home. Nat and I actually insisted she does that, because she didn’t want a responsibility of a dog anymore and was trying to find a way to abandon him somewhere. Nat and I’s original plan was, we’ll take the dog in, and find him a loving home that’ll actually want him. However recently, whenever a possible new home comes up, Nat has been finding ways to not give Chewey up and eventually told me she wants to keep him, but I am insistent on giving him up.

I have a few reasons for this: we financially and physically cannot afford the responsibilities that comes with owning another dog, especially one that is so young and needs a lot of training.

Chewey also has a lot of energy, as well as health and behavioral problems, is not trained at all and chews everything he can see.

Also, Chewey broke his leg running into the road a month after we had him, and that cost us a $5,000. On top of that, Chewey also has a bunch of medical problems, so we know to anticipate a few more thousands in pet medical bills in the next year (that is after insurance). We have financial goals to go back to school and pay off debts that I do not want to delay.

When it comes to food, we usually cook together so we split 50/50 on the groceries. This week I had to travel for academic reasons, so I went to our country's capital. We love Asian food so I came back this morning with $100 worth of condiments, noodles (mostly NOT the instant ones), preserved vegetables, and spices. I paid everything myself, she didn't contribute a dime.

I also took some snacks and fermented soybeans for myself.

I answered: ""On the packaging, it's in Japanese so use your phone to translate it"". She asked for translations she could understand, but I had removed them before hitting the road. Everything I bought had their translated list of ingredients removed.

She got angry because she obviously has never heard of Google Lens (And I'm not telling her about it) but she wants to know what's in my fermented soybeans she's not going to eat anyway. I pointed out that she never respected my wishes so I took matters in my own hand, and she stood there dumbfounded for half a second before saying ""I'm doing that for your own good, you need to understand basic nutrition and what's good or not for you."" completely ignoring the fact I had biweekly nutrition classes with a dietician when I was in middle school.

All of this was ordered during a divorce a decade ago. My ex adopted my oldest child (while we were married), they are not the biological parent.  This was not my idea or my request was 100% my ex's idea (this is where I get to feeling guilty about the child support). The biological parent had minimal to no presence in my kid's life but was on child support before the adoption.
My ex continued to help raise both children after the separation/divorce however there was always favoritism issues. But overall co-parenting and things were typical, no issues.  A couple years ago oldest has altercation with my ex  resulting  in her not wanting to go back there.  It was a situation where CPS got involved. I now have the oldest full time.   In that time the ex has not attempted to make any amends, apologize or fix their relationship with them. 

 Prior to this I was already struggling financially with how expensive teens are then add inflation. I feel defeated financially, I make sure the kids have all they need and make my needs the 2nd priority, maintain our home on a single income and earning some side money when I can. The child support I do get just barely covers what I pay for insurance premiums every month. I'll be honest it pains me seeing the other party get to take trips, cover themselves in tattoos, buy new vehicles and boats when I can't buy myself new glasses because both the kids need theirs or can't make my dentist appt because I put priority on the kids appointments over mine financially.

 I decided now, due to the change in timesharing in addition to changes in finances (original judgment is 10 years old) I needed to file for modification.  My hang up is I fight my own guilt for it, empathically I consider how they adopted and cared for a kid that wasn't theirs, I almost feel as if I'm punishing a good deed.  However I realize they made a promise to my child that they haven't kept, which was to be their parent, support them and keep them safe/loved.

84,1cuai2m,AITA for not visiting my mom for Mother's Day?,"I (36m) live 2 hours away from my single mom (73f). I'm her youngest, & 2 of her other kids (41m & 48f) live close to her & have spouses & kids. I have a wife & no kids.

Historically, I occasionally drive up to her place for the weekend, spending Saturday & sometimes Friday nights, then going back home Sunday evening.

A couple weeks ago, I offered to visit her for Mothers Day weekend. During that same phone call she asked my opinion about getting a backup generator. I said I'd be happy to help her research & shop around during my visit.

A few days before Mothers Day Friday, she texted me:

""Would you be willing to & able to come up for Mother's Day the weekend after? \[Granddaughter\] has both her dance recitals & I planned on attending both but that would cut half the day out of our generator project.""

I agreed.

The Thursday evening before the visit, the following text conversation happened:

ME: How do you feel about me coming up late tomorrow? Like, probably around midnight?

HER: That's a bit of a strange question because you know I'd rather you come sooner so that I can have more time with you, but if you can't come any sooner than that then why would asking me make a difference? I'm a little confused.

ME: I shall clarify: is midnight too late at night for my arrival to the point where it will be disruptive, and if so, what is the cut-off time for your comfort?

(She’s a night-owl & sleeps ‘til noon)

HER: Oh, that's completely different. No midnight is not too late to arrive to not be disruptive. What have you got going on? Do you even have time to come up this weekend. If something has changed, let me know.

ME: I'm offering to come up late Friday night so that we can have all of Saturday to do whatever chores you need my help with throughout the day, and then Sunday we can relax and play some games or something before I need to head home in the later afternoon / early evening Sunday. If you'd rather wait until a weekend where I can come up earlier on a Friday, that's fine. We can reschedule.

HER: Well, originally, I had been thinking that we would spend Friday evening researching on the Internet stuff about the generators before we went out on Saturday to Shop for & hopefully buy one. I sleep so late that half the day is gone by the time I get up & moving, but if you think we can do it all on Saturday then let's still go for it. I definitely am anxious to see you, but unless you've already done all that type of researching stuff then maybe we should pick a different weekend so we have time to either research it before we get together or can research it together on a Friday night. Those are just my thoughts let me know what you think.

ME: Alright, well it sounds like it makes the most sense for me to come up when I have more time so we don't have to rush anything and can give it due diligence. Let's re-address our calendars after Memorial Day.

86,1cu9qib,WIBTA if I asked my gf to rethink her job choice for our relationship's sake?,"Me (f21) and my girlfriend (f21) have moved in a small town to attend nursing school.

She got accepted and is currently a student, I didn't but I'm planning on retrying next year. In the meantime, I found myself a job so I don't have to weight on my parents shoulders.

She is unemployed mostly because of how nursing school works. It's just a 3 years programme and after that you're a nurse. This means that these 3 years are pretty intense. She can't skip classes because presence is mandatory, and she has classes from 9am/7pm with just one hour break to have lunch. She also has a TON of exams and also, the day after finishing the lessons of the trimester they start working full time at a hospital as trainees (unpaid).

She's currently at that stage where she has the same shifts as an actual nurse and when she gets home, she's obviously very tired. However she has to set aside that tiredness to study for her exams.

Going back to our story, I work in a fast food. I do shitty invasive shifts that take away half of my days, and when it's busy there's also times where I leave home at 9am and come back at midnight. However it's for my own choice, because some of my coworker are students and only work when they can, even just 2 days a week.

So me and my gf are both very busy and our shifts don't always work together. This affected our life as a couple, we not so often get to spend quality time together because when we meet, we're usually either too tired to do anything or it's just the time to eat and sleep. Even our sex life has died a bit. But we're still managing to not neglect each other too much and get going.

However recently my gf has started to think about working a part time at my old job while also continuing her studies. My older job was another fast food but bigger, with more invasive shifts and overall a worse working environment. She knew about it because I complained about it with her before leaving.

I asked her why would she decide to get a job there when she could apply where I'm currently working at, she told me it's because my older job is closer to our home.

We discussed it a little bit but then we stopped talking when we realised the conversation would've shifted into an argument.

The thing is if she applied where I work at, sure it would be further away from our home, but we would spend so much more time together and her schedule as a student would be accommodated. She could ask for a on-call contract like my coworkers and work whenever she can.
My other job does not do these type of contracts for students so she would have to work at least 20h per week.

Our relationship is already affected by our current jobs, I think if she applied there it would destroy us. I am also a little hurt by the fact that it seems like she didn't even consider this issue.

87,1cu9gye,AITA for telling my friend that poverty is not a personality trait?,"My (15F) best friend (15F) comes from a very underprivileged background. Her father is in prison, while her mother is unemployed and on benefits, and she lives in a small council flat with her siblings. She has been working since she was 13, and currently has a job at a fast food chain.

Both of us have scholarships to attend a very posh private school. I have a regular, working class family, my mother's an interior designer and my father works in real estate. The rest of our friends are middle class or upper middle class, so while I admit that I'll never understand what it's like to walk in my friend's shoes, to a lesser extent I get what it's like to feel out of place in this environment.

My friend constantly makes self deprecating jokes about how broke she is, and every single time it makes things really awkward and people try to change the subject. Yesterday when I was walking to the metro with her and 5 other friends, we stopped by this small coffee shop to get some drinks. While we were walking out, she tripped and grabbed onto me for balance, and I instinctively jumped back, causing her to drop her cappuccino. I apologised for the accident, although I don’t really think it’s my fault she tripped. She then started asking me to give her £2 as a repayment for the coffee. I refused since I didn’t make her trip in the first place. I said it’s only £2 it’s not the end of the world.

She kept on badgering me about the money and started getting mad over it. She started yelling at me, saying that her family’s broke and she isn’t lucky enough to be privileged like the rest of us. I told her that poverty isn’t a personality trait and she had to stop using it to manipulate us into doing what she says. She stormed off in anger. Now people I barely even talk to are blowing up my phone because she told everyone that I was making fun of her for being poor.

88,1cu8wfc,AITA for refusing to split the cost of a surprise trip for my birthday after we broke up?,"Me 25F and my boyfriend James 27M have been together 1.5 years and are long distance right now. Before this he was a great boyfriend and we had discussed getting married. I was a postgrad student so he was the breadwinner when we met, until I graduated and landed a job that pays more than he earns. We have always split our expenses proportional to income, with me now paying more.

I had a big falling out with James last month, after our mutual friend Jane 26F divorced our other friend Dan 24M after finding out he had an affair. The 4 of us are part of a bigger friend group made of couples, and our friend group split when Jane found out some of them knew about Dan's affair and kept quiet. I didn't know of the affair, and was upset when I found James knew about Dan's affair and kept it a secret out of loyalty to Dan.

His lack of morals and his genuine confusion at why Jane doesn't want to be friends with him or why I am upset over his actions is why we broke up. James doesn't understand why I am making a big deal over this and for weeks after we broke up begged me to reconsider. It has been really awkward in our friend group with first Adam and Jane splitting and our group dividing into two and since then the group has gotten smaller as I split with James.

He then went radio silent, and messaged me about sorting our expenses. As we are long distance we pay rent/groceries separately, but James comes to visit me once a month for a weekend/few days as my job doesn't allow me to visit him. Plane tickets are expensive, so we usually split the ticket cost, with me paying more. James had planned to suprise me for my upcoming birthday and bought tickets for a week long trip.

He wants me to compensate him for the tickets in the normal proportion I usually cover, but I don't think this is fair as he booked those tickets are we aren't together anymore. He called me and was upset as the tickets aren't refundable/exchangeable and if he does use them he has no place to stay as I won't let him in becuase I am being stubborn. I am only considering paying to keep the peace especially since our friend group has suffered, but my sister thinks I should just block him and find new friends in my area.

89,1cu8v92,AITA for shouting at my friend for showing off using my child?,"I (35f) have a friend group of five women (including me). We are all the same age and we have been friends since we were 13. Four of us me included have kids, with my five week old son being the youngest. The fifth friend Emily (fake name) doesn't have kids and hasn't really ever been in a relationship that lasted longer than a couple of weeks. Emily works in a day care centre and has been working there for over 10 years. Nowadays she mainly does admin work but sometimes covers shifts if someone is sick. So she has a lot of experience with kids even though she doesn't have any herself. 

The problem with Emily is that she likes to make it known how good she is with kids. So when ever we spend time together as a group with our kids she acts like she knows best when it comes to kids. For example if a kid is having a tantrum she will insert herself in the situation instead of letting the mom take care of it. Or if a child is doing something it shouldn't like eating too much candy, Emily will tell the child ""Don't listen to mommy, auntie Emily says it's fine"". She also does this at bigger gatherings showing off her superior skills with kids while making us look like we don't know anything. I've talked about this with the other moms and they find it annoying aswell. We thought about saying something but we agreed that taking care of children is such a big part of Emily's identity that it would really hurt her.

On to the problem at hand. Couple of days ago we were hanging out again. Emily asked if she could hold my son and I said yes. A little later the baby started to cry. I went over and tried to take him back. Emily wouldn't let me and kept saying she knows how to do it and tries rocking the baby. I knew my son was hungry so no amount of rocking was going to stop him from crying. I asked Emily again just to give me the baby and she again refused. I was getting upset and asked again and she just kept saying that she knows how to take care of a baby. I said I know but I need to take my baby. I was about to blow but she had my son in her arms so I didn't want to upset her. Suddenly she tried to take the baby to the other room but I stopped her and almost forcefully took my son from her. I was seething and once I had set my son down, I let it all out. I shouted at her that she has no right to keep me from my child and that even with all her experience she can't go over me when it comes to my child. I also told her that I'm sick of her trying to show off her skills using my child. She was really upset and left shortly after. 

I don't think anything I said was wrong but AITA for shouting at her? My friends think it's something she needed to hear but going of on her like that might have been too much

90,1cu8um7,WIBTA for refusing to let my MIL take my preschooler away for the week,"I (38f) and my husband (35m) have a son  (4m). My MIL lives overseas and is visiting for a couple of months for other business. She has never met her grandson in person, and obviously wants to spend time with him. 

She knows how stressful raising kids alone is, and has offered to take our son away for the week to give us a bit of a break. This wouldnt be an issue is she didn't want to take him more than 3 hours away. My DH is fine with the idea as he knows how stressed and tired I am, but as a mother who has never been away from her child for more than a few hours, its a hard sell. I understand it would be good for us as a couple for our mental health, but my biggest issue is that its so far away with people he has never met. So WIBTA if I refused to let my MIL take my son on holiday? 

Points for clarification:

We have no family in the area. My mother used to live nearby, but she passed away from cancer in 2020. We have our fathers but both are in ill health and we wouldnt want to place any burden on them as well as there also being a long distance between us. Our siblings are also all too far away. We are basically isolated since late mother passing and are pretty much alone raising our son. I understand she is offering out of kindness, but its hard to feel positive about it.

Its also important to note that our son is also on the autism assessment pathway, though it may also have no bearing on a 4yo being separated from his mum for a week.

Edit for grammar: I was in a bit of a rush to work when I wrote this! 

UPDATE: I have spoke to my husband about my worries and shown him this post. Sometimes he needs an outside perspective. He now agrees with my stance and has told MIL that while her offer is generous and well intentioned, we wont be taking her up on it. Were now making plans for her to come to us for that week and having a day/night once everyone is a more comfortable. 

Id like to thank everyone sincerely for the comments, it helped my husband to realise the stance he had initially, while well intentioned, would do more harm than good.

91,1cu8qab,AITA for suggesting my gf’s relationship with her brother is creepy?,"I don’t post, but I need to get this out. My partner (31F) & I (32F) have been together 6 years & just got engaged. Her family has normalized alcoholism, so while that was a problem early on in our relationship, she’s really grown & hardly drinks anymore. However, when she visits she gets drunk & lies to me about it. Her brother (28M) is also gay but has always made me uncomfortable. When we first started dating he’d freak out every time we were together & send her 100s of texts always in crisis. They went on a fam vacation & he posted pictures of her butt (in a swimsuit but zoomed in) on Snapchat. He tried to break us up constantly. He told her family I was abusing her. We got in arguments about it because it seemed like she’d jump to his defense & get mad for saying anything about his behavior, but with couples counseling, she started to see what he was doing & started to pull back from him. Now it comes in waves. Sometimes they barely talk. Smetimes, when he comes back & lives with their parents, he sucks her back into the drama, codependency, alcoholism. She tells me they barely talk but I constantly see him blowing up her phone. They talk every day she doesn’t have any friends & it worries me that he’s the only constant in her life. Last night she was in the shower and I saw about a dozen messages come through from him & I looked. Maybe I shouldn’t have? We give each other our phones & don’t feel like we have anything to hide, but something in my gut told me she wasn’t telling me everything. I saw messages talking about drinking last weekend when she was there that she had lied to me about. They were planning on drinking together before she even got there. She knows it’s been an insecurity of mine that she just goes there to drink and hang out with him. She tells me that’s not true that she wants to hang out with her parents & he kinda does his own thing, but I see that’s a lie. He’s so problematic & I feel like she acts like such a different person around him. He calls her pet names & sends her kissy faces. Honestly the way he talks to her, feels relationshipy. I don’t have siblings so I don’t understand sibling dynamics, but this feels icky. He’s very hypersexual & told me once that he was questioning if he might be bi & not just gay. Sometimes I feel like he treats her like his partner. I feel gross even suggesting it. I told her it feels like emotional incest. She’s been internalizing since we talked about it. She withdraws a lot, that’s normal, but sometimes when I bring this stuff up, I feel like she pushes me away. Should I have even said anything? Am I just reading into normal sibling dynamics that I just don’t understand?

What sealed the deal for me leaving was the fact that she again yelled at me for walking in front of her AFTER she died in her game. (Her set up was in the middle of the walkway to the door.) I’m coming back after Wednesday and taking my stuff into my parents garage. Your comments have definitely helped, they helped me understand that while I was still partly an asshole she was more of one.",0.0,0.08780713379383087,0,1

95,1cu87kz,"AITA for asking my mum to ditch her date for my brother visiting from abroad? She says I'm being controlling and that she ""deserves happiness too.""","My (32) mum (55) lives in the UK, and my older brother (34) just flew in from the US for a rare visit. We were excited to see her, but when I asked if she could join us on Saturday, she said she was ""busy"" with friends. Knowing her vague excuses usually mean dates, I pressed a little further. Turns out, she's going on an overnight trip with a new boyfriend – someone she's only been seeing for six weeks!

Here's the thing: this isn't a one-off. My mum has a history of prioritising new partners over her kids. She's been married and divorced three times (with two kids from each marriage), and her dating life has often been chaotic. Some of these relationships have involved bad characters. One ended with a restraining order after the guy punched my younger sister in the face. Sadly, I'm not joking. It's been stressful on all of us, especially my younger siblings who've had to deal with men they barely know moving into the house.

There's a pattern here. My mum tends to rush into relationships, and this new guy is no exception. According to my sisters, they already broke up once because he was making misogynistic comments and lied about smoking weed (something my mum hates) – all within those six weeks! Apparently, she forgave him after he called it ""work banter."" This is just the latest in a string of concerning choices.

Things get even messier because my brother actually bought her a plane ticket to visit him in the US in September! He was terrified to bring up how upset he felt, worried she'll cancel on him too (she doesn't do calm discussions). That's why I decided to confront her. It felt weird how evasive she was about her plans, and honestly, the moment she got vague, all six of us knew it was a date.

Our text conversation went like this:

>**Me:** Are you able to come on Saturday? I know X would love you to be there. 

>**Her:** No, definitely not. I'm sorry, but I'm busy. 

>**Me:** Oh no! Did they make you work? 

>**Her:** No, I'm seeing friends. 

>**Me:** (skeptical) Who are you hanging out with? 

>**Her:** I'm going to X place (4 hours from where we live). That's why it's difficult. With a boyfriend who I haven't really mentioned because it's early days... 6 weeks actually. I've already cancelled on him twice before.

I asked whether she could reschedule, and told her that my brother (and me!) would like to see her. She then rang me and I said, ""Look, we're just upset because X is rarely back home and won't see you for a long time. Given this is a new relationship and he's local, could you please reschedule?"". She says she can't reschedule, she's cancelled twice before, and then I told her I disagreed with her decision, which is when it got heated. Honestly, I feel like I don't know what normal is anymore. I just wish I had the relationship with my mum that my friends have with theirs.

So, Reddit, am I the A\*\*hole for asking her to prioritise her son who rarely gets to see her over a new boyfriend of six weeks? She insists I'm being controlling and that she deserves happiness too. But shouldn't there be a balance?

96,1cu830x,AITA for planning a second birthday party after my boyfriend disregarded what I wanted? ,"My boyfriend, I’ll call him Alex, wanted to plan my birthday dinner this year. I was not keen on this because I hate making a big scene and he likes it, also, I had a restaurant in mind already…basically I knew what I wanted and I just wanted to do that. Alex said he at least wanted to plan/host it. I said okay. 

I gave him all the information on what I wanted. Mind you, my dad always pays for my birthday dinners (we’re not big on gifts so he normally just picks up the tab for whatever celebration I have instead), so when I had thought about what I wanted budget had not been an issue. 

Alex was very secretive during the planning but he said I would love what he planned and considering I had written out a full page of what I wanted I didn’t think anything of it. 

But when he drove me to the dinner, it was at a completely different restaurant, one I don’t hate but certainly not where I’d want my birthday, he’d invited some of his friends who I don’t like, and had decorated the table even though we were eating in the main part of the restaurant which drew unnecessary attention. I was horrified. I went into the bathroom, had a little cry, and then pretended to have a fun evening, even though all my friends knew this would upset me. 

I told Alex afterwards how upset I was and he was offended. He said he couldn’t afford the party I wanted so he’d planned an alternative which I think is a stupid excuse because I never asked him to pay. Eventually I settled it saying I appreciated the effort but in future I will be planning my own events. 

So I did. I planned a do-over dinner at the place I wanted, with the guest list I wanted, and the menu I wanted. 

Alex is really mad about this, saying it’s embarrassing for him. I think he had the dinner he wanted - because a dinner that didn’t take into account what I wanted was not for me - and now I’m having the dinner I want.

I will tighten my belt another notch and try to pay them back faster. I want to clarify though, that I'm not mooching off them. I have a job, I pay rent while I'm here and will be repaying the loan when I move out. I'm paying for daycare, and I help with the groceries. Yes, I'm incredibly privileged and lucky and I know it, but I do appreciate what they're doing for me.

UPDATE: I should have put this, but I do have a repayment plan on place. It's only $700/month, but I don't make a lot.


I think I am probably the asshole here, but I'm hoping not. I (39f) have been living with my parents (mid 60's) for the last year while I go through a horrible divorce. I have 50/50 custody of my girls (2 and 4f) whom my parents are helping me with while I'm there. My parents just loaned me $85,000 to buy a condo, interest free. The problem is that they feel that while I'm repaying this, I don't really have the right to buy anything they consider frivolous or unnecessary. This includes things like new clothes, books, craft supplies, basically anything fun. Even things like new curtains for the condo, because they have working blinds, even if they are ugly and kind of gross.

I'm used to spending my money as I please, because it's mine. If I want a new outfit, I used to have the cash to buy it. But I've had to cut way back in the last year for obvious reasons, and it's been really hard but I've sort of managed it. Now my parents have basically said, no more fun money at all, not even fast food, while I owe them for the house.

My initial thought was, it's my money and if I can afford it I can buy it at my discretion. But my sister and even my counselor are more on my mom's side, which makes me think I'm probably in the wrong.

The problem - my Fiances brother and wife.

Throughout the early years of our relationship we used to collectively visit Fiances brother and then girlfriend, and I thought things were fine at first but after a while I felt unwelcome and not acknowledged. They used to make excuses to do other things in another room and leave me and my Fiance sitting alone. This never happened when my Fiance visits without me. For context, and despite us living with each other, my daughter or I have never received a birthday or Christmas card or any form of acknowledgment. This upsets me more so, considering Fiance buys for all three of their children and they cannot buy for one. Daughter is only 7 years old and should not be treated nor singled out the way she has been.

Their actions in the past have left me feeling very unwelcome, for example, at their wedding I must have been the only guest to not be asked to participate in photos. My Fiance received tickets for a play from them for his birthday one year and was urged to not take me. All these things along with the blatant arrogance and rudeness have left me feeling very pushed out. It went as far as when we got engaged, we received no congratulations from them which left my fiance very upset.

My Fiance has openly admitted he has buried his head in the sand and did not want to see what was happening, and it was only down to me that he confronted them and asked what the problem was - which we still don't really know. He now sees where I am coming from and how I have been made to feel for the last 6 1/2 years.

I have made peace with it all and accept my fiance wants a relationship with his brothers children, and ideally his brother and his wife as well. However all that being said, after the last 6 1/2 years I now don't feel the need to want to get along with them anymore. I am at the point where their actions have been so deliberately hurtful, if I had the choice I would not invite them to our wedding with the fear of them ruining the day.

101,1cu7hpq,WIBTA if I split the house bills evenly four ways between four people?,"The situation is exactly as the title says.
The house bills consist of rent, electric, water, gas, and internet.

There are four people living in one house: me (person A who dictates how much is paid), person B, person C, and person D.

Persons C and D are a couple.

Before person D moved in everything was split three ways as it was fair. When they did move in they only had a job for a little bit and due to circumstances lost it.
Because of person C being bad with money (different topic completely) and after discussing it over with person B to see if they were okay with it, I opted to still keep everything split three ways even though I approached person C about them paying for their part plus person D's part and they said they'd be okay with doing it.
I was trying to help given the circumstances.

Fast forward, person D now has a job. I made mention that since they have a job we could now split everything four ways.

This is where the WIBTA comes in.

Persons C and D do not see it that way. They think that because they are a couple, one unit/entity, that the only things to be split four ways are the electric and water as those are the only things to fluctuate. Everything else is to continue to be split three ways.
Truth be told I think they'd rather keep it split three ways in general but l digress.
To a very small extent I can kind of see what they are saying but I disagreed and said that I don't see it that way, that four people are working so four people should split everything.

They tried to say that if I, hypothetically, moved a couple in and it's just me and the couple that I should split things 50/50 because the couple are one and not two. I said if they both had jobs then things would get split three way.

We had a small argument and things ended with everything being split four ways with person C paying both their parts.

So WIBTA in this situation?

We had a small argument and things ended with everything being split four ways with person C paying both their parts.

So WIBTA in this situation?


Edit: To add a bit of context because I did not think about it beforehand, this is a four bedroom house. 
Persons C and D do share a room but kids of person D have a room as well. I hope this helps give a little more insight.",0.0,0.9821382164955139,1,0
102,1cu7dyk,AITA for ignoring our daughter’s inconvenient boundary?,"My wife (39f) and I (36f) have a daughter (technically my stepdaughter but I’ve raised her since she was 5) (19f) from a previous relationship of my wife’s (her father is not in the picture) who has come back home after her first year at uni. She’s picked up a new (and problematic) issue since she was last home for an extended period of time, surrounding laundry.

Basically, she has established a “boundary” where nobody is to touch her clothes. Her reasoning is that she’s concerned something will go missing/get damaged, thinks it’s just gross for us to go through her stuff, and is an adult who deserves privacy. All fine, we have 3 young children in our home (9f, 9f and 2m) so plenty of washing to keep us entertained.

The issue is that she has a habit of monopolising washing facilities to the extent where we’re effectively prevented from being able to get any other laundry done. For example, last weekend she put a wash in before work and hung it out on the line at around 11am. She then left for work (12pm-10pm) - her wash was dry within an hour, and obviously she wasn’t going to be back all day. We had a few days worth of washing to get through, so my wife (her mum) took everything off the line and folded it. We got through 5 other loads that day.

She was NOT happy when she got home, and said that she’d been very clear that we weren’t to touch her things. When we explained the situation above, she said it was “first come, first served” (not something we’ve ever said) and that since the next day was due to be nice also, we should’ve just waited to get through it the next day. That really pissed us off.

We’ve offered her a weekly laundry day, where we’ll avoid using the machines so she can have freedom to do as she pleases on that day, but she said once a week won’t cut it. Fair enough, but there are 5 other people in the house that need clean clothes/bedding/towels. Other than that all we can really suggest is that she keeps on top of her washing. If she’s at home we’ll ask her to clear her clothes from the machine/dryer/washing line as needed, but like any 19 year old she has a social life/work commitments and is often busy.

She’s upset because she says we’re not respecting her boundaries, whereas we’ve pointed out that while “don’t move my clothes” is objectively reasonable, it’s not fair for her to do so at the inconvenience of everyone else in our home. Essentially the last conversation we had ended up with her in tears because we said as long as situations like Saturday keep occurring, we’ll continue to move her stuff. Just FYI, we do fold her clothes carefully, and leave them in a basket in a communal living area so they’re kept together, in good condition, and we’re not going in and out of her room.

We normally have a good relationship with her, so this is all a bit unusual. We’ve asked her if everything else is okay, and she says yes and seems otherwise normal in and of herself, and she’s normally reasonable so - are we being unreasonable?

EDIT: So the consensus is pretty much that we’re right, and our daughter is being massively unreasonable, and that we’re being pushovers for not being tougher on her from the off. We‘ve shown her the comments, and unfortunately she’s still insisting that we’re the unreasonable ones.

We’d never considered the local laundromat, and have banned her from using our washing machine for the next fortnight given she’s still unwilling to adjust. She‘a absolutely FURIOUS, and wife has ordered a lock for the washroom door to enforce the 2 week rule. Hopefully a couple of weeks hauling her stuff to and from will help her see the light. Thanks very much all!!

  
EDIT 2: A slightly calmer update this morning. Our daughter came to talk to us, and apologised for the situation. She said she had found the transition back home hard (I get that) and had maybe become a bit territorial over her stuff while at uni. All okay. She then asked if she could please have a laundry day, and be allowed to use the machine. Her place of work is closed Mondays, so that’s now “her” day, and we’ve said that she can use the machine on other days - but if by 7am Tuesday there’s anything in the way (or any issues on any other days!) we’ll be moving her stuff. A genuine sorry goes a long way with us, and while the advice has been to hold firm, we don’t really want an issue if the situation can be resolved calmly. We’ve also made it clear that if her things DO have to be moved on any day (other than Monday which is totally hers) and we get ANY grief about it, we’ll go back to a 2 week ban and there’s no going back. 

Maybe a less satisfying update than the last one, but we’re happy we can resolve the problem calmly.

It used to be that I would do BuzzFeed quizzes or look at TikToks with her, or just chat until she fell asleep. However, nowadays I work a full time warehouse job, 9:30-6, Monday to Saturday, and find myself utterly spent by the time I go to bed. I still try to chat and engage her so she can fall asleep, but I often find myself falling asleep mid convo first. This has been the cause of several arguments now.

While fighting to stay awake and strike conversation, she decided in annoyance that she didn't want to talk to me and told me to just go to sleep instead.

I'm just not sure if I'm being unreasonable here but I'm really upset and angry about this. I feel like I'm getting jerked around for falling asleep first when most nights I'm not trying to.

105,1cu6xq4,AITA For Not Allowing My Dad’s Plus One To My Wedding?,"
I (29F) am set to marry my boyfriend (32M) Cal in September. We’ve been together a little over five years and engaged for about nine months now. One of the first things we decided on for our wedding was that it would be relatively small. We planned for (including ourselves and the bride/groom party) a total of 100 people. It was a bit difficult to shave down our guest list to fit that, but we managed, and we will also be streaming the ceremony so that those who cannot attend will still be able to witness our union. 

A couple weeks ago, I thought Cal and I had everything figured out, deposits paid, dresses and tuxes picked out, decorations ordered etc etc. It may sound a bit early to have all my ducks in a row but I have always preferred being as prepared as possible as quickly as possible over last minute headaches. Anyway, I thought I had everything finalized or figured out, and then my dad (47M) called, asking if his girlfriend (45F) could come, because his invitation “didn’t allow for a plus one”. I didn’t even know my dad had a girlfriend. My mom passed late last year, and I had no idea my dad had even started dating again. I told him no, that there was no room, as the guest list had been finalized and explicitly stated there would be no allowance for additional guests or plus-ones.

Here’s where I might have been the asshole. Dad asked if his girlfriend could “use my mother’s seat”. And I got INCREDIBLY upset. “My mother’s seat” is an extra chair that will be decorated and left empty for my mother in her memory since she can’t be there on my special day. Pretty much everyone who is going to my wedding knows about this chair. I again, very firmly, told him no, and that his girlfriend is not invited, but she is welcome to watch the livestream. Dad told me I was being rude and ungrateful and that he’d call me back later, then hung up. He’s not always been the most agreeable person, but this was shocking to me.

He has continued to ask, I have continued to say no, and he isn’t slowing down. Am I being an asshole here?

109,1cu6f8m,AITA for defending my disabled friend?,"(group alt acct to respect privacy + tldr at the end)

I'm pissed af (in European and American) & may edit to clarify. Sorry for length, formatting, & English.

Preface / my friend ""B""(mid-30s) is like the parent of our  friends (aged 20-54, but mostly in the 30s). (I'm the pit bull, that'll come back later) There's ~9 in the group.

B has a mysterious illness & has been having mental and physical problems for the past few months. I noticed our neighborhood gatherings at B's house have been getting smaller, but when I asked B brushed it off.

Last night: card game @B's, like 6-7 ppl there (a lot of new people)... B's roomy and his new gf were supposed to stay in. I left about 10pm, with my fwb.

Woke up early ~5am to a text from B sent ~3:30am. B had woken up outside, by the card table, to no one there. with no memory of anything after about 8:30pm.

I went over ~6am to find B in a state. Loopy, banged up, and refusing an ambulance. B's vitals were fine, so I just cancelled my plans to keep an eye out.(my fwb was casually bitchy about it)

THIS IS WHERE I LOST IT: group chat was down, weird.. ok. Checking socials.....  they were ""privately"" accusing B of being a drama queen or some sort of junkie / cunt & verging on threatening to mess with B while having episodes. {{B is only on new scripts. Side effects: can't even have fruit, milk, or too much sunlight, let alone drugs!}}

I made a private post, tagging ALL of our group, even the ones that haven't been around. I didn't mention B's state in any way, but made it VERY CLEAR that I want nothing to do with anyone that's not supporting B.

I can't screencap it without doxxing... It was intense, but I didn't threaten anything. Been blocked by B's sibling & roommate #2, my cousin, and one of the neighbours. After a few salty msgs, oc. Most just saying ""I can't be around that"" like B ain't been (parental af) there for years?????

I feel like shit about losing long & great friendships over this. But  idk how these mfs be treating B like that. And idk if I actually scared them with the phrase ""we have a problem""??  Now I feel like I made a rift between the people that can and can't handle B having episodes. I understand some people panic in emergencies, but no one even called emergency.

I'm pissed af (in European and American) & may edit to clarify. Sorry for length, formatting, & English.

Preface / my friend ""B""(mid-30s) is like the parent of our  friends (aged 20-54, but mostly in the 30s). (I'm the pit bull, that'll come back later) There's ~9 in the group.

B has a mysterious illness & has been having mental and physical problems for the past few months. I noticed our neighborhood gatherings at B's house have been getting smaller, but when I asked B brushed it off.

Last night: card game @B's, like 6-7 ppl there (a lot of new people)... B's roomy and his new gf were supposed to stay in. I left about 10pm, with my fwb.

Woke up early ~5am to a text from B sent ~3:30am. B had woken up outside, by the card table, to no one there. with no memory of anything after about 8:30pm.

I went over ~6am to find B in a state. Loopy, banged up, and refusing an ambulance. B's vitals were fine, so I just cancelled my plans to keep an eye out.(my fwb was casually bitchy about it)

THIS IS WHERE I LOST IT: group chat was down, weird.. ok. Checking socials.....  they were ""privately"" accusing B of being a drama queen or some sort of junkie / cunt & verging on threatening to mess with B while having episodes. {{B is only on new scripts. Side effects: can't even have fruit, milk, or too much sunlight, let alone drugs!}}

110,1cu62rz,AITA for begging my (19f) boyfriend (19m) to not get any mouth piercings,"AITA for asking my boyfriend not to get the piercing? So recently my boyfriend was talking about wanting like 5 different mouth piercings. I told him I don’t think he should get any because they could destroy his teeth. I done my research because I also wanted some mouth piercings a while back but decided not to get them because of the damage they could cause. For some background information my boyfriend has a condition with his teeth where if something happens to them then they are extremely difficult to fix. He got a smiley piercing before we talked about this but he had to remove it because it was eroding his teeth and was making marks on them. Because of his previous history with the smiley causing damage that just furthers my argument that I don’t think he should have it because of his health. 
Every single day for the past couple weeks he’s been starting arguments with me over it. We would be having fun amazing days together but then he would bring it up, I tried not arguing and just staying calm but he just kept pushing and pushing until I had to argue back and it would completely ruin my mood. I tried asking him to stop bringing it up because it was hurting my feelings that all he wanted to do is argue about it but he just got mad at me. I begged him to just have a normal conversation with me about anything other than the piercing but he wouldn’t. I begged him to stop arguing with me. He keeps saying we are arguing because it’s my fault. I told him I was getting tired of the arguments every single day, he responded to this by calling me a child. When I asked how I was being childish he refused to give me an explanation. He told me I just need to get over my feelings being hurt by the argument. I told him I couldn’t just get over it because the things he said would hurt my feelings. He responded to that with “womp womp”.
I want the arguments to stop. He said the only way he would stop is if I let him get the mouth piercings. I want the arguments to stop but I don’t want him to have the piercings because of the damage they will do.

I informed her a few months ago that I will stop giving her an allowance when she turned 16. I did this because she is old enough to earn her own pocket money by getting a job or babysitting for anyone in the family. It is also good job experience for her to work and really understand getting a paycheck. Not to mention learning how to interact with coworkers.

Multiple family have younger children and are always asking for any relatives who can babysit. So there is something quite easy for her to do if she doesn't want to get a part time job

I did the same thing with my older son and he got his own job at the local pool. There are plenty of jobs around the area so that is not an issue. I made it clear I will help both of them to get a job, and when my son asked I helped him with his resume.

113,1cu5mup,AITA for refusing to tell my dad's other kids I won't be going on vacation with them?,"I'm (16m) being raised by my maternal grandparents. After my mom died my died dad decided he needed to get away and left me with them. We had all lived with my grandparents before that so it wasn't a huge change but I missed my dad. I was only 5 when it all went down. Three years later he came back and he was engaged and he wanted me to be a family with him and ""Sandy"". He and my grandparents fought in court over me because my grandparents were my legal guardians. Reunification therapy was ordered for the two of us and the courts let him see me for one weekend a month at the start. The reunification therapy didn't go the way it was meant to (with me wanting to live with him and feeling comfortable living with him again) and so it was decided my grandparents would keep custody of me and he would get every other weekend visitation. He was also allowed one week of vacation every summer until I turned 16 (so this will be the first summer it's not a legal obligation).

My dad and Sandy have kids together and my dad has tried to get me to want them. Not just Sandy or his other kids but him. He knows I don't want to be part of his family. He knows I see going to his house as a chore. And I know he tries but I'm not interested. I never hid that from him either. But my dad and Sandy took it for granted that I'd be going on vacation with them this year and it's not happening. Once I told them it was like this huge deal and my dad and Sandy freaked because they told their kids I'd be going and the last weekend I was there the kids were telling me they wanted us to go on this water slide together. Sandy told me I could go for the sake of the kids and I asked her why I'd do that. So then she was like, you should be the one to tell them since it'll make them sad. I told her they were the ones who assumed and didn't ask so I wasn't going to do their parenting for them. Dad asked me to reconsider. He told me he feels like he's losing me and these next two years will be big for our relationship in the future. I told him he lost me 11 years ago.

Sandy and dad are now both pissed off at me for not telling the kids myself. They told me I should grow up and take accountability and protect my innocent siblings.

Also to add why this is even an issue in the first place, My brother Jay(25M) and I are the ""black sheep"" of the family, mostly due to the fact we were born and mostly raised outside of marriage. The teasing and neglect only grew worse after our mother(44F) married Jerkfish(54M) and had our half siblings; (20F), (17M), (16M), and (11M).

Now, here's the dilemma. My half-sister who we will call Jojo(20F) is getting married to Rhitt(22M) in July. My mom and grandma asked that I make them a wedding cake, which I would've happily agreed to if I was invited to the wedding. The thing is, they wanted me to make a cake fit for 200 people, get a hotel near them (They hate that I'm not a Christian, so they think I'll bring evil into their house), work for 3 days, and get a flight there and back. I'd have to pay for all of it, they think it'd be a nice gift to my sister. I just laughed and sent them my price sheet, they. flipped. out. I was bombarded with texts from them about how selfish I am, how I am truly vile, how I am toxic for expecting my family to pay for my cake when they could just go to Walmart to get one, etc..

Jojo even messaged me on discord a week after I had sent the price sheet and asked why I would charge her when I made my best friend a free wedding cake. I simply told her to f off as not only was I invited to her wedding, but I was the MOH and in a way it was a ""returning the favor"" for being a genuinely good friend and helping me out when I was going through a lot.

Jay and his wife had said I'm not wrong for it and they'd do the same thing, and my boyfriend is on my side.

Update #1: I found out the exact reason for my brother's family and I not getting invited. Three months after my sister and her soon-to-be husband got engaged, my grandmother requested my sister not invite ""the sinners"". It was more along the lines of: ""If you don't invite your siblings you'll get a hefty portion of my will."". Don't really know what the proper term for that is, but I digress.  So, my sister is catering to the needs of my racist grandmother over her own sisters. I also found out another reason(out of the many) why my brother and I where black sheep in the family. So, you see. my mother is whiter than paper. My brother and i's biological father is Lakota/Sioux native American.  We were told he just left us ""because that's how the savages act."" when in reality, our dad died from a terminal raspatory illness that he had since he was a toddler. Some cyst type of deal? Not too sure. The hatred from them only grew further when my brother married a black woman and had my 3 nieces together. (Fourth on the way). I told jojo how hurt I was by picking money over family but I kinda expected it. She tried to offer me $50 to make the cake she wanted and I just declined. i shared this post with my brother and he is rolling while reading the comments.

I am very fat woman in my mid 30s, I love cooking and baking and I love to share. I often bring things to work for people to share.
Well I gain 20 kilos last 2 years and I decided I really need to take better care for myself. I found a doctor, nutritionist and trainer few weeks ago and now I am following the regime they set for me

I have gluten intolerance, lactose intolerance, egg/seafood/celery allergy so it's not exactly easy to cook for me, but I worked with nutritionist and she has made ""menu"" for me for every day of a month. With amount of food an everything (calories counted). I spend a lot of time cooking every day and I am bringing food to work with me in Tupperwares. The thing is that according to the doctor I ate really wrong - I was all the time dieting and I didn't eat enough necessary nutrients. So the nutritionist prescribed me big portions, especially when it comes to proteins, because she wants me to exchange fat for muscles. 

So to the issue - I brought  tupper of salad, some potatoes and meat with sauce to work. The meat was cutted in 4-5 pieces to fit into the tupper and when I warmed it up I sat and started to eat. My coworker came to me and asked if she could have one or two pieces of the meat and a bit of potatoes because it smelled heavenly and I always bring cooked stuff to the office. I told her no, that it's my lunch and I have set amount of calories intake, so I am sorry but no. She looked at me and told me I don't need this big portion and I should share with her, because it would help me. I told her sorry, but no and kept eating. She scoffed and left me alone, but since than she and her ""work BF"" keep making fun of me for eating like a pig. And that it s not very effective weight losing since I am still fatty 

So AITA?

The first thing to create in our app was the backend. Since I am more experienced with software engineering than Max, the plan was that I lead the development of the backend and Max helps.

Soon Max stopped working altogether, saying they're going through a bit of a rough patch and they'll get back to this project eventually. I said that's fine and also suggested that we try to find a 3rd person for this project. Max initially agreed, but later refused to take anybody on board, citing that they (Max) currently do not contribute enough to the project to justify owning a larger share than someone who would hop on now.

After Max resumed working, they quickly said that they do not like using Go (the backend programming language we use) and that I should just work on the backend on my own. Max had not used Go before this project. I thought that this was odd since the backend was the one thing we had to work on at the time.

Fast forward a few months, I have written most of the backend and most of the frontend too. Max has written the UI part of some frontend views, but not any frontend business logic. Max has not written any more backend code. I ask Max to write a small backend component, and they call me out saying that I demand too much of them in the backend. I find this yet again odd. At this time, Max started making backhanded compliments about my contributions, implying that the software is overengineered.

Currently in our codebase Max has written \~500 lines of code whereas I have written \~15 000 lines of code.

This week in a meeting with a potential recruit Max continued with the backhanded compliments and said that while I (the author of this post) am ready to quit my day job and work on this full time if it becomes financially feasible at some point, Max theirself is not willing to pause their PhD research for this.

The following day I sent Max a message saying that:

* I am done with the backhandled compliments
* If they are critical about the software design, they need to suggest changes and implement them
* I mentioned that I am unhappy about their lack of contribution to the software and their stated reason that they are unwilling and unable to learn a new programming language as a computer science PhD student and a tech startup co-founder
* I asked if they think it is fair that they own 50% of the company since they have refused to work on the project when I have needed their help, I have put multiple times the effort to this project in comparison to them, and they are not willing to work on this full time but I am

Max got upset and said they are taking a break from the company for now. AITA?

Me (13M) and my friend both got into a fight over something I did a week ago and it’s not settling right with me.

Me and this “friend” have had a mixed relationship over the past couple of months. There are just some things that he can’t learn to drop. He keeps on making jokes over about me being a girl because for some reason I don’t know if I had a hearing disability that day or not but I was essentially doing something in our tech class, and the teacher usually filters out by gender so it doesn’t cram together. I misheard her, and grabbed my computer when she said girls to go grab their computers. This joke started in February.

One week, we were doing a game of kickball with a little twist. 1, it was indoors, 2, if you step off of a base, you have to run. and 3, no bunts.

During this class game of kickball, our class split up in to 2 teams. Fast forward a little bit and there’s already bickering between both my “friend” and some arrogant kid on the other team. He bunts it and then they start bickering. This continues to re-occur for about the entire duration of our period. But towards the end, I’m both exhausted (mentally and physically) and attempting to make a stand that I’m not playing if they don’t stop bickering. He yells at me and makes some exaggerations. Somehow one pitch turns into 5 pitches. This very much adds up.

Fast forward to yesterday where for yesterday, about celebrating our time in PE class, each period got to go against the staff in a game of kickball. (This “friend” was not here for this.) We played, we lost. So be it right? Well no because last night this “friend” of mine comes says “did he sit down again?” And then we proceed to go back and fourth. (This argument is about the kickball game from last week.) I explain how I didn’t care about the rules and how they both threw the entire games rules out the window when they started bickering. He comes back calling me a dumbass, and how he’s competitive, so he’ll call them out on it when there doing so. I told him I agree, but the useless bickering about the other stuff pushed it.

It got intense, and I felt like I dragged it on and said some possibly offensive stuff by responding in retaliation from the jabs he was taking.

Recently he's been inviting me and my gf out a lot because he's having trouble with his gf and wants to vent a bit, which is fine

But every time he suggests we go out to eat, firstly trying to decide a time is always like getting blood from a stone, it's always ""I'll let you know later"" and then he'll text me an hour beforehand saying let's hang out at X time.

Not only that but we go to the place and he's easily around 15 mins late each time.

It's been getting frustrating and today he wanted to hang out for lunch, so after finally giving us a time that he was free, we started getting ready only for him to text me to change the time by an extra 20 minutes last minute.

We thought Screw it and just got ready extra slow since he's probably not going to be on time anyway.

Only for him to arrive ahead of schedule at the original time.
It was whatever, in my head, we've waited for him before so he can wait for us a bit this time.

When we arrived, approx 15 minutes late he had this ridiculously frustrated energy surrounding him and immediately called us out for being late, to which we couldn't help but laugh because we're 99% of the time we're waiting on him.
I couldn't believe his audacity to not only throw that kind of frustration at me but also at my gf in front of me.

I laughed it off whilst gently telling him he should stop and otherwise Lunch was fine after, talking and laughing.

He expressed he wanted to go out for some drinks later in the evening but had something planned with someone else first.
I agreed and we agreed a rough time and place.
Only for him to text me 30 minutes beforehand canceling without a reason.

Not the first time he has randomly cancelled or just nonchalantly texted me""hey let's do it another time instead""

I texted back and kinda blew up on him because I find the level he doesn't respect his friend's time really terrible. 
I told him I won't be making any more plans with him.

He ignored all these messages of course, no apology either.

It’s a complete mess. I’ve known them for the same amount of time, having met them during a group project a few years back. Our mutual friends have mostly chosen sides, but I decided to stay neutral. I told both A and B that I’m not taking sides because I believe their relationship issues are their responsibility.

B has been struggling with the breakup a lot, and it’s been hard to watch. She’s been getting more upset as time goes on and seems particularly angry that I haven’t taken her side. I’ve tried to be there for her, but I’ve also made it clear that I’m not going to get involved in their drama.

About a week ago, I met up with B to hang out, and she started venting about the breakup. I listened, but when she started bad-mouthing A, I told her I wasn’t going to react to that. She got really mad and said, “Being Switzerland doesn’t work.” I reiterated that I wasn’t going to get involved in their issues. She then got even more furious and started going off on me. And before storming off, she said “I hope you burn in eternal hell”.

I was really shocked and worried because this isn’t like her at all. She’s never been this hostile before. I decided to contact her mom, who I know pretty well. I explained that I was worried about B and that her behavior was erratic. I mentioned that I had tried talking to her, but she wasn’t listening to me. I didn’t bring up the “eternal hell” comment and kept it simple.

B found out that I talked to her mom and got even angrier. Now she blames me for her parents being on her case all the time. Some of our mutual friends also think I overstepped by getting her parents involved, saying she’s not a kid and it was wrong to go to them.

Now I’m questioning if I did the right thing. Everyone seems to think I was out of line, but I feel like no one is taking her “I hope you burn in eternal hell” comment seriously. I mean, who says that to a friend? Like really, you hope I end up burning in eternal hell?? It’s not even the regular “go to hell”. It felt really extreme and worrying to me.

124,1cu489a,AITA for refusing to meet my mum after my grandparents said me and my dad weren’t real family?,"
My parents had me really young (like 16) and my mum moved after I was born so my dad took care of me alone while still in school. I (14f) started meeting my mum (31f) last year when she came back all of a sudden and we meet every month. My dad (31m) doesn’t like my mum and wouldn’t talk to her if he could.

Recently my mum and I got into a fight because I didnt want to invite her to my birthday party because we aren’t close. So to smooth things over my grandparents proposed that we all have a family dinner together to celebrate separately. 

So my dad and I had dinner with them yesterday and it was a disaster. At first it was fine. But my dad was really uncomfortable and it was just awkward all round. 

Then my grandparents started talking about my mums involvement in my life. Like “maybe you and your mum can go somewhere together” that kind of thing. My mum suggested that she could send me to school in the mornings, which my dad does. And I could tell my dad was getting annoyed and he said its fine, and she didnt need to do that.

Then my grandparents started to get angry and asked why he was so against them, while my mum just looked embarrassed and didnt say anything. Then my grandma said “she needs her mother to have a REAL family, just her dad is not enough”. 

My dad got so mad that he just told me to pack up and we were going. And when we got home my dad just locked himself in his room and I could hear him crying. At that point I was just angry so today I called my mum and told her I didnt want to see her ever again. She started crying and tried to apologise but I hung up on her. She sent me voicemails saying that I shouldn’t punish her for what her parents said and that I need to stop overreacting

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"AITA for refusing to meet my mum after my grandparents said me and my dad weren’t real family? 
My parents had me really young (like 16) and my mum moved after I was born so my dad took care of me alone while still in school. I (14f) started meeting my mum (31f) last year when she came back all of a sudden and we meet every month. My dad (31m) doesn’t like my mum and wouldn’t talk to her if he could.

Recently my mum and I got into a fight because I didnt want to invite her to my birthday party because we aren’t close. So to smooth things over my grandparents proposed that we all have a family dinner together to celebrate separately. 

So my dad and I had dinner with them yesterday and it was a disaster. At first it was fine. But my dad was really uncomfortable and it was just awkward all round. 

Then my grandparents started talking about my mums involvement in my life. Like “maybe you and your mum can go somewhere together” that kind of thing. My mum suggested that she could send me to school in the mornings, which my dad does. And I could tell my dad was getting annoyed and he said its fine, and she didnt need to do that.

Then my grandparents started to get angry and asked why he was so against them, while my mum just looked embarrassed and didnt say anything. Then my grandma said “she needs her mother to have a REAL family, just her dad is not enough”. 

My dad got so mad that he just told me to pack up and we were going. And when we got home my dad just locked himself in his room and I could hear him crying. At that point I was just angry so today I called my mum and told her I didnt want to see her ever again. She started crying and tried to apologise but I hung up on her. She sent me voicemails saying that I shouldn’t punish her for what her parents said and that I need to stop overreacting

125,1cu3psg,AITA for wanting to leave my dog in the kitchen,"
Before I begin I'd like to state this is a throw away but with that said, now I can freely begin.
I 26(f) live with my mom, we have a great relationship overall but our dog who is seventeen no longer has control over his bowel movements and I often am the one cleaning up shit or pee either in the kitchen or the rugs in the living room. It gets exhausting and aggravating. 
It also doesn't help that often times when I do take him out, he doesn't want to do anything. This is where the AITA comes in, I told my mom to put the dog in the kitchen behind the baby gate and put him on his doggy mats she bought him so he doesn't wander the house pissing and shitting without control. She says it's ridiculous and completely unnecessary since I'll be home all day. It's not the nature if I'm home all day, it's the fact of keeping up with him plus I am lethargic myself and tend to sleep a lot.
I had the idea he'd be with his food and water, he'll have everything he would need and I won't have to stress taking him out every hour or so.

So does this make me the AITA for having this thought?  

Edit: I wanted to thank everyone's comments on the situation and wanting to know the situation better, it's not an ideal situation at all but this is me trying to bargain with what my mom wants for our dog. He's got not much of a life anymore but my mom wants to see things to the end, though I feel this isn't fair for our dog. I really love him but it's a lot watching him decline and cleaning up after him obviously. Overall what she does with him is up to her and I have no say but I can only make suggestions to maybe make things a bit easier. ",Asshole,2024-05-17,"AITA for wanting to leave my dog in the kitchen

Hi reddit, I(f) started to hang out with a guy classmate in 2022 ish not because he moved to our school in that year, but I just started hanging out with him. I didn't want to  hang out with him in the first grades because he was controlling and broke  my arm and then blamed it on another person. Fast-forward to this year, we got closer and hung out every day after school, and he developed a crush on me.... I didn't notice, my best friend (a girl) told me. On Valentine's Day, he got me flowers. One time, we were hanging out and asked me to be his best friend, I didn't really want to be best friends with him, but I accepted because I didn't want to be ""mean."" Fast-forward to two months ago, he started licking me ( licked his hand and putting it on me), it was very annoying and disgusting. And he gets mad at me for everything I don't do for him. One morning, I was discussing with my teacher about a drawing competition but it was very loud in the classroom and I was trying to understand what she was saying an he comes up to me and says good morning and I think I said ""off"" or ""okay"" in a annoyed kind of voice, and he got mad at me for this. Fast-forward to last Friday a friend of mine bringed a packet of cat stickers and gave to some  classmates and Jake (fake name for the guy friend) he wanted more stickers and asked her and she said no and that she will not give anymore stickers. He stole one sticker, and I saw him and told her that Jake stole a sticker. He looked at me with like hate. idk what to call it. After school ended, I went to the place we hung out, and he was there, but he didn't let me sit with him. I entered that spot and saw it was full and I didn't stay there and I started to go to a nearby store to buy something to eat. He went after me and said ""okay let's be friends again* I accepted because I didn't want him to beg me. 

What should I do to end this friendship, or should I end it

UPDATE 1
     I discovered that I am an asshole. I accept it, I don't have any problem with that. I shouldn't have lied about wanting to be best friends, I could've told the truth. I realized he was a bit weird, he makes me give him juicy bomb to eat. I didn't want to give him to eat it because it's a gloss not a snack. He was angry with me that I refused. I joked with him and he took it seriously, it wasn't even mean. And then he wanted to be friends again, I refused. He started to cry... I am not very proud of making him cry, i didn't apologize because when he stopped crying he  was sending mean messages to me on a group where our teacher  is in.

I should apologize but I don't know how. Bc I don't get in fights if you can call this that,  I only get with him.

I mentioned this to Alex and shared the document with him so he could read it and try to understand better what's going on in my mind. However, while he was reading what I had written, his mother entered the room and started reading what I was writing.

When Alex said that I had written the text, his mother talked to Alex's father, saying it was very wrong and that Alex shouldn't be reading that kind of thing.

He started saying that he should have stopped his mother from reading it and that the content bothered her and asked me to understand the whole situation. My parents don't mind this kind of thing, as it's fiction, but Alex's mother showed herself to be intolerant and prejudiced about it. There was nothing wrong with the document, just something with the Order Vera Cruz and Exorcist.

132,1cu2tqu,AITA for ruining family therapy?,"My (18 f) mom died when I was 7. My father aka step siblings dad remarried a year later. His new wife had 3 kids A (8 m) B (6 m) C (3 f). He said she wanted a dad for her kids and he wanted a mom for me. I remember telling himI didn't want a new mom. He said I would understand later.
My step siblings dad basically stopped doing anything alone with me. No more camping nights in the back yard or movie nights which we had done every week for years. Nothing. He spent time with all his new kids 'to bond'. Its been 11 years and he still doesn't have time for me bc hes 'bonding with them.' He stoped coming to my games when I got to HS.
His wife & I have nothing in common. I play three sports and I'm on the speech team. She's very girly and like girl trips to buy clothes and makeup at different malls. She knows I don't want to go but just tells my step siblings dad that she invited me. 
I have a teammate I play two sports with. Her parents have become like my own. She said she is totally fine with it. I've make sure all the time bc I don't want to take someone else's parents. But she's always the one to invite me over, brings her parents to my swim meets bc she knows no one will be there for me. Invitea me to go shopping for mother/father day gifts and says their from both of us. Her parents get me holiday gifts and say I'm always welcome. 
Senior night at basketball, I told her my step siblings dad isn't going to walk me around the floor bc he doesn't even come to games. She asked her dad to walk both of us and he was happy to. In a small town that made the paper bc they thought it was sweet. My step siblings dad flipped out & took us all to therapy. He asked why he hadn't been asked. I said bc he didn't come to games. He said he didn't know I played basketball anymore. I asked if that's why he didn't come to swim or softball when he couldn't miss A and B's practices. Or come to speech meets when he went to C's dance recitals. He just stared at me and said he didn't know I still did those either. I asked why he talked for days about B's camping trip but didn't ask about my senior trip to Mexico. He said he didn't know I went. I said he signed the form. He admitted he didn't read it. I asked if he remembered the last time I called him dad. He said he didn't know I stopped. I said May 13 2021. He said that was the day A B C started. I said I know. You stopped being my dad when you started being theirs.

My father aka step siblings dad remarried a year later. His new wife had 3 kids A (8 m) B (6 m) C (3 f). He said she wanted a dad for her kids and he wanted a mom for me. I remember telling himI didn't want a new mom. He said I would understand later.
My step siblings dad basically stopped doing anything alone with me. No more camping nights in the back yard or movie nights which we had done every week for years. Nothing. He spent time with all his new kids 'to bond'. Its been 11 years and he still doesn't have time for me bc hes 'bonding with them.' He stoped coming to my games when I got to HS.
His wife & I have nothing in common. I play three sports and I'm on the speech team. She's very girly and like girl trips to buy clothes and makeup at different malls. She knows I don't want to go but just tells my step siblings dad that she invited me. 
I have a teammate I play two sports with. Her parents have become like my own. She said she is totally fine with it. I've make sure all the time bc I don't want to take someone else's parents. But she's always the one to invite me over, brings her parents to my swim meets bc she knows no one will be there for me. Invitea me to go shopping for mother/father day gifts and says their from both of us. Her parents get me holiday gifts and say I'm always welcome. 
Senior night at basketball, I told her my step siblings dad isn't going to walk me around the floor bc he doesn't even come to games. She asked her dad to walk both of us and he was happy to. In a small town that made the paper bc they thought it was sweet. My step siblings dad flipped out & took us all to therapy. He asked why he hadn't been asked. I said bc he didn't come to games. He said he didn't know I played basketball anymore. I asked if that's why he didn't come to swim or softball when he couldn't miss A and B's practices. Or come to speech meets when he went to C's dance recitals. He just stared at me and said he didn't know I still did those either. I asked why he talked for days about B's camping trip but didn't ask about my senior trip to Mexico. He said he didn't know I went. I said he signed the form. He admitted he didn't read it. I asked if he remembered the last time I called him dad. He said he didn't know I stopped. I said May 13 2021. He said that was the day A B C started. I said I know. You stopped being my dad when you started being theirs.

Now they DM'd me again begging me to join them for the final semester project and I already had arrangements to work with the group I have worked on with in other projects. I honestly felt bad for rejecting them a few times before and they even said shit like: 
""You act like you're too big for us""
""You never work with us""

134,1cu28da,AITA for making my roommate feel bad about her laziness considering university?,"Me (24) and my roommate of two years (24) study the same thing at university. Thats how we met. We both struggle with a few private things (money, mental health) which made our academic progress hard. We started in the same year, and when we met, we where at a similar progress state(?). 

Now, I am almost finished with my degree while she is still behind.

I tried to help her with giving advice on courses or study techniques which helped me focus. She never really took those advices and did it her own way. I stopped giving those.

Once that happened, I stopped talking about university with her overall, not wanting to rub it under her nose that we are not at the same pace. 

However I noticed something. She has a friend, who tries to get into university, who hasn't been in school for a few years and really struggles. She complained a bunch about her friend, even gossiped in really harsh tones how stupid she thinks she is, for thinking she can do it. I thought she probably did that to make herself feel better for not putting work into her own degree. There are similarities in the behavior her friend has and her, yet keep in mind her friend hasn't been in school for years and is used to working:

* She doesn't really study, neither plans anything nor has an overview of the degree
* she blames her not being able to study on external factors
* she self diagnosed herself with ADHD even though she is in therapy for over 3 years and could ask a professional
* she goes on multiple vacations during exam phases

A few things happened where I caught myself accidentally pointing the finger at her in a rather insensitive way:

* She talked about wanting to do an exchange year in her masters, I reacted with ""You gotta finish bachelor first before thinking about that.""
* She asked me how I got a good grade on a really difficult exam where she did study yet not enough so she had to cheat. I reacted with ""Well...I studied."" She replied with ""Yea but I studied too."" 
* I asked her why she is going on so many vacations during exam phase and said something along the lines of ""You're doing the same as your friend, who you complain about non stop.""

So, am I the asshole for letting those bottled up feelings get out in a rude way?

TL;DR: My roommate and me study the same subject and started off the same time. She's lazy in my eyes,  not putting in the effort, therefore further behind than me.

135,1cu206w,AITA for not allowing alcohol at the party we were planning to throw for my brother and his fiance after their wedding ceremony?,"*Burner account*

My (32F) brother's fiance, Chelsea (32 also), does not fit in well with our family. She's very loud and has never had a full-time job. Both my parents are in their mid-60s and continue to work full-time, with no ability to retire. I know her family has struggled even more financially. My parents have always been very kind to Chelsea, though blow-ups have happened with my Dad related to her chronic cannabis use and financial decision making 

She and my brother announced their engagement around 2-3 years ago. This led to some intense planning and spending, despite their lack of money. Shortly after, they announce she is pregnant. They end up cancelling the reception, but only after losing the deposit. The baby has since been born.

Because we want people to have somewhere to go after their ceremony, my Dad offers to host a barbecue for them. Chelsea is initially hesitant, but eventually gets on board and creates a Facebook group with everyone she wants invited (including our extended family). She insists we not refer to the event as the ""reception"" because she still believes they will have the reception they intended at some point. She makes it clear in the group that we are planning the event. My parents and I get together and clarify roles. The budget is coming out at a couple thousand when you include food, chair rentals, etc. I make a website where people can RSVP.

I post the RSVP link to the Facebook group. Very shortly after, she starts peppering me with questions about food, etc. She seems pleased with my responses.

Then she asks, ""is it gonna be a BOYB kinda thing or if were gonna be providing the alcohol?""

It's 7:00 in the morning. I inform her that we aren't providing alcohol and that my Dad prefers to not have alcohol because of liability concerns. 

She absolutely explodes and sends me a slew of messages. Here are the highlights:
- a dry ""reception"" is stupid
- no one will come if the event is dry
- if people can't drink they will smoke tonnes of cannabis
- my family is judgemental
- it's not what she had envisioned for her day (""MY day"")

I weather the comments, telling her to talk it over with my brother and bring up her concerns with my Dad. 

She then says that if there is no alcohol there is no barbecue. She proceeds to delete my RSVP request off the Facebook group, and adds a post that says the event is cancelled ""on account of no alcohol."" This is mortifying to me - 20 people had already RSVP'd.

I'm livid, to the point that it affected me at work all week. I think she's ungrateful and entitled, and she has behaved atrociously towards the family she is joining. I sent her an angry message saying that she had disrepected my parents and that she had thrown my work in my face. To which she responded, ""Nothings getting thrown in your face, it's cancelled unless we can make alcohol happen. Not a big deal.""

She continues to insist that my parents and I are in the wrong.

AITA?

Edit to update: Thanks everyone for your feedback! I would reply to them all if I could. I'm getting the sense from the balance of comments that this is a true ESH. It's been helpful to hear from the YTA camp to reflect on my own role in the situation. In retrospect, hosting the event (for me) was definitely about pleasing extended family and not about the couple, which is wrong. In my defense, I did throw her a nice baby shower with my Mom and take her wedding dress shopping, so I was trying to be genuinely helpful at points. My Dad says he told them no alcohol but obviously she didn't understand (or he could be revising history). I'm one of her bridesmaids and I'm starting to think I shouldn't be after realizing how deep my resentment and judgment toward her go. Feel free to weigh in on how to handle that (lol). 

Update to update: Lol well things have definitely skewed asshole since then! Just wanted to add for the folks who are being sweet and making suggestions to solve the issues, there's no need because the BBQ is off, as per the bride's request. We're definitely not going to push the issue. We have no plans to host anything after the ceremony because it could get awkward about who to include (more people were invited to the ceremony than the event following). I'm still working up the motivation to apologize to her, but getting outweighed by the majority has definitely made it easier.

My sister (15f) was born with chronic health problems and a physical disability. Her life hasn't been easy and she's pretty often in pain and limited in what she can and can't do. It meant our parents were always making special time for her and doing what they could to let her enjoy being a kid. It also meant my parents weren't really my parents. They would take her places and leave me behind at home or with someone else in the family. I never got that same time with them. They even missed two of my birthdays completely because they had focused so much on bringing my sister to concerts she wanted to go to that they forgot my birthday and didn't even get me something small like a $5 gift card which they did a few times when their money was more focused on my sister.

I spent most of my time with my paternal grandparents when I was younger. But grandma died 3 years ago and grandpa lives in a nursing home in another city so I don't have them anymore and that made it more difficult.

138,1cu0uy9,WIBTA for bringing up my girlfriend`s weight gain ?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old guy, and I’ve been dating my 20-year-old girlfriend for about 4 months now. I know it’s still early in our relationship, but we’ve really bonded and things have been going great overall. However, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.

Here’s the situation: I have a very busy work schedule, and I rarely have time to cook at home. As a result, I eat almost all my meals at restaurants or fast food places. It’s not the healthiest choice, but I work out regularly and manage to stay in good shape. This lifestyle has been my norm for the past year or so.

My girlfriend, on the other hand, used to rarely eat out before we started dating. She has more breaks and time to cook, and she used to make her own meals. Since we’ve been together, she’s stopped cooking and waits for me to come get her so we can eat out. Initially, this wasn’t an issue, but she’s gained a lot of weight recently – around 20kg (44lbs) in the past three months. She was fit before, and this rapid weight gain has me worried about her health.

We used to go on hikes together without any problems, but on our last hike a week ago, she really struggled to keep up, and we had to cut it short. I’ve tried suggesting that we work out together, but she’s not interested and says she doesn’t like sports. I’ve also mentioned that she could cook at home while waiting for me, and we could eat together there – it’s healthier and cheaper – but she prefers eating out.

I’m in a bit of a bind. I don’t like the weight she’s gained from a physical attraction standpoint, but more importantly, I’m concerned about her health. I’m unsure how to bring this up without hurting her feelings or making her feel bad. I also feel somewhat responsible since my eating habits have influenced her.

WIBTA for bringing her weight gain up ?

Edit : ""Am aware that my life style is not healthy that\`s why I do work out and get supplements and stuff to try and balance it and stay fit. My gf did notice the weight gain and she recently asked me to disconnect from our scale cause she does not feel comfortable with me knowing her weight (I have a smart weight scale that we use and it tracs your weight gains and loses) I did disconnect from it respecting her privacy but the last time I checked when I had access to it she gained 20kg, and its also very noticeable with her old and new pictures.

I am aware that it\`s normal for people to gain weight when comfortable and in a healthy rs but the weight she gained in the span of 3 months is really concerning and it\`s also impacting our hikes, walks and stuff we do in general.

I wanna clarify that we do cook in the weekends and we do help each other in the kitchen, and I do like cooking and helping out. But in week days I do not have time to cook at home or prepare my food before and also I don\`t wanna eat by myself, I much prefer spending time together.

she\`s very aware of her weight gain but I feel like since i told her nothing about it she\`s not motivated to change it""

Edit 2: :'' I am well aware that my life style is not healthy and I should change it. I would much prefer eating at home and/or eat healthy. Weight gain or loss does not equal to being healthy. I keep an eye on what I eat and regularly check with my doctor. Which my girlfriend lacks and is not whiling to do.

My lifestyle and work does not allow me to choose, in the end of the day the only choice I have is fast-food/restaurant. I am trying to change that and look for healthy alternatives especially now with my girlfriend.

And I would also like to address that I don\`t think the country where I am from plays a role on this (a lot of the comment talking about the US life style). I am from France and most of places here are healthier. But still, doesn\`t mean you shouldn\`t regulate what you eat or burn the access fat/calories you take in.

I’m a 23-year-old guy, and I’ve been dating my 20-year-old girlfriend for about 4 months now. I know it’s still early in our relationship, but we’ve really bonded and things have been going great overall. However, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.

Here’s the situation: I have a very busy work schedule, and I rarely have time to cook at home. As a result, I eat almost all my meals at restaurants or fast food places. It’s not the healthiest choice, but I work out regularly and manage to stay in good shape. This lifestyle has been my norm for the past year or so.

My girlfriend, on the other hand, used to rarely eat out before we started dating. She has more breaks and time to cook, and she used to make her own meals. Since we’ve been together, she’s stopped cooking and waits for me to come get her so we can eat out. Initially, this wasn’t an issue, but she’s gained a lot of weight recently – around 20kg (44lbs) in the past three months.

139,1cu0fyb,AITA for stressing out a friend before their test?,"I was texting my friend last night and the converseation turned sour. For context, she has a pretty important test this morning. We were chatting, I was talking about how I listen to music before exams and she said she liked to cram

She said she was doing some active recall whilst watching Netflix, and I asked ""Why the Netflix?"". She said she liked it as background noise and didn't want to work, so I said it would be better to focus just on working or relaxing. She said that I listen to music while revising, and I said that me doing something wrong doesn't mean she isn't doing something wrong.

Her ""How am I doing something wrong? Isn't wrong your own opinion?""

Me ""yeah?""

Her ""Should you really talk about right or wrong?""

Me ""That's not the question at hand though.""

Her ""It is though, ur question only directs to one answer because its based upon opinion.""

Me ""Uh huh. Then that's my opinion.""

Her ""Good for you, thank you so much for expressing your opinion.""

Me ""Cool.""

An hour passes. Then, she says how she appreciates my advice but it made her feel sad and she still feels miserable despite an hour passing, and she wished I hadn't said it. So I said ""Yeah, that's fair, sorry for saying it. Hope you feel better, I didn't mean to make you feel bad when I said it.""

Then she goes on to say how she's ended up crying because I didn't want to address the fact that she wasn't happy with something that I didn't think was a big deal.

I said I didn't realise she was so upset by it, and it was my mistake for not mentioning it earlier.

She says she's not that bothered by the phrase, but instead by the fact that I won't get why she's upset, so I won't feel sorry .

I said that my other friends have different emotional tolerances to her so i'm not that quick at catching whats going.

She says that me saying the phrase is like pushing someone over before a marathon and that even if nothing happens, you shouldn't just go ""oops"" and leave. How it didn't matter if I thought she was just a bit annoyed or very annoyed, I should've apologised either way.

After this, I say ""sure, thats fair enough.""

She says ""I don't think you get it, you're still too stubborn and i'm still too sensitive but what does it matter."" She sends a long text talking about she's ""clinically mentally off"" and how my comment kicked off a terrible migraine and she's very upset and that I should've genuinely apologised when I realised I was wrong. She says that when I apologise, I should do it without setting boundaries like ""I'll apologise for this even though I didn't do this or I that, or my other friends react differently to you"".

I thanked her for explaining and told her good luck, but I'd like another pair of eyes on this. I never wanted her to feel bad, and I am sorry for hurting her feelings, but I feel like there wasn't much else I could've done.

She asked what about our holiday next year. I said we'd still be able to go on one but it would either be a bit later/earlier than usual and would probably be slightly shorter.

I mentioned that she's welcome to join me on the cruise but she refused. She said it's not fair that our holiday has to suffer just so I can go away. I pointed out it's a one off to celebrate my achievement and that it's not going to be a regular thing.

141,1ctzlbr,AITA for calling my (f20) mom (F50) a manipulate asshole,"For context I've always had problems with my mom. I think the best way to describe her would be controlling. She would yell, curse and generally be very explosive, it was hard to know what would “trigger” her.
All of this led to me moving out to my bf/his family's house as soon as I turned 18. I cut off all contact with my parents for a few days to calm down and then went in contact with my dad. Long story short we talked it through and established a more healthy relationship. I thought my mom was a bit different too, just nicer overall, and that having distance to her truly helped a lot.

I now work as a substitute teacher, sometimes monday-friday and sometimes only every other day. I visit my parents every now and then but because of work, lack of money and lack of public transportation where I live, I can't visit too often or stay for many days at a time. So I compensate by texting my parents and sending them pictures. 
This month my mom has not been very responsive to my messages. I didn't think much of it because she does have a bunch of health problems and even had a stroke a few months back, so I assumed that she was just tired. With that in mind I wished her happy Mother's Day twice this week and went to visit last Monday with a mother's day gift (20 dollar chocolate box). She seemed happy about it.
The next morning I said that I would have to head home in the evening because I had work the next day. I think this is what set her off. She told me “well you don't care about us anyway. I decided to test you this month by ignoring your messages to see if you would care. But you only seem to care when you need something”. This was insane for me to hear. Looking back at our messages this month and there was only “how's it going “ messages from me, a few pictures I sent from work and some volunteer work I do, the happy mother's Days messages and one message where I briefly mentioned that I needed to be careful with money and save up because me and my bf are moving out soon. In that moment I realized how utterly stupid and manipulative her words and behavior was. 
She then proceeded to say that I never visit. I explained that I've been working and visiting on my free days and even took this day off to celebrate Mother's Day. It just became a yelling argument, I tried keeping my cool but was getting really worked up and emotional.
I ended up saying “wtf do you want from me? Do you realize how manipulative you are? you're such an asshole”. I went outside crying to cool down. When I went back in to gather my things, my dad was “scolding” my mom for always making me cry when I visited. It made me think back and realize that this was true and that I in fact had often ended up crying or arguing with my mom over something she initiated. I just left and texted my dad later to apologize for all the yelling and thank him for standing up for me.

144,1ctytje,AITA for expecting to have driving help when I was younger?,"  So basically, I was in University for 2 years. I got an associates and ended up dropping out due to depression, burnout, and lack of financial resources. I had saved up all my money for use in a surgery that my insurance was refusing to cover. I was working the best paying jobs for my lack of skills, with no car. This was a batista for around 18/hr and an overnight stocker at for 17/hr. Both jobs were 3 hours away on a bus (20 minutes drive under any other circumstances). I had to sleep at my Starbucks job because the busses did not operate at the time I got off. 

  Before I started working these jobs and the health situation and all that, I had enough money to downpay a car. With all things considered, I now think moving w/ no car is impossible in most of Florida. 18-20 at the time of moving out, but no license or driving experience. 

  This fatigue I was experiencing from having to travel so many hours for basic resources (medicine, my job, and an affordable supermarket) with the poor results of my surgery really combined into a nasty mix and I didn't feel like I could do it anymore. I was risking my physical health and compromising my classes for work and to afford things such as textbooks and rent. And due to my financial aid situation, I needed to take a lot of classes every semester to qualify. And I would lose student housing if the semester was taken off. 

  My family home is on a highway. No one I've ever met would have been willing to let me or any of their friends practice driving their car, under any circumstances. When I was 16-18, everything was shut down due to covid. I was taking driver's Ed and the day I was going to get my license, school shut down. Driving schools shut down as well. One even took money and never refunded it. I spent my last 2 years of high school in lockdown, mostly by myself, because my brother had moved out and I was terrified of getting people sick.. 

This left the only people I had to supplement this resource being parents. So I had regularly asked them around this age, and the answer was no. It was their only car and they didn't want me to touch it. 

  The incongruence is that my brother was allowed to when he was 16. To the point they ended up giving him a car. My brother drove on highways when he was 16 with their car vs. Me just wanting to practice on empty parking lots when i was 18, and no one was on the road for miles during lockdown. When I asked them about it, in this way, they were pretty offended about it and said I should have just gotten the license and training on my own. Even when I tell them why that was impossible at the time. Whenever I ask questions like this, they go on a rant to my brother about how I'm selfish and expect them to let me have access to these things. And my brother agrees by saying it's their car edit: drivers Ed is not drivers school. I took drivers Ed at 16
  
",Not the A-hole,2024-05-17,"AITA for expecting to have driving help when I was younger?   So basically, I was in University for 2 years. I got an associates and ended up dropping out due to depression, burnout, and lack of financial resources. I had saved up all my money for use in a surgery that my insurance was refusing to cover. I was working the best paying jobs for my lack of skills, with no car. This was a batista for around 18/hr and an overnight stocker at for 17/hr. Both jobs were 3 hours away on a bus (20 minutes drive under any other circumstances). I had to sleep at my Starbucks job because the busses did not operate at the time I got off. 

  Before I started working these jobs and the health situation and all that, I had enough money to downpay a car. With all things considered, I now think moving w/ no car is impossible in most of Florida. 18-20 at the time of moving out, but no license or driving experience. 

  This fatigue I was experiencing from having to travel so many hours for basic resources (medicine, my job, and an affordable supermarket) with the poor results of my surgery really combined into a nasty mix and I didn't feel like I could do it anymore. I was risking my physical health and compromising my classes for work and to afford things such as textbooks and rent. And due to my financial aid situation, I needed to take a lot of classes every semester to qualify. And I would lose student housing if the semester was taken off. 

  My family home is on a highway. No one I've ever met would have been willing to let me or any of their friends practice driving their car, under any circumstances. When I was 16-18, everything was shut down due to covid. I was taking driver's Ed and the day I was going to get my license, school shut down. Driving schools shut down as well.

My mom proceeds to LECTURE ME on how I shouldn't have made her wait. It took ""ages"" and asking why I took so long. I called her childish and bratty for how she was acting over having to wait SECONDS for her kid to get in the car. 

We were yelling the whole way home and she stomped YES STOMPED up to her room and slammed the door while yelling down from her room.

Quick backstory if you didn't get a chance to read my last post. I am a female in my mid 30s, I have 2 older brothers, and 1 younger sister. My mom favors my younger sister. For my birthday back in March, my mom decided that she needed to take me and my little sister out to lunch to celebrate, but plans got changed and they decided to take me out between their nail appointment (that I wasn't invited to) and the easter egg hunt. After having my feelings hurt so many times by being put on the back burner by my mom, I decided that I was done trying.

Two weeks after letting my mom know how badly she hurt me, she had my little sister call me to try to get me to forgive and forget everything that had happened. My sister invited me to go shopping with her and mom after they got done with their nail appointment. I told my sister that I didn't want anything to do with our mom. After arguing with my sister for a bit, she realized where I was coming from and talked to my mom for me. My mom listened to my sister, who then convinced my mom to call me and apologize.

I want a relationship with my mom, I do love her a lot, but I don't like being hurt by her all the time., so I told her exactly how I was feeling, and what I needed her to do so I no longer feel like this. I said that I needed to be invited out more often, and I needed to spend time with her alone. She is always with my sister alone, and I think it's only fair that she does that every once in a while, with me. I thought she heard me, so I forgave her.

On her 18th birthday party which was 2 weeks after this, one of her friends kept giving ugly looks to my brother (21M) and his boyfriend (28M), I am not a person to stand there and not do anything (my brother is very shy and awkward) so obviously I brought this up to my cousin and I asked her what her friends problem was? She brushed it off, and went about her day. Now forward two months later, I had recently made a comment about her same friend from the party, she sided with her and didn’t think anything bad of those dirty looks her friend gave my brother. 

I assume those dirty looks were because my brother and his boyfriend were acting like a couple, which they are!! Obviously! Her friend didn’t like it I’m assuming, since we’re from a pretty conservative town and plus we live in TX.

I’m 25 y/o and I haven’t really gotten anywhere career-wise. My parents have supported me my entire life. They sent me to good schools.

I’ve held jobs before, but for no longer than a year. My parents often have a hand in it. I’ve tried jobs in different industries and I do enjoy them at first but get bored eventually, which isn’t to say I do a lousy job. In fact, I tend to leave a good impression with my employers. For most of my life, I’ve always felt strongly about food (cooking, baking, eating), but my mom insists I take an office job or at least something she considers white collar. She wants me to go back to school to study to become a dentist. That’s 6 years back in school, and I just don’t see myself doing that or enjoying it. 

For a time, I found myself excited at the prospect of going back to school and studying to be a doctor or a lawyer or something else, but it’s fleeting. What’s remained constant is my passion for food. So I’m just torn if I should give going back to school a shot and and find out if it is for me, or if I should take the offer to work somewhere doing something I love and not get paid as much?

158,1ctwc4c,AITA for keeping a secret from my best friend and loosing the friendship because of it,"Last year I (F25, autistic) wanted to nominate my friend (F26)for an award but I needed her mother’s help to reach out to some contacts. Her mother told me that she didn’t think her daughter was worthy of the award and refused to help me. I was unable to nominate my friend. I swore I’d never ever tell my friend about what her mom said, ever.  

Two months ago my friend cancelled some weekend plans with me because her mom was mad she was going to so many things with me and I replied with a text message saying  “I have nothing charitable to say about this so I’ll just step back from this convo.” And my friend got really weird and stopped texting me back until a few days later. 

Now we were really close - like call each other randomly throughout the day just to say hi and we’ve travelled together, and a whole bunch of other stuff. After this though she started to get really flaky and I told her “hey sorry I realize now my message seemed harsh but it wasn’t about you!” And a few weeks later I had surgery. I told my friend before surgery that I wasn’t taking my phone into hospital but would catch up with her afterwards. 

Everything just seemed weird and she stopped replying like normal after this. She never came to visit me after surgery, and even when we did plan something, she said she was really busy and would “find some time I guess” to drop by so I told her it’s okay she can go be with her family. I had a really bad meltdown that night because I was so lonely and sad. 

Now she keeps saying all I’ve been is upset with her, but I’ve texted her so many times telling her I’m not upset. 

I asked her over text if we could hang out or something and I said I really missed her, but she just replied with a message that said “we should talk in person” which led me to spiral into another meltdown because the last person she said that to was her boyfriend who she broke up with and she’s never sent me such an impersonal message before. 

She thinks I’m upset with her, but I’ve never been upset with her, only her mom.

She is argumentative and she talks down to me ALOT. We recently bought a car for her to use and told her that she needs to pay for half of the monthly payment - $135 her part. Now that she wants to move in with BF, she is complaining about paying for any of it. 

Tonight, I overheard her loudly talking to her boyfriend. He has paid nothing towards his part of the trip (I've already bought his plane ticket) and was saying he didn't know if he wanted to go because he doesn't want to be around me and my husband.
