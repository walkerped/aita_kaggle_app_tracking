0,1cunkq9,AITA for asking my bf to cook rice?,"I (32F) was heading home after work today, so I called my bf (35M). We were having salmon and I wanted rice. Let’s call him Steve. Steve works from home. I asked Steve if he would start making the rice before I got home. My commute is 30 minutes and his dad was coming over at 6. I had left at 5 and the rice in question takes 45 minutes to make. Steve recalled an incident where he tried to make rice and it was undercooked, because he didn’t know how to make it. I told him what to do previously and told him to at least start boiling the water, so that would save me some time and it would be done by the time I got home. He told me no. I got a bit upset, because I wanted rice with my meal. He explained to me on the phone all the reasons why he cannot make rice and I will have to make it myself. I hung up on him.


When I got home, he ignored me. Silent treatment. His dad showed up. 
I proceeded to start making a frozen dumpling alternative, and went downstairs briefly to defuse. After our meal, my bf told me I should not expect him to make rice because he “cannot do it.” He told me “if I wanted rice, I should have made it myself,” and explained that I am manipulative for asking him to make that, or even start that. We got in a heated argument about the rice, in which I called him “lazy,” because he cannot do a simple task. He called me a bitch, and stormed off to play video games the rest of the night. I texted him to tell him how simple my request was, and I don’t appreciate being called a bitch. He sent me “the Narcissist’s prayer”.

2,1cunf2e,AITA for leaving my friend’s sleepover because she was on the phone with her boyfriend the whole time?,"Last weekend, I(18f) went to a sleepover at my friend’s(18f) house. She invited me to it around a week prior saying that we “needed to catch up with each other” since we haven’t went to the same school in around 4 years. I agreed with her and told her that I would come, solely because I missed her a lot and at one point in my life she was my best friend, but after middle school ended and we went our separate ways. We grew apart and slowly stopped reaching out to each other and only started back talking just a couple months ago.

When I first arrived to her house for the sleepover, she was already on the phone with her boyfriend(19m) and barely even noticed me walk into her house(the door was open because when I texted her that I was on the way, she told me that the door would be unlocked for me and I could just walk right inside.) I was trying to get her attention and when I finaly did, all she did was give me a wave and continued to to talk with her boyfriend on the phone. 

I found it pretty weird that she didn’t give me an actual greeting but I just shrugged it off because I thought that she would get off of the phone with him soon. She pointed me to the direction of her room so I could drop my stuff off, so I did just that. When I came back to the living room and tried to start conversation with her, she would just shut me down and continue to talk with him.

After a couple of hours of her barely even talking to me just to talk with him, I grabbed my bags and left without saying a word to her. She texted me around a hour afterwards asking me why I left and I responded to her saying that I left because I didn’t want to have a sleepover with someone who was just on the phone with their partner the whole entire time. I also told her that the whole sleepover was just a disappointment and for her to never invite me to one again. 

She took offense to this and told all of our mutual friends about it with some of them blocking me and calling me “self entitled”, and even had her boyfriend text me saying that i’m messed up and need to apologize, while my family thinks im not in the wrong at all and did the right thing.

But I honestly don’t know, so AITA?

3,1cun9z2,AITA for not paying my aunt,"My mom was in very bad health the last 3 years after getting covid. She was renting a house with my brother until they both got covid. I found them when they were not responding to my calls. My brother passed in his sleep and my mom was barely hanging on requiring a month in the icu. My mom moved back home but didn’t want to stay due to my bro passing there. At the time my aunt was trying to sell a manufactured home she no longer wanted bc her husband passed and didn’t want to visit Florida in the winter. She ended up giving it to mom and was signed over without stipulation/lien. My aunt paid about $20k for it several years prior and it was worth even less at the time it was gifted because the economy was in the tank. Not to mention my aunt was paying $700/month for lot rent, electric, upkeep and monthly insurance payments. My mom lived there nearly 3 years but sadly passed away 3 months ago d/t covid complications. During that time my mom paid the lot rent, did repairs after the hurricane and paid over $ 350 a month for insurance. 

Prior to my mom’s passing I haven’t heard from my aunt in over 15 years.  I called her to let her know she passed and that was it. Not any real empathy which doesn’t matter. She ended up calling me on mom’s bday last month and went into that mom agreed that the manufactured home would be sold after she passed and my aunt would be given ALL the proceeds. Of course the value is a little more now due to the strong housing market. However, I never heard of this arrangement and there was no will stating this. My mom mentioned to me before she passed about selling it and using the proceeds for an ALF since her health continued to decline. 

Currently I am going through the probate process which has turned out to be rather complicated and expensive. On top of being very time consuming. My mom also has a ton of medical and credit card debt. To be honest, I would be very lucky to break even especially since I am now paying the lot rent, listing fee, electric, landscaping and insurance for the home. 

While I appreciate my aunt gifting my mom the manufactured home, I feel it was also self serving bc she had problems selling it and didn’t want to pay the lot fee, upkeep and insurance. Plus she hasn’t offered to help with the lot fee or insurance payments or listing fee knowing that I am currently paying it. However, I am usually the type of person that tries to make everything right, to owe no one and not make enemies. However, I personally don’t feel like I owe her anything much less ALL the proceeds from a potential sale when I have other debts to resolve. Maybe, if all goes better than anticipated I could send her a portion of the proceeds, but it’s not looking like that will happen.

i 25 have a younger brother 21

growing up we got along really well, but about 3 years ago he rubbed me the wrong way and without details, i chose to go no contact until about 4 months ago. 

Now, he has two brand new children and a fiancé who chooses not to work. 

1 week after we reconnected, he asked me for a few dollars for gas. i said yes. 

the following weeks that amount slowly grew for pampers plus food for his kids and fiance. & even to hang out with a friend (?) 

still here 4 months later, & i’ve noticed that most of the time we have a conversation, 7/10 he asks for something (not much, but 1000 cuts). outside of that we don’t talk too often. BUT in his defense these are loans he asks for, he pays me back. 


i make enough money to support myself and help him this way. but honestly, i don’t want to.  

especially considering that his goal is to be a man who’s wife doesn’t NEED to work if she doesn’t want to. so she doesn’t. 

(e.g., it’s literally my birthday, he knows i just spent a lot of money for it, but he texts me to ask for $$ for him his two kids and fiance to eat. sends a pic as he’s in the drive thru. and then calls me bc i didn’t answer right away)

i want to be a good brother/uncle, and don’t want to seem selfish. just on my own terms, and once we have a more solid relationship post no-contact. 

not because he put himself in a bind.

at the end, i care for my brother as most people should. and he is putting the work in by keeping a job. but as it would be for most 21 year olds, its rough supporting 4 people on your own. 

so it makes me wonder

AITA?

also worth noting that when we were kids i would always buy us food/fun/pay for him without hesitation. but he was 11 not 21

5,1cun1h9,AITA? Kicking my friend out of my Apartment.,"So about 10 months ago, I decided to let my best friend move into my Apartment. To keep it short, he was in a crappy living situation and didn’t have a car. I was struggling with the bills. The original hope was to get him a job where I work so he could ride with me, help pay the bills, and save up for a car. After he moved in, I agreed to let him use my car to DoorDash while I was at work or not using it. That way he could have a way to contribute to the bills until he found a job.

Well he couldn’t get on where I was at, and I got laid off due to the auto strike anyway. So he was still door dashing while I searched for another full-time, while working a part-time. I found another full-time, and have been there nearly 4 months. He still doesn’t have a job. I’m tired of waiting on him to find one, and I’m tired of him being in my car all the time. So it boiled over into me making it clear I wanted him out.

From his perspective, I’m ungrateful because he’s been helping pay the bills. I was way behind on the light bill, and on a payment plan, so it was super high every month. We recently got it caught up and back to a normal price. 

It’s true he has helped with the bills, but there are still some issues to me. One, he was supposed to get an actual job. Door dashing with my car was only supposed to be temporary, but now he’s been here for 10 months and that’s still what’s been going on. Also, he’s not even paying his full portion of the rent because he can’t make enough door dashing to do so. He’s been extremely short some months. He’s made me late to work at least twice not having my car home in time. He’s also running a lot of miles up. My car needs an oil change every 3 or 4 weeks.

6,1cun15u,AITA for inviting my mom and grandma to my son's birthday?,"My mom hasn't spoken to my grandma for eleven years, there's a lot of background there but to sum up there's a lot of unresolved stuff between them. 

I hadn't spoken to my grandma for about five years following my wedding because of the awkwardness in the family and my moving out of state for a few years. Since the last time that we spoke, I've had three total children and possibly am expecting a fourth.   
For a little over a year now, I've been considering reaching out to my grandma and breaking the cycle of silence and awkwardness so that her and my grandpa can meet my kids and we can all reconnect. 

Because I know how my mom feels, I wanted to feel her out about the idea a few months ago. It ended about as well as I thought it would; she went off on me and kept me on the phone for eight and a half hours until she convinced me it wasn't a good idea and I should leave things as is.   
But I didn't feel great about it and still felt the desire to reconnect with my grandma.  


Some time went by and I discussed it with my husband more. I decided to also seek counsel from a reverend at our church in addition to a family friend who knows all the involved parties and a very close friend and neighbor of mine, just to get some different perspectives.   
Everyone came back with the same general idea, that I shouldn't allow my mom's feelings for my grandma to determine my actions and I should make my own decision.   
My grandma has a lot of health problems, so I also had to consider that time is not on my side in this. 

When I finally reached out to her, I was so happy. It was like no time had passed and we just seamlessly reconnected. My kids all adored her and my grandpa and it just felt wonderful. 

A detail that's important to the next part is the the birthdays in question go like this:  
April 29th : My daughter's birthday  
April 30th : My mom's birthday  
May 1st : My husband's birthday  
In the meantime, my mom and I have begun to grow more distant due to different other issues and things that are completely unrelated. Despite this, I had the kids all sign a birthday card for her and I also did one of my own and sent it out. Now, due to a really small disagreement we had that I thought ended amicably, my mom ignored my daughter's birthday. She didn't acknowledge her in any way, didn't ask to come over or send her a card or anything. She didn't even call just to say happy birthday. I thought it was so strange because she told me weeks before that she had bought her a birthday gift.  
The next day was my mom's birthday, I didn't text or call her because I sent her a card (this is something she knows I do - I don't like birthday texts if I can help it, I find cards more personal).   
The following day was my husband's birthday and he got a very flowery text from her with emojis and such.  
We were both a little annoyed that she went out of her way to ignore or daughter's birthday and then to acknowledge my husband's. Hours later, about halfway through the day, I got a text from her that she finally got the birthday card, but according to her only the one from the kids. It wasn't until two days later that she said she got the one I sent her. I really have no explanation for this because I put them in the mailbox at the same time.  


Now, during all this time, I had started planning my son's birthday party.   
He asked me for my parents to come, so I knew I would be inviting them.  
However, he also asked me for my grandparents (specifically my grandfather, who he adored right away) to come. I honestly did not think that my mother would come, I figured that after ignoring my daughter's birthday she would make an excuse not to come to my son's party, so I decided to invite all of them figuring maybe none of them would or could come and the more I invited the better chances my son had of having relatives at his party. 

I invited my grandparents first thinking that if they couldn't come I wouldn't even have to mention anything about inviting them to my mom so as not to start any problems unnecessarily before my son's birthday. My grandma said they would try to come, so I next texted my mom to invite her and let her know I invited my grandparents.   
If I hadn't told her, it would have been WW3 and at my son's birthday party no less. I felt like I really had to tell her. 

She started going off on me right away saying I had changed and she could tell I was talking to them for a while (which was not true at all, I had only recently just reached out to my grandma after five years long after a lot of our problems had started).  
The next day she sent me a long text talking about how betrayed she felt and how much I had hurt her and some other things.   
I tried asking her about why she ignored Jasmine's birthday and she told me she didn't feel ""safe"" reaching out to me and wondered why I didn't reach out to her. She also said she wasn't happy that we didn't have her party on a day that would be easier for her (we just do the kids parties on their actual birthday, we changed the date last year only because I was in the hospital but it still just happened that the last two years all the kids birthdays were on weekends). She even went out of her way to say that she treasured the card from the kids and then mentioned she also appreciated getting mine ""days later"".   
I replied to her and tried to respond to every single point she made, whether in agreement or refuting a little bit. I really wanted us to discuss things and talk it out, especially the mix up with her birthday cards because it really bothers me that they didn't arrive on the same day! But she just sent me a short response after ignoring everything I had said.   
A couple days later, she suddenly called me to talk to my daughter while she was down for a nap. Now, my daughter has a lot of trouble with naptime so there was no way I was waking her.   
My mom got on the phone with this really weird tone and started asking for her then got all strange when I told her she was down for a nap. My mom went on to ask me for details about her naptime and just made me feel kind of uncomfortable. I tried to tell her this but she cut me off and said she didn't want to talk about anything right now and got off the phone. 

After this, I told my mom that I needed a break for a while.  
I just have too much on my plate right now and emotions are way too high. This whole thing has been causing me a lot of stress and it hasn't been good for my marriage or my kids. She didn't even respond to what I said, I would have loved a little ""I understand"" or any kind of acknowledgment of my feelings, but maybe I should expect radio silence when I ask for space?

I've started to feel guilty for ever inviting my mom to the party to begin with. If I hadn't, things would be really awkward still but at least it wouldn't have exploded. I genuinely did not think she would come, so maybe I shouldn't have bothered?  Or maybe I shouldn't have invited my grandma? Maybe my mom actually would have come if I hadn't? But my son wanted both of them there, I don't know.",TL;DR,2024-05-18,"AITA for inviting my mom and grandma to my son's birthday? My mom hasn't spoken to my grandma for eleven years, there's a lot of background there but to sum up there's a lot of unresolved stuff between them. 

I hadn't spoken to my grandma for about five years following my wedding because of the awkwardness in the family and my moving out of state for a few years. Since the last time that we spoke, I've had three total children and possibly am expecting a fourth.   
For a little over a year now, I've been considering reaching out to my grandma and breaking the cycle of silence and awkwardness so that her and my grandpa can meet my kids and we can all reconnect. 

Because I know how my mom feels, I wanted to feel her out about the idea a few months ago. It ended about as well as I thought it would; she went off on me and kept me on the phone for eight and a half hours until she convinced me it wasn't a good idea and I should leave things as is.   
But I didn't feel great about it and still felt the desire to reconnect with my grandma.  


Some time went by and I discussed it with my husband more. I decided to also seek counsel from a reverend at our church in addition to a family friend who knows all the involved parties and a very close friend and neighbor of mine, just to get some different perspectives.   
Everyone came back with the same general idea, that I shouldn't allow my mom's feelings for my grandma to determine my actions and I should make my own decision.   
My grandma has a lot of health problems, so I also had to consider that time is not on my side in this. 

When I finally reached out to her, I was so happy. It was like no time had passed and we just seamlessly reconnected. My kids all adored her and my grandpa and it just felt wonderful. 

A detail that's important to the next part is the the birthdays in question go like this:  
April 29th : My daughter's birthday  
April 30th : My mom's birthday  
May 1st : My husband's birthday  
In the meantime, my mom and I have begun to grow more distant due to different other issues and things that are completely unrelated. Despite this, I had the kids all sign a birthday card for her and I also did one of my own and sent it out. Now, due to a really small disagreement we had that I thought ended amicably, my mom ignored my daughter's birthday. She didn't acknowledge her in any way, didn't ask to come over or send her a card or anything. She didn't even call just to say happy birthday. I thought it was so strange because she told me weeks before that she had bought her a birthday gift.  
The next day was my mom's birthday, I didn't text or call her because I sent her a card (this is something she knows I do - I don't like birthday texts if I can help it, I find cards more personal).   
The following day was my husband's birthday and he got a very flowery text from her with emojis and such.  
We were both a little annoyed that she went out of her way to ignore or daughter's birthday and then to acknowledge my husband's. Hours later, about halfway through the day, I got a text from her that she finally got the birthday card, but according to her only the one from the kids. It wasn't until two days later that she said she got the one I sent her. I really have no explanation for this because I put them in the mailbox at the same time.  


Now, during all this time, I had started planning my son's birthday party.   
He asked me for my parents to come, so I knew I would be inviting them.  
However, he also asked me for my grandparents (specifically my grandfather, who he adored right away) to come. I honestly did not think that my mother would come, I figured that after ignoring my daughter's birthday she would make an excuse not to come to my son's party, so I decided to invite all of them figuring maybe none of them would or could come and the more I invited the better chances my son had of having relatives at his party. 

I invited my grandparents first thinking that if they couldn't come I wouldn't even have to mention anything about inviting them to my mom so as not to start any problems unnecessarily before my son's birthday. My grandma said they would try to come, so I next texted my mom to invite her and let her know I invited my grandparents.   
If I hadn't told her, it would have been WW3 and at my son's birthday party no less. I felt like I really had to tell her. 

She started going off on me right away saying I had changed and she could tell I was talking to them for a while (which was not true at all, I had only recently just reached out to my grandma after five years long after a lot of our problems had started).  
The next day she sent me a long text talking about how betrayed she felt and how much I had hurt her and some other things.   
I tried asking her about why she ignored Jasmine's birthday and she told me she didn't feel ""safe"" reaching out to me and wondered why I didn't reach out to her. She also said she wasn't happy that we didn't have her party on a day that would be easier for her (we just do the kids parties on their actual birthday, we changed the date last year only because I was in the hospital but it still just happened that the last two years all the kids birthdays were on weekends). She even went out of her way to say that she treasured the card from the kids and then mentioned she also appreciated getting mine ""days later"".   
I replied to her and tried to respond to every single point she made, whether in agreement or refuting a little bit. I really wanted us to discuss things and talk it out, especially the mix up with her birthday cards because it really bothers me that they didn't arrive on the same day! But she just sent me a short response after ignoring everything I had said.   
A couple days later, she suddenly called me to talk to my daughter while she was down for a nap. Now, my daughter has a lot of trouble with naptime so there was no way I was waking her.   
My mom got on the phone with this really weird tone and started asking for her then got all strange when I told her she was down for a nap. My mom went on to ask me for details about her naptime and just made me feel kind of uncomfortable. I tried to tell her this but she cut me off and said she didn't want to talk about anything right now and got off the phone. 

After this, I told my mom that I needed a break for a while.  
I just have too much on my plate right now and emotions are way too high. This whole thing has been causing me a lot of stress and it hasn't been good for my marriage or my kids. She didn't even respond to what I said, I would have loved a little ""I understand"" or any kind of acknowledgment of my feelings, but maybe I should expect radio silence when I ask for space?

7,1cumq7o,AITA for making my mom change her wedding day? ,"I (20F) got engaged in Miami last year on June 27th. My wedding is planned for June 22nd, as the 27th is a weekday. Last night my mom (51F) called to tell me she had to tell me something before anyone else could. Shes also getting married, originally planning on getting married August 2025. She preceded to tell me she is moving up the wedding a whole year, to next month, the 27th. (For context, she met her fiancé the same day I got engaged, on the 27th.) 

I politely reminded her that that was the day I got engaged, (she was there) and told her that that day was special to me, regardless I don’t even approve of the guy she’s marrying, as they haven’t even known each other a full year. 

She assured me this wasn’t gonna be the “real” wedding and just for legal reasons. I asked her if she could move the day up to the 28th or 26th, just not the 27th. To which she responded “lots of things happen the same day” completely disregarding my feelings.

I ended up hanging up on her out of pure anger and blocked her on iMessages. I told her to fix the date or she will remain blocked. She texted me on instagram saying she didn’t mean to hurt my feelings, however she wasn’t planning on changing the date. 

I have concerns about her fiancé, who doesn’t have legal status in this country, I’ve even suspicious since day one about him. She also refuses to sign a prenup. 

She just texted me on instagram letting me know she had “hot gossip” to tell me. To which I said “get a husband and loose your daughter, or fix this.” She then told me the dates can’t be changed as plane tickets for her friends had already been booked and arranged. She said it was my choice to come to the wedding or not. Now I’m stunned, not only did she take my anniversary date, but went behind my back and arranged everything without my knowledge, her only child.

8,1cumoi4,AITA for Not Sticking Up for My Brother After My Boyfriend Called Him Out?,"I'm in a really tough spot and could use some perspective. I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend, Alex (31M), for about a year now. He’s been wonderful and supportive, especially through some difficult times. One of those difficult times involves my relationship with my older brother, Tom (33M).

Tom and I have always had a complicated relationship. Growing up, he was the golden child and I often felt like the family doormat. He would tease me mercilessly, make fun of my interests, and generally treat me like I was beneath him. Our parents rarely intervened, often brushing it off as typical sibling behavior or even enabling it by saying things like ""boys will be boys"" or ""he's just joking, don’t be so sensitive.""

This dynamic continued into adulthood. Tom still makes condescending comments, dismisses my achievements, and often expects me to drop everything to help him out, all without any gratitude or reciprocation. I've tried to talk to him about it before, but he just laughs it off or accuses me of overreacting.

For context, I work at a museum in our city, a job I’m really passionate about but Tom often belittles. He thinks it’s a waste of time and constantly tells me I could do something more “useful” with my life.

Last weekend, Alex and I were at a family gathering. Tom was in rare form, belittling me in front of everyone about my job. I was trying to brush it off as usual, but Alex wasn’t having it. He stepped in and told Tom to stop treating me like a doormat and to start respecting me as an equal.

Things escalated quickly. Tom got defensive and the situation turned into a heated argument. Alex called Tom out on all the times he’s treated me poorly and accused him of being a bully. Tom fired back, saying Alex didn’t know what he was talking about and should mind his own business. Our parents tried to diffuse the situation but ended up taking Tom's side, saying Alex was overstepping and causing unnecessary drama.

Now, Tom is furious with me. He says I should have stuck up for him and defended him against Alex. He claims that by not doing so, I’ve betrayed our family and humiliated him in front of everyone. My parents are also disappointed, feeling like I should have controlled the situation better.

Alex feels bad that things got so heated but stands by his actions, saying someone needed to finally call Tom out on his behavior. I’m torn. On one hand, I appreciate Alex standing up for me, but on the other hand, I feel guilty for not defending my brother in that moment.

AITA for not sticking up for my brother? Should I have done something to defuse this situation?

**ETA:** I wanted to add that part of why I didn’t defend Alex more strongly is because, whenever I did try to say something in his defense, my parents just bulldozed over me. Every time I tried to speak they'd yell over me, which brought back all the feelings of clamming up like I did when I was younger. It made me freeze up and just stand there, especially since it seemed to only make Tom even angrier. I felt trapped, not knowing how to diffuse the tension as it got worse and worse. I’m working on it but it's not easy, especially in situations like this. By the end of the entire thing I was just standing there crying and Alex took me to our car to go home. I've been fielding phone calls from my parents and brother since last weekend.

She and my uncle usually do step in to diffuse these situations when they're around but they were both in the kitchen when this happened.

9,1cumo3m,AITA for not considering my parents to be my parents?,"So me (14 F) my two little sisters now (12 F) and (10 F). a little context both of my parents have a very long history with drug abuse I mean like my mom has overdosed over like 20 times in the last 10 years and a very long criminal records and have gotten in trouble with CPS many many times and me and my sisters have been talked to by the social workers more times than we can count. So lets got back 6-7 years, everything was good for the most part and my dad (lets call him Jimmy and my mom Samantha for the stake of the post) and my sisters had this nice house where we all got our own rooms and we were living the american dream for the most part. But the only thing missing from my american dream was my mother, when my parents got divorced it was and actual shit show (Jimmy found out my mom Samantha was cheating on him). After my parents got a divorce nothing was the same ever again. (I know that sounds cheesy but it's the truth ). What I mean by that is that I didn't see my mom for over 2 years, whenever i would ask my dad if we could see our mom my dad would always reply with something along the lines of ""The reason your mom isn't here right now is because she doesn't want to be here."" Which to me and my sisters was absolutely heartbreaking for young kids to hear and so the more and more we would ask we started growing some sort of resentment of our mom and because of that we got a lot closer with Jimmy. (which now thinking about it he was a horrible parent but I'll get to that a bit farther down the post.) so lets fast forwards to about a year and a half ago when i was 12 my sisters were 8 and 10. We moved to a really small town with about 150-300 people there and we were living with our step-moms mom (our step-mom was an absolute sweetheart btw.)  So about two and a half weeks of living there the cops show up to our door and walk in saying that me and my sisters have 10 minutes to pack as many things as we can and we drove to our grandmas house which we didn't know were we were going until we got into the car with everything we could fit into our tiny backpacks and we looked horrible we smelt horrible our hair greasier than McDonald's fries with ragged hair cuts and with holes in our clothes and shoes with miserable looks on our faces. It was only then we were told what was going on we were getting but into out of home placement with out grandma. When we got pulled from our house CPS already had enough evidence to take us from Jimmy and Samantha so they could start a case on them. We found out we were going to court which it was then when we also found out what they were doing (they as in my dad, mom and my step-mom) after i found out how long they've been using I broke down and cried about how much i hated them because it opened my eyes to how much Jimmy and Samantha had abused us and how we never had an actual stable childhood and made me realize how many fucked up things Jimmy and Samantha had done to us for example: steal our money that we worked our asses of from our lemonade stand, would talk shit about each other, would go days on end without making us food, anytime they would get money instead of getting groceries they would buy hard drugs like meth and heroine even though our fridge was empty and pantry had nothing but breadcrumbs and sugar, I had to raise my younger siblings and my newborn baby brother and when I mean raise my siblings I mean i did everything that a mother would do like i cooked for everybody even when my parents had a full blown party i had to cook for them too, I also cleaned up after everyone, did every single persons laundry, and I know there is more those are just the main ones.

It only started to bother me a few weeks ago when she made comments that I looked like a man, looked big and just ugly cause I gained muscle from working out a lot. It sounds really bad but I just stopped going out with her. She later came to me asking why I never go with her anywhere, why I always look depressed, and that she's just getting embarrassed to be seen with me after work now, I just stayed quiet and didn't answer. She's mad at me now and won't talk to me. This was probably a stupid post but AITA?",0.0,0.00024431455,0,1
11,1cuml01,WIBTA for giving my child a similar name to my sibling's dead name?,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. 

My husband (23M) and I (22F) are expecting our first child in July, a girl. We're over the moon and couldn't be happier. 

We've both decided we want to name her Annette. My mom's (who I'm very close with) middle name is Anne, and my husband had a favorite teacher named Annette who made a really big impact on him. I think it's a super pretty, classic name, and it honors my mom. It's also one of the few names my husband and I could agree on. 

I have an eighteen-year-old sibling who is nonbinary, and I've always done my best to support them. I love them, even though we're not the closest, and I consider myself an ally. Their deadname (the name they were given at birth which they no longer use) is Anna. 

I saw them earlier tonight and they wanted to know if we'd decided on a name yet. I told them we loved the name Annette and were planning on using it, and they flipped out. They told me that it was way too similar to their deadname and it would be transphobic of me to name my daughter that. I explained that it's a variant of a family name, and how the intention was by no means meant to hurt them. My sibling wasn't having any of this, and told me that I was being an abusive narcissist. 

The name just feels *right* though, and my husband and I love it. I really don't see all that much similarity between the names, except that they both start with ""An"". They're even pronounced differently (""uh-NET"" vs ""AN-a"" with a hard ""a""). If it would be transphobic to use the name though, I don't want to use it.

13,1cumbi4,AITA for telling my Mom that I’m angry with her because she gave away my inheritance. ,"My(32f) grandma(83f) has been showing signs of dementia and is in poor health because of a recent fall and arm break. My Mom (61f) is in the process of getting her moved out of her house and into a nursing home where she will have supervision and a better quality of life. This means downsizing and selling a lot of her things. My grandma is an avid sewer and crafter and because I’m the only person in the family who enjoys sewing and really appreciates her craft and skill in quilting I inherited all of her sewing stuff. I took all of the pieces that she had already started working on and some good basic fabric that I can use to make a few quilts and also a bunch of tools that I can use like scissors, needles, thread etc. the rest (and there’s a lot of it) I left for my mom to sell at a garage sale that will help pay for her nursing home and general expenses. I offered to organize the fabric that I didn’t take  into different categories so it could be more easily priced and sold. My mom said not to bother, that it would all get handled. Today was the first day of the garage sale. My mom just texted me and said they’ve made over $1000 in the first day and they’re pretty happy with that. I asked her if she sold any of the fabric yet and she told me that they were giving the fabric away to anyone who wanted it because “that’s what she would have wanted”. I feel completely and utterly betrayed by this. Not because I want the fabric, but because it feels like they aren’t valuing this huge lifetime passion that she had. Giving it all away for free feels so incredibly disrespectful to both me and her that I am breathtakingly angry right now and told my mom as much. I don’t know if I can even be friendly to someone who disrespects the passion of a loved one and who so fundamentally doesn’t understand where I’m coming from. Am I being a crazy asshole? I know that anger can be a part of the grief process and everyone grieves differently but this already feels like something that I will never forgive her for. Are there any quilters or crafters out there who understand what I mean? Am a just grieving and letting my emotions get the better of me or is this completely heartless behavior? I feel completely powerless to stop any of this. 

Update: To answer some confusion that people have: 
I don’t have unrealistic expectations about how garage sales work. I wasn’t expecting to get top dollar for any of the fabric, nor is it bad old fabric that’s been improperly stored. This is all good fabric that I wanted people to be able to use as I could not take all of it. It’s not that it was given away because it wasn’t appealing to buyers. 

I am not mad that people took it. I’m mad she isn’t being compensated. 

I’m mad that my mom GAVE IT AWAY at a garage sale. I left it in the expectation that my mom would sell it for SOME amount of money even if it was well below the market value. 
I offered to price all of it, and organize it so that she didn’t have to because I knew she didn’t appreciate sewing. She refused my help and said that she would take care of it. I left a lot of really good prices knowing that they could sell and that proceeds would go to my grandma. 

My mom is well off and is not struggling financially at all. She will also be renting out my grandmas house which will almost entirely cover the cost of the nursing home. 

Some people have said it’s my fault for not taking it, and I agree with that at this point. If I had known she was going to give it away to strangers I definitely would have taken all of it and sold it myself or even passed some of it to other people in her life who know her and are quilters. It feels flippant and callous to just give it away to strangers. I was under the impression that 1) SOME money would be going to my grandma, as is fitting and 2) people would still be getting a good deal on some nice fabric. People were very happy to get free fabric and I can’t blame them. My Grandma was never really appreciated for her skills and was a very humble and kind person. And you know what, she probably would be totally happy to just give all of her stuff away which is why I’m irate that she isn’t being compensated at all. She should get some of what she deserves for the value of her things ESPECIALLY because it was things associated with her passion and art the way she expressed herself. It feels morally wrong.

Since 2021 he's been seeing different women, calling them ""friends"" to avoid me finding out about them. I found this out recently because at a party here in my new city I met some former interns from his office who told me ""yeah you know he's been seeing J, then P, but he seems serious about this T one"" and were stunned I didn't know. I played it cool and let them describe the situation. Soon after, the same T woman called me (dad gave her my number), and left a voicemail for me to ""call me back baby, bye!"" I never did. She then texted me several texts, including photos of them together on a date and her inside the family farm admiring the place. I didn't respond. Finally on superbowl, dad says ""here you wanna talk to my friend?"" and I said fine thinking it was a guy. It was T; so I just asked her ""why are you harassing me with calls/texts/voicemails?"" She refused to really answer, stammering like ""i uh, I don't do voicemails"" so I texted her the voicemail transcript, and blocked her after she didn't respond within 3 days.

Yes I probably sound immature. My thing is to me it's disrespectful to not say ""I am dating now for a permanent partner"" instead of doing it (I lived at home after mom died so there were times I was stuck with the animals while he was off having fun) and then having this T woman happily serve as the introduction person.

I now feel some guilt, my Husband has told me if I want to make me feel better he'll give her money but that seems like a bad idea as she'd likely use it badly or blow through it then expect more.

We have allowed My Mother one supervised visit per month so she's not totally cut off from my sister but it was during these visits things went badly as she saw how she was dressed and the toys she had, and realised they were expensive. She began to rip into us for hiding the fact we have money and how if we'd just given her money she'd have not given us my sister as she could have taken care of her better.

I told her while we have some money its mostly my husbands parents money not ours so she had no right to know about it, also that I wouldn't have given her money anyway as I didn't trust her. She broke down calling me a selfish bitch who'd never considered how hard things were for her.

I now feel some guilt, my Husband has told me if I want to make me feel better he'll give her money but that seems like a bad idea as she'd likely use it badly or blow through it then expect more. Despite this though I do feel bad, maybe I should have tried to help her more now my luck is better, or maybe I should have been honest with her. AITA for keeping this from her?",0.0,0.025230352,0,1

19,1cuk86l,AITA for prioritising my job over my grandma’s birthday?,"So, I’m(30F) pretty much estranged from my dad’s side of the family. Bar a few family members, I don’t even feel like a member of that side of my family, through no fault of my own (so much so I legally changed my surname). 

My grandma (who has favourited my older cousin my entire life) has been ill a couple of times this year and has ended up in hospital, and with her 80th birthday coming up, some family members have been concerned. 

As much of a black sheep she has made me feel my entire life and how judgemental she is of me, she’s my grandma and I do genuinely love and care about her. So, for a few weeks I kept in touch with her, asking her how she is and if I would be okay to come and visit. She kept telling me she wasn’t up to visitors, even though the rest of my family are welcome to come and go as they please, so eventually I gave up asking. 

As my grandma is turning 80, a family meal has been arranged. I have work on the day of the meal but the original time of the meal left me with plenty of time to get ready and get there after my shift. However, my aunt decided the original time was too late and decided to go ahead and change the booking to an earlier time without checking that everyone would still be able to attend. 

I explained that I have work that day and that the new time just wouldn’t be enough time for me to get ready and get to the restaurant (as I live a 45 minute drive away from the restaurant too) and I was met with a bombard of messages telling me to fake being sick or use a holiday day because “it’s not everyday your grandma turns 80”. I’d love to be able to attend, not only for my grandma but it would be the first time I’d be introducing my grandparents to my partner, but I have no holidays left for this year and I don’t feel right about pretending to be sick just so I can go to a meal. They’re acting like I just don’t care or want to see her even though I’ve reached out and asked to visit numerous times.

20,1cuk4of,AITA for wanting to wear my own outfit to graduation?,"I'm 17, currently graduating my Senior year of highschool.

I came out as trans to my parents about 2 years ago now, back when I was a Sophomore (I’d known for longer). I've completely regretted it ever since and went back into the closet, I just tell my parents I'm a masculine woman and I was confused. A lot happened and I've been called a lot of names (slurs) by both of my parents, mainly my mother. She's done that long before I came out to her though because of my choice of style. She's said some incredibly hurtful things to me outside of the name calling like how she wishes she never had me, that I'm a failure/disappointment, ""what would your grandparents think??"" etc specifically because of how I dress.

Finding a way that I like to dress that makes me more comfortable has changed a lot for me and it's really helped me with self-image issues I’d had. I know my parents don't see it this way, and I know it's upsetting to them but I just feel terrible whenever I'm forced to wear dresses, outfits that show cleavage, or other just generally girly things not by choice. I've tried to make compromises with my mom about dressier pants, blouses, and so on but she always says that I'm doing it to spite her or upset her intentionally. She calls me a dyke, a carpet muncher, says that she's ashamed of me, ""why can't you just be like other girls / Other girls don't dress like this,"" idk she just gets mean about it? Why would you say these kinds of things to your own kid?? I've tried explaining to her that it's a style I like and that wearing girly things makes me feel uncomfortable but she always dismisses it by saying I used to wear those kinds of things all the time.

For graduation, I'd sat down with my mom to look at outfits and she went over a lot of the usual things that tended to be revealing, or things she knows I don't like but wants me to wear anyways, so I try to compromise. I picked out something that she and I both liked which was overall shorts with a white shirt underneath. She ended up not ordering it, saying that I was ""indecisive"" when I'd been pretty clear that I liked it and she seemingly did too, but now it's too late and it won't be here on time, so she's trying to force me to go out and buy a dress or something else with her. I tried to convince her to let me wear a blouse and nice pants but she blowed up and it turned into a big argument. She said I'm ""selfish and don't care about anyone's feelings but my own” for not wearing something that practically has my tits hanging out, which I am NOT comfortable with.

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear something I'm comfortable in for graduation? I know I can only see from my own perspective and I am not asking for advice.

It's been okay at it best and abusive at its worst. She prefers boys. If I do anything wrong I never hear the end of it. She still talks about the stuff I did when I was 15. I am now 21. Stuff I did at 15- 17 included:
At 15 -Sneaking out and going to the speedway for snacks or to see my boyfriend at the time. (Admittedly I also called police on myself when I over slept one night and it turned into a huge mess. But again 15 year old stupidity. After that I didn't do anything but every once and while sneak onto the deck at night and listen to the crickets and stuff at night).At 16 -I would sometimes accidentally sleep through my baby nieces crying on the monitor and my step mom would have to get them. 
I wasn't keep good grades
I forgot to take my medicine some times.I got caught vaping at school (big thing that was happening when I was in high-school.I kept hiding food and wrappers in my room, drawing bugs.Ran away bc I was called stupid, a fa**ot, and a bitch when I came out as bi/pansexual for a few months by my adoptive dad
At 17 i left home for good. 
I got tired bc through all of that I was never given a chance to redeem or earn trust bc and i quote ""i dont deserve a chance bc i would just let them down. Id go months without doing anything wrong. She would dangle my tv, book reading, or even outside privileges in my face saying ""if your good for 1 more week your punishment will be over"". Only to get mad that I did something small like forget wipe down a shelf while dusting or if i got a 75 on a school paper. Stating i wasn't trying my hardest and why couldn't be more like my older brother (my bio brother who was a year older then me, not my step brother) I couldn't do anything right in her eyes so I decided that if I was going to get in trouble no matter what I did or how good I would be then I was just going to stop caring what she thought. So yeah I was the best kid, but I have gotten better. I have my own place now with my son and fiance, a stable job, and I of course have calmed down. Unfortuantly where I'm living has become too expensive and crazy so we have decided to move to another state that is cheaper and also closer to my fiancé's family who has only seen my son once. We think it'll be a fresh start. Exactly what we need. However last year thing between me and my fiance wasn't as good and resulted in me and my son going to back home to take some time apart from each other and figure things out. In the 5 months we were there a lot happened. Mostly my step mom almost  manipulating me into cutting my fiance out of my son's life completely and going with another guy she liked. She would tell me since we were under her roof she had a say in what happened and who could take my son.I was such a mess that I almost let it happen until my fiance woke me up to what was actually happening.

22,1cvapjx,AITA for yelling at my mother in law and ruining my wife's birthday ,"Me and my wife both 33 YO Indian couple have a 4 year old son. My son has beautiful long hair so he often gets mistaken for a girl, but he loves his hair and so do we. To celebrate my wife's birthday, we flew to Melbourne from Sydney and booked a 3 bedroom Airbnb as my in-laws were going to join us. 
Due to some complication with their travel, my in-laws could not travel on the intended date and so me, my wife and son went on ahead. My in-laws arrive a day later and I picked them up from the airport. One of the comments from my mum-in-law was that my son's fringe is too long and covers his eyes so it needs to be cut. Both me and my wife said that we love the way he looks but we were considering a proper haircut soon.
We were all excited as the next day was my wife's birthday and we had booked a guided tour of the city with a photographer. It all went as planned and we returned home around 3pm. I was exhausted as I've been carrying around the heavy bags throughout as my in-laws are 55+ and just came of an 11 hour plane ride yesterday.
Around 4pm my wife wanted to visit a beach about 10 mins from the Airbnb. As it was my wife's birthday and I didn't want to let her down, I downed half a glass of wine and went with her. Our son stayed back with his grandparents as it would be his sleeping time soon. 
Me and my wife had some much needed alone time and things seemed great. We picked up some snacks and pastries on the way home as we skipped cake for this birthday. But little did I know how things were going to turn out when we returned to the Airbnb. 
Everything was fine till about 5 mins when I noticed that half of my son's bangs were gone. This was something I kept warning my mother-in-law the whole day not to do and the moment we were away from an hour she did it. I went off, I dunno if it was the wine or the exhaustion but I couldn't hold my emotions back. Yelled that it was a massive breach of trust literally within 24 hours of entering the country. My wife was pissed as well but she never holds her mom accountable so I feel I had to as a line was crossed.
Intentions aside, I know it's hair and it will grow back but my trust was gone.
My mother-in-law started crying and my wife helped calm the air. My wife was neutral and explained to me that I should have been more careful with my words as per our culture we always show respect to our elderly.
Later, I apologized to everyone for making a scene and things looked good. The next morning however, my wife blamed me for ruining her birthday, disrespecting her mother and causing a scene.
I dunno what I should do as I feel with all my heart that what my mother-in-law did was crossing a line and if anything me reacting this way would make her think twice about going behind our backs again.

25,1cvai74,AITA for trying to take my friend’s mind off her difficult situation,"My (36F) friend (37F) has been very ill recently and has been updating us in our group on what’s been happening to her. I wasn’t able to visit her during this time due to my busy schedule but after some weeks I made some time and visited her this week. 

When I got there I took her a little gift and was chatting to her about everything I’ve been up to with work and vacation trips, the beautiful locations and experiences and keeping the conversation positive and uplifting. After awhile in the middle of that she started talking about her illness, time in hospital and all the traumatic and difficult stuff that happened to her. I told her she doesn’t need to re-live all that by talking about it, and she said it helps - but she’s already told us everything in messages and it was just going to get her down again so I changed the subject to house renovations as I’ve just bought a house and it’s a good easy subject for her to take her mind off things too. 

She listened for awhile and then when there was a break in the conversation she tried to steer it back to talking about how difficult it’s been for her and more stuff about what happened in the hospital which she hadn’t told us before. It wasn’t very nice stuff so I listened for a bit quietly to her but didn’t encourage it and then changed the subject to one of the countries I’ve just been to and the stunning scenery and amazing food we had, trying to talk about something positive and inspiring. She seemed to listen half heartedly, responding a little here and there with barely there comments and then it was time for me to go and we said our goodbyes. Again at the door she tried to start talking about all the stuff she’s been through and it started to feel quite inappropriate so I tried to wrap things up and said I needed to go walking away. 

Later in the evening I got a text from her saying she doesn’t understand why I visited her at all when all I did was come to boast about my holidays and amazing life updates and didn’t want to know about her illness.

I was a bit annoyed and told her that she needs to focus on helping the family and especially the dog, who is depending on her to take care of him. She told me she understands but it's still just a bit hard for her, especially given that she isn't really a dog person.

That really irked me and I told her to get over herself, that she doesn't get to whine about being asked to help, and that she needs to learn to like dogs. She didn't say anything else and just went upstairs to her room.

27,1cva3j9,AITA for not moving my wedding date? *UPDATE*,"Hey everyone! It's been a while (I forgot my password), but a few people asked for updates on how my last post turned out. Unfortunately, a lot of you may not like the answer. 

Almost all of you said not to change the date, and to enjoy my time without them there. I followed half of that advice. I eventually did relent to my family and change the date of the wedding. My fiancé (now husband!) said that the date wasn't as important as my happiness, and the fighting with my parents was destroying that. Now after six months, we both wish we hadn't because it was useless.

They still didn't show up. Not only that, but they convinced 90% of my family not to show up either. I ended up with only four relatives there in a crowd of about 100 guests.

My mother claimed that I had been ""excluding her from planning"" (by scheduling venue tours on days that my fiance and I were both free but I didn't realize she was working, and by finding my dress by surprise on a ""just here to look"" trip without her being there). They hadn't shown any interest in planning, so I mainly didn't want to bother them. To them, this was ""clearly a sign that you don't want us there"". So they went out of town on the new date.

In the end, narcissist mother still got her yoga, I still moved my date, and I still walked myself down the aisle.

But my petty self did, in fact, strike back. I had an amazing time, and I made sure that I left obvious empty seats marked for them and told everyone the truth with a smile when they asked. The few family members that did show are now no longer speaking to them either, as are all of the friends who came. The only exception is my brother (who I'm pretty sure they asked to relay the details of the party to them), and even he has almost entirely cut them out due to how they've acted.

I haven't spoken to my mother since about a month before the wedding, when she told me to get all of my old things out of her house. I speak to my father very rarely, and only over things like deaths in the family. My in-laws have basically taken me in as their own, and I'm far happier than I ever was in the nightmare of a family I grew up with. Life is good.

28,1cv9vho,AITA for making my sister-in-law pay for a professional cleaning service after she cooked in my kitchen?,"Last week, I invited my sister-in-law, who loves cooking, to stay with us. She offered to cook dinner as a way to show her gratitude. However, I have a meticulously organized and spotless kitchen due to my severe anxiety around mess and disorder, something that my family is well aware of.

Despite this, after she cooked, the kitchen was left in what I would consider a disastrous state—spills on the counter, pots not cleaned properly, and utensils misplaced. It took me hours just to calm down after seeing the mess. The next day, I calmly explained how distressed it made me feel and asked if she could cover the cost of a professional cleaning service to restore it to its original condition.

She was shocked and upset by my request, arguing that she had already contributed by buying groceries and spending her evening cooking for us. My husband thinks I was too harsh and should have cleaned it myself or let it go this time. This has caused tension between us and his sister.

29,1cv9lo0,AITA: financial abuse allegation,"Ex and I are both 40, together for six years, w/a two year old. I ended the relationship in March  due to ongoing escalated emotional abuse. I own the house we live in live in; he considers that power I hold over him, I consider it a barrier to me leaving.

I’m sole income earner since he decided to quit his job in March 2022 (I supported the decision at the time, he also never took any steps to have a conversation with me about finances) and have paid all the bills, groceries, baby gear, etc. Baby came in May 2022, when I returned to work Nov 2022 he was the caretaker while i worked FT. I offered that he could work too, he declined. My understanding is that from his prior work he had ~$10k in the bank. We never got married or combined our financial assets. Over the last couple of years I’ve been able to save a bit of money in addition to money I had before. I considered it all joint assets, even though his name has not been on my bank account. I never prevented him from having access to it via my credit card. I have never dictated how he spends his own money. 

In Feb 2024, he had made statements about feeling trapped; said violence is the only reasonable outcome in a relationship with someone like me. I wrote him a check for $10k, a little more than half of what was in my bank account. He accused me of leaving him money as if he was a prostitute. I apologized many times for the unintended impact. Over the next 3 weeks he didn’t cash the check and continue to berate me about it. I ended up canceling the check 3 wks in - some stress d/t a tax bill I didn’t anticipate. I saw that check as a way I was trying to help him feel less trapped and him being able to hold shared assets. When I ended the relationship finally in the middle of the check ordeal it became  no longer about him holding shared assets and about dividing them. $10k leaves him with a little more than half the savings I have at this point (including my savings from before), me with a toddler to care for etc. On 5/6 I asked what he needed from me and the response was just “$10k”, I gave him $7.5k with the stipulation that he needs to be out by June 1st (~3mos from when I asked him to leave so not a super long time considering he doesn’t have a job but not insignificant) to get the other $2.5k. I held that money because in the event that he’s not out, I need to have money available to cover a short term rental so I can leave until he is gone.

He believes it is financially abusive to have written a check in the first place, cancelled the initial check (I could have been more direct about and have been accountable for that), asked for ongoing input on a lesser amount that would feel doable within a range (which he didn’t answer), and then put stipulations on his demand for $10,000 (providing $7,500 with the rest when he moves out within a time frame that is 3 months from when I originally asked him to leave due to ongoing emotional abuse which has not stopped).",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA: financial abuse allegation Ex and I are both 40, together for six years, w/a two year old.

During the year 2022 to February of 2023, Bridget of I were the bestest of friends. One day out of the blue, a girl came up to me and explained how Bridget has been saying that my boyfriend, who I had just started dating, and her had more in common and they clicked. I had heard earlier from a friend ,that my boyfriend was talking about some girl and it was one of my friends but Bridget had convinced me it was a friend Nella. I was going to cut her off that day and confront her but when I heard this news from the girl, I knew in my heart that Bridget was the one talking to my boyfriend. I comforted her about it that day, and she told me she was, all in all, too scared to tell me. I could understand that but what I couldn’t understand was the dragging in of Nella into this situation as a scapegoat essentially. I cut her off but eventually later down the line ,we became cordial again. 

 Fast forward to May 2024, and I get text message from Bridget. My gut ultimately knew something was wrong. She told me she had heard that I was discussing the situation that happened in 2023. I did not deny this but instead asked her was I not supposed to. She then said and admitted that it made her look like a bad person and that I was going behind her back to turn people against her.

I did and have not shown any of the screenshots or messages that are occurred during the time because in my opinion, there’s no need to open up old wounds.

 Bridget got extremely angry and and told me to keep her name out of my mouth .

I think ""That's either the hose in the garage or the faucet in the laundry room,"" and eventually leave. I enter the laundry room almost slipping only to see a puddle of water near the door frame. I look to the left and see the sink full of water and a running faucet. (Not dripping, ON) I go upstairs and find my brother (whom I will refer to as Jason) on the computer. I ask him what happened and he exclaims ""I didn't do anything!"" I show him the mess and he says ""Did you clog it?"" and I show him how running water can still escape if on for an hour or two. I try to explain how this is a big deal since it was not only a hazard but a costly ""mistake"" due to the water bills. Every question and statement I make is either shrugged off or taken insultingly as if I was yelling at trash. Eventually, he leaves after screaming ""I'll f\*cking do it tomorrow!"" and slams the door. I didn't even raise my voice at all but to this day, I still don't know why he didn't take it seriously.",0.0,0.10965512692928314,0,1

Ella has been dating her boyfriend (m15)for 3 months now. He's a nice person and has nice character however recently he has started making sexual jokes about me and my situationship(m15). I'll call my situationship Philip. In the past Philip has made sexual jokes about me and him such as saying ""youll be paralysed after"", ""take that top off"" and ""can I shower with you?"" And Ella and her bf know about these as I have told them about it. However I don't bring up these jokes as though they are ""tame"" I chose to forgive and forget Philip and his sexual sense of humour. However, I have also expressed my dislike of sexual jokes about me to both Ella and her bf. For context, at school we hang out inside however I wanted to go outside, coincidently that's where Philip hangs out. As a joke, I kept trying to convince them to go outside however they all refused. This was when Ella's bf started making jokes such as ""why don't you go outside alone and suck Philips dick"" and ""go make out with Philip""  and bringing up the past jokes Philip had made towards me that I don't bring up anymore as they make me cringe and uncomfortable. He carried on saying these jokes even after I told him to stop. After school, I then informed Philip of these jokes being made about him as this has happened before with a different friend who told me I should ""ride his tiny dick"" also as a joke. Philip told me to tell Ella's bf to stop. So I messaged Ella and told her that her bfs jokes make me feel uncomfortable. She said she'll tell him. His response to me telling him to stop making sexual jokes was ""I'll stop if she stops being annoying"" this is what she said according to Ella. However, Ella told another friend of mine that he called me a bitch, I only found out about this the next day. So I then asked Ella's how I was being annoying as I am asking her bf to stop making jokes at my expense as they make me uncomfortable. She then responded with ""idk"". So I then said ""I know I can be annoying but that only when your bf is being unnecessarily mean towards me."" She then informed me that instead of changing his behaviour he will ""just leave"".
So I responded with ""im not asking him to go I'm just asking him to stop making sexual jokes at my expense in the nicest way I can"" Ella then accused me of being angry and passive aggressive. I then told her that I wasn't angry but if I was that would be justified. Ella then said ""I know but he said he'll stop"" she then called my tone bitchy so I told her to not analyse my texts as I'm not thinking too deeply into my texts. I'm not trying to come across as anything as I'm typing and not necessarily thinking when I do so. The next day, another friend told me that Ella told her that I had ""slagged"" her bf off when telling her to tell him to stop making sexual jokes. So am I the asshole because I honestly feel so bad but then again I feel like I'm in the right for setting a boundary?

36,1cv8g2x,WIBTA for not recognizing my sister as part of my family,"I am a minor in middle school, and my sister mentioned in the title will be Sarah (24). My oldest sister will be Katie (26). My parents are both great people. Sarah is diagnosed with ADHD, depression, OCD, and anxiety.

For context, Sarah has been mistreating me for a long time. As child, she always locked me in rooms to yell at me and forced me to do things I was not comfortable with. I remember once she had locked me in her room, and she was just screaming at me . I was probably 3-4 at the time and I couldn't understand anything. I remember my mom wanting her to let me out, and I was just thinking if I threw up on her bed then she would let me out. I forced myself to throw up, and she let me out. After this she would just hold the door shut instead of locking because I was 10+ years younger and I couldn't open it. Another thing she did was always scream at my parents and specifically yell at my dad to divorce my mom. Today, I still hate going on car rides or being alone in the same room as her, even if the door is open. She's never apologized for those things. 

Around 2021, she was moving back from her apartment to my house (she only lived in the apartment for \~8m). Her depression was very bad at the time, and when moving her furniture back, everyone in my family helped except for her. Additionally, she has not had a job for 4+ years, and she has been freeloading off my parents the entire time.

She yells at me for throwing her depressive episode in her face when I bring up past things she did. She called me entitled because I wasn't helping my mom clean, and I bring up the fact that while everyone helped her move she did nothing. She says I demonize mental health because I'm shaming her for having depression. I don't blame her for what she did, but I do think I am allowed to bring it up. I hate hypocrites. I've had two friends get hospitalized due to depression related events, and I myself struggle with finding a reason to live. I do not demonize mental health, and I am disgusted that she would accuse me of that. She calls me entitled, selfish, and more just because I don't love sharing my things as much as she does.

Another thing she does is that she always tries to act like a big sister to me. This mostly started when she moved back in 2021. She tries to parent me, tell me what to do, lecture me, etc. She is anything but a caretaker to me. She ruined my childhood, and I literally had to take care of HER for multiple years during quarantine. I know that depression is tough to handle, and I don't mind helping her. I do mind it though when she ignores the fact that she has literally had 0 parts in raising me to be a good person. Every negative trait I don't like about myself comes from her.

37,1cv8dcs,AITA for doing most of the group project work and then being accused of not involving others?,"I'm in a university group project, working with three other people: 1 guy (let’s call him Mike) & 2 girls. It requires weekly progress updates.

Here’s little backstory: I suggested evening meetings during the week to discuss and work on the project together, instead, my group decided to meet briefly after our weekly Monday class (which ends at 8 PM). As you can assume we rarely stayed to discuss work. Communication has been minimal, and nobody really took initiative until Monday rolls around. By then, driven by guilt and a sense of responsibility, I end up doing the assignments myself to ensure we have something to show.

Here's where things got messy: Last week, a major conflict erupted when Mike (finally) began working on a part of the project and introduced ideas that completely contradicted what we had initially agreed upon. We had only discussed our project direction during the initial theme selection and since I had completed most of the work, it was mainly aligned with my vision. The discussion heated up and I admit, I lost my temper a bit, which I later apologized for. But Mike, and his girlfriend (also in the group), who immediately sided with him, did not apologize, exacerbating the tension.

This morning, Mike inquired if the documents on OneDrive were current. I realized my document hadn’t synced properly and merged the versions, archived the old one, and updated the main folder. Then, I received angry messages accusing me of deleting work because an Excel sheet appeared empty, so I deleted it unknowingly. I restored it and apologized, but the tension had already mounted.

Mike then sent a voice message, loudly blaming me for poor group dynamics and accusing me of handling everything alone arrogantly. He claimed I should have asked for help more, although I feel I’ve been left to manage most things myself because no one else takes the initiative.

My opinion: I'm not their mother, and I shouldn't have to constantly chase after them to contribute. Everyone knew the professor expected weekly updates, yet there was hardly any effort from them to communicate in our group chat or stay after class to discuss further—this happened only once. When I explained my point of view, Mike accused me of claiming they did nothing, which I never told. Even though I had made it clear in a detailed chart I created, which outlined who did what for each assignment.

He later accused me of complaining, though I would have remained quiet if he hadn’t provoked the discussion. I also expressed to Mike that managing the bulk of the workload wasn't my choice and that I too have a personal life. However, my efforts to explain were dismissed.

Yes but the thing is I used to invite her when we were younger. 

My best friend and I met in the 5th grade but then I moved schools next year, we still texted but we never hung out in person outside of when we went to the same school together until the 7th grade, I invited her to my 13th and my 14th birthday and oml was she a pain. 

My best friend is autistic so sometimes she kind of has trouble expressing her emotions. She'd always breakdown or call her mom when she didn't get her way, sometimes she'd call her mom when we were doing something she didn't want to do or when she felt left out when me and my other friends talk about a topic she doesn't know/care about (keep in mind she also talks about things that I don't know or care about too in her birthday parties with her other friends but I don't say anything) (Also she doesn't tell us when she feels left out, etc...), she'd keep me all to herself and not let me hang out with the other guests, one time we had to delay blowing out the candles (on an ice cream cake in a hot Texas Summer nonetheless) just because she was mad that I didn't want to play a game she did, I try to ask what's wrong and be there for her and try to include her in more things (even building a pillow fortress for her) of course but you can see how it can be a little annoying. 

After that I stopped inviting her to my birthday parties but I always felt like a bad friend, my mom recently asked if I was inviting her to my 18th birthday and I told her I wasn't and she called me a bad friend and saying how I didn't care about her, I tried to tell her that I did and told her why I stopped inviting her but she told me if I was really her friend that I would endure.

Edit: Thank you for people's feedback but I should clarify things, yes, she likes parties, even throwing some herself, yes, I did try to include her and never downright exclude her from the whole thing and when I feel like I am (she never tells me) I try my best to make her feel as included as possible, I did talk to her about hanging out with the other guests but she never listens and/or wants me all to herself, I care for her and enjoy her company but I want her to be happy (thinking of having a separate party), I'm even inviting her to my graduation, also just as she is autistic, I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder (not an excuse just a fact) so I tend to try to avoid conflict because it kind of triggers them so that can be another reason that I forgot to bring up.

She'd always breakdown or call her mom when she didn't get her way, sometimes she'd call her mom when we were doing something she didn't want to do or when she felt left out when me and my other friends talk about a topic she doesn't know/care about (keep in mind she also talks about things that I don't know or care about too in her birthday parties with her other friends but I don't say anything) (Also she doesn't tell us when she feels left out, etc...), she'd keep me all to herself and not let me hang out with the other guests, one time we had to delay blowing out the candles (on an ice cream cake in a hot Texas Summer nonetheless) just because she was mad that I didn't want to play a game she did, I try to ask what's wrong and be there for her and try to include her in more things (even building a pillow fortress for her) of course but you can see how it can be a little annoying. 

After that I stopped inviting her to my birthday parties but I always felt like a bad friend, my mom recently asked if I was inviting her to my 18th birthday and I told her I wasn't and she called me a bad friend and saying how I didn't care about her, I tried to tell her that I did and told her why I stopped inviting her but she told me if I was really her friend that I would endure.

Edit: Thank you for people's feedback but I should clarify things, yes, she likes parties, even throwing some herself, yes, I did try to include her and never downright exclude her from the whole thing and when I feel like I am (she never tells me) I try my best to make her feel as included as possible, I did talk to her about hanging out with the other guests but she never listens and/or wants me all to herself, I care for her and enjoy her company but I want her to be happy (thinking of having a separate party), I'm even inviting her to my graduation, also just as she is autistic, I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder (not an excuse just a fact) so I tend to try to avoid conflict because it kind of triggers them so that can be another reason that I forgot to bring up.

40,1cv818e,AITA For Not Including Boyfriend in Mother’s Day Gift?,"I special-ordered a gift for my step-mom on Mother’s Day. 

It was a custom family display that showed eight people and their first names, all under the family’s last name (e.g. “The Smith Family”). It lights up too. It’s kind of adorable. 

There was only room for a maximum of eight people on the display. I listed my father, my step-mom, my sister, me, my wife, and our three children. 

When I told my step-mom when to expect delivery, she said she was, “So excited!” Two days after delivery, there was no response. I texted my dad to ask if it was received. “Well...it's very nice, but someone is missing.” 

The missing person was my sister’s boyfriend. They’ve been together just over three years. Still just her boyfriend. My sister is my dad and stepmom’s daughter. 

“Is that why we didn’t hear back from her (my step-mom)?” I asked. 

“Absolutely. It's not something we can display,” my father responded. 

I told my dad that while it’s nice they consider my sister’s boyfriend to be family, they’re not married and they could break up tomorrow. “Then it would absolutely never be displayable,” I said. Of course, I also reminded him that I could only feature a maximum of eight people. 

Was I supposed to leave myself out of it? Perhaps cut out my youngest child? I listed the eight people who actually have the same last name; who are technically “family.”

My sister (13 years younger than me) has always taken priority no matter what. We couldn’t get together to celebrate the completion of my Master’s degree, because my sister *might* have wanted to have brunch for her birthday (she was undecided until it was too late). 

My dad asked me how I would feel if they did something similar, but left my wife out of it prior to us getting married. However, my wife and I had three children before we were finally married, so I don’t think that’s even in the same vicinity as if she had *just* been my girlfriend. 

Now, the gift, that was well-meaning and (I felt was) thoughtful, can’t be displayed because her boyfriend isn’t part of it? And I don’t get so much as a “thank you?” 

Am I the asshole for leaving the boyfriend out, when there wasn’t room for him anyway? Should I have been sensitive to this and not ordered this family gift for my step-mom?

We have been together for 6 years and are for the most part pretty happy

Thursday - friday 
Friday-Sunday
Thursday-Sunday
Friday - Sunday 
My husband and I are both always home but I do majority of the housework and cooking while looking after our toddler. 
He does a lot of studying and research and he does whatever yard, vehicle and Howe maintenance (which isn’t much by the way) 
The problem is the step kids come here and they get everything they ask for, they don’t really respect me and they have tablets and video games that they play whenever they want. 
The only chore they have is to put away laundry that I’ve already washed, folded and placed on their beds for them. 
This weekend they came here (yesterday) and his daughter had 4 days worth of clothes on her bed to put away because she brought them all back from her moms at once. The problem is that they played in her room after school, then had dinner, played video games, and she never put the clothes away, and then at bed time she just placed them on her chair and in the morning my toddler moved them into the floor because she wanted to sit there. The older one got mad because they got unfolded and stuff so I told her she should have put them away. And she got mad at me and rolled her eyes 

Besides *sometimes* putting a couple pieces of laundry away they don’t have any other chores around the house. Every time I bring it up to my husband he says we can implement more chores and then leaves it at that and it never happens. 
They only JUST started rinsing their dishes after meals but that’s it.

42,1cv7p0d,AITA For refusing to draw my nieces artwork for an assignment/contest she had at school?,"I’m a 17 yr old female who is ok at art and or creating things so I get asked from family and others to do stuff art related for them a lot. I usually don’t mind and do it for them sometimes for money and sometimes for free so they’re pretty comfortable asking me for art favors. 

(Since I don’t want to ramble too much I’ll get to the point) My sister K (30) asked me to do my nieces J (8) artwork for her school contest so she could win. I told her no because I don’t feel comfortable being used to cheat so my niece could win a contest when she could draw something herself and it would feel more rewarding if she won that way. After that she totally blew up in my face saying that I didn’t want to do it because I hated her kid and that since I’m her auntie I should just do it. 

A little context before I show why you might think I’m an asshole: I love my niece but her mom hands everything to her on a silver platter. She could ask for the clothes off some girls back and her mom would give it to her. Now because of this I have gotten into lots of verbal arguments with her mom about how spoiled she was and how her mom just pretends not to see it so ever since then she’s just concluded that since I “didn’t have as much stuff as her” I was jealous and hated her kid. 

Because of all of this I still refused regardless of what she said and I told her “The world isn’t fair and she has to learn that. If she doesn’t win this art contest  it won’t be the end of the world she’ll be fine” She flipped out some more and then told my mom who flipped out EVEN HARDER. I was called selfish and weird but imo they’re the ones who asked me so I have a right to refuse. 

I know depending on who reads this I’m gonna sound like someone who just needs to suck it up but I swear it goes much deeper than this post.

43,1cv7ndo,AITA for refusing to talk to/ignoring my mother and telling her I will leave home forever as soon as I get in university?,"Me (17F), my dad (49M) and my mom (50F) live together.

I will enter one of the most important exams in my life in three weeks. I am anxious but I try to keep calm. However my mom is making this very difficult for me. This is the national university admissions test I will be entering. I am a sciences and mathemathics student with good grades. But my mom isn't content.

Yesterday, I got accepted from an university in New Zealand with my own efforts. After learning this, I shared the news with my mom. For me, getting into a university from a system that I didn't even prepare for is insane! But she started screaming at me. She told me these: ""Do you really hate me that much that you applied to these places? You want to go far away? Guess what? Love is always conditional. Once you turn 18 then, bye sweetie, you are out."" I recorded the things she said just in case.

This morning, one of my advisors from my cram school called my mom to ask how I am doing, informing her about the changes made in the schedule of there. There was a review class I decided not to attend, I know the topics very well. I made this decision on my own and didn't inform her. She screamed at me again today, for not informing her. Supposedly, I needed to inform her about this as I am not an adult yet. We had a fight again. I told her she always tries to be the victim and I am tired of her behaviour. Then, I asked dad for help. He told me it is just fine, I should just say okay and not pay attention to her. I didn't think it is fine. I also told him how my mom threatened to throw me out and he didn't believe me. I showed him the record and he told me ""Eh, she is just like that sometimes. I'm sure she didn't mean that, she loves you.""

For the rest of the day, she kept storming into my room telling me how far I am from where I should be now (which I know is very wrong. I try my best NO MATTER what and that's why I came so far in first place). Finally I stared at her, locking my room immediately. I kept it locked. For dinner I went to the kitchen, this time both my parents stated their distaste for my current state in academics (with my mom in an agressive manner and my dad being passive). I told them I will never be grateful for this, how I wanted their support for once and told them I will leave home immediately and never return after getting accepted to an university. My mother told me I am a horrible daughter and how other's children are amazing. I looked at my dad for help and he apologetically stared, then left.

This much pressure with 21 days is insane even for someone resilient like me. I am not able to understand whether this behaviour is okay or not, and all of this ""freezed"" my study efforts today. I have assigments and lectures for tomorrow. I am still confused if I did what is right.

AITA? Please tell me what you think. I need to hear someone's opinion. Thank you.

Edit: I gathered the important documents needed and will calculate my finances. I also arranged a safe place, I'll stay with one of my best friends if things go real bad someday.

46,1cv7byj,AITA for not telling my mom that my dad is dead,"I (13M) feel like I should probably give some context before I start otherwise this post is just gonna sound weird. My parents divorced 4 years ago and they hate each other like in the whole 4 years they’ve barely spoke, they can’t really be in the same room without fighting. My dad also has a partner who he’s been with for 2 years. My mom and her like never speak because they also hate each other because my mom thinks that my dad cheated on her with his current partner idk if that’s true but I don’t really care. 

Anyways yeah so my dad died just over a week ago so yeah that happened. I didn’t tell my mom because I didn’t really know what to say and like I didn’t know how she was gonna react. My dad’s partner didn’t tell her earlier because she probably assumed I already told her. She picked me up the day before the funeral because I was gonna stay over so It’ll be easier for me to get to the funeral. Anyways yeah so she came inside and like asked my mom how I was like dealing with all this or something like that and obviously my mom freaked out because she didn’t know that he died. She asked me what the fuck is wrong with me and we got into an argument. I tried to explain that I didn’t know how to tell her and like I didn’t want to upset. She told me that she wished I was never born and she said all that other generic parent stuff like being disappointed and whatever. I didn’t say anything until she started shit talking my dad I told her to shut the fuck up. As I was leaving she said some shit about me liking my dads gf more than her, which literally isn’t true I don’t really like dads gf but her partner has just died so I should probably be there for her. My mom also told me to stay at dads place since I hate her apparently.

Like why do we have to talk about him so much can’t we just like move on now that funerals over and not think about him again.

My parents divorced 4 years ago and they hate each other like in the whole 4 years they’ve barely spoke, they can’t really be in the same room without fighting. My dad also has a partner who he’s been with for 2 years. My mom and her like never speak because they also hate each other because my mom thinks that my dad cheated on her with his current partner idk if that’s true but I don’t really care. 

Anyways yeah so my dad died just over a week ago so yeah that happened. I didn’t tell my mom because I didn’t really know what to say and like I didn’t know how she was gonna react. My dad’s partner didn’t tell her earlier because she probably assumed I already told her. She picked me up the day before the funeral because I was gonna stay over so It’ll be easier for me to get to the funeral. Anyways yeah so she came inside and like asked my mom how I was like dealing with all this or something like that and obviously my mom freaked out because she didn’t know that he died. She asked me what the fuck is wrong with me and we got into an argument. I tried to explain that I didn’t know how to tell her and like I didn’t want to upset. She told me that she wished I was never born and she said all that other generic parent stuff like being disappointed and whatever. I didn’t say anything until she started shit talking my dad I told her to shut the fuck up. As I was leaving she said some shit about me liking my dads gf more than her, which literally isn’t true I don’t really like dads gf but her partner has just died so I should probably be there for her. My mom also told me to stay at dads place since I hate her apparently.

47,1cv77yp,AITA for barring an acquaintance from my house after he eats most of the pizza I ordered and was ungrateful for it?,"A couple of weeks ago, I had an acquaintance over for movies and pizza, a nice sober night of fellowship.  I ordered two pizzas because I assumed I would have leftovers for the next couple of days, but this guy ate most of those two pizzas.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if I could order pizza from somewhere else next time because he did not like the crust.

I told him to fuck off and go home at that point, and that he really should have thanked me for feeding him that much pizza instead.

Now he decided to respond to that by going to a bar and drinking and saying I drove him to break his AA sobriety.

WTF is this?  Logically I know that’s on him, but emotionally I feel the need to take full responsibility over a newbie in AA going back to drinking.

Perhaps I was too hard on him.

EDIT - if he ate all the pizza, and thanked me for it, I would not be annoyed by this at all, frankly.

49,1cv6zsw,WIBTA - being furious with Husband who stayed on the sofa instead of coming with me to take our dog to the emergency vet,"Our dog had cataract surgery a couple months ago. She developed an ulcer about a month later that was very quickly quite serious and has since healed. 

Yesterday evening she started showing signs of discomfort in the other eye. I mentioned that I thought we might want to go to the Emergency Vet where they did the surgery (about a 45 minute drive) hours in advance. I had to work for a while but was able to leave early to come home and take her. At this point it was clear something was wrong with the eye. I had expected him to come with me, and explicitly said I was barely holding it together and would appreciate his support and a sense of urgency. 

He said he didn’t really want to go. I would have burst into tears trying to argue so I said nothing as I was clearly going to have to be the one who drove and needed to keep it together. I checked one last time before leaving if he was coming, to which he replied “I’d rather not if it’s okay,” and I said “it’s probably not but I don’t have it in me to argue with you about it,” and he ended things with “drive safe.” 

For context, while I had to work, it is his weekend so he didn’t have anything he had to attend to, it seemed more like he just wanted to stay comfy at home. While I managed to get us there myself, I am so hurt and angry that he couldn’t be bothered to come with me while I am clearly in distress and our dog, who is like our baby, or mine I guess, is in discomfort and there could be something jeopardizing the healing we spent months and thousands of dollars to achieve. WIBTA for ripping him a new one and expecting a meaningful apology and perhaps explanation if I’m missing anything to the story?

Still, they storm out and blast all the rest of the family a dramatised version of the story, and now I have over 150 messages from family members I don't even talk to, telling me that I shouldn't shove the community in everyone's face all the time. I added a few pride flags and had a rainbow cake because my nephew wanted it, is that so bad?

57,1cv5rc1,AITA for Refusing to be a pallbearer in my aunt’s funeral,"Hello, I’m currently stuck in a bit of a moral dilemma. Let me preface this by saying I’m not like this with everyone, only the person in question. I (27M) recently found out that my aunt (70ishF) is dying of cancer and has it written down that I am to be one of her pallbearers. 

Here’s where the question comes, this aunt in particular has been nothing but a complete bitch to me for most of my life. She constantly gave me death/go to hell glares for as long as I can remember, constantly overshadowed my accomplishments with another one of my cousin’s accomplishments, would scream and yell at me when I was 10 because I was crying during a storm (that’s a whole other issues, let’s just say there was a tornado involved). 

However one of the worst comes from when I was 6 it was the first time I had been left alone with her and my Grandmother, when my grandmother left the room to go feed her dog outside she walked over and grabbed me “Your Mom and Dad must be thrilled to have a break from your whiny ass, I want my mama I want my dad, they aren’t coming until Sunday now shut up. They would be a lot happier if your dead sibling was born and you were the miscarriage.” It was no secret to me that had happened, my parents were very open with me about it when i asked why I didn’t have a brother or sister. Now I never told them any of that happened because both my parents would have “taken care” of her on the spot, she knew my dad had a temper when it came to his son and i didn’t want that on my conscience because some people in my family would say it was just my imagination when she knows she said it. 

Flash forward to present day, my mom tells me that she has put me down to be a pallbearer and I immediately refuse. She says I need to forgive and forget 20 years of mistreatment from her to which I told her I would do no such thing, maybe forgive but never forget. This whole thing between how I act when she’s brought up is driving a wedge between me and my mom. Saying if I don’t do this then she’s not going to the funeral and I can deal with the fallout from her side of my family which knows we are not and have never been on the best of terms. 

Now here’s where I may be the asshole, my mom who is a wonderful mom constantly wants me to go with her every weekend over there to which I have said I do not want to spend every Saturday/Sunday over there when I have my own life and I would rather this aunt be as far away from it as possible. If she wants to go over there then she can go by herself. I truly hate making her upset but I have my own life and friends that I would much rather spend my weekends with. 

TLDR: My Aunt who’s dying of cancer wants me to be a pallbearer in her funeral. I have reasons for not wanting to have any part with it due to past verbally and emotionally abusive experience with her for the past 20 years and it’s causing a wedge between me and my mother.

58,1cv5hbb,AITA for going skinny dipping while travelling?,"Made this as a throwaway account because people in my personal life follow my Reddit.

By way of background, I (F21) am currently travelling around Europe with my boyfriend, Jack (22), and three of our friends: Adam (M21), Lacey (F20) and Charlie (M21). Adam and Lacey are also a couple, while Charlie is single.

We've been travelling for around two weeks now and it's been an amazing trip; there's been no arguments and we're making some memories I'll have forever. 

We're currently in Croatia and were at a secluded little beach/cove, when Adam mentioned going skinny dipping. We'd have a few drinks at this stage and it honestly sounded like a lot of fun/one of the bucket list things. Adam, Lacey, and Charlie started to get undressed and I was about to start until I noticed that Jack wasn't really engaged. I asked him what was up, and he said he wasn't comfortable with going skinny dipping, and I shouldn't join in either. I told him I didn't want to miss out on the fun and there was nothing weird about it, so started to take off my top and skirt. Before I went to unclasp my bra, he mentioned how it was beyond disrespectful; I said that Adam wasn't acting like this, nor was Lacey, and there was nothing sexual about it. I took my bra off but keep my thong on to try and appease him/as a compromise, before running into the sea.

We had a great time, and it was about 15 minutes of splashing and fun memories. When we got out and were drying, Jack was still distant and wasn't engaging. Everyone could sense the mood was a bit off, but I figured it was tiredness. 

When we got back to the hostel later on, I tried to see if Jack was fine, but he got annoyed and said how I'd disrespected him by skinny dipping and ""getting my tits out"" in front of two guys. I was taken aback because Adam is with Lacey and Charlie wasn't staring; besides, we were mostly covered by water so barely anything was visible. I told him he was being insecure and paranoid, and I had done nothing wrong. 

He maintained that I was disrespectful and nudity is sexual regardless of my intentions. He said he had respected me, but I just think he's massively overblowing this; I shouldn't have to compromise on my fun because of his insecurities.

Later when we went out she lied and told me she has to give her friend something and to wait her by the park where my friend from the other city  said to wait her by, we went to the store before the park and there she was with her boyfriend, i knew this would happen but it still hurts me. She comes to the park 20 minutes later and literally grabs my friend who just came and threw her over her shoulder and started walking away before she even got to hug me. The whole time they were 3 meters away from us( there were 5 of us including me) and i was walking alone behind everyone. When we got to the beach they were filming tiktok’s until Luna got a message from her boyfriend and she just said “my boyfriend is waiting for me he’s at my house and he 100% told my mom i went out at 4am last night, i have to go”, of course she went at 4am out with her friends but i know he would never tell her mom that because he knows she will be grounded.

62,1cv54er,AITA for refusing to pay for birthday presents for my son that he can only use at my ex-wife's place?,"I am a 52m recently separated from my ex (49f) of 18 yrs. We share custody (week on, week off) with our 2 children, a 13 yr old daughter and soon-to-be 15 yr old son.

The relationship ended mostly amicably, noone cheated on each other, as far as I know. Just drifted apart, 'friend-zoned'. When we split we agreed that I would stay in our old 4-bdrm family home for a few more years, while our kids were still at high school (we lived right next door to my son’s high school). I would continue to pay down our mortgage (on my own) and also pay for any additional renovations (on my own) that we still have left to complete, since buying the place 4 yrs ago. When the time comes to sell she will get her 50%.

She agreed to move out into her own 3-bdrm rental out by the beach. I am paying her child support, as she only earns about 1/3 of what I do in her part time (30hrs/wk) job. The rest of her income comes from Govt social support. We have a joint bank account where we both put money into to cover the kids general needs.

This week is my son's 15th birthday, he's big into gaming, basketball and fishing. When he moves between our two places he's brings his Xbox with him. I have paid for two computer monitors, one at each property, just so he can do this easily and be happy. He has a home-made basketball hoop (that he helped me build & paint for him when he was a young 10 year old lad) mounted on the outside of my house for him to practice, whenever he stays with me.

My ex emailed me to ask me what I think 'we' should get him for his birthday, i.e. share costs for. She listed two things, firstly a free-standing basketball hoop, and a gaming chair (all up around $1000 total), both to be used only at her place, for his enjoyment there.

I've refused to help her buy these particular options, I'd prefer it if we spent our money on something that he'll enjoy getting the benefits from wherever he may be. Like new clothes, a new device, a new bike, fishing gear etc, or a shared family experience with both of us present. I thought that was reasonable.

My ex-wife thinks I'm being a jerk with this stance, for not agreeing to pay anything for these particular presents, to help furnish her house or his bedroom there. She's suggesting that it's not fair that he can play basketball at my place and not hers, or that he feels more comfortable playing video games at my place, and not hers. She’s now accusing me of starting to play some kind petty 'tit-for-tat' game with her, by ‘not fairly contributing enough towards my son's happiness on his birthday’.

My fear is that I am indeed being unnecessarily picky with this battle, being too selfish, and denying her the right to be able to make her home as happy or as comfortable as mine, for my son to live in.

64,1cv4vod,AITA for not wearing makeup?,"I (23F) live with 3 girls all 20s. We've lived together \~6 months. I knew 2 of them before and met the 3rd girl 'Jane' when we moved in. Jane and I previously got along. I wouldn't say we were friends as we don't have much in common but she's a good housemate.

We went out last weekend for one of the other girls birthday. It wasn't a big thing, just going to a bar with some friends. We were all getting ready together and here's where the problems started. I don't wear makeup so it doesn't take me long to get ready. I was just sitting and chatting while the others got ready. Jane kept making comments about my outfit/hair etc. I didn't think anything of it and thought she was asking if I was ready so I said I was. Then she looked me up and down and said wow it must be so nice to not care about how you look. I was taken aback because that's pretty rude, and I wasn't wearing a dress but I was wearing an outfit that was appropriate for where we were going. I didn't want to start an argument so I jokingly said: well you know, I'm not the one who has to look at me so it's not my problem. I often say this when people ask about me not wearing makeup and most people just laugh and move on. She scoffed, rolled her eyes and didn't say anything else but for the rest of the evening she didn't acknowledge me at all. I thought maybe she'd just had a bad day but she was really cold for days to the point where my other 2 housemates asked what was up.

I decided to ask her if I'd done something to upset her and she absolutely exploded at me.

I was shocked and just laughed. For context:

1. I was a tomboy so I never learned how to do makeup. I've let my friends do my makeup a few times but I don't like how it looks on me. I feel uncomfortable and self-conscious so I just prefer not to wear it. It's got nothing to do with hating femininity

1. I don't look/dress feminine but I do lots of things that are traditionally feminine. I'm not sure why Jane thinks I hate feminine things other than that I look more androgynous

1. I am a lesbian! No-one's accused me of trying to get male attention before which is why I laughed. In her defence, I'm not sure she knows since I never 'came out' to her but it's not a secret and I don't think I'm particularly subtle.

I tried to apologise and explain, but she said she didn't want to hear excuses and accused me of gaslighting her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for not wearing makeup? I (23F) live with 3 girls all 20s. We've lived together \~6 months. I knew 2 of them before and met the 3rd girl 'Jane' when we moved in. Jane and I previously got along. I wouldn't say we were friends as we don't have much in common but she's a good housemate.

We went out last weekend for one of the other girls birthday. It wasn't a big thing, just going to a bar with some friends. We were all getting ready together and here's where the problems started. I don't wear makeup so it doesn't take me long to get ready. I was just sitting and chatting while the others got ready. Jane kept making comments about my outfit/hair etc. I didn't think anything of it and thought she was asking if I was ready so I said I was. Then she looked me up and down and said wow it must be so nice to not care about how you look. I was taken aback because that's pretty rude, and I wasn't wearing a dress but I was wearing an outfit that was appropriate for where we were going. I didn't want to start an argument so I jokingly said: well you know, I'm not the one who has to look at me so it's not my problem. I often say this when people ask about me not wearing makeup and most people just laugh and move on. She scoffed, rolled her eyes and didn't say anything else but for the rest of the evening she didn't acknowledge me at all. I thought maybe she'd just had a bad day but she was really cold for days to the point where my other 2 housemates asked what was up.

I decided to ask her if I'd done something to upset her and she absolutely exploded at me.

65,1cv4m1h,AITA for threatening to kick out my niece after she hacked my daughter’s Roblox account?,"My (38F) daughter (13F) has been playing this game called Roblox since lockdown first started as a way of playing with her friends virtually as well as curing her boredom. She was obsessed with this Roblox game that’s set in a school because she missed her friends so much and it allowed her to stay connected with them. Her interest in video games has developed into an interest into technology - she’s by far at the top of her IT class and has even started learning how to code in order to make her own game.

My sister (34F) and niece (10F) have recently had to move in with us after my sister discovered that her husband was having an affair. They’re staying at my house for the time being while she saves up money for a place of their own.

My niece and daughter usually get along, and they both bond over their interest in Roblox. Last week, my daughter was completely distraught and crying nonstop. She said that she saw her cousin playing on a Roblox game and realised her cousin’s avatar had a lot more items than usual. She decided to join her, only to realise that her account had been hacked and she’d lost nearly every item she had on her favourite Roblox game. She’d lost 800K of the in-game currency and nearly her entire inventory, which she claimed was worth over 5 million of the in-game currency. She had spent the last four years saving up for those items and everything was gone just like that.

My daughter began accusing my niece of hacking her account. My niece denied it at first, but quickly broke under pressure and admitted everything. The previous day, they had been playing the game together when I called them down to dinner. My niece has only been playing for a few months and I suppose she would be considered a ‘noob’. She begged my daughter to give her some of her items, and my daughter refused, saying that she should earn the items by herself. When my daughter came down, my niece decided to stay behind for a minute to transfer all of my daughter’s items into her account.

I tried to mediate the situation, but my sister is refusing to co-operate. She told me that it’s only a game, it’s not like my daughter spent real money on it. I attempted to explain just how much this game means to my daughter, to which my sister said that my daughter should count herself lucky that her biggest problem is a bunch of pixels on a screen. She said my daughter was a teenager now and was too old to be acting this immature over a game. My niece refuses to give my niece her stuff back and says it’s unfair that my daughter gets to have everything she wants both in real life and online. I told my sister and niece that both of them were acting like ungrateful brats considering how I was letting them stay in my home rent free.

Today, I gave her an ultimatum: if my niece doesn’t return everything she hacked from my daughter, they would both have one week to leave.

66,1cv4iag,AITA for not forcing my child to eat blueberries?,"Today my wife gave our 11 year old son some blueberries. My son said that he rather not eat them because he doesn't really like blueberries. My wife replied ""but these are really good"" so my son hesitantly tried one blueberry and replied ""Thx, but I still don't like them and rather not eat the rest"". I thought that was the end of it and went to the store to get groceries for diner.

When i came back my son was crying at the table because he was forced to eat the remaining three blueberries. I asked my wife ""why is he crying?"" and she explained that he had to eat the blueberries because it is healthy. Thinking it was just about eating a piece of fruit i told my son that he didn't have to eat the blueberries but he did have to eat another piece of fruit instead like an apple or three strawberries or something similar. My son immediatly agreed, spat out the blueberries (in the garbage can) and started eating an apple.

This, much to my wives dismay. She said i overruled her authority and that my son will never learn to eat healthy. My reply was that it is not ok to force a child (or any other person) to eat something they don't like (especially after they tasted it). How would she feel if I forced her to eat something she doens't like? Why is it ok for her to not eat certain foods but not for our son? He likes enough vegetables and fruit in order to get a balanced diet so I think we should meet him halfway and not focus on forcing him to eat stuff we know he doesn't like (and he is not really a fussy eater so we have plenty of healthy stuff to choose from).

The situation escalated and at one point my son even said ""i'll just eat the blueberries"", in an attempt to de-escalate our argument (after which he took three blueberries from the fridge and swallowing them almost whole just to get it over with). Sadly for him, it didn't really work because we were already to far into the argument (although i did thank him afterwards for trying and apoligized for not being able to let it slide).

Am i the asshole because I didn't force my son to eat the blueberries and allowed him to take another piece of fruit he does like?

  
Edit : I wasn't expecting such a big response and haven't been able to read all comments. Thanks to everyone who responded, i really appreciate the advice. Maybe i'm not the AH in this situation but in the future I will try not to argue with my wife in front of our son. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for not forcing my child to eat blueberries?

68,1cv3rrl,WIBTA If I leave a dance club two weeks before our big performance?,"For context, I (f30) have been a part of this club for just under a year. I tried getting back into dance lessons for fitness and as part of my weight loss journey - keep these in mind, I am overweight, and I was looking for lessons, nothing more. 

I have a family member who is part of this dance club, and after seeing their performance last year I was inspired to join their club. First six months last year were ok - I danced as a kid, so I have coordination and some basic dance understanding, but I’d lost much of my balance and technique. The biggest difference I noticed, was that this clubs style is very … freestyle/hiphop, not classical dance style that I remember learning, so I have been out of my depth since day one. The classes weren’t lessons, just learning choreography, which I didn’t mind, because I was excited to learn a new dance style … even if no one really ever acknowledged me.

I never received any feedback or guidance from anyone, just some alterations to a move so I can blend in on stage, or vague “Don’t worry, you’ll get it” or “Keep working, you’re doing great” comments. I worked my butt off to learn the routines, and no one had noticed, or if they did, they didn’t say anything. During the end of year performance I was stressed and anxious because I didn’t know what to expect, how to do my hair or makeup or what/how to prep for the concert. When I asked for help in the group chat one person responded and said they’ll help me on the day - which she did, a little, but I felt so awkward needing to approach her and ask for help, while the rest of her group kept glaring at me for, I assume, being in “their” dressing room.

Fast forward to this year, I’ve been working really hard, going to extra classes when they’re offered, practicing at home, basically doing everything I can to be the best I can. All but maybe 3-4 girls (out of 20 or so), including my family member, have been cold or indifferent to me. A few girls are yet to purposely make eye contact with me. 

One of the girls who I’d been getting along with was bullied into leaving, and hearing about her leaving from my family member - who was laughing about it - was my lightbulb moment. I’d been ignoring a lot of similar red flags up until then.

I no longer find any form of joy in going to rehearsal, and every time I think about having to go, or the big mid year performance, I get frustrated and have a panic attack. 

The big performance is in two weeks, and it’s something like an 8 hour day for 4 minutes of me being on stage with the others, and then ignored/bored the rest of the day, if not receiving subtle, rude comments for asking for makeup help (I’m not a makeup girly, let alone stage makeup). 

My concern is my family member, if I quit then half the family will know I quit and I don’t want to deal with that gossip and BS for the foreseeable future. I’m seriously considering faking an injury to get out of it, to have a “legitimate” reason to back out.

70,1cv3jni,AITA for not accepting my families help,"For context I’m 18(M) and I’m moving out of the house next week, and planning on going to community college at the moment.

I’m just going to get straight to the point, My grandma has a college fund for me and I’m using it minimally just for community college. I’ve always wanted to live my life independently for better or for worse, because I feel like down the road I will feel more gratified knowing I achieved success on a relatively independent basis. Additionally, the path I’m taking in life does not need a degree or anything so I didn’t see too much benefit in even going to a 4 year college. The problem is, I can technically use this money to pay for my rent and a new laptop etc. since it is categorized under “educational” expenses, but I said that I’m not going to. Working to pay for these things myself, while undoubtedly harder, will bring me more pride and a feeling of self accomplishment. My whole family seems to disagree and my grandma especially thinks I’m squandering my resources.

But onto the part that’s bothering me the most. I understand this might seem frivolous and out of touch but I gotta say it somewhere. My grandma as a graduation gift wanted to start an IRA for me and put 6500 a year into it instead of leaving anything for me when she passes away. While this is extremely generous of her, and I’ve expressed my gratitude for this offer, I told her I can’t take it because it goes against how I want to live my life. I told her her emotional and financial support through my formative years was plenty and that I’m already forever in debt to her so I’d feel ashamed to take more. She is not budging on the subject and it is making me feel incredibly guilty. I know she’s doing this out of a place of love and wants to leave me with a good retirement, but I don’t want that part of my life to be handed to me, I want to earn it. It also doesn’t help that this is pretty much her replacement for her will to me.

Onto the last part. My dad, while not quite rich yet, is certainly on the path to becoming wealthy within the next 5-10 years due to his business doing very well. My mom wants me to inherit this business down the line for nothing other than financial reasons. Of course, my dad would make me prove myself and it would probably be 10 years at least in the company before I was making good money. I have 0 interest in this. I’m trying to become a musician, and while it’s obviously a far fetched goal, I’d rather be lower class doing what I love than rich and hating my life. My mom thinks I’m
being stupid.

But onto the part that’s bothering me the most. I understand this might seem frivolous and out of touch but I gotta say it somewhere. My grandma as a graduation gift wanted to start an IRA for me and put 6500 a year into it instead of leaving anything for me when she passes away. While this is extremely generous of her, and I’ve expressed my gratitude for this offer, I told her I can’t take it because it goes against how I want to live my life. I told her her emotional and financial support through my formative years was plenty and that I’m already forever in debt to her so I’d feel ashamed to take more. She is not budging on the subject and it is making me feel incredibly guilty. I know she’s doing this out of a place of love and wants to leave me with a good retirement, but I don’t want that part of my life to be handed to me, I want to earn it. It also doesn’t help that this is pretty much her replacement for her will to me.

Onto the last part. My dad, while not quite rich yet, is certainly on the path to becoming wealthy within the next 5-10 years due to his business doing very well. My mom wants me to inherit this business down the line for nothing other than financial reasons. Of course, my dad would make me prove myself and it would probably be 10 years at least in the company before I was making good money. I have 0 interest in this. I’m trying to become a musician, and while it’s obviously a far fetched goal, I’d rather be lower class doing what I love than rich and hating my life. My mom thinks I’m
being stupid.

This all brings a lot of guilt into my life. Even more so then that, it makes me feel like a fraud knowing that even if I become successful independently, I could have taken these handouts anyways which mentally negates anything I achieve for myself financially.",1.0,0.11135083436965942,0,0
71,1cv3h0x,AITA for telling my mom I won't pay rent AND do chores to live with them?,"Hello! I'm 24(f) and I live with my parents currently. I'm doing this to save money and they haven't charged me rent until now.
I've been basically ""paying"" rent by doing the chores, mainly cleaning the house, groceries shopping, managing their bills, cooking their meals and taking care of my 5(f) cousin(due to some circumstances my parents are currently her guardians) when I'm off work.

This hasn't left me with that much free time however it's been in fact helping me save money so I've been more than happy with this arrangement. 

Recently however my parents have asked me to start paying rent. I asked them if everything was ok and if they're struggling but they told that's not the case and they just feel like I should contribute more since they've been letting me stay with them for free after finishing college. I'm not gonna lie I was a bit bumped but the rent they wanted from me was still a way better deal than anything else i would find somewhere else so I accepted. 

A few hours ago however my mom confronted me about how I've been slacking off on my chores after I told her I can't take care of my cousin since I had plans with some friends.

She said they tried to be understanding but this can't keep going on and I asked her what she meant. Since the deal was that me doing chores was going to be how I pay rent, now that I'm actually paying rent I'll stop doing them and I thought that was obvious. She got mad, called me ungrateful and spoiled. I told her she can't expect me to pay rent AND all do all these chores that left me with no free time and that I'd be better off if I just found my own place even if it was going to cost me more at this point. 

She got angry once more because I'd rather ""give money to some stranger than your own family"" and said she can't believe how big of an AH I am and to just wait until my dad hears about it.
He's gonna be back in a few hours and honestly I've been thinking about our fight, if you can even call it that, and I'm wondering if I really am entitled for how I feel?

EDIT 2: UPDATE

Some of you have been asking for an update once I have the talk with my parents so here it is.
But first of all I'd like to clear up some things.

1. English is not my first language and I suppose the use of the word ""chores"" confused some people. By chores I don't mean just washing the dishes and taking out the trash.

2. A lot of you also assumed that just because I don't think it's fair I continue cleaning their mess this means I suddenly want them to be my maid and cook and do everything for me. How y'all reached that conclusion instead of the sane one where I'd continue doing stuff for myself is beyond me but anyways.
No, I do not expect them to clean after me or cook my food or whatever, I still do those things.

3. They do not support me financially and haven't done so since I finished college 2 years ago. I pay 1 third of the bills with my own money, I buy my own groceries, whatever shared necessities( toilet paper, cleaning products etc) I also contribute to. If I want/need something I buy it myself.

4. The reason I'm still living with them is literally the beginning of the first sentence idk how so many of you could have just skipped that part.

5. Yes I am aware that once I move out I'll have to both pay rent and do chores, I've lived with roommates before and I know I'd have to share chores with them as well and tbh I preferred that compared to what my parents expected of me.

Now onto the update.
My dad came home last night a few hours after I've made that post and he told me mom informed him about our fight but he's tired and we'll talk about it in the morning. 
I was quite anxious and could barely sleep ngl. Well the morning came and we had the talk. 

My dad told me that he's discussed things with mom and he does kinda understand why I'd be unhappy with our new arrangement but that he still considers they're giving me an amazing deal. I asked, as some suggested in the comments, if they're struggling financially which he denied. Then I asked if they just want me to move out and don't know how to tell me. Once again he denied that and both of them got slightly offended(?) that I'd even suggest that. 

So yeah, they haven't given me an exact reason for their change of heart. They just think it's still a fair deal even with the added rent. I told them that I get it's their house and they can do what they want but personally I don't find it fair so I'll be trying to move out as soon as possible.

They didn't quite like that either. 😅
My mom brought up once more the fact that I'd rather make a stranger rich than contribute to our household which made me kinda mad because I think I've done my fair share of contributing to the household so far. 

She started tearing up a bit and went on a rant about how she can't believe her only child would do this to her and to at least think of my cousin. About how my cousin loves me and abandoning her would destroy her. 

My father then told me he thinks I'm irrational and that he'll allow me to calm down and rethink my decision when I'm less agitated, I was the calmest out of the 3 of us lol, because I'll see that they're right once I've thought things through.

73,1cv3e72,AITA for not telling one friend about the death of another friend's mother?,"A few weeks ago my friend Bill's mother passed away from cancer. I heard about this two days after she died, when Bill messaged me. I instantly messaged back saying I was sorry, asking if I could call him, or if there was anything at all that I could do. Bill appreciated it, though told me he didn't want to talk at that time; he has lost family members (father, brother) in the past and similarly didn't want to talk to other people immediately when they passed away. He is just the kind of person who likes to grieve alone/with family, and *then* let his friends know. It's not the way I'd do it, but it's his choice.

Accordingly, I didn't tell anyone that Bill's mother died. Eventually, Bill asks to meet up for a drink, to which I agree. I was supposed to meet up with another friend, Fred that week, so I asked Bill if Fred could join us (we are all friends since school). Bill agrees, so I invite Fred. In order to prepare him for the situation, I told Fred about the loss, and not to expect a ""fun"" night; rather, we will be there to support Bill. When it came up that I had known about the loss for 9 days, Fred immediately got confrontational over text, saying I should have told him sooner. I explained that Bill is extremely private, but Fred wouldn't let it go, saying that I (i) let Fred down for not telling him, and (ii) let Bill down by not telling people, as allegedly, Bill *clearly* told me so that I could tell other people in his stead.

When I contested this, pointing to how Bill has acted in similar situations in the past, Fred said I was ""completely unhinged"", and that if I asked anyone, they would agree. I said that Bill does things the way he does, and he's the person who counts here, not me, or Fred, or anyone else. Fred's implication that I let Bill down by not telling people so they could comfort him has caused me a huge amount of upset (I absolutely love Bill, he is my best friend, and I'm heartbroken that he lost his mother, and Fred is treating me like I betrayed Bill). Throughout this I apologised to Fred for him being hurt by me not telling him, but I said I did what I felt was right, as I respected Bill's (admittedly, assumed) wishes. When I told him that his allegations of letting Bill down were causing me extreme hurt too, and asked for a return apology for that, he ignored it completely.

Fred's mother died of cancer several years ago, and he had told Bill that he would spend more time with him in solidarity; this didn't happen. So I think Fred is guilty about this, and trying to shift some blame to me. I also think Fred is indignant that Bill told me and not him. In any case, I don't feel like I did anything wrong.

74,1cv3dsm,AITA for refusing to lend money to my unreliable friend to save his dog?,"I'm facing a moral dilemma and could really use some advice. My friend let's call him Alex recently reached out to me in desperation. His lovely dog has been diagnosed with cancer, and the only option for treatment is an expensive surgery that Alex can't afford on his own.

Now, I'm fortunate enough to have some savings set aside, and I could technically help. But here's the thing: Alex has a history of being incredibly unreliable when it comes to money. He's made countless impulsive decisions in the past and hasn't always been responsible with borrowed funds.

As much as I empathize with his situation and want to help his furry companion, I can't shake the fear that lending him money would be throwing it away. I worry that I'll never see that money again, and I can't afford to take that risk, especially for such a significant amount.

However, I can't shake the guilt of potentially leaving Alex and his dog in such a dire situation. Am I the asshole for prioritizing my own financial security over potentially saving his beloved pet's life?

76,1cv3afu,AITA for expecting my sister to pay me back for damages?,"So my sister, F19, and I, F20, are pretty close  with one another, enough to go out with each other on the weekends and lending each other our things. This past weekend my sister was going out on a date and asked me to help her out and get ready. I happily obliged as I want the best for my sister and she seemed pretty excited. One of the things I did was let her borrow a pair of Converse that I admittedly don't wear too often but are fairly expensive nonetheless. 
I figured that I shouldn't be too worried because my sister takes care of things that she borrows so I could let her use some of my more expensive things as it was an expensive restaurant they were going to. As she doesn't live with me I told her to just bring the shoes back whenever she could. Well today her and her boyfriend came to return my shoes but when she returned the shoes she told me that the strap tore off of it and showed me. When I looked at it I saw that the strap hadn't been completely torn off but it was unrepairable. I looked at her bc and got mad, asking how it happened as I've had them for a bit and the strap shouldn't just tear like it did, and that it had to have been from neglect. Both her and her boyfriend denied that but didn't say a reason as to how it was almost completely torn off.

So my sister, F19, and I, F20, are pretty close  with one another, enough to go out with each other on the weekends and lending each other our things. This past weekend my sister was going out on a date and asked me to help her out and get ready. I happily obliged as I want the best for my sister and she seemed pretty excited. One of the things I did was let her borrow a pair of Converse that I admittedly don't wear too often but are fairly expensive nonetheless. 
I figured that I shouldn't be too worried because my sister takes care of things that she borrows so I could let her use some of my more expensive things as it was an expensive restaurant they were going to. As she doesn't live with me I told her to just bring the shoes back whenever she could. Well today her and her boyfriend came to return my shoes but when she returned the shoes she told me that the strap tore off of it and showed me. When I looked at it I saw that the strap hadn't been completely torn off but it was unrepairable. I looked at her bc and got mad, asking how it happened as I've had them for a bit and the strap shouldn't just tear like it did, and that it had to have been from neglect. Both her and her boyfriend denied that but didn't say a reason as to how it was almost completely torn off.

I have to say, Isabelle is fucking amazing. She drives on field trips, she does homework with the kids, she handles play dates, she's the one adult my 10 year old likes, she's not dependent on screens, does art projects with the kids, she speaks 10 year old, and she's even teaching them how to cook and bake. They made mini quiches a few weeks ago. 

My oldest is doing state testing right now and wanted a fun activity with her friends. Isabelle suggested a spa day and my daughter loved it. I set up a day for my 4 year old to go home with his grandparents and let Isabelle turn our living room into a spa. She picked up my daughter, my niece, and 2 friends, brought them to our house, and did their hair and nails while they laid back and did face masks. 

I guess my niece was telling her mom how cool Isabelle is because my SIL texted Isabelle offering her a nanny position 4 days a week, matching whatever I pay her but for only 1 kid. Isabelle showed me the text and told me that she will have to think about it because the extra money would be nice. I told her if she promised to stay, next year I'd have her at 5 days a week with a $5 per hour raise.

80,1cv1mmr,AITA for Reporting a Fellow Hostel Guest for Sneaking In a Non-Paying Friend?,"I recently stayed at a popular hostel while backpacking through Europe. The hostel had clear rules: everyone must pay for their stay, and guests are not allowed to sneak in non-paying visitors. The staff emphasized that this policy helps keep prices low and helps ensure everyone's safety.

One evening, I noticed a fellow guest, let's call her Emma, sneaking her friend into the dorm. They were giggling and trying to be discreet, but it was obvious. At first, I thought it was none of my business, but then I started to worry about the implications. What about the security risks of an unknown person being in the dorms? If she did something, the hostel would have none of her details to track her down. Also it's really just not fair. I paid full price for my bed, and yet other people can just illegally do what they want for free?

After much internal debate, I decided to report it to the front desk. The staff thanked me and handled the situation discreetly, but Emma found out it was me. She confronted me angrily, and accused me of being a snitch and ruining her friend's trip. Obviously this made me very uncomfortable, and since the confrontation I've been questioning if I was even right to say anything given how upset Emma got.

Now, I’m conflicted. I understand wanting to help a friend save money and that everyone hates snitches, but I also think rules should be respected for the benefit of everyone. I even specifically booked a small dorm room because I was nervous about staying with too many people.

Recently, my father and I returned from a trip to London, which took place from May 5th to 17th, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the tattoo shop where he works. His girlfriend couldn’t join us due to work commitments and the cost of tickets and a hotel, even though we stayed in a spare room at one of my father’s close friends' place. If she had come, we would have had to spend more money on a hotel.

We had planned to spend at least one day exploring London and informed her of our plans beforehand, though we were unsure of the exact day. She encouraged my father to find a good day for sightseeing. We chose Thursday because my father didn’t have work that day, whereas Sunday would have been difficult due to the tattoo shop anniversary party on Saturday. After our day out, I posted pictures of the places we visited. For some reason, on Friday morning, my father’s girlfriend called him, very upset, claiming we went to London without her, especially to the National Art Gallery. Even though she had encouraged my dad to go, just a few days later of phone call arguments she asked my dad for a break-up and, that we needed to move out as soon as possible.

(27m) To begin, my (24m) younger sibling and I used to grapple with our weight issues; we were quite out of shape and had reached a point where doctors were advising us to shed some pounds.

Therefore, we decided to relocate to a different state to fully commit ourselves to this goal with no distractions. Over the past three years, we have devoted ourselves to improving our health and fitness through boxing and calisthenics. We have successfully shed weight and now feel healthier and more toned.

However, a problem arose when my sister got married yesterday, and my brother returned to our hometown for the occasion. Since we are not very active on social media, it came as a surprise to them to see us, as they had not seen us for almost three years. My brother and I have thick single groomed mustaches and Afros reminiscent of Apollo Creed from the movie ""Rocky,"" a character who deeply inspired us during our boxing and fitness journey. Growing the mustache holds special significance for us, especially now that Carl Weathers, who portrayed Creed, has passed away.

My sister, disapproving of the mustaches, demanded that we shave them off before the wedding. Given the trauma she experienced in her previous relationship, where her past partner who had a mustache like us did unspeakable things to her, that I probably can’t say on here. I refused to shave my mustache. However, my younger brother complied, leading to an argument between us and the rest of the family.

84,1cv0iov,AITA for asking my sister to compensate me for fixing my laptop?,"Hey everyone, 

A couple months ago my younger sister (24) and I (26) were talking about our laptops. She has a newer laptop (Lenovo Yoga, purchased in 2022) and I have the same model but from 2017. 

At the time, she was still in the final stretch of her architectural engineering degree and was complaining frequently about how slow her laptop was. I said I would help her fix it (I work in IT and am a PC hobbyist), considering it was a newer laptop I figured it just needed a little bit of work. She said that she just wanted to make it last a few more months, but said that if I wanted to fix it, she would give it to me in exchange for my older laptop once she graduated. 

I was pretty excited about this, her laptop is a lot beefier than mine in terms of performance and my laptop is still perfectly fine for lower-end programs and browsing + it still looks very sleek/modern. Since she didn't need the extra horsepower it was a win-win. 

Well, fast forward to her graduation two weeks ago, I reminded her of our arrangement and she said she would move all her files, etc. I started the process of reconditioning my laptop. I cleaned it inside and out, purchased/installed a new battery, installed a new SSD and repasted the CPU. I also completely wiped the laptop, backed up 7 years worth of files and set it up good as new. All in all, this cost me about $100 and hours of my time. I wanted it to feel as ""new"" to her as possible. 

Today, we were supposed to exchange laptops. I texted her several times throughout the week to make sure, updated her on my progress of reconditioning my laptop. I woke up early this morning to do a couple last minute things like installing drivers and what not, then she texts me that she no longer wants to do the exchange. She said that she \*just\* realized that with her new job, she may have to work from home sometimes and run the programs on her laptop..

So, AITA for asking my sister to compensate me for fixing up my old laptop?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for asking my sister to compensate me for fixing my laptop? Hey everyone, 

A couple months ago my younger sister (24) and I (26) were talking about our laptops. She has a newer laptop (Lenovo Yoga, purchased in 2022) and I have the same model but from 2017. 

At the time, she was still in the final stretch of her architectural engineering degree and was complaining frequently about how slow her laptop was. I said I would help her fix it (I work in IT and am a PC hobbyist), considering it was a newer laptop I figured it just needed a little bit of work. She said that she just wanted to make it last a few more months, but said that if I wanted to fix it, she would give it to me in exchange for my older laptop once she graduated. 

I was pretty excited about this, her laptop is a lot beefier than mine in terms of performance and my laptop is still perfectly fine for lower-end programs and browsing + it still looks very sleek/modern. Since she didn't need the extra horsepower it was a win-win. 

Well, fast forward to her graduation two weeks ago, I reminded her of our arrangement and she said she would move all her files, etc. I started the process of reconditioning my laptop. I cleaned it inside and out, purchased/installed a new battery, installed a new SSD and repasted the CPU. I also completely wiped the laptop, backed up 7 years worth of files and set it up good as new. All in all, this cost me about $100 and hours of my time. I wanted it to feel as ""new"" to her as possible. 

Today, we were supposed to exchange laptops. I texted her several times throughout the week to make sure, updated her on my progress of reconditioning my laptop. I woke up early this morning to do a couple last minute things like installing drivers and what not, then she texts me that she no longer wants to do the exchange. She said that she \*just\* realized that with her new job, she may have to work from home sometimes and run the programs on her laptop..

I tried my best not to express any disappointment, but I did tell her it was pretty shitty to wait this long to tell me, especially since she's known about this new job for months now. She said she was really sorry and didn't know how to make it up to me, so I asked her to just Venmo me $50 to cover some of the cost of what I did to the laptop.

85,1cv0ba9,AITA for showing my Aunt the dress I was going to buy and not my Mom? ,"Hi, I’m an 18F and my prom is next week. I’m plus sized ( around 14-16 ) and I have a really hard time finding dresses that fit me cause I’m also short ( 4’11” ) ( ik obese, I don’t need no one commenting on that rn honestly) but today I had a half day of school and I went to go visit my friend. She had gotten her prom dress and I hadn’t yet. We hanged out for a while cause she was having a bad day and eventually we decided to go to the Mall and find me a dress. 

Backstory: My mother around the beginning of May tried to take me dress shopping, but that day I was feeling really insecure about myself and then she brought me there without me knowing and started making me try on dresses. I started crying and I kinda snapped at her. That’s behind and I forgave her for that, I also apologized for snapping at her. She was just trying to help. 
My aunt is like a second mother to me, she was there for basically my whole life and I trusted her a lot. Recently though she got married, moved pretty far away, and kinda ghosted me and her sister. My mom’s relationship with my aunt has gone just downhill since then and my Mom if holding a grudge but imo rightfully so. 

Back to the present: Today when I was with my friend I saw a dress that we both really liked on me. I took a picture and when I was about to send it to my mom and dad, I saw my aunt was online and sent it to her. I ended up not getting the dress since I didn’t have enough money. My aunt offered to pay but I denied cause I don’t believe in borrowing money from family. When I got home and saw my aunt was on the phone with my mom. My mom hanged up on her and started saying how I made her feel bad for showing my aunt a photo and not me, how she thinks I like my aunt more, and basically making me feel really bad, I tried apologizing but she didn’t care. My Dad overheard and he was on my side saying she was overreacting. My mom gave me a half ass apology and that just got me mad cause honestly, the whole time she was apologizing then throwing something else in there to make me feel bad. 

But now I’m think AITA, maybe I shouldn’t have shared that photo with my aunt and just my mom. I just haven’t talked with my aunt in so long because my Mom didn’t want me too and I had no malicious intent to hurt my mother. 

EDIT: This got some ppl confused. The day my mother took me dress shopping, before hand I told her I didn’t want to go. Then she took me there anyways, made me only try on dresses she liked, and told me to get a waist trainer so I can look thinner.

86,1cv04z4,AITA for not giving my daughter full access to her trust fund? ,"
Hi there, first of all i do apologize for the format and incase theres any grammatic mistakes English is not my first (nor my most) speaked language. 

For context when I found out I was pregnant my whole family was extremely happy and my mom and her husband (dad 2) and my dad made a retiring fund for 18 years with the intention of paying for my baby's college education, they gave me full control of this investment portfolio and me and my husband made contributions to it with every paycheck. 

The investment fund grew more than any of us could imagine, it's enough to pay for her college if she doesn't get an scholarship and after that it still leaves a very big sum of money that would allow her to have a head start in life. 

My daughter just turned 18 (the legal adult age in my country) and she has known about this investment fund since she was 14, so now that she's 18 she's asking to ave the fund transfered in her name, but I said no. 

My reasoning is she's still a teenager that would find herself with way more money than a teenager should have, I offered to compromise and pay for her education with the fund (as that was the intention) and in case she needed any money from it or wanted to use any money from it we can discuss it and use the money if we see fit. 

She called me an ah and accused me of wanting to use her money on other stuff (I don't need that money I earn pretty well or enough to live comfortably), but on my eyes I don't want to give a teenager a full trust fund because I'm scared she will spend it all and not have any money left for after college again it is a very big amount. 

My husband, my mom and my dad's are on my side, but there's some other family members (mil and sil) that are calling and telling me I'm an AH for stealing money from my daughter instead of just giving it to her. 

I didn't think that I was the AH until my mil and sil told me and now I'm starting to think I was one because the money was for her to use. 

Edit because I think my word choice was not very good, again I apologize English is not my first language and I don't even live in the us: 

The trust fund is the word I used that I thought it was best, but is an investment fund that was frozen for 18 years meaning I could not even if I wanted to (which I would never) take out money from there for 18 years, the 18 years are up and now I can have access to the full amount. 

The fund was set up in my name because at the time I was pregnant and my daughter could not be a part of that fund given that she was not born yet, with that being said. 

All the people that contributed were in an agreement that even if the money was on my name it was entirely my daughters money, it has no restrictions on what can be used for, but we all agree that it was for college. 

The reason I'm saying legally she can have the fund, is because she's 18, so she is able to have her own bank account and the funds transferred to that account without any issues. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for not giving my daughter full access to her trust fund?

Last night, one of my friends decided last minute to cancel our plans, so I went out without her. The plan was to just go to a local bar, have food and drinks, play pool, go home. I met up with the group of friends we usually hang out with.

And I had a really great time. No one asked me to buy drinks multiple times throughout the night. No one asked me to leave early because of drama with another person, nor asked me to stay later than I was comfortable, both things that happen when my friend and I go out. She is a very supportive and kind friend but she has very poor social etiquette and I just had a better time without her.

I made the mistake when she asked me if I had a good time going out of saying how wonderful my night was, how there was no drama and everything was perfect. She seemed offended so I asked why and asked if it was a better night because she wasn’t there. I said that no one did any one of a list of behaviors which detract from my enjoyment going out and said that she has engaged in those behaviors every single time. And now she is mad at me.

That got canceled, but he said that he'd be leaving for another vacation about a week later, and after that, once he got back in three weeks, he'd immediately fly out to see another friend. Before he'd leave, he'd hang out with some other friends. He never mentioned seeing me other than saying he wanted to see me this summer.

A day before he left, he said that he wanted to call me. He said to call me while I was on break or after work. I did. Both. It went to voice-mail both times. He texts me the next morning and says that he was busy because another friend came over, but that he can call me back when he is on layover. I told him being put-off in favor of other people. I told I thought it was his move to suggest a time to hang out and felt disappointed because he didn't. I felt like one thing was being said but another thing was being done. I apologized for dropping this on him before his vacation.

He apologized for making me feel that way. He said it was hard because I don't communicate and he always carries the conversation every time. He said that he's human and I made him feel less than.

91,1cuysy6,AITA for telling my daughter to do my son's chores?,"I have 2 wonderful kids, a son, Oscar 15M and a daughter, Holly 17F. My son gets very very bad migraines. He can't eat, can't sleep, can't do anything. Its a stressful time for everyone in our family and when he gets them he usually takes a day or 2 off school (it happens rarely so this is not an issue). He's currently in one of these 'episodes' as my wife and I have taken to calling them, so he is in the guest room resting. Obviosuly, he can't do chores when he's like this so usually me or my wife pick up the slack.

Holly always gets a bit edgy when Oscar has these attacks and generally acts a bit grumpy. I always assumed these were out of concern for her brother so would usually get her some sweets or something to take her mind off it. Today Holly saw me emptying the trash which is usually one of Oscar's chores and did that really prolonged sigh which people do when they want you to ask them whats wrong. I put the trash back and went to talk to her.

Holly is upset because we never do all this for her when she has a headache. I explained, gently, that Oscar doesn't get headaches, he gets migraines, and that when she's as sick as he is we do, do 'all this' but Holly was still upset. This all came on quite quickly so I tried to get her to understand, but she refuses she carried on telling me how Oscar should just get 'off his lazy butt',

I reprimanded her for talking about her brother like that, especially since she knows how hard this is for Oscar and he's hardly having a good time playing video games or something. (edit: as in he's not doing something enjoyable, not that he's not enjoying playing games, he can't play games rn). Holly continued saying it was unfair for us (edit: me and my wife, obviously not Holly) to do all his chores, and he should at least do the garden. We have a big garden, and neither me nor my wife is fit enough to take care of it like we used to and Oscar, being the sporty guy he is took over.

I told her, bluntly that if she cared so much about the garden, she could just do it herself. She got really mad about this and I'll admit I probably shouldn't have suggested it. She started accusing me of favoritism, etc. I told her to go to her room to calm down, because she was shouting loudly and Oscar was resting in the room right next to us. She stormed off.

92,1cuylor,AITA for not using a computer I got for my birthday?,"I (m14) had a birthday back in September, I hyped it up a lot. My Aunt’s husband (“uncle”) promised to get me a laptop for my birthday (I hadn’t had a new computer since like 2019 and the one I had was a old IMac my mom got me for Christmas, so you could imagine how happy I was to hear that I’d get a new one.) He made the promise to get me a laptop in i think like July? I showed him the laptops I wanted (plural ‘cus I kept changing my mind) and he was okay with it, until he wasn’t, when I found out that he wanted to get a Desktop (which I tried to warn him why they’re inferior to laptops, and why I didn’t want it AT ALL.) I found this out when I was at a Best Buy with him and my younger cousin, I was in the laptop section (which was not too far from the desktops) when I heard him whisper to my cousin along the lines of something like “(My name) wants this but we’re gonna get something like this *tapping on a desktop as he says it*” Which inclined me to give him a mean/annoyed look which he shrugged off. This also confused me a lot since the laptops I wanted were 700-900 dollars and the desktops he wanted were 1000 and up. (I forgot to mention that he is rich) nothing really happened after until it was like 2 weeks left until my birthday where I LITERALLY BEGGED AND GOT ON MY KNEES to reassure them to get a laptop. They said “okay” and told me to calm down, and so I waited.

You can probably already guess what they got me, I feel spoiled when I say this but; I literally cried when I made back to my room after seeing my presents. I felt really hurt and betrayed.

After maybe like 2 weeks? They started insulting me about not using it (Context: they placed in the basement and hooked it up to the same tv my cousin hogs for Xbox.) My “uncle” came into my room and basically called me an ungrateful bitch-boy that never cares for anyone but myself. He brought up points about how he could’ve “ruined my life” if he hadn’t gave my mom extra money for her job (i was very poor when I was living with my mom.) He said that it was a risk that he did that and all in my mind I could say “seriously dude?”. He said everything in a very passive-aggressive manner, After I STILL didn’t use it, he tried to guilt trip me saying that he put “so much thought into that present and that he’ll never buy me a present again.” He also managed to get my aunt on his side, also insulting me and even getting mad at me for just clicking keys on keyboard! (Unplugged btw).

I’d be wrong if I said they didn’t convince me to feel bad about myself and question my morality. This all made feel very spoiled but a teeny weeny percent in me makes me feel that I’m right. Am I actually spoiled and wrong?

What about sister and friend?” To which he responded “yeah that’s fine but just them, nobody else.” I said okay and made the group chat with everyone about it.
About a week later I received a text from sister asking who was all going. I told her who was invited and she responded with a text saying “and (boyfriend)” I told her no, it was just suppose to be her, no extended company. She got defensive saying that it was weird he couldn’t come and that she had already invited him. I told her idk why she did that when he wasn’t invited and that it’s Fiancés dinner and he’s allowed to invite whoever he wants. She continues questioning me saying that now it will be weird because she has to un-invite her boyfriend. She then texted my Fiance again asking if she could bring her boyfriend to which he responded no, she then said she wouldn’t be coming. Our mom said my sister should be able to bring her boyfriend and she agrees with sister that it’s weird he can’t come. A couple other people agreed with my sister and now they’re saying I’m an AH.

And then aunt said something directed towards me but said it to everyone in a jokingly manner (I call it passive aggressive) that unlike OP here.

I said nothing but when I went home,I talked it out with mom and she said oh she means well but like mom said that she might be prompted to say that comment because one time when she wanted to come over, I was dreading to make tea and stuff. Later mom was chatting with with her and said oh OP doesn't like doing stuff like that ( I don't but I still do it) and wasn't looking forward to make stuff.

Mom said I am too sensitive and need to get over it and learn proper cooking cause it would be handy for her to get help around the house.

It was by far the most stressful year of college, and I’m in the worst mental state of my life up to this point. I spent the past 2 months before school ended stressing about classes and what would happen if my grades weren’t stellar. I’ve been working since early March on getting an internship/pharmacy tech job over the summer. I’ve applied for at least 40 jobs and every time it’s the same response. Either “We’re not looking for anyone working over the summer” or “You don’t have experience in this field yet so we can’t do anything for you.” (Despite this being an entry level position and I have the certifications). 
Aside from this, part of my degree is working an approved internship for a semester. Based on how tough classes were this semester, there is no way I can work a job while in school, which only leaves this summer. I cannot get a different job, as this would not meet the requirements. 
My Dad lives on a farm, so I tend to stay with my Mom during summers as there aren’t openings in my college town or the nearest town to my Dad. I’ve been home a total of 4 days so far, and every day has been the same. I get a call/text from my Mom about how I am failing in life and need to work immediately. I have gone into detail at least 4 times to her about my situation and how I am trying my best, but there is nobody willing to hire. 
At first, I figured that she had good intentions and wanted her son to have a job that he could succeed in. After today, I have absolutely no idea what her intentions are. After stepping into my car after speaking face to face with a pharmacy employee about a job, I receive a call from my Mom. When I pick up, I can immediately tell that this was not a civil conversation, but one that was fueled by anger and dissatisfaction from her own day. It began with “Why have you not done anything with your summer?” As we went on, things got uglier as I could feel the disrespect and resentment through the phone. Eventually, one phrase made me snap. I stated that she had no idea how hard I’ve worked and the effort I put in every day to get one of these jobs. It simply amazes me how out of touch with the job market she is, especially when you consider she’s had the same job for over 2 decades, and it did not require the amount of work that this entry level job does. I’m not sure if it’s generational differences, but I’m over the “Gen Z doesn’t want to work” narrative. I’ve explained my situation day after day, and nothing gets better. I am genuinely doing everything I can.

98,1cux1cz,AITA for kicking out my brother the next day after my birthday party?,"A few weeks ago I celebrated my birthday. A few friends and my brother came over; my brother by car from another city 2 hours away. We played games, drank (a lot of) alcohol and had fun. At 2 am my friends went home. My brother on the other hand wanted to go into the city and keep on partying. I denied because I was also tired so he went a lone.

He came back the next morning (10 am) totally wasted, sat down and grabbed himself another beer from the fridge. He drank 5 more beers until 3 pm.

99,1cuwyjm,AITAH for asking my room mates to not smoke cigarettes in our garage with doors/windows closed while we house a stray ,"Recently I had a stray cat wonder to my house. My partner, me, and another roommate have decided to shelter him in the garage until we can safely transition him inside (we have other cats). We have two other roommates (gf/bf) who have been smoking cigarettes in the garage prior to. Problem is, they smoke without opening any doors or windows. 
Now with the stray in the garage, we’ve asked if they can smoke outside in a different area until the cat is inside. Since asking, they have refused to smoke anywhere else besides in the garage, but now with cracking the door open. I have to emphasize, crack. The door can barely fit my fingers out of it. Now it has become a petty war trying to prove “the cat won’t get out if we smoke and crack the door,” and hot boxing the cat.

100,1cuw4e8,AITA for calling out my friend for his weird relationship with his Asian GF?,"My friend (we're both 25M, we'll call him Joe) has recently gotten into his first relationship (22F). She is Chinese. Me and my friend group (we're all white) were all happy for him for finally getting a girlfriend. However, me and a few of my other friends noticed he would be weirdly demeaning when talking about her. Joe would rarely ever refer to her name when talking about her, he would literally refer to her as ""my Asian girlfriend"".

Last night me and the guys got together for drinks. We were talking about relationships etc. and I asked Joe why he always called his girlfriend his ""Asian girlfriend"" and he replied ""well she's Asian isn't she?"".  And then mentioned that I don't have a girlfriend so I can't relate. Which was weirdly hostile and strange considering he knows I've been in long term relationships before. I snapped and said ""at least my exes could speak English"". Which was terrible of me to say I know. We've only met Joe's girlfriend once, she barely spoke and clearly didn't speak much English so I used that as ammunition, I do regret insulting an innocent girl like that. I quickly apologised for being out of line and Joe said it's okay but stopped speaking much afterwards. The rest of the night was pretty normal but it was clear that Joe was uncomfortable.

I apologised again via text after the night. He hasn't responded yet. AITA? My friends said to just give it time and that we all joke around like that to each other all the time anyway. There is a part of me that feels like Joe deserved someone calling out his weird behaviour though.

101,1cuvzrj,AITA for sleeping through a house-warming sleepover instead of playing video games? ,"I was introduced to my boyfriend's friend group a little over a year ago. One of them just moved to another city, and she invited us over to her new flat for a small housewarming party with gin and video games.

We were 5 people, giving all fake names here; me(F28), my boyfriend Max(26M), Hannah(F27), her boyfriend John(M26), and another friend, Ian(M26).

For context, I'm a foreigner in their country, and except for my boyfriend Max, they don't speak English. I however speak their language somewhat, so we can communicate without problem when *sober*. I am very lightweight compared to them, so I get knocked out early in the evening and they'll go on until morning. They're well aware and understanding of this and it has become sort of an inside joke.

Anyway, on Friday we had a drink outside and then went back to Hannah's to continue and play games. I had ordered a custom cake and brought snacks from my home country, and also brought a deck of cards.

I'm not a video games person, so I was hoping we'd do some drinking games or cards as well. But the whole evening turned into *only* video games. I was already a little drunk, the instructions were in their language, they were loud and slurring when explaining, and clicked by the tutorial too quickly. There were 4 controllers and we were 5 people, and while I joined in on playing at first, I couldn't really get into the fun as I was unsure of the gameplay and I felt embarrassed constantly asking for help. My head wasn't cooperating and I felt bad that John was on the side watching when he'd have more fun playing than me. 

I said I was too drunk to play, gave the controller to John and fell asleep behind the couch. They played until late, we all woke up at 2pm the next day, had lunch, and I thought we were going back home. However they started another round of video games and kept going until 10pm. I honestly didn't know what to do in the meantime. Slept through some of it, watched YouTube videos the rest. Felt my Saturday was sort of wasted.

Now that we're back, Max is telling me how I ruined the mood and how I was rude for refusing to play. My opinion is that I am not a video games person, I didn't understand the rules though I tried, and if I knew we were only going to play video games I wouldn't have brought my deck of cards nor accept the invite in the first place. Max still says I could've at least watched while they played. For me, it doesn't make sense to watch hours of gameplay I neither understand nor enjoy that much while trying to keep up with the excited yelling and cursing of a language I'm not fluent in. I could've maybe joined in if they'd play 15-20 minute rounds instead of 60 minute ones. And I also think that if they notice one person is not really enjoying it, why not stop playing for even a few minutes to do something that person would enjoy, too?

I tried to explain that I just hate the way people pity me and like they just treat me differently and it’s fucking annoyingg. My mom said that if I didn’t want her to tell people then I shouldn’t have gotten addicted and she said I was being selfish by not wanting her to have like support from other people. I don’t care about her talking to me to like a couple people because like i’m kind of a dick so like it makes sense that she’d like complain about me but I just don’t want her to talk about me to literally everyone. Like these people don’t know me and will never know me I hate it when they pretend like they do just because my moms told them some shit.

108,1cuuzi7,WIBTA if I was mad at my friends because they canceled our plans to spend the night with women?,"Me and my friends, Tim and Tom, wanted to go partying tonight. We planned it a week ago and I was really looking forward to it. We wanted to go to a different city and really let it rip. 



Now the following happened yesterday evening: We met up spontaneously last night after each of us had gone out. We were all drunk and sat there chatting. Tim says “Let's go to the club”. I look at the clock and realize it's almost 2 in the morning. What's more, Tim has suggested a club where (no joke) there was an event for older people last night. In other words, really senior citizens. The event was called “Gymnastics and dance for the elderly”. And since we wanted to party today, I said I wasn't going. Tim and Tom went without me.



Now I got a call this afternoon. Tim and Tom asked me if I could pick them up because they are somewhere in the middle of nowhere. He gave me an address and it was just ages away. I drove an hour to pick them up there. Here's what happened: They must have met a couple of GILFS at the party yesterday and had an orgy last night. I even saw the grannies. They accompanied the boys to my car. They were 50 or 60 or something. They told me everything on the way back.



Now to the crux of the story: they want to cancel the party tonight because they're still totally wasted from last night. Now I don't know whether I should be mad or not. I mean, is an orgy with grandmas an acceptable reason to cancel plans with friends?

109,1cuuvta,AITA for not letting my gf's nieces have my childhood toy? ,"My (22F) gf's mom came over with two of my gf's nieces (6 and 3F). We were welcoming and nice and let the two girls nap in my room when they got tired. 

They had found my childhood stuffie, which is  a husky I had named Emma and took her everywhere for 15 years. Emma is also wearing my favorite shirt from when I was two, because I wanted to keep it close. They took a huge liking to her and asked if they could take Emma back home with them, because I clearly didn't need it. 

I told them no, and explained how much I loved her and how much she meant to me. I told them that I had a great aunt who I loved, but she'd passed away long ago and she had gotten me Emma when I was a baby, so I didn't want to let go. I (slightly embarrassedly) told them I actually still slept while cuddling her. I told them the story of the shirt, but they wouldn't budge. 

They began screaming because I wasn't letting them have the husky. My gf's mom heard what was going on and immediately sided with the girls, because 'I am too old for a stuffed toy' and 'shouldn't really care'. She called me an a-hole and told me that I'm pathetic for 'loving to make innocent children cry' and that 'I just love the feeling of power I have over them', before leaving, with the promise of coming back to get the husky when I couldn't do anything about it. 

My gf and her dad are siding with me, but my gf's siblings, mom and aunts are all with the two girls. So, AITA? 

Update: I have reached out through my gf and offered to buy the girls similar ones from Amazon or IKEA, but I've been told it's got to be Emma because the girls want the shirt too

Update 2: this got deleted earlier but Emma has been taken to safety, a ring camera and mini security cameras have been ordered, and my gf's family except her dad have secured a nice telling off/talking to (read: yelling at for upsetting me)

Update 3: I didn't think I'd be back so soon but here I am.

It’s often said they stay away for some time out at times. So 5yo has made a homophonic slur to the neighbours child. I must stress he has been punished for this. I don’t have a clue where he’s heard this word and I in one bit do not condone it. I’ve been understanding and sympathetic in this whole situation given the child he’s said it to identifies as a different gender. Hence the level of upset.

The mother has requested the children don’t engage in any further conversation or play for a while. Im on board with that, however her children kept striking up conversation with my child and I had to have a conversation with her to say I can’t be running out dragging him away when they are the ones being inviting to him.

I moved into my first apartment by myself 1 and 1/2 years ago mostly due to privacy issues with my parents, my fiancé moving in with me this past October. At my parents house it was accustomed for my grandparents (my mom’s dad and step mom) to come into and out of of house as they please as they lived next door and frequently did their laundry at our house. So it wasn’t out of the ordinary to see mail on the kitchen table that they’re brought in or have them just come right in to deliver a card. In my new place I value my privacy and so I keep it locked up and I don’t invite people to be over when I am not home. I make it clear to call me before coming over. 
This brings us to a couple of weeks ago, my fiancé and I shared a birthday. A big thing in my family(as most) is giving cards for special events. The big day came and went and we carried on into the next week. That Wednesday we had all day plans and were gone from our house all day long. When we got home a card was on the table addressed to myself. I asked my fiancé if he had put it there or knew where it had come from. When he said he didn’t I connected the dots pretty quickly and realized my grandmother brought it over and got it into our place while we were not home.  I waited until my anger subsided and messaged her to see how the card had gotten onto our kitchen table. She said the door was “not shut tight” so she “walked in and said hi to all the cats, left the card and then left. “ I very clearly remember locking the door before we had gone out for the day and our door does not come open if it is locked. I had watched the ring camera and knew what she said was not entirely true. I stated she has to ask to come into our house and that we’d like our privacy respected. She says she “did not mean to offend” us but I don’t know. There’s a good chance she has seen me use my spare key so I am thinking that is how she got in. She never asked to come over or in, and never called to let me know she had been by.

112,1cuupj0,AITA for telling my dad off for playing loud videos while I am driving?,"So, I guess that there’s always that one person who watches videos loudly in public, I feel that it’s just because they aren’t bothered by it or annoyed by the loud music that comes with many clips these days. My dad is one of them. And since most TikTok’s that my dad either watches or gets sent to him by his friends have music as a background, it does get pretty annoying for anyone around him.

So we are from a south East Asian country which happens to have very lax driving laws, people can kind of drive however they please with very little regulation so I don’t really pay that much attention when I’m driving in my own country. I’m fine with loud distractions because our city is “vibrant” to put it in a good way.

However we are currently in Australia which has stricter driving laws (I drove in Germany and Czech Republic which I think are the strictest) and I am also not familiar with the roads and I have to use Google maps to get to every destination. I actually told him off for disconnecting the iPhone cable because I needed the Google maps display (we didn’t have a phone stand AND he is terrible at reading directions)

So, while I am driving, very focused as I wasn’t sure which lane I needed to be in, all of a sudden he opens up a video on his phone which was set at full volume. I yell at him, “dad seriously I’m having trouble focusing on the road!!! This is Australia!!! I need to keep track of a lot of things!!”

He turned off his phone and I then calmly said “dad, it would’ve been alright if this happened at home because I’m familiar with the roads and laws. Let’s not forget that we aren’t at home and I really need to focus on the road and follow the stricter laws and Google.”

The next day while we were driving through a country single lane road, he did it again, and I said “dad what’s that video about?” Turns out his friend just sent him this tiktok that showed floods in Brazil but with very loud music in the background. 

After 5 minutes, I said “just wanted to say this, if me or my brother opened up a video and it had really loud music we would get really embarrassed and turn the volume down instantly and hope that nobody noticed.”

He gave a response along the lines of “doesn’t really matter that much to me.”

The general theme is about him turning on loud videos in public, however I just got really annoyed in this instance. I felt that it was justified because it was a distraction from driving and I could’ve made a wrong turn (Sydney is crazy to drive through) or worse.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for telling my dad off for playing loud videos while I am driving?

114,1cuuiwb,AITA for getting in a fight with my husband after he forgot my birthday?,"Last Friday my husband went to the doctor because of a sore throat and fever. The doctor diagnosed it as tonsillitis and prescribed him antibiotics. He was really sick and stayed home from work past the weekend. 

He knew that my birthday was coming up this week and that I was planning a brunch get together with some friends the following weekend. 

On Tuesday, my actual birthday, I went to work and my husband stayed home from work. While I was at work we texted throughout the day. He asked me if I had chosen the restaurant location for my weekend brunch but he never wished me a happy birthday or anything like that. I came home from work and still nothing. He ordered himself a pizza because he was starting to feel a little better from the tonsillitis and had a bit of an appetite again. I spent all evening waiting for him to say something about my birthday but he never brought it up. 

The following day we were talking again about the location of the weekend brunch when I asked him, “Do you know the actual date of my birthday?” He responded, “Oh shit, is it today?!” as he checked his phone and told him that it was yesterday. 

Initially he was sympathetic about forgetting my birthday but it quickly switched from that to him being upset with me for not letting it slide due to his illness. He thinks because he was sick that I should understand why he forgot my birthday. To a certain extent I see where he’s coming from but at the same time I don’t feel like I was asking for much. I would have been perfectly satisfied with a HBD text or just any sort of acknowledgement. I get that he was sick but tonsillitis doesn’t prevent you from being able to check the date on your phone and sending out a simple text message. He knew that my birthday was coming up, we talked about the weekend birthday plans on my actual birthday. But he never thought to check the date?

So now he’s telling me that I’m a selfish brat because I am fighting with him for forgetting my birthday. How am I the bad guy when he’s the one who forgot my birthday? AITA?

115,1cuuihm,AITA Finally moving out of my MIL house but she just found out she has breast cancer ,"Some background story: my MIL has been my best friend since I started dating her son. When I was going through hard times she always did her best to help me, especially while pregnant. My partner lost a lot of money in something he couldn’t control so we decided to move back to his hometown from Hawaii and live with his parents so his mom could get time with her future granddaughter, which is something she has always wanted the MOST. 

Anyways, I started going a little stir crazy… when I say a little, I mean a lot. I kept telling them that we were going to move in February, it’s now may. We just didn’t have enough money until now. I seriously can’t take living at his parents house anymore. It drives me insane living in a place that doesn’t feel like mine. She never took her stuff out of our room so I never have anywhere to put mine. The dogs downstairs get on all the furniture and now we’ve been dealing with ticks. Everything is uncomfortable for me. I feel like we’re getting on his dads nerves particularly. One night, I couldn’t find my keys in my purse when it was raining in the dark and my baby was crying so hard outside I just rang the door bell. He got so mad at that. It was 7pm. I’ve been a very independent person since I was 16. I always had my own money and job and my dad was a truck driver so I basically lived alone. I don’t want to live in MD ANYMORE. I don’t have friends here, I don’t have a job and I feel so stuck.

At the beginning of may I went to go visit my family in CO in the hopes of touring an apartment, volunteering and feeling out everything. I had that feeling again that I had when I made the jump of moving and loved it before in the past. When I was in CO my partner mentioned that his mom has to get a biopsy for cancer and the appointment is the 16th and she kept joking that she hopes she has cancer so we don’t move, which I was planning for the 25th of this month. Well, she has breast cancer. 

I feel so sad for her. I’ve been cooking and taking care of her and I bought her an orchid to try to lift her spirits. I love her like she is my own mother, but when I think about staying here and giving up summer with my sisters who I barely get to see since my parents divorce when I was a kid, it’s truly heartbreaking. It makes me cry. I just pictured all of the summer memories i would get to make with my brother, his kids, my sisters, my dad and my daughter for the first time. My family in CO has never even met my daughter and his mom has spent every day of the last six months with her. I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much for my partner and his mom this past year. So much that I’ve lost myself. AITA for still wanting to move?

My partner lost a lot of money in something he couldn’t control so we decided to move back to his hometown from Hawaii and live with his parents so his mom could get time with her future granddaughter, which is something she has always wanted the MOST. 

Anyways, I started going a little stir crazy… when I say a little, I mean a lot. I kept telling them that we were going to move in February, it’s now may. We just didn’t have enough money until now. I seriously can’t take living at his parents house anymore. It drives me insane living in a place that doesn’t feel like mine. She never took her stuff out of our room so I never have anywhere to put mine. The dogs downstairs get on all the furniture and now we’ve been dealing with ticks. Everything is uncomfortable for me. I feel like we’re getting on his dads nerves particularly. One night, I couldn’t find my keys in my purse when it was raining in the dark and my baby was crying so hard outside I just rang the door bell. He got so mad at that. It was 7pm. I’ve been a very independent person since I was 16. I always had my own money and job and my dad was a truck driver so I basically lived alone. I don’t want to live in MD ANYMORE. I don’t have friends here, I don’t have a job and I feel so stuck.

At the beginning of may I went to go visit my family in CO in the hopes of touring an apartment, volunteering and feeling out everything. I had that feeling again that I had when I made the jump of moving and loved it before in the past. When I was in CO my partner mentioned that his mom has to get a biopsy for cancer and the appointment is the 16th and she kept joking that she hopes she has cancer so we don’t move, which I was planning for the 25th of this month. Well, she has breast cancer. 

I feel so sad for her. I’ve been cooking and taking care of her and I bought her an orchid to try to lift her spirits. I love her like she is my own mother, but when I think about staying here and giving up summer with my sisters who I barely get to see since my parents divorce when I was a kid, it’s truly heartbreaking. It makes me cry. I just pictured all of the summer memories i would get to make with my brother, his kids, my sisters, my dad and my daughter for the first time. My family in CO has never even met my daughter and his mom has spent every day of the last six months with her. I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much for my partner and his mom this past year. So much that I’ve lost myself. AITA for still wanting to move? ",0.0,0.025020204484462738,0,1
116,1cuuedy,WIBTA if I cancelled a trip because my friends can't join?,"My best friend and I go to an amusement park much like Disney every year and stay in a hotel in the park for a night.

This year my friend asked to bring some of her friends. At first I was okay with it, even though I don't match with her other friends at all, because she said I could bring my friends as well. They would not be staying overnight, they would only come for one of the days.

Sadly, none of my friends have time. So I asked my best friend if we could go alone because I would feel very excluded. I am a very anxious and socially awkward person. Whenever I hang out with her other friends, I usually end up alone and my efforts to join a conversation are ignored. And, to be honest, I don't want to spend an expensive vacation being alone and miserable. Her response was to ask more people to join so that no one would be alone. I feel ignored and thinking about the trip now puts a bad feeling in my stomach.

At the same time, I feel selfish. They will only be there one day and I should suck it up. I agreed at first that we could bring friends and I feel like it would be selfish to not go just because it didn't work out for me.

118,1cutdc8,AITA for making my sister's stepson pay back what he spent (stole)?,"**EDITED - SEE BOTTOM FOR CLARIFICATION OF FREQUENT COMMENTS/QUESTIONS**

This seems like it would be pretty straightforward, except I got the 'tism and and I'm having a hard time processing the negativity.

My sister's stepson (?m), at some point when my sister was housesitting while I was working in a remote location, stole one of my credit cards and racked up $1,400US in charges to a mobile game. My sister, her husband, and I sat down with the child and had a conversation, while on speaker with a state police officer, letting him know that the only reason he wasn't being arrested for grand theft was due to his age. Sister, BIL, and I all agreed that if the bank doesn't reverse the charges, that his XBOX, bike, and Switch will be sold to recoup the costs. If that doesn't cover the debt, any money he earns over the summer break will be given to me. He's also been informed that he is no longer trusted to be in my home, supervised or not. Everyone is in agreement, he fucked up and there are consequences. 

Everyone except his birth mother and his grandparents.

His mother is calling me a ""greedy and selfish asshole"" because, in her words to me, ""you make three times that debt in a single pay period, what's it to you?"" She's now gone as far as messaging people in my friend group and leaving out the part that her son stole almost $1,500 from me.

His grandparents are accusing me of basically the same thing, and have threatened to go to the police for ""stealing his things"" (the bike and consoles).

Edit 1 - 

I will not state his age, but he's under the minimum age to arrest for anything other than a Class A or Unclassified felony in my state. Theft in the Second Degree is a Class C felony.

Edit 2 -

This was an ongoing theft from 15/04/24  until 16/05/24, when I got back to civilization. My work often has me in the most remote parts of the state.

121,1curffd,AITA for being tired of my Dad?,"To start this off, I wasn't a very good teenager. 

I was mean, rebellious, loud, disrespectful and the main root of it was issues that I can't quite go into. Not that I literally cannot but would just genuinely not want to due to these events being traumatic to me. 

My Dad has never been terribly open. He prefers to talk to his friends more than he does me or my mother and often gives me one word responses and when he doesn't, he's often expressing his disapproval or distaste for something I'm wearing or doing, such as eating past a certain time, or wearing a crop top. (I'm 20F. Overweight, but not the biggest I could be, I've lost about 25-30 pounds since Feb of this year) 

My father has this perception of me that I am still the teenager I was at fifteen. I've done alot to change who I've been because I didn't like who I was then, and I sometimes don't now but that has more to do with my trauma and looks rather than anything that's actually important. I try to be a good person, and I know I fall short but I am trying. 

Like I said, my dad doesn't talk to me much. He leaves home at 7 am, gets home at 7:30 (by choice. he used to come home at 5-6 but since the pandemic, he chose to work longer hours), and when he does get home, he greets my mother, goes outside to greet the dog and usually doesn't look at me besides from the affectionate term of 'Fat Girl.' 

My mother says he doesn't talk to me because I'm 'dramatic' and that he prefers to stay away from confrontation. I'm very upfront about problems going on in the house, things I notice in the pets that are worrisome, asking him to check the Attic once he has the time (I suspected there were rats, and he told me to leave him alone and that it's a branch. It turned out to be rats, I heard one crawling into our house and one crawling up a pipe) and telling him that he's wrong for criticizing my mom for stupid things. She bought some silly little taco shell holders and he got annoyed, said she was always buying stupid shit and I said she could buy whatever she liked because it was her money and why not, they were cute and he didn't need to say it to her face because it would hurt her feelings. 

Somedays, I get depressed thinking about our relationship. I bottle up alot of my emotions to keep the relationship steady because it's basically built on popsicle sticks, but it never really works. I remember one time after a particularly stressful couple of weeks, I started yelling and crying, he slammed a door and my only thought was that I messed up again and he wasn't going to talk to me AGAIN.

123,1cur30l,WIBTA for telling my father I don't love him?,"To start, my father(54) and I(21M) didn't always have such a bad relationship. When I was younger, he had always been one of my best friends, and was always there for me- especially after my mom and I stopped talking when I was 12. The rough spot started when I was 15 and told him that my mother and I were reconnecting. It was like some switch flipped in his brain, and I specifically remember watching all the affection he had for me melt off his face as he told me: ""She's a nasty person and you don't want her in your life, but if it makes you happy, whatever."" 

I was heartbroken. I knew he and my mother had a rough relationship, but I thought he would at least be happy for me. There was a lot of arguments about my mom after this; even if it didn't involve her, he always found a way to make it about her. Most of these ended with him calling me a snowflake, saying I'm just like my mom or straight up calling me a slur, which had NEVER happened before.

There's been many things that have made me realize I don't love my dad since this sudden change in his behavior. He's an all around miserable person and I'm fully convinced he's only happy when he's spreading his misery. All he ever does is argue with me, argue with strangers on the internet, and complain to himself out loud. He doesn't have friends to hang out with because he says he doesn't need friends, he has no romantic life because he's disgusted by women, and he doesn't go out in public unless he has to because he hates society. Admittedly he's had a lot of stuff happen to him in his life, but he bottled up his anger and aimed it at the wrong things, like his kids, his ex-wife, and ""society.""  

I've also only recently realized that my dad basically let my life fall apart as a child too, and that's only been a bigger kick in the gut. He never enforced any rules and let me do whatever I wanted as a kid because ""that's only necessary because society said so"" and ""he was the same way."" This ended up with me having bad hygiene and being overweight as a kid, having bad grades and dropping out of school, quitting all my jobs, having a bad relationship with my brother, and having no social skills. Now I'm 21, financially reliant on him with no car, no insurance, bad teeth, no job, and no money. When I remind him that it was his job to teach me about these things, he tells me about ""everything he did for me-"" which is just the bare minimum of parental care like shelter, clothes, and food. My dad's a loser, and raised me to be a loser too.

The main point- My dad recently said something along the lines of ""You're lucky I love you so much or I'd kick you out.""

WIBTA for telling him how I feel?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"WIBTA for telling my father I don't love him? To start, my father(54) and I(21M) didn't always have such a bad relationship. When I was younger, he had always been one of my best friends, and was always there for me- especially after my mom and I stopped talking when I was 12. The rough spot started when I was 15 and told him that my mother and I were reconnecting. It was like some switch flipped in his brain, and I specifically remember watching all the affection he had for me melt off his face as he told me: ""She's a nasty person and you don't want her in your life, but if it makes you happy, whatever."" 

I was heartbroken. I knew he and my mother had a rough relationship, but I thought he would at least be happy for me. There was a lot of arguments about my mom after this; even if it didn't involve her, he always found a way to make it about her. Most of these ended with him calling me a snowflake, saying I'm just like my mom or straight up calling me a slur, which had NEVER happened before.

There's been many things that have made me realize I don't love my dad since this sudden change in his behavior. He's an all around miserable person and I'm fully convinced he's only happy when he's spreading his misery.

124,1cuqygb,AITA for starting a fight with my bf over his acceptance into an ivy league university?,"I (m18) and my boyfriend (m18) have been dating for a few years now. Throughout our relationship, he's always been smarter than me. Better grades, test scores, numerous scholarships- and I was really proud of him for it. He worked hard, he earned all of it. 

Me, on the other hand, barely graduated by the skin of my teeth. No awards. No scholarships. Nothing. I tried my best, and while I'm not trying to make excuses, I've been coming out of some rough situations and have had little engery towards the end of the year to devote to my grades. I've really just been trying to pass. 

This difference had never caused issues between us in the past. 

Regardless, at the end of the day, I haven't always been the smartest at school, and only have a handful of subjects come as easy to me as they do for my boyfriend. I granted with a 3.6 GPA. My boyfriend graduated with a 5.0.

Both our parents put pressure on us to achieve good things. Naturally, they tended to compare me to my boyfriend a lot. It didn't used to bother me. Right up until my boyfriend got accepted into Yale not too long ago. And I had been happy for him.

But then he started putting pressure on me about my own future. He told me in many ways that I had wasted my potential by not putting in more work, and also thought I underestimated how much I was capable of. Thing is, he never used to talk to me like this until he got accepted. 

Afterwards, he started making sly remarks about my grades and began speaking poorly about those who attended community college. I'm attending community college.

This led up to a pretty bad fight (of which I did start by making a passive aggressive comment when he was talking about his acceptance letter), and a couple more until it was time for him leave for Connecticut. I didn't show up to say goodbye at the airport, and he didn't text me to ask if I was coming in the first pace. We still haven't said a word.

The relationship has disintegrated so much that I've suffered from depression (which I am recovering, and healing from).

Here is the basic gist:

1. Both my sisters have been accusing me of faking my disease (I have chronic pain and severe vomiting = Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome).
2. Calling me an attention whore, a hypochondriac, a slob, etc...
3. Stealing my things, then when confronted saying the stolen item is useless to me because I'm too fat, too sick, etc...
4. Ganging up on me and humiliating me it seems at any opportunity (especially in front of their boyfriends and family friends).
5. Making fun of and humiliating me while I was suffering from depression
6. Saying they believe I lied that I was SAed in university because they said the guy who SAed me is nice (an old drama teacher)

That's the short version of the list. I know it's awful.

The relationship hasn't improved no matter how hard I have tried to improve things or find out WTF is wrong.

Honestly, I've almost given up.

I'm moving out in a few weeks, I'm going to a new university, moving to a different province, and bought my plane ticket so the date of departure is settled (about 3 weeks from this post).

Although I am relieved to say that soon I won't have to deal with their bullying anymore, I still don't want to leave without making things right with my sisters or giving them a warning of what is to come (an ultimatum).

The ultimatum would be that they drastically change their attitude towards me otherwise I will not be a part of their lives anymore. I will always love them, as their older sister, but I will keep them at a very long distance. I will not seek interaction with them, and if they wish to interact with me, I will not be available for them.

Even though I know that I'm not in the wrong for how I'm feeling, I still fear that I will the ashamed if I completely cut out my sisters from my life if they do not comply with the ultimatum.

I keep thinking about how this might affect my relationship with my parents or the rest of my family. The rest of my family certainly would not understand (even if I explained why). As for my parents, I can't think of how to navigate Christmas with my sisters still living at home. Having to refuse certain activities because my sisters will be there without becoming the asshole.

I told her a) I have 70+ pounds on her b) I’m a man and she’s a woman c) I have 3.5 years of experience on her. For all those reasons I thought it was common sense she wouldn’t be stronger than me, and so assumed she knew that and was joking.

She claimed that soon she’ll be stronger than me and able to lift more than me, which I chuckled at, because I thought she was being playful, but she looked upset and asked why I was laughing. I asked if she was being serious, and she said she in fact was and asked why I would think otherwise. 

I told her a) I have 70+ pounds on her b) I’m a man and she’s a woman c) I have 3.5 years of experience on her. For all those reasons I thought it was common sense she wouldn’t be stronger than me, and so assumed she knew that and was joking.

She says I’m an unsupportive AH for laughing at her, but I think my assumption is common sense.

132,1cuoy3c,AITA for not helping my sister,"Long story short, I (F19) refused to pick up my sister (F18) from the shopping mall. Im struggling with anxiety disorder and driving is still hard for me, I don’t like driving when i’m already in an anxious state, it can be dangerous bc I can’t concentrate. I also had bad stomach cramps on that day (which made my anxiety even worse) and asked my sister if there isn’t another option for her to get home. She said her friend can bring her home. 
When she got home, she screamed at me how egocentric I am and I never want to help her out since I refused a few times already to pick her up or bring her somewhere - there was always another option for her to go to her destination. I also drive her whenever I don’t feel anxious and I think that I’m capable of driving without an anxiety attack. 
I get it that family helps each other and I do help her wherever I can. I just wanted to set this one boundary: when I’m really anxious, I don’t want to drive. If there’s no other option I would have still done it, I did it a few times. I just don’t feel comfortable driving with anxiety because A. it’s dangerous B. I don’t want to risk an anxiety attack. Even though I would have probably survived this 20 minute drive. 
Also it wasn’t planned for me to pick her up, she asked me when she was already there for a few hours, 1h before she wanted to go home.
My mum is on her side as well and know I’m not sure. Was it wrong to set this boundary in the first place? It gets ignored so much, should I just always push through the anxiety when it comes to helping people?

Edit: My sister doesn’t have a license yet, she was in the process but paused it for a while due to stressful exams (which I totally understand)

I had anxiety since I can think of and I started therapy freshly and I’m currently on the way of bettering myself (I couldn’t get therapy earlier bc my mum said I don’t need it). It’s just a process and I have my good days and bad days. On good days I do drive her where I can.

She’s been to the doctors for 7 years and they’ve not been able to tell her what it is. 
Recently she decided to go to our home country to get a test, and they were immediately able to figure out the issue. Wow. Turns out it’s to do with her spine, which is a lot worse than a hip problem. 
Now here comes the issue. I rarely tell people things that happen in my life, they always tell me to open up and stuff. So I decided to finally try it out and start off with this, hoping for some comfort and support, esp with the uk dr situation. Now my friend group constantly make jokes against one another, one of my friends is quite literally borderline racist, we will call him H. I tell my tougher stories with a joke because that’s just who I am, and I did so with this issue. I was quite frustrated with how poorly the uk doctors were, so I started off basically saying British people are stupid, followed by British doctors are stupid (once again, we make jokes like this all the time, I ask ways say I hate x as a joke. H himself says he hates French people as a joke, we say Americans are stupid etc. Obviously we do not actually believe this. British banter. Note that I also have lived here since 2 years old. I also obviously don’t think doctors are stupid, UK medical care has a lot of separate issues that lead to this, but some drs truly seem to not care tbh)

Now H sees the message and gets offended by this, and tells me to calm down.. which I find rude, as I quite literally just said my mother has received no help for 7 years for a spinal issue. He then continues, saying there’s no need for nation bashing… when even he has made the same joke about other countries.

Usually he'd dodge the question but this time he like fully answered. I was just minding my business eating breakfast and he told my brother that he was the favorite.

 Completely ruined my day. I expected my dad like to say both of us or no one or something like that but no. I asked my dad if he was serious and he started laughing until he noticed that I got sad Ig. He said that he thought about it and he had more stuff in common with my brother which is why he's the favorite. 

I told my dad that I always thought he didn't like me but having it said outloud was different. My dad then started getting defensive saying that he didn't like me less and I wasn't interrupting it right. I asked my dad to clarify exactly what he meant and he said that he just like spending more time with my brother because he relates to him more because they have common interests. 

He tried to assure me that he still loves me the same but if I'm being honest that only hurt me worse.

I told him again that I always knew I wasn't liked very well because I can see that he visibly enjoys spending more time with my brother than he does with me and hearing him openly say that he was the favorite child wasn't surprising it was just hurtful to know that I was right.

 I guess this hurt my dad's feelings because he just hugged me and told me that he sorry if he made me feel that way as it wasn't his intentions and then he started to cry. He went to his room and haven't came out yet which was about an hour ago.

I feel bad for making my dad cry because that's not something he does often and because of that it's abnormal at least for him.

138,1cuo1pn,AITA for bribing my partner to not bring my daughter to her friend who bullies her.,"My partner (29F) and I (27M) have an 8-month-old daughter. Against my wishes, my partner chose her friend (28F) as our daughter's godparent. Due to the friend's toxic behavior, which my partner fails to see, I told my partner that her friend is no longer our daughter’s godparent. The friend embarrassed my partner at her birthday party which lingers in my mind constantly as it is a constant pattern her friend has done for the past 15 years since they have been friends. This thought lead to the decision to remove  her friend from our daughter’s life. Now AITA because I offered my partner $1,000 to spend with another friend, excluding the bully friend. My partner and any friend get $250, and the remaining $500 is for my daughter and her friends child/children. This is to avoid the visit with the toxic friend who my partner travels an hour away to visit where 50% of the time she complains when she’s home and wants to have a cry after which I don’t find normal.

Additional information: I have tried explaining to my partner how I see her friend as a bully and she admits her friend is bad, but still wants that connection and she doesn’t know why and neither do I. 
My partners family hates her friend because of situation in high school where her friend teased my partner, isolated her from her other friends, and spread some gossip to other people in her year group which embarrassed my partner. They didn’t attempt to stop the friendship though and just acknowledge it’s there. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for bribing my partner to not bring my daughter to her friend who bullies her.

Due to the friend's toxic behavior, which my partner fails to see, I told my partner that her friend is no longer our daughter’s godparent. The friend embarrassed my partner at her birthday party which lingers in my mind constantly as it is a constant pattern her friend has done for the past 15 years since they have been friends. This thought lead to the decision to remove  her friend from our daughter’s life. Now AITA because I offered my partner $1,000 to spend with another friend, excluding the bully friend. My partner and any friend get $250, and the remaining $500 is for my daughter and her friends child/children. This is to avoid the visit with the toxic friend who my partner travels an hour away to visit where 50% of the time she complains when she’s home and wants to have a cry after which I don’t find normal.

Additional information: I have tried explaining to my partner how I see her friend as a bully and she admits her friend is bad, but still wants that connection and she doesn’t know why and neither do I. 
My partners family hates her friend because of situation in high school where her friend teased my partner, isolated her from her other friends, and spread some gossip to other people in her year group which embarrassed my partner. They didn’t attempt to stop the friendship though and just acknowledge it’s there. ",0.0,0.9935044646263123,1,0

140,1cuntjp,AITA for getting a kid suspended because he shared details about my mental health ,"I 15f have been struggling with my mental health for quite a while now, I am quite an open person with my friends and will often spill my heart out to my friends. 

I met this guy 15m, who I’ll call Cas, 3 years ago, we were friends and I often vented to him and told him all my struggles. Now Cas has never really been a serious person and often jokes about mental health issues even if he doesn’t struggle with them.

Last week I heard that he was discussing my mental health with people I’m not particularly close with, instead of going straight to him i decided to tell my year co-ordinator, she said that she would pull him aside and discuss it with him. After chatting with our year coordinator he decided he was going to tell everyone I snitched on him for no reason, mind you multiple people reported him for joking about mental health and my name was never mentioned when he was pulled aside.

A few days later he muttered snitched to me and I turned around and yelled at him, I called him a couple of names that weren’t ok and when I discussed this with my year coordinator I made sure to tell her about what I had said and that I know it wasn’t ok, my friends had also revealed other stuff that he had done like telling people that am autistic without my permission. Now I discuss me being autistic quite openly and my mental health struggles are also quite obvious, but that doesn’t give him the right to discuss it without my permission.

My year coordinator pulled him out of class and called his dad to have a discussion about his mental health and talking about others. He was told that he wasn’t suspended and when I got home that day he messaged me saying that I had ruined his like and that I should deal with my own issues and not involve him. I took a photo of the message not even replying and blocked him, then I sent it to my year coordinator and she suspended him immediately.

My intent was never to get him suspended, just to get him to stop joking about my mental health, but he got suspended and apparently now has to move schools.

I feel like If I just ignored him instead of reporting him this wouldn’t have happened, however my mental health is quite personal and I don’t like people talking about it.

I don’t know what to do AITA?

**edit to clear up some info**
Just to clarify I am quite open with friends, I don’t tell any random people who will listen, it’s usually people who I’ve know for a while and trust. I also only mentioned it to him once because he saw my scars, I never intend to use my friends as therapists (as I already see a therapist) and if they were to ask me to stop they could. Also he was laughing about my mental health not just discussing it, as I am quite open about being autistic it didn’t bother me to much it was just the way he was talking about it.

Sorry for any confusion, and thanks for all of your feedback, I’m working on not being such an open book😁",Not the A-hole,2024-05-18,"AITA for getting a kid suspended because he shared details about my mental health  I 15f have been struggling with my mental health for quite a while now, I am quite an open person with my friends and will often spill my heart out to my friends.
