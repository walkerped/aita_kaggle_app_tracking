0,1cunkq9,AITA for asking my bf to cook rice?,"I (32F) was heading home after work today, so I called my bf (35M). We were having salmon and I wanted rice. Let’s call him Steve. Steve works from home. I asked Steve if he would start making the rice before I got home. My commute is 30 minutes and his dad was coming over at 6. I had left at 5 and the rice in question takes 45 minutes to make. Steve recalled an incident where he tried to make rice and it was undercooked, because he didn’t know how to make it. I told him what to do previously and told him to at least start boiling the water, so that would save me some time and it would be done by the time I got home. He told me no. I got a bit upset, because I wanted rice with my meal. He explained to me on the phone all the reasons why he cannot make rice and I will have to make it myself. I hung up on him.


When I got home, he ignored me. Silent treatment. His dad showed up. 
I proceeded to start making a frozen dumpling alternative, and went downstairs briefly to defuse. After our meal, my bf told me I should not expect him to make rice because he “cannot do it.” He told me “if I wanted rice, I should have made it myself,” and explained that I am manipulative for asking him to make that, or even start that. We got in a heated argument about the rice, in which I called him “lazy,” because he cannot do a simple task. He called me a bitch, and stormed off to play video games the rest of the night. I texted him to tell him how simple my request was, and I don’t appreciate being called a bitch. He sent me “the Narcissist’s prayer”.

2,1cunf2e,AITA for leaving my friend’s sleepover because she was on the phone with her boyfriend the whole time?,"Last weekend, I(18f) went to a sleepover at my friend’s(18f) house. She invited me to it around a week prior saying that we “needed to catch up with each other” since we haven’t went to the same school in around 4 years. I agreed with her and told her that I would come, solely because I missed her a lot and at one point in my life she was my best friend, but after middle school ended and we went our separate ways. We grew apart and slowly stopped reaching out to each other and only started back talking just a couple months ago.

When I first arrived to her house for the sleepover, she was already on the phone with her boyfriend(19m) and barely even noticed me walk into her house(the door was open because when I texted her that I was on the way, she told me that the door would be unlocked for me and I could just walk right inside.) I was trying to get her attention and when I finaly did, all she did was give me a wave and continued to to talk with her boyfriend on the phone. 

I found it pretty weird that she didn’t give me an actual greeting but I just shrugged it off because I thought that she would get off of the phone with him soon. She pointed me to the direction of her room so I could drop my stuff off, so I did just that. When I came back to the living room and tried to start conversation with her, she would just shut me down and continue to talk with him.

After a couple of hours of her barely even talking to me just to talk with him, I grabbed my bags and left without saying a word to her. She texted me around a hour afterwards asking me why I left and I responded to her saying that I left because I didn’t want to have a sleepover with someone who was just on the phone with their partner the whole entire time. I also told her that the whole sleepover was just a disappointment and for her to never invite me to one again. 

She took offense to this and told all of our mutual friends about it with some of them blocking me and calling me “self entitled”, and even had her boyfriend text me saying that i’m messed up and need to apologize, while my family thinks im not in the wrong at all and did the right thing.

But I honestly don’t know, so AITA?

3,1cun9z2,AITA for not paying my aunt,"My mom was in very bad health the last 3 years after getting covid. She was renting a house with my brother until they both got covid. I found them when they were not responding to my calls. My brother passed in his sleep and my mom was barely hanging on requiring a month in the icu. My mom moved back home but didn’t want to stay due to my bro passing there. At the time my aunt was trying to sell a manufactured home she no longer wanted bc her husband passed and didn’t want to visit Florida in the winter. She ended up giving it to mom and was signed over without stipulation/lien. My aunt paid about $20k for it several years prior and it was worth even less at the time it was gifted because the economy was in the tank. Not to mention my aunt was paying $700/month for lot rent, electric, upkeep and monthly insurance payments. My mom lived there nearly 3 years but sadly passed away 3 months ago d/t covid complications. During that time my mom paid the lot rent, did repairs after the hurricane and paid over $ 350 a month for insurance. 

Prior to my mom’s passing I haven’t heard from my aunt in over 15 years.  I called her to let her know she passed and that was it. Not any real empathy which doesn’t matter. She ended up calling me on mom’s bday last month and went into that mom agreed that the manufactured home would be sold after she passed and my aunt would be given ALL the proceeds. Of course the value is a little more now due to the strong housing market. However, I never heard of this arrangement and there was no will stating this. My mom mentioned to me before she passed about selling it and using the proceeds for an ALF since her health continued to decline. 

Currently I am going through the probate process which has turned out to be rather complicated and expensive. On top of being very time consuming. My mom also has a ton of medical and credit card debt. To be honest, I would be very lucky to break even especially since I am now paying the lot rent, listing fee, electric, landscaping and insurance for the home. 

While I appreciate my aunt gifting my mom the manufactured home, I feel it was also self serving bc she had problems selling it and didn’t want to pay the lot fee, upkeep and insurance. Plus she hasn’t offered to help with the lot fee or insurance payments or listing fee knowing that I am currently paying it. However, I am usually the type of person that tries to make everything right, to owe no one and not make enemies. However, I personally don’t feel like I owe her anything much less ALL the proceeds from a potential sale when I have other debts to resolve. Maybe, if all goes better than anticipated I could send her a portion of the proceeds, but it’s not looking like that will happen.

i 25 have a younger brother 21

growing up we got along really well, but about 3 years ago he rubbed me the wrong way and without details, i chose to go no contact until about 4 months ago. 

Now, he has two brand new children and a fiancé who chooses not to work. 

1 week after we reconnected, he asked me for a few dollars for gas. i said yes. 

the following weeks that amount slowly grew for pampers plus food for his kids and fiance. & even to hang out with a friend (?) 

still here 4 months later, & i’ve noticed that most of the time we have a conversation, 7/10 he asks for something (not much, but 1000 cuts). outside of that we don’t talk too often. BUT in his defense these are loans he asks for, he pays me back. 


i make enough money to support myself and help him this way. but honestly, i don’t want to.  

especially considering that his goal is to be a man who’s wife doesn’t NEED to work if she doesn’t want to. so she doesn’t. 

(e.g., it’s literally my birthday, he knows i just spent a lot of money for it, but he texts me to ask for $$ for him his two kids and fiance to eat. sends a pic as he’s in the drive thru. and then calls me bc i didn’t answer right away)

i want to be a good brother/uncle, and don’t want to seem selfish. just on my own terms, and once we have a more solid relationship post no-contact. 

not because he put himself in a bind.

at the end, i care for my brother as most people should. and he is putting the work in by keeping a job. but as it would be for most 21 year olds, its rough supporting 4 people on your own. 

so it makes me wonder

AITA?

also worth noting that when we were kids i would always buy us food/fun/pay for him without hesitation. but he was 11 not 21

5,1cun1h9,AITA? Kicking my friend out of my Apartment.,"So about 10 months ago, I decided to let my best friend move into my Apartment. To keep it short, he was in a crappy living situation and didn’t have a car. I was struggling with the bills. The original hope was to get him a job where I work so he could ride with me, help pay the bills, and save up for a car. After he moved in, I agreed to let him use my car to DoorDash while I was at work or not using it. That way he could have a way to contribute to the bills until he found a job.

Well he couldn’t get on where I was at, and I got laid off due to the auto strike anyway. So he was still door dashing while I searched for another full-time, while working a part-time. I found another full-time, and have been there nearly 4 months. He still doesn’t have a job. I’m tired of waiting on him to find one, and I’m tired of him being in my car all the time. So it boiled over into me making it clear I wanted him out.

From his perspective, I’m ungrateful because he’s been helping pay the bills. I was way behind on the light bill, and on a payment plan, so it was super high every month. We recently got it caught up and back to a normal price. 

It’s true he has helped with the bills, but there are still some issues to me. One, he was supposed to get an actual job. Door dashing with my car was only supposed to be temporary, but now he’s been here for 10 months and that’s still what’s been going on. Also, he’s not even paying his full portion of the rent because he can’t make enough door dashing to do so. He’s been extremely short some months. He’s made me late to work at least twice not having my car home in time. He’s also running a lot of miles up. My car needs an oil change every 3 or 4 weeks.

6,1cun15u,AITA for inviting my mom and grandma to my son's birthday?,"My mom hasn't spoken to my grandma for eleven years, there's a lot of background there but to sum up there's a lot of unresolved stuff between them. 

I hadn't spoken to my grandma for about five years following my wedding because of the awkwardness in the family and my moving out of state for a few years. Since the last time that we spoke, I've had three total children and possibly am expecting a fourth.   
For a little over a year now, I've been considering reaching out to my grandma and breaking the cycle of silence and awkwardness so that her and my grandpa can meet my kids and we can all reconnect. 

Because I know how my mom feels, I wanted to feel her out about the idea a few months ago. It ended about as well as I thought it would; she went off on me and kept me on the phone for eight and a half hours until she convinced me it wasn't a good idea and I should leave things as is.   
But I didn't feel great about it and still felt the desire to reconnect with my grandma.  


Some time went by and I discussed it with my husband more. I decided to also seek counsel from a reverend at our church in addition to a family friend who knows all the involved parties and a very close friend and neighbor of mine, just to get some different perspectives.   
Everyone came back with the same general idea, that I shouldn't allow my mom's feelings for my grandma to determine my actions and I should make my own decision.   
My grandma has a lot of health problems, so I also had to consider that time is not on my side in this. 

When I finally reached out to her, I was so happy. It was like no time had passed and we just seamlessly reconnected. My kids all adored her and my grandpa and it just felt wonderful. 

A detail that's important to the next part is the the birthdays in question go like this:  
April 29th : My daughter's birthday  
April 30th : My mom's birthday  
May 1st : My husband's birthday  
In the meantime, my mom and I have begun to grow more distant due to different other issues and things that are completely unrelated. Despite this, I had the kids all sign a birthday card for her and I also did one of my own and sent it out. Now, due to a really small disagreement we had that I thought ended amicably, my mom ignored my daughter's birthday. She didn't acknowledge her in any way, didn't ask to come over or send her a card or anything. She didn't even call just to say happy birthday. I thought it was so strange because she told me weeks before that she had bought her a birthday gift.  
The next day was my mom's birthday, I didn't text or call her because I sent her a card (this is something she knows I do - I don't like birthday texts if I can help it, I find cards more personal).   
The following day was my husband's birthday and he got a very flowery text from her with emojis and such.  
We were both a little annoyed that she went out of her way to ignore or daughter's birthday and then to acknowledge my husband's. Hours later, about halfway through the day, I got a text from her that she finally got the birthday card, but according to her only the one from the kids. It wasn't until two days later that she said she got the one I sent her. I really have no explanation for this because I put them in the mailbox at the same time.  


Now, during all this time, I had started planning my son's birthday party.   
He asked me for my parents to come, so I knew I would be inviting them.  
However, he also asked me for my grandparents (specifically my grandfather, who he adored right away) to come. I honestly did not think that my mother would come, I figured that after ignoring my daughter's birthday she would make an excuse not to come to my son's party, so I decided to invite all of them figuring maybe none of them would or could come and the more I invited the better chances my son had of having relatives at his party. 

I invited my grandparents first thinking that if they couldn't come I wouldn't even have to mention anything about inviting them to my mom so as not to start any problems unnecessarily before my son's birthday. My grandma said they would try to come, so I next texted my mom to invite her and let her know I invited my grandparents.   
If I hadn't told her, it would have been WW3 and at my son's birthday party no less. I felt like I really had to tell her. 

She started going off on me right away saying I had changed and she could tell I was talking to them for a while (which was not true at all, I had only recently just reached out to my grandma after five years long after a lot of our problems had started).  
The next day she sent me a long text talking about how betrayed she felt and how much I had hurt her and some other things.   
I tried asking her about why she ignored Jasmine's birthday and she told me she didn't feel ""safe"" reaching out to me and wondered why I didn't reach out to her. She also said she wasn't happy that we didn't have her party on a day that would be easier for her (we just do the kids parties on their actual birthday, we changed the date last year only because I was in the hospital but it still just happened that the last two years all the kids birthdays were on weekends). She even went out of her way to say that she treasured the card from the kids and then mentioned she also appreciated getting mine ""days later"".   
I replied to her and tried to respond to every single point she made, whether in agreement or refuting a little bit. I really wanted us to discuss things and talk it out, especially the mix up with her birthday cards because it really bothers me that they didn't arrive on the same day! But she just sent me a short response after ignoring everything I had said.   
A couple days later, she suddenly called me to talk to my daughter while she was down for a nap. Now, my daughter has a lot of trouble with naptime so there was no way I was waking her.   
My mom got on the phone with this really weird tone and started asking for her then got all strange when I told her she was down for a nap. My mom went on to ask me for details about her naptime and just made me feel kind of uncomfortable. I tried to tell her this but she cut me off and said she didn't want to talk about anything right now and got off the phone. 

After this, I told my mom that I needed a break for a while.  
I just have too much on my plate right now and emotions are way too high. This whole thing has been causing me a lot of stress and it hasn't been good for my marriage or my kids. She didn't even respond to what I said, I would have loved a little ""I understand"" or any kind of acknowledgment of my feelings, but maybe I should expect radio silence when I ask for space?

I've started to feel guilty for ever inviting my mom to the party to begin with. If I hadn't, things would be really awkward still but at least it wouldn't have exploded. I genuinely did not think she would come, so maybe I shouldn't have bothered?  Or maybe I shouldn't have invited my grandma? Maybe my mom actually would have come if I hadn't? But my son wanted both of them there, I don't know.",TL;DR,2024-05-18,"AITA for inviting my mom and grandma to my son's birthday? My mom hasn't spoken to my grandma for eleven years, there's a lot of background there but to sum up there's a lot of unresolved stuff between them. 

I hadn't spoken to my grandma for about five years following my wedding because of the awkwardness in the family and my moving out of state for a few years. Since the last time that we spoke, I've had three total children and possibly am expecting a fourth.   
For a little over a year now, I've been considering reaching out to my grandma and breaking the cycle of silence and awkwardness so that her and my grandpa can meet my kids and we can all reconnect. 

Because I know how my mom feels, I wanted to feel her out about the idea a few months ago. It ended about as well as I thought it would; she went off on me and kept me on the phone for eight and a half hours until she convinced me it wasn't a good idea and I should leave things as is.   
But I didn't feel great about it and still felt the desire to reconnect with my grandma.  


Some time went by and I discussed it with my husband more. I decided to also seek counsel from a reverend at our church in addition to a family friend who knows all the involved parties and a very close friend and neighbor of mine, just to get some different perspectives.   
Everyone came back with the same general idea, that I shouldn't allow my mom's feelings for my grandma to determine my actions and I should make my own decision.   
My grandma has a lot of health problems, so I also had to consider that time is not on my side in this. 

When I finally reached out to her, I was so happy. It was like no time had passed and we just seamlessly reconnected. My kids all adored her and my grandpa and it just felt wonderful. 

A detail that's important to the next part is the the birthdays in question go like this:  
April 29th : My daughter's birthday  
April 30th : My mom's birthday  
May 1st : My husband's birthday  
In the meantime, my mom and I have begun to grow more distant due to different other issues and things that are completely unrelated. Despite this, I had the kids all sign a birthday card for her and I also did one of my own and sent it out. Now, due to a really small disagreement we had that I thought ended amicably, my mom ignored my daughter's birthday. She didn't acknowledge her in any way, didn't ask to come over or send her a card or anything. She didn't even call just to say happy birthday. I thought it was so strange because she told me weeks before that she had bought her a birthday gift.  
The next day was my mom's birthday, I didn't text or call her because I sent her a card (this is something she knows I do - I don't like birthday texts if I can help it, I find cards more personal).   
The following day was my husband's birthday and he got a very flowery text from her with emojis and such.  
We were both a little annoyed that she went out of her way to ignore or daughter's birthday and then to acknowledge my husband's. Hours later, about halfway through the day, I got a text from her that she finally got the birthday card, but according to her only the one from the kids. It wasn't until two days later that she said she got the one I sent her. I really have no explanation for this because I put them in the mailbox at the same time.  


Now, during all this time, I had started planning my son's birthday party.   
He asked me for my parents to come, so I knew I would be inviting them.  
However, he also asked me for my grandparents (specifically my grandfather, who he adored right away) to come. I honestly did not think that my mother would come, I figured that after ignoring my daughter's birthday she would make an excuse not to come to my son's party, so I decided to invite all of them figuring maybe none of them would or could come and the more I invited the better chances my son had of having relatives at his party. 

I invited my grandparents first thinking that if they couldn't come I wouldn't even have to mention anything about inviting them to my mom so as not to start any problems unnecessarily before my son's birthday. My grandma said they would try to come, so I next texted my mom to invite her and let her know I invited my grandparents.   
If I hadn't told her, it would have been WW3 and at my son's birthday party no less. I felt like I really had to tell her. 

She started going off on me right away saying I had changed and she could tell I was talking to them for a while (which was not true at all, I had only recently just reached out to my grandma after five years long after a lot of our problems had started).  
The next day she sent me a long text talking about how betrayed she felt and how much I had hurt her and some other things.   
I tried asking her about why she ignored Jasmine's birthday and she told me she didn't feel ""safe"" reaching out to me and wondered why I didn't reach out to her. She also said she wasn't happy that we didn't have her party on a day that would be easier for her (we just do the kids parties on their actual birthday, we changed the date last year only because I was in the hospital but it still just happened that the last two years all the kids birthdays were on weekends). She even went out of her way to say that she treasured the card from the kids and then mentioned she also appreciated getting mine ""days later"".   
I replied to her and tried to respond to every single point she made, whether in agreement or refuting a little bit. I really wanted us to discuss things and talk it out, especially the mix up with her birthday cards because it really bothers me that they didn't arrive on the same day! But she just sent me a short response after ignoring everything I had said.   
A couple days later, she suddenly called me to talk to my daughter while she was down for a nap. Now, my daughter has a lot of trouble with naptime so there was no way I was waking her.   
My mom got on the phone with this really weird tone and started asking for her then got all strange when I told her she was down for a nap. My mom went on to ask me for details about her naptime and just made me feel kind of uncomfortable. I tried to tell her this but she cut me off and said she didn't want to talk about anything right now and got off the phone. 

After this, I told my mom that I needed a break for a while.  
I just have too much on my plate right now and emotions are way too high. This whole thing has been causing me a lot of stress and it hasn't been good for my marriage or my kids. She didn't even respond to what I said, I would have loved a little ""I understand"" or any kind of acknowledgment of my feelings, but maybe I should expect radio silence when I ask for space?

7,1cumq7o,AITA for making my mom change her wedding day? ,"I (20F) got engaged in Miami last year on June 27th. My wedding is planned for June 22nd, as the 27th is a weekday. Last night my mom (51F) called to tell me she had to tell me something before anyone else could. Shes also getting married, originally planning on getting married August 2025. She preceded to tell me she is moving up the wedding a whole year, to next month, the 27th. (For context, she met her fiancé the same day I got engaged, on the 27th.) 

I politely reminded her that that was the day I got engaged, (she was there) and told her that that day was special to me, regardless I don’t even approve of the guy she’s marrying, as they haven’t even known each other a full year. 

She assured me this wasn’t gonna be the “real” wedding and just for legal reasons. I asked her if she could move the day up to the 28th or 26th, just not the 27th. To which she responded “lots of things happen the same day” completely disregarding my feelings.

I ended up hanging up on her out of pure anger and blocked her on iMessages. I told her to fix the date or she will remain blocked. She texted me on instagram saying she didn’t mean to hurt my feelings, however she wasn’t planning on changing the date. 

I have concerns about her fiancé, who doesn’t have legal status in this country, I’ve even suspicious since day one about him. She also refuses to sign a prenup. 

She just texted me on instagram letting me know she had “hot gossip” to tell me. To which I said “get a husband and loose your daughter, or fix this.” She then told me the dates can’t be changed as plane tickets for her friends had already been booked and arranged. She said it was my choice to come to the wedding or not. Now I’m stunned, not only did she take my anniversary date, but went behind my back and arranged everything without my knowledge, her only child.

8,1cumoi4,AITA for Not Sticking Up for My Brother After My Boyfriend Called Him Out?,"I'm in a really tough spot and could use some perspective. I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend, Alex (31M), for about a year now. He’s been wonderful and supportive, especially through some difficult times. One of those difficult times involves my relationship with my older brother, Tom (33M).

Tom and I have always had a complicated relationship. Growing up, he was the golden child and I often felt like the family doormat. He would tease me mercilessly, make fun of my interests, and generally treat me like I was beneath him. Our parents rarely intervened, often brushing it off as typical sibling behavior or even enabling it by saying things like ""boys will be boys"" or ""he's just joking, don’t be so sensitive.""

This dynamic continued into adulthood. Tom still makes condescending comments, dismisses my achievements, and often expects me to drop everything to help him out, all without any gratitude or reciprocation. I've tried to talk to him about it before, but he just laughs it off or accuses me of overreacting.

For context, I work at a museum in our city, a job I’m really passionate about but Tom often belittles. He thinks it’s a waste of time and constantly tells me I could do something more “useful” with my life.

Last weekend, Alex and I were at a family gathering. Tom was in rare form, belittling me in front of everyone about my job. I was trying to brush it off as usual, but Alex wasn’t having it. He stepped in and told Tom to stop treating me like a doormat and to start respecting me as an equal.

Things escalated quickly. Tom got defensive and the situation turned into a heated argument. Alex called Tom out on all the times he’s treated me poorly and accused him of being a bully. Tom fired back, saying Alex didn’t know what he was talking about and should mind his own business. Our parents tried to diffuse the situation but ended up taking Tom's side, saying Alex was overstepping and causing unnecessary drama.

Now, Tom is furious with me. He says I should have stuck up for him and defended him against Alex. He claims that by not doing so, I’ve betrayed our family and humiliated him in front of everyone. My parents are also disappointed, feeling like I should have controlled the situation better.

Alex feels bad that things got so heated but stands by his actions, saying someone needed to finally call Tom out on his behavior. I’m torn. On one hand, I appreciate Alex standing up for me, but on the other hand, I feel guilty for not defending my brother in that moment.

AITA for not sticking up for my brother? Should I have done something to defuse this situation?

**ETA:** I wanted to add that part of why I didn’t defend Alex more strongly is because, whenever I did try to say something in his defense, my parents just bulldozed over me. Every time I tried to speak they'd yell over me, which brought back all the feelings of clamming up like I did when I was younger. It made me freeze up and just stand there, especially since it seemed to only make Tom even angrier. I felt trapped, not knowing how to diffuse the tension as it got worse and worse. I’m working on it but it's not easy, especially in situations like this. By the end of the entire thing I was just standing there crying and Alex took me to our car to go home. I've been fielding phone calls from my parents and brother since last weekend.

She and my uncle usually do step in to diffuse these situations when they're around but they were both in the kitchen when this happened.

9,1cumo3m,AITA for not considering my parents to be my parents?,"So me (14 F) my two little sisters now (12 F) and (10 F). a little context both of my parents have a very long history with drug abuse I mean like my mom has overdosed over like 20 times in the last 10 years and a very long criminal records and have gotten in trouble with CPS many many times and me and my sisters have been talked to by the social workers more times than we can count. So lets got back 6-7 years, everything was good for the most part and my dad (lets call him Jimmy and my mom Samantha for the stake of the post) and my sisters had this nice house where we all got our own rooms and we were living the american dream for the most part. But the only thing missing from my american dream was my mother, when my parents got divorced it was and actual shit show (Jimmy found out my mom Samantha was cheating on him). After my parents got a divorce nothing was the same ever again. (I know that sounds cheesy but it's the truth ). What I mean by that is that I didn't see my mom for over 2 years, whenever i would ask my dad if we could see our mom my dad would always reply with something along the lines of ""The reason your mom isn't here right now is because she doesn't want to be here."" Which to me and my sisters was absolutely heartbreaking for young kids to hear and so the more and more we would ask we started growing some sort of resentment of our mom and because of that we got a lot closer with Jimmy. (which now thinking about it he was a horrible parent but I'll get to that a bit farther down the post.) so lets fast forwards to about a year and a half ago when i was 12 my sisters were 8 and 10. We moved to a really small town with about 150-300 people there and we were living with our step-moms mom (our step-mom was an absolute sweetheart btw.)  So about two and a half weeks of living there the cops show up to our door and walk in saying that me and my sisters have 10 minutes to pack as many things as we can and we drove to our grandmas house which we didn't know were we were going until we got into the car with everything we could fit into our tiny backpacks and we looked horrible we smelt horrible our hair greasier than McDonald's fries with ragged hair cuts and with holes in our clothes and shoes with miserable looks on our faces. It was only then we were told what was going on we were getting but into out of home placement with out grandma. When we got pulled from our house CPS already had enough evidence to take us from Jimmy and Samantha so they could start a case on them. We found out we were going to court which it was then when we also found out what they were doing (they as in my dad, mom and my step-mom) after i found out how long they've been using I broke down and cried about how much i hated them because it opened my eyes to how much Jimmy and Samantha had abused us and how we never had an actual stable childhood and made me realize how many fucked up things Jimmy and Samantha had done to us for example: steal our money that we worked our asses of from our lemonade stand, would talk shit about each other, would go days on end without making us food, anytime they would get money instead of getting groceries they would buy hard drugs like meth and heroine even though our fridge was empty and pantry had nothing but breadcrumbs and sugar, I had to raise my younger siblings and my newborn baby brother and when I mean raise my siblings I mean i did everything that a mother would do like i cooked for everybody even when my parents had a full blown party i had to cook for them too, I also cleaned up after everyone, did every single persons laundry, and I know there is more those are just the main ones.

It only started to bother me a few weeks ago when she made comments that I looked like a man, looked big and just ugly cause I gained muscle from working out a lot. It sounds really bad but I just stopped going out with her. She later came to me asking why I never go with her anywhere, why I always look depressed, and that she's just getting embarrassed to be seen with me after work now, I just stayed quiet and didn't answer. She's mad at me now and won't talk to me. This was probably a stupid post but AITA?",0.0,0.00024431455,0,1
11,1cuml01,WIBTA for giving my child a similar name to my sibling's dead name?,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. 

My husband (23M) and I (22F) are expecting our first child in July, a girl. We're over the moon and couldn't be happier. 

We've both decided we want to name her Annette. My mom's (who I'm very close with) middle name is Anne, and my husband had a favorite teacher named Annette who made a really big impact on him. I think it's a super pretty, classic name, and it honors my mom. It's also one of the few names my husband and I could agree on. 

I have an eighteen-year-old sibling who is nonbinary, and I've always done my best to support them. I love them, even though we're not the closest, and I consider myself an ally. Their deadname (the name they were given at birth which they no longer use) is Anna. 

I saw them earlier tonight and they wanted to know if we'd decided on a name yet. I told them we loved the name Annette and were planning on using it, and they flipped out. They told me that it was way too similar to their deadname and it would be transphobic of me to name my daughter that. I explained that it's a variant of a family name, and how the intention was by no means meant to hurt them. My sibling wasn't having any of this, and told me that I was being an abusive narcissist. 

The name just feels *right* though, and my husband and I love it. I really don't see all that much similarity between the names, except that they both start with ""An"". They're even pronounced differently (""uh-NET"" vs ""AN-a"" with a hard ""a""). If it would be transphobic to use the name though, I don't want to use it.

13,1cumbi4,AITA for telling my Mom that I’m angry with her because she gave away my inheritance. ,"My(32f) grandma(83f) has been showing signs of dementia and is in poor health because of a recent fall and arm break. My Mom (61f) is in the process of getting her moved out of her house and into a nursing home where she will have supervision and a better quality of life. This means downsizing and selling a lot of her things. My grandma is an avid sewer and crafter and because I’m the only person in the family who enjoys sewing and really appreciates her craft and skill in quilting I inherited all of her sewing stuff. I took all of the pieces that she had already started working on and some good basic fabric that I can use to make a few quilts and also a bunch of tools that I can use like scissors, needles, thread etc. the rest (and there’s a lot of it) I left for my mom to sell at a garage sale that will help pay for her nursing home and general expenses. I offered to organize the fabric that I didn’t take  into different categories so it could be more easily priced and sold. My mom said not to bother, that it would all get handled. Today was the first day of the garage sale. My mom just texted me and said they’ve made over $1000 in the first day and they’re pretty happy with that. I asked her if she sold any of the fabric yet and she told me that they were giving the fabric away to anyone who wanted it because “that’s what she would have wanted”. I feel completely and utterly betrayed by this. Not because I want the fabric, but because it feels like they aren’t valuing this huge lifetime passion that she had. Giving it all away for free feels so incredibly disrespectful to both me and her that I am breathtakingly angry right now and told my mom as much. I don’t know if I can even be friendly to someone who disrespects the passion of a loved one and who so fundamentally doesn’t understand where I’m coming from. Am I being a crazy asshole? I know that anger can be a part of the grief process and everyone grieves differently but this already feels like something that I will never forgive her for. Are there any quilters or crafters out there who understand what I mean? Am a just grieving and letting my emotions get the better of me or is this completely heartless behavior? I feel completely powerless to stop any of this. 

Update: To answer some confusion that people have: 
I don’t have unrealistic expectations about how garage sales work. I wasn’t expecting to get top dollar for any of the fabric, nor is it bad old fabric that’s been improperly stored. This is all good fabric that I wanted people to be able to use as I could not take all of it. It’s not that it was given away because it wasn’t appealing to buyers. 

I am not mad that people took it. I’m mad she isn’t being compensated. 

I’m mad that my mom GAVE IT AWAY at a garage sale. I left it in the expectation that my mom would sell it for SOME amount of money even if it was well below the market value. 
I offered to price all of it, and organize it so that she didn’t have to because I knew she didn’t appreciate sewing. She refused my help and said that she would take care of it. I left a lot of really good prices knowing that they could sell and that proceeds would go to my grandma. 

My mom is well off and is not struggling financially at all. She will also be renting out my grandmas house which will almost entirely cover the cost of the nursing home. 

Some people have said it’s my fault for not taking it, and I agree with that at this point. If I had known she was going to give it away to strangers I definitely would have taken all of it and sold it myself or even passed some of it to other people in her life who know her and are quilters. It feels flippant and callous to just give it away to strangers. I was under the impression that 1) SOME money would be going to my grandma, as is fitting and 2) people would still be getting a good deal on some nice fabric. People were very happy to get free fabric and I can’t blame them. My Grandma was never really appreciated for her skills and was a very humble and kind person. And you know what, she probably would be totally happy to just give all of her stuff away which is why I’m irate that she isn’t being compensated at all. She should get some of what she deserves for the value of her things ESPECIALLY because it was things associated with her passion and art the way she expressed herself. It feels morally wrong.

Since 2021 he's been seeing different women, calling them ""friends"" to avoid me finding out about them. I found this out recently because at a party here in my new city I met some former interns from his office who told me ""yeah you know he's been seeing J, then P, but he seems serious about this T one"" and were stunned I didn't know. I played it cool and let them describe the situation. Soon after, the same T woman called me (dad gave her my number), and left a voicemail for me to ""call me back baby, bye!"" I never did. She then texted me several texts, including photos of them together on a date and her inside the family farm admiring the place. I didn't respond. Finally on superbowl, dad says ""here you wanna talk to my friend?"" and I said fine thinking it was a guy. It was T; so I just asked her ""why are you harassing me with calls/texts/voicemails?"" She refused to really answer, stammering like ""i uh, I don't do voicemails"" so I texted her the voicemail transcript, and blocked her after she didn't respond within 3 days.

Yes I probably sound immature. My thing is to me it's disrespectful to not say ""I am dating now for a permanent partner"" instead of doing it (I lived at home after mom died so there were times I was stuck with the animals while he was off having fun) and then having this T woman happily serve as the introduction person.

I now feel some guilt, my Husband has told me if I want to make me feel better he'll give her money but that seems like a bad idea as she'd likely use it badly or blow through it then expect more.

We have allowed My Mother one supervised visit per month so she's not totally cut off from my sister but it was during these visits things went badly as she saw how she was dressed and the toys she had, and realised they were expensive. She began to rip into us for hiding the fact we have money and how if we'd just given her money she'd have not given us my sister as she could have taken care of her better.

I told her while we have some money its mostly my husbands parents money not ours so she had no right to know about it, also that I wouldn't have given her money anyway as I didn't trust her. She broke down calling me a selfish bitch who'd never considered how hard things were for her.

I now feel some guilt, my Husband has told me if I want to make me feel better he'll give her money but that seems like a bad idea as she'd likely use it badly or blow through it then expect more. Despite this though I do feel bad, maybe I should have tried to help her more now my luck is better, or maybe I should have been honest with her. AITA for keeping this from her?",0.0,0.025230352,0,1
18,1cuke86,AITA for not traveling for my father-in-laws 60th birthday party?,"My wife and I live in Boston, while my in-laws live in Houston.  My father in law is turning 60 next month, so my wife decided to book a flight to Houston for the weekend to attend the party. 

We have a dog… so between my plane ticket and finding a pet sitter that would have added $500 to our expenses. 

We are expecting our first child in September, and we play $1,300/month in student loans, so needless to say we are on a tight budget. 

We also will be seeing them the weekend before the party, and a couple of weeks after the party.  So all this factored in our decision for me to stay back in Boston. 

My wife was one the phone with her mom (my MIL) today and her mom asked “Is there a reason your husband is not coming home for your dads 60th bday?”  She went on to say that her dad’s feelings are hurt by our decision.

19,1cuk86l,AITA for prioritising my job over my grandma’s birthday?,"So, I’m(30F) pretty much estranged from my dad’s side of the family. Bar a few family members, I don’t even feel like a member of that side of my family, through no fault of my own (so much so I legally changed my surname). 

My grandma (who has favourited my older cousin my entire life) has been ill a couple of times this year and has ended up in hospital, and with her 80th birthday coming up, some family members have been concerned. 

As much of a black sheep she has made me feel my entire life and how judgemental she is of me, she’s my grandma and I do genuinely love and care about her. So, for a few weeks I kept in touch with her, asking her how she is and if I would be okay to come and visit. She kept telling me she wasn’t up to visitors, even though the rest of my family are welcome to come and go as they please, so eventually I gave up asking. 

As my grandma is turning 80, a family meal has been arranged. I have work on the day of the meal but the original time of the meal left me with plenty of time to get ready and get there after my shift. However, my aunt decided the original time was too late and decided to go ahead and change the booking to an earlier time without checking that everyone would still be able to attend. 

I explained that I have work that day and that the new time just wouldn’t be enough time for me to get ready and get to the restaurant (as I live a 45 minute drive away from the restaurant too) and I was met with a bombard of messages telling me to fake being sick or use a holiday day because “it’s not everyday your grandma turns 80”. I’d love to be able to attend, not only for my grandma but it would be the first time I’d be introducing my grandparents to my partner, but I have no holidays left for this year and I don’t feel right about pretending to be sick just so I can go to a meal. They’re acting like I just don’t care or want to see her even though I’ve reached out and asked to visit numerous times.

20,1cuk4of,AITA for wanting to wear my own outfit to graduation?,"I'm 17, currently graduating my Senior year of highschool.

I came out as trans to my parents about 2 years ago now, back when I was a Sophomore (I’d known for longer). I've completely regretted it ever since and went back into the closet, I just tell my parents I'm a masculine woman and I was confused. A lot happened and I've been called a lot of names (slurs) by both of my parents, mainly my mother. She's done that long before I came out to her though because of my choice of style. She's said some incredibly hurtful things to me outside of the name calling like how she wishes she never had me, that I'm a failure/disappointment, ""what would your grandparents think??"" etc specifically because of how I dress.

Finding a way that I like to dress that makes me more comfortable has changed a lot for me and it's really helped me with self-image issues I’d had. I know my parents don't see it this way, and I know it's upsetting to them but I just feel terrible whenever I'm forced to wear dresses, outfits that show cleavage, or other just generally girly things not by choice. I've tried to make compromises with my mom about dressier pants, blouses, and so on but she always says that I'm doing it to spite her or upset her intentionally. She calls me a dyke, a carpet muncher, says that she's ashamed of me, ""why can't you just be like other girls / Other girls don't dress like this,"" idk she just gets mean about it? Why would you say these kinds of things to your own kid?? I've tried explaining to her that it's a style I like and that wearing girly things makes me feel uncomfortable but she always dismisses it by saying I used to wear those kinds of things all the time.

For graduation, I'd sat down with my mom to look at outfits and she went over a lot of the usual things that tended to be revealing, or things she knows I don't like but wants me to wear anyways, so I try to compromise. I picked out something that she and I both liked which was overall shorts with a white shirt underneath. She ended up not ordering it, saying that I was ""indecisive"" when I'd been pretty clear that I liked it and she seemingly did too, but now it's too late and it won't be here on time, so she's trying to force me to go out and buy a dress or something else with her. I tried to convince her to let me wear a blouse and nice pants but she blowed up and it turned into a big argument. She said I'm ""selfish and don't care about anyone's feelings but my own” for not wearing something that practically has my tits hanging out, which I am NOT comfortable with.

Am I the asshole for wanting to wear something I'm comfortable in for graduation? I know I can only see from my own perspective and I am not asking for advice. I wanted to hear the thoughts of others on this, I've been struggling a lot with if I'm being an unreasonable prick or not??  ",Not the A-hole POO Mode,2024-05-18,"AITA for wanting to wear my own outfit to graduation?

21,1cuk4g8,WIBTA if I don't tell my step mom I'm pregnant before I move 7 hours away?,"Okay so let me just start out with a little background. Me and my step mom have never had the best relationship. It's been okay at it best and abusive at its worst. She prefers boys. If I do anything wrong I never hear the end of it. She still talks about the stuff I did when I was 15. I am now 21. Stuff I did at 15- 17 included:
At 15 -Sneaking out and going to the speedway for snacks or to see my boyfriend at the time. (Admittedly I also called police on myself when I over slept one night and it turned into a huge mess. But again 15 year old stupidity. After that I didn't do anything but every once and while sneak onto the deck at night and listen to the crickets and stuff at night).At 16 -I would sometimes accidentally sleep through my baby nieces crying on the monitor and my step mom would have to get them. 
I wasn't keep good grades
I forgot to take my medicine some times.I got caught vaping at school (big thing that was happening when I was in high-school.I kept hiding food and wrappers in my room, drawing bugs.Ran away bc I was called stupid, a fa**ot, and a bitch when I came out as bi/pansexual for a few months by my adoptive dad
At 17 i left home for good. 
I got tired bc through all of that I was never given a chance to redeem or earn trust bc and i quote ""i dont deserve a chance bc i would just let them down. Id go months without doing anything wrong. She would dangle my tv, book reading, or even outside privileges in my face saying ""if your good for 1 more week your punishment will be over"". Only to get mad that I did something small like forget wipe down a shelf while dusting or if i got a 75 on a school paper. Stating i wasn't trying my hardest and why couldn't be more like my older brother (my bio brother who was a year older then me, not my step brother) I couldn't do anything right in her eyes so I decided that if I was going to get in trouble no matter what I did or how good I would be then I was just going to stop caring what she thought. So yeah I was the best kid, but I have gotten better. I have my own place now with my son and fiance, a stable job, and I of course have calmed down. Unfortuantly where I'm living has become too expensive and crazy so we have decided to move to another state that is cheaper and also closer to my fiancé's family who has only seen my son once. We think it'll be a fresh start. Exactly what we need. However last year thing between me and my fiance wasn't as good and resulted in me and my son going to back home to take some time apart from each other and figure things out. In the 5 months we were there a lot happened. Mostly my step mom almost  manipulating me into cutting my fiance out of my son's life completely and going with another guy she liked. She would tell me since we were under her roof she had a say in what happened and who could take my son.I was such a mess that I almost let it happen until my fiance woke me up to what was actually happening.
