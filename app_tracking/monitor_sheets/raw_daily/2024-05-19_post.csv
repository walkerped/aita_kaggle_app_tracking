0,1cvriig,WIBTA if I didn't let my (18TF) sister live in my apartment with me?,"About a month ago, my mom asked my younger sibling to let my sister live with them in their 1 bedroom apt and work down there to get some job experience.They said they couldn't cause their friend was already living with them as well as their combined 1 dog and 2 cats. So it deferred to me. I asked why they wanted her out the house so bad and it turned out my stepfather was coming home on leave then retirement in July/Aug. 

Now, my stepfather is a piece of shit. He verbally abuses my mother, my sibling and myself and physically abused my sister due to her being ""a problem child"" in my highschool years. Things such as Military PT, standing in a corner for 5+hours, and writing over 100 pages front to back of lines. My sibling and I also got some of this but nothing as bad as my sister. My sister reasonably is terrified of this man and the few times he's come to visit, she refuses to leave her room and will wait til he's asleep or out the house to even grab food and drinks. 

He is not aware that she is trans (most of our family doesn't know) but she's grown out her hair and dresses a bit more feminine when she feels comfortable. My stepfather is a highly conservative person who on several occasions has said my mom is a terrible mother cause all her children are gay/trans/nonbinary and it was somehow her fault. 

Now to the part that might make me the asshole, I haven't said no yet but I'm worried about a few things.

1.  My sister can not drive so she can't get herself to work, (The town we live in is mostly highways and since she's autistic and highly antisocial, working at the restaurant closest to our house isn't the best option) so we would have to drive her.

2. We would have to choose between a living space and our gaming setups. We chose this space due to the amount of stuff we have and to have a comfortable space to live in. Having to get rid of my art workspace in the dining room area or his vr setup to give the other room to my sister seems unfair to us. 

I feel like we are unreasonably having to compromise our comfortability for my mom to stay with a shitty human being. We have talked with her on multiple occasions asking why, if she knows that man makes her children uncomfortable, is she willing to stay with him? Her response is always that she still loves him or he isn't that bad or ""[Sister] can just such it up"". I want to make it clear if anything happened to my sister while he was there I would immediately go get her to let her crash at my place for a bit. I never want her to be unsafe.

I don't really have any friends due to moving around alot and everyone I know is emotionally invested in this conflict. I have been told I'm being selfish and an asshole for not immediately saying yes and moving her in right away. But I'm also being told it isn't my responsibility to take care of my sister, it's my mom's responsibility. 

Please any advice will be greatly appreciated. AITA?

1,1cvqgmg,UPDATE: AITA for deliberately misunderstanding my baby's father?,"so it turns out he’s got deep-seated resentment for me lol.

he resents me for:

earning more money than him

being further in my career than he is

not losing my job during covid like he did

having parents who love and support me

not being a submissive woman (lol)

having a present and loving father

not combining our finances thus making him feel small

so when i last came here, i said i’d asked him to come home and discuss our future with baby, preferably in the presence of a neutral party. he left me on read for a few days though i could see he was spying on us through the ring door bell and baby’s monitor. i disconnected them both and he finally responded 🫠

he came home very irate and rejected my offer to have a neutral facilitator for the conversation. i asked how we're supposed to move forward and the rant above came out in a full mask off moment. any hope i had that you guys were wrong about him died that day.

he again rejected the offer to hyphenate baby’s surname. apparently i’m ‘disrespectful’ and ‘insolent’ for refusing to ‘do what’s right’ and give baby their ‘rightful’ surname. i told him i won’t go through the administrative nightmare of having a different surname to my child, and lots of data shows a double barrelled surname is social currency that has positive connotations. nope - he wouldn’t budge. i told him neither would i - baby either has both our surnames or mine alone.

he asked if this was a hill i wanted this relationship to end on, if i was prepared to throw half a decade down the drain over my ‘silly little feminism’. i told him i wasn’t sure there was anything left to fight for. we broke up. thankfully, our - in his name - lease expires end of may. i called my dad and he came to help me back up baby.

i messaged him to suggest we still need couple’s counselling: we need to learn to be co-parents and they can help us establish a healthy way of doing that. he again said no to that so

my mum wanted to take me and baby on a baby moon holiday after this stressful period but he would grant permission for me to take baby abroad :)))))))

it’s going to be a long road ahead. i’ve instructed a lawyer to help us set up a formal agreement to avoid this in the future. he’s not responding to correspondance from the lawyer so that’s fun. he’s sulking - used to do this a lot when things didn’t go his way. i hope he’ll soon realise i no longer have time for his bs and i won’t be toyed with because i called his bluff and ended the relationship

to end on a bright note, the house i wanted us to buy a couple of years ago - which he talked me out of until he was back on his feet again despite us being able to afford it on my salary alone - is back on the market! i took it as fate: it’s time to move on from this man! it’s a beautiful Victorian terrace near good schools, good transport links, a small garden and close to my parents. it’d be the perfect home for baby and i. i put in an offer in - wish me luck!",UPDATE,2024-05-19,"UPDATE: AITA for deliberately misunderstanding my baby's father? so it turns out he’s got deep-seated resentment for me lol.

2,1cvedmx,WIBTAH if I distanced myself from my best friend over these things?  ,"I (28F) am conflicted because I don’t know if my best friend (29F) is a bad friend or if this is just a ME problem. My family’s restaurant of 25 years recently got shut down and I’m afraid I may just be going through a rough time. But also, so much of what she does triggers me. Please be honest. 
——-

I met my friend Sarah in martial arts class when we were both 20 and we connected immediately. We were the type of friends that didn’t really hang out much outside of class, but whenever we did get together it awesome! She was like the first and only irl friend I made in my 20s and we both call each other “best friend” since we met. 

Recently, I’ve felt like I no longer want to see her. I first felt this about 2 years ago when her other friends and I were helping her move. Sarah got pregnant when she was 23 and I didn’t find out until she was 8 months in and planning a baby shower. She said she didn’t tell me about it because she didn’t want anyone in our martial arts group to know and wanted to keep it secret. Understood. During the move though, I witnessed her other girl friends reminiscing with her about how excited they felt when she told them about her pregnancy. They were showing off the ultrasound photos and everything. This stung a bit.

I had a falling out with another girl friend of mine  back in 2019. I was the one that introduced Sarah to her. I unfortunately learned that my past friend was talking about me and my family behind my back. Sarah still hangs out with her to this day despite that and they travel/post Instagram pics together. I’ve explained to Sarah how that friend basically ghosted me and is out here talking about me. I just recently found out that friend is the SAME person that was there when Sarah gave birth. I don’t see their friendship changing anytime soon.

My family’s restaurant is vegetarian. We were struggling to stay open this past year, and I’d see Sarah posting pics of herself eating at other vegetarian restaurants in the area. People are free to eat where they choose, but I must admit I was upset since she could’ve supported my family’s restaurant instead. My family even offered her a place in our restaurant to put up her crochet designs when she first got started with her business. Sarah has text me about going to eat at other vegetarian restaurants and in the back of my mind I’m thinking, “Are you dense… first off my family and I are struggling for money here! I can’t even afford to go out and secondly why would I want to support competition?” This pissed me off. 

Fast forward 2024. When Sarah and I hang out these days, it’s mostly because she needs my advice on a guy/needs to vent. I don’t mind this as I love giving advice to those in need, but I just want the same support system for myself, especially during this rough time. She allows me space to vent, but I just don’t feel fulfilled after our convos, more drained. When we text there are so many misunderstandings. All these little things I wrote about above are getting to me and I just want to stop connecting with her. Do you think I’m being dramatic? Would I be an a*hole if I brought up all this stuff to her first?

So me and my cousins were going out to get ice cream for us and our parents. Im the youngest in my family ( 18M) with cousins that are in the mid twenties and older. They usually pay for most of the things as I don't have a job and are like my older siblings in a way. Obviously, I didn't want to just sit there and let them pay for mine so I offered to pay for mine and my parents ice cream ( in other words, dutch ).  I got scolded at by not offering to pay for everyones pretty harshly, even being called selfish,  and I feel very bad about it. I didn't do it because I just wanted to be nice, I did it because it was the right thing to do, or so I thought. Like I said, I know theres not much to go off of, but I really just wanted to know if Im the asshole for not paying for everyone. Sorry if it's a dumb post, I just need to know so I can make better decisions in the future.

5,1cve518,AITA because I don't want to split the electricity bill 50/50 with my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend and I have been living together for 2 years. We rent a two bedroom apartment. We both travel a lot for work and there are some weeks where its just me and some weeks where its just him. When it comes to money, I am definitely more cautious. I budget my money and am careful with my purchases because I am trying to build up my savings to buy a house. My boyfriend is more relaxed with his money and doesn't think about budget or how much credit card debt he is in. 

 In the beginning of us living together, we were splitting the bills equally. But as months went by, I noticed a big fluctuation between months where I was home more and when he was home more. The bill was about $100-$150 higher when he was at home more. He typically will leave things on like the tv, lights, computer, etc. All day and night. When we are both home, I'm usually turning things off when he's not using them. So without me to turn them off, the bill racked up.

 He also leaves the windows open while the AC or Heat is on. He says its because he likes the fresh air but doesnt want the apartment to get too hot/cold. I've told him many times that it racks up the electricity bill and could potentially break the system, leaving us with no AC or heat and probably having to pay to fix it. He then offered to pay the whole bill himself to end me nagging him about it. 

Thats been our arrangement for the last year. Last December, I got a new job and am now working from home. He still leaves everything on and runs the AC with the windows open. A couple of weeks ago, he said he wanted to talk about the bills. He said that its not fair he still has to pay the whole electricty bill when I am home all the time. 

I explained that we had data that proved that even when its just me, I still use half as much as him. I told him I would be happy to pay 70/30 but wouldn't do 50/50 because its not fair to me that he wants to be wasteful. He said I was being petty and that couples should split things 50/50.

6,1cve3ry,AITA for Trying to Change my Fathers Hoarding Problem?,"
This has been absolutely draining my energy for years but i believe its for a higher purpose. 


Background: Im in my 20s living with father and every single year, I clean the garage, the shed, the basement, with the goal of becoming 1% more functional then yesterday. I do this when im not working hard in school, on my time off. I also buy and resell on the side. 

Problem: However, its not my house. Its my fathers. But he collects junk, literally stuff thats not valuable, with no absolute meaning. Its a 3 story house and he is not poor, hes like middle class, works 50 hours a week. But thats his excuse for everything.

Background: Im in my 20s living with father and every single year, I clean the garage, the shed, the basement, with the goal of becoming 1% more functional then yesterday. I do this when im not working hard in school, on my time off. I also buy and resell on the side. 

Problem: However, its not my house. Its my fathers. But he collects junk, literally stuff thats not valuable, with no absolute meaning. Its a 3 story house and he is not poor, hes like middle class, works 50 hours a week. But thats his excuse for everything.

7,1cve36y,WIBTA for contacting my ex’s job about a personal conflict?,"WIBTA for contacting my ex’s job about a personal conflict? First, for a long backstory. My ex, lets call him L (19m) and I (18f) were talking again recently in an attempt to reconnect, which was my first mistake. I asked if he still had feelings for me and in return, I was told to “fuck off” and other things I can’t say here.

About a month later, he said he did some thinking and would like to meet for lunch to discuss things. I agreed, although i knew it would probably end poorly. We met and talked about how things have been going for each of us, and I did tell him that what he said made me lose whatever I felt for him almost instantly. He seemed to kind of accept that and move on.

Over the past three months, we were talking like friends, and occasionally he would say things that would hint at us being more than friends again (I know, big mistake on my part). It was an inevitable conversation that needed to be had. Eventually, just a couple weeks ago now, I asked to meet for lunch again and told him that I didn’t think we should be in a romantic relationship. “Between me starting college in the fall, his lack of commitment to travel, and just an overall lack of similarity in what we wanted for our lives,” is what I told him. I also mentioned that made me uncomfortable that he was telling strangers online about me, which is similar to something he did when we first dated.

Later, he sent me a long line of voice messages of him screaming about how I led him on and that he knew I would do this to him, which is fair on his part to a point, but I had specifically told him that I didn’t feel romantic interest in him anymore from when we first met up for lunch because of what he said to me.

Additionally, if it gives any context to his character, he ranted to my friend to other day about how so many women could show up at any point and genuinely ruin his life. So, that’s another clue and massive red flag as to what I’m dealing with.

Now, my ex and I used to work in the kitchen of a healthcare facility down the road from the high school we both attended. I quit in June of 2023 because I was moving, but he continues to work there and has told me multiple times that he’s considered staying there for a while. Recently, I found out he is telling residents during mealtime, while on the clock, obscenely warped versions of what happened while painting me in an awful light. He is using this to fuel his argument that “I am wrong and he is right”.

Since I still know the manager, I was thinking of emailing or going in person to ask them to ask him to stop. Something non-specific along the lines of, “Please keep out-of-work matters outside of work and away from the residents while on the clock”.

I (M15) have been friends with Amelia (F14) for 3 year. We met during online school in 2021 and exchanged discords. At this time, I was told her father had just passed due to the virus and, being one of the few people Amelia talked to at the time, I was sort of her crutch.

Because we go to schools so close to each other, we have some mutual friends that go to either of our schools. Most of these friends we met after online school, in 7th grade. I was talking with a few of our friends and Amelia came up in the conversation. One of our friends mentioned making plans with her and Amelia telling them that their dad doesn't let her hang out with people on week days. I got confused and asked if they meant her mom or her granddad but they doubled down and assured me that Amelia had said her *father* said no. I informed them that Amelias father had passed over covid and another friend chimed in, saying they had met her father, alive and well.

I went home that night and scrolled through me and Amelias texts, making sure that I wasn't making the whole thing up in my head.

I tell her that i'm not trying to drive too far away from the school because I would have to pick up my younger brother later. she leaves. I'm hungry. i ask my guy friend to go grab something to eat 10 minutes away. she has my location. she knows i hung out with him. shes mad.

I told him that I’m sorry she did that to him but they both have been my friend for about the same amount of time and I am trying to understand both sides. AITA?

I try to ignore it but sometimes it feels like I’m the host who plans everything without any help.

I have diagnosed autism and it has impacted my relationships/ friendships all my life since I find gatherings extremely overwhelming.

So technically there was a fair in town and we were all planning to go but they suddenly had no money and were expecting me to pay so I wanted to try something and told them I also had no money since I noticed I paid for everything.

I wasn’t upset or anything but I was annoyed that they decided to send a picture to me like it was rubbing it in my face.

I did try and talk to R about it and she got upset at me and angry at me because I was annoyed and she started accusing me of stuff. That’s what made me angry and I told her I don’t want to be friends with them anymore. Was I overreacting?

16,1cvcvlr,"AITA for Yelling at My Parents to ""Get It Together"" About Their Dirty House?","I (M22) recently graduated from college.  I’ve spent the last few weeks living back with my parents while I figure out career stuff.  They’ve been kind enough to let me live here rent free for at least the next few months.  It’s been an admittedly difficult transition.  I’ve caught myself being moody, snapping at them like a teenager.  

The problem comes from the house itself.  It’s completely falling apart. 

It’s a big two-story that they would never have been able to afford if it hadn’t been sold “as is”. And “is” is filled with rot and pests, and it seems like nothing is being done about it.  I knew it was a little dirty when I grew up, but I don’t think I realized how bad it was until I moved back.  There’s a lot wrong, but I’ll condense.  

We have mice.  They refuse to get an exterminator because they’re worried about our two small dogs getting sick.  We’ve resorted to dozens of small traps, but the mice have learned to avoid them.  They’ve gotten into every room at this point.  I’ve found mouse droppings IN THE STOVE.  

The house, and especially the bathrooms, are filled with mold.  Every time I visited for Christmas or summer, I’d bring it up, clean it while I was there, and when I came back it would be right back to where it was.  The shower grout is absolutely coated in black.  I had to beg my mother to buy a new shower curtain liner - the old one was knee high stained in mold spots.  

My final straw was when I was cleaning out my bedroom closet.  A box full of some of my stuff had been chewed through and destroyed by the mice.  It had some things that were sentimental AND a few things that were monetarily valuable that I’d bought with my own money.  They’d made a nest out of it.  The box and surrounding floor were covered in mouse droppings.  

I stopped myself from storming to my parents but as soon as I saw them later that day, I started yelling and crying.  I don’t remember the exact specifics, but I’d sum it up as such:

“The mold and mouse situation is absolutely fucking absurd.”

Dad: “You are always so judgemental, you always have something to say when you visit”

 “Maybe I’d have less to say if you took care of it.”

Dad: “You’re one to talk.  You’re not exactly Mr. Clean”

“I’m 22.  I’m not the one who bought a house I couldn’t take care of. My shit was destroyed”

Dad: “It’s really not that big of a deal. We’re taking care of it”

“You should fucking pull it together for once.  If you think this is ""taking care of it"".  Fucking insane!”

There was some more yelling.  I slammed a door like a child.  I haven’t really talked to them in the past few days.  I was talking to my brother earlier and he mentioned I was “kind of a dick”, and I’m conflicted.  It’s not my house but it’s just been concerning me.  I’m worried about my and my parents' health.

So, Am I The Asshole?

I told her that I understand that she is upset but that I was as well for the way she handled the wedding. I wasn't acknowledged as her dad during the wedding at all.

Her Mother and mother's Husband was acknowledged as parents of the bride, and gave the welcome speech before dinner. I initially got up to give the speech, but sat back down when I realized her mother's husband was doing it. That was honestly the moment that hurt me the most and I decided to leave before dinner. 

I gave my daughter a hug before leaving and told her that I wasn't feeling well and was going home to lay down. She seemed okay with me leaving. I called her the next morning to let her know that I was deeply hurt by her and that she should have reached out so I could have been more involved. I wanted her to understand how her being my only child, that those moments that ive now missed should have been special.

18,1cvcfmo,AITA for not allowing my gfs 65 y/o dad stay in our 1 bdr appt for 2-3 weeks when he comes to visit?,"
My (36M) FIL comes to stay with my partner (35F) and I every year for about 2-3 weeks, and this year I have asked for the trip to be shorter, after this years visit I’m at the point where I am over the whole thing.

Our families live half way across the country but my folks understand that it would be too tight to stay in our space so they stay somewhere else when they come. We go back to where we are from a few times a year so it’s not that we don’t see our families.

It’s a small apartment and I feel like it does not seat 3 people comfortably. Especially when the living room has an air mattress taking up 2/3 of the space.

I love the guy but I’ve always known he’s a little out of touch with social interactions and loves to make himself personally comfortable in any space he’s in. We live in a beautiful city but he seems to have little interest in checking things out and will relay on us to tour him around. Sure we get a few free sit down meals that I am thankful for so I guess this is life with the in-laws.

I feel like it can be manageable as I work longer hours and am not home the majority of the time but it feels like more social work when I get home. My partner is a people pleaser and I feel she has a tough time asking for the trips to be shorter.

I don’t feel like it is my place to put the boundaries around this but I feel like she doesn’t have courage to confront this situation.

19,1cvcac5,WIBTA if i told my mom she doesnt deserve a car because she scammed it from me? ,"I (23M) decided to take a bank loan to buy a car. It was a big step for me, and I was both nervous and excited about the decision. I asked my mom for help because she's more knowledgeable about these matters. However, she's quite particular—if she's not reminded to do something, she won't do it, and if you remind her too often, she feels pressured.

She advised me not to buy the first car I saw or to make a purchase out of desperation. She also warned against buying a car that was just 'okay.' I was adamant about using only my money because I wanted the car to be solely mine and to avoid any potential arguments with her over financial contributions.

Despite this, my mom took out a loan to help me get a 'nicer' car, even though I had used part of my loan for other expenses. I reluctantly agreed to her help under the condition that it wouldn't lead to any arguments. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened after we got the car.

She also insisted on looking for trucks, claiming I would look 'dumb' getting out of a small car due to my height—I'm 6 feet tall. I didn't agree with her reasoning and continued to send her recommendations for small cars.

To my surprise, she bought a car without my input—the only one she had contacted—and based on her friend's opinion that 'the motor looked nice.' This broke both rules she had set. When she picked me up from work with the car, I immediately noticed several issues: a cracked front window, only two functioning windows, a missing door handle, weak lights, and faulty wipers. Later, we discovered the car leaked and had overheating problems.

The repairs were costly, and my mom had to take out a second loan. This led to a fight because it was the exact situation I wanted to avoid. The car has continued to deteriorate and become more expensive to maintain. Now, my mom complains about the car's condition and claims it's practically hers because she's investing in the repairs, even though the car is registered in my name.

Everytime my mom mentions any issues with the car i tell her to please cut it short bc i'm not comfortable with hesring anything else the car needs to get fixed (the fact i'm going through a heavy depressive episode is not helping either), but i feel one day if she keeps up with this i'll blow up and tell her that is all her fault and that she cost me a nice car i could take care of myself, and that it seems like all she did was scam me out of my money, convince me to take a loan, all for her to mess up big time for something is now not even mine bc all she'll do is gaslight me into just surrendering the car to her.

I understand she's the one that at the end have been investing the most into the car so she'd be right to say that, but i'm not kidding... I feel scammed out of it and i'm tired to not even feel ownership of something i so desperately wanted.

21,1cvbzyq,AITA for trying to separating my phone plan from my best friend?,"
TL/DR: Best friend of 3 years keeps making the mistake of paying her bill late. This time making my phones get shut off and me owing 160 just to turn them back on. I cannot help her and cannot risk it again, so I am requesting her to make her own account but she is refusing to accept. AITA? An AITA for continuing to inquire when she will accept the transfer?



Little back story. Bestfriend of 3 years. I added her to my phone plan to save money for both of us. I over these last 2 years have helped her out 9/10 every month by covering her phone bill so she had a couple of day extra to get the money to me. Never didn’t pay me except 1 time and gave her the benefit of the doubt when she said it wouldn’t happen again. 

Last September my life flipped upside down. Lost my house, found out I was pregnant, and was screwed over by the person who tried to give me a place to live after the fact. Due to to my pregnancy I can no longer work being high risk making our income a one person income from my husband. So things changed and I made her aware that I could no longer to help her and I have to have her money by the day of the bill being due. These last 3 months I’ve had to ask for the money for up to 3 days after the time like before. (Her and her boyfriend are DINKs “double income no kids” and are constantly bragging about the things they are buying) When I say anything about it she gets defensive saying they’re struggling too.  It’s hard to feel sympathy when two days before she’s telling me about everything she ordered that day. 

This month we ran into the situation where I had no ability to pay her part and started reminding her a week ahead of which day the bill was do and letting her know I need it when it’s due. Phones were shut off leaving us with owing 80 dollars for her part of plan and 80 for recconect fees per line (3 of the 4 are mine). I informed her that since I cannot risk not having my phone for emergency purposes that I think it would be good for us to part ways in the phone bill area. 

I have it now all set and ready all she has to do is accept the separation on my end. She’s refusing without saying anything. So what im wondering is AITA for trying to make her responsible for her bill on her own? An AITA if I were to continue to inquire when she will be accepting the transfer?

Edit: Extra information. I am with Verizon she is a line under me on my own plan. She pays the part for her phone which is 80 a month. When it came time to pay the bill I paid my part she did not. This disconnects everyone on my plan. Adding 80 to my bill in reconnect fees after she paid what she owed. She has provided the 100 for the bill and reconnect fee for her line. I’m still left having to paying an extra 60 just to have my 3 person lines reconnected. I have been with this plan for 3 years I will be changing over once my device is past its 3 year commitment deal. 


Plan is to send a message stating that she has til 6/2 to accept the transfer and if not on 6/14 her service will be disconnected completely and I will need the phone back.

Plan is to send a message stating that she has til 6/2 to accept the transfer and if not on 6/14 her service will be disconnected completely and I will need the phone back. 

Thank you for all your great advice and reassurance!",0.0,-0.011980929,0,1
22,1cvbzpv,AITA for not accommodating my new neighbor's reactive dog?,"Posting on mobile so apologies for the formatting. I live in the deep south, in the deep country. Things are a little different here than they are in the city. I own about 80 acres of pastures and timber, but my house is near the road. Most of my neighbors are on smaller plots of 2-10 acres. I have my front yard fenced in for my dogs, a shetland sheepdog and a mini aussie, and then my livestock in the back. The road is narrow but straight and most of the occasional traffic is loud, fast logging trucks. The fence for my yard is set about 25' back from the road, there is a drainage ditch and the a good 15' of mowed, shady, grassy strip. Apologies for the length of setup here, but it helps to explain why this person was where she was.

This morning I went to let my dogs out and found a lady walking a huge grey pitbull-looking dog right up against my fence. Of course my dogs started barking, as they should when a strange dog is on the property. The other dog reacted very poorly. Of course I called my dogs back into the house, and then went back out to see what was going on. My yard is full of dog toys and this wouldn't be the first time someone has come to ask if a stray dog lived here. 

When I went back outside the lady was standing and pointing to her dog. In an authoritative tone she said, ""He is reactive."" I said I could see that. She looked at me like I was simple. ""So you have to make accomodations for him."" This was where she lost me. Come to find out she just moved into a little rental house down the road on the corner of someone's property, her dog is recovering from knee surgery and needs to be walked a certain distance every day. She expects me to go down my driveway, out the gate, and onto the road to look up and down and make sure she isn't coming every time I let my dogs out during the day. As she was talking, her dog was snuffling around at the base of my fence and found a bully stick that my dog had dropped right on the other side of the wire and slurped it through the fence and swallowed it while. ""Oh my god! That better not be beef! He's allergic to beef! You can't just leave stuff like that laying around!""

That was when I had enough. I said, ""Ma'am, do you see that ditch right there? Everything on this side of it is my property. You are not welcome on my property. Please leave immediately. You are trespassing."" She said she couldn't walk in the road because of the trucks and I told her that wasn't my problem. She headed back the way she came and I waited for her to leave and then let my dogs out. 

I feel like I could have been more accommodating if she hadn't been so abrasive. Maybe we could have worked out a time every day where I would keep my dogs in so she could walk by for an hour or so. But I don't like being told what I can do on my own property and I feel like giving her any concession would just pave the way for more demands.

23,1cvbmi5,AITA for not pretending to be excited about my friend’s pregnancy? ,"My best friend (28f) is pregnant with her second child by a man she just started messing around with in maybe December or January. She just randomly dropped, in the middle of another conversation in a group chat with another close friend and me, that “her first child is getting a sibling.” Our other friend was ecstatic and excited immediately, while my responses were more cautious. I started off by asking “Are we happy?”, and when she said ‘yes’ I said “Congratulations🥳” and then started asking questions about if she told him and if they told their families. Basically she said she conceived this child in February and the baby would be born in November. 

For context, her first baby daddy was a piece of shit to her. He’s in the first child’s life, but he put her through hell throughout the first pregnancy by cheating on her all throughout the pregnancy (even catching a flight in the last month to go see the other woman) and just basically make her do all the work of taking care of a newborn. I didn’t live in the same state as her at the time. During this whole experience she kept what she told me and what she was going through to a minimum because I don’t forgive. Put anyone I love through hell and you will be on my shitlist for life. 

One day I decided to have a heart to heart with her about my past experiences with men and how I am traumatized, and she returned the favor by telling me everything he put her through… and let’s just say FUCK. That. Man. (Even though she ended up going back one last time after that). The conversation basically ended with me saying that I actually never liked him from the beginning but kept my opinion to myself because I knew she really liked him and her saying she wished I said something from the beginning because she really values my opinion.

Fast forward to present day. I know nothing about her new baby daddy, not even his last name. Shit, I just realized I don’t even know his real first name. Just his nickname. I sent messages on different days in the same chat that she ignored. Our other friend sent messages in the chat that she answered. I asked her another time how she’s feeling and how her first child is doing, both in the chat and independently. Every time I was ignored BUT she answered every message our other friend sent. She even created a separate group chat for another friend group group chat that included everyone from said group chat except me (I know this because my sister is in that same group chat and she wanted to know why my bff would do that).

25,1cvbi7s,AITA for wasting my moms money on a flute I didn't want?," I (16M) used to play the trumpet in band but I switched to the mellophone. My mom got me a personal trumpet and a mellophone after I switched so I can keep playing the trumpet while at home. I also wanted a trombone but my mom refused to get me one for Christmas and my birthday (around the same time) because she felt like I had too many instruments.

The thing is I know how to play the trombone I learned the slide positions and everything but she didn't care and she didn't let me get one with my own money either. But on Christmas she surprised me with a flute. I didn't ask for that but I appreciated it. It was hard as hell and took me a while to even learn how to get my embrochure right. Too many buttons and I can't really function when I play it.

I only learned two songs on it and that's all Imma learn. I absolutely hate the flute. Way harder than a recorder. It's been about three weeks since I completely stopped playing the flute and my mom is mad at me because of it. She asked me why I stopped playing and I was honest with her. I told her that I didn't like it and it was too hard to play. She got mad at me and told me that that's what practicing was for and I told her that I have been practicing.

 I practiced long enough to know I dislike it. She accused me of giving up and I told her that I wasn't giving up I just didn't wanna play anymore and I'd rather play something I know how to play. She's now upset with me and accused me of always quiting something whenever it's too difficult for me. I got offended and told her that that wasnt true. I told her that I took the initiative to learn two songs on it and that should be good enough for her.

 She told me that I wasted her money and that she won't be buying me any more instruments from now on? I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE FLUTE. I ASKED FOR A TROMBONE. Anyway I'm confused. I saw a good cheap trombone on Amazon and I could easily afford and she's hindering me from getting it. My dad told me just to keep practicing on the flute but I don't see why.

I want to make it clear we talked about what our future would look like and made it clear we would want to be engaged within 3 months of living together (to make sure we live together good but still have a long engagement until I an done with school). The first 2 months of living with him and his sister went well. until her and her boyfriend broke up. after that happened everything went down hill. keep in mind she does not pay the rent to him and i have been paying more rent then she has in the year she has lived with him. another thing to keep in mind is that we have 3 cats and a dog. she has been asking her brother to have a cat. he said no since he was using it as motivation for her to get her own place. but against his wishes she first decided to bring home a stray who happened to have a home so she gave the cat back. the second time she decided to get another stray who just had children so she had to give it back. the third time she bought a kitten (from a friend) and decided to hide it from him. he found out by the meowing coming through the door. to me that is a boundary she voluntarily crossed. thats one thing. for this next part keep in mind were on totally different sides of political spectrums and she wanted to have a topic of political beliefs even after i told her we shouldnt talk about it. we got on the topic of abortion and i told her i dont have the heart for it myself but if my daughter ever ended up pregnant i would help her to receive the care she needs. and after that she totally flipped out and told her brother he should end it since we dont “agree” on political things (my boyfriend understands its a womans choice what to do with her body) and then a week later tells him he should end it with me since we have different hobbies. ever since he has cold feet about an engagement. she has then trash talked me to their parents saying i dont take care of our animals (i do). and then told their dad that i am controlling and manipulative (i allow my boyfriend to do anything he wants) so now my image to his parents are tainted. anyways after everything I told him i dont feel comfortable living with his sister since she 1) has no boundaries 2) is openly telling my boyfriend to break up with me and 3) trash talking me to his parents. he told me i am over reacting about the whole situation, and basically needs to get over it since she has no where to go (neither of her parents want her to live with them). i understand its his sister, but after everything I feel like too many damage has been done. so AITA for asking my boyfriend to ask his sister to move out.

28,1cvbepa,AITA for wanting neighbors to remove feces ,"For the last few years my backyard has been getting remodeled. For a while it has been a bunch of dirt and whatnot. Recently had time to pay more attention to it and finished the remodel. The same neighbors have four big dogs and they use their backyard as a dumping ground for fecal matter.  I haven’t used the backyard recently due to remodeling so haven’t been back there as much. I have left some of the windows and whatnot open but never have smelled it to the point of it being an issue. Since it is newly refurbished, I’m trying to use my backyard more but the stench is unbearable. I texted them again and explained the situation. I’m not looking to start something up again but I have remodeled and will be using the backyard more. I’m not throwing any loud ragers, just small garden parties. I even told them that you don’t have to keep it squeaky clean but if I am throwing a party a certain day can I text you ahead of time so you have time to remove it before the party? We agreed.  I don’t like having to tell them to clean up their own dog poop but I understand compromises must be made. However the last year or so they have become worse and worse with maintaining their end of the deal. Sometimes they don’t text back till the day after the party, they don’t remove it, or have passive aggressive remarks. I don’t throw many parties and they aren’t even always outside. I’d say once a month maybe, so that is only twelve times a year they have to remove it. It has gotten to the point where they haven’t cleaned it up. I’ll set up for outside but the smell is so unbearable my guests end up going back inside. I spent a lot of money and put a lot of hard work into this remodel and would like to use my own backyard. It is my daughter’s birthday this week. I texted them same thing as usual.A day before the party I got a really passive aggressive reply saying, “I can’t drop everything I’m doing every second you want throw a party, I won’t bend to your whim anymore, no wonder your old neighbors left they probably hated you, please stop these threats and harassing me and my husband” I was shocked. We have always been cordial enough and I’m very understanding if something is going on in their personal life, if there was an emergency or they are out of town, etc. I responded back asking them if they were gonna remove it. No response and night before the party now, they still haven’t removed it. I have been patient and understanding for years, this week I’m filing an official complaint with police and their landlord. It is apparently illegal in our city to leave any pet feces on public or private property, it’s a serious health and house code violation. Is there anything I should know or do before filing a complaint. I will not be warning them or giving them any heads up. I have given them plenty of time and leeway but they take advantage of it.

We have always been cordial enough and I’m very understanding if something is going on in their personal life, if there was an emergency or they are out of town, etc. I responded back asking them if they were gonna remove it. No response and night before the party now, they still haven’t removed it. I have been patient and understanding for years, this week I’m filing an official complaint with police and their landlord. It is apparently illegal in our city to leave any pet feces on public or private property, it’s a serious health and house code violation. Is there anything I should know or do before filing a complaint. I will not be warning them or giving them any heads up. I have given them plenty of time and leeway but they take advantage of it. I won’t be doing anything petty like egging or TPing so don’t try to suggest that. Thanks to anyone who reads all of this.",0.0,0.012373686,0,1
29,1cvb990,"WIBTA if I bring the ""wrong date"" to a wedding?","I (41F) have an invitation to a friend Wendy's wedding, which includes a Plus 1. This friend is my bestie Amber's younger sister.

I immediately decided to bring my FWB (40M) as my date - he's a great dancer, good with a crowd, and we always have an amazing time together.

I told this to Wendy when we were chatting earlier today. She kinda of made a small face but I brushed it off as something else.

Tonight, I got a call from Amber who asked me why I wasn't bringing my sister as my Plus 1. My sister & I live together, and we are extremely close, we often do things together, so bringing her as my Plus 1 wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility. 

I said that I wanted to bring FWB so I could have a dance partner, not to mention it'll be super fun to get him all dolled up so I can undress him later. He looks good in a suit!

Amber said that Wendy expected me to bring my sister to the wedding, so could I just skip bringing FWB and bring her.

I said no. If Wendy intended my sister to come, she should have either sent a separate invite to her or address 1 single to the two of us specifically rather than to myself and guest.

Apparently Wendy is upset with me and is holding out hope that I won't bring ""some random fuck buddy"" to her wedding.

30,1cvb6bt,AITAH for accidentally getting my neighbor evicted,"So my partner and I have been in our current apt for about 4 years. We had a new upstair neighbor move in about 1year ago. Right away I began noticing tons of cigarette butts and ash on my balcony. For the first few weeks or so I would sweep them up myself (I dont like confrontation) but eventually it started getting worse, cigarette butts, lit cigarettes(one of which burned a hole in our chair cushion, a major fire hazard), teeth flossers, food items and other trash. Once when they were out on their deck my fiance shouted up to them, ""can you please stop dumping your stuff down here?"" They later talked to us and said they accidentally dropped them but we really didnt buy that because there were so many and the variety of stuff that was there. Fast forward to a couple months ago, we began seeing large bags full of trash being thrown down into the woods below often times trash would fall out of the bags and land on our porch. We were also getting tons of dry ceral on our porch(our balconies face thick woods with a creek about 100ft below) anyways we saw this happening pretty often, atleast once a week. We asked them again to please stop throwing trash. They denied it claiming they never threw trash, they're the top floor so unless someone is living on the roof, its them. I would also like to include that our downstairs neighbor also gets tons of garbage, cigarettes and cereal on their balcony. They are just as frustrated as we are. Anyways the upstairs completely denied throwing trash ever. The evidence is visible by looking down off our balcony. Bags, trash all kind of stuff. Plus our downstairs neighbor and us have seen it being thrown with our own eyes. The downstairs neighbor got really mad and went up and full on yelled at them. I dont condone this but I was really hoping they would finally stop. They had this big dramatic reaction, ""OH im SO sorry! I had NO idea, it'll NEVER happen again!"" Cue the next day we see trash being thrown off again, with some landing on our balcony. I finally sent a complaint to our apt manager because it was very frustrating and I was tired of interacting with them. That leads us to today. My partner and I get back from a date and they're outside packing things. They say to us, ""just so you know Ive been given a 30 day notice to vacate, I told you I didnt throw anything.""

Im really shocked. I didnt want them to get kicked out. More a fine or stern talking to just so they would finally stop. Before them we had a literal meth lab up there that management wouldn't do anything about.  So im really dumbfounded that they would kick someone out over this. I never meant for this to happen and I feel really bad.

31,1cvb2on,AITA for suggesting my friend show me his junk?,"I (23m) am a medical student. Ive been taking medical classes from high school till now since I was 14. I’ve worked in hospitals, pharmacies, doctors offices, and clinics. I am very versed on medicine, and I’ve spent time around infections and other diseases. My friend (22m) is not versed on medicine or sexual safety whatsoever. He likes to get around. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but he neglects safety often times. Well one day he called me over the phone and asked me to come over, because he believes he contracted a nasty infection on his junk. I came over and he went on an emotional rant about how he messed up, and he doesn’t know what to do. He said he didn’t want to consult a doctor because, he can’t afford it right now. He started screaming in Spanish (I’m Dominican and he’s Mexican). I asked him his symptoms, and he said there was a bit of a rash and it kind of burned to pee. I told him that if he were to let me take a look, I would be able to tell him if this is anything to worry about, and if he should consult a doctor. He started getting upset and uncomfortable. He said that that’s gay, and he would never do it, and he doesn’t believe I would ever ask that. He asked why I would ever suggest that, and now he’s going to look at me different. Well I’m not sure exactly why he called a MEDICAL STUDENT over his house to complain about a potential illness if he wouldn’t let me assess it. He said I made the situation much worse, and he told me that I could go home because I’m not helping. We’ve been best friends for 7 years, so I’m not sure exactly what he’s so embarrassed of and why he’s acting like this. He hasn’t talked to me since the situation and he’s ignoring me. It’s been over a week.

AITA?

EDIT: I work around patients with these kinds of things all the time. I’ve been doing clinical rotations screening consultations in hospitals, doctors offices, pharmacies, and clinics since I was 14. I’m a Certified Pharmacy Technician. I’m currently a 3rd year medical student since I graduated college early, so I already have patients that I currently work with. This isn’t my first time seeing something like this. I very much will know what I’m seeing. I know not to diagnose anything since I’m not a doctor YET, but I will tell you if something is a worry.

32,1cvb26r,AITA for being overbearing with my roommate?,"I (25f) live with a roommate (25f) we’ll call her Kate. 

Kate and I lived with each other in college, and she got an internship in the same town that I work in, so we decided to move in with each other. The internship is pretty demanding, and she works 50 hour weeks with very little pay, so she is often stressed out. I try my best to give her the space that she needs, but I also try to say hi and make small talk when we’re both in the common areas of our house. She always acts annoyed to talk to me, so I’ve been distancing myself more.

The problem is that I just feel like we don’t communicate with each other. I sat her down to tell her that I feel like there are some issues that need to be addressed, but it just feels tense to talk about because we use to be friends and now she just doesn’t talk to me at all. These are the things I brought up:

1. She has a boyfriend who lives two hours away, and when he comes over it will be for an entire week or weekend, and she doesn’t understand why this would annoy me or why she needs to tell me he’s coming over. She claims that she pays half the rent so she can have over whoever she wants. I don’t mind him coming over, but I just want a heads up.

2. She always stays in her bedroom, so I will use the living room since nobody else is using it and watch TV or read a book. I just prefer to not be in my bedroom unless I’m sleeping, and during the day I’m normally in an office at work, while she works from home. She claims that I use the living room too much and she’s confined to her bedroom. She has never told me she felt this way until today, so I’m not sure how I was suppose to know she felt that way.

She seems to think that I’m being controlling and that she doesn’t feel any ownership over the house we live in, but she just never talks to me and I can’t read her mind.
