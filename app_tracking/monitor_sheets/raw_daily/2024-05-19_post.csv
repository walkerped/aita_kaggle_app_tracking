0,1cvriig,WIBTA if I didn't let my (18TF) sister live in my apartment with me?,"About a month ago, my mom asked my younger sibling to let my sister live with them in their 1 bedroom apt and work down there to get some job experience.They said they couldn't cause their friend was already living with them as well as their combined 1 dog and 2 cats. So it deferred to me. I asked why they wanted her out the house so bad and it turned out my stepfather was coming home on leave then retirement in July/Aug. 

Now, my stepfather is a piece of shit. He verbally abuses my mother, my sibling and myself and physically abused my sister due to her being ""a problem child"" in my highschool years. Things such as Military PT, standing in a corner for 5+hours, and writing over 100 pages front to back of lines. My sibling and I also got some of this but nothing as bad as my sister. My sister reasonably is terrified of this man and the few times he's come to visit, she refuses to leave her room and will wait til he's asleep or out the house to even grab food and drinks. 

He is not aware that she is trans (most of our family doesn't know) but she's grown out her hair and dresses a bit more feminine when she feels comfortable. My stepfather is a highly conservative person who on several occasions has said my mom is a terrible mother cause all her children are gay/trans/nonbinary and it was somehow her fault. 

Now to the part that might make me the asshole, I haven't said no yet but I'm worried about a few things.

1.  My sister can not drive so she can't get herself to work, (The town we live in is mostly highways and since she's autistic and highly antisocial, working at the restaurant closest to our house isn't the best option) so we would have to drive her.

2. We would have to choose between a living space and our gaming setups. We chose this space due to the amount of stuff we have and to have a comfortable space to live in. Having to get rid of my art workspace in the dining room area or his vr setup to give the other room to my sister seems unfair to us. 

I feel like we are unreasonably having to compromise our comfortability for my mom to stay with a shitty human being. We have talked with her on multiple occasions asking why, if she knows that man makes her children uncomfortable, is she willing to stay with him? Her response is always that she still loves him or he isn't that bad or ""[Sister] can just such it up"". I want to make it clear if anything happened to my sister while he was there I would immediately go get her to let her crash at my place for a bit. I never want her to be unsafe.

I don't really have any friends due to moving around alot and everyone I know is emotionally invested in this conflict. I have been told I'm being selfish and an asshole for not immediately saying yes and moving her in right away. But I'm also being told it isn't my responsibility to take care of my sister, it's my mom's responsibility. 

Please any advice will be greatly appreciated. AITA?

1,1cvqgmg,UPDATE: AITA for deliberately misunderstanding my baby's father?,"so it turns out he’s got deep-seated resentment for me lol.

he resents me for:

earning more money than him

being further in my career than he is

not losing my job during covid like he did

having parents who love and support me

not being a submissive woman (lol)

having a present and loving father

not combining our finances thus making him feel small

so when i last came here, i said i’d asked him to come home and discuss our future with baby, preferably in the presence of a neutral party. he left me on read for a few days though i could see he was spying on us through the ring door bell and baby’s monitor. i disconnected them both and he finally responded 🫠

he came home very irate and rejected my offer to have a neutral facilitator for the conversation. i asked how we're supposed to move forward and the rant above came out in a full mask off moment. any hope i had that you guys were wrong about him died that day.

he again rejected the offer to hyphenate baby’s surname. apparently i’m ‘disrespectful’ and ‘insolent’ for refusing to ‘do what’s right’ and give baby their ‘rightful’ surname. i told him i won’t go through the administrative nightmare of having a different surname to my child, and lots of data shows a double barrelled surname is social currency that has positive connotations. nope - he wouldn’t budge. i told him neither would i - baby either has both our surnames or mine alone.

he asked if this was a hill i wanted this relationship to end on, if i was prepared to throw half a decade down the drain over my ‘silly little feminism’. i told him i wasn’t sure there was anything left to fight for. we broke up. thankfully, our - in his name - lease expires end of may. i called my dad and he came to help me back up baby.

i messaged him to suggest we still need couple’s counselling: we need to learn to be co-parents and they can help us establish a healthy way of doing that. he again said no to that so

my mum wanted to take me and baby on a baby moon holiday after this stressful period but he would grant permission for me to take baby abroad :)))))))

it’s going to be a long road ahead. i’ve instructed a lawyer to help us set up a formal agreement to avoid this in the future. he’s not responding to correspondance from the lawyer so that’s fun. he’s sulking - used to do this a lot when things didn’t go his way. i hope he’ll soon realise i no longer have time for his bs and i won’t be toyed with because i called his bluff and ended the relationship

to end on a bright note, the house i wanted us to buy a couple of years ago - which he talked me out of until he was back on his feet again despite us being able to afford it on my salary alone - is back on the market! i took it as fate: it’s time to move on from this man! it’s a beautiful Victorian terrace near good schools, good transport links, a small garden and close to my parents. it’d be the perfect home for baby and i. i put in an offer in - wish me luck!",UPDATE,2024-05-19,"UPDATE: AITA for deliberately misunderstanding my baby's father? so it turns out he’s got deep-seated resentment for me lol.

2,1cvedmx,WIBTAH if I distanced myself from my best friend over these things?  ,"I (28F) am conflicted because I don’t know if my best friend (29F) is a bad friend or if this is just a ME problem. My family’s restaurant of 25 years recently got shut down and I’m afraid I may just be going through a rough time. But also, so much of what she does triggers me. Please be honest. 
——-

I met my friend Sarah in martial arts class when we were both 20 and we connected immediately. We were the type of friends that didn’t really hang out much outside of class, but whenever we did get together it awesome! She was like the first and only irl friend I made in my 20s and we both call each other “best friend” since we met. 

Recently, I’ve felt like I no longer want to see her. I first felt this about 2 years ago when her other friends and I were helping her move. Sarah got pregnant when she was 23 and I didn’t find out until she was 8 months in and planning a baby shower. She said she didn’t tell me about it because she didn’t want anyone in our martial arts group to know and wanted to keep it secret. Understood. During the move though, I witnessed her other girl friends reminiscing with her about how excited they felt when she told them about her pregnancy. They were showing off the ultrasound photos and everything. This stung a bit.

I had a falling out with another girl friend of mine  back in 2019. I was the one that introduced Sarah to her. I unfortunately learned that my past friend was talking about me and my family behind my back. Sarah still hangs out with her to this day despite that and they travel/post Instagram pics together. I’ve explained to Sarah how that friend basically ghosted me and is out here talking about me. I just recently found out that friend is the SAME person that was there when Sarah gave birth. I don’t see their friendship changing anytime soon.

My family’s restaurant is vegetarian. We were struggling to stay open this past year, and I’d see Sarah posting pics of herself eating at other vegetarian restaurants in the area. People are free to eat where they choose, but I must admit I was upset since she could’ve supported my family’s restaurant instead. My family even offered her a place in our restaurant to put up her crochet designs when she first got started with her business. Sarah has text me about going to eat at other vegetarian restaurants and in the back of my mind I’m thinking, “Are you dense… first off my family and I are struggling for money here! I can’t even afford to go out and secondly why would I want to support competition?” This pissed me off. 

Fast forward 2024. When Sarah and I hang out these days, it’s mostly because she needs my advice on a guy/needs to vent. I don’t mind this as I love giving advice to those in need, but I just want the same support system for myself, especially during this rough time. She allows me space to vent, but I just don’t feel fulfilled after our convos, more drained. When we text there are so many misunderstandings. All these little things I wrote about above are getting to me and I just want to stop connecting with her. Do you think I’m being dramatic? Would I be an a*hole if I brought up all this stuff to her first?

So me and my cousins were going out to get ice cream for us and our parents. Im the youngest in my family ( 18M) with cousins that are in the mid twenties and older. They usually pay for most of the things as I don't have a job and are like my older siblings in a way. Obviously, I didn't want to just sit there and let them pay for mine so I offered to pay for mine and my parents ice cream ( in other words, dutch ).  I got scolded at by not offering to pay for everyones pretty harshly, even being called selfish,  and I feel very bad about it. I didn't do it because I just wanted to be nice, I did it because it was the right thing to do, or so I thought. Like I said, I know theres not much to go off of, but I really just wanted to know if Im the asshole for not paying for everyone. Sorry if it's a dumb post, I just need to know so I can make better decisions in the future.

5,1cve518,AITA because I don't want to split the electricity bill 50/50 with my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend and I have been living together for 2 years. We rent a two bedroom apartment. We both travel a lot for work and there are some weeks where its just me and some weeks where its just him. When it comes to money, I am definitely more cautious. I budget my money and am careful with my purchases because I am trying to build up my savings to buy a house. My boyfriend is more relaxed with his money and doesn't think about budget or how much credit card debt he is in. 

 In the beginning of us living together, we were splitting the bills equally. But as months went by, I noticed a big fluctuation between months where I was home more and when he was home more. The bill was about $100-$150 higher when he was at home more. He typically will leave things on like the tv, lights, computer, etc. All day and night. When we are both home, I'm usually turning things off when he's not using them. So without me to turn them off, the bill racked up.

 He also leaves the windows open while the AC or Heat is on. He says its because he likes the fresh air but doesnt want the apartment to get too hot/cold. I've told him many times that it racks up the electricity bill and could potentially break the system, leaving us with no AC or heat and probably having to pay to fix it. He then offered to pay the whole bill himself to end me nagging him about it. 

Thats been our arrangement for the last year. Last December, I got a new job and am now working from home. He still leaves everything on and runs the AC with the windows open. A couple of weeks ago, he said he wanted to talk about the bills. He said that its not fair he still has to pay the whole electricty bill when I am home all the time. 

I explained that we had data that proved that even when its just me, I still use half as much as him. I told him I would be happy to pay 70/30 but wouldn't do 50/50 because its not fair to me that he wants to be wasteful. He said I was being petty and that couples should split things 50/50.

6,1cve3ry,AITA for Trying to Change my Fathers Hoarding Problem?,"
This has been absolutely draining my energy for years but i believe its for a higher purpose. 


Background: Im in my 20s living with father and every single year, I clean the garage, the shed, the basement, with the goal of becoming 1% more functional then yesterday. I do this when im not working hard in school, on my time off. I also buy and resell on the side. 

Problem: However, its not my house. Its my fathers. But he collects junk, literally stuff thats not valuable, with no absolute meaning. Its a 3 story house and he is not poor, hes like middle class, works 50 hours a week. But thats his excuse for everything.

Background: Im in my 20s living with father and every single year, I clean the garage, the shed, the basement, with the goal of becoming 1% more functional then yesterday. I do this when im not working hard in school, on my time off. I also buy and resell on the side. 

Problem: However, its not my house. Its my fathers. But he collects junk, literally stuff thats not valuable, with no absolute meaning. Its a 3 story house and he is not poor, hes like middle class, works 50 hours a week. But thats his excuse for everything.

7,1cve36y,WIBTA for contacting my ex’s job about a personal conflict?,"WIBTA for contacting my ex’s job about a personal conflict? First, for a long backstory. My ex, lets call him L (19m) and I (18f) were talking again recently in an attempt to reconnect, which was my first mistake. I asked if he still had feelings for me and in return, I was told to “fuck off” and other things I can’t say here.

About a month later, he said he did some thinking and would like to meet for lunch to discuss things. I agreed, although i knew it would probably end poorly. We met and talked about how things have been going for each of us, and I did tell him that what he said made me lose whatever I felt for him almost instantly. He seemed to kind of accept that and move on.

Over the past three months, we were talking like friends, and occasionally he would say things that would hint at us being more than friends again (I know, big mistake on my part). It was an inevitable conversation that needed to be had. Eventually, just a couple weeks ago now, I asked to meet for lunch again and told him that I didn’t think we should be in a romantic relationship. “Between me starting college in the fall, his lack of commitment to travel, and just an overall lack of similarity in what we wanted for our lives,” is what I told him. I also mentioned that made me uncomfortable that he was telling strangers online about me, which is similar to something he did when we first dated.

Later, he sent me a long line of voice messages of him screaming about how I led him on and that he knew I would do this to him, which is fair on his part to a point, but I had specifically told him that I didn’t feel romantic interest in him anymore from when we first met up for lunch because of what he said to me.

Additionally, if it gives any context to his character, he ranted to my friend to other day about how so many women could show up at any point and genuinely ruin his life. So, that’s another clue and massive red flag as to what I’m dealing with.

Now, my ex and I used to work in the kitchen of a healthcare facility down the road from the high school we both attended. I quit in June of 2023 because I was moving, but he continues to work there and has told me multiple times that he’s considered staying there for a while. Recently, I found out he is telling residents during mealtime, while on the clock, obscenely warped versions of what happened while painting me in an awful light. He is using this to fuel his argument that “I am wrong and he is right”.

Since I still know the manager, I was thinking of emailing or going in person to ask them to ask him to stop. Something non-specific along the lines of, “Please keep out-of-work matters outside of work and away from the residents while on the clock”.

I (M15) have been friends with Amelia (F14) for 3 year. We met during online school in 2021 and exchanged discords. At this time, I was told her father had just passed due to the virus and, being one of the few people Amelia talked to at the time, I was sort of her crutch.

Because we go to schools so close to each other, we have some mutual friends that go to either of our schools. Most of these friends we met after online school, in 7th grade. I was talking with a few of our friends and Amelia came up in the conversation. One of our friends mentioned making plans with her and Amelia telling them that their dad doesn't let her hang out with people on week days. I got confused and asked if they meant her mom or her granddad but they doubled down and assured me that Amelia had said her *father* said no. I informed them that Amelias father had passed over covid and another friend chimed in, saying they had met her father, alive and well.

I went home that night and scrolled through me and Amelias texts, making sure that I wasn't making the whole thing up in my head.

I tell her that i'm not trying to drive too far away from the school because I would have to pick up my younger brother later. she leaves. I'm hungry. i ask my guy friend to go grab something to eat 10 minutes away. she has my location. she knows i hung out with him. shes mad.

I told him that I’m sorry she did that to him but they both have been my friend for about the same amount of time and I am trying to understand both sides. AITA?

I try to ignore it but sometimes it feels like I’m the host who plans everything without any help.

I have diagnosed autism and it has impacted my relationships/ friendships all my life since I find gatherings extremely overwhelming.

So technically there was a fair in town and we were all planning to go but they suddenly had no money and were expecting me to pay so I wanted to try something and told them I also had no money since I noticed I paid for everything.

I wasn’t upset or anything but I was annoyed that they decided to send a picture to me like it was rubbing it in my face.

I did try and talk to R about it and she got upset at me and angry at me because I was annoyed and she started accusing me of stuff. That’s what made me angry and I told her I don’t want to be friends with them anymore. Was I overreacting?

16,1cvcvlr,"AITA for Yelling at My Parents to ""Get It Together"" About Their Dirty House?","I (M22) recently graduated from college.  I’ve spent the last few weeks living back with my parents while I figure out career stuff.  They’ve been kind enough to let me live here rent free for at least the next few months.  It’s been an admittedly difficult transition.  I’ve caught myself being moody, snapping at them like a teenager.  

The problem comes from the house itself.  It’s completely falling apart. 

It’s a big two-story that they would never have been able to afford if it hadn’t been sold “as is”. And “is” is filled with rot and pests, and it seems like nothing is being done about it.  I knew it was a little dirty when I grew up, but I don’t think I realized how bad it was until I moved back.  There’s a lot wrong, but I’ll condense.  

We have mice.  They refuse to get an exterminator because they’re worried about our two small dogs getting sick.  We’ve resorted to dozens of small traps, but the mice have learned to avoid them.  They’ve gotten into every room at this point.  I’ve found mouse droppings IN THE STOVE.  

The house, and especially the bathrooms, are filled with mold.  Every time I visited for Christmas or summer, I’d bring it up, clean it while I was there, and when I came back it would be right back to where it was.  The shower grout is absolutely coated in black.  I had to beg my mother to buy a new shower curtain liner - the old one was knee high stained in mold spots.  

My final straw was when I was cleaning out my bedroom closet.  A box full of some of my stuff had been chewed through and destroyed by the mice.  It had some things that were sentimental AND a few things that were monetarily valuable that I’d bought with my own money.  They’d made a nest out of it.  The box and surrounding floor were covered in mouse droppings.  

I stopped myself from storming to my parents but as soon as I saw them later that day, I started yelling and crying.  I don’t remember the exact specifics, but I’d sum it up as such:

“The mold and mouse situation is absolutely fucking absurd.”

Dad: “You are always so judgemental, you always have something to say when you visit”

 “Maybe I’d have less to say if you took care of it.”

Dad: “You’re one to talk.  You’re not exactly Mr. Clean”

“I’m 22.  I’m not the one who bought a house I couldn’t take care of. My shit was destroyed”

Dad: “It’s really not that big of a deal. We’re taking care of it”

“You should fucking pull it together for once.  If you think this is ""taking care of it"".  Fucking insane!”

There was some more yelling.  I slammed a door like a child.  I haven’t really talked to them in the past few days.  I was talking to my brother earlier and he mentioned I was “kind of a dick”, and I’m conflicted.  It’s not my house but it’s just been concerning me.  I’m worried about my and my parents' health.

So, Am I The Asshole?

I told her that I understand that she is upset but that I was as well for the way she handled the wedding. I wasn't acknowledged as her dad during the wedding at all.

Her Mother and mother's Husband was acknowledged as parents of the bride, and gave the welcome speech before dinner. I initially got up to give the speech, but sat back down when I realized her mother's husband was doing it. That was honestly the moment that hurt me the most and I decided to leave before dinner. 

I gave my daughter a hug before leaving and told her that I wasn't feeling well and was going home to lay down. She seemed okay with me leaving. I called her the next morning to let her know that I was deeply hurt by her and that she should have reached out so I could have been more involved. I wanted her to understand how her being my only child, that those moments that ive now missed should have been special.

18,1cvcfmo,AITA for not allowing my gfs 65 y/o dad stay in our 1 bdr appt for 2-3 weeks when he comes to visit?,"
My (36M) FIL comes to stay with my partner (35F) and I every year for about 2-3 weeks, and this year I have asked for the trip to be shorter, after this years visit I’m at the point where I am over the whole thing.

Our families live half way across the country but my folks understand that it would be too tight to stay in our space so they stay somewhere else when they come. We go back to where we are from a few times a year so it’s not that we don’t see our families.

It’s a small apartment and I feel like it does not seat 3 people comfortably. Especially when the living room has an air mattress taking up 2/3 of the space.

I love the guy but I’ve always known he’s a little out of touch with social interactions and loves to make himself personally comfortable in any space he’s in. We live in a beautiful city but he seems to have little interest in checking things out and will relay on us to tour him around. Sure we get a few free sit down meals that I am thankful for so I guess this is life with the in-laws.

I feel like it can be manageable as I work longer hours and am not home the majority of the time but it feels like more social work when I get home. My partner is a people pleaser and I feel she has a tough time asking for the trips to be shorter.

I don’t feel like it is my place to put the boundaries around this but I feel like she doesn’t have courage to confront this situation.

19,1cvcac5,WIBTA if i told my mom she doesnt deserve a car because she scammed it from me? ,"I (23M) decided to take a bank loan to buy a car. It was a big step for me, and I was both nervous and excited about the decision. I asked my mom for help because she's more knowledgeable about these matters. However, she's quite particular—if she's not reminded to do something, she won't do it, and if you remind her too often, she feels pressured.

She advised me not to buy the first car I saw or to make a purchase out of desperation. She also warned against buying a car that was just 'okay.' I was adamant about using only my money because I wanted the car to be solely mine and to avoid any potential arguments with her over financial contributions.

Despite this, my mom took out a loan to help me get a 'nicer' car, even though I had used part of my loan for other expenses. I reluctantly agreed to her help under the condition that it wouldn't lead to any arguments. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened after we got the car.

She also insisted on looking for trucks, claiming I would look 'dumb' getting out of a small car due to my height—I'm 6 feet tall. I didn't agree with her reasoning and continued to send her recommendations for small cars.

To my surprise, she bought a car without my input—the only one she had contacted—and based on her friend's opinion that 'the motor looked nice.' This broke both rules she had set. When she picked me up from work with the car, I immediately noticed several issues: a cracked front window, only two functioning windows, a missing door handle, weak lights, and faulty wipers. Later, we discovered the car leaked and had overheating problems.

The repairs were costly, and my mom had to take out a second loan. This led to a fight because it was the exact situation I wanted to avoid. The car has continued to deteriorate and become more expensive to maintain. Now, my mom complains about the car's condition and claims it's practically hers because she's investing in the repairs, even though the car is registered in my name.

Everytime my mom mentions any issues with the car i tell her to please cut it short bc i'm not comfortable with hesring anything else the car needs to get fixed (the fact i'm going through a heavy depressive episode is not helping either), but i feel one day if she keeps up with this i'll blow up and tell her that is all her fault and that she cost me a nice car i could take care of myself, and that it seems like all she did was scam me out of my money, convince me to take a loan, all for her to mess up big time for something is now not even mine bc all she'll do is gaslight me into just surrendering the car to her.

I understand she's the one that at the end have been investing the most into the car so she'd be right to say that, but i'm not kidding... I feel scammed out of it and i'm tired to not even feel ownership of something i so desperately wanted.

21,1cvbzyq,AITA for trying to separating my phone plan from my best friend?,"
TL/DR: Best friend of 3 years keeps making the mistake of paying her bill late. This time making my phones get shut off and me owing 160 just to turn them back on. I cannot help her and cannot risk it again, so I am requesting her to make her own account but she is refusing to accept. AITA? An AITA for continuing to inquire when she will accept the transfer?



Little back story. Bestfriend of 3 years. I added her to my phone plan to save money for both of us. I over these last 2 years have helped her out 9/10 every month by covering her phone bill so she had a couple of day extra to get the money to me. Never didn’t pay me except 1 time and gave her the benefit of the doubt when she said it wouldn’t happen again. 

Last September my life flipped upside down. Lost my house, found out I was pregnant, and was screwed over by the person who tried to give me a place to live after the fact. Due to to my pregnancy I can no longer work being high risk making our income a one person income from my husband. So things changed and I made her aware that I could no longer to help her and I have to have her money by the day of the bill being due. These last 3 months I’ve had to ask for the money for up to 3 days after the time like before. (Her and her boyfriend are DINKs “double income no kids” and are constantly bragging about the things they are buying) When I say anything about it she gets defensive saying they’re struggling too.  It’s hard to feel sympathy when two days before she’s telling me about everything she ordered that day. 

This month we ran into the situation where I had no ability to pay her part and started reminding her a week ahead of which day the bill was do and letting her know I need it when it’s due. Phones were shut off leaving us with owing 80 dollars for her part of plan and 80 for recconect fees per line (3 of the 4 are mine). I informed her that since I cannot risk not having my phone for emergency purposes that I think it would be good for us to part ways in the phone bill area. 

I have it now all set and ready all she has to do is accept the separation on my end. She’s refusing without saying anything. So what im wondering is AITA for trying to make her responsible for her bill on her own? An AITA if I were to continue to inquire when she will be accepting the transfer?

Edit: Extra information. I am with Verizon she is a line under me on my own plan. She pays the part for her phone which is 80 a month. When it came time to pay the bill I paid my part she did not. This disconnects everyone on my plan. Adding 80 to my bill in reconnect fees after she paid what she owed. She has provided the 100 for the bill and reconnect fee for her line. I’m still left having to paying an extra 60 just to have my 3 person lines reconnected. I have been with this plan for 3 years I will be changing over once my device is past its 3 year commitment deal. 


Plan is to send a message stating that she has til 6/2 to accept the transfer and if not on 6/14 her service will be disconnected completely and I will need the phone back.

Plan is to send a message stating that she has til 6/2 to accept the transfer and if not on 6/14 her service will be disconnected completely and I will need the phone back. 

Thank you for all your great advice and reassurance!",0.0,-0.011980929,0,1
22,1cvbzpv,AITA for not accommodating my new neighbor's reactive dog?,"Posting on mobile so apologies for the formatting. I live in the deep south, in the deep country. Things are a little different here than they are in the city. I own about 80 acres of pastures and timber, but my house is near the road. Most of my neighbors are on smaller plots of 2-10 acres. I have my front yard fenced in for my dogs, a shetland sheepdog and a mini aussie, and then my livestock in the back. The road is narrow but straight and most of the occasional traffic is loud, fast logging trucks. The fence for my yard is set about 25' back from the road, there is a drainage ditch and the a good 15' of mowed, shady, grassy strip. Apologies for the length of setup here, but it helps to explain why this person was where she was.

This morning I went to let my dogs out and found a lady walking a huge grey pitbull-looking dog right up against my fence. Of course my dogs started barking, as they should when a strange dog is on the property. The other dog reacted very poorly. Of course I called my dogs back into the house, and then went back out to see what was going on. My yard is full of dog toys and this wouldn't be the first time someone has come to ask if a stray dog lived here. 

When I went back outside the lady was standing and pointing to her dog. In an authoritative tone she said, ""He is reactive."" I said I could see that. She looked at me like I was simple. ""So you have to make accomodations for him."" This was where she lost me. Come to find out she just moved into a little rental house down the road on the corner of someone's property, her dog is recovering from knee surgery and needs to be walked a certain distance every day. She expects me to go down my driveway, out the gate, and onto the road to look up and down and make sure she isn't coming every time I let my dogs out during the day. As she was talking, her dog was snuffling around at the base of my fence and found a bully stick that my dog had dropped right on the other side of the wire and slurped it through the fence and swallowed it while. ""Oh my god! That better not be beef! He's allergic to beef! You can't just leave stuff like that laying around!""

That was when I had enough. I said, ""Ma'am, do you see that ditch right there? Everything on this side of it is my property. You are not welcome on my property. Please leave immediately. You are trespassing."" She said she couldn't walk in the road because of the trucks and I told her that wasn't my problem. She headed back the way she came and I waited for her to leave and then let my dogs out. 

I feel like I could have been more accommodating if she hadn't been so abrasive. Maybe we could have worked out a time every day where I would keep my dogs in so she could walk by for an hour or so. But I don't like being told what I can do on my own property and I feel like giving her any concession would just pave the way for more demands.

23,1cvbmi5,AITA for not pretending to be excited about my friend’s pregnancy? ,"My best friend (28f) is pregnant with her second child by a man she just started messing around with in maybe December or January. She just randomly dropped, in the middle of another conversation in a group chat with another close friend and me, that “her first child is getting a sibling.” Our other friend was ecstatic and excited immediately, while my responses were more cautious. I started off by asking “Are we happy?”, and when she said ‘yes’ I said “Congratulations🥳” and then started asking questions about if she told him and if they told their families. Basically she said she conceived this child in February and the baby would be born in November. 

For context, her first baby daddy was a piece of shit to her. He’s in the first child’s life, but he put her through hell throughout the first pregnancy by cheating on her all throughout the pregnancy (even catching a flight in the last month to go see the other woman) and just basically make her do all the work of taking care of a newborn. I didn’t live in the same state as her at the time. During this whole experience she kept what she told me and what she was going through to a minimum because I don’t forgive. Put anyone I love through hell and you will be on my shitlist for life. 

One day I decided to have a heart to heart with her about my past experiences with men and how I am traumatized, and she returned the favor by telling me everything he put her through… and let’s just say FUCK. That. Man. (Even though she ended up going back one last time after that). The conversation basically ended with me saying that I actually never liked him from the beginning but kept my opinion to myself because I knew she really liked him and her saying she wished I said something from the beginning because she really values my opinion.

Fast forward to present day. I know nothing about her new baby daddy, not even his last name. Shit, I just realized I don’t even know his real first name. Just his nickname. I sent messages on different days in the same chat that she ignored. Our other friend sent messages in the chat that she answered. I asked her another time how she’s feeling and how her first child is doing, both in the chat and independently. Every time I was ignored BUT she answered every message our other friend sent. She even created a separate group chat for another friend group group chat that included everyone from said group chat except me (I know this because my sister is in that same group chat and she wanted to know why my bff would do that).

25,1cvbi7s,AITA for wasting my moms money on a flute I didn't want?," I (16M) used to play the trumpet in band but I switched to the mellophone. My mom got me a personal trumpet and a mellophone after I switched so I can keep playing the trumpet while at home. I also wanted a trombone but my mom refused to get me one for Christmas and my birthday (around the same time) because she felt like I had too many instruments.

The thing is I know how to play the trombone I learned the slide positions and everything but she didn't care and she didn't let me get one with my own money either. But on Christmas she surprised me with a flute. I didn't ask for that but I appreciated it. It was hard as hell and took me a while to even learn how to get my embrochure right. Too many buttons and I can't really function when I play it.

I only learned two songs on it and that's all Imma learn. I absolutely hate the flute. Way harder than a recorder. It's been about three weeks since I completely stopped playing the flute and my mom is mad at me because of it. She asked me why I stopped playing and I was honest with her. I told her that I didn't like it and it was too hard to play. She got mad at me and told me that that's what practicing was for and I told her that I have been practicing.

 I practiced long enough to know I dislike it. She accused me of giving up and I told her that I wasn't giving up I just didn't wanna play anymore and I'd rather play something I know how to play. She's now upset with me and accused me of always quiting something whenever it's too difficult for me. I got offended and told her that that wasnt true. I told her that I took the initiative to learn two songs on it and that should be good enough for her.

 She told me that I wasted her money and that she won't be buying me any more instruments from now on? I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE FLUTE. I ASKED FOR A TROMBONE. Anyway I'm confused. I saw a good cheap trombone on Amazon and I could easily afford and she's hindering me from getting it. My dad told me just to keep practicing on the flute but I don't see why.

I want to make it clear we talked about what our future would look like and made it clear we would want to be engaged within 3 months of living together (to make sure we live together good but still have a long engagement until I an done with school). The first 2 months of living with him and his sister went well. until her and her boyfriend broke up. after that happened everything went down hill. keep in mind she does not pay the rent to him and i have been paying more rent then she has in the year she has lived with him. another thing to keep in mind is that we have 3 cats and a dog. she has been asking her brother to have a cat. he said no since he was using it as motivation for her to get her own place. but against his wishes she first decided to bring home a stray who happened to have a home so she gave the cat back. the second time she decided to get another stray who just had children so she had to give it back. the third time she bought a kitten (from a friend) and decided to hide it from him. he found out by the meowing coming through the door. to me that is a boundary she voluntarily crossed. thats one thing. for this next part keep in mind were on totally different sides of political spectrums and she wanted to have a topic of political beliefs even after i told her we shouldnt talk about it. we got on the topic of abortion and i told her i dont have the heart for it myself but if my daughter ever ended up pregnant i would help her to receive the care she needs. and after that she totally flipped out and told her brother he should end it since we dont “agree” on political things (my boyfriend understands its a womans choice what to do with her body) and then a week later tells him he should end it with me since we have different hobbies. ever since he has cold feet about an engagement. she has then trash talked me to their parents saying i dont take care of our animals (i do). and then told their dad that i am controlling and manipulative (i allow my boyfriend to do anything he wants) so now my image to his parents are tainted. anyways after everything I told him i dont feel comfortable living with his sister since she 1) has no boundaries 2) is openly telling my boyfriend to break up with me and 3) trash talking me to his parents. he told me i am over reacting about the whole situation, and basically needs to get over it since she has no where to go (neither of her parents want her to live with them). i understand its his sister, but after everything I feel like too many damage has been done. so AITA for asking my boyfriend to ask his sister to move out.

28,1cvbepa,AITA for wanting neighbors to remove feces ,"For the last few years my backyard has been getting remodeled. For a while it has been a bunch of dirt and whatnot. Recently had time to pay more attention to it and finished the remodel. The same neighbors have four big dogs and they use their backyard as a dumping ground for fecal matter.  I haven’t used the backyard recently due to remodeling so haven’t been back there as much. I have left some of the windows and whatnot open but never have smelled it to the point of it being an issue. Since it is newly refurbished, I’m trying to use my backyard more but the stench is unbearable. I texted them again and explained the situation. I’m not looking to start something up again but I have remodeled and will be using the backyard more. I’m not throwing any loud ragers, just small garden parties. I even told them that you don’t have to keep it squeaky clean but if I am throwing a party a certain day can I text you ahead of time so you have time to remove it before the party? We agreed.  I don’t like having to tell them to clean up their own dog poop but I understand compromises must be made. However the last year or so they have become worse and worse with maintaining their end of the deal. Sometimes they don’t text back till the day after the party, they don’t remove it, or have passive aggressive remarks. I don’t throw many parties and they aren’t even always outside. I’d say once a month maybe, so that is only twelve times a year they have to remove it. It has gotten to the point where they haven’t cleaned it up. I’ll set up for outside but the smell is so unbearable my guests end up going back inside. I spent a lot of money and put a lot of hard work into this remodel and would like to use my own backyard. It is my daughter’s birthday this week. I texted them same thing as usual.A day before the party I got a really passive aggressive reply saying, “I can’t drop everything I’m doing every second you want throw a party, I won’t bend to your whim anymore, no wonder your old neighbors left they probably hated you, please stop these threats and harassing me and my husband” I was shocked. We have always been cordial enough and I’m very understanding if something is going on in their personal life, if there was an emergency or they are out of town, etc. I responded back asking them if they were gonna remove it. No response and night before the party now, they still haven’t removed it. I have been patient and understanding for years, this week I’m filing an official complaint with police and their landlord. It is apparently illegal in our city to leave any pet feces on public or private property, it’s a serious health and house code violation. Is there anything I should know or do before filing a complaint. I will not be warning them or giving them any heads up. I have given them plenty of time and leeway but they take advantage of it.

We have always been cordial enough and I’m very understanding if something is going on in their personal life, if there was an emergency or they are out of town, etc. I responded back asking them if they were gonna remove it. No response and night before the party now, they still haven’t removed it. I have been patient and understanding for years, this week I’m filing an official complaint with police and their landlord. It is apparently illegal in our city to leave any pet feces on public or private property, it’s a serious health and house code violation. Is there anything I should know or do before filing a complaint. I will not be warning them or giving them any heads up. I have given them plenty of time and leeway but they take advantage of it. I won’t be doing anything petty like egging or TPing so don’t try to suggest that. Thanks to anyone who reads all of this.",0.0,0.012373686,0,1
29,1cvb990,"WIBTA if I bring the ""wrong date"" to a wedding?","I (41F) have an invitation to a friend Wendy's wedding, which includes a Plus 1. This friend is my bestie Amber's younger sister.

I immediately decided to bring my FWB (40M) as my date - he's a great dancer, good with a crowd, and we always have an amazing time together.

I told this to Wendy when we were chatting earlier today. She kinda of made a small face but I brushed it off as something else.

Tonight, I got a call from Amber who asked me why I wasn't bringing my sister as my Plus 1. My sister & I live together, and we are extremely close, we often do things together, so bringing her as my Plus 1 wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility. 

I said that I wanted to bring FWB so I could have a dance partner, not to mention it'll be super fun to get him all dolled up so I can undress him later. He looks good in a suit!

Amber said that Wendy expected me to bring my sister to the wedding, so could I just skip bringing FWB and bring her.

I said no. If Wendy intended my sister to come, she should have either sent a separate invite to her or address 1 single to the two of us specifically rather than to myself and guest.

Apparently Wendy is upset with me and is holding out hope that I won't bring ""some random fuck buddy"" to her wedding.

30,1cvb6bt,AITAH for accidentally getting my neighbor evicted,"So my partner and I have been in our current apt for about 4 years. We had a new upstair neighbor move in about 1year ago. Right away I began noticing tons of cigarette butts and ash on my balcony. For the first few weeks or so I would sweep them up myself (I dont like confrontation) but eventually it started getting worse, cigarette butts, lit cigarettes(one of which burned a hole in our chair cushion, a major fire hazard), teeth flossers, food items and other trash. Once when they were out on their deck my fiance shouted up to them, ""can you please stop dumping your stuff down here?"" They later talked to us and said they accidentally dropped them but we really didnt buy that because there were so many and the variety of stuff that was there. Fast forward to a couple months ago, we began seeing large bags full of trash being thrown down into the woods below often times trash would fall out of the bags and land on our porch. We were also getting tons of dry ceral on our porch(our balconies face thick woods with a creek about 100ft below) anyways we saw this happening pretty often, atleast once a week. We asked them again to please stop throwing trash. They denied it claiming they never threw trash, they're the top floor so unless someone is living on the roof, its them. I would also like to include that our downstairs neighbor also gets tons of garbage, cigarettes and cereal on their balcony. They are just as frustrated as we are. Anyways the upstairs completely denied throwing trash ever. The evidence is visible by looking down off our balcony. Bags, trash all kind of stuff. Plus our downstairs neighbor and us have seen it being thrown with our own eyes. The downstairs neighbor got really mad and went up and full on yelled at them. I dont condone this but I was really hoping they would finally stop. They had this big dramatic reaction, ""OH im SO sorry! I had NO idea, it'll NEVER happen again!"" Cue the next day we see trash being thrown off again, with some landing on our balcony. I finally sent a complaint to our apt manager because it was very frustrating and I was tired of interacting with them. That leads us to today. My partner and I get back from a date and they're outside packing things. They say to us, ""just so you know Ive been given a 30 day notice to vacate, I told you I didnt throw anything.""

Im really shocked. I didnt want them to get kicked out. More a fine or stern talking to just so they would finally stop.

My friend (22m) is not versed on medicine or sexual safety whatsoever. He likes to get around. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but he neglects safety often times. Well one day he called me over the phone and asked me to come over, because he believes he contracted a nasty infection on his junk. I came over and he went on an emotional rant about how he messed up, and he doesn’t know what to do. He said he didn’t want to consult a doctor because, he can’t afford it right now. He started screaming in Spanish (I’m Dominican and he’s Mexican). I asked him his symptoms, and he said there was a bit of a rash and it kind of burned to pee. I told him that if he were to let me take a look, I would be able to tell him if this is anything to worry about, and if he should consult a doctor. He started getting upset and uncomfortable. He said that that’s gay, and he would never do it, and he doesn’t believe I would ever ask that. He asked why I would ever suggest that, and now he’s going to look at me different. Well I’m not sure exactly why he called a MEDICAL STUDENT over his house to complain about a potential illness if he wouldn’t let me assess it.

This friend will be having a birthday dinner at her house, a private omakase chef. She has asked us all to pay for our own dinner (175$ pp) which is pretty normal for omakase, and i enjoy omakase so I don’t mind paying. However, i am now choosing to not attend this party because of her lack of manners. In the trxt she sent inviting she states that she is only inviting close friends and family, but “some people are not eating bc they dont have the finances” - i found the comment rude and tacky, i already find hosting something at your house and making your guest pay for it is tacky but the finances comment shook me. 

This isnt the first incident where i just feel like this friend is bad mannered. Her and her husband are very wealthy or appear to be. (They live in a 5 million dollar home, gated community, she drives a g wagon he drives a rolls royce, always has about 400k of jewelry on including her engagement ring, labels on labels, she loves flaunting their success - nothing rong with that) but she constantly does things that are selfish and lack self awareness it seems and now im reconsidering going to the party at all, because im not sure i want to continue the friendship. I dont feel entitled to he paying for me ever before anyone thinks that. (I have my own successful ful business and live fabulously im just much more lowkey and im aware some people cant even afford to eat right now) 

To me its her lack of self awareness and weirdness. We had another incident a while ago where she made us go to a popular club her husband co owned (a group of about 9 girls - and made us order top shelf bottles. Her husband wasnt there but his friends were and drank most of the bottles) the next day she venmo requests us ($300 each girl to pay) normally my friends that own restaurants or bars they will comp things at times especially ially if THEY invite to host us and its not us just going randomly. This friend is mostly wealthy bc her husband, her other single gf’s dont have near as much financial stability.

For my birthday she got me samples, and for hers i bought her a pretty big gift. Its just the entitlement for me especially wanting people who have less than you to do so much.

39,1cw0wis,"AITA for arguing with my mom after she refused to work out a way to communicate with me, and it ending with her kicking me out?","I (18f) just moved back home from college yesterday. My mom (59f) and my brother (18m) came to pick me up.

The problem started when my mom saw my room and what I was bringing home. I stored my winter clothes, bedding, utensils, allergy meds, and school supplies in a storage unit with friends to cut down the load for the ride home. Despite this, I had a lot of stuff. My mom was upset with the amount I still had. My brother barely put anything in storage, and they hadn't eaten yet, so I excused her reaction bc she was hangry and in pain. It was late when we got home, so I left most of my stuff in the car except to unpack the next morning.

I was up very late, about 3am, which my mom knew because I accidentally woke her up. I’ve had sleep issues since I was 11 and take meds for it, but I forgot to take them with all the moving around. I finally took them at 1am, and they took 2 hours to kick in. I woke up late, and my mom had made brunch. We often don’t eat together as a family, so I assumed it wasn’t a big deal if I ate later (mistake one) and played games for a bit instead (mistake two). Shortly after I woke up, my mom asked me to get the rest of my stuff out of the car and go to the pharmacy to pick up my meds. I didn’t see this as urgent (mistake 3), lost track of time bc I hadn’t taken my ADHD meds yet, and played for another 2 hours (mistake 4).

When I left my room to eat and shower, my mom was very angry, which was understandable given how long I’d made her wait unknowingly. I realized I had messed up and hadn’t been on the same page with her, so I asked her if she could tell me when she wanted things done by. I struggle with tasks that don’t have a set start and end time due to my ADHD, and I hadn’t realized she was waiting around for me. I thought she was resting, as she said she was in pain earlier, which usually means she’ll take pain meds that make her sleepy. She got really mad, saying she ""shouldn’t have to tell me, I should just do it,” and started screaming. I wanted to solve the problem, so it wouldn’t happen again, but she rejected my idea and kept screaming. I started yelling back. Eventually, my brother joined in and told us both to knock it off, especially my mom. I agreed and told my mom, “you lived without us for months, you can do your own damn dishes.” That’s when she said to pack a bag and leave.

AITA? I know I messed up and was oblivious to my mom’s feelings, but I’m also hurt that when I tried finding a solution, she screamed at me. I shouldn’t have said what I did, but is kicking me out a reasonable response?

Since I have to share it, I'm not allowed to upgrade it or put Linux on it. Almost everything seems to be soldered, too. I did get the year he bought it wrong; the sticker said it was manufactured in February 2014. Either way, it's still a very old computer. It was slow when I was a kid, too.

I (14M) live with my uncle. We're poor so I don't have a phone. We have a desktop, but it's very slow because it's a computer he bought in 2012. It won't even run Discord so I can't keep in touch with anybody outside school. I feel so left out of everything, and my social skills are terrible. I'm sick of being stuck in my house all summer and never seeing anybody. (Edit: I'm not allowed to have a phone anyway because he gets by with just a landline fine.)

Anyway, I managed to make a friend at school. He agreed to help me become a more normal person and teach me social skills despite the fact that it was kind of ruining his reputation to associate with me. (I'm not bullied. People just avoid me because I'm weird.)

My friend upgraded to a foldable phone, so I asked him if I could have his old phone. He told me it was super slow and shattered, but I said I didn't mind because it was at least something. He brought it a couple days later and I was mind blown because I never used a touch screen before. He taught me how to use it and I was so happy and grateful.

I tried my best to hide it, but my uncle saw it when he came into my room that night to let me know it was time for bed. He got mad and asked me if I stole his cash. I confessed that I made a friend and he gave it to me. He yelled that my friend's family worked hard for that phone, and that I shouldn't be begging people for free stuff because it'll make them think I'm a bum or homeless.

In the end, I had to factory reset the phone and give it back to my friend on Friday after having it for only a day.

44,1cw08md,AITA for refusing to pay transport on my friend’s vacation,"My friends and I (5 girls) started planning our small trip 3 months ago to a vacation home close to the beach in our country. I should preface by saying they are in an entirely different tax bracket (rich white with family owned business) and I am part of a single mom household where my mother works minimum wage. About a month ago we started the discussion of transport and we decided to start looking at different options for a driver. For the first driver contacted, for our 5 day stay we would be paying $100 USD each. I said this was a bit much and I would have to ask my mother (we are all still 17-19 living with our parents) they said it’s just one option and they are still looking for other options. Reminder this was a month ago. 

About a week ago, I messaged my friend who is organizing the driver, let’s call her Cece, to find out the prices we are looking at, she took a week to reply and then last night on our group chat she said we all need to pay $100 for the driver. 

My other friend, Allie, agreed that this was too much, the area is quite far away and she happens to be the only one of us who lives there, thus, her mom offered to drive us to the beach while we are there    This was a much better option to me, and we decided to bring it up. I asked my friends if we could consider this option instead and I told them that $100 is too much. They were extremely angry that I wasn’t going to be paying for the driver and they said they were in an uncomfortable situation because they “feel bad” for Allie’s mom and they don’t want to ask her to pick them up. They said they will try to find another driver for just the 3 of them or pay for that driver themselves. 

Although our trip is a month away they said they won’t be able to find a good driver, however I know this is not the case as there are several options for drivers in this area and they just refuse to look into other options. They keep saying I told them last minute which really inconveniences them and I should’ve said something earlier, however in my opinion I was clear that i wasn’t sure abt that price. 

They started telling me to get a job and to make a resume, I was really offended as none of them work and they live off their parents money, secondly it would be impossible for me to get a job for only a month especially when I am currently writing A’levels. Why should I work to use my entire earnings for one trip when there is an easier option?

They can either choose the free option, find another driver or stick with this driver and pay $166 instead of $100. 

I feel bad that I may have inconvenienced them but I somewhat feel that I truly did nothing wrong and it felt like they were attacking me for being poor at some points. 

EDIT- 

I definitely should have mentioned this earlier but the reason I did not suggest other options is because of the way they were speaking to me. Eg. telling me to get a job, saying I should be more aware of my financial situation etc. I felt pretty discouraged and the conversation didn’t feel very solution oriented it just felt like they were attacking me. 

I instead clarified that I wasn’t forcing them to pay that money and they were free to come with Allie’s mom, in the case that they did not want to do that under any circumstances I found them a few other options for 3 of them and said that Allie and I would go with her mother. These options ranged from $108-$115. 

The reason I didn’t mention this earlier was because my main point was that they were acting as if I am pulling out of plans last minute when in reality, in my opinion, the plans weren’t concrete and I had made it clear i wasn’t confirmed to be paying $100 from the beginning.

45,1cw07ov,AITA for being stubborn in wanting to go to a good gluten free restaurant ,"
I (18F) recently changed my diet and i had to go gluten free due to a new health development. my family has been relatively supportive, but it’s still a hard adjustment to make. I’m not deathly allergic, but i’m in a lot of pain whenever i eat something  with gluten in it.

Today, my dad suggested going to a restaurant near us, as he didn’t want to cook. I said i didn’t like the restaurant because of its lack of gluten free options (1 GF menu item total that i hated) and suggested other places in town. (8 minutes away by car)

He said he didn’t want to go into town as he was tired, and didn’t want to make it into an “adventure” to get me food. I got upset because i don’t feel like it’s that big of a deal to actually accommodate me, and becoming gluten free has been really hard on me. 

He said it’s not an option to go to those places, and he’ll just go with my brother to the closer place and just not take me. After i got mad at this, he said i don’t care about his stress and that fine, we’ll just go wherever i want.

I (18F) recently changed my diet and i had to go gluten free due to a new health development. my family has been relatively supportive, but it’s still a hard adjustment to make. I’m not deathly allergic, but i’m in a lot of pain whenever i eat something  with gluten in it.

Today, my dad suggested going to a restaurant near us, as he didn’t want to cook. I said i didn’t like the restaurant because of its lack of gluten free options (1 GF menu item total that i hated) and suggested other places in town. (8 minutes away by car)

He said he didn’t want to go into town as he was tired, and didn’t want to make it into an “adventure” to get me food. I got upset because i don’t feel like it’s that big of a deal to actually accommodate me, and becoming gluten free has been really hard on me. 

He said it’s not an option to go to those places, and he’ll just go with my brother to the closer place and just not take me. After i got mad at this, he said i don’t care about his stress and that fine, we’ll just go wherever i want.

46,1cw0181,WIBTA for giving away a handmade quilt from my grandma?,"I’ll try to make the context as short as possible. 

I was abused as a child. As a teenager, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with a rare disorder that stems from repeated abuse. There is no other possible cause of my condition. I assumed up until now that my extended family did not know of this as it is considered a great shame in my immediate family, who were my abusers. 

Although I do not know them well and only saw them about once or twice a year during my childhood, I was always very fond of my grandma who was very kind to me. A few years ago, she sent me a beautiful handmade quilt that clearly took a lot of time and effort- I was surprised by this as we had not spoken in a very long time. I took this as an opportunity to get in contact and try to get to know her better. 

Fast forward a couple of months and my condition has flared up again due to life stressors and became severe enough that I had to take a leave from work. At this point I confessed to her I had this illness and she said that she knew of it since I was diagnosed, and that she could never figure out what caused it. I told her I was abused and she told me we “shouldn’t talk about something so serious right now in my state” and that she felt there is “a lot of hurt on both sides” with my accusations. She said that my abusers always spoke very highly of me.

She is now sick and very old. The quilt she made is so intricate that it took several years to make and I can tell it was made with care. I also think she meant well in what she said and was well meaning in trying to get me back in contact with my family and had good intentions as she thinks they are kind people.

I think I might be the asshole because she stitched it just for me and it clearly took a lot of care but every time I see it I remember that she didn’t believe me.

47,1cvzxbd,AITA for starting a fight with my fiancé after unexpectedly bringing his friend over at our apartment at 2:30am and saw me half-naked?,"My fiancé (30) and his friend knew each other before I came into the picture. I've known him for almost five years.

The more I hear, the more convinced I am that he's incapable of making decisions or plans for his life. More often than not, my fiancé would complain about how incompetent he is as well after hanging out with him and how it annoys him. 

The more I hear these from my fiancé and other friends, the more convinced I am that he is a walking baggage. 

Fast forward to today, my fiancé went out to drink with him. They were out for four hours. I strictly told my fiancé that his friend couldn't come over because it was late, and I have a bad impression of him (he talked badly about me to my fiancé). It’s common decency not to come over late since my fiancé doesn’t live alone. My fiancé called me at 2:30 am to open the door. I thought he was coming home alone, but I heard movement in the living room. I walked in and saw his friend there at 2:40 am, and he saw me half-naked.

Furious, I walked back to the bedroom, and my fiancé followed me. I told him to kick his friend out because I did not find this funny. He didn't and made me wait 30-40 minutes until his friend left. With each passing minute, I became more upset. Not only was I not informed that his friend would be coming over, but my fiancé defended him by saying, ""He didn't see anything, I asked him. It's fine."" He also said he messaged me that his friend was coming over, but I didn’t realize it until he pointed it out during the argument.

Normally, I reply immediately. If I don't, he usually double-checks, but he didn't this time. He was blaming me for not checking the message, but he knows I'm normally not awake at 2:30 am. I forgot my keys at the office, so I had to open the door for him, and I could only attend to his calls, not messages, because I was starting to fall asleep.

He kept defending that I saw the message and assumed it was okay for his friend to come over. He's been dating me for five years and knows I would message him back straight away. If I didn't, he would call me and double-check.

He kept telling me it wasn't a big deal that his friend saw me half-naked because he firmly believed and confirmed that he didn't see anything and that I was being overdramatic. I got really furious because I told him that his friend and I locked eyes and he looked away quickly. He can't convince me otherwise.

More than being half-naked, am I the asshole for fighting with my fiancé because he brought his friend over at 2:30 am? I was expecting him to come home alone so we could both sleep. He kept telling me that his friend is nice, but a nice friend wouldn't ask to come over so late. He wasn't even invited. He asked if he could come over, and my fiancé stupidly said yes. Right now, I feel disgusted at myself and I feel violated. Are my feelings valid?

48,1cvzuz6,"AITA For asking that my roommate to clean up dog waste, in response to her asking me to stop smoking. ","I am going to be as up front and honest about this situation in an effort to get the most honest judgement I can. I \[M25\] moved in with my roommate \[F28\] about 9 months ago. We talked on Facebook Marketplace, and I came to view the place and meet her dog. Her dog is very nice, and I have always had pets, so I was of course okay with moving in with an animal. I also mentioned to her that I smoke marijuana, to deal with my depression. When I informed her that I smoked before moving in, she said it was okay, as she often smoked at times too, though she smoked hookah.  I am located in California, where the drug is legal, HOWEVER, our apartment complex is no smoking. At the time, I only smoked outside, and would do so after work and the gym, after eating. 

When moving in, I rented a steam cleaner from Home Depot to clean the carpets, as there were several stains, I cleaned the whole living room, and my own room. As mentioned above, I would smoke on the back patio, but then the dog started to use the bathroom on the floor right in front of the doorway outside. She would occasionally put out pee pads, but they were often covered and would stay that way for a while, soaking through the carpet below, so I started to smoke in my room. I would smoke with the window on, and a fan pointed at the window. 

  
After a bit of time, she asked me to smoke outside again, and made the claim that it was making the dog sick. This was despite her smoking hookah in front of the dog with her friends. Admittedly, after she complained, she stopped smoking hookah entirely. I said that I would smoke outside if she would clean up the dogs mess that was in the way of getting out, and she told me that I knew I was moving in with a dog when I moved in, and that I should just step over it, or not smoke at all. 

  
I understand that the apartment is non smoking, and that she had stopped smoking as well, so I said that I would stop smoking all together in the apartment at all, including outside, if she would clean up the dogs mess so that I could sit in the living room and not have to smell it, but she remained vigilant on the fact that ""I moved in with a dog so I should have expected it"". When I asked her if she could leave the back door open for the dog to use the restroom outside, she said that he might eat something that will make him sick out there. She will leave him at home for the whole day while she works, and he is trained to use the bathroom on the floor. 

  
I found out from the leasing office that she has had 12 roommates over the course of 5 years, and she yelled at me to find another roommate and move out, which I am happy to do. As a kicker, during this screaming match, she not only threw a dog toy at me (was a soft plush, no injury), and told me to ""never acknowledge the dog again"", which I was fine to do, but seems like... brutal to the dog who had no involvement in any of this.

49,1cvzsop,AITA for leaving my cousin's baby shower event early,"M30 here. I have a feeling this post is mild as hell compared to other stuff here. But whatever

Today was the baby shower of my cousin (F) and I attended, even though I genuinely did not want to go because I hate these sort of events with a lot of people I don't know (I've been diagnosed with sever social anxiety disorder). I told myself that I was just going to be there for a few hours and I was going to leave early. Once there, the anxiety kicked in pretty early, and I already wanted to leave, but I still thought it'd be decent of me to stay for a few hours. There were some activities and it was all fun, but 3 hours in we got to the time to eat, and I took it as an opportunity to leave. I went to tell my cousin I was leaving, and she responded by being semi-humorous and asking ""What? With who's permission are you leaving?"". But then her face turned all serious and disappointed and I was just confused. I responded, also semi-humorous, ""well with my own permission"", but felt so awkward. Then she was sort expecting some explaination. I blurted out that I was leaving ""because I had stuff to do"". Which is a lie, and I didn't even want to say that, but I did for some reason. Then she was like ""Oh well, ok"", in a very disappointed demeanor. I said goodbye to her husband and he was more chill about it. And I left. 

Now I'm sitting here at home, overthinking about leaving early what was a very significant event for her and wondering if I should've just sucked it up and stayed for a while longer. Aside from this, it's a bit frustrating because I've always been a people pleaser, and it's something I'm trying to work on without turning into a complete asshole.

I found Gray to be judgemental, but tried to see past it as her anxiety. Gray also used to have feelings for Cam in high school (before my time) which were not returned. This did make me wary of Gray in the beginning but once Sal came into the picture that was in the past. Regardless, I was nice and didnt try to return negative energy.

Gray shared a few yrs ago that she was upset about Cam and Sal friendship since they had become closer than Gray and Cam. 

Recently Gray and Sal came to visit for a concert and avoided us the whole weekend up until the last minute when we were all at our seats. Next time, they avoided coming to our house until Cam convinced them. Later an invite for their wedding (in our state not theirs) was sent and I was not included. Gray made it clear to Cam and a mutual friend (who had no SO) that there were no +1. At first I was hurt but I rationalized that it was a small wedding. 

Then more info came out. Early in dating, Gray told Cam that I ignored her and didn't think I liked her. Cam explained at the time that it was unlikely that I ignored her and I probably didn't hear since we were at a festival. I'm also a quiet person who isn't super excitable about most things which is understandably off-putting if you're used to bubbly women. Recently I think I have improved my socialization to be more welcoming. Apparently too much. The friend one drunken evening said Gray felt I talked too much to Sal on their last visit, and that she doesn't like me because I don't like her. I remember this visit bc Cam and Gray were talking old HS days, so I spoke to S about medical school because I find it interesting. I do remember lots of judgemental comments being made by Gray which I probably diverted away by asking Sal more questions. 

Putting all together makes sense why she was avoiding us on the last trips. These are all things I was willing to set aside and deal if they visit. Then Gray said she's moving to our city after the wedding but Sal will move to different state for his med match. Gray has few ppl here. I fear that Gray will be around alot as it's nice to have a support system in a new place when alone. 

I spoke with Cam that I felt uncomfortable with Gray. That to her I am just a +1, and mean girl who is intentionally being unwelcome. I put a lot of intention in my 20s to be a kind person bc I don't want to make people feel bad. I was conscious about Gray and S being vegetarian and choose food/restaurants with lots of veg options. I had talked to Cam that Sal should talk with Gray about information that was important for her to know. 

I don't have time in my life for someone like this and if it were up to me, I would move on and go about my happy life. Cam really enjoys spending time with Sal but agrees that he doesn't like how Gray is acting. WIBTA for asking Cam to minimize interactions with Gray and therefore Sal?

52,1cvzjes,AITA for leaving when my father surprised us with his new gf?,"My father and I never had the best relationship but in the past it was ok. He is by far the closest member of my family.

I became a mother last year and was slightly disappointed when my father was more busy with his new (and now former) GF than visiting my daughter. He also brought without asking her seven day after I gave birth when we invited him. At that time I was confused and also a bit angry but for the sake of peace I didn't say anything. However they broke up a few months later.

Since the beginning of the new year my father mentioned a new gf. It was a busy and stressful year for me with my child and work related stuff. So I never met his new partner.

Last week my dad invited us for diner. Before that day we had a fight about some stuff that was really important for me (throwing away stuff from my grandpa I wanted to keep after he died early last year).  This hurt me a lot that he didn't think about it.After the fight I cancelled the diner invite. My dad was really disappointed and asked me to change my mind. After some discussion with my husband we decided to go but I called my dad before to talk about the fight. He seemed to understand me and I said we will come. At the end of the call he said he will have a surprise guest: his new girlfriend. I said I wanted to know about this before and don't think it is the right time to meet. I proposed that we should have diner this week but without any surprise guest just him and my husband and child. He agreed.

Today we visited my father for diner. At first he apologized for his behavior last week because the stuff he throw away. I said that I accept this and that it was not the right time to meet his new partner or any surprise guest. His new gf suddenly came out of the kitchen.

My father and I never had the best relationship but in the past it was ok. He is by far the closest member of my family.

I became a mother last year and was slightly disappointed when my father was more busy with his new (and now former) GF than visiting my daughter. He also brought without asking her seven day after I gave birth when we invited him. At that time I was confused and also a bit angry but for the sake of peace I didn't say anything. However they broke up a few months later.

Since the beginning of the new year my father mentioned a new gf. It was a busy and stressful year for me with my child and work related stuff. So I never met his new partner.

Last week my dad invited us for diner. Before that day we had a fight about some stuff that was really important for me (throwing away stuff from my grandpa I wanted to keep after he died early last year).  This hurt me a lot that he didn't think about it.After the fight I cancelled the diner invite. My dad was really disappointed and asked me to change my mind.

53,1cvzits,AITA for not forcing my cousin to go back to the family hike?,"I (26M) am on vacation together with some of my family, and yesterday we wanted to go on a hike. One of my cousins (23M) is autistic and (I think) he also has some intellectual disability.

We weren’t super far along the way yet, but he had to use the bathroom. Some of my family got a little annoyed because, obviously, we had barely started the hike. His parents suggested he should just go in the bushes or trees somewhere, but he really did not want that. He insisted on it and got frustrated, but he wasn’t allowed to go back to the hotel alone. I felt bad for him, so I offered to go with him.

The plan was that the rest would wait until we came back. However, he ended up peeing his pants. We went back to the hotel room so he could clean up, which was a hassle because he was very stressed and I found it hard to communicate with him. He needed a little help with calming down and some guidance, but that worked out eventually. 

The problem started when I got a text from my aunt (his mom) asking if we were almost there again, and my cousin made it very clear that he did not want to go back. They basically wanted me to just force him to go, because “he’ll enjoy it when he’s there”. I asked him one more time, but he was upset and really didn’t want to. She didn’t like that I didn’t push it further.

They, again, didn’t feel comfortable with him being left alone, so I didn’t go back either. I didn’t tell them what happened exactly because that felt unfair towards him. Maybe they would’ve been more understanding if I had. Afterwards people were frustrated with me for not pushing my cousin to go and making them wait. I understand it may have ruined the mood.

54,1cvzgft,AITA for considering breaking up with my(29F) car obsessed bf(28M)? ,"Hello everyone, I would just like some genuine judgement here since I can’t wait for our next couples therapy and my mind is spinning in all places. 

Sorry for bad english, not my mother language.

So for a background, I’ve been in and out of a relationship with my bf for various reasons. The first time he broke up with me after 1,5 years of relationship because he felt he needed more freedom in his life, then begged for me back after 4 weeks. The second time we broke up it was for a longer time and it happened due to his too friendly friendship with his female coworker. 

Now the most recent problem that botbers me is that, during our almost three year relationship he‘s been driving sportcars, all of them BMW, and he’s very active in the BMW drivers community. He spends almost every weekend meeting with other drivers or just his friends who admire his car and make photoshootings etc, I get how exciting that is for boys, but it came to the point that he cant make any plans with me, because he’s already busy centerpoint being his car.

I am sick and tired of this boyish behaviour and he promised too many times he will set me as his priority but I just don’t see any improvements… 

My fault in this is how I react when Im upset and cant explain my feelings peacefully but in an upset and loud tone. 

I recommended separating indefinitely but he says I need to find hobbies and let him enjoy his. 
I could do that if he’d make balance in our relationship and spend as much time with me as with his car or car related activities but it’s not an option because he doesn’t have enough money after paying for so much gas. 

Today is Sunday and he got up early today to go to a car show and still not at home at almost midnight and I don’t know what to think. 
I may be jealous of his car. I don’t know how I should communicate my feelings so he understands its more important to spend time with your loved ones who may not be there anymore tomorrow.

57,1cvz7fc,AITA for taking my best friend’s ex’s “side” in their breakup,"This was several years ago, but the situation breaks my heart to this day, so I’d like some outside perspectives. 
I had been very very close friends with, I’ll call her “S”, for YEARS when this happened. She had been dating her girlfriend, “R”, for 4 years. I knew S wasn’t completely happy in the relationship. When COVID happened, S, who worked at school that shut down, spiraled a bit. I had become quite close with R over the course of their relationship over the years as well. 
S at some point stayed out all night with another girl, “G”, leaving R concerned and confused. S didn’t admit at the time she was with someone else but eventually did. She never did admit to physically cheating but I feel strongly that’s probably what happened. When S finally broke up with R, R was devastated and S asked me to come to their place to console R. R started leaning on me through the breakup after that first night. 
I’d always thought of S as a good person- selfless, caring, strong morals. But after the breakup, they became someone I didn’t recognize. She moved G and her child into the house while R was still living there and had no regard for R’s feelings. They would write messages to each other about how in love they were on the whiteboard that was in the kitchen. One of them once wrote “I love the way you taste when you cum” on this whiteboard. G would leave underwear and bras around. They’d kiss in front of the windows while R was clearly right inside, with a full view. R would try to initiate conversations about various things like boundaries, and S would say “im not having this conversation in front of G’s child” and at one point followed R upstairs to continue an argument after using this line and R had responded “okay, I’ll leave then since at least one of us should respect boundaries.” At that point G wrote R a note basically saying you’re never to speak like that in front of my child again. The last straw came when S and G packed up everything belonging to R when R wasn’t home and shoved it into her room. She was already moving at this point, but did this without her knowledge or consent. S had taken a lamp from R’s bedside that did technically belong to S, but she never used it and R asked if she could continue to use it until she moved out, to which S replied “no, I don’t want you touching any of my things”. I went and talked to S to basically ask what was going on. What the conversation boiled down to was I told her I was so sad to see her acting so cruelly because that wasn’t the person I’d known for so long. She basically told me I didn’t know everything, R had done things that were also wrong, she was tired of always putting other people first, and I should’ve been on her side as one of her best friends. She was right, I wasn’t on her side, because I just couldn’t support anyone behaving the way she had been.

We live in different cities, but I visit him for 2-3 days every week. From the very beginning Bob adored me, respected me, supported me in tough times, always answered my calls, texted me daily, introduced me to his friends, took care of my sexual needs. His family also liked me very much. After 1.5 years not much has changed. However, for the past two months I've been feeling different in this relationship.

The issue is cleaning. I'm a person who can't function normally if there's a mess around me. I need everything to be in its proper place, garbage thrown out, dishes in the dishwasher, clothes in the laundry basket, and dust wiped away. Otherwise, I can't study, work or be productive. Bob, on the other hand, doesn't care about the mess at all. He likes it best when everything is out in the open. Trash, plastic bottles, dirty dishes, dust, dirty clothes on the floor, and clean ones thrown and stuffed in the closet. In desperation, I cleaned his place thoroughly several times. He would promise to keep it tidy but after three weeks everything looked the same as before. He supposedly cleans every week before I arrive but that means doing 10-50% of what I expect. This causes the situation to look worse week by week.

He knows my needs and what needs to be cleaned before I arrive (if he did it every week, it would take him 10 minutes) but he doesn't care. He says that we have different definitions of cleanliness and f.ex. that desk, for him, is clean. Since this is the only ""difficult"" thing I ask him to do, I feel that by not cleaning, he's showing me a lack of respect. I know he can clean but he doesn't want to.

Recently, I decided that if he doesn't meet my needs, I shouldn't feel obligated to meet his. The difference between our needs is that he diminishes mine, but I don't diminish his. That's why I often give in to him, and he says that I'm overreacting. I’m not. The mess at home has a very big, negative impact on my well-being, and right now, I see no possibility of living with Bob in the future.

This whole situation causes me excessive irritation. I get upset over many small comments or behaviors. I don't have the strength to argue with him anymore.

The reason why Mark and his wife are divorcing is because (according to Mark) she has let herself go. He has said she has gained a lot of weight (I have noticed that, but like I didn't really care), she stopped going to the gym, starting smoking, cut off her hair due to not caring to take care of it anymore, etc. When I told my wife of this, she just made a face and said that it was ""trashy"" of him to leave his wife in what may be hard times in her life. I understand that, but like, my friend said that he had tried therapy for her, marriage counselling, and antidepressants (she was actually diagnosed depressed) but she didn't really seem to want to help herself. 

Honestly, I can get behind that. But my wife's mood always shifts whenever I bring him up now, and doesn't like the fact that I'm helping him through the divorce (it's taking a toll on both of them equally imo).

My classmate 15(f) often uses this to go home early. Let's call her Emma (Fake name). So I take seizures in school as i am on there most often. Emma likes to use this to go home. She was ranting to other people in my form class last week about how scary it is to witness a seziure and that she gets so much anxiety so she has to go home. The thing is i would understand that she was scared but everyone is so focused on her i get little help.

For example i had hurt my head while having a seizure. I had minor bleeding but i was still bleeding and Emma was crying and nobody was there to help me. 

I got frustrated when she came up to me the next day and said ""It was so scary seeing you have a seizure. This happens so often. You need to take better care of yourself and realise your harming others too."" I lost it and said ""alteast i dont go home after seeing/,hearing about my seizures.""

63,1cvymaz,AITA for being difficult with my gf when she was trying to do something nice for me?,"We are arguing now and I hate how it's devolved to this.

My girlfriend and I came into some money recently and we decided we were going to buy me a new desk for my room. I decided to look into some options on my own. I didn't know that my girlfriend was doing her own research. Yesterday I told her the desk I wanted and it was a desk going for $289.00 from IKEA. My girlfriend found a similar desk at another place going for $399. 

I told my girlfriend that I would prefer to go with my option because it looks like it fits my room better, the colour works (it comes in 3 different colours) and it just looks better. She told me that the one she found was better and it was interesting because the design has patterns. I told her that I didn't really like the one she found (it only comes in brown), it's more expensive and IKEA is just down the street from us. She says the desk is better and the company does delivery and she doesn't think IKEA does deliveries. 

This is where we got into the argument. I told her it didn't matter about the choice because it's for me and my room and I would like to have a desk that I want. She told me I was diminishing her opinion and told me I was being difficult and she had a complete vision for how she saw my set up would be. I told her she can't have her own vision for my room, it's the only place in our house I am allowed to decorate on my own. She told me I needed to stop and just let her do something nice for me. I told her to drop the whole thing. If she can't accept my decision for what sort of desk I want then I don't want a desk from her. 

She isn't talking to me now. I was thinking about how to apologize but I really don't feel like I have anything to apologize about.

64,1cvyjuo,AITA because I plan to rescind my invitation to take my mother on vacation?,"
I spent $3000 on a vacation at a resort that is about 3 hours away. I rented a place large enough to accommodate my mom (good health for 72) and younger brother who lives with her. My brother was looking forward to the trip several weeks ago, and like a light switch, their attitudes have shifted, and we are one week away from leaving. 

I have three older teenagers and a husband who are also going. I called my mom yesterday afternoon, and the excuses started. She said, “ I haven’t found anyone to take care of my cat.”  Do you think (my daughter) will be able to take some friends?  Has she talked to her cousin about going?”  I’m like, “No, why would she?”  She had me on speaker, and my brother then said, “I’ll stay back because I need to work on my RV, and I can keep the cat.”  My mom giggled and said, “He doesn’t really want to go.”  

With a crushed heart (because clearly the message I got was that my family and I aren’t enough for them), I told her I need to go and would talk to her later. She then texted that she would still be going, and my brother would stay back to take care of his cat.  I responded with, “Don’t feel pressured to go. I have spent a lot of time and money on this vacation and don’t appreciate it being treated like it’s an option at this point.”  She then said, “You know I’m planning to go or I wouldn’t have reserved a golf cart.”

They called several times, and I ignored them. I am used to her rejection and always choosing others and things ahead of me.  I don’t know why I would expect less from her. She visits the area where my daughter, her granddaughter, goes to college and never makes an effort to see her. She comes to visit me maybe once a year.  I’m about 40 minutes away.

My husband thinks I should tell her to come or not come depending on what she wants to do. However, I no longer want her on this vacation.  Her words caused damage, and I need space for healing.  I love my mom, but the rejection has happened my whole life, and I’m ready for change. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-19,"AITA because I plan to rescind my invitation to take my mother on vacation?

65,1cvyjgc,AITA for ignoring my (F21) mom (F45) for two days because of her not letting me go to comic con dressed as Tifa from final fantasy?,"The title should say enough as TL;DR. The longer story is that my bf and I, as well as his friends attended a smaller, more east asian media oriented convention months ago, where he and I cosplayed as Misa and Light a little last minute, but still enjoyed ourselves. Now, the bigger variant would be next month, and my bf (M22) wanted to attend again. My bf and I have talked about this for months, and even when he was over at my birthday, we talked about cosplaying as something I really liked again, just as a way to make it an enjoyable experience for both parties (he's more into the convention thing, and I am into fashion). 

So, a few days ago I brought up we should go in june again, to my bf, since nobody at home was really against it and said it'd be fun (I live with my mom and sister, as well as her kid—my nephew). That same day I showed my mom and sister a couple of outfits that Tifa wears, which they said is actually cool, especially my sister (who liked her cowboy one most) cos she plays the games too. Fast forward, my bf gets two tickets, so I'm showing my mom again; hey, I have tickets now, this is what we want to go as. She suddenly starts saying the outfit is too slutty, etc. i said I'd wear safety shorts and my pleated skirt would be longer anyway, as well as the crop top, so she wouldn't have to worry about it, especially because in real life I wear short stuff too. She calls me names, says me going one time was enough, keeps going at it, and I say ""okay then I won't go"". She keeps this whole thing up, so I just decide to go to my room and close myself up, because I know arguing against her will leave me outside with nothing for hours again (speaking from experience), and I just can't be bothered. 

I do the same today, because I just don't understand her problem, she says I shouldn't have allowed my bf to buy tickets before I got consent over what to wear. Which, fair, because I'm middle eastern and that put me in the luck of needing consent for everything, which is where I think I'm the asshole, as well as for ignoring her. But at the same time, I feel like it's completely reasonable I got upset over this too?

I don't party, go out, not even with friends, on dates I constantly text my mom so she knows I am not ""doing anything wrong"" (as well as me trying to get home early always, and 5 pm already gets her screaming off of her lungs that it's late), I get good grades and only occpuy myself with work and school. I've had recitals for my own music, she's never attended one. At the same time, she polices my body and what I do, and even though I live under her roof, which makes me TA in this situation in her opinion, wouldn't I still be allowed some? Liberty? I feel like a 15 year old asshole even crying about this idk... AITA?

69,1cvxzlm,AITA for having a no children under 10 rule at my vow renewal?,"Hello all, I (40F) and my husband (41M) have been married 20 years, and our children (twins F and M) are 14 this year. 

We decided to get our vows renewed, as we got married at 20 and are now 20 years into marriage, we have spent half our lives together and the milestone lining up with our ages is cute. 

We did not have the most grand wedding as we were both college students at the time, and as such have decided to host a more upscale party (not a wedding, we are renting a nice venue and getting a great caterer). It's more for the symbolic value than re-doing our wedding. 

We've invited a lot of our family, including my sister (35F) and my brother in law (33M) - they both have young children with their partners (sister's is currently 6, brother in law's is 4.) and we have asked them to not bring them to the event. 

We set this rule as there will be drinking, music, and the venue has quite a few areas that are restricted, and we don't think it would be good to have children under ten there with all of us. (we plan on having 23 guests, as those are all that have rsvp'd)

My sister was upset, as the venue has a large garden and an indoor aviary and butterfly raising facility, and her daughter loves butterflies. My BIL was also a bit upset, but more towards finding a babysitter (even though the event is 3 months out as of now)

Well, my sister and BIL have seemed to form a group and, upon learning that our cousin, who has a 10yo, will be bringing the 10yo, they have gotten quite angry and aggressive with us, asking us to let them come with their kids or they won't show up.

My mother is very lax and has on multiple occassions told my sister she's being unreasonable, but my sister thinks ""no children under 10"" rule should include the 10 year old, and has begun saying she thinks we dislike her daughter. 

My husband is quite averse to confrontation and has told me he doesn't care if his brother comes or not.

Meanwhile, our kids are also not helping the situation. My daughter, in trying to be helpful, told my sister she would make a scrapbook of photos from the venue for her daughter, which only aggrivated my sister further. My son, in also trying to help, offerred to stay home and watch both of the kids, which made my BIL start piping up about how my son shouldn't have to stay home because we can't change our rule.

I do want my sister and my BIL to be there, but i also think they're being ridiculous. I have even offerred to pay for babysitting and have gotten turned down. I think they're too far seated in their commitment to getting us to break down the rule than they are to accept a peace offering.

72,1cvxpes,AITA for asking my MIL to wear a different dress to my wedding.,"My wedding is coming up soon and my fiancé and I are very excited for it. On our wedding website, I had requested that guests try their best to wear fall-toned clothing (mauve, burgundy, emerald, burnt orange, browns, mustard yellow, etc). I'm not going to be kicking people out for not abiding by the dress code by any means, I just thought having the guests in a somewhat cohesive tone would look nice in photos because even though it is a spring wedding, I love fall and fall colors. 

I had mentioned to my mother in law a few times  that my step-mom and grandma (who are standing in as the MoB) will be wearing dark sapphire blue and I'd like it if she could follow suit. She had also even asked me what color, she should wear months and months ago and the answer was the same then. Yesterday she showed me the dress she had got and it was not at all what I had thought she would wear. The dress is a very light champagne color and admittedly...it almost looks like a wedding dress. It doesn't look like my dress, per se, but it still looks pretty bridal to me.

I felt really uncomfortable when I realized I'd either have to deal with it or make the request for her to change what she planned on wearing. If the dress was a different color that fit the scheme we requested I would have been fine with it, but because it looks pretty bridal, I honestly am not happy with it at all. So I asked her politely if she would mind wearing one of the blue dresses that I know she has from when my fiancé's sisters both got married and she was clearly let down by my request. She said the dress was only $30 but I'm not sure if I'm over stepping or within my rights to make this request. 

I found a similar dress on Amazon that I'll try to attach to the post. The only difference is that her dress is a tad lighter in color and it just has straps (no sleeves), with more of a sweetheart neckline.

This is a fair that happens annually in my city and pets are encouraged to join. I gave my dog a bone, so she’d stay preoccupied and not mess up my display. My dog is the sweetest, she will kiss strangers and she never makes a peep, however if she has a bone she may protect it verbally, never attacking though, so just growling and then moving away from the person. 

When we were sitting by my display, my dog was right beside me on short leash eating her bone, a girl (10ish) came up from behind us trying to pet my dog. When my dog sensed someone moving behind us she immediately jumped up with bone in mouth and growled at the girl in warning. This was the first time I noticed the girl. She hadn’t asked me if she could pet my dog or approach us, but her hand was outstretched toward my dog and she was kneeling down. Now I apologized to her for my dog growling and said the dog isn’t mean just protective of the bone, and then I told her to always ask permission before approaching a dog not just show up behind the owner without warning. The girl looked a bit shaken but she left after I told her this. 

Not 10min later her mother comes storming over demanding I control my beastly dog. At this point my dog had finished her bone and was napping next to me, calm as can be. I was a bit baffled but then she said I had scared her kid and that I should never have told her kid off. I repeated the events to the mother and expressed concern that her kid approaches unfamiliar dogs without permission or even acknoledgement of her presence.

I should have rethought the bone, I was mainly thinking of it making my life easier when setting up (selfish I know).

My (F17) mom (F44) has recently had financial problems. I'm not sure of all the ins and outs but it meant we could no longer afford to live at home.

My wife has not had a paying job since we got engaged 16 years ago. 7 years ago, I quit my ""change the world"" job, which paid little, but conferred distinction and a sense of doing what is right -- for a mercenary, awful job I hate, but which pays 10 times as much.

My wife enthusiastically supported, indeed urged, my job change to the higher paying but awful job. For a while I held it all in, but over time, particularly recently, I've told her clearly that this job is leading me to an early grave. It is awful the people and crap I deal with every day. It is immensely stressful and not rewarding in the least. But of course, as the pay rolled in, our standard of living increased, and the amount we spend each month is eye-watering.

Last night, at a cocktail party with my friends, my wife got drunk, and on the way home, tearfully told me that I ""just don't understand her,"" and that what she ""truly needs to feel fulfilled is a horse."" We know many people with horses. After a few questions, where she kept replying that this horse or that ""wasn't good enough for her,"" our discussion devolved into shouting.

I view this as a pretty simple thing. I want to go back to a job I like some day. I'd like to reduce our spending so I don't need to work until I'm 80.  My son wants to visit Madagascar.  My point is that people's wants, practical (not working until I'm 80 in an awful job) or impractical (visiting Madagascar) are often placed aside.

Also FYI - I don't have any hobbies.  So it's not like I'm spending money on cars or something and then telling her that she can't.

I should add that we live in the suburbs of a big city. We do not have a backyard where a horse can graze. We would need to first buy a special breed of horse she demands for tens of thousands of dollars, pay for feed, veterinary, stable, insurance, etc. We're talking HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars. Another stone in my backpack.  Basically guaranteeing that I will never be able to do anything else.

I view this as her saying, in so many terms: Well \*I\* want to be fulfilled; but I don't give a shit about your stress and fulfillment.

I view this as a pretty simple thing. I want to go back to a job I like some day. I'd like to reduce our spending so I don't need to work until I'm 80.  My son wants to visit Madagascar.  My point is that people's wants, practical (not working until I'm 80 in an awful job) or impractical (visiting Madagascar) are often placed aside.

Also FYI - I don't have any hobbies.  So it's not like I'm spending money on cars or something and then telling her that she can't.

I should add that we live in the suburbs of a big city. We do not have a backyard where a horse can graze. We would need to first buy a special breed of horse she demands for tens of thousands of dollars, pay for feed, veterinary, stable, insurance, etc. We're talking HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars. Another stone in my backpack.  Basically guaranteeing that I will never be able to do anything else.

I view this as her saying, in so many terms: Well \*I\* want to be fulfilled; but I don't give a shit about your stress and fulfillment.

Before I give the story, let me give you some background context. I’m 16 years old and the groom is my cousin who I’m very close with and I have just recently met his bride. A couple minor things happen when we first met. For example, one time she was braiding my hair and she told me something backhanded like “oh my gosh, your hair is soo thin. Like your braid is so tiny. When I braid my hair it’s so thick.” Its not necessarily mean, but it’s just something that I feel like wasn’t necessary to say. There was also another incident where I was at my other cousins wife’s bridal shower and I was complementing my little cousins dress and she told me that I didn’t look nice. Now, I’m obviously not going to hold a grudge against the kid, but this is in front of my whole family. That bride went on to say “Well, at least she’s being honest”. Those little back handed things  bothered me a little but I just wanted to avoid drama and get the whole thing over with. She included me as one of the bridesmaids, which I thought was very nice of her. She has a bunch of sisters so they added me into a groupchat on whatsapp and I went over their house and I helped them plan her bridal shower. I also participated as like one of the bridesmaids in her bridal shower and we played games and it was really nice. I had a lot of fun but then all of a sudden after was in November, I never received any messages and calls any text. Nothing. I knew zero about what was going on and now the wedding was almost a month away (May) and I literally had zero information on what the bridesmaids were gonna be doing. I scheduled my make up appointment at 1:30 because the girl that I do make up with only takes appointments really far in advance and you have to pay a deposit.

We never have spoke about our past relationships because every time I bring it up he shuts down and gets cold. Prior to us getting together I obviously knew that my boyfriend would have a few exes. I recently found out that not only is he still talking to his long term ex (F21) but they are also “best friends”. The only reason why I found out was because he had to postpone by birthday plans because he had to pay for some emergency that his ex had with her dog. She called his phone at least over 7 times in the middle of the night. We got into a huge fight all because I asked if he could kindly stop communicating with her after this emergency.

He told me that was too much to ask from him since they were together for 7 years. Apparently their relationship runs so deep that he considers her more than a lover/friend. I asked how he expects me; or anyone for that fact to be okay with that. They have no kids they were never married so I don’t understand what is keeping her connected to her. They lived together for 3 years and used to do a bunch of psychedelics together so he thinks that they’re souls are bonded no matter what. Which is INSANE..right.? I’m his girlfriend yet I feel like the other girl.


I love him a bunch but I don’t know what to do. When we fought about it he made me feel really bad and as if I was lucky for even landing him after his past relationship.

We got back in contact at the end of freshman year in highschool. We’ve talked everyday since.

During the time we weren’t talking and were out of contact, I made another best friend who died summer going into 6th grade. That death hit me hard, and because of it I was extremely sensitive and took to harmful coping mechanisms including starving myself. I felt fat all the time, I was constantly very underweight and almost died 4 times because of it. As soon as it felt right I explained everything to Delilah and how sensitive I still am to talking about calories and weight. She understood and has respected that, which I’m grateful for. 

In Delilah’s household, it’s common to talk about weight loss, something her dad drilled into her family. He shames my best friend in her weight and forces her to take sketchy dieting pills. She told me she doesn’t like it, and she’s happy where she is, but she doesn’t want to disappoint her dad. I understood, despite being unhappy with it and seeing my best friends mental health decreasing as the days go by. 

Delilah has been sleeping over my house a lot recently, I’ve been trying to make sure she eats enough and enjoys sugary snacks as well as any kind of junk she’s willing to eat because of how strict her dad is. we have a lot of fun, today she went home after spending a couple nights and while I was helping her bring her stuff in her mom compliments me on how skinny I’ve gotten and how I’ve “lost weight” (I’m 215 pounds, last time we spoke I was 190 pounds) the discomfort hit me hard and I felt my stomach at discreetly as possible and I couldn’t feel my ribs (I used to be able to feel each rib individually) and dissociated until I just got home.

We have been in a committed relationship for 1 year. We get along great and have a great relationship.

We do not live together, so she is moving from her old 1 bedroom apartment to her new 2 bedroom apartment. 

The new apartment is vacant and ready to move into now. Her new apartment’s lease does not start for another month, so she has a long time to make the move.

Given that she has a long time to make the move, my girlfriend wants to make 3 different trips over 3 different Sundays to move in.

I told her I’d be more than happy to help her move in, but I can’t spend multiple days doing this. I told her to tell me which day she needs me to help her move in, and I will do whatever she needs me to do for as long as it takes… But that I can only help her for one day. 

My girlfriend is very upset that I would not help her move in over multiple days. For what it’s worth, she also has her mom and dad driving an hour and a half from where they live on separate days to help her move too.

She continued to yell & I kicked her out of the house. She's really mad. Madison is on my side, but I am wondering whether I overreacted.

Our dad remarried after the divorce 9 years ago. His wife has a daughter 10f who lives with them full time now but her dad was around for a little while when they first got together and he left after my dad's wife won custody officially. He doesn't pay anything for his kid and my dad and his wife are the ones covering everything for her.

My dad and his wife haven't been doing so good with money for a couple of years and this year has been the worst yet for them. My mom is doing better than ever though and she's really been stable with money. So my brother and I have a much better life than our stepsister. We get to do extra curricular's and we get nicer stuff in general. This got so much more obvious lately because my brother got to do two field trips and I got to do an international trip with my school last year.

My stepsister had a field trip come up a couple of weeks ago but my dad and his wife couldn't afford to pay for it. They asked my mom to pay and she said no. They asked my brother to ask my mom and he didn't. So dad asked me to ask mom. He told me how much his stepdaughter wanted to go but the school didn't have a fund to cover for families who couldn't afford it. He told me he knows it's not mom's job but they were desperate and just wanted her to have a nice time and she knows my brother and I never miss out and he didn't want her to feel less important.

I didn't ask. My dad got super pissed when the field trip came and neither my brother or I asked mom. And my stepsister didn't get to go which super pissed him off.

My husband loves to travel, and he still talks about our honeymoon to Europe on a regular basis. This was eight years ago, long before we had our child, and I admit that was a fabulous trip. But ever since we got pregnant, my husband daydreamed about taking our child along to Europe, showing them sights, etc. He never got that experience as a child and wanted our son to have that. I did travel as a young child, but it was definitely a lot for my parents to deal with and in hindsight, it would've just been easier to wait till we were older.

With the summer coming up, my husband is insisting on planning a trip to Europe for the three of us. He would've pushed for it sooner but COVID was a factor for the first couple years, and then after that it still didn't feel like the right time. We've taken small road trips with our son before, a few hours driving distance mostly to see family members.

I brought this up with my husband and he's begging me to reconsider, he misses traveling so much and hates that we never go anywhere.

My mom thinks she is the most innocent creature in the world, and my dad is a narcissist who I don't talk to much. They got separated, and my dad got custody of my sister and me. He didn't want to raise us, but my uncle and grandpa made him take us home. He didn't really raise us; my uncle and aunt did. My grandpa, sister, uncle, and I all live in the same house, which is common in Southeast Asia.

Let's talk about my mom, Susan. She cheated on my dad, Jake, with her friend. When Jake found out, he begged Susan not to leave him. He even threatened to harm himself and made us beg her to stay too. We didn’t say anything, so he threatened to kick us out of school and make us work as waiters. He said mean things about us, claiming we weren’t his kids, and he cried and screamed at all of us (my grandpa, uncle, aunt, sister, and me). My uncle sent him to therapy every week, but I think he was faking it. He cried without shedding a single tear, more like a child begging for candy.

This all started during summer break and continued when school resumed. I couldn’t focus on my studies and failed my exams. I was usually smart, so my teacher asked if something had happened. I lied and said everything was okay.

After the divorce, Susan took us to stay temporarily with her sister and nephew. Her sister accused us of being happy that our parents' marriage broke up, asking if we thought we could live happily while Susan suffered. Surprisingly, I didn't care because I didn't love them; they weren't good parents. They were abusive, but I didn't say anything and just listened to her lecture.

Susan acted like the victim, pretending to be a sweet, innocent girl. Her sister lectured us about how our parents' divorce would lead to us living on the streets and begging for money.

We went to court, and Jake won custody. He said we couldn't meet Susan anymore, and I didn't care. After a month or two of not seeing us, Susan connected with us on social media, saying she missed us and was lonely. We felt sad and visited her every month. She seemed nice, and we thought she had changed. But when we got busy and didn't visit for a month, she told her relatives we weren’t talking to her. We sometimes video call her when no one is home and sneak out once a month to see her.

Today, my uncle from Susan's side messaged my sister, saying we should talk to our mom. I don’t know how many relatives she has told that we aren’t talking to her. Now, I think I should block her on social media and never go to her and her boyfriend’s home again.

The first 6 years, I was working towards my BA and MA, and working full-time to support my parents.

At that same time, my partner was working two full-time jobs and supporting a close friend through their mental health crisis.

Then I moved out with what pitiful amount of savings I had to finally be with my partner. We are so in love, and I am grateful for every day. We were long distance before moving in together, and saw each other monthly or every other month the whole time. So living together is a dream come true.

93,1cvskor,WIBTA If I Change my MOH from One Sister to the Other,"WIBTA if I Changed My Maid Of Honor From One Sister to the Other?

I (F24) am going to be getting married in a couple months. When I first got engaged about a year ago, I asked my sister (currently 22 who I will refer to as MoH) to be my maid of honor and she accepted. My other sister (Currently 16 but at the time 15 who I will refer to as S) and I were not very close at the time. 

MoH has not been around during much of the wedding process while S has, which makes sense as MoH has a full time job while S does not and is homeschooled. 

MoH has not really had any input into the wedding process. While we do live under the same roof, I hardly see her anymore as she's always working or out with friends, which is great for her, but when she is home she almost never wants to see or talk to me and says she is tired quite often. I feel like she is a stranger at this point. When we do talk, it's usually not about anything personal. It's more small talk. A lot of the time it feels like family is an irritation to her and she tolerates my more than everyone else except S, who she has a decent relationship with. 

Meanwhile, S and I have bonded a lot over the past year. We have become very close and share personal things with each other. She has also been a large help with the planning. 

I often justified MoH's absence with her work. I know she's busy and gets tired easily. I did ask her a couple months ago if she wanted to step down and just be a bridesmaid. She said that she really did want to be my maid of honor. I'm not even sure if she has started thinking about what her speech would be like and I know she has not planned a Bachelorette party at all.

The biggest thing that has me second guessing is that yesterday was my bridal shower. It was a tea party with a lot of food. My mom was hosting and she, S, and I were all working hard for the past three days to finish getting everything together. We all stayed up late and got up early for the most part on those days in comparison to when we would normally go to bed and get up.

MoH was initially going to help out and make a desert, but she decided she was too tired. She did have a big concert she was going to the night of my bridal shower. (I didn't know about until after I had planned when the bridal shower was. She wasn't really around to ask) I knew she was getting ready for that as well, but I had hoped she would at least help out with some prep work. The night before, an excuse she gave was that she wanted to clean her room so that she could be ready on time (Her room is never especially messy. There were some clothes and such on the floor, but it doesn't take more than 30 min to clean if that) and then she was tired. The morning of, I guess she was gluing her fake nails on and getting her outfit together.

She wasn't really around to ask) I knew she was getting ready for that as well, but I had hoped she would at least help out with some prep work. The night before, an excuse she gave was that she wanted to clean her room so that she could be ready on time (Her room is never especially messy. There were some clothes and such on the floor, but it doesn't take more than 30 min to clean if that) and then she was tired. The morning of, I guess she was gluing her fake nails on and getting her outfit together.

94,1cvsj78,AITA for losing my temper after my friend did not try understanding my situation?,"I(21F) have been friends with, let's call him Tom, (22 M) for more than 5 years. We went to the same high school and have kept in touch ever since. We have not met each other after we graduated school, since we went to study at different places and lives quit far from each other. But we always try to call each other and check in atleast once or twice every month. 

After school, I didn't go to college directly and took a gap year whereas he went for a degree. When I became 20, my family told me that I have to pay for my own expenses, which is actually quite rare where I am from. Usually parents take care of all the expenses and finances till the children get a job at least. It is very rare for boys, more so for girls, to go for a part time job when they are 20. But this is just how my family is. My elder brother was also told this and I was no exception. So I looked for a job and got a job quite far from home. I am also completing my graduation at the same time.
For Tom, he has completed his degree and is planning to go abroad, fully financed by his family of course. 

My exams are coming up and I have been very busy lately, but I still make time to call him. But each time, he is like ""why are you doing this, can't you just complete your degree first? You are only 21. You should focus on studies and quit the job"".
I have tried explaining to him multiple times that it just doesn't work that way. But each time we call and I say I am busy with my job he just doesn't understand. I was very tired yesterday and lost my temper with him as he said it again and I might have taken things too far. I told him that I don't get things handed to me on a plate like him and I have to work for it. This is where I might have screwed up. I hung up the phone and have not even tried apologising. Honestly, I don't feel like it. He has not texted me back either. I can see that he is coming from a good place. Am I an asshole for losing my temper and saying those words?

95,1cvshot,WIBTA for wanting to ban my cousin from my mother's funeral?,"This is a rough one for me to ask, but here goes. I (53f) have a cousin (54f) we'll call ""Melanie"" who was like a sister to me growing up. We lived next door to each other in a very rural area. We did everything together and my parents were somewhat parents by proxy to her as her mother worked long hours as a nurse and she was left on her own a lot.

Time goes by, we grow up, go our separate paths,I was around 19 or & made an incredibly dumb decision involving her, being extremely naive. My parents were great, but they did tend to shelter me a lot as a kid, thinking ""if we can keep her away from all things bad, then nothing will ever hurt her."" So I knew what I did was not good, I just didn't understand HOW ""not good"" it was.

Melanie made it a point after that to ignore me at any family gathering or whenever our paths crossed. Would not speak to me, just would not acknowledge that I was in the same room. Fast forward a few years. Our grandmother passed away, and Melanie decided that life was too short and it was time to let bygones be bygones. We made up and for a long time, everything was just fine again.

One evening, we were chatting on Skype just getting caught up, and she mentioned some issues with one of our cousins. I told her only what I'd been told, nothing bad and then we moved on and finished our conversation. The next morning, I found myself blocked on Skype and every social media platform that we had been friended on. I reached out to her husband, and asked what was going on, no response. We've had quite a few deaths in the family since, & at each funeral she once again makes it a point to look the other way and walk right past me. I have even said ""Hey can we talk?"" and she pretends she doesn't hear me.

So, my mother is almost 75 y/o and not in the best of health. I mean realistically she could live to be 80 or even 90, the women in her family typically do live longer, but still. I have told my children as well as my brother that I don't want Melanie at mom's funeral when the time comes. That is going to be a deeply emotional time for me. My dad passed years ago and to lose my only remaining parent is already going to be something I truly struggle with. Having Melanie there, more or less ""showing her butt"" as my Granny would've said, will just add more fuel to the fire. My brother & my youngest son said I'm taking it a bit too far & that Melanie should have the right to pay condolences & grieve just like anyone else. I argue that she can grieve anywhere else but at the funeral, and she can pay condolences at a time where myself and my children are not there. I know this sounds incredbily petty, but it's not.

For some insight I have quite bad anxiety and do not leave the house really unless necessary. 

He was knocking quite loud and and looked out the window and it was him and since this was only of the only times I have ever really had him knock the door I assumed I was urgent and answered. He asked me on the date tonight and I said no and he ask for tomorrow and I said no then he went onto say let me know and I didn’t know what to say. 

Ten minutes later he came back to the door but I couldn’t get myself to answer so I stuck my head out the window. He started shouting how it was on him how he would pay for everything and not to worry and how he will come see me again. 
I’ll be completely honest I didn’t know how to respond so I just said thanks. 

He knows my mum better than he knows me so it kind of creeps me out the fact he asked me out when he has known me since I was a 14. My home is a safe space for me so the fact he came to my home and asked me out at my front door just has thrown me off I don’t know how to turn him down and feel comfortable.

Thanks to everyone who has gave suggestions and helped me so far. I haven’t seen him this morning and his car is gone so I assume he’s gone to work. 
I was able to talk to my mum and she was annoyed to say the least. We have came up with a plan for the time being;
I won’t be answering the door from now on unless I am notified that someone is coming. We are going to order a ring door bell so that I can check who is at the door. 
When my mum sees him she plans on confronting him and telling him I am not interested and that he is being highly inappropriate. 
I am still on edge especially since he said he will come back but I feel a little better now and I’m hoping the only other update will be him leaving me alone but thanks again. I’ll update again after my mum confronts him. Thanks again 🙂

97,1cvs7g7,AITA for calling my nephew in the afternoon (as opposed to first thing in the morning) for his 2nd birthday?,"My brother (35) lives in Spain with his wife and two boys (4) and (2). I live in Ireland and there is only 1hour time difference. My youngest nephew turns two today and I have it on my to-do list (and calendar reminder each year) to call him to wish him a happy birthday etc. 

This morning, I woke up at 9:30am and hopped into the shower. Then I ironed a shirt and trousers to be at a church mass (Holy Communion - Catholic thing) for 11am. No breakfast, straight out the door. Then after the church, I went to my relations for some food, and as soon as I got in through the door, I asked for their WiFi so I could sit down and do a video call with the birthday boy. I then noticed a text from my brother at 12noon asking if I could 'if I could please call him as it's nephews birthday.'

I sit down, and video call at 1pm, and sing happy birthday and we have the chats. And at the very end of the call he asked if he could ask a favour and put his sons birthdays in my calendar. I said I already have them in the calendar, and I had always planned to call today. And he made the point that I'm calling at 1pm, instead of ""making it a priority"" and calling first thing in the morning. I said it's a birth*day*, and said when we were growing up our aunties and uncles wouldn't call us in the morning. He made the point that otherwise his boys are left wondering if I will call all morning or not on their birthdas. For context, I have never missed a single birthday and I have a good relationship with my brother. I said I will try to call in the morning going forward, but this isn't normal and stop acting like it is. 

AITA for arguing with him? Or does he have a point? Part of me wishes to call next birthday at 4:30am..

98,1cvs73l,AITA for staying away from my baby?,"I (30F) have a 2.5 month old. Initially I tried breastfeeding but it was excruciatingly painful by day 3. My milk supply hadn't kicked in so my husband (40M) and I had decided on formula feeding. I had tried daily to breastfeed after a week had passed, but my supply was low and her feeding was more to stimulate production. She was still on formula. I decided to try pumping as a way to stimulate supply (she was crying and spitting my boob out because her mouth was too small to latch properly).

Pumping requires time. Whenever she goes down, I'd be doing chores. I never napped while she napped because there was always something to do. I could never get quality pumping time in, because she'd always be up before then. In her first month, my husband would be up with her at nights from 11-3, and I would be with her the rest of the time. After her first month, I would do all nights and days. He leaves for work at 8am and returns between 7:30pm-8:30pm. He will tend to her from 8:30pm/9:00pm until she falls asleep so I can do the rest of the housework. I'm now back at work full time, I still do nights, and do all the housework. I am with her from the time I come home from work, until he comes home from work. Trying to pump has taken a significant backseat. She's on formula, she's growing, she's happy and she's healthy. 

Last night, my husband asked if I had picked up the pills my Dr prescribed two weeks ago to help with my milk supply. I said I hadn't had time as I rush home to our daughter after work. He began to go off at me, saying that I'm pathetic because I couldn't even get the pills or ask him to get it as it involves what's best for his daughter. I told him to stop talking, yet he continued his rant, telling me he has every right to talk about my breastmilk and demanding I do it because it's for his daughter. He then blew off at me telling me I'm making excuses, he shouted f- you multiple times to me, screamed me that I'm not allowed to feed her at all, that he'll feed her, that he'll do everything for her, that I'm pathetic because I can't even look after her properly, that I should just f- off. So I left our bedroom and slept in the spare room. I have texted him telling him that what he said was humiliating and hurtful.

99,1cvs6e3,AITA for asking my roommate to hang at their partner's place more frequently?,"Last night my roommate and I got into a pretty nasty argument over me asking them to spend more time at their partner's place.

For context: My roommate has been dating their partner for four months and the relationship has moved incredibly fast. Their partner spends time at our home with my roommate 3-4 times a week. My roommate and I are good friends and share many mutual friends, and now their partner is involved in almost all social plans among our friends. I think it's great that my roommate is acclimating their partner so well with our friends, but I feel as though I am almost third-wheeling this relationship with the frequency that I see my roommate's partner. 

So yesterday had been the third day in a row that I had seen or hung out with my roommate's partner. They come here often to nap or do other couple activities midday, including my roommate's partner coming over to cowork 2-3 times a week since they both work remotely. My roommate and I came to an agreement they would use something to make it so I am unable to hear them while their partner is over doing partner activities. When they are not doing that, they are often talking loudly with the bedroom door open. I put on headphones to respect their privacy, but I feel as though the expected privacy I should also have is not there because they do not make attempts to be private.

I began to feel overwhelmed because it feels as though I cannot escape the couple-y-ness no matter how I try to navigate this. After my roommate had walked their partner out, I asked if we could talk about something and posed my question of them hanging with their partner a little more at their partner's place. I know they often come here because the partner's roommate is super religious and they have an agreement on having their partner's spend the night, but I don't see why they can't spend their afternoons or evenings there once a week instead of always coming here. I explained that they have their partner over 3-4 times a week on top of having their partner now at almost every social event within the friendgroup, and I feel as though I'm almost constantly thirdwheeling.

My roommate either misunderstood me or decided to misconstrue my words because they began saying that it's normal for them to have their partner over to hang for 6 hours. They said that their partner is friends with everyone and no one else has had a complaint but me. I tried to explain that none of our other friends live with them so they don't have this same experience, but my roommate didn't want to hear it and took my question as a personal attack on their relationship.

Before that message they have been texting ALOT too sending him what nails she wanna do and allat, even though she told me what ever she told him, it was still really bothering me. She even asked him to send his time table although they are in different schools. When I saw that message, I was really heartbroken, she realised her mistake and did what every person caught doing something bad would act. I forgave her, but things were so different, I started shouting more and Ive just become so paranoid about everything, everytime I told her im feeling paranoid about what she's doing and if she could update me, she always gets annoyed, and it always leads to big arguments. To cut to the chase, today I had my biggest argument with her and I think we're done. I was overthinking again and once again and we were already on kind of bad terms, I starting saying things like why don't you go date your friend instead? Why don't you just leave me for him instead?

103,1cvrzk2,AITA for not supporting my gym fight team? ,"I am a female. I have been practicing Muay Thai since 2009, have trained Muay Thai in Thailand, immersed myself in Muay Thai and Thai culture by watching fights both in Rajadamnern and Lumpini multiple times. I am now almost in my 40's and have a good paying job in a hospital where I need my brain to do a lot of thinking. I do not fight in Muay Thai anymore but I still practice it for overall sanity and fitness. 

I found a new gym which I think offers great instructions in Muay Thai. I love my coaches. The gym vibe, not so much. Since I am new to the gym, I introduce myself to every single training partners I have, may they be female, male, novice, advanced, etc. I clean the Thai pads and kick shields after I use them. I put stuff away and return them to where I took them from. Even non-Muay Thai practitioners who come to the gym, I have come to know and greet them every time I see them in the gym. The front desk ladies, the maintenance guys and janitors, and even the main boss man owner I say hello to every time I arrive at the gym. I train regularly, about 5 to 6 days of the week. 

Since I train regularly, coach has noticed that I have good technique. He asked me if I wanted to train to fight. I respectfully thanked him and said no because my priorities have already changed. 

I have met the fight team. I have introduced myself to them, and themselves to me. After that first encounter, however, when I see them at the gym and say hi, they could not be bothered to hold eye contact, nod, wave hi, do a fist bump, or anything like that to recognize my existence. However, come fight week, they all become friendly to the entire Muay Thai class, introducing themselves individually, and advertising how they have a fight coming up and would like our support by buying their tickets to the fight show. 

I think it is weird. I don't buy their tickets because 1) I have seen real authentic Muay Thai fights LIVE in Rajadamnern and Lumpini so I am not very invested in seeing an amateur fight, 2) my classmates think that going to the fights of the fight team is showing support to the gym but I feel like I have already done that by paying three years worth of gym fee upfront, cleaning my gym, being a respectful gym goer by being polite to other gym goes, cleaning and putting stuff away, etc., and 3) if I were to go to an amateur fight, I would gladly give them money TO SUPPORT THE FIGHTER.

I (36F) have been with my husband (41M) for almost 8 years - married for 4 & a half years. His family have never liked me. They never knew me at all or ever spoke to me or included our son (5) in their lives. It was made abundantly clear that they didn’t approve of me but I never knew why. Until a couple of months ago I had only met MIL (she’s nice) and I had never met his dad before he died earlier this year. FIL refused to ever meet me and would not accept our son as his grandchild. That changed last summer. All of a sudden he wanted to meet us. I allowed our son to meet him but I didn’t want to. Too much water under the bridge for me. Our son and FIL had a short lived relationship but a close one. He got to know FIL over 8 months before he died. I had gotten to meet my husband’s family at FILs funeral. Husband and I organised all of FILs affairs and had to get a loan from my mum to pay for the funeral. None of his family offered any help or thanks. They were standoffish with me. After talking to one of his nicer relatives I discovered why FIL and the family hated me so much. Husband’s ex. She had told some lies to FIL about me and he believed them. It was enough to make him despise me and by extension my son. She told him that I had “stolen” husband away from her and their daughter, that he was an adulterer. It’s simply not true. Sometimes I wish it was just so all the nonsense that I’ve endured would have been worth it. Ex also told FIL that husband wasn’t paying any child maintenance/support so FIL gave her money regularly. My husband pays almost £230 per month in support btw. Always has done. FIL found this out last summer. He cut her off and that prompted him to want to have a relationship with me & our son. As a direct consequence of her lies my son missed out on years with his grandfather. I hate her for it. But I discovered that SHE is in fact a cheater. She has been with her BF for 5 years now. However. The first 4 years of their relationship she was his side piece. He was engaged to another woman which he lived with. Ex knew. She knew he was in a relationship but carried on seeing him. Inevitably his fiancée found out about ex and the other women he was cheating with and broke up with him. They have been in a legit relationship now for just over a year.

The first couple times I snapped back and it started arguments between my wife and I. But after it went on and after it kept happening I stopped talking or saying anything to her to avoid the arguments between the wife and I, so at this point I have to walk on egg shells in my own house. 4 months go by and MIL is broke, no car no license, hasn’t paid any bills, bought groceries twice (I have no clue where her money went) And stopped doing the chores that were agreed to be done til she got a job. 6 months and she begged her family members and friends for money to get a car (which they gave her) and she hit 2 things during her test drive for a car from Facebook market place so she bought the car so she didn’t have to pay for damages (I suggested not even taking the car for a drive as it was a pos that I could tell already had problems) car ends up having a bad engine so car is useless. 9 months and I’m still walking on eggshells in my own house, no bills are being paid by mil, no job, no groceries being bought by broke mil.

113,1cvqmeo,AITA for refusing to help my girlfriend paint her house because she wants to keep all the labor costs that her landlord is paying for?,"My girlfriend just rented this apartment in a city we don’t currently live in and her landlord is paying her and her roommate $1000 to paint the inside of it (supplies included). Originally we weren’t sure if her roommate was gonna do it so i immediately offered to help and split the money with my girlfriend, which she agreed to. Turned out her roommate did want to help, so i figured i wasn’t needed and didn’t think anything more of it. 

Yesterday, me and my girlfriend headed to the city where we share a cheap apartment we call our studio. She dropped me off to do my thing then she went to her apartment to meet up with her roommate and her roommates mom. This is where the issue begins. 

That evening, she texts me asking why I’m not helping her. At this time I’m busy making music at the studio so i just tell her that. When she gets back to the studio a couple hours later, shes telling me all about her day and everything and mentions how i ought to help her tomorrow. I don’t say anything then but I’m thinking, ain’t no way unless you pay me or something. I would of course help if there was no money on the table but in this situation, i think that asking me for free help when shes getting paid for labor is unfair. I didn’t say anything that night though, i just went to bed. 

The next morning she asks if ill come help and i pretty much just said no. This made her pretty mad and she was saying that i really should help since I’m her boyfriend. She also said her roommates mom is helping and shes not getting paid. I still didn’t think it’s right and i told her i wouldn’t ask for half of her $500 but i think i should be paid some for the labor if theres money allocated to that. I then realized i don’t even have clothes to paint in. The argument went in circles just like that for a minute or two and then she stormed out to go back to her apartment.

So then i text her because i don’t think she understands my perspective of the situation. I said that she should have told me to bring some paint clothes if she wanted me to help. Also, i said that its pretty entitled to expect help for free when you’re getting paid so much for labor. She said that money is for her rent. Well, that money could be for my rent too! I said, “he’s paying you for LABOR and you’re asking me to do the labor, but you’re keeping all the money.” She said “its just called helping a friend.”

Again, i would absolutely help her if there wasn’t money for labor involved. But since there is, i think its pretty messed up that she wouldn’t even consider paying me for the labor shes asking me to do. It just feels really unfair and its not what i would do in her place.

With this newfound financial freedom, we decided to purchase a home in my wife’s small hometown on a lake. This decision was made with the intention of investing in a property that would appreciate in value and also serve to strengthen our children's connection to her family, including her grandparents, her parents, her sister, and her sister’s children.

The weekdays at the lake house are serene and enjoyable, with quiet moments and pleasant weather. However, the weekends bring about a different atmosphere.

Early in the morning, my wife’s parents arrive with my wife’s sisters children, without the children's parents, expecting breakfast and adding to the chaos. The most challenging aspect, though, is my wife’s sister frequently leaving her children in our care without prior notice. This routine has become increasingly burdensome as these children, who seem to be primarily raised by their grandparents (while the parents are fully capable of watching their own children), exhibit challenging behavior. They are often disruptive, destructive, and seem to require constant attention, leading me to believe there may be underlying issues such as ADHD.

While my wife and I work hard during the week, I yearn for weekends to be a time of relaxation and family bonding. Instead, I find myself tending to someone else’s children, which only fosters resentment.

Part of me suspects that my wife’s sister’s actions stem from jealousy, as she lacks a lakeside home herself. I wish to involve my wife’s parents more in our family activities, allowing them to bond with our children, but the constant childcare responsibilities prevent this from happening.

The real challenge lies in my wife’s reluctance to confront her family about this issue. Previous attempts to address it resulted in prolonged conflicts, discouraging further discussion. Her family dynamics, characterized by emotional volatility and an inability to communicate effectively, only exacerbate the situation.

However, compared to my own family, who respect boundaries and communicate openly, my wife's family tends to overstep boundaries. This disparity fuels my suspicion that envy may be driving their behavior.

Despite our dissatisfaction being known, we have yet to find a lasting solution. I am torn between wanting to preserve our family's relationship with my wife’s family, especially considering their fragile ages and health, and my desire to enjoy weekends in peace.

While selling the lake house seems like an easy way out, I also want to provide my children with the opportunity to create lasting memories there.

The person on the other end asked me where I was at. She didn’t put me on mute when she got on the walkie to get a supervisor and I heard her call me a difficult customer.  So AITA?",0.0,1.0441648960113525,1,0
120,1cvpipo,AITA for bailing on my friend?,"2 weeks prior, I was invited to come to an event that my friend organized in her town - a sports day (2 hours away). At that time I asked her, what is to be expected for the day? Her answer - it's a sports day What sports are we playing ? Anything you want. How many people are going? About 65. I said I'll go. It seemed to me by her vague answers that we were going to a park and playing sports with her community members. I couldn't get many details out of her, she was not forthcoming with information and any questions I asked I got vague answers. I let it go.  
  
A week before the event, I had a terrible week, about 1-2 hours of sleep each night prior to the day (I work 2 jobs, many hours) a hectic week. I thought, out of 65 people will they really miss one person? I didn't think I could stay awake long enough to drive 2 hours, or be a part of a sports day all day. So I sent a message and I apologized for my last minute cancellation and I explained why. She was upset and then informed me that t-shirts had been made , a host had been hired, one person missing from a team would cause a huge problem. So, I said, I probably can't wake up at 8am to drive, but I could come later in the afternoon if that was ok - no answer. Before finishing work and going to bed at 5am there was still no answer. I did legit think for a second of just staying awake until 8am because if I fell asleep then, I doubt I'd wake up to my alarm, but I finally texted and said I think I shouldn't come since it now seems she is upset with me and I haven't heard back. I cannot stress how exhausted I felt, I was running on fumes, I fully admitted that I sucked for canceling and I was sorry. I had no idea there had been more planning of the event, if I had known, I would have said NO right off the bat to not include me. I expressed this to her as well. I fully understand I ATA here for canceling late, but I was canceling, I think for legit reasons but of course you be the judge! And I was unaware of the extent of the event details. Regardless, I've learned that my job does not allow me to say yes to events and for now I should just say no until I have more of a work/life balance. I really wanted to be there for her event but, I just could not do it this time. This was my first time canceling on her.  
  
Also, we had a mutal friend that I had a falling out with who lives in that town, and she said she disinvited him from the event for me so that I could go. I hadn't asked her to do this and the friend and I had said our peace and I was not against seeing him again and being cordial. SHE KNOWS THIS. So she was also upset that he was not going.

Since January my mom had started to order more stuff online, buy me things i didn’t ask for and other small things (i have a suspicion that a part of this money has gone to alcohol, because my mom has a drinking problem but my dad doesn’t drink at all). 

Getting warmer where I live my moms work has gotten a lot more physically challenging. She often comes home after long shifts and complains about how much everything hurts and about how she doesn’t get paid enough for what she does. (When the pain from work is so bad that medicine doesn’t help she uses alcohol to cope). 

In the past few weeks the complaints now include how there isn’t going to be enough money to go on the trip. I have asked her how much is there really left but she keeps dogging the question. Which brings us to this week. My dad’s car broke down so he asked my mom to give him 700€ to fix it (he would give it back after his pay day) 
My mom gave him the money and thats that. 

Today my dad needed another 100€ for the car, but mom was at work so he asked me to take some out of the stash. (This way I found out that me and my mom are the only people who know where this money is) While taking the 100€ out i decided to quickly count how much was left. 

To say the least i was shocked from the 2500€ we decided to save for the trip thats in two months by the way, only 500€ were left. Adding the 800€ my dad took thats 1300€. 

I didn’t tell anything to dad, he would explode. I went out for a walk and called my mom, all I said is that I counted the money, that I was disappointed and that we would need to have a talk 1 on 1 about how i think she has a problem and about how to get 1200€ back in two months. She was angry, she said that I had no business counting the money, that i have violated our trust and that we will be speaking only when dad leaves for work in a week then she just said she can’t talk and hung up

122,1cvox85,AITA for setting boundaries with parents?,"Hubby and I bought a home and my parents contributed a part of the down payment. We paid for most of the down payment and we pay for the mortgage.

My mom recently asked for a key to our home so she can come and help out with the baby. However, she always shows up to our home unannounced and just comes in. Many times, I’m startled that someone is in the home or there are sounds from the kitchen because I didn’t know she came. 

She doesn’t live in the same state as us, and when she visits she doesn’t stay with us. Whenever she goes back to her home state, I always asks for my key back, but she always “forgets” and never gave it back. I had the feeling that she didn’t have the intention on ever returning the key.

Anyway, she visited us again and I made sure to ask for my key again on the last day. She kept saying how would she come over to help without the key? And I said I can always let her in. I explained to her that I want some privacy and want to set some boundaries because I’m always startled when she comes in without letting me know too. My dad overheard it and he kept telling my mom to just keep the key and not return it. I insisted that I wanted the key back because I want privacy and I feel that she doesn’t respect my boundaries when she just shows up. My mom finally gave the key back unwillingly but she said to my dad “you bought them a home and they wouldn’t even give us a key.” 

That comment got me upset because they didn’t even buy us the home but they felt that their contribution entitled them to access my home whenever they wanted. I couldn’t control my emotions and said many parents buy a home for their child but don’t ask for the key to show up unannounced whenever they feel like it. And I kept trying to explain to them that it’s crossing boundaries to keep coming over unannounced whenever they want without respecting our privacy. Moreover, this is our marital home. Is it too much to ask for privacy in our own home? I feel that my parents do now understand the concept of boundaries and privacy even though I tried explaining many times.

My boyfriend is a real estate developer/property manager, last year December I was having house issues with where I was living as at the time, I used to work at a Tech company but I recently switched careers to become a Corporate Flight Attendant, the job has been really slow, so I needed to move ASAP. 
My boyfriend decided to move me into one of his rental properties, and told me that this was only temporary because The “said” Appartment was outdated and needed a lot of work, I ended up fixing the place up to make it livable for me.
We also had plans that he was going to employ me as one of his apartment manager to a nicer house so i can move in there when the time comes.
Also, while I was going through my house issues, my bestfriend (30) happens to be  going through the same issues and also  needed a place to stay for the meantime.
So I told her to move in with me since it was a two bedroom. When my boyfriend found out that my friend moved into the apartment that he got for me, He became angry and was always complaining about my friend being in the house and we don’t get to have time for each other anymore. 
Mind you, before then I had already introduced my bestfriend to my boyfriend, because my bestfriend wanted to open a restaurant, and my boyfriend was also looking to invest into a restaurant business, so I had introduce them in the past out of the kindness of my heart. so fast forward to now, my boyfriend and I have an Unreconcilable differences and as a result of that he’s asking me to move out of the apartment that he got for me. 
 I said to him that I don’t have anywhere to go. He knows my current situation. My work is going really slow that he has to give me time to figure out where to move to, I also asked him about the plans of him making me a property manager. He told me the plan’s changed, the next thing I know he’s taking me to court to evict me, and as we speak, the case is still in court waiting for trial.
While all this was going on, my best friend was still living with me. She saw how my boyfriend was being hostile towards me, and as a result of that she had to move out of my apartment. 
Fast forward to today. I woke up to a text message from my bestfriend, she sent me a screenshot of the message My boyfriend sent to her, telling her that if she’s interested in becoming a house manager to one of his properties that she should let him know because he was supposed to give me the job as we planned but since we’re having issues, he wants to extend the kind gesture to her.
I know he’s doing all this to spite me and to create enmity between me and my bestfriend.

I got a short term but stressful job and agreed to cover all the bills for the two of us whilst he took some time off to rest and study and the we agreed that when I needed time off he would do the same. I paid for all the bills for 9 months and although things have been difficult for us we agreed I would quit my job in April and he would start working and covering the bills. I said I was worried financially and couldn't afford my bills if he didn't support me and he promised he would.

At the beginning of May he broke up with me. We still love each other and want to be there for each other but he wants no contact for a while. He is doing a temporary training placement abroad and asked me to pack up his things and move him out for him. I asked him to back pay his half of the bills for the past 9 months (he can afford this from savings) but he got very angry and confused why I would ask him for this. He said as we've broken up now we don't have any financial responsibility for each other and he shouldn't have to help me out as we're not together.

I feel really hurt but also now really worried financially. I'm trying to understand things from his perspective but I'm really struggling.

I dont think its that big of a Problem to me but since most of the time i have to ask for Permission from my Parents to have 6 people at Our home because duh, my parents wanna relax on the weekend too and on this Day my parents had to go to sleep earlier because they had to wake up real early the next day PLUS on this Day i went to a Concert for which i didnt know when i would be home from (which turned out to be around 11:30 pm) i couldnt really make ""plans"" with my friends.

Okay so, around a week before that, a friend of mine sent a message to Our groupchat about hanging out together, but what i found kinda weird and arrogant was that He said that we could hang at MY house! A bit later He said only with permission of course but still. I'm a bit annoyed by that but not too much at that point.

The next Day we went to Hangout at a Fast Food Place to maybe discuss some Hangout plans.
There i told them that i dont know when i would be home on that Day and since i would have NO clue what time that would be i said that MAYBE we could hang out if i was home early. End of Discussion on that Day.

A few days before the Concert and Maybe Hangout Day, my friends wrote in Our groupchat asking about the Hangout plans and since i still had no clue when i would be home that Day, because how would i know? I couldnt tell them when we could hangout. Here comes my mistake: i told them that maybe we could hangout if i was home early enough, but i of course didnt know when that would be.

So then they wanted a clear answer but since i kinda wanted to hangout but didnt know when i told them again, maybe we can hangout but i dont know when.

I'm just so annoyed by them because they Kind of treat themselves as the victim but they wanted to hangout at my place and expect me to make ALL the plans, yet when i asked some question i get memey pictures as answers, how am i supposed to ""plan"" anything?! And the same person who kinda ""invited"" himself into my Home made a backhanded comment about my Planing.

Currently, my husband, baby, and I live with my parents in their home. My parents are snowbirds, so they're only here about half the year. They are well off, and do not charge us rent, which allows me to stay home with the baby. In exchange, we look after the house and do the majority of housework, and just generally try to be helpful and agreeable roommates.

Last week was my birthday, and my parents were in town for it. A few days beforehand, my mom started hinting that she had gotten me something big. She seemed really excited.

The day came, and we had a small party at home. Ordered takeout from my favorite restaurant, and my husband had gotten me a couple nice things I'd been wanting. Finally my dad brought out a large box, and my mom was practically jumping up and down. I was getting excited to. Then I opened to wrapping to find... a KitchenAid stand mixer. The mixer and accessories, all together, cost about $500.

Here's the thing. I hate cooking. I know how to do the basics, and I do my fair share of cooking in the home, but I get no joy from it. My mom knows this. We've talked about it many times. But my mom loves to cook. And she loves to bake. In fact, she's been talking about wanting one of those mixers for years.

I guess she could see the disappointment on my face, because she started trying to convince me how amazing the mixer was. She went on about all the attachments and accessories, and how it's top of the line. I tried to feign interest. I smiled and thanked my parents for getting me something so nice. But my mom was now noticeably disappointed by my reaction.

We moved on to the cake, and after dinner I was focused on getting the baby ready for bed. The next day, the mixer was still in the box, and mom started giving me a hard time about it. She kept making comments about how you'd think I'd be more appreciative of a $500 gift. And that if someone had spent $500 on her birthday gift she would've pulled it out and started using it right away. 

I went ahead and got it out and set it up just to appease her. But I still haven't used it. Honestly I don't even know what to do with it. I don't bake. I told my mom that she should feel free to give it a test drive, but she responded that it was mine, not hers.

Now she's saying that she and dad might go back to their beach house earlier than planned.

I'm just not sure what she expected. She clearly thinks I'm being an AH, but it's just so obvious that she bought that gift for her, not for me. I would've rather her spent way less on me, and gotten something I could actually use. But maybe I'm just acting like a spoiled brat. I grew up pretty privileged, so maybe my perspective is skewed.

127,1cvnqht,AITA for not apologising to my dad,"
Please ask me anyway questions and I will clarify for further information :)
I (25F) live with my parents (50s M&F). My father’s way of handling things is not the healthiest. For as long as I can remember if something had gone wrong he would give me the silent treatment, scream and then give the silent treatment again. He says that this is the only way he knows because his mom did it to him. The only time we would talk again is if I went up and apologised and he would then continue as if nothing had happened. We once didn’t speak for 7months.

I ride horses and I’m quite high ranked in the field. Recently my horse hasn’t been feeling the greatest. I say to my parents that’s he’s not feeling well and please can I get a vet out to see him. I could hear in the background to the call that my dad was not happy. While I was driving home I was doing maths in my head and I knew I could do a payment plan for the vet if I needed to.

I get home and explain the feeling that I have with my horse. My mom asked if he just needed a break and I said possibly but this could also be more because he has never felt this way before. I used an analogy: Salah wouldn’t go up to Jurgen and say something’s wrong and they would tell him to sit on the bench and rest for two weeks. They would get him checked out because he is an athlete and they would do their best for him. My horse is an athlete and he’s telling me in his way that he needs help. My dad scoffed at this (he hasn’t spoken at all and has been on his phone this entire discussion) and said it’s not the same. The thing is it is. They are athletes and my horse jumps big jumps. He needs to be taken care of. So after me trying to explain this, I was starting to get upset because it felt like I wasn’t being heard and my dad looks up from his phone to my mom smiles and laughs while pointing at me. Mocking my feelings and my attempt to help my horse.

I got so angry and I tried reasoning with him but was hit with the same scoff, smile and laugh eventually I said “It’s fine. I’ll bloody do it myself. I’ll phone the vets tomorrow and work out a payment plan. Screw you.” And left the room.
I got the vet out and there were several things wrong with my horse that he is now in rehab for. This has been about 5 weeks since this incident. My dad hasn’t spoken to me. He is waiting for me to apologise to him for storming out of the room. While yes I was in the wrong to say screw you to my dad I don’t think I am in the wrong for leaving the room and getting the vet especially after finding out there was some major issues.

Since this so many things has happened in the family: a cousin died, a friend of mine asked me to move in with her (I am), and I have also decided that in 2025 I am immigrating. Everything has made him much angrier at me and I just couldn’t care. Since I was 8 I always had to apologise even if it was a kid mistake that needed teaching.

128,1cvnjtx,AITA for saying hello to a service dog,"I was in a pet store that allows all animals, picking up cat food. And in the same aisle as me was a lady with her dog that was clearly very excited by everything around him and was looking over to me and wagging his tail and pulling to say hi. I smile and just look to the owner and say “oh he’s so handsome” and hold my hand out. 

I need to add that he was wearing one of those dog clothes which was this hoodie. (Even cuter). The woman then scowls at me and yanked him away and tells me he’s a service animal and pulls the hoodie down to see a collar saying service dog. I feel terrible as I would never EVER try and interrupt a service animal if I knew. I start to apologise perfusly and she just looks at me in disgust and keeps pulling the dog away. 

(Who at this point is still jumping and pulling towards me excitedly)

She snaps at me saying that now I’ll know better than to try pet service dogs and just shakes her head when I apologise again and walks away. I genuinely feel so bad and I’m awful when it comes to confrontation like this and I felt like I was going to cry. But looking back i don’t know if she was being unreasonable. I don’t want to claim the dog wasn’t legitimate, but by his behaviour and lack of clear sign he was one, I don’t know if he was. But with how angry and disgusted the woman was with me I just don’t know if she was right. So Reddit I come to thee for your opinion. 

(EDIT) - there was some confusion so just to rectify! I never once actually petted the dog, or went to pet him I wouldn’t touch somebody else’s dog without permission regardless of service dog status. What happened was the dog approached me very excitedly to sniff, and I held my hand for him to do so. It’s also why I spoke directly to the owner first of all when complimenting him, instead of kneeling or baby talking to get his attention. And again, this all happened before I even knew he was a “service dog” 

Am I the asshole?

129,1cvngjq,AITA for excluding my daughters new friend from a trip?,"I (29m) have planned a trip for my daughter(12) and her friends (12-13f) to go see her favourite singer. 

I paid for 5 tickets for me, my daughter (we’ll call A), her cousin (Z14) and her two friends (X&Y) to go see Olivia Rodrigo. 
I’ve paid for plane tickets across the country, 3 nights accommodation and booked 1 activity.  Both X&Y’s parents have chipped in a little and prepared dinner and spending money. One of their mum’s is tagging along as well as A’s mum, auntie and my wife. 

Overall the entire trip is mostly being funded by myself and my brother (Z’s father). I don’t mind. I love that I’m creating a memorable trip for my girl and her friends that are welcome regulars in my house. I also really don’t mind the music. We have always had hung out and listened to her, i’ve learned most of the lyrics, stayed up for announcements and everything. It’s a whole world she’s in and I’ve always been a willing participant. 

However, a new girl (G) has joined her friend group at school. She also like Olivia Rodrigo and the trip was announced after she joined the group. I quickly got a call from G’s mum telling me she was devastated she wasn’t invited. I tried to explain that the trip was planned before I realised they were even friends, but she wouldn’t have it. 

I got a call from A’s mum later asking if G could come to the trip. I explained that sure she could come, but someone would have to explain to her she couldn’t come to the show. Both she and
my wife think that I need to consider giving up my ticket and letting them go alone. No one is really sure if they’re okay with it, being that its a different city and all. But they are all good and responsible girls. I am not okay with it. 

I don’t think it’s reasonable to take my kid’s friend she’s only known for 4 months. I also don’t know if I trust letting them all go alone. The girl is nice, i know she would be eternally grateful but I think she needs to sit this one out. 

so AITA?

Previously, I lived alone with my brother, now 25(m), for about five years. We left our family home due to our emotionally abusive mother, who exhibited narcissistic tendencies. Our challenging upbringing was exacerbated by the absence of our fathers; my brother and I have different fathers, neither of whom was present in our lives, which instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility for him.

During the time we lived together, my brother, a high school dropout, pursued numerous get-rich-quick schemes, many of which bordered on scams. I shouldered our financial burden, even working as a server after losing my tech job. At one point, my brother managed to earn a substantial sum online (then worth $100k, about $1M today), but he squandered it all on gambling and weed, falling into a cycle of poor decisions and unhealthy habits.

Our relationship changed dramatically after I reconnected with my university sweetheart (after 14 years apart) - she was the love of my life, and I proposed to her after three months only. My impending marriage and relocation to another city meant that my brother needed to become independent. He kinda accused me of moving into this too fast and that IATA for forcing him to move out so quickly. Either way, I helped him secure accommodation and a job, but he quickly reverted to his previous lifestyle and was eventually evicted due to non-payment and other issues.

Fast forward to the present: after an accumulation of misguided actions, he is financially drained and legally troubled. He reached out, desperate to stay at our condo. Given the limited space and our new responsibilities as parents, my wife and I were reluctant but willing to offer him shelter under strict conditions to foster responsibility and rehabilitation: a maximum stay of six months, mandatory employment, cessation of drug use, no internet access to prevent gambling, and contributions to household chores.

My brother, however, felt these conditions were akin to imprisonment, too harsh and restrictive, and said IATA and I set him up for failure first by kicking him out before he was ready, and now not even helping him.

Because of this, we decided against accommodating him and his girlfriend. Instead, we purchased bus tickets for them to return to their city, trying to balance our family's needs with his. As they continue to struggle, he blames me for his current situation - had I never kicked him out, or had I helped him without impossible conditions, he wouldn't be homeless.

We now don't talk because of this, and I have basically abandoned my birth family.


I find myself questioning whether our stringent conditions and decision not to house him and his girlfriend were overly severe, and they are homeless cause I didn't help.

He kinda accused me of moving into this too fast and that IATA for forcing him to move out so quickly. Either way, I helped him secure accommodation and a job, but he quickly reverted to his previous lifestyle and was eventually evicted due to non-payment and other issues.

Fast forward to the present: after an accumulation of misguided actions, he is financially drained and legally troubled. He reached out, desperate to stay at our condo. Given the limited space and our new responsibilities as parents, my wife and I were reluctant but willing to offer him shelter under strict conditions to foster responsibility and rehabilitation: a maximum stay of six months, mandatory employment, cessation of drug use, no internet access to prevent gambling, and contributions to household chores.

My brother, however, felt these conditions were akin to imprisonment, too harsh and restrictive, and said IATA and I set him up for failure first by kicking him out before he was ready, and now not even helping him.

Because of this, we decided against accommodating him and his girlfriend. Instead, we purchased bus tickets for them to return to their city, trying to balance our family's needs with his. As they continue to struggle, he blames me for his current situation - had I never kicked him out, or had I helped him without impossible conditions, he wouldn't be homeless.

We now don't talk because of this, and I have basically abandoned my birth family.


I find myself questioning whether our stringent conditions and decision not to house him and his girlfriend were overly severe, and they are homeless cause I didn't help. AITA?",0.0,0.12373189628124237,0,1

135,1cvn191,AITA for refusing to go back to my originaly assigned seat on the plane ?,"Throwaway. English is not my main language, apologies for the mistakes.

I (31F) was traveling today with my 19 months old son on a plane on a 3 hour flight. 
My son, being under two, has to sit on my lap. 
I also had a big backpack with all the necessities that I keep on the floor and easily accessible. 
It can get crowded fast, but it's just how it is when you travel alone with a young child.


I got assigned a random seat (12C) at check in, and ended up being in a row with no other empty seat. Although I appreciate it when there is an empty seat next to me as it greatly improves our flight experience, It's not an expectation I have and I never ask for it at check up.

Once the boarding was completed but before take off, a flight attendant came to me and offered to move us 3 row up (9C) because there were two seats availables, and that they usually try to accommodate people with young infants. 
I was delighted and accepted right away. The flight attendant helped me move my things and explained the situation to the other passenger on row 9. 

The passenger did not appreciated it at all, she started complaining to the flight attendant that she was planning to sleep on the flight, and that it would be impossible now. That she specifically chose this seat while checking online because the row was empty and it's gonna be a nightmare now.

The flight attendant simply explained that both my seats (old and new) are Standard, that the women only paid for her own seat and that their policy is trying to accommodate young parents if possible.

The woman then told me that I should be ashamed to impose all this noise on people that are just trying to enjoy their flight. 
Especially since it wasn't even my seat and I didn't even pay for it.

Honestly, I'm really not good with confrontation, I usually end up either crying or apologizing so I just ignored her all the way, as if she didn't speak at all. That got her even more angry but she finally stopped complaining after a while.

My son ended up crying only once, I got some stinky eye and some other rude comments but all in all, the flight was way more comfortable for us this way, so I don't really regret switching seats. 
But I do wonder if I'm the AH, it's true that I didn't pay for that seat, and that it wasn't my originally assigned seat.

EDIT 2 to address some recurring themes : 

- The bag can fit under the seat, it was there during take off and landing. It was on the floor the rest of the time for easy access. I was allowed to do that the same way other passengers are allowed put our their laptops.


- My son was on my lap the whole flight (as per the Flight Attendant demand), the extra seat was just extra space to feel less crowded and not bump elbows.

- I'm overweight yes, but not extremely so.

- I'm from Europe, my son HAS to be in my lap, the flight attendant insisted on it when she offered me to switch seats. We aren't allowed to bring car seats with us, they go with luggage.

136,1cvn00c,AITA for pulling out of my friend's bridal party?,"I (22 F) was the maid of honour for my friend's (F) wedding, along with 2 other bridesmaids (Anna and Jess). Note: I was not friends with the other bridesmaids, as they were the bride's friends from elsewhere. 

The bride was not involved in the wedding/hens planning process as we wanted the activities as a surprise, and would also be paying for the bride's head for all activities. Our agreed plan/budget was $500 each. However, Anna suggested changing the plan to do a weekend trip, increasing the budget to $1,000 each factoring accommodation, food, etc. (paying for bride)

I raised my concerns with the bridesmaids bc I felt stressed dropping $1,000+ in one go for one wedding, as I do not have a fulltime job (Im desperately looking for one). I only work casually 2 days a week. I also had to use the money I'd saved for the wedding on a family emergency. The bridesmaids however, work full-time but are renting their housing.

When I brought up my stress to the bridesmaids, they tried investigating my financial details, aggresively asking me if I paid rent, what I spend my money on, why and how often I support my family financially . I explained that altho I dont pay rent, I also dont get paid as much as them. Anna said, ""so get a second job"", implying that Im not working hard enough/ I need to work harder to fund this wedding. I felt pressured by them to spend more, as they claimed that they are in worse financial positions than me, and if they can pay, I should too. They both then called me ""disrespectful"" for being concerned about money because I don't pay rent, which was unfair, as they assumed I don't have any other financial priorities in my life. 

I told the bride everything, how I felt uncomfortable and invalidated, like I wasn't allowed to feel stressed about money bc I don't pay rent. She agreed they were unnecessarily aggressive , but agreed with them that I was disrespectful for being concerned when I dont pay rent. The bride expressed her hurt in how ""quickly"" I ""threatened"" to pull out. I explained that me pulling out would not be bc of money, or that I didn't want to be her MOH, but bc of how I was treated by the bridesmaids. I'd rather pull out sooner than later to avoid more future conflicts. She ultimately agreed that I pull out, knowing that she wouldnt enjoy her day knowing that us bridesmaids had beef.

Few weeks later, I asked the bride if everything was ok between us. She said its expected to have a shift due to my ""immature actions"" and how I ""blew everything up"", and felt hurt that I quickly pulled out of the bridal party. I explained again why I pulled out (above para), and if she refused to understand how her friends made me feel which led to my decision, then I can't change her mind. She then said, ""I'm not rehashing this convo so you can feel good about being the victim"". 

For the past few weeks, I was made to feel like a shit friend and I started to believe it.

137,1cvmx40,AITA for setting a boundary over my friend discussing her relationship with me? ,"
My friend (we’re both mid thirties) has a terrible boyfriend that she’s been with on and off for 5 years but has never been happy with - he’s emotionally abusive, financially controlling, and gaslights her over everything, making her feel insane. When they got back together after a few months break (which was supposed to be permanent) and he immediately continued the same behaviour, I’d made it clear that I could no longer support her when it came to her relationship with him: this was because for around a year before that she’d been calling me in tears late at night/early morning, several times a week after they’d had an argument, and I then supported her through the break up only for her to return to him. The amount of emotional bandwidth she relied on me for throughout that whole time was disproportionate and I couldn’t deal with it again, so that’s why I set the boundary. She has made something of a big deal about this at times, including at a hen party last year - and at another one she had a breakdown about her relationship generally. Sober, she usually respects the boundary, but lately she has been blurring the lines. A few months ago she told me several times that she’d be breaking up with him, while also telling another friend they were going to be buying a house and trying for a baby. She had started sending me the familiar “I need a friend, are you free” messages that I know are her wanting to discuss her relationship, and so I tell her I’m busy because I’ve made it so clear I don’t want any involvement, especially knowing that he hasn’t changed from things she has said, and things she has told our friends. I really value my friendships (I’m single and I have a small family), so this is hard for me, and the first time I have had to set such a boundary, let alone repeat myself on it. She is incapable of being without a boyfriend, and when she is single or not getting adequate attention from men she will demand it from me, and then disappear as soon as she gets the male attention again. I’ve accepted that, and we’re part of a long standing friendship group that I love, so I don’t want to cut her out of my life, but she is so intense and I’m sick of reminding her of the boundaries because I end up feeling like a total bitch.

The only time we ever see each other is when it concerns our grandparents. I don't have much to do with my parents either. But my grandparents are different.

My grandparents had an informal party to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary and we all went. My partner of 13 years and our three kids were there. My sister was also there with her husband. At some point during the party my sister came up to me and started berating me for using two of her favorite names for my children. I still don't know for sure which ones I used that she would have wanted but I think it might have been the names of my two daughters. My only reason for the assumption is when we weren't estranged she'd only ever talk about having daughters. But we never talked about this and I never knew about baby names she might or might not like. We were already estranged when I was pregnant with my first so it never came up. She told me it was disgusting and I should change them because she's struggling with infertility and deserves to use the names when her baby finally comes. I told her she had no right to throw around demands. And I said I was not going to rename my 5 and 3 year olds for her.

I walked away and attempted to avoid a scene but she followed me to berate me some more. She called me inconsiderate and accused me of acting out of spite.

141,1cvm44u,AITA for asking out a mutual friend of my ex's and mine ,"I (20F) dated Cole (21M), and while dating we started being part of a friend group and met Vivian (24F). There were other people in that group, but the three of us especially got along together. 

After 2-3 months, Cole and I started having issues. He would disappear for days at times, cutting contact not just from me but from all his friends. At some point Cole broke up with me, saying that he isn't mentally stable enough to be in a relationship, but that he wants to stay friends. I knew he was going through a hard time and tried being understanding and supportive. I wanted to stay his friend since he had been at the time my best friend, even before he was my boyfriend. 

So for a while we tried to make it work, both of us being part of the same friend group and often hanging out with Vivian. A couple of weeks after the breakup Vivian and I started getting closer, and hit it off in DMs as well. I wasn't planning on anything happening between us at first, but I started liking her a lot. I decided to work up the courage to ask her out, and she said yes which made me very happy. 

Vivian knew of my history with Cole, and she wanted to be honest with him and tell him before going on a date with me, because he's been an important friend to her. Cole didn't take it very well, he told her he was feeling confused and started being non-communicative with us. We tried giving him space knowing that he sometimes needs time alone, and that he often has a hard time processing his feelings. 

A few days later we found out that he left the friend group, telling our friends that he's upset with us for being insensitive and making him feel unincluded. He's not willing to talk with either of us.

142,1cvly4r,AITA I’m pissed friend canceled last minute,"My birthday was last week and I had plans with my friends that fell through. Initially since my birthdate fell on a weekday I had planned to go to the spa and grab dinner later with a friend. I doublechecked with them day of and they confirmed. By 6pm I called them and they told me that they had some work to finish up and they would let me know  in 15 minutes and that now they  needed a car seat because of an unexpected change. I didn’t get upset I just said keep me posted because we can always reschedule. 

Two hours and half later they called me saying we can still go to dinner despite the restaurant doing their last seating at 9pm it was 8:36pm.  At this point I’m in my pjs and annoyed because I honestly had no problem ordering in and I was sure we weren’t going to make it on time. I got dressed and went anyway because they were persistent on trying. We got to the restaurant at 9:08 and they confirmed they were no longer seating but I opted to ask the bar server if I could still order to go since I didn’t eat, while my friend was getting herself together in the car. Because it was my birthday she agreed and let us order drinks and food to go. We stayed at the restaurant for 35 minutes. 

The following day I called them to confirm the weekends plans they had made for my birthday. They agreed but let know they had something to do Saturday night.  Saturday comes I call them bright and early no answer. They called back two hours later saying they would have to do a rain check. Fine, but considering they knew from the night before (based on that morning’s conservation) I was pissed. 

I called at 7am because the plans were to leave by 9-930am they called me back at 9.  I called them back and simply and calmly stated that I understand you have a lot going on, and I don’t mind rescheduling plans. However, it would be nice if you communicated these things in a timely manner that way I have a chance to plan accordingly because at this point I’m frustrated. The place is a  brunch spot that tends to get packed quickly so ideally you want to be there before 10. She agreed that she could have communicated better, we hung up. Less than five minutes later she calls back and stated I have high expectations for her and that I’m ungrateful. I told her I knew she was going to cancel and my expectations were far from high. As far calling ungrateful I just feel like she set up these plans and then delayed and canceled them. Like am I supposed to be grateful for your 30 minute appearance? She then pointed out things that upset her like me having a slight attitude when she picked me up for dinner and that I assumed the rest of the day’s plans were cancelled too (and they were because I didn’t hear from her again) and other situations outside of our friendship that were frustrating her. Which to me seems like excuses because I asked for nothing but communication. Although I tried to be considerate she in turn just got upset. mind you we’ve been friends for over 20 years we are in our 30’s. This is not the first time she has a habit of waiting til the last minute to cancel or simply just not answer the phone.

143,1cvlmxh,AITA for leaving my 72 year old dad on the side of the road?,"My dad \[72M\] went cycling this Sunday morning and ran into issues with his bike close to where I \[30F\] live. I woke up around 08:30 am with a couple of missed calls and called him back about 15 minutes later. He asked if I could give him a lift, and I agreed.

He gave vague directions, mentioning landmarks like the ""Grand Spice"" hotel and where fishermen sell fish—things that aren't on Google Maps. My dad hates using Google Maps and is difficult with directions. I eventually found him after not too long, only calling him once to clarify his location, though he hung up on me in the midst of it.

He loaded his bike into my car, and we drove off. I explained that I struggled to follow his directions because I don’t eat fish and this is local knowledge, so I wouldn’t know where the fishermen sell fish. This upset him. As we passed the ""Sugar Reef"" hotel, which he referred to as the ""Grand Spice"" hotel (an old name I was unaware of and how I explained there was no way I would have known the hotel by this name), he became enraged. He started screaming, bashing the dashboard, and stomping his feet while I was driving. I stopped the car and asked if he wanted to make his own way home. He got out, leaving the bike with me. I drove off.

I've been in a good place lately—regular therapy, eating well, exercising and taking accountability for myself. This incident felt out of place with how everything else has been going. I don't feel anger, just disappointment that a simple thing got so out of hand.

I haven't had much contact with my dad lately, and things have been peaceful. Now it feels like this incident has disturbed that peace. I don't want to cut him out of my life, but I also don't want to tolerate such behavior. Reflecting back, this was normal behavior for him while I was growing up. As I think about having kids myself, I realize this isn't right. I wouldn't want my child to witness or experience this.

I do have issues like low self-esteem, shame, social anxiety, and lack of trust, which I believe were largely fueled by my childhood with him. My mum shares the same sentiment for herself. For context, they are divorced now, but there was a huge power imbalance with a 20-year age gap between them. He married my mum at 18; she came from a poor background, and he was the ""one with the money and executive control."" I've worked my way to the point where I don't rely on him anymore, and my life feels better for it. I can do favors for him now, which I feel good about.

I love both my parents, but I know neither of them, especially my dad, would consider therapy. They are both very rigid, and I don't think they will change, so I just focus on myself.

I mean at much one hour on the go and then I play some more after an hour or a couple hours. That also means that if I can't play in the morning I'd have less time in the afternoon due to having to take a break in between hours.

Also, you are the godfather of M6 and by agreeing to that you should feel at least some responsibility to take care of him"".  I was mildly shocked at that and told her that this is again her not owning up to her own life choices and wanting others to take care of whatever mess she got herself into.

We weren't being super loud or anything, but she woke up early and her bedroom is right next door to ours.  She texted my wife and I later that day ""I could hear you this morning.  GROSS!!!!! 🤮🤮🤮""

I think we've done a pretty good job of having healthy discussions with our kids about sex and relationships over the years.  But the fact that Amy texted us rather than talking to us gave the impression she didn't really want to have a discussion about it.  And I get that.

151,1cvkp9f,AITA for refusing MIL help?,"I (F31) am about to finish my degree and my final thesis was due on Thursday. I have almost 2 y son and a husband whose working hours are from 8 am to 9 pm. I work full time myself. Normally, we all leave the house around 6:30 am, leave the kid in a daycare around 7 am and both head to our works (our offices are 5 min apart of walking distance). I pick up my son from day care around 5 pm and head home. We both spend some time and the  around 7 pm I will put him to sleep, which takes time, so he is asleep around 7:30 pm and I leave his bed around 8pm. This is to give the understanding how the usual day looks like. 
Normally, both, husband and I plan everyhting in advance, but life happens, our son gets sick, I get sick. This happened two weeks before said deadline, so my plans went down the sink.
So, Thursday was a very hard day, in the morning it was obvious that I need help, my husband tried to change his workload, but his boss said no, and he suggested to call his mom. I texted her saying, sorry for such a short notice, but, everything slipped out of my hands and it would be great if she could come after work to be with my son and maybe, put him to sleep, as the deadline was today. She said no, I said I understand, and did not push more. I called my boss, and asked if it would be ok, if I would do what’s urgent and finish everything on Sunday, she said ok. So, after the noon, when I finalized most important tasks from my work, I sat down to my thesis. My son spend most of the day playing near me, and watching Bluey. In the evening I put him down to sleep and again sat down to make the changes in my paper. I managed to correct and submit my thesis 30 min before the deadline. 
On Friday morning, my MIL texted me, she can come after her work today to be with my son, so I could do my uni stuff, I politely declined and mentioned that I had already subimitted my paper yeasterday, so I want to spend Friday evening with my son, to compensate for yesterday. She didn’t reply and I thought we were good. 
On Saturday, we had plans with MIL and FIL to go spend the day in the park and bbq since the weather was nice (we agreed on that two weeks in advance). My husband called her to inform we were running a bit late, she said she and FIL are not comming. He asked why and she said it’s because of me, and will not come, unless I apologise. To say I was shocked would be an understatement of the year. My husband asked what have happened, I  showed him the messages. He called his father, and MIL thinks, I refused her help on purpose, so she would feel bad. Honestly, I have so much going on in my life rn, that I have neither time nor will to read into other people feelings.
I do not see why I need to apologise. My husband is on my side, since we share the view, that we can always ask for help, and other people always has a right to say no.

152,1cvknqy,AITA for holding grudges against ppl who hurt my gf?,"My (25F) gf and I (24NB) were planning on having a birthday party for the both of us, since they're only days apart and I'm going to be visiting her (we are long distance) for the week. The ppl invited are just her friends whom I get along pretty well. The issue came around later when she asked me if she could invite another friend.

I don't like this friend bc of some stuff he did and said. Without giving away too much, he treated her badly for the sake of ""humor"" to the point other friends asked her why she would let him treat her like that. They fought and fell apart last year and then at the beginning of this one he asked her to reconnect. He apologized but told her that he was just waiting for her to reach out (cause she used to do that every time). At the end, she told him that they couldn't go back to what they were, but they could see how things go. She asked for my opinion and I told her that I wouldn't trust him, but that it was her choice. This doesn't mean I don't have my own thoughts about it. He was immature and hurt her. She was dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts and had depressive episodes after all went down.

She told me she wouldn't want to hang out with him just the two of them like before, but that she wouldn't avoid him if he happen to be in the same place. Now she asked me how I would feel if we invite him. I don't like him and I would rather not see him, if it can be avoided. I wouldn't have said anything if it was just her party bc she has the right to invite whoever she wants, but since it was a celebration for the both of us and she asked, I was honest. This didn't sit right with her.

We argued and she told me she wanted to invite him anyways, and if I didn't want him there, we should do separate parties so she can invite him to hers. Under normal circumstances, that would've been fine. But as I established before, we are long distance. None of my friends are going to celebrate with me there, so I think the idea is dumb; the only person who's not going to be invited to mine is him, the rest of the guests would be the same!

I didn't like the fact that she asked me like I had a choice at all, because at the end it was either we invite him or you make your own party, but I can compromise on it. I told her it was fine. I'm not going to fill the room with negative energy just bc of this, and the things he did are not unforgivable crimes. He's just a bad friend.

What has been bothering me now is that aftwards, she told me that it doesn't make sense that I would hold a grudge towards the ppl that are in her life.

I had issues with friends in the past and exes that were toxic, and the ppl around me despise them. These problems are none of their business, I know, but isn't it normal to hate them if they hurt me? I asked her what does she think about those ppl, and she told me she doesn't have any kind of resentment towards them bc is not her place.

154,1cvkfo4,AITA for suggesting that we stay elsewhere during a family vacation?,"My wife and I have a 2 year old daughter—let’s call her Anna—and we’re currently on a family vacation in Hawaii with my parents and my in-laws (7 people total). We are staying at my father’s timeshare, which he periodically invites us to. The two pairs of grandparents adore Anna and seem to get along with each other. Anna is undergoing potty-training right now, and as with all potty-training, there are occasional accidents. 

We arrived in Hawaii two days ago, and she had quite a few accidents - I suspect because she’s dealing with an unfamiliar place and new people. Right before dinner, Anna had an accident on the pullout sofa, which necessitated a call to housekeeping to swap out sheets and cushions. My dad wasn’t happy. 

When all 7 of us sat down shortly afterward for dinner, my dad sat down and the first thing out of his mouth was, “Anna is out of control, isn’t she.” Bear in mind Anna was sitting right across from him at the table. I let it slide and continued eating, and my wife said something to try to brush it off. Then, my dad suggested that we put Anna back in diapers and that she not be allowed on the bed or the couch. I responded by saying that I didn’t want to do that and that potty-training is a process that has highs and lows. My dad then remarked that it would be problematic if she had an accident on the carpet because it’d be hard to clean up. In my mind, I thought to myself, “So you don’t want her on the bed, couch, or carpet—where is she supposed to hang out the whole time, the bathroom??” At that point, I was frustrated and said something to the extent of, “If Anna’s accidents are too big of a problem, we can always find another place to stay at.”

That’s when my dad blew up. He accused me of threatening him and of being disrespectful. It seemed that he took my suggestion as a threat of leaving, and he made very clear that he felt offended. He also said that I needed to “be careful with what I say and show respect to your parents.” I responded by repeatedly telling him that I didn’t threaten him nor intend for him to be threatened. He responded that “it doesn’t matter what your intent was, because I feel threatened.” At this point I was really upset, so I said something I probably shouldn’t have, remarking that he was “too easily threatened.”

My dad then demanded that I apologize to him. I didn’t feel that I had to, but I half-heartedly apologized because I wanted the argument to end and because it was making things super uncomfortable for my in-laws who were also sitting at the table and eating dinner through all of this.

She’s new to my country having been here for 5 months. She doesn’t have family here. 

She’s working a casual job as a health care aid. It doesn’t pay well. 

I have been helping her with rides to work and have taken her for hookah numerous times since it is what she has said helps her relax. 

I pay for the hookah and I buy her small meals from time to Time. It was her birthday and I tried to make it very special. I took her to a nice scenic town famous for its views and tourism. We adventured and I bought her a couple of nice gifts and wrapped them.  I put a lot of effort to make her feel special. 

I have not pushed her for intimacy although we have kissed a few times. No passionate kissing either and I have not asked her for that since I’m happy playing it slow.   I do enjoy spending time with her and developing a bond which we have so far. 

Anyway, she needs to find a new room to rent in the city. Since she only works casually and doesn’t make much money she is in a bind. She needs a new place but she fears she cannot afford rent and the damage deposit. 

I have been helping her drive to vacant rooms to view all over the city this last week with nothing but a generous spirit hoping to help her. 

So tonight she asked me to give her money for the damage deposit: “if I could help her”. 

I replied by saying: “ I don’t feel comfortable just giving you 500 dollars. What if I lend it to you? No expectations on an immediate return but some assurance that you will return it to me some time or some way since I don’t want to feel taken advantage of.”  

By someway I don’t mean sex either. I mean like find a way to make it up to me when you find more stability. 

I’m between jobs rn and I was just in an accident and am paying for things out of pocket so things are kind of tight. 

Once I find a new job I will feel more secure financially. However rn, I feel it’s a bit much to ask for a 500 dollar gift when I have been so generous already with my time, my vehicle, my treats for hookah with is like 45-60 bucks a date and all the meals I have bought. 

I understand she’s in a bit of a predicament and probably wouldn’t want to ask me if the circumstances were different thus I’m a bit torn. Part of me wants to help but part of me wants to remain cautious.

Once I find a new job I will feel more secure financially. However rn, I feel it’s a bit much to ask for a 500 dollar gift when I have been so generous already with my time, my vehicle, my treats for hookah with is like 45-60 bucks a date and all the meals I have bought. 

I understand she’s in a bit of a predicament and probably wouldn’t want to ask me if the circumstances were different thus I’m a bit torn. Part of me wants to help but part of me wants to remain cautious. 

AITAH for asking for her to repay me the money she needs even if I say there is no immediate request for a return ?

157,1cvjrrc,AITA for spending more time with my in-laws than with my own family ?,"Hi there. My gf and I (both 25) have been together for over 3 years and we’re now engaged and would like to get married in the next 18 months.

There’s been a lot of issues between my in-laws and my family but especially between my gf and my family, especially with my mother. They described my gf as manipulative, gold digger and so on… My family and my in-laws don’t talk to each other anymore because of that and I’m the one on both sides of the « families relationships »

My in-laws earn more money together than my parents and thus have a better lifestyle than my family. They have 2 children with my gf being the younger and she has her own bedroom at my in-laws place. 

I am the eldest of 3 kids and my 2 brothers ( 24 and 20 ) still live with my parents. My bedroom was given to my younger brother when I left my parents for work. Also, my gf and I come from the same city so our parents live like 15 mins apart.

Coming to the point: I’ve been off for the last 3 weeks and decided to visit my parents. My gf and I stayed there for like a week (spaced days but 3 times 2 days spent there). My parents always complain that I don’t spent time with them and my brothers but when I visit them, one of my brother is at work and the other one is away with his gf. Also, when I visit them, we spend all the time at home, watching Netflix or whatever and it bores the hell out of me. My mom is talking 24/7 about money, how she got a deal on this, how much is this worth and the way she dresses to make you think that she’s rich when she’s not. She’s also very judgmental about me and my decisions: I decided to get my ear pierced and she didn’t like it at all ( literally told me wtf is that ), I gained a lot of weight for the past 4 years and she keeps reminiscing the time when I was thin, always judging about my body and appearance and it really starts to piss me off. She clearly has some inferiority complex with money, especially with my in-laws. Also, I just turned 25 and I didn’t expect a present from my parents because they didn’t give anything for the last 5 birthdays and apparently they bought this all in 1 IPhone charging station ( I already have one ) which they wanted to give me. Tbh it looked like they just didn’t think about a gift at all and they tried to hide it. I didn’t feel disappointed at all but I just felt ashamed for them like if you didn’t think about it just say it to me.

158,1cvjr6z,AITA (Or in this case was I the asshole) for telling my friends how I felt when I didn't get invited to one of their birthday celebrations?,"Tldr: I expressed how I felt to my friends and they called me dramatic for it. 

For context, I (26f) have been in this friend group (23f, 25m, 23m) for over a year now and have been best friends with 23f since 2016. We all do many things together and shared many great moments. We all are there for each other when needed as well. Whenever there is a celebration of a birthday or a special occasion, everyone is on top of letting each other know............until recently. 

It was recently 23m's birthday (I'm not giving out their full names due to privacy) and his mom (Who knows me well by the way and has considered me like her own daughter) coordinated a get together at downtown Disneyland with everyone else along with 23m's other friends but she NEVER told me about this at all. How I found this out? Well, last night I saw a post from 23m posting everyone together and how ""All of his special friends made his day special."" 

When I saw this.......I felt hurt. I felt hurt, and even betrayed that I didn't hear about any of this. Many feelings were spiraling within my mind and I was seriously tempted at times to explode my anger on them and cuss them out. However, I knew better and didn't do that. I spent all day today processing this by asking others for advice along with carefully choosing what to say to my friends.

I sent it out to them and I had no intention of being ill willed nor did I cuss them out. Many people on my online discord group encouraged me to express how I felt to them. I sent this out and I got a reply from 23m and 25m.........and I got some serious backlash from them. 23m did apologize for this yes, however, he said that I was taking it out on him and he wasn't the one that coordinated this whole thing. Mind you, this was the first I heard that his mom was the one who organized this. Not him. I do understand where he's coming from since he didn't know either. Now with 25m's response? He said that I wasn't being a good friend and how I was in the wrong for saying this. He told me that I upsetted 23m and how I was being dramatic or angry.

I'll tell you, when I first saw this I was fuming with anger. I was told to express how I feel and I get told thst I was being dramatic and how I ""ruined"" 23m's mood? I feel attacked here all because I was expressing my hurt. I did my best to word it in a way that didn't hurt anyone. 

But guys, I must ask though, was I wrong for expressing how I felt to my friends for not getting an invite? Or even to his mom who knows me well and tbh, my friends could have said something too. Sure, this whole get together was last minute but I cannot help but feel hurt here. I literally cried myself to sleep last night over this and even now due to their response. But then, another half of me feels as if I was the one being too dramatic or out of line. Am I the asshole here?

My friends don’t have a job and from my perspective at least and from what they’ve told me, they haven’t been super proactive about finding a job. They’ve been living off their savings to pay for the initial stuff that we booked. Our trip is right around the corner and they’re basically telling me they have no money. We are still going to go but it seems like I have to compromise on certain experiences because they can’t afford it. We did talk about our expectations early on about what we wanted from the trip and it was obviously under the impression that they would find a job since then. Obviously that hasn’t been happening. While I also understand our economy right now isn’t great and the current state of the job market, it’s just frustrating that they had a whole year to figure something out (doing a part time or something) and they didn’t. There were a few extenuating circumstances here and there but there was also plenty of times when they were picky about applying to jobs. 

I almost feel guilty for being frustrated and upset. Like I’m being spoiled or bratty but in my head it’s just seems like there were some solutions that they could’ve figured out but they just left it until the 11th hour. It’s my first time going to Europe and I have the money to be able to do stuff and I want to have fun with my friends but I feel like now I have to compromise on my experience because they don’t have the money to do anything… (at this point why go to Europe)

161,1cviwfm,AITA for inviting a friend who’s mad at me to my party? ,"
I (22F) invited my partner’s friend lets call him Don (23M) to my birthday party.

For context, roughly 6-7months ago I brought up the idea of a game night to Don and the rest of my partners friends. I wanted the whole game night thing to happen since about 2 months before I brought it up. I invited them thinking it would be a fun activity to merge my friend group and their friend group. Next thing you know, Don brought it up in their gc.

While in the process of planning and inviting, Don asked the gc if it was okay for the guys who had gfs to go. My partner(23M) said ""Yeah well *insert my name*'s gonna be there. Idk about you guys."" Don's gf apparently saw this chat and took offense. Apparently she felt like we were outcasting her. For context, they're in a long distance relationship and that gc wasn't even a general gc but like their guys gc(friendgroup gc)

The gf, lets call her krishna, took major offense on what we did on the count that we didn't consider her feelings that unfamiliar people would be present in said game night. I just wanted to invite my friends because it was my game night to host too?? Anw long story short, the overnight/gamenight plan was reduced to a boys night with their friend group and because of the whole fiasco I didn't get to host it nor attend in the end. 

Ff to today, I invited Don for my birthday. I asked my partner to dm Don asking him if he wants to come since him and my partner are close. Don and Krishna were once again offended with the invite because I was just repeating the same offensive thing(which I honestly do not understand) I did last time. Don said that by not sending the invite through the groupchat, we were not considering Krishnas feelings regarding the outcasting and unfamiliar people. First of all, if she didnt live thousands of kilometers away, I would have added her to the guest count. But since shes far away, its safe to assume I can count that she wont be joining. We’re not actively excluding her it was just a fact that she could not come and I had to familiarize the guestlist asap. Second, there would understandably be other unfamiliar people to them because ITS MY BIRTHDAY. If it was their friend gathering sure expect no other people. But I have my own set of friends so ur gonna have expect them to be there on my birthday. Third, the invite was done through dm not because we were outcasting her but because I told my partner he could only invite a limited number of people to the party because he has way too many friends and I can only cater a few additional people to the guestlist due to financial restrictions. If he sent the invite to the whole gc, I might have had to cater to more people than I accounted for. Lastly, everyone else was invited through dm. It wasnt a singling out situation.

Sam gets ill very easily and feels down a lot. He becomes very clingy and tired during these episodes. I don’t need medical advice, we know why this happens and are dealing accordingly.

She invited me and my brothers families for dinner the other night and while we were there, Sam started to feel down and laid down on my lap. He was playing with my nieces (8 and 10) and just stopped and ran to me which surprised them. The girls got over it after my brother told them Sam was tired but my mom seemed moody.

I didn’t want to start anything so I was fine ignoring her but she said “you know that isn’t healthy right?” I explained to her that we know what we’re doing and do not need her advice. She sort of rolled her eyes and then said “Well I still think this is all very odd.” She then clapped her hands near my son’s head to try and wake him up which startled him and he began to cry. This seemed to bother my mom some more because “how weak hearted is he that a small clap brings him to tears.” 

I was pretty angry at this point so I called my husband over (he was sitting in the garden with my brothers), told him we were leaving and gave Sam to him while I collected my things. She then started making “jokes” about how her granddaughters are “manlier” than her grandson and I just snapped and told my mom that she needs to shut the fuck up and that the way she treats children is borderline psychotic. I then basically called her crazy before storming out. 

My mom’s been spamming me with texts calling me a drama queen and saying that I had no right to call her psychotic because she raised me and my brothers well.

My entire life with my sister has sucked. The only memories I have with her is having everything stolen from me and treated like garbage. My birth giver has never stepped up and actually disciplined her when she had done something wrong. My father was very distant in every way so he never really dealt with it either. 

I didn’t really have a relationship with my dad for a long time because he was so distant and a closed minded person in my early years so it was hard to talk to him. I’ve had money stolen from me, clothes, jewellery, art supplies, you think of it- she’s stolen it. Even when I had moved back with my dad after couch surfing for a few years she had continued to steal from me. My mother wasn’t in the picture at this point as she had kicked me out years prior so and my father worked FIFO so it was just me and my two siblings. 

During this time I struggled with mental health out of anxiety of all my life belongings I had left being taken. She had the audacity to even steal lingerie and sex toys!!!! Who does that!!!!! Absolutely vile. Anyway. I moved out secretly and quickly to a new place to get away from her because I just couldn’t stand her anymore. My father had passed away recently which created many more issues which continue to happen. 

I went to stay with a family member with my siblings during all the funeral arrangements etc and I had made something using his floral arrangement that sat on his casket. I left it out to dry in the room I was staying in and low and behold. Poof, gone. I was livid!!!! I ended up speaking to the family member there and nothing was dealt with so I packed my stuff and up I left because I was ready to be the next one in a casket. 

I got called dramatic and that I need to go to anger management classes because I blew up big time over the constant year after year of having my things stolen especially such a meaningful piece. I was told I need to pull my head out of my a$$ and stop being so upset over nothing almost like my father didn’t recently die as well to add to my emotions. I was treated like I was a problem with a problem I caused myself. 

So am I the asshole for flipping out over this. I haven’t spoken to any family members since besides the ones that show me respect and compassion.

I went to stay with a family member with my siblings during all the funeral arrangements etc and I had made something using his floral arrangement that sat on his casket. I left it out to dry in the room I was staying in and low and behold. Poof, gone. I was livid!!!! I ended up speaking to the family member there and nothing was dealt with so I packed my stuff and up I left because I was ready to be the next one in a casket. 

I got called dramatic and that I need to go to anger management classes because I blew up big time over the constant year after year of having my things stolen especially such a meaningful piece. I was told I need to pull my head out of my a$$ and stop being so upset over nothing almost like my father didn’t recently die as well to add to my emotions. I was treated like I was a problem with a problem I caused myself. 

So am I the asshole for flipping out over this. I haven’t spoken to any family members since besides the ones that show me respect and compassion.

164,1cvi8sv,AITA for telling my family to get over my half brother's decisions and life and saying they're saying asshole things?,"So I (23f) have a half brother whose in his mid to late 30s. I also have two older brothers 25 and 26. We don't have a relationship with our half brother, dad's child from his first wife. Dad was widowered and my mom came into their lives 3.5 years after half brother's mom died. Half brother never liked my mom and according to my brothers he was always super clear that mom would never mean anything to him and he used to say some pretty nasty shit to mom which dad would never take well and that their earliest memories are of a lot of chaos and fights. I don't really remember living with him or seeing him. But what I do remember of him wasn't pleasant and I knew he didn't want us (me and brothers) for siblings.

My family (extended and parents) always said he'd grow up and regret treating mom like shit. That he'd be a stepparent himself in the future or becoming a parent would teach him. Why they were so certain he'd want to marry and have kids I have no idea but they were always positive he would end up a stepparent and would end up with bio kids as well. My brothers and I always just accepted that we were a three person sibling set, not a four person sibling set. We never expected a relationship with him or his family.

I guess some of the extended family know he's married now and has three kids and isn't a stepparent. It annoyed some of them so much because they really felt he needed to become a stepparent but mom was really heartbroken that he could become a dad and settle down as a husband and father and still hate her so much to want nothing to do with her/us. My dad's really weird around old family photos now and especially the photos of him and his first wife with half brother that they have in their living room.

My brothers and I stayed with our parents for a few nights last week and when extended family came over half brother became a topic of conversation and again it was about him being married with kids and how bothered they are that he didn't come around because of that and again with the disappointment that he wasn't taught a lesson by becoming a stepdad. I told them they need to get over what's going on in his life because we're not a part of it and everyone needs to accept it. I also said talking like assholes by wishing him to be miserable and have a hard life doesn't make them look so great. My brother's agreed with me and so did mom. But everyone else, even dad, was kind of like, we have every right to be disappointed by how things worked out. And I'm taking stuff out of context.

My older brother lost his life because of me when I was 16. He passed away right infront of me. To honor my brother, my parents and I have started celebrating his birthday by spending time together typically doing things that he liked. 

I spend time with my parents regardless, but it's different on his birthday because it's more focused on him and only him. His birthday is this Wednesday and 2 days ago my wife told me that she doesn't feel comfortable with the idea of me continuing to celebrate his birthday because she feels like I'm holding onto to someone that's no longer here. She believes it's doing more harm than good for my parents and I to continue celebrating because it's not giving us the opportunity to move on.


she told me that she worries about me and she'll feel better if I try therapy again to help better myself. This was all shocking to me because my parents and I have been doing it way before we even got together and it made me upset that she was implying that something was wrong with us honoring him.

The therapy suggestion is not something out of the ordinary for her to suggest when ever I talk about him, however her suggesting that I completely skip celebrating his birthday was. I told her that I appreciated her input, but I didn't ask for it and I wasn't asking for her permission to attend. This upset her as she was ""trying to help."" I told her once again that I appreciated It but I did not ask for help nor did I need it. 

She didn't drop it and it was pissing me off. I told her that I didn't care what she thinks is right, my parents and I are gonna continue to celebrate my brother the way we've been doing. This upset her and she  told me that she'll be very hurt If I choose to go because it'll affect how she views me and where she stands in my life? 

I make time for her every day of the year. I don't see why I can't prioritize something I enjoy doing with my parents once a year. I'm planning on going regardless. I don't understand what's gotten into her but she's been with me for 6 years and this tradition isn't something that just started.

I say no, and had to stay by myself for the whole evening. I just leave by myself once done, considering they had left me to fend for myself.

So it fell onto me to let my mom move in back in March. I was under the assumption that my mom was flat broke. My out of state sister was the one handling her finances.

We have been through some serious things together, he has a pretty bad past and his living situation is not good so Ive let him stay with my family before. Despite this I feel like hes been at a point for a few months now where he is too dependent on me.



One of the main things he uses to cope with everything is weed. Believe me I dont have any problems with that but everytime he starts using it again he becomes insanely addicted for as long as he can get his hands on it until hes basically forced to be sober again due to just not having access for whatever reason. This has been a constant cycle as long as Ive known him but the past couple months its gotten especially awful as his situation at home got even worse and he has this new friend now who enables his addiction. Honestly its made him kind of terrible to deal with, but thats another rant so I'll try to just end it here.



What actually happened is about a week ago he asks me if I can drive him to go pick up weed/nic/whatever and I almost always drive him but since it's been getting really bad(pretty much high all day every day no matter where he is) and he almost always has me get it for him I decided I was gonna just say no this time. He starts borderline begging me saying he'll pay me and that he just really needs it this time(he says this every time) and I tell him I'm just not going to. He freaks out and says I was cancelling important plans that he talked about(he hadnt brought this up a single time until this conversation), he then goes on to say things like I'm self righteous and I never consider other peoples feelings. I will be fair and say I didnt give him much of an apology, but I think I was fairly patient with him. I never said anything bad about what he was doing just that I thought it was reasonable for me to not want to go. Atp I just stopped the conversation as it was getting nowhere.



I thought that would be it because he hadnt said a word to me in days since then. But yesterday he texts me saying he needs me to drive him to work and I'm the only person he could get to do it in time. Even though the other day annoyed me I didn't have a reason to say no and I dont want to get him in trouble so I said I would drive him, but after I say yes he once again asks if I can pick up some weed for him before we go to his work. I told him no and he said he would just find someone else, and again he hasn't talked to me since.



I dont wanna make a huge deal out of it, at the end of the day it's just a car ride but tbh the only person acting like its so important is him. I wanna be there for him but this is all he ever wants anymore, he only wants to hang out if theres some form of drugs involved and he only texts me asking for rides.

So I (30M) was staying for the weekend with my mom (53F) and the rest of the family, to cwlebrate my youngest brother's (M19) birthday.

Some backstory here - my youngest brother is very good with technology and online marketing, so a few months back I gave him my old computer that had broken down so he could fix it and sell it, in exchange for paying his expenses and giving him 30% of any profits he makes. However, he has been going through a slightly delayed teenage angsty phace and has not got around to doing it yet, so I left it with him with the hope he gets around to doing it.
Also, my mom and stepdad (70M) have been wanting a new computer for a while, but were not willing to pay for one (they are very bad at saving and keep running up debts while spending loads on useless things).

Anyway, last night I see him working on the computer, so I go over and see that it has been fixed! I ask him what is up, and my stepdad comes over and says that ""I got it fixed so that we can have a computer at home"" - just like that, without even asking me! My brother nodded in agreement, which tells me that he knew about all this.

Of course I get annoyed at my stepdad, and I tell him that ""This computer is mine, and if you want it you have to pay me for it"" - a remark which prompted an angry outburst from my stepdad who immediately started demanding for his $120 back (I converted all costs to USD for the sake of this post), which prompted me to take out my phone and right away I transferred him $120 for his costs, which caused him to go - still fuming - out the house. I took the computer and went into the room I was sleeping in.

My mom came back an hour later (10 PM by now) and asked what had gone wrong, and my sister (24F) told her the story. She then went to the room I was in and asked about the computer, and when I stated my demands she got really upset and said that ""she will not speak about money, and if I want it so much just take it and they will buy a new one"". 

I later ask my sister what had gone wrong, and she said ""We don't take money from family""... Now I think that since I bought this computer with my own money, and since it was a gaming laptop with great specs that can get at least $450 on the second-hand market in my country and that would cost at least $1,500 to replace, I am entitled to some sort of compensation for my property - and that giving it to them for a 20% discount on this price ($360 - they will not be able to get anything even remotely comparable for that price) is more than fair. However, my mom, sister and stepdad are still mad at me while my 2 brothers (23M and 19M) say that they think I was right but should have just given in so my mom will not be mad.

172,1cvgvby,WIBTA for giving my friend the ultimatum not to invite his other friends around me again?,"So I(M18) have been friends with my buddy, we'll call him Mark (M18) for about two years. We have a small friendship circle of about 4 people who I'm absolutely fine with and have also known for around two years.  We have Sarah (F18) and my roommate Josh (M19) who are also always coming along with us. My issue is with the other company that my friend Mark keeps. 

So two days ago on Friday we all decided on a whim to go and have some fun as Josh had managed to land a part time job he didn't think he would get. Now Mark is a good guy, but he also fits into that wannabe gangster area. He likes to get into fights and carry weapons but he's never been a problem for me, Sarah or Josh so he's been nice.

So we were at a rooftop bar, and just talking and joking when mark got a call from his buddy Jack (M18). Jack is also someone I've met quite a few times, and was also quite nice to me, but again very much a wannabe gangster who has been in some legal trouble before. Well he was with two friends of his who were 17, neither of them were people I know. Mark ended up bringing us all out to hang out with jack and these two, which wasn't an issue as I didn't know what they were going to do. Instantly I could tell they were on some kind of substance and this was confirmed when I saw the girl and guy each pop a 'Pinger'. For those reading who aren't well versed in what that means, it's essentially a mystery pill. It's also been a leading cause of overdose. I was instantly uncomfortable. 

Josh, Sarah and I wanted to leave. Mark however had different ideas and kept hanging around and asking us to chill out. Well we then saw the dude do a line of some nasty stuff and we were even more worried. An older bloke saw the girl who was now panicking and looked at her confused. This triggered the guy who did the snort and he instantly tried to press the guy, who ran off into a restaurant. I was prepared to jump to the old fellas defence, but luckily the staff of the restaurant locked the door and called the police.

I'm now very uncomfortable going out and about with mark as I don't want to deal with that nonsense, and I'm wondering if I would be the asshole if I was to kinda give him the 'Invite those people around me again, I'm not gonna hang out with you anymore' deal?

174,1cvgo7l,AITA- I don't think my dad wants to be my dad,"AITA- My family and I have always had issues, particularly with my dad. I'm turning 20 soon, and in February, I asked my dad about having a birthday dinner. He's always struggled with dates, so I confirmed the date with him multiple times through various means. He assured me it was okay each time. To accommodate him, I didn't invite my maternal grandpa and step-grandma because he doesn't get along with them, nor my mum or maternal grandma to avoid him feeling 'outnumbered.'  
  
I live with my maternal grandpa and step-grandma while at college, which my dad isn't happy about, even though it saves money. Since my brothers likely couldn’t make it due to work, I invited my maternal grandpa and step-grandma after clearing it with my dad. He disliked it. During this conversation, he mentioned he was working on my birthday and couldn’t attend, despite his previous confirmations. Upset, I went to my mum's house to cool off.  
  
A few days later, I visited my dad’s house to see my younger brothers. My dad was rude to us, so I left and texted him to cancel our camping trip. We've always gone camping, but this year was special because we planned to go in May and do a hike we've wanted for years. Given his rudeness and lack of apology, I felt it wouldn’t be fun anymore.  
  
In response, my dad blew up about me missing the last seven Christmases. When I was younger, Christmas was split between my parents, but from age 14, I could choose where to spend it. Often, my dad had work and didn’t make plans, so I went with my mum to visit family. I always spent time with him during the holidays, just not always on Christmas Day. Despite this, he still holds it against me.  
  
Now, we're arguing over text. It's not about him missing my birthday but his lack of remorse for messing up again. I've given him several months' notice and even considered not inviting my grandparents for his sake. This pattern has happened multiple times: he almost missed my high school graduation, dinners, dance recitals, concerts, and even needed coaxing to attend his niece's baby shower. I'm frustrated because I’ve tried everything, but he only seems to be mad about me not spending Christmas with him when I was younger. AITA?

176,1cvg8jz,AITA for walking out of the bridal salon when I found out my friends were making fun of me behind my back? ,"I have two friends: Gaby and Shelly. All of us are 23, if that matters. We were roommates in college and stayed in the same city after graduation. While the three of us are close, I’ve always known that Gaby and Shelly are the closest. They have a really sweet friendship.
 
Shelly is getting married. Gaby is the maid of honor and I’m one of the bridesmaids. Over the weekend, I went with Shelly so she could look at wedding dresses. Gaby was supposed to come with us but got called into work last minute. I helped Shelly pick out some dresses then she went with the consultant to try them on. Shelly asked that I take pictures and videos on her phone to send to her mom and Gaby. I was getting the camera ready when a text from Gaby came through. I didn’t mean to click on it and was instantly going to click back out when I saw one of my Instagram pictures in their private chat from earlier that morning. Both were making fun of me for the face I was making and my outfit choice. It didn’t appear to be very good nature.
 
I admit, curiosity got the best of me so I searched my name in the chat. I found multiple pictures that I, my boyfriend or my mom have posted of myself, absolutely ripping them to shreds. Ranging from selfies to posed shots to even a few baby pictures. They’d also make fun of me in general in terms of the way I talked, wore my hair and the way I ate. This went back as far as I could tell, at least a year.
 
My heart broke. It all felt so juvenile and high school. While we all joke around, I would never do this to them nor have they ever even tried to instigate these types of conversations with me about the other one on one. I was in tears. As someone who was bullied all through middle and high school, it just brought me back to a horrible place. I put the phone in Shelly’s purse and brought it to another employee, telling her to tell Shelly that I had to go. I drove home and had a long cry.
 
Shelly texted me by the time I made it home asking where I went. I said I was going home and we could talk later. When she did call a few hours later, she was understandably confused and hurt that I left. I told her what I found, explaining that I only looked further because of the initial text I accidentally saw. She went off on me for looking through her private texts and said those were none of my business. She also told me I shouldn’t have left the store without saying anything. I said I didn’t want to make a scene but also knew I couldn’t fake being happy for her.
 
Shelly told me the texts were “all in good fun” and clearly she loves me because I’m going to be her bridesmaid. She added that I’m only hurt because I chose to read all those texts. Later on, Gaby called to tell me that I invaded Shelly’s privacy and hurt her by walking out.
 
My boyfriend and mom think I did the right thing by walking out. But obviously, they’re a little biased. I just want some unbiased looks: was I an asshole to look through the texts and then leave?

178,1cvfosl,AITA for Challenging My Stepmother’s Lack of Forgiveness?,"I (47M) have a complicated relationship with my stepmother (68F). She has been significant in my life since I was 10, and while I appreciate the role she played in my early years, our relationship has become increasingly strained. She nurtures grievances and brings them up repeatedly; believes her memory is infallible, but her stories change over time, generally to my detriment. My father (73M) enables her and won’t stand up for me.

**Trigger:**

Mother's Day this year was challenging. I had flown into NZ from Melbourne early Sunday morning to join my partner (43F) and her family to celebrate her grandmother’s 90th birthday. The day was hectic and stressful. By the time I woke up, my partner and her daughter (11) had finished their Mother’s Day activities. We were rushing to pack the car with my belongings and leave. My partner’s daughter had extended meltdowns during the 7-hour drive home. With everything going on, I forgot about Mother's day and did not call my stepmother (or my mother).

**The Argument:**

A few days later, I called my Dad to prepare for our regular video call with my Dad, stepmother, and sister. He mentioned that my stepmother was out and told me to call back later. I suggested I just video chat with him and my sister at that time, but he hesitated, eventually firming his mind and telling me to call later when my stepmother was home because she wanted to check something with me.

I called them a few hours later while I was driving. During the call, when I asked about how my stepmother was, she launched a passive-aggressive attack, saying, “How do you think I feel?” It took me a few moments to work out that she assumed I had been around Mother’s Day celebrations in New Zealand and ignored her in Australia. My stepmother then brought up a supposedly forgotten birthday from over ten years ago, recounting details that I have no knowledge of.

In a moment of frustration, I challenged her Christian beliefs by pointing out that she wasn’t being very forgiving. Seriously, I had tried to apologise, but it felt like I had to relive all of her hurt in this process. I’m not particularly proud of this, but I was furious and lashed out during this attack.

>**After the call, I responded to my Dad’s text:** *Ok to phone now*.  
I don't think it was ok to phone, Dad. I know it's not your fault that I forgot Mother's Day, but that was an ambush.

>*No. Not ambush. You need to be able to discuss the impact of your action/inaction on those who love you. You hurt her!*

>I spoke to you this afternoon, and you gave me no indication of this. That was an ambush, and I found it very hurtful also. Maybe you didn't mean it, but that's how it feels.

**TLDR**

My stepmother was hurt by me not calling on Mother’s Day. I feel she used the situation to attack me without any empathy. Her rehashing of past grievances makes it hard to move forward. In a moment of frustration, I pointed out her lack of forgiveness isn’t Christian. AITA?",Asshole,2024-05-19,"AITA for Challenging My Stepmother’s Lack of Forgiveness? I (47M) have a complicated relationship with my stepmother (68F). She has been significant in my life since I was 10, and while I appreciate the role she played in my early years, our relationship has become increasingly strained. She nurtures grievances and brings them up repeatedly; believes her memory is infallible, but her stories change over time, generally to my detriment. My father (73M) enables her and won’t stand up for me.

**Trigger:**

Mother's Day this year was challenging. I had flown into NZ from Melbourne early Sunday morning to join my partner (43F) and her family to celebrate her grandmother’s 90th birthday. The day was hectic and stressful. By the time I woke up, my partner and her daughter (11) had finished their Mother’s Day activities. We were rushing to pack the car with my belongings and leave. My partner’s daughter had extended meltdowns during the 7-hour drive home. With everything going on, I forgot about Mother's day and did not call my stepmother (or my mother).

179,1cvf4yi,AITA for wanting to put a Lock box over my thermostat to keep my roommate from changing the temp?,"So, I (23 F) live in a shared 4-bedroom apartment while going to college full time with 3 other girls living with me, also college students, complete strangers before moving in. The first year everything was relatively okay with all of us. We didn't talk much unless we saw one another in the common rooms, (mainly the kitchen) and we all didn't really interact much at least on my part. Until the second year, me and two of my roommates had a falling out because of cleaning issues around the apartment. Basically, we don't see eye to eye on the way things are left in the apartment, so we don't talk really at all unless something is broken in the apartment and they need me to fix it or call maintenance because I'm the one who always does it.

Recently it has begun to get hotter in the place we live, and I turn the thermostat to cold and monitor it and remember to turn it off to be easy on our utilities. But one of my roommates (we'll say her name is Lisa) has been turning the temperature on heat when it is over 80-90 degrees outside. Me and even my other roommate I don't really get along with (we'll call her Rayne) asked politely in the group chat to not do that during the hot temperature season. She did not respond in the group chat at all to our questions. A few weeks have gone by, and Lisa still turns the thermostat to heat leaving our apartment to become humid the longer it stays on not to mention we live on the second floor and heat rises from the ground up through our apartment. I'm tired of coming home after a long day of school or one of my 2 part time jobs just to be hotter and turn on the AC just to have Lisa turn the heat back on a few minutes later.

I have even asked Lisa TWICE in a private text that we had asked her to stop, and if she wanted to talk to me face to face about it since we have mostly ever talked over text. Still no response, I feel that she is being the childish person in this situation not talking to me, or the rest of the roommates to establish a compromise on ANYTHING. And due to Lisa and I's fallout I fell that she does it on purpose to make me mad.

So, I went and bought a thermostat lockbox to put over the thermostat that only I have the keys to, and I am planning to install it when she's not here so she can't say I didn't try to talk to her. If she or my other roommate Rayne or both go to management about it, I will simply say that I have asked Lisa to stop putting the air on heat when it is hot outside, that I have reached out to her multiple times, and she has not responded, and that I am managing the amount of usage that goes to our utilities that we all have to split and pay for.

 Am I establishing a boundary that keeps getting crossed by one person making everyone else miserable, or am I taking away someone's rights to a commodity they are entitled to? I feel like I am doing this not just for my sake, but for my other two roommates who are also annoyed by her antics.

 A couple weeks ago, she invited me to a small family gathering she was having to welcome her aunt who was visiting from Ecuador. 
 Now usually I enjoy food from different countries and have no problem trying new foods. Usually.
So last weekend i went to her small party along with my 6 year old. Everyone was very sweet like always and were especially excited for the meal. When i asked what was the dish they were waiting on, they said it was ""cuy"". I had never heard of it so I said I was excited to try it.
 When they finally brought out their special dish, i was shocked to see that it was roasted guinea pigs. I went green in the face. I tried to hide my disgust and tried not to let anyone see how surprised I was, but I'm not sure I did a good job of it.   
 I served myself and my child rice and other foods, but did not touch the cuy. When people noticed i was not partaking of the guinea pigs, they explained to me how it was a delicacy in Ecuador,  and that if I eat chicken and pig, then I shouldn't think of guinea pigs being any different.  I said i agreed with that statement but I'd just rather not try it. The people sitting next to me seemed annoyed but didn't push me to try.
 When my coworker came to check on me, she was disappointed that i wouldn't try it. But she got angry when i didn't allow her to serve my 6 year old a piece of her cuy. At that point i decided my child and i should leave. I thanked her for the invitation and said goodbye to the aunt and other people i knew.
 The next day at work, she confronted me about my lack of manners. She said i was an a-hole for not giving her cuisine a try, and an even bigger a-hole for not even letting my child try it.

185,1cvenvg,AITA for refusing a request from my dad while still living at his house?,"This conflict between my dad and I (21M) has been going on for around 7 years. I will try to keep this from getting too long while still keeping it as unbiased as I can.

Me and my dad have never really gotten along, he wasn't abusive or anything but he used to have unpredictable mood swings and when he got angry at someone he would scream at everyone and I usually ended up grounded, so I did my best to avoid him (mostly by just trying to stay out of his sight as much as possible). After a bit he noticed and he told me that he wanted me to talk more. I didn't take his request seriously which led to him grounding me in my room.

A few weeks after he initially grounded me, my dad tries to talk it out. He pulls the whole family to the living room and asks me what my problem was. I told him I didn't know (out of cowardice), and after that my dad started claiming I had him in a cold war. He then tried having my mom ask me the same question and I gave the same answer (this time I was just trying to get out of it) which led to him now claiming I had both him and my mom in a cold war. To be fair I did admit to keeping information from him once. To make matters worse, a while later (not sure how long) my dad pulls me and my brothers to a room to talk about a unrelated situation. He was trying to make a example using pillows and asked me to say a female name for one of the pillows and I said no. The reason I said no was because I though I was gonna get teased if I did but I didn't tell this to my dad. Since I just said no without explaining, my dad took it as a act of rebellion and assumed the reason I wasn't talking more like he asked was also because of rebellion.

After these incidents my dad tried talking it out countless time but I always game him the same answer (""I don't know""). Honestly the reason I never tried to talk things out was a mix of pride, resentment and lack of bravery. Eventually (maybe a couple years or so later) I did start giving answers, but by then he didn't believe a word I said and would either cut me off while talking or simply ignore anything I said. At this point we both have lost interest in talking it out and mostly avoid each other. Me being grounded in the room has also become permanent and he says he wont let me out until I do as he says. He also says that since I can't solve what he claims is a simple issue with a quick fix, he can't trust me with a car (which means he hasn't let me get a driver license) nor can he trust me with a job (which means he is only letting me study what my brothers study and says he wont let me work unless I work at the same place as them) and he only lets me help around the house with menial tasks.

After these incidents my dad tried talking it out countless time but I always game him the same answer (""I don't know""). Honestly the reason I never tried to talk things out was a mix of pride, resentment and lack of bravery. Eventually (maybe a couple years or so later) I did start giving answers, but by then he didn't believe a word I said and would either cut me off while talking or simply ignore anything I said. At this point we both have lost interest in talking it out and mostly avoid each other. Me being grounded in the room has also become permanent and he says he wont let me out until I do as he says. He also says that since I can't solve what he claims is a simple issue with a quick fix, he can't trust me with a car (which means he hasn't let me get a driver license) nor can he trust me with a job (which means he is only letting me study what my brothers study and says he wont let me work unless I work at the same place as them) and he only lets me help around the house with menial tasks. To be fair I have always been slow compared to my brothers, so much so that most people that know me think there is a problem with me (although this has never been checked)
