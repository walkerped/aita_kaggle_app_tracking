0,1cwlo0l,AITA for not trusting my mother?,"I am a 18 year old, she is 59.

For context, I suffer from depression since some years ago already so I wasnt the happiest to begin with but now I also got gender dysphoria which is making me feel so empty and joyless. It seems like a edgy angsty teen thing but trust me when I say it really is a huge problem for me and I dont say it to sound cool, in fact I wish I wasnt sad like this.

We were privately talking and she asked me why is it that im always unhappy/irritated/angry and that she would love to see me laugh just a little bit. I replied that its not something she can fix and that only I can do it since after all, it depends on me to fix my own gender dysphoria and come to terms with who I am.

Then she told me that it is ok to think like that but that I should live in the moment and try to enjoy the current state of my life a bit more instead of thinking about the future since that will make me much happier.

I said that I completely agree with her and I do want to think like that but I just feel so genuinely unhappy about my life. I told her that im really trying to make a change but its so hard when the feelings are this harsh, pessimistic and strong. I also said that im genuinely sorry since I know it hurts her but I dont want to fake a smile around my own mother just to give her the ilusion im improving. It makes me sad that she has to tolerate me along with her already ongoing issues in her life. 

She remarked that she also has her bad habits I have to tolerate. I responded in agreement but also said that ""I do have to tolerate your moments because its your house we are living in, after all""

Then she replied ""or else what am I going to do get you out of the house? (said sarcastically)""

Here is where things turn sour, I did not deny that possibility. Which really bothered her, I tried to ""justify"" it by saying that If I depend on other people to have basic care needs met then I may lose those people because they will reject me for being trans when I tell them and I will lose that basic care (I didnt tell her like that directly, like the reject me for being trans thing but that was what I was referring to). I told her that it is very hard for me to trust anyone.

She said that she truly was dissapointed that I just see her as any other person, as a part of ""anyone"" if you know what I mean. I realized that I hurt her feelings so I told her to not take it personally since its like that with everyone. She got hurt by that too since I just lumped her in with everyone else.

After that I tried to apologize but I ended up leaving since it was no use.

1,1cwlctn,UPDATE on spending my son's university fund on a trip to Europe to drink beer with monks.,"Hi everyone. We are on our way to the airport and on our way to Barcelona. We will be going to be in Europe for a month. The visit to the monks at Westvleteren will be the last part of our trip. Two reasons. I don't want to lug beer bottles all over Spain, France, Belgium and Holland. Also I am putting it off for as long as I can. 

For those of you that asked my son's name is Ryan. He was an amazing kid. I don't know if he got his love of the microscopic world from me. I did teach him how to make his own sourdough starter and I will be keeping his alive to make loaves and waffles with. His ashes are in our yard, on Mount Tremblant, on the shores of the St. Lawrence and I will be taking some to Belgium. My grandfathers have many friends buried there and I think they would approve. 

I thank everyone that offered to buy me a beer. And while I appreciate the offer I'm pretty sure my liver, and my wife, would not have been happy with me. I will be with the monks on the week of June 23rd. If you would like to join me in a toast with your favorite drink of choice I would love that more. I love knowing that people all around the world know about my son and he would love knowing he was toasted in such a manner. 

I spoke with my wife, my ex wife, her husband, and his son. I invited them to join us, at my expense, for the last week of my trip. My wife's stepson was friends with my son. I didn't know how close until we spoke. They are gaming buddies. They spoke almost every day playing online. He gave me a picture of my son I did not have. It is a picture of the two of them age about 14/15 at my ex wife's wedding to his father. My son looked great in his suit. I cried. He did too. We had a very awkward but heartfelt man hug. Then we laughed. They will be coming to say goodbye with us. 

After talking to my accountant and my lawyer I was told that I could not have transferred him the value of the RESP. I have decided, after talking to my wife, that we are going to give him enough money to cover one year of tuition. Even after my trip we will have money left over. I'm trying to do some good with it. I also said that he could call us any time he needed since he will be attending school close to us. So funny he got accepted here and my son was accepted there. 

I want to thank everyone who shared their condolences with me. I want to especially thank everyone that helped me plan my visit to Belgium. I know we won't see each other but you were invaluable.

2,1cwjhk8,UPDATE - AITA for Not Sticking Up for My Brother After My Boyfriend Called Him Out?,"Hi  again everyone,

I wanted to write a quick update now that Sunday is over. Original Post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cumoi4/aita_for_not_sticking_up_for_my_brother_after_my/)

I ended up talking to my Aunt Amy and Uncle Joe last night when I went over for dinner as I mentioned. They have always been a safe haven for me, and it was really comforting to hear their perspective. Amy and Joe told me that my parents have always been wrong in how they treated me and that the way they let Tom belittle me is not okay. They said that whenever they tried to stand up for me, my parents would not let them see me and Tom.

One instance they brought up really hit home for me. I remember not getting to see Aunt Amy and Uncle Joe for a few months after my mom and Amy got into an argument. This happened after Tom ruined some of my favorite books, and Aunt Amy tried to defend me. She told my mom that it wasn't fair for Tom to face no consequences and that I deserved better. My mom got so furious at Amy's interference that she decided to cut off contact for a while. I think I was 7, I didn't fully understand why I suddenly couldn't visit them anymore, but I remember being upset and even more isolated.

Joe explained that this is why they always tried to take me on outings whenever they could. It was their way of giving me a break from the environment at home. It hit just seemed to hit me all at once while we were talking. They’re the ones who took me to the zoo, a movie, or just a walk in the park, all my happy memories as a kid were never with my parents. Honestly, they’re who I think of when I think of what a parent should be.

After our talk, I've decided to go no contact with my parents and Tom for the time being. I need to focus on what I want and what’s good for me. My aunt and uncle also promised they’d run interference for me so I don’t have to deal with them.

Also, Alex proposed to me yesterday morning. I honestly didn’t expect it, but I’m so happy. We’re going to be visiting his family over the long weekend to celebrate and my aunt and uncle are going to go with us. I don’t know what’s going to come of cutting my parents and brother out but I’m glad I’m doing it.

3,1cwgzxm,AITA for going behind the bride's back for a wedding?,"I, 23M have this friend, Joseph, 26M, who I met in a group home. I had a pretty rough childhood and he took care of me in the home, which can be not so great if you're one of the youngest. Anyway. We became close pretty much immediately and as we grew up we became best mates. I recently graduated, and he was there, I helped him get a job, etc.

His future wife Amy doesn't like me. I have no idea why, its not even a mutual feeling. I brought it up to Joseph once but he dismissed it saying she has no reason to dislike me. I know, thats part of why I'm confused.

Anyway, Joseph is getting married, I'm his best man which Amy is unhappy about. This is probably the time to mention that Joseph is South Asian and Amy is White so they're having a mix of cultures at the wedding. As a member of the groom's half I've got to wear something South Asian. So I picked out this red kurta set. Amy didn't like it because she thought red would look too bridal.

I'm a guy so I was confused but desi brides do traditionally wear red (she's wearing white though) so fair enough. I then picked out a blue one, she said the blue was too bright, I then picked a green one, she said it didn't go with the theme. I was starting to get the feeling she was doing this on purpose (since she suggested no alternatives) and just wanted to keep me out of the wedding. So instead of asking her about it, for the next one I just went straight to Joseph for approval, he okayed it pretty much instantly, a cream kurta which matched some of the other's on his side.

Amy saw me in it for the first time yesterday and started screaming. I couldn't make out much of what she was saying since it was a lot of borderline screeching, but roughly I think she thought it was too similar to white. She called me a lot of swears, which I will not repeat and an a-hole for going behind her back. But it's Josephs's wedding too. Its not like I just chose it on my own.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cukek4/aita_for_never_telling_my_mother_i_married_into/

I got some really good feedback from my post and it led to my Husband and I staying up most of the night discussing what we wanted to do and a decision was reached. It wasn't an easy one but we have a child to think of now and she has to come first.

We blocked my Mother on every social Media, we changed our phone numbers and we reached out to the family lawyer to get in contact with her to inform her that all visits have been stopped after how she spoke to me in front of my sister. She has to get clean for at least a year with weekly tests if she wants to see my sister again. My Mother can contact our family lawyer if she needs help with the tests but beyond that she gets no help from us unless she wants to go to rehab which we will pay for, directly to the rehab not her. 

My Husband, Sister and I have also moved in with my In-Laws for the time being as my Mother knows where we live. We will be looking for a new place and my In-Laws are aware of the situation and that we are cutting all contact for now. Honestly my In-Laws are delighted to have us staying with them, when we arrived the guest room my sister is using for now had an army of Squishmallows on the bed they are her current obsession and my FIL makes sure to bring a new one each time he sees her I always think she must have them all now and each time i'm wrong, how he keeps track of what she has and doesn't have I don't know as he never buys doubles. 

We are settling in well, we are even planning a small Holiday with just my Husband, sister and I to get away from the stress we've been under, nowhere abroad as she doesn't have a passport yet but we'll be fixing that soon as we want to take her to Lapland for Christmas.

All in all we're doing alright though I admit I am feeling very conflicted and guilty over this even though I know it's the right choice it just doesn't make it easy.

Title. I'm going to college in August, and instead of getting a dorm room, i'm getting an apartment with 2 other roommates (each with their own room) near the university. I'm getting there like 4 days before all of the introductory activities start, so i can get settled. However, my parents want to stay a whooping 10 DAYS living in my apartment, in a air mattress, in my room. This just seems crazy to me.

This is such an inconvenience because 
1- I'd have to share a room with them for a whole 10 days
2- I would probably make my roommates uncomfortable with my parents being in the apartment for 10 days
3- I would literally start classes while they would still be in my apartment.

I feel like such a bad person telling them they should go home sooner, but i just feel like this is such a invasion of my privacy.

7,1cw5j85,AITA for telling my step daughter that she needs to causing drama and to grow up?,"For context I (60 yrs old) raised my step daughter (21 yrs old) since she was 11 and have been married to her mom (60 yrs old)  for 5 yrs. I know that my stepdaughter doesn’t have the best relationship with her bio dad & doesn’t like to talk about him much. But anyway she was telling me and her mom this morning that her friends have never seen a pic of her dad & that she decided to post a pic of her and her dad on her Instagram account yesterday.

I felt kind of off about it because I don’t want her to post anything that’s gonna start something since everyone thinks I’m her biological father. But we all go to church and my step daughter’s friends have heard about her dad but never seen a photo of him and she felt that it was time for them to see.

Anyway back to the story, I told my stepdaughter that she shouldn’t have posted the picture of her and her dad because it’s gonna stir conflict and that she’s gonna start nothing but drama. She tried telling me that it doesn’t matter because that’s still her dad and she still loves him. I tried to tell her that not everyone needs to know all the stuff that goes on between her and her dad. She said she wasn’t gonna tell anyone about their estranged relationship, that she just wanted to post a picture. But I think otherwise.

She tried telling me “it’s literally my dad. Why is that such a problem to you? I don’t see you getting so defensive when I post pictures of me and you? Why can’t you just understand that? What is so hard about this?? The church isn’t going to judge. At least I post about you online, I don’t ever see your 4 bio kids posting about you at all. They don’t even want to talk to you!!”

I got in self defense mode and told her “that’s different and you KNOW that. You seriously need to stop causing all this drama. You need to GROW UP! Maybe this is why you don’t have a lot of friends because you run your mouth too much and try to start something stupid every single time. It’s pathetic that you’re almost 22 yrs old and still act like a freaking child. Grow up man and go get a stupid job. I’m so tired of this.

There’s no way she’s gonna talk about my 4 kids like that and butt in like that. So I told her off and said that I said and walked out the door to my back yard to cool off. When I came back inside I could see that she had been crying and noticed tissues in the trash can.

Edit: the reason why people think I’m her bio dad at church [or anywhere] is because her dad is white, meanwhile me and her mom are full blooded Hispanic. My step daughter carries heavy genes for looking Hispanic. So people naturally think I’m her father.",Asshole,2024-05-20,"AITA for telling my step daughter that she needs to causing drama and to grow up? For context I (60 yrs old) raised my step daughter (21 yrs old) since she was 11 and have been married to her mom (60 yrs old)  for 5 yrs. I know that my stepdaughter doesn’t have the best relationship with her bio dad & doesn’t like to talk about him much. But anyway she was telling me and her mom this morning that her friends have never seen a pic of her dad & that she decided to post a pic of her and her dad on her Instagram account yesterday.

I felt kind of off about it because I don’t want her to post anything that’s gonna start something since everyone thinks I’m her biological father. But we all go to church and my step daughter’s friends have heard about her dad but never seen a photo of him and she felt that it was time for them to see.

Anyway back to the story, I told my stepdaughter that she shouldn’t have posted the picture of her and her dad because it’s gonna stir conflict and that she’s gonna start nothing but drama. She tried telling me that it doesn’t matter because that’s still her dad and she still loves him. I tried to tell her that not everyone needs to know all the stuff that goes on between her and her dad. She said she wasn’t gonna tell anyone about their estranged relationship, that she just wanted to post a picture. But I think otherwise.

She tried telling me “it’s literally my dad. Why is that such a problem to you? I don’t see you getting so defensive when I post pictures of me and you? Why can’t you just understand that? What is so hard about this?? The church isn’t going to judge. At least I post about you online, I don’t ever see your 4 bio kids posting about you at all. They don’t even want to talk to you!!”

I got in self defense mode and told her “that’s different and you KNOW that. You seriously need to stop causing all this drama. You need to GROW UP! Maybe this is why you don’t have a lot of friends because you run your mouth too much and try to start something stupid every single time. It’s pathetic that you’re almost 22 yrs old and still act like a freaking child. Grow up man and go get a stupid job. I’m so tired of this.

9,1cw5ijj,WIBTA for setting boundaries after a Mother’s Day fight?,"I (29M) posted here after a fight on Mother’s Day with my mom (47F) that opened my eyes a lot. TL;DR, we got into an explosive screaming match over the phone over some MASSIVE misinterpretations on her end, and suddenly my mom said everything from “well why don’t you go tell your step-mother?!” to “you have no idea what I’m dealing with right now! You’re not the only one with problems!” I don’t want to repost that mess here if I can avoid it, but rest assured I got the hint and now need your help because this all stemmed from a Facebook post from Mother’s Day ten years ago when I was basically saying my good-byes in a very, very dark time of my life. The post was deleted a week ago, but the fight is still in my mind.

Emotional blackmail like this is my mother’s go-to (has been since I was a kid) and until seeing you all post it here in black and white, I just thought this was normal stuff parents did. Everyone has a complicated relationship with family, right? But seeing SO many of you tell me how toxic this was made me realize what nearly 14 years of therapy with five different professionals couldn’t: that I’m just never going to be able to just live with it. I have been told so many times to cut her out of my life by going on a hundred different people at this point. I even briefly did about ten years ago. And each time I came back because I thought this time was going to be different, because something would change for a couple of months max before slipping back.

I have been told everything from “you’re nothing without me,” to “you only want me around for money,” to her favorite, “you know, I didn’t HAVE to give birth to you” (paraphrasing tremendously to comply with rules) since I was eight, at least. After a week of thinking, I talked to my husband (28M) about setting some boundaries, and these are the big two we came up with:

- No more money, ever, unless we’re about to lose our house. Christmas/Birthday/holiday gifts have a hard limit of $25 and if they’re a cent more, they aren’t accepted. If we go out to eat, my husband and I pay for ourselves. No exceptions.
- We start saving to pay her back the $5k she “gifted” us for our down payment fro the house, which I’m now thinking was actually just another loan. Any other additional “gifts” like that are rejected, and any other money we do accept from here on out is eventually paid back.

I am worried these might come off as TA-ish and as overreactions, but to keep myself out of more depressive spirals, I have to know if I’m doing the right thing. Even if I’m TA, I need to know if there’s room for nuance in that. She’s coming up next week for Memorial Day brunch, and I need outsider insight.

I would find myself sleeping on piles of their clothes or having to share room with my family members bc too many things around. It messed me up mentally and as a kid I even tried running away from home. It created a great amount of trauma for me that till this day I still resent both my parents for.
My parents decided to finally take things out of my room as a way to “compromise. Yet my place never stopped looking like someone’s junkyard.

It has been like this since I was 12 and I’ve learned to accept that they won’t change. I have not moved out due to the convenience of not having to pay extra for rent, since Im paying for my masters and also saving up to buy a house.

However, out of nowhere, 2 weeks ago or so, my parents mentioned to me that my uncle, aunt, and 2 children are moving in with us. I was in complete shock as there is absolutely NO space for them. I immediately told them how much of an invasion of privacy this is, but my parents said this is their decision. 
So now they’re here and it’s been difficult to be here with so many people. I can only imagine how it would be once I go back in school and get home late wanting to sleep. There is no space in my apartment and I feel extremely anxious. 
As I’m an adult, my only option here is to move out. I have expressed my annoyance to my parents about the fact that they couldn’t tell me about them moving in with us in advance, to give me the time to find a new space. Their response to that was that they have to give me no explanation, That I could move out as I’m an adult. As I know they are right, that is exactly what I’ll be doing. 

The problem is my partner of 4 years and I planned to buy a house within the next year. We have been saving for a while for this goal.

 However I feel myself being triggered here and I need to get out asap. I tried explaining to my partner the need for us to move out sooner than expect and at least am option of.

So as I see things, My timing is just not at his timing even mentally I don’t know how he can live with someone who verbally abuses him everyday at his place, and I need to do what is best for me mentally even if it is stressing myself out to cover rent on my own.

11,1cw5hum,"AITA for ""spying"" on my best friend's wife?","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Just to clarify, I didn't actually spy on anyone, all I did was keep tabs on her for the sake of my friend.

I (M32) have a close friend (M25) who I've gotten very close with over the past few years. Lately I'd noticed that he's been more stressed than usual, he's very much a career man so it's not like being exhausted or overworked is something new, but when we hung out he was talking less and generally just seemed uncomfortable, which definitely is out of the ordinary. After a bit of prying, I got him to admit that he has a hunch his wife might be cheating on him. According to him, she's been distant lately, and she's started going out with her ""girl friends"" multiple times a week, even though she never used to go out that much. Recently my buddy got a big promotion at his job which has forced him to put in a lot more hours, and apparently this has been putting a strain on their marriage, with them fighting more, being distant, etc.

Here's where things get complicated. Since my friend works so many hours, he doesn't really have any way or confirming or denying his suspicions. His wife says she's been visiting a friend's place, and that friend actually lives just a couple blocks from where I do. I was a bit confused about why he mentioned this detail, but after some thinking I realized maybe he was trying to ask me to check it out and see? I don't know. Clearly this topic was hard for him to talk about, and I didn't want to interrogate him to find out what he meant. I know it might sound like a reach, but what harm would I really be doing by just hanging around the area to see?

So, for the next week or so, on the way home from work I would stop and hang around outside her friend's house for half an hour or so, right around when she apparently goes to visit. Over the course of the week, I saw my friend's wife visit twice, and I took note of which days / times. I figured I'd keep tabs on my own, and then try to compare with my friend the next time we spoke. My plan was working pretty great, until my own girlfriend (F27) started wondering why I was coming home later. I'm really not comfortable with lying to her, so I fessed about what I was doing. To my surprise, this really upset her, apparently she thinks I'm spying on a woman and being a ""total creep"", and that my friend would be pissed if he knew what I was doing. I've know my friend a LOT longer than my gf, and I know that he would appreciate what I'm doing. Nonetheless, she's given me an ultimatum, and says if I don't stop now she'll tell him and his wife.

I really don't think I've overstepped, I haven't caused any harm and am just looking out for someone who's been there for me when I needed him.

12,1cw5bow,AITA for raising the temp in my apartment? ,"I live with my roomate in a fairly large apt w/ 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. Heat and AC is apart of our rent cost, and does not fluxiate per unit. My room is next to the a/c and has a vent while my roomate's is on the opposite side and does not have a vent. I typically like the apartment between 68-72F.

Now that it's getting warmer my roomate and her boyf have been waiting until I go to sleep to lower the temperature from anywhere between 58-65 F. I've asked both of them repeatedly to stop doing this. I did say if it's really hot to and they want to lower it to, 65/66 that could be okay but anything lower than that is to cold for me. My roomate said that's not fair since she don't have a vent, the apt needs to be colder so air can go into her room.

I have suggested leaving the door open, she said no. Then I offered both my fan and air purfier (which has a fan) for them to use. She said that she hate fans, that they dry out her eyes and mouth. So, then I offered my humidifer that way she wouldn't get too dry but she said no to all of it. Please keep in mind I'm not using any of these things atm and wear sweatpants, a sweatshirt, use a comfoter and multiple blankets when I go to sleep.

Since this has not stopped, I've been getting sick, I wake up freezing with a runnny nose and sore throat constantly. While I understand it sucks to be too hot, I thought I offered them enough solutions to try fix this problem.

Before I went to bed tonight I realizsed how cold it was, and saeit was set to 64. I pointed this out and she said her room was too hot. I offered up my fans again and and suggessted her to leave her door open so the air could go into her room and remined her I was sick. She of course said no to fans and door but finally said fine in after me begging to raise it to 68. My roomate sounds pissed at me though and has been extremely passive aggressive about this issue.

She of course said no to fans and door but finally said fine in after me begging to raise it to 68. My roomate sounds pissed at me though and has been extremely passive aggressive about this issue.

TBH i am the the worst when i feel slighting hot/uncomfy so i understand that, but AITA for insisting that we raise the temp?

One day, my sister (22F) came home from college to have dinner with us. I had left a plastic bag with the bread inside on the kitchen counter to take to school in the morning. I was upstairs and when i came down to eat dinner, i walked into the kitchen to see my bread gone. I asked my mom what happened to it and she said my sister ate it. I got quite pissed because I only had four pieces left and it was supposed to last me most of the school week. Then when we sat down for dinner, I confronted her and asked why she ate my bread. She said because she wanted to try it. I asked why she didn’t ask and she told me she didn’t care. I asked “what the hell is wrong with you” and my mom got mad at me and told me i was making the dinner unpleasant. 

I was in a bad mood that whole night and to make things worse, she went upstairs right after dinner and left me to do everyone’s dishes. I asked my mom why she couldn’t help and she said that my sister had a long day of school. The next day, i came into the kitchen and noticed on one of the counters was a plastic bag with my bread in it, half eaten. She didn’t even finish the bread.

14,1cw556g,AITA for talking in my own room?,"I [23M] recently decided to resume my university studies. I ended up returning to school for winter quarter, and as such, typical on-campus housing arrangements were mostly unavailable. I had some savings from the job I worked over COVID and I enjoy working and playing video games late at night so I thought I would try to find a living arrangement where I at least had a single room to myself in order to avoid disturbing other people who prefer to sleep earlier.

Availability for even off-campus housing was low mid-year so the best choice ended up being a long-term AirBnB. The cost (2000 USD/month) is very high for what is a very small single room in a house with housemates.

Before moving in, landlord 'Christopher' [M60s-70s] sent an email abt rules for living in his house. Regarding noise, the only guideline included was ""Please remember that I live in a quiet neighborhood and be respectful of my neighbors especially when in pool area as well as in the evenings."" This seemed like a reasonable level of noise/quietness to expect from tenants; I read it as 'don't throw parties that will make the neighbors call in a noise complaint.'
 
This turned out to be a significant under-representation of the level of quietude that would be expected. Upon moving in I found that one of the long-term housemates was the landlord's daughter 'Christina' [F30s-40s], who lived in an adjacent room to mine. Christina is a very light sleeper who sleeps from about 9:30 pm to 5 am. Christina is such a light sleeper that she will be woken up if I talk at normal conversational volume in my room at times past her bedtime.

I decided to try and accommodate these constraints. As such, past 9:30 I would attempt to only whisper into my headset microphone while playing video games with my friends online, etc.

This strategy seemed to mostly work. However, very occasionally over the last 5.5 months of my stay, I would forget and speak at normal conversational volume for brief periods after Christina's bedtime, which would wake her up. So far, over the last 5.5 months, this has happened 4 times.

Christopher and Christina are very unforgiving regarding 'quiet hours.' This most recent time it happened, two days ago, Christina claimed it had been an issue '5-10' times and Christopher had said he would charge me 100 USD for each subsequent violation of the 'house rules' (I know this is unenforceable). They think it's extremely unusual that anyone would be awake at any time past midnight. They claim I have a 'special schedule' due to sleeping from 2-9 am that I should make the fact that I have this 'special schedule' very explicitly clear when searching for future living arrangements.

AITA for talking at normal conversational volume in my room at all past ~9:30pm, let alone only 4 times over the duration of my lease?

16,1cw4tm7,AITA for expecting my partner to read labels?,"Background: I (36 F) recently reorganized a closet with extra bedding supplies. On one shelf: two large zippered bins with clear front windows holding blankets. On the shelf above: smaller boxes with various bedding. Each of the smaller boxes is labeled on the front with what is inside.

After I got home from work this evening my partner (38 M) told me that he couldn’t find a pillowcase. He then said “instead of searching for it, I decided to wait until I could ask you” like it was an extremely thoughtful gesture. I told him it would be in the box labeled “pillowcases” to which he said “I didn’t see anything labeled.” We verified we were discussing the same closet. Frustrated, I lead him upstairs and pointed out the labels and he said, “I was only looking at the lower shelves and there aren’t labels there. Also it was dark so I wouldn’t have been able to see the labels.”

At this point I’m very frustrated. I ask him how he can say that he looked for something if he didn’t actually look. He says he never would’ve expected to see labels like that and his whole life he’s just dug around until he found what he was looking for. He then goes on that he knew I’d worked hard to organize this so he didn’t want to mess it all up by looking through everything to find what he was looking for.

At this point I’ve made it clear that I’m really annoyed. I tell him it’s frustrating that i basically dummy-proofed it and he still can’t find it. He says he doesn’t want to keep talking about it. I told him I never wanted to talk about it, that’s why I’d labeled all of the boxes. 

Then he starts talking about how impossible it is to know what’s going to make me mad. He said he knew if he’d taken all of the boxes down to look through them, I’d be mad. So he decided to wait and just ask me where it would be, but I’m still mad. He says that no matter what, I’m always just going to be mad.

I tried explaining that there were other options, like he turned on a light and used his eyes to read the labels, or, after I stated they were in a box labeled pillowcases, he went and checked the closet again before stating he didn’t see anything labeled.

He keeps telling me I’m acting like he’s done something wrong and I tell him I think he has. Then he tells me that I “clearly don’t understand” and explains again that he was doing a nice thing by not just pulling everything down and waiting to ask me where things are. I’ve asked him to go explain this situation to any woman that he knows and see what they say. He won’t.

I feel like he didn’t actually try and then waited to get me to do it for him but is trying to tell me I should be appreciative of this extra work he’s bestowed upon me.

He says he thinks he was doing a nice thing by not messing up the organized closet and that I’m being mean for insinuating that he’s “a dummy.” He says he now doesn’t feel safe asking me questions because I’ll  make him feel stupid.

17,1cw4tj6,AITA for telling off one of my friends for completely blowing things out of proportion with another friend?,"So, I've been friends with this girl. (I'll call her callie). Callie has a habit of making herself a victim, in like, everything.

So one day, I was hanging out with my other friend (I'll call her Sarah), when Callie had come along. We didn't mind it, and we were just chatting like usual, when Callie mentioned that her mom wasn't allowing her to a concert anymore. Sarah and Callie were supposed to go together before.

Honestly, I didn't believe Callie one bit, because she's been pushing Sarah and I away lately for her new gf, (I'll call her Ellie). Ellie is a bad person, and did horrible things to Sarah back when they used to be friends. Obviously that bothered Sarah and I, but we can't choose who Callie dates, so we just usually avoid the topic.

Anyways, a while later, Callie had to go home, when Sarah and I had an idea. If Callie couldn't go anymore, perhaps she could give me her ticket so that Sarah and I could go together? 

Sarah and I knew this was a long shot, but it was worth a try. so we used Sarah's phone to text Callie because mine had died.

She asked if I could have the ticket very politely, and we didn't do anything to force or pry. Sarah in NO way said that she'd force Callie to give me her ticket. It went along the lines of:

""Hi, Callie, I totally know this is a long shot, and you don't have to if you don't want to, but I  was wondering if Ivory could maybe have your ticket for the concert so we'd be able to go together? You totally don't have to, just asking.""

Sarah was very nice about it, but Callie replied to it, basically cussing Sarah out, saying ""Why do you care about friends other than me right now? I thought you'd have some sympathy for me"" , and she basically told Sarah to eff off and stuff. 

Afterwards, Sarah apologized profusely, but to no answer.

The next day, Callie calls Sarah over, just to say: ""I don't want to be friends with you anymore, delete my phone number off your phone. Oh yeah, Ellie was right about you.""

That was a low blow. Ellie is a HORRIBLE person. She made fun of Sarah during her ED, she literally BEAT her once, she called Sarah toxic, and so much more. 

Sarah is one of the sweetest people I know.

I obviously felt horrible, part of it was my fault, but Sarah insisted on asking Callie for the ticket, and I thought it would do no harm.

But I also thought that Callie was blowing this WAY out of proportion, so the next day, I walked straight up to her, told her off, for everything she's done, not just the Sarah thing, with includes:

-making a rumor about me and lying to people that I stuffed my bra, then saying it was because she had a crush on me

-calling me fat on numerous occasions

-making fun of me because I'm autistic

-made up a rumor that I was homophobic and ableist (What, im literally pan and autistic?)

-pressuring me into kissing her at a sleepover

The host provides some beverages and like pizza or whatever and we all bring some dessert or snack or something.

Before we got married we consulted a lawyer about what choices we had. We opted to do the route for a green card because he needs to be able to legally work because I will eventually be going back to school. We have been together for over 5 years when we got married. We were ready!  My relationship was kept secret for very long besides from my mother because of the fear of what my father would do if he found out. He is abusive. He found out in 2021. He rejected everything because my husband is not from the USA and because my husband is darker and his first language is Spanish. Being that I was keeping my relationship a secret from my father I was also keeping it hidden from my family up until my dad found out. I did not need people in my family telling my dad and making my life at home worse than it already was. People often have this misconception that my dad will just have to accept it but don’t understand the misery I would have to endure at home with the fighting, the name calling, the control, and etc. I was still very guarded about our relationship after it had come out that we were dating. We got married in his country and started the journey of getting his green card. The wedding was for my husband’s family (most will never be able to travel out of their home country) and also to start the process. Here is why I am asking if AITA because it came out this Christmas that we got married because I put my married name on something public (I know I should not have but I am/was excited)  My g-parents (my mom’s) were furious they were not notified of my wedding. I explained that this wedding was for my husband’s family and not mine and that my own mother was not at the wedding and the wedding was not even planned me it was planned by my husband’s fam because I was in a whole different country and finishing up my bachelors degrees. I thought that this was the end of them being mad because I had explained that we wanted to have our big wedding in the states, but today I went over to my g-parents house 4 months later and my g-pa found a photo of my wedding posted on my MIL facebook or something My g-parents exploded and stated that they did not understand why they did not get at least notified of my wedding. I explained it again, but then because my mom had wanted to invite my g-ma to venue shop with us for our wedding in the US earlier this year my g-ma screamed at me that I had made her look stupid to the venue people and my husband’s family must think they are dog shit because they did not go to the wedding. I got up and walked out and told them I was leaving my g-ma said “good”. I yelled out  that they play favorites and my uncle’s kids are always valued more. My g-parents yelled at me to “suck it up”. I left. I understand that I did not invite them but the wedding was not for them. It was for my husband’s family.

Here is why I am asking if AITA because it came out this Christmas that we got married because I put my married name on something public (I know I should not have but I am/was excited)  My g-parents (my mom’s) were furious they were not notified of my wedding. I explained that this wedding was for my husband’s family and not mine and that my own mother was not at the wedding and the wedding was not even planned me it was planned by my husband’s fam because I was in a whole different country and finishing up my bachelors degrees. I thought that this was the end of them being mad because I had explained that we wanted to have our big wedding in the states, but today I went over to my g-parents house 4 months later and my g-pa found a photo of my wedding posted on my MIL facebook or something My g-parents exploded and stated that they did not understand why they did not get at least notified of my wedding. I explained it again, but then because my mom had wanted to invite my g-ma to venue shop with us for our wedding in the US earlier this year my g-ma screamed at me that I had made her look stupid to the venue people and my husband’s family must think they are dog shit because they did not go to the wedding. I got up and walked out and told them I was leaving my g-ma said “good”. I yelled out  that they play favorites and my uncle’s kids are always valued more. My g-parents yelled at me to “suck it up”. I left. I understand that I did not invite them but the wedding was not for them. It was for my husband’s family.

But he always asks for favours immediately afterwards, like asking me to do yard work for him, or asking to take flowers from my garden.

Maybe I really am the asshole, but I really like my other neighbours, and this guy gives me a bad vibe. He also always has something bad to say about the other neighbours on the block, which makes me afraid not to do the favours he asks because of what he might say about me. 

EDIT: I need to clarify, the issue I'm having is that my wife accepts the gifts, not knowing that he will always ask me for favours afterwards.

She kept trying to get me to just buy the business class tickets for 15 mins, and I just decided I didn't want to go anymore, I walked away and told her that she can decide for herself, I will decide when I want to go.
Later on, she decided to buy economy tickets with my dad, and told me to buy my tickets, but I just told her that I am not buying the tickets, as I don't want to go on the trip anymore.

23,1cw3oi4,AITA for not pushing daughter to follow the path her deceased mother envisioned for her?,"I am a father to a 22-year-old daughter; we lost her mom to a DUI in 2018. Her mom was very career oriented and always pushed her to go to college and have a high-paying job, she also bought all of her clothes and made sure she looked presentable. After her mom died, her grades began plummeting out of control to where she risked not passing most of her classes. I had tried filling that role to give her that push, but it only made her more distant and stubborn.

 

She grew very resentful and depressed to where I feared I'd lose her too. It was a very emotionally turbulent period, but she eventually opened up and revealed that she felt lost because she spent her whole life following her mom’s expectations, and now that she was gone didn’t feel like she had any direction or identity of her own to go forward.

 

After that my main priority shifted towards helping her discover herself and find autonomy, and part of that included going to the mall and giving her the freedom to choose whatever she wanted to wear. She gravitated towards more outlandish styles than anything her mom had ever chosen for her: fishnet, leather, plaid skirts, belts, etc. and started experimenting with vibrant hair color and styling it into mohawk. I figured it was a phase, but she really found herself in this identity and now of days makes a lot of her own designs and gets excited to send me pictures of herself when she makes a new fashion that she wants to share with me.

 

This change put her in a much better place emotionally, but her grades never returned to what they once were. She got rejected by the colleges she had applied for and that's around when the pandemic hit, so she opted out of pursuing college. I said she could stay with me for as long as she needs, and she's still here to this day.

 

The conflict: her maternal grandmother called me the other day. I guess someone had posted a photo at a protest on social media that my daughter could be seen in, and that set her off on me. She claimed that I betrayed the memory of her daughter and that her grandkid should have been graduating college this year and moving out on her own with a good man. That because she now looks like a delinquent, she’s ruined any chance of having a stable life, a respectable job, or a good husband. That she's been set up for failure, doesn't surround herself with people who will push her to grow, and will be stuck living with me. That I should have taken charge instead of letting her make these decisions for herself when she was so young, vulnerable, and confused.



Her words have been eating away at me and left me questioning if there’s merit. I do have doubts and worry about her being well off and having enough security for the future, and she has missed opportunities because of how she presents herself, but I am still proud of who she has become.

Every single night for about 3 years now our dog, scout, has slept with me. The side of my bed is right against my window and she loves to sleep with her head out my window ( don’t worry, it’s only open enough just so she can get her head out, there is no way she could fall out and we live in a very safe town on a very quiet street). My bed has now become her favorite spot in the house. Everyday when I’m at school she’ll just be on my bed looking out the window at everything happening outside. 	
Tonight, when my mom came to say goodnight to me and Scout she told me her plan for when I go off to college. She told me that my sister, who is 16 months younger than me and only one grade behind, will be moving into my room when I go off the college. My current room use to be hers, it is the bigger room, and about 2 years ago we switched for many reasons. My mom said it was so Scout would still have someone to sleep with at night. But I reminded her that Scout is too scared to get on my sisters bed because it has a giant mattress pad so she can’t jump up or jump down, and even when someone does lift her up it’s way to squishy for her to walk on it. Then my mom told me that Scout wouldn’t be sleeping in her bed, she would be sleeping on a dog couch they buy her. I got upset because I don’t want all my stuff moved when I go to college.

I am a 17 year old girl going into my senior year of high school. Obviously, it’s a big year for me as graduation is coming up and I am very excited. I am in the top 5% of my grade and I have worked super hard to ensure that I can get almost all of my college payed for when I leave. Graduation is a huge milestone for me and I want it to be special for me. 

Enter my mom. Ever since I was born she always looks for way to spend less and less money. I would get clothes from family members and if I ever wanted anything, whether it be a new toy, gaming console, etc., it would always have to be a hand me down or refurbished or whatever. I don’t believe I am spoiled. I understand that money is tight and the current state of the economy and all that makes everything expensive. But sometimes I just wish I got something new and not have to worry about the cost or get clothes or items and have stuff that someone else has worn/used. 

Today I went downstairs and my mom showed me the gown she got for my twin sister. I was very confused as summer is just about to start and gown and cap sales don’t start until the school year does. She tells me that she bought that one from a parent whose kid graduated this year and she’s looking for my size now. I got very frustrated and went upstairs to think about what I wanted to do. I don’t know why this matters to me so much but it does. The thought of wearing a cap and gown that someone already walked across the stage with when I’ve worked so hard to become as successful as I am really frustrated me, and I dunno I just want to get a new gown that no one has touched.

I later texted her when I had a calm head and told her that I wanted a new gown for graduation and I’ll pay for whatever she doesn’t want to. She got mad at me and told me senior year is already too expensive and getting a used gown saves money and there’s no difference. I started to get frustrated again and listed out my reasons for wanting a new one but she just dismissed them and told me that she’s sorry I don’t agree with her but I will be getting a used gown. I honestly got really mad and told her then I’ll buy the gown myself and she doesn’t have to worry about it but she still was adamant about it, saying I have to save money for college and other expenses. I have a job and make plenty of money to cover anything thrown my way, plus my parents owe me $1750 bucks anyways. I just kinda ended the convo there after telling her that scholarships can cover my tuition and stuff. 

Now that I’m thinking about it, I’m not sure if I’m in the right and I think I may be acting like a spoiled brat but this really does matter to me and I wish she considered how I felt. So, AITA?

Relevant - Me, Ex-wife, Ex-FIL  
Irrelevant - 4 current fam members, and 2 ex fam members.  
  
Me and Ex-wife divorced partly due to financial irresponsiblity  
My daughter got a free ride thru university, and my ex has been very much in charge of all my daughters finances.  
Neither parent has had to financially contribute towards my daughter during University. My daughter worked had grants for incidentals. I offered to assist, but I wanted full access to at least overview my daughters financial situation, and was met with resistance, and some stuff I frankly found to be shady, like Ex-wife insisting she was on daughters bank account. I have zero knowledge of my daughters finances, and any attempt to encourage my daughter to pull her own credit report etc has been met with excuses like ""I couldn't pull it because it had already been done for the year"" - I suspect there's some fiduciary malfeasance going on, but my daughter doesn't seem to care about it & her main focus has been getting thru Uni.  
  
Anytime my daughter has asked for money for gas, food, or just some money for pizza, I've sent it immediately, as I'm sure my Ex-wife has. Overall my general position has been strictly arms-length when it comes to anything to do with money and my ex wife.  
My ex has more than doubled her income since we divorced, and seems to be living within her means.  
  
After the graduation, we all went to daughters apartment and moved her stuff into our cars, and my Ex-wife had arranged a lunch at a nice little bistro place afterwards ($20-$50 a plate) as it was the only place that could seat a party of our size at that time. - I had no input on this other than ""cool!""

When it came time for the bill, rather than get into a complex split, I simply said ""I'll pay for the 5 of us"" (me, my daughter, and 3 current family members), and we split the bill that way.  
Apparently Ex-FIL picked up the tab for the other half.

The $ split was 75% / 25% with me picking up the 75% and the grand total for the whole table was just north of $330.   
  
On my return home I received a note from my EX-Fil. He was pissed that I had not picked up the whole tab.  
His reasoning was that family members had all traveled to see daughter graduate, helped her move out her apt and got her gifts & given her money. All for MY daughter.  
I immediately apologized, and explained that I had heard someone say ""split it 3 ways"" and I thought I was doing the right thing by paying for more than half the table. I immediately offered to give him the money but he didn't want it.  
  
I have zero experience with university graduations, let alone post-grad-lunches or the social etiquette regarding the billing thereof especially when it comes to Ex's and ex-family members, and so I wondered AITAH ?

31,1cwtoag,"AITA for saying ""I love you"" to my co worker?","I don't even know if I mean asshole but I don't know if I did wrong or what I can do.
I moved to Ireland some months ago, I came from a country with a very different culture, adding that to my autism (that makes harder for me to read the situation) the cultural differences are getting the best out of me. 
My first three months in Ireland were incredible harsh, but then I got a job and instantly bounded with my coworkers. One of them happened to be my neighbor and shared a lot of interest, one of the things that he has in common with me is being part of the LGBT+ community, he has a boyfriend and seems to be in a loving relationship. 

Now, I have said that I love him multiple times. The first time he responded ""I got a boyfriend"" but I just laughed it off. 

For the past week he has been a bit distant and today he said we needed to talk he said I said ""I love you"" a lot and he doesn't see me that way. I thought he was joking so I laugh and said ""Believe me, you are not my type"" but he just stayed serious and said ""I just wanted to clarify"". I just realized he was serious when he went to the elevator and as soon as he saw me going to he said ""Bye"" and used the stairs.

Now, of course I don't like him romantically but I do mean what I said. I care for him and value his friendship very much, so I don't want to lost it. I feel very lost and don't know what to do now. I am writing this fighting the urge to message him since he haven't responded me in the past 2 days and I don't want to accumulate messages because it would look even weirder. 

This person is very opened about cultural differences, we never had this type of problem before. Based on his reaction I think there might be other things that I have done/said that might have sound sexual or romantic, but I am really in the dark now.

Help, how can I fix it?

35,1cwtcv0,AITA for not letting my roommate smoke in her room and bringing her bf for over a week while she’s grieving. ,"my roommate and i were best friends for 6 years and we moved in together over a year and half ago. at first we had great communication, similar life styles,a lot of shared friends and both smoked weed on the balcony. 

i had a bf at the time and she was single. she asked me not to bring my bf over for more than 3 days which i respected and found it appropriate.
during the winter months she had developed a habit to hit the bong in her room which i ignored for a bit even tho it bothered me because as much as i enjoyed weed - i hated the smell of the bong and how it would travel to the shared spaces. as it started getting warmer i asked her to smoke outside but she basically ignored me. she started dating a guy and we stopped hanging out or doing any activities we used to do together and our communication had lessened. her bf would come over for way over 3 days. i kept reminding her to smoke outside less politely and would constantly spray febreze until one day she got petty and sprayed febreze in my face while i was sitting on the balcony. i freaked out at her and said her behaviour is unacceptable - she apologized. 

since then our relationship was getting worse and worse. even tho she started blowing out the smoke out of her window, it would still smell and even go inside my room through my window - which means i couldn’t really have my window open as she smoked every 15 minutes.

about 2 months ago i quit weed and have politely asked her to stop smoking inside as i found the smell more triggering than ever. her bf would stay over a week and i felt very disrespected as she didn’t care for my boundaries and requests. i sent her a big text, politely explaining that i don’t feel good in my home because her bf basically lives with us and the smell is triggering me as someone who quit smoking. her response was saying that if i don’t like the living conditions then i should move out and she has plenty of people who would want to live with her the way she is. i responded with a reminder about our lease which says no smoking inside and only 2 of us on it. she took it as a threat and was passive aggressive. 

i know now, days after the big text, that her relative has passed away (which she didn’t tell me at the time of me sending that text) and it might have contributed to her behaviour and was her way of dealing with grief. even tho she stopped smoking inside and her bf stopped coming every day, she went to our mutual friends and painted me out to be a monster - that i would do something like that to a friend who’s grieving. once again, i was never told her relative has passed away until days later when she already told my friends. i don’t have any communication with her or our shared friends anymore. i can’t help but feel bullied and backstabbed by people i’ve been friends with for 6 years. none of them asked for my side of the story and i feel like i tried to communicate with her so many times. she is very avoidant due to social anxiety, etc. so what do you think? am i the asshole?

i know now, days after the big text, that her relative has passed away (which she didn’t tell me at the time of me sending that text) and it might have contributed to her behaviour and was her way of dealing with grief. even tho she stopped smoking inside and her bf stopped coming every day, she went to our mutual friends and painted me out to be a monster - that i would do something like that to a friend who’s grieving. once again, i was never told her relative has passed away until days later when she already told my friends. i don’t have any communication with her or our shared friends anymore. i can’t help but feel bullied and backstabbed by people i’ve been friends with for 6 years. none of them asked for my side of the story and i feel like i tried to communicate with her so many times. she is very avoidant due to social anxiety, etc. so what do you think? am i the asshole?

36,1cwtc4p,WIBTA if I bought a car my wife couldn’t drive?,"WIBTA if I bought a car my wife can’t drive?

I need to buy a new car, and I would love to have a manual transmission. It’s my one non-negotiable. I grew up driving manual, and I miss it deeply. All of my cars have been inherited, so I’ve never had a say in my car’s features/specs. This will be the first car I’ve purchased for myself. Finally, I’m a “car guy.” I enjoy driving, and I’ve always wanted a sporty car, but also have it fit my needs.

My wife is 7 months pregnant and bought herself a new mid-size SUV last year (with her own money). She views cars as a way of getting from A to B, with practically and comfort.

Note: we have to park our cars back-to-front in our gravel driveway, with one car being in the garage. I will widen the driveway, which I can do it in a weekend, so we can park our cars side-by-side.

We have mostly separate finances, but have a joint CC and checking account, which we both contribute to monthly. The rest is our personal money that we keep in personal bank accounts (including separate savings and separate investments).

I’m paying the down payment and monthly payments on the new car. So I feel the decision is mine, but happy to listen to my wife’s thoughts (reciprocation from her car purchase). 

When I started the car buying process, I went with sport compacts (which are in my budget). Based on our prior discussions, the car has to be a daily commuter for me, allow me to take the kid(s) to/from Daycare, and quick local trips.

My wife thinks these cars are too small and cannot fit our needs with a baby and a potential second child. She says there’s not enough space for kids stuff (there is) and the backseats won’t fit two backward-facing car seats (they will). I’ve tried to show her my research, but she refused to watch the videos or read the articles I’ve bookmarked. 

Her main sticking point is she won’t be able to drive it because it’s a manual. She’s concerned she won’t be able to drive it when she’ll need to (in an emergency). I told her I’m happy to teach her manual, but at first she flat out refused to learn. Now she says she’ll learn, but gives an excuse of how we’ll be too busy. I said if it’s that important she drive the car, her mom can stay for a weekend to watch the baby and we can take a day for her to learn. Again, she said we won’t have time. 

Every time we discuss it, she accuses me of ignoring our family and that she needs to be able to drive the car. I say she’s creating a false dichotomy, and the car I want can fit our needs. I also argue that her car can be the big family car for trips or hauling, and my car can be for easy parking during city trips or sports events. Note: I don’t drink, so I will always be able to drive.

We’ve had many arguments over this. The most recent resulted in her giving me the cold shoulder for 2 days. I am at my wits end and ready to buy without her blessing. 

WIBTA if I ignored my wife’s objections and got the car I wanted?

Edit: I’m specifically looking at is a Honda Civic Si. We live walking distance to urgent care, CVS, and a grocery store. Our neighbor is a NICU nurse if shit really hits the fan. And we do “baby sit” my FIL’s SUV (he works/lives abroad), which we use on occasion, but we don’t know when he’ll be returning. So a third car is not an option for now

Edit 2: Classic RIP my inbox.
After parsing through this thread, there are separate issues at play that I’ve sorted out and here’s what I’ve gathered.

1. IWBTA for BUYING a car my wife can’t drive WITHOUT her blessing - yes, I fully acknowledge my timing of this is awful. I will postpone the purchase until after the baby arrives and I’ll get an automatic to ensure we both drive the car.

2. I’m not an asshole for WANTING a manual car and the model of car I want is reasonable. My wife could learn eventually, but that’s her choice. Again, my timing is terrible (which makes me the A-hole) so I’m going to get my “fun car” in a few years time. 

Clarifying point: I don’t want an SUV. They’re more expensive and I much prefer driving a car that’s not high up. I also think automotive companies have shoved a narrative down American’s throats that SUVs are the ONLY family friend options which is false. Literally just look at the rest of the world.

39,1cwt7v1,"WIBTA for not picking sides in a ""friend group""?","All names are fake!

Basically me and a ""friend"" named had a falling out that didn't affect the whole friend group but caused some tension. It was over a mean joke I made about myself and it made her upset. This wasn't nina's first time getting upset at me for a self deprecating joke.

Last month was prom and our whole group went including another girl who is friends with Nina. Prom night was fun aside from a few times where I felt left out and pushed aside because of Nina and her best friend, Emily's, need to lead the group. Other than that I thought this was just going to be a normal school dance.

This all happened on prom day. So before prom we went to go eat and according to Jacey, Ingrid had been staring at Jacey and texting Nina and they they started talking in their native language. Then the following day at school, Helena, Jacey's ""best friend"", was talking bad about Ingrid and her bf because Ingrid would get jealous when anyone would get close to her boyfriend. All jacey did was agree with her and just say that she didn't really like Ingrid from the start because she would treat Nina bad.

Ava took this as an opportunity to tell Nina what Helena and Jacey had said. I guess Nina told everyone else aside from me, jacey, and Helena. They all left our shared group chat and then the next day me and ava stayed together. Ava also tried to tell me all the bad things Jacey and Helena did (none of us are innocent of talking bad about each other, they all have said worse things) and even invited me to a group trip with her and the other girls.

44,1cwsooi,AITA for talking badly about my childhood friend to my college friends?,"For reference, I (19f) and childhood friend (let’s call them Kay (19m)) have been friends for approximately 16 years. We met in preschool and were very close until about 5th grade- we reconnected in middle school and became close again during freshman year of high school. 

Around this time in our friendship, I began to notice patterns of behavior that were alarming- he would consistently joke about my intelligence, appearance, and talent, belittled my achievements, and minimized my successes. We did theater together, and he would always compete with me and joke that I was always his understudy, which stung because theater is something that I adore and Kay is indifferent to- they just liked to feel like they were better than me. This is just one of many reasons why the friendship was not great.

We had one notable argument, but stayed friends until we graduated, when we naturally parted ways due mostly to distance.
 
This is when I might be TA- this year, I started college at a university out of state. I met two amazing friends and we just click as a group and as individuals. After getting very comfortable with said friends, we would talk about our lives (even got some of those card games that are just questions to ask each other) and Kay came up. I didn’t explain everything at once, but after a few conversations, they got the gist.

What I didn’t expect was that by Christmas, my college friends and I were close enough that they came to stay at my house for about a week. It was very fun and everything was going well- and then we bumped into Kay while I was showing them around town

It was fine at first- a quick hug and conversation, very usual- and then Kay introduced himself to my friends. When I turned to look at my friends, one of them had a physical reaction (her face dropped) but she composed herself quickly.

I hoped that Kay hadn’t noticed, but he messaged me later and I admitted that Idfk told my friends about our friendships ups and downs. He told me that it was humiliating for him and that I had no right to talk about our friendship with other people.

47,1cwrhyy,"AITA, 27F for not agreeing to pay €95 to have my makeup and hair done on the morning of wedding. ","
My best friend (Bride), is expecting her bridesmaids to pay for their hair and makeup on her big day. 

Background: We were raised in a low socioeconomic area, she and her fiance is not honest of her income on tax years. In addition most of the guests are from the same area and financially supported by the government. Final point before you judge - she has decided to go for the big white wedding, 110km/70miles away leaving guests no option but to pay €185 to stay in a hotel or €80 (both ways). I’m all for supporting her wedding but I feel she’s not considering her guests and forgetting the town we were raised in. I’m left questioning that if she’s kept the wedding low and affordable then maybe I’d be + €250 (I’ll discus the €250 later)


I did speak to my best friend (bride) and mentioned that I would like to do my own makeup in a natural style (nothing glam). I further expressed that I’m not financially stable and €45 is a lot of pennies when I’d be doing my brows and eyes (including hair/makeup I’m going to be -€250 before presents for the wedding). However, on the upside I said I’ll pay €50 to have my hair styled to match the bridal party. 

Cost breakdown:
€95 bridal hair and makeup 
€85 hen do
€70 bridal suite ([night before wedding] altogether it costs €1.6k but bride is paying half)


For context, my issue is I have alopecia on the face and have learnt over the years the best way to draw my eyebrows and apply lashes which has led to a side hussle in makeup. In previous years the bride and the bridal party would pay for me to do their makeup for occasions and nights out as they were confident in my abilities. 

Before posting this, yesterday I did propose to my best friend (bride) that I’d prefer to do my own makeup as it’s a lot of money for something I can do myself and that I’m struggling financially. However she wasn’t happy that I was making a “fuss” as I “agreed” to be her bridesmaid.  

It’s clear at the moment, either her way or the highway…

Altogether, would I be the asshole if I turned up on the day with my makeup done?

Cut to January of this year, I've been following an artist on Twitter for over 2 years now and I've approached them asking if they did custom adoptables, they said yes, and proceeded to discuss what the adoptable would be, body type, etc.

The price ended up being 350 USD, which, although is high, I believe is a good price for their art.

The problem starts after paying the commission, I was expecting to receive updates on how the adoptable has been going, however, these updates never come up until they're requested to the artist, I've seen them posting more and more adoptables on Twitter and their telegram channel, Work in progress of their other work and recently, they posted about how they got fired from their job for something they didn't do and how they had to get their AC unit fixed due to the extreme heat waves in Mexico at the moment.

As of right now, they're already posting another character to auction and I haven't heard from them since the coloring stage.

My question is, WIBTA if I requested a refund for this? I understand that the artist is having a hard time with his side of things, I don't want to make them loose some of his livelihood by requesting a refund, but at this point I don't feel comfortable waiting another 6 months for something I can clearly see he can work faster than he has shown to me.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-20,"WIBTA If I decide I don't want a commission from an artist anymore?

Student and am part of a fairly big friend group. We share the same interests, wanna make plans for stuff during times like the summer, etc. But lately I don’t feel much included with my friend group.

While yes I have friends who are great to be around, there are also a few of them who have been very hostile towards me. One friend (we’ll call him A) has made multiple threats towards me, has stricken me a few occasions, and then acts like we’re all “buddy buddy” afterwards. 

Another friend (we’ll call her K) has made very rude remarks towards me about being gay. For context a lot of people would mistake me for being gay when I was younger due to my very long hair and how I don’t act as manly as everyone. I’ve asked her to stop but her excuse is that she’s only doing this because I was apparently mean to her in the 5th grade (I had some trouble with anger but I don’t at all remember it showing up during school, also that was years ago and I’ve tried making it up to the people I feel I’ve wronged then on multiple occasions.)

There are a few more examples but I don’t want to make this too long (also I can’t remember them at this moment other than one kid who is very creepy around me and another who makes hitler jokes around me because I’m part Jewish). I’ve told other friends who have been nice to me but all I feel I’ve received is an “ok” or a “damn”. 

I know I shouldn’t expect for them to just stop being their friend and I know I’m not the nicest kid but I feel as if they get to do the same things I do but worse and they get to keep their friends because “we would do the same” or “it’s not that bad”. But if I do it (even if it’s way tamer) I’m going too far or I deserve to get beaten up.

I don’t know if I’m just a brat who doesn’t get what they want or if I actually have good reasons. I could switch schools but if I switch I can’t come back and this school with set me up for at least the foreseeable future if I play my cards right (also we get field trips and the teachers are nice).

There are a few more examples but I don’t want to make this too long (also I can’t remember them at this moment other than one kid who is very creepy around me and another who makes hitler jokes around me because I’m part Jewish). I’ve told other friends who have been nice to me but all I feel I’ve received is an “ok” or a “damn”. 

I know I shouldn’t expect for them to just stop being their friend and I know I’m not the nicest kid but I feel as if they get to do the same things I do but worse and they get to keep their friends because “we would do the same” or “it’s not that bad”. But if I do it (even if it’s way tamer) I’m going too far or I deserve to get beaten up.

I don’t know if I’m just a brat who doesn’t get what they want or if I actually have good reasons. I could switch schools but if I switch I can’t come back and this school with set me up for at least the foreseeable future if I play my cards right (also we get field trips and the teachers are nice).

51,1cwr8qe,AITA for freaking out on my mum for her wanting to move out,"Hello, 

I am a 18 year old female and my mum is a 59 year old female. My parents and I were all living together until about two years ago when they split up. I originally moved in with my dad (49)  as I wanted to keep our family dog (only my dad could take him due to housing requirements my mum had and he refused to keep him without extra help (could be a post in itself lol)) however due to my dad and I's strained relationship and my own mental health (I struggled with anxiety , depression and agoraphobia until I was 16, I dropped out of school and have only recently started earning some actual solid money after working part time mini jobs until I had a handle on my mental health) I couldn't handle living with him and moved in with my half-sister (37) temporarily until my mums lease ended and we could afford to rent a house together. We have been living in said house for about 4 months now and my mum has just told me that by  early next year she wants to be moved out and travelling with her new boyfriend, and then late next year she wants to move in with him, which will be about an hour and a half drive. By this point my dad will have moved in with his girlfriend, at least an hour away. Which leaves me, to figure out my own housing, now with no spare money because I have been paying rent with my mum by next year. I lost my shit with my mum when she first told me but have since calmed down somewhat. Another thing to add is that I was dealing with a stalker until maybe a year ago and still struggle to be alone in the house at night because of that also.

Did I overreact? I am angry with both of my parents for moving on with their lives and leaving me somewhat in the dust, but especially with my mum as I never expected this from her, whereas I did with my dad. I know I am legally an adult but I feel like after my issues with my mental health I missed it on so much developmentally, and since I only have a few GCSES and not much experience I worry I'm not going to be able to get a well paying enough job at this age to live on my own. I really want my parents to be happy, but I feel as though they are forgetting about me in the process.

52,1cwr825,AITA for being rude to my dad after he fat shamed me?,"  This happened yesterday. I’m rlly just in shock right now that this happened. I am 14f and my relationship with my father wasn’t always cupcakes and rainbows, but yesterday i thought it HAD to be getting better. we went on a walk through nature, talked about God,issues with family. He even took me to some historical places! We overall had a great time. 

   Night time was when it changed. Before bed, I always talk to my mother just because i like to. We were talking about how she fat shamed me constantly. She’s not a bad mother,don’t get the wrong idea. she told me she says these things so i don’t have to hear HIM saying them to me as i already pretty much hated him enough .

   “you don’t even want to know what your father said about you the other day” and maybe i shouldn’t have pryed more, but i did. Last thursday, dad was outside working on the deck. I walked by in short denim shorts and a crop top and he made throwing up motions apparently. I am not obese by any means,just naturally a bit more curved than other girls my age. I’m healthy so i don’t understand why he is so repulsed by the way i look.

   I didn’t hear but my mother called him out and told him that was disgusting to say about your child. He may be fatphobic because he has a pattern of fat shaming literally everyone like my AUNT(moms sister),my neighbors,even my dog! (not to mention he just fat shamed jelly roll..yea,the country singer who he adores.)  
 
  he’s said more about me being “fat” but never to my face because my mom always takes the blame. After my mother told me, I broke down crying. And this morning during class and while getting ready i was crying too, because i really thought he had changed.

  I think we’re back at square 1. i haven’t talked to him normally since and today i gave him a lot of attitude otw to school. I was also very angry with him today to which he said “you don’t have a right to be ornery”.He doesn’t know i know, so it may be a little unfair that im lashing out.

53,1cwqt0r,AITA for being inconsiderate of my bf's insecurity?,"throwaway

I've recently found that my (f26) boyfriend (m24) is insecure about his height. (I'm about 4 inches taller)

It suddenly became a problem last week, when there was a local dance ball we planned to go to.

As I was getting ready, he asked what shoes am I wearing. I picked 3 inch strappy heels. He got upset, arguing that I'm already tall enough and it will look stupid if I'm that much taller when we dance.

I have atrophied fat pads on my feet, so I'm basically walking on my bones and it can get very painful -which is why I don't even own any flat shoes.

He showed me a pic of flat ballerina type shoes and said we should just pick some up at a store on the way and it would be just fine with my orthopedic insoles in.

It would be ""just fine"" if we went out to eat, not to dance. I told him it would still be painful and tried to compromise with 1 inch heel. He kept arguing about it and then stormed off.

Later he confessed he's been feeling insecure for a while now and I should've been more considerate and just did as he said.

Since then, every time he sees me put shoes on, he keeps bringing it up and starting another argument. I also realised that in every photo he posts of us has me always sitting down.

During the last argument we had, I told him I’ve never seen the height difference as an issue until he made it into one and if it makes him feel that bad to be seen with me, then maybe we're just not compatible.

He‘s packed his things and left. Now he’s going around telling everyone that I’m breaking up with him because he’s short. I had his mom leave me angry messages.

For me, it’s the fact that he fully expected me to just bear with the pain without question. I feel if he cared for me, he wouldn’t want me to be in pain.

54,1cwqqji,WIBTA if i told a friend/acquaintance how her bf really feels about her?,"I (24F) am somewhat friends with my bf’s (M, 25M) friend’s (B, 24M) gf (E, 20F). B and E have been together about a year and a half now. Her and I go back and forth on getting along due to her attitude and lack of maturity (imo).

Friday M and B were out together (which is rare these days, as E is very possessive of B and rarely lets him go out without her with) and M came home with stories from the night. All fun and dandy. Until M tells me, ‘B said “yeah I love her, but I dont care if she (E) would leave”’. Im not a huge fan of E because i think we started off on the wrong foot and i have no hate for her now, but im devastated for her. 

No one should ever have to be in a relationship where their partner says that about them. I would say B is immature and just not ready to grow up. B was the last boy in their friend group to have a long term gf (yet is rarely single, always bounced from girl to girl. B was even cheated on before and knew about it and didnt break up with the gf at the time, she had to break up with B. Knowing this, i know B will never break up with E, E would have to break up with B) and im afraid B picked E as an easy option to just settle so B wasn’t alone. 

E has her temper, but I do believe E has a good heart and good intentions at the end of the day. E has goals for herself and for them as a couple. And B seems to just say ‘yes’ to get E to shut up about it all. Such as buying a house, wedding, etc. (more background: E lives with B at his moms house, E is about to graduate college, they have similar hobbies and E has forced her way to be with B every time B goes out, ie no more ‘boys days’)

WIBTA if I told E what B said about her? ‘I love her, but i dont care if she leaves’

1. I want to tell her because if i were in her spot, i hope someone would tell me so i could break it off. 
2. I dont want her to feel like im creating drama to get them to break up. (I dont want them to break up if she wants to stay.) But i feel like she should at least know so she can make her own decision.
3. I dont want to insert myself into their relationship as I have no idea what its like on the inside. I am friends with B’s sister who also lives at home, and what she tells me is they just fight a lot
4. I dont want to ‘start drama’ and that end up ruining M and B’s friendship. Even though it is already strained since B got with E, it has just gone downhill since. M and B dont see each other much, im not invited much anymore, etc.

ETA: from the beginning of E being around I always wanted to be friends with her. So we can have girls days while the boys go out or even for double dates all hanging out together. Ive been optimistic until recently. I constantly try to reach out to E to make girls day plans or group plans for us to all get together. It either ends in me being left on read, or plans being made and then being canceled last minute by B or E due to a better opportunity coming up for them. 

Its been a confusing year and a half, not wanting to step on toes by asking to hang out too much, but also not wanting to lose the friendships we all had before E came around. I dont have anything to truly hold against E, yes we may disagree sometimes but ultimately i want to be her friend. Especially since they do talk about buying a house together, and getting married in the somewhat near future, etc. i want to support them, i want to be there for them, i want everything to work out for the best for everyone involved. I just feel i get mixed signals from E sometimes so I’m not sure how to be apart of their lives in a way that benefits everyone.

57,1cwqllo,WIBTA if I won't allow my sons GF to move in with him?,"I’m seeking some solid advice. I run a successful online business, and I am financially well-off. My 25-year-old son works for me and lives in one of my homes located in another state. He doesn't pay rent or utilities but handles basic maintenance and upkeep of the property. Although my son is a competent worker, he struggles with low self-esteem and depression and has a quick temper when things don’t go his way. We’ve provided him with counseling, but he’s resistant to discussing emotional issues and usually quits therapy after a couple of months. He has a girlfriend with whom he has had an on-and-off relationship for the past six years.  
His girlfriend comes from a dysfunctional family with significant mental health and financial issues. She is on the autism spectrum, suffers from severe hypochondria, and dislikes most of the activities we enjoy as a family. She is a frequent complainer and seems perpetually unhappy. Their relationship is tumultuous; they fight frequently and seem to bring out the worst in each other. Despite our reservations, we’ve included her in family events and trips, covering all her expenses.  
Four years ago, after a particularly challenging trip, we expressed our concerns about their relationship to our son, and he agreed, leading to their breakup. However, they remained friends, and recently, they’ve rekindled their relationship. My son lives in a rural area, works online, rarely socializes, and has been feeling lonely, which led to this reconciliation.  
Over the past several months, it’s again become clear that their relationship hasn’t grown or improved. They don’t seem to enjoy each other’s company, show little affection, and barely communicate.

He’s mentioned wanting to move out and get an apartment with her, but he would need my additional financial support to afford it, as his current wages are insufficient. She still lives with her parents and works a dead-end minimum-wage job. My business cannot afford to pay him more than he currently earns. We actually tried to move him and a close friend of his to our location, where we provided another home and jobs for both of them, but he missed his hometown and grandparents and moved back after 2 months. ",Asshole,2024-05-20,"WIBTA if I won't allow my sons GF to move in with him? I’m seeking some solid advice. I run a successful online business, and I am financially well-off. My 25-year-old son works for me and lives in one of my homes located in another state. He doesn't pay rent or utilities but handles basic maintenance and upkeep of the property. Although my son is a competent worker, he struggles with low self-esteem and depression and has a quick temper when things don’t go his way. We’ve provided him with counseling, but he’s resistant to discussing emotional issues and usually quits therapy after a couple of months. He has a girlfriend with whom he has had an on-and-off relationship for the past six years.  
His girlfriend comes from a dysfunctional family with significant mental health and financial issues. She is on the autism spectrum, suffers from severe hypochondria, and dislikes most of the activities we enjoy as a family. She is a frequent complainer and seems perpetually unhappy. Their relationship is tumultuous; they fight frequently and seem to bring out the worst in each other. Despite our reservations, we’ve included her in family events and trips, covering all her expenses.  
Four years ago, after a particularly challenging trip, we expressed our concerns about their relationship to our son, and he agreed, leading to their breakup. However, they remained friends, and recently, they’ve rekindled their relationship. My son lives in a rural area, works online, rarely socializes, and has been feeling lonely, which led to this reconciliation.

58,1cwqkjt,AITA for trying to reconnect with a friend?,"So i most recently lost my very best and a close friend to me over a dumb argument.   
And i've been trying to reconnect with her without any success.   
Me 26M  Friend is 20F

So i've know this girl for maybe 8 months and we met over a game on Steam.   
then we started to talk on discord and been talking daily since then basically, we play games, do vc's even watch movies together or just listen to music we share. It's nothing sexual or romantic either, strickly friendship and i am really comfortable with that. But lately she started to talk with someone else and that person apparently tried to ship us two or something and ever since then, my friend has changed. We rarely talk as we used to. Doesn't seem to wanna voice chat or play any games anymore and i straight up asked her and she said she feels uncomfortable with the idea me and her as a couple. 

Which kinda annoyed me cause i'm not intrested in a relationship. I'm recently divorced and i'm happy to be single for the time being. So there wont be anything romantic between me and her, and she knows this. But for some reason she can't let go of what that other person said. 

And just one day decide to end our friendship,She didn't say why or anything. just straight up removes me cause i was about to ask her if she wanted to watch a movie. and i saw the message couldn't be deliverd and then i saw she actually unfriended me. 

that was like 2 months ago now. And i've been trying to reconnect with my friend cause i miss her. We understood each other and had a great time with each other and i miss playing games with her.   
But everytime i try to reconnect. I'm getting blocked. She removed me on Steam, Discord, Instagram, Facebook and on Tiktok. 

We share 4 servers on discord and i've actually sent a message in one of the general chat cause she is most active in that server. But i'm just getting ignored by her and she answers everyone else instead.

59,1cwqj0n,AITA for wanting to live with my mom instead of my grandparents,"I(16F) will be moving to the USA over the summer. For background info. My mom and grandparents don’t have a good relationship at all and there is just a lot of tension between them. I used to live in the US with my grandparents and then I moved back to the UK with my mom. I barely had a relationship with my mom when I lived in the US, but since I had to live with her again. We built our relationship and in a better place, compared to when I first started living with her. Now I don’t want to lose our relationship and I don’t know what to do. I’m at a crossroad with my feelings.

My first option is to live in a different state with my mom and her dad. The thing is I’m uneasy as I have never been there before and not sure if I will like it all. I want to see what’s it’s like living with her in that state first before I make the decision to stay with her to see if I like it. It will be a whole new scenery and something that I’m not used to. I know that my mom will support me and be by my side. 

My second option is to live with my Grandparents. It’s been a few years since I have lived with them and they have like a large amount of standards that I have been told by my brother(15M) that I don’t fit their standards. If I live with them, obviously I will conform to their rules, but all I can think about is not being a burden to them. I want to be a ghost and for them to basically ignore me, I don’t want to be dependent on them. I feel the need to just keep myself in a shell. 
Additionally, I spoke to my aunty a while ago. (She used to take care of us when we lived in the US, she also lives with my grandparents) I just felt hostility from her. She had said that we will be living with our grandparents and not her. But they live in the same house, so it just felt like she was icing me out. While on call, I couldn’t be straight up with her. I was beating around the bush and I feel a pressure in my chest that doesn’t want me to speak. She used to be my role model and now it’s just super different. I just can’t talk to her anymore about anything and with the way she spoke on the phone. It just felt more prominent.
-My brother is sure on moving there and living with them! He has made his decision to live there.

However, I feel like an outcast, like unwanted space or they have these superficial ideas about me that I don’t like. The idea of living with them feels really uncomfortable. However, I think the opportunity living with them will be better, but at the cost of my mental health and personality. 

So, I either the option to live with my mom in a different state, where I have never been before. Or live with my grandparents where I feel all these negative emotions about the situation and it’s all in my head. And not until I experience I can make a decision, but this is taking over my mind.

61,1cwqar2,AITA for giving preference to my internship over my friend's funeral.,"My friend back from high school died recently in a car accident. Hearing about his death was quite shocking since he was only 20. I was invited to his funeral which was going to be held in my hometown. It is also important to note that we weren't close since we went to college. He almost never called me and we never even met after high school. I tried contacting him but he always ignored me. I was still thinking of attending the funeral however, I didn't due due to my internship.

For more context, I am interning at a MAANG company (more specifically Meta) and believe myself to be in a strong position to receive a return offer. Throughout my internship I've always completed projects before time and have impressed my seniors. As the funeral was taking place on the other side of the country, it would take up an entire week at least. I'm sure my manager would have allowed me to take a week off which is also something my mom was suggesting.

However, I worried that it might not look good and they may change their opinion about me and decide not to give me a return offer. So I did not end up going.

My parents are both disappointed in me to say the least. In fact I would say they're quite angry that I didn't go. According to them, I'm becoming ""anti social"" and only caring about money. They said all I talk about these days is my salary and the wonderful office I work at, which is making me lose my ""humanity"".

They're also claiming that I was best friends with him (that isn't even remotely true) and yet I didn't even bother showing up for his funeral. They're also trying to gaslight me into believing that receiving a return offer from Meta is quite easy and that I made up the difficulty because I wanted to provide an excuse.

62,1cwpxf8,AITA Joint birthday party gone wrong that I never wanted ,"A few years ago I had some friends who one had a birthday a few days before mine. She kept hinting at my friend she wanted a surprise party. My birthday fell on a Saturday so my friend hinted at doing a joint bday party that day I told her then I didn’t really want to share my birthday(because it’s the one day of the year I can do whatever I want) but they went ahead and planned it anyways. I just let it slide. The friends birthday fell two days before and we went out and celebrated her and it was a great time. Then the day of the birthday party turns out her boyfriend who was in charge of inviting her friends did not. So only my friends were there and most of them did not know we were celebrating her as well since it was my actual bday. I tried reminding everyone and making sure not all the attention was on me as best I could. My husband had booked a karaoke room for us and when we got there the other girls boyfriend did not have his id so he said it’s no biggie and waited in the car. The whole time my friend sulked in the corner and was clear she wasn’t even trying to have a good time. Fast forward two days the girl ghosted both me and the girl who planned the party for two days. When she finally responded and told us what was wrong she complained the party didn’t center around her and it was all about me. This was exactly why I didn’t want the party. I got very offended and told my friend she was being ungreatful because my husband paid for us all to do karaoke and it was $400. She got mad at me and I tried to ask if we could talk in person but she would never make plans. Fast forward a few weeks and her and the girl who planned the party kept hanging without me and not inviting me which was out of the ordinary at the time. Finally they invited me over. I used it as an opportunity to talk to her and say I was sorry for what I said and how things turned out. I cried and expressed how I felt left out though. At the time she apologized and told me she would be better. Then a few weeks later with no changed behavior I told my friend I didn’t understand why she was treating me so poorly. My friend then proceeds to tell me she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore after how the birthday party played out and she also said after I cried about being left out once I left the friend laughed to my friend and said she wanted to laugh in my face the whole time I was crying. The next day the girl asked for one of my craft supplies to borrow and I told her she could buy her own. She never confronted me and deleted me on everything so I sent her a long text about how she treated me poorly and if she had bad vibes it was only because of how she acted and reacted. This girl to this day slanders me, talks to people she knows hates me and has started some online hate campaigns cause of it. To this day I stand by what I did and feel I was treated poorly in this situation. But I do not understand how anything I did has warranted such unfair treatment. Am I the asshole?

64,1cwprts,"AITA - Friends ghosted me, valid or not?","okay, i've been needing to get this off my chest and really understand and see if i'm wrong or not.

this might a bit lengthy but any feedback is welcomed - i've been working on myself a lot and always willing to learn and grown.

i got pregnant in 2022 and in the beginning, had a really hard time with it (first trimester was brutal, the morning sickness was terrible, i had prenatal depression etc). throughout my pregnancy, i felt super lonely and isolated from my group of friends (these friends were ones i was close to since college - we partied and traveled all the time together. mostly partied TBH)

while pregnant, no one really reached out to me and asked how i was doing or how i was feeling (mind you, my husband and i are the first ones in this group to get married and have a baby). but what hurt me most was 2 of my bridesmaids, who i was super close to and were my dearest friends, who never checked up on me. they never asked how i was doing, how i was feeling etc. and that really hurt me. they're the type of people to never want kids so i get that they probably didn't understand how i was feeling or what to do in these situations but during my pregnancy, i was very hurt by the lack of thoughtfulness and care.

pretty much what happened after was i had a gender reveal party and didn't invite one of the girls. she pretty much ghosted me after she found out about the gender reveal party and didn't talk to me. i texted her multiple times, apologizing for how i hurt her by not inviting her and how i was upset that it felt like she didn't care to check up on me, let alone really talk to me? we hadn't texted much for the past few months. with these lengthy texts, i ended up telling her that i was planning on cutting ties with the other girl (the 3 of us were all close) because i, again, felt like she didn't reach out to talk to me etc and felt like she didn't care.

well, this girl i was apologizing to and texting (who ghosted me) told the other girl what i had said. so now, this second girl is upset at me. she ended up texting me a lengthy text pretty much saying she didn't want to be friends with me. i responded by asking if i can call her and talk to her so we can talk about this and she ignored my call. i then ended up texting her and apologizing and explaining why i said what i said (honestly, i was never going to cut her off - it was my stupid hormones and emotions while being pregnant that impaired my judgement). i said i'd like to talk (i said that to both the girls, saying i'd like to talk about this so we can understand each other better) but they both ghosted me. i never heard back and to this day, don't speak to them.

sorry - super lengthy (there's more details i left out but this is the general gist)

but all in all, AITA? on my end, i feel like i genuinely tried to talk to them and fix our problems. yes, i understand i was the one who caused them and i hurt them and i fully own up to that and have apologized and told them how i know i messed up. but they've decided to ghost me and never speak to me again.",TL;DR,2024-05-20,"AITA - Friends ghosted me, valid or not? okay, i've been needing to get this off my chest and really understand and see if i'm wrong or not.

this might a bit lengthy but any feedback is welcomed - i've been working on myself a lot and always willing to learn and grown.

i got pregnant in 2022 and in the beginning, had a really hard time with it (first trimester was brutal, the morning sickness was terrible, i had prenatal depression etc). throughout my pregnancy, i felt super lonely and isolated from my group of friends (these friends were ones i was close to since college - we partied and traveled all the time together. mostly partied TBH)

while pregnant, no one really reached out to me and asked how i was doing or how i was feeling (mind you, my husband and i are the first ones in this group to get married and have a baby). but what hurt me most was 2 of my bridesmaids, who i was super close to and were my dearest friends, who never checked up on me. they never asked how i was doing, how i was feeling etc. and that really hurt me. they're the type of people to never want kids so i get that they probably didn't understand how i was feeling or what to do in these situations but during my pregnancy, i was very hurt by the lack of thoughtfulness and care.

66,1cwpq8m,AITA for wanting my GF to register my vehicle in her name?,"So for some context. My girlfriend is an International student in Italy. I live and work in another European country. However my work allows me to work remotely quite a lot. That way I am able to spend a significant amount of time in Italy with her.

Now I have wanted to buy a motorcycle in Italy for a few months to use when I am there. The issue is in Italy you have to be a registered resident to buy and insure vehicles there. My girlfriend is a registered resident and I do not qualify to be a registered resident there as I spend less than half the year each calendar year inside the country. I have contacted insurance companies that have said it would not be any issue to insure ""her"" motorcycle with me registered as a second driver.

Now my girlfriend flat out refuses to accept to register it in her name. Even though I have assured her the motorcycle will be paid up-front, insurance and all taxed paid for the full year in one transaction. Therefore not a single monthly payment would be required of her.

Her reasoning is that ""I don't think it is a good idea if we're only here for a few years"" and that ""you will lose money on this"". I realise and accept that I will lose money on this, therefore I don't see her reasoning.

We have had a few repeated arguments about this. What annoys me the most is that I did not hesitate to help her get a rental apartment in Italy. I signed as a guarantor for her, forked up thousands of euros for the security deposit and rental agency fees and even pay 70% of her rent without any of the rental contract being in my name. When I bring this up to my GF she says I am being unfair as those things are ""easy for me to do"". When I point out that what I am asking of her is also easy for her to do she just says the same things. ""I don't think it is a good idea"", ""I don't feel comfortable with it"". 

I wouldn't hesitate to do this for her if the roles were reversed. However I do realise that what I am requesting of her isn't exactly the correct way of doing things. Due to the arguments and how big of a deal this seems to be for her it got me thinking. Am I in the wrong? Is it a big deal to register your partners vehicle in your name? Am I the asshole?

67,1cwpoi2,AITA for telling my family I don’t want to go on the family’s vacation to Aruba   ,"My family has planned a trip for my sister and she chose to go to Aruba. I (18M) obviously know that Aruba is a gorgeous island and people would love to go there. I’ve been to the Bahamas once with my family and it was alright. I don’t like the aspect of these types of vacations where I’m just at a hotel resort and being treated.

 Also I personally just despise traveling with my family. Arguments and disagreements tend to break out on vacation, always. I already don’t have a good relationship with my parents, especially my father. I definitely don’t want to go with him as he’s seemed to pick up drinking again or maybe he’s been using some type of drug judging by his eyes. Yesterday and today he came home drunk at 10am in the morning and then sleeps for the rest of the day. I really don’t want to spend any type of time with him. 

My family also has a pet dog and cat, so I need to have my friend come in to take care of them. I need to teach him what he needs to know and there’s just a lot of small details. I know for a fact that my dog becomes very stressed when we’re not around and she tends to not eat, so it really pains me to leave her like this. 

I’ve already brought up to them the fact I don’t want to go. My mother told me that she doesn’t even want to go either. However my father told me “no questions asked, you’re going”. I know that if I just hold my ground I would be able to stay home, but AITA and just being unreasonable.

Stealing alcohol, and more stuff like that. Obviously you'd need so much more info that I can't think of right now but yeah. So today I came in to my house from football with my youngest brother (14M) and noticed he'd left a pizza in the oven on maximum heat for 30 minutes and the house smelled of burning. the pizza had been taken out by my mother and left on the side, and it was just black and he had no intention of taking it out. Almost as if he wanted the house to burn down lol.

She refused to go up to my brother's room to talk to him about this or to tell him off for being lazy and that doing something like this is dangerous, instead she insisted on staying downstairs and waiting for him to come downstairs so she could presumably just make a snarky remark at him instead, most likely due to the fact that she thinks talking to him has no effect on him.

Ever since he started at my job, I’ve constantly heard negative things about him.  We usually work opposite shifts, but for a while he was working with me and I was training him.  I then saw it with my own eyes.  He is incredibly lazy and has no sense of urgency which is needed to work at the level me and my other coworkers do.

My immediate supervisor knows he is my brother in law, and constantly asks to talk to him to “guide him” or steer him in the right direction.  I’ve tried but he does not listen.  

Around the house he also is very lazy.  He doesn’t clean up after himself in the bathroom which he shares with the other roommate.  I’ve been told he leaves his shaved pubes on the toilet, his facial hair in the sink, he throws away his shitty toilet paper instead of flushing it, and has never cleaned the shower.  Just this past weekend me and my wife were out of town and the other roommate had to work, and we asked him to take our dogs out to the backyard when they cry (so they can go potty). Not once did I see him out with the dogs in my Ring camera.  The dogs were inside all day until 9pm when the other roommate came home.  


At this point I am very fed up with him and don’t acknowledge him anymore when I see him.  My wife senses it too and she feels bad because of how he acts.

She also believes I don’t deserve to cry over my grandma because I “traumatized” myself by taking care of her and watching her die. 

My family says I’m not being selfish, but my mother’s voice rings in my head. Do you think I’m being selfish towards my family? I don’t think I have to attend everything to show my grandma and my family how much I love(d) my grandma. ",0.0,0.0008098415564745665,0,1
72,1cwor5k,WIBTA If i remove a girl from my planning groupchat?,"

I'm (17F) ,and the girl in the story is (17F)

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. There’s this girl I used to be friends with, and our history is pretty rocky. To give you some context:

- She used to ditch me constantly for guys.
- She liked the same guys I and my friends have had crushes on after we told her about them.
- She posted rude and hurtful stories about me on her Instagram.
- She ditched me during a really tough breakup I went through.
-She maintained 0 boundaries with my ex despite me repeatedly telling her to quit it

Fast forward to now, I’m planning a day out with some friends (around 10-12 people all mutuals with her). A mutual friend added her to our group with my permission, but I’m having second thoughts. Here’s why:

- I’ve always been the one to forgive her, but I feel like I shouldn’t have to anymore.
- The last time we hung out, I didn’t call her afterwards, and she ended up texting all my friends asking them to invite her to things, claiming she had no issues with me.
- Despite saying she had no issues, she still posted another story about me.
-And the reason she wasn't invited the first time was also because she put stories about me and blocked me on social media 

Part of me wants to be the bigger person, but another part feels like I need to set boundaries and protect my own mental health and I also want to be petty and make her feel the way I did. So WIBTA if I removed her from the groupchat now and exclude her?

73,1cwopgs,AITA for trying to break up my dad and his wife?,"M15. My dad married my stepmom 3 months ago. They dated for like barely 4 months before they married. My mom and him divorced like a few years ago when I was like 11. 

My dad and me don't talk much and I'm tired of fighting to get his attention when he just spends it on my stepmom or his work. He's barely home too. When we do talk he just asks abt groceries and that's it. I tell him he doesn't talk to me much and he's like ""I know it's boring at home but I got you a trampoline you don't have to complain. Life's good rn"". 

I tried finding a way to meet my mom. She lives in another city and she gave her number when she visited one time when I was 12 but whenever I called, she never picked up. I kind of did a crazy thing one day where I tried going to the address where she lived by going w the train but she closed the door on me and told me I needed to go back home as this was violating her boundaries or some shit idk. So yeah she's not an option rn. Maybe never. 

So um my stepmom doesnt listen to me. I love throwing parties 'cause my classmates start thinking im worth talking to all of the sudden. Anyways my stepmom stopped the food from coming and i had to cancel the party. She thinks i dont have a ""parental figure"" to put a handle on me. Does my dad not exist? She is obv not my parent and never was.

So one thing i really hated was that she tried to change my room. She wanted to redecorate it change everything even tho i said i wanted it the way it was. But she changed it while i was at school and i had to sit and sleep in the guest room. I was so pissed. I was telling my dad about it and he told me she had talent in this department and that i should trust the process. Another time it was 3 am and they were drunk on the couch. They thought i was sleeping or somewhere else so i overheard her telling him that he should send me off to some other educational institution to give me a better attitude bec im so closed off and grumpy which was not cool of her to say. Im not a child. So from then i constantly overheard her just talk about my body, my attitude, my parties, my disappearances etc.

So i got enough and i printed a love letter from a random man and kept it in my dads car so he thought she was cheating. But the person that drives my dad to the work told him it was me who put it there so they found out. And now im in trouble and he thinks im dumb for hating her and he just told me that she will avoid me and i will avoid her and just go on like that. He now says any other attempt he will know its just me.

75,1cwoi6y,AITA for not going to my wife's cousins' kid's graduation?,"To give a little bit of background, I (36m) don't know this kid except having seen him twice. He's cool, but we've never had a conversation, and I find it hard to visit with his parents as well. They're also cool, but we just don't have anything in common and I'm a bit of an introvert anyway.

On Saturday morning, my wife (35f) mentions to her mother that her cousin invited us to their son's graduation on Sunday. I cringe a bit because obviously I don't want to go, but shrug it off and resign myself to my fate.

The weekend commences and Sunday morning we're out doing errands. When we get back home, we're very short on time, so my wife is rushing to get ready. While waiting, I realize that this is a graduating class of 120+ kids, outside in the sun, and our 8-year-old son has pretty severe ADHD. It would be a miserable experience for all involved, so I suggest to my mother-in-law, who's waiting on my wife, that it doesn't make sense to drag the kiddo along, and we're gonna just stay home. She agrees that's probably best. A few minutes later, my wife rushes by, and I tell her I'm gonna stay home with our son. She argues on her way out, but by the time our son got his shoes on, they had already left the driveway.

This is where it gets fun! She immediately texts me that she's ""SO fucking pissed"" and ""the house had better be fucking spotless and the shopping better be done"" when she gets home. I try to laugh it off and respond with ""We're about to go to the store but who tf do you think you are lol"" because, yeah, I'm gonna do that stuff, but I'm not her servant and don't deserve to be spoken to that way. She hits me with a ""Fuck off"", so I tell her she's way too angry over this, and I don't deserve this. She says I 100% do because I didn't communicate it to her.

We've had communication issues in the past that I'm actively trying to work through and apologize that there really wasn't enough time. By the way, I told our son to get his shoes, and we were gonna go, but they'd already left, so not much I could have done after the fact.

She proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the night until I went to bed on the couch, when she started texting me about how I was gaslighting her and that my apologies are meaningless, etc. Admittedly, I did tell her she was way too angry, so I guess I did gaslight her some (what I meant was, I don't care how angry you are, you don't need to talk to me like that, but c'est la vie, she won't hear it).

Anyway, it's still going on. I'm at work, and so is she, but she's still finding time to tell me that I'm an asshole and I deserve what she said. She says I made the choice without consulting her first, that we're supposed to be a team. I've suggested that sometimes teams split the workload, like childcare, groceries, and cleaning while the other handles familial obligations, but again, she won't hear it.

76,1cwogie,WIBTA for canceling a trip with my dad ,"I’ve (22M) always had a difficult relationship with my dad (55M). He was very controlling throughout my childhood and he always demanded a lot of attention from me during adulthood. I don’t think he has that many friends and he just wants someone to keep him company. I’m totally fine spending time with him even if it isn’t enjoyable for me but whenever I have dinner with him or talk to him he will never pull away until I tell him I have to go. On the other hand I only see my mom once every 2 months for an hour or two and am happy with that. 

My dad provides for me financially so whenever I don’t do what he says I feel guilty. A few months ago I went on a trip with him to Las Vegas. He told me the trip would be for 2 nights but it was really for 3. I didn’t enjoy the trip and it was honestly awkward because of all of the adult activities that we had to ignore (my dad isn’t a gambling or drinking type).

 I felt bad that we never went on a good trip together like he wanted so a few weeks ago  I suggested to him that maybe we could go to Japan in May because the flights are cheap and I have time off school. I told him I wanted to go with my friends. Later I tell my dad my friends can’t go to Japan but he still insists on going on a trip. Today he booked a week on Maui for just the two of us which I did not agree to. I only have about three weeks left on my lease at my college town and really wanted to spend this time with my friends before they move across the country and I never get to see them. On the other hand, I feel guilty for telling my dad to cancel because he helps me pay tuition.

77,1cwocjp,AITA for not accepting my autistic brother?,"I (22) have an older brother (26) who has autism. He moved away from home to study elsewhere 3 years ago. That was the first time in my life I felt free.

I need y’all to know that I don't hate him because of the autism. I hate him because he's a selfish, spoiled prick, which is probably more cause of how our parents treated him growing up than his autism.

My brother had a temper growing up. If someone else was already in the kitchen when he wanted to cook something he would blow up on that person, if we said something he didn't like he would chew us out. If even the tiniest thing was unlike the way he wanted it to be the screaming would start. He would keep screaming for hours. I didn't feel safe in my home. Our parents would try for hours to calm him. And afterwards, my parents would come to console me (my room was right next to his, they knew I heard everything), but in the end I was the one who consoled them.

Recently my brother have started visiting home more and more. I hate it every time. I still live with my parents cause I don't want student loans, so I don't have a say in whether he visits or not. But my parents keep asking me to do a bunch of stuff for/with my brother. They ask me to loan my bag to him, to drive him places, etc. 

It might be petty, but when we were growing up, and were in the grocery store with our parents. If he wanted something he would always get it. We weren't rich, so if I ever wanted something I wouldn't get it, we couldn't afford it. Because I wouldn't cause a scene.

It's not just that. When I was followed home by some bullies in 9th grade, I locked both the gate (it was a door that led to our front yard, not really a gate ig). When he got home, he yelled at me for locking the ""gate"", because we normally only do that during the nights. I explained the situation to him, thinking he would understand because he was also bullied. But he didn't. It was my fault. I should hurried out of the school. I shouldn't make myself out to be a victim, etc.

I told my parents about my feelings years ago. They hugged me, and apologized for not being better parents to me when I needed them. I'm not mad at them. They did the best they could. What bothered me was when they said: ""He doesn't understand any better"". 

He was home last week. And he's trying, which hurts. He's really trying to engage with me. It makes me confused, I don't know what I'm feeling. Anger, sadness. Cause every time he's home I feel like that little boy I used to be. Sitting under my desk with my hands over my ears, crying, trying to shut out the sounds of my father's and brother's screaming, my mother's crying.

Then I got married, and soon after my marriage my mom decided she no longer wanted to partner with me as a realtor, not bothering to tell me. I had to find out after she listed a home and sold it and decided not to split the commission. Meanwhile, she had been taking the commissions that I had split with her from my sales. Anyway, a couple years later she gets a big listing through a family member, but due to the size and location of the home she felt it was too much for her and asked me to help with the listing. I agreed. But I didn’t help, I did it ALL. I did the photography, I did all the necessary paperwork, I did all the showings, open houses and negotiations. I sold the home above along price and split the commission evenly with her, even though I did all the work. Then a year later that same seller called me directly and asked me to sell another home for him as he was pleased with the job I did on his previous home. After I sold the sellers second home my mom found out and asked for her half of the commission of that sale.

Then I got married, and soon after my marriage my mom decided she no longer wanted to partner with me as a realtor, not bothering to tell me. I had to find out after she listed a home and sold it and decided not to split the commission. Meanwhile, she had been taking the commissions that I had split with her from my sales. Anyway, a couple years later she gets a big listing through a family member, but due to the size and location of the home she felt it was too much for her and asked me to help with the listing. I agreed. But I didn’t help, I did it ALL. I did the photography, I did all the necessary paperwork, I did all the showings, open houses and negotiations. I sold the home above along price and split the commission evenly with her, even though I did all the work. Then a year later that same seller called me directly and asked me to sell another home for him as he was pleased with the job I did on his previous home. After I sold the sellers second home my mom found out and asked for her half of the commission of that sale.

79,1cwobil,AITA for not offering food to a guest?,"I (22M) just moved into a new place with two roommates. All three of us are friends from community college but we have our own friend groups. We decided to have something of a housewarming party together. It was a decent turn out with about two dozen people. 

I made pork lumpia to hand out as small party favors because I had some friends over that love my pork lumpia. I handed a plate of pork lumpia to my roommate (21M). Roommate, Conor, said that it was good but that I shouldn't offer it to his girlfriend's roommate (Rachel) because her last name ended in Stein and she couldn't eat pork. I was confused but I agreed with it becuase I didn't want to offend Rachel. 

Later on in the party it was just me, my roommates, my girlfriend, Conor's girlfriend, and Rachel. Rachel brought up that she saw people enjoying my lumpia and she wanted to try it. I mentioned that I didn't want to make a faux pas and she looked at me confused. I said ""Frank said your last name ended in STein and it would be insulting."" Conor interrupted and asked ""Aren't you Jewish?"" 

Rachel said she was german and said ""That was offensive of you to think that."" 

Conor explained that most Jewish names end in STein. Rachel said ""That's because my father is Erich Frankenstein (not her last name, just changed) and he's from Germany.""

The conversation then started to change into asking if Rachel had any Jewish family members and she said that her family was mainly German. Rachel left the party with a cold shoulder towards me and Conor. Conor' girlfriend apologized on Rachel's behalf to Frank and on Frank's behalf to me. 

Conor's saying that I shouldn't have accepted the apology because it wasn't on his behalf and he genuinely meant well by telling me not to offer pork lumpia.

80,1cwo3is,WIBTA for telling my little sister she can’t remove me from my wedding photo & photoshop herself into my place? ,"My little sister (28f) is recently engaged. I (30 f) got married about 6 years ago (I’ve since divorced and am engaged again). Our mom died 5 years ago, shortly after my wedding. 

At my wedding 6 years ago, the photographer took a photo of my mom fastening a necklace around my neck. My little sister has told multiple people that when she gets married, she plans to hire someone with graphic design skills to remove me from that photo and photoshop herself in my place. So far, I’ve said nothing, but I’ve always felt hurt by that idea and now that she is actually planning a wedding, I am wondering if I should put my foot down. At the same time, I don’t want to add to her pain either. 

Background on prioritizing her feelings/wants leading up to this point: Very shortly after our mom died, all my sisters (including my older married sisters) expressed that they wanted our mom’s engagement ring. As my little sister didn’t get to have our mom at her wedding and the rest of us did get that experience, I urged my dad to hang on to our mom’s engagement ring for our little sister for when she eventually were to get engaged. Ultimately, I was successful in advocating for her to inherit our mom’s ring. Once engaged, she decided to reset the ring so the only part of it that remains is the central diamond—it is a completely different design now and is unrecognizable. We are all a bit miffed by that but what’s done is done. 

Next, we both wanted to use our mom’s wedding dress in our upcoming weddings, but she plans to alter it beyond recognition as it was a long-sleeve, A-line dress and she wants a strapless, mermaid-style dress. I proposed that we each wear it but not make significant alterations, but she brought up that “I’m the only one who didn’t get to have mom at her wedding”, and I do feel for her, so I dropped my bid to wear the dress. 

But at this point, I feel inclined to draw the line at removing me from my own photo with my mom. Yes, I did get to have my mom at my [first] wedding. I won’t have her at my wedding to the person I’ll be spending the rest of my life with, so I’m feeling some sadness there too. If someone is going to be photoshopping someone out of that picture, I feel it should be me photoshopping my 24 year old self out for my 31 year old self. She also has tons of photos with our mom she could use for this purpose instead, as well as photos of our mom solo that no one would need to be removed from. 

 Obviously I can’t force her to not do as she pleases with the photo, but WIBTA if I tell her I’m not ok with that and that she doesn’t have my permission or blessing to remove me from my wedding photo with my mom?

81,1cwnzuy,AITA for fighting with my mom about my grandparents and my step and half siblings in front of my step and half siblings?,"This happened two weeks ago and I was grounded for two weeks (ended yesterday). Mom and I (16m) got into a fight about my grandparents, aka my dad's parents, and my step and half siblings. My dad died 10 years ago. My grandparents were a big part of my life before and after my dad died. But when my mom met her husband and wanted us to all live together, she and my grandparents got into a fight because they refused to welcome her husband's kids into their home with me. My mom didn't even come with me. She was never close to dad's family. I'd go to my grandparents or aunts and uncles houses alone. But my mom insisted her husband's kids should be treated like grandkids and family too and she mentioned she wanted more kids and wanted my family to treat us all the same. My grandparents said no and mom stopped me seeing them for about a year. Then my grandparents sued mom for grandparents rights and won. So she legally can't stop me seeing them and it enrages her. 

I was never upset that my family didn't include my step or half siblings. I liked getting time with them and they were always great to me. Plus mom wasn't ever close to them and never came with me. So it was my time with them.

Mom hates it. She's always hated it. Her husband doesn't like it. And that's because mom and him aren't close to their families so his kids and their kids together don't have grandparents or an extended family. They don't get extra gifts or cool treats with older relatives. And they're so jealous. Mostly my stepsiblings since they're not too much younger. But mom talks enough shit about my family that my half siblings get jealous that they never have grandparents to show up at stuff or to take them to their house. This made mom more determined to get them included by my family.

This led to the fight two weeks ago because mom was mad at me for prioritizing my day with my grandparents over a game one of my half siblings team was playing. I had already changed the day once because of something else and I wanted to see my family more than I wanted to be at the game. Mom started talking shit about my grandparents because she thought they should have showed up with me and been good grandparents to my half sibling. I told mom it wasn't their job. She said I made them all sound like such a chore to love and accept as family. Then she told me it's like I don't even care that they feel rejected. She told me it's like I don't care they lack all the stuff I have. She got really loud and said it was selfish. I yelled back that she acted like I should give a fuck when I don't, because it's not my problem or my issue and I was never bothered by it. It got louder and louder between us and then my step and half siblings were in the house and heard most of it, which upset them. Especially the parts where I didn't care. Which led to me being grounded and my mom saying she doesn't understand me and feels like I'm so selfish and uncaring.

At the rodeo my friend met a boy and they really hit it off. I was happy for her that she was haveing fun and didn't feel any sort of way about her hanging out with him. We ended up all 3 going back to the air bnb. The beds in the air bnb were only separated by a wall, but not closed in. The two of them started hooking up, I think they were trying to be quiet but it was still pretty apparent what was going on and hearing people make out etc. Makes me feel some what uncomfortable. The sounds just makes me feel icky. I gave them some time thinking it would be over soon enough but it was not. I told myself If they weren't done by 2 am I was gonna head home. Home is only half hour drive away. 

I ended up picking up and leaving at 2 am. I asked her friend if he could drive her in the morning, and if he couldn't ill come pick her up. 

Next morning I didn't hear from her when I asked if she needed a ride. Then come to find out she's really angry with me for ""ditching"" her. 

She noted we talked about boys. ( we're both single and talked about finding us some cowboys, did I think this meant we were gonna be brininthem back. No.
I understand that I probably should have just asked them to be quiet but really thought leaving wasn't going to be much of an issue. I figured they could better enjoy themselves and since we were planning on getting up and leaving the next morning anyways, there wasn't much purpose for me to stay.

Let me start off by saying I am a classic middle-aged introvert. The older I get the pickier I am about who I want around me so now that I work at home my human interactions are limited. My mom on the other hand is an elderly— people loving extrovert. She is someone who thrives off of lots of interactions with lots of different people and is extremely patient even among people who I consider to be rude. 

She is a typical extrovert in that she does not believe that being an introvert is actually a  “thing”. When I say I don’t want to she says that I actually don’t really mean it or she thinks that I am just being plain mean when in fact, I require alone time to recharge my batteries so that I can be available for the people I love-like her. 

Of course my mom being happy pleases me very much but why is it that so often the things that please her so much send  me into a panic!

My mother and I both reside about 3000 miles from my childhood home and we have many family members that still live in the town I grew up in. Recently due to a death in the family we are planning a trip back to my childhood hometown and my mother is already planning all of the social interactions with people and wants to include me in all of them and also expects me to involve her in any of my social interactions on the trip, which will be very limited because the trip I think should be focused on supporting our family member that lost a son. 

The thought of having to spend five straight days with my extrovert mother who is planning on spending time with relatives and mostly her friends without having much time to myself alone is sending me into a panic. When I try to explain how this is making me feel my feelings are usually dismissed as being invalid  and she makes remarks  when I try to explain how this is making me feel—my feelings are usually dismissed as being invalid—-she says “once we get there, you will have such a good time around everyone (she is the one who has a great time with everyone) I want mom to be happy and I want to support my relative that lost her adult son so I am not sure how to approach this. I told mom we really need to go to support our relative that lost her child and she agrees, but she is also calling almost everyone she knows in our hometown to tell them we will be there.

How do I tell my elderly mom that I do not have to be involved with every interaction with every social occasion because I need to reserve my energy to be able to care for myself and her ? Or should I swallow my feelings because after all, I am just being a selfish asshole?

85,1cwnin4,"WIBTA for selling the house that my ex and I own together, that she lives in","I (40M) broke up with my ex (43F) over a year ago. She has three kids in high school and grade school. Before COVID, we bought a house together at a great rate. When we broke up, she insisted she and her kids stay in the house, which I felt was unfair. I make enough money to cover the mortgage and offered to let her stay but have her removed from the mortgage, promising not to raise her rent, but she refused, understandably.

Instead, we agreed that she pay me back for my share ($15k deposit, payments up until then, and half the increased value), and we would work to remove me from the mortgage. We agreed to take a year to get our finances in order. If it didn't work out, we would sell the house.

She has managed the mortgage but doesn't qualify to remove my name due to her debt-to-income ratio. Now that the year is up, I want to sell the house so we can each walk away with about $50k and move on.

She is understandably upset, saying I'm kicking her and her kids out and that her rent will skyrocket with no upside for her. I believe she might delay the sale as long as possible.

She has three kids in high school and grade school. Before COVID, we bought a house together at a great rate. When we broke up, she insisted she and her kids stay in the house, which I felt was unfair. I make enough money to cover the mortgage and offered to let her stay but have her removed from the mortgage, promising not to raise her rent, but she refused, understandably.

Instead, we agreed that she pay me back for my share ($15k deposit, payments up until then, and half the increased value), and we would work to remove me from the mortgage. We agreed to take a year to get our finances in order. If it didn't work out, we would sell the house.

She has managed the mortgage but doesn't qualify to remove my name due to her debt-to-income ratio. Now that the year is up, I want to sell the house so we can each walk away with about $50k and move on.

She is understandably upset, saying I'm kicking her and her kids out and that her rent will skyrocket with no upside for her. I believe she might delay the sale as long as possible. From my perspective, if we hadn't met, she wouldn't have the house and would be in the same situation but for a longer period, and without any money to show for it.

86,1cwngrg,AITA for telling my friend with ADHD to back off?,"I (18F) have a friend (18F) who I distanced myself from for about a month or so. 

My friend has ADHD which I’ve tried to be supportive of, however my patience has run out. E.g, every time we planned to hang out at the gym at, let’s say 1PM, I’d end up waiting for an hour minimum. She’d end up arriving at 2PM or even 3PM, meanwhile she only lives 5 minutes away from the gym. This happened more than once. It would be during the winter too so I’d have to wait outside in the cold. 

I brushed this off however and read that a symptom of ADHD was time-blindness, so it made sense. She typically brought up her ADHD, which was understandable. However, from there I stopped making the effort to meet up with her and made this clear with her. She got really upset at me and kept spam-calling me over the weekend (8+ times), saying that she would force me to hangout over the Easter. I ignored all the calls. 

Then I was confronted by her at school, asking why I didn’t pick up her calls anymore (we used to call regularly even though I wasn’t really comfortable with it). I’m used to being a very private person and I hate talking for long periods of time, my social battery runs out really fast. Plus, every time she called, she would always be super toxic towards my interests and tell me to grow up. I ended up telling her that I was busy & I didn’t like calls in general, which is true because even my closest friends respect this, but she took it really personal. 

She screamed at me, asking what I was busy with. I got pissed at this and ghosted her for the next week. She later called 5 times and when I finally answered, she said that I was in the wrong for ignoring her and that I was too sensitive.

She also tends to be super invasive. We’re not super close, otherwise I wouldn’t really have a problem. She snatches my phone all the time, refuses to give it back for over 10 mins and when I try to take it back, she says “what? you have something to hide?” She touches me everywhere and forces me to hug her even though she knows I’m extremely uncomfortable with physical touch.

Growing up, my parents (both in their 50s) were not the best with money.

This led to a lot of stress in my childhood, and I often had to go without things I needed until I got a job and started to pay for them myself.

A few months ago, my parents called me in a panic, saying they were in serious debt and needed help to pay their mortgage. They asked if I could lend them $5000 to help them get back on their feet. I sympathize with their situation, but I know their history with money and am worried they won’t pay me back.

I have loaned them lump sums before and never received a cent back from them. But nothing as big as $5000. Although I could lend it to them out of my savings and it wouldn't impact my month to month expenses.

Jhon proceeded to send screenshots comparing the salaries of mathematicians and businessmen, calling the difference pathetic. When I pointed out that even with a lower salary, mathematicians with a net worth of around $5 million to $200 million could still own a Ferrari, he called me ""dyslexic,"" ""ignorant,"" and ""pathetic,"" changing the subject to focus on me earning a Lambo instead of others.

I responded by saying that I wasn't offending anyone and questioned the sudden attack (though I shouldn't be surprised because he's often like this). He then asked if I could earn a Lambo, to which I replied, *""No, I don't have the intention of owning a Lambo anyway.

We went to the same schools,  lived within a 10 minute walk of each other, went off to university and then moved home at about the same time, we went out to bars as a group, went on vacation as a group, snow board and mtb as a group. Pretty tight.

As each of us has got married we've been in each others wedding parties. Helped organise and paid in.

This continued until the last one of the group got hitched. We did the stag do together. Barry told us that he wanted a small wedding. We all said we'd see each other there. 

However, at the reception it became obvious that three of the group had received all day invitations, and three of us didn't. The three who had been there all day asked why we were so late and when we explained we'd been told it was family only they said they'd assumed something had come up.

It's caused a bit of a split to say the least. Two of the group who weren't invited to the day wedding aren't talking to Barry. I'm still hanging out with Barry and the day invites. The day invites and me and the other two hang out but not with Barry. I took the decision that, although surprised at Barry's decision it is what it is.

However, we recently went out as a group,  missing two, and Barry was banging on about how the two needed to grow up. This was where I might be TA. I told him that he could choose how to organise his wedding but he can't moan about two of the group being offended at the lack of an invitation.

Sadly, my family didn't  take it that well, now all of them are mad at me, a lot of relatives are texting or calling me saying that IATA for leaving, that my great grandmother’s health got worse for the long trip and it was for nothig. I can't even talk to my Great Granny. Some of my relatives are demanding my husband to pay them transportation and unpaid PTO from their jobs. My husband hasn't talked to me about how he is handling these, but I'm starting to feel that I really am the AH for running away, my husband says I'm not.

In June my mom moved out of their shared home because my dad is a narcissist and had gotten worse with me and my siblings as we got older.
between us moving and Christmas he asks if I would be okay with him dating and I wouldn’t mind of course.

4 months later we have our first Christmas apart. One day while me and my siblings (me, my sister 11 my younger brother 8 and  sister 6) are at his house. he stays out very late, I was incredibly worried and couldn’t sleep. Turns out he was just at his “friends”.  

After this I tried to get him to tell me about his girlfriend but he refused, which drives me absolutely crazy. so out of my better judgement while he was gone to the store I did a little snooping just to see like what her name was. I find EVERYTHING and I mean everything notes shes written him from before and most likely from when my mom and him were together of her saying “I’ve always loved you”. 

I find a paper from a jewelry shop from December 30TH with his name on it and the name of a ring. I want to mention something very crucial he’s never paid my mom a cent of child support this entire time, he hasn’t bought us birthday presents, or paid my mom back (she was paying for his insurance until after I found this out) and he doesn’t buy groceries because it’s too expensive. 

the ring he bought for her cost over 3000 dollars. 

In march he proposed to her which I know because one he wears a ring on his ring finger from her and a note from her in march saying she can’t wait to spend forever with him and “till death do us part”  I told this all to my mom and she KNOWS HER. She’s been working with my dad for over a year before my parents split. the fiancé knew about my mom and my dad but she still decided to have a relationship with my dad secretly before they split up. So obviously I hate this woman’s guts 
And I’m extremely pissed at my dad.

I decide it’s not smart to tell him that I know about everything yet i wanted yo see if he was ever going to let me or my brother know (who lives in his house full time and is 27) that he was getting married . he doesn’t tell us absolutely anything for months until I check again and see a note from the fiancé asking what date their wedding should be in October.
he was planning on getting married to his mistress, without letting anyone know especially my brother who’s living situation might chance very soon because of it?

This made me so so angry, anytime I was ever at his house all I could think about was how little he cared for me and my siblings and my hatred for my whole situation just boiled over and I fully just cracked and told him if he gets married to his girlfriend I’m going to change my last name and that I would never go to their wedding his response was “you just don’t want me to be happy” and that “I need to stop being cruel to him” he insists I’m just being mean to him.

I texted them asking why they took it and didn’t give me any kind of heads up or say anything and just kinda generally chewed them out.

The WiFi is in one of their names, and we just venmoed every month for it, including this month.

But I have paid on a monthly basis every month, and they also took it without saying anything. It’s my only day off work this week and I wanted to sit down and watch a movie, and now I can’t. So I’m a little annoyed to say the least. 

Was I right to chew them out? Or were they okay to take the internet.

So, long story short. I (28F) did not attempt to make it to my cousin's (18m) high school graduation. He and I were not close growing up. My mother had to ask his mother (sisters) for help when I was growing up, as she was a struggling single mom. My aunt made good money, had a decent husband, and 2 spoiled children. Every time I went to their house, my other cousin (now 24f) either stole from me, talked me into sneaking out, or just made me really uncomfortable. 

I am not a very social person, and never have been.

Nothing big, nothing fancy, Halloween costumes encouraged, held in my own backyard of the house my bow husband and I bought (no congrats on that either). 

I have sent happy birthday texts to all of them to the best of my ability. I have reached out as an adult and asked for help from my aunt for various things, including just helping my grandmother make it to my wedding. 

No dice. ""Sorry, can't help!"" Every time. 

Now, she is pissed because I didn't reach out to tell him congratulations. I told her that no one reached out for my wedding either, and I didn't make a big deal of that. She blew up and is now holding it over me all the stuff that she did for me growing up. When my mother asked her to. I had no part in it.

This morning, there was a guy playing fetch with his dog.  While I was running the dog took a shit on the field.  The guy cleaned it up.  But it still rubbed me the wrong way.  Like this is a field for sports, not the general public.

102,1cwke1r,AITAH for only letting my sister tag along our Disney vacation if she babysits some nights?,"Im married with a 4 and a 6 year old. I have a sister who is 24. She graduated from college and got a decent first job but got laid off about a year ago and has been living with my parents since. I think she may have had some service industry jobs here and there but generally hasnt worked much in the last year. My wife and I have good jobs but try to be relatively frugal because kids are expensive.

My wife and I are planning a trip to Disney with my SIL (wife's sister) and her husband, and their 5 year old. My wife and her sister are very close and her husband and I are decently good friends these days.

My sister heard about this trip and is really clammoring to go with us. We never went to Disney growing up and she said she's wanted to go forever and really wants to go with us and the kids. She however would not be able to pay her way for the flight/ticket/ and all that. We'd expect to sponsor her it would all in all cost us about 1k. My wife and I talked about it and decided it would be worth it to us if she would help babysit some of the nights so we could have some just adult time. So we offered her this, thinking it was generous but a win win for all of us. 

Long story short she felt otherwise and said were trying to take advantage of her and treat her as a nanny not family. I think this is kinda ridiculous as she's not my kid so in my mind there's not reason to pay for her just because if she's not doing anything to be helpful.

103,1cwk5d9,AITA for excluding my mom and sisters from my second dress shopping?,"

I just really feel bad about this situation but apart of me feels I shouldn’t feel bad but I just can’t help but feel shitty, so I would like to hear other people thoughts.

My mom and sister took me dress shopping and my mom had already given me a budget and told me she was gonna pay for my dress but when we were trying on dresses she was being really rude about everything, my sister were telling her to stop and telling me I looked beautiful but she was just mentioning differentaspects of the dress that made me start to feel insecure especially since all the dresses I stepped out in I felt confident in, the attendant really tried with me but when my mom saw me in the dress she made comments like “that dress really accentuates the fact that you need to loose weight.” “You look short and fat in that dress., that the worst combination” (writing it down, my mom does sound horrible but she just a blunt person not a horrible person)My mom only requirement to buying my dress was that she wanted to experience dress shopping with me but I knew if she went along with me I wouldn’t be happy so I told her I don’t want her to pay for my dress and basically told her that she didn’t need to pay for my dress.

Now am dad girl and I was crying to my dad about not finding a dress and not knowing how am going to afford a dress because wedding dresses are crazy expensive. He told me that it okay and told me he would pay for my dress and took me  shopping, he took me dress shopping with my brother and little cousin (there 14)because my aunt couldn’t get them from school and believe or not I had a really good experience, my dad cried and that was the first time I had ever seen him cry. My brother and cousin were making jokes and complimenting me at every dress, maybe because they don’t know much about fashion so they couldn’t really nitpick. 

I got a dress, adjustment are still going to be made but it my dream dress and am happy with it. I went home with my dad and brother and we tell them we got a dress for me and my sisters and mom look visibly upset. I knew my mom was gonna be upset but I didn’t really expect my sister to be mad at me.

104,1cwjygj,AITA for not giving a dog back,"AITA for not wanting to give back a dog

I (F45 - first time poster, English is my fourth language, apologies for grammatical mistakes) live in an apartment where a neighbour, who is disabled, got a dog 5 years ago. She said the dog kept biting her and everyone told her she needed to give her back. I started to walk the dog once per day and eventually she would also come home with me. This helped the dog to be more at ease at home. During COVID, we took care of the owner, let’s call her Isa (F73 although looks 94) who did not want to go out. She spent a week in hospital and we took care of the dog. From then on, Isa has never left her house, except for me taking her to doctor appointments. My husband does the supermarket for her, I do medical visits and pharmacy/shopping, take care of dog vet visits and grooming, etc. She pays back for vet and grooming. In October 2022 she fell ill and had to be hospitalised for 2 months. I went every day to see her and sent her daily pics of the dog. Since then, she has asked me to keep the dog for her but has not transferred the chip under my name. We go on holidays with the dog and each time she signs a document to allow it. In January of 2024 I was hospitalised for 9 days, I almost died, and since then she has it against my husband, always speaking ill of him. I know she’s in pain and her life is hard (she has friends and family, no kids, but they rarely see her, she tends to be a bit bitter), so I allowed her to trash my husband (he knows about it and doesn’t care) so she could have something to vent about. All other people in the building have stopped speaking to her because she was rude to them. Since nothing came out of her trashing my husband (he continued to be normal around her), she has started to send me nasty messages at least once a week. For example, if I came home after having dinner outside and did not let her know I was home, I will get a bomb message the next day. I go and visit daily, at least for an hour, bring goodies to eat, etc. I know she has started to rely on me too much and I’m ok with that, except that after five months of being treated like crap, I finally told her she needs to start speaking to me in a better tone. She replied saying that it’s best not to see each other for 15 days but I needed to return her dog. I refused. I told her she’s selfish for asking for the dog when she’s been living with me for almost 2 years. Isa can’t walk, her apartment is tiny, there is no light, she can’t play with the dog without needing oxygen afterwards. How can she possibly think she can take her away? At the same time, I think IATA because she’s old and got a dog for company and the dog prefers me. Should I give her back? I live in Europe and I’m not sure about animal law here.

Okay so it all started 2 years ago. It was a saturday (winter) and I (16 female)  was studying for a test when my 3 siblings came up to me and told me that one of our cousins (15 female, let's name her Martha) was calling and texting them non stop which was weird, she was asking why I wasn't anserwing her texts. (You have to know that i was grounded for a week so i couldn't use my phone.) So I opened  facebook on my laptop and I saw that she wanted to invite me for her birthday party. ( i forgot it was her bithday)  So she told me that she wants me to go to her Birthday party, Martha asked me not to bring my any of siblings. She also told me that the party will take place at a restaurant in local town (like 20 minute drive). This was unusuall bc in my family we organize our birthdays at home. Now the tricky part is that Martha texted me at 2pm (I anserwed at 3pm) and her party would start at 4pm THE SAME DAY. So i politely told her that I won't be abke to make it and I will just come to her house the following week. She wasn't really happy about that but she agreed.
An hour later i get a text from my other cousin( let's call her Ashley, 16 yo). She started asking if i was coming to Marta's birthday, so I told her that i wasn't and she was suprised bc apparently Martha has told her that i would be attending a week ago. I thought it was weird bc i never agreed to this and i was invited literally an hour prior. So Asley told me that she also wasn't going to the party, we talked for a bit and we decided that we should come to her house on wednesday.
Now fast foreward to the next day i get a call from Ashley telling me that Martha was shit-talking me and her to our friends and relatives. She told everybody that I was informed ahead of time and that I agreeded to come to her birthday and then suddenly cancelled without a reason, and she was just insulting me and Ashley. Martha's older sister (Laila 16yo) told  Ashley this btw. 
So we got angry and decided that if she wants to shit-talk us like that then we simply won't go to her house. Martha got really upset with us after this and we haven't talked for 2 years after that.

(I feel like i should mention that all the guest at her party were people i didn't know, and her plan for that party wast to eat pizza and cake at the restaurand and then go to the park and smoke and drink IN WINTER, OUTSIDE. )

106,1cwjaaj,AITA for wanting my brother to sign a contract so he pays me back for financially supporting him for just about 3 years.,"About a week ago I (27F) discovered my brother(33M) has been lying to me for 6 months about money that a family member was paying back to us. 
For context we unfortunately lost bother of our parents within a year of each other and we are still dealing with their estates. 

I had asked him to take care of getting back the money that a family member from my mother’s side owed us as paying bills was getting harder and harder for me to do on my own. He said he would handle it and keep me updated.
One day after work it, while I was driving home, I was suddenly reminded of the family member who owed us money. I then got home and asked my brother about it, to which he told me he only received one payment in Dec of 2023 and then nothing ever since. This upset me as I asked why he did not tell me and why he did not give me the money. His excuse was that he forgot and that he had also already used the money. 
This was the start of me not speaking to him as well as I was highly annoyed and disappointed in the whole situation. 

Our estate practitioner then got hold of me a few days later and ironically asked me for some documents from that family member. So being the one who deals with the estate I messaged and for what I needed and then I also asked about the money owed to us. 
It turns out that not only has this person been paying us back but they have been paying us every month since December in small amounts. I was given screenshot of the proof of payments as well as screenshots of the conversations they have had with my brother. 
So he has been actively lying to me since December knowing full well that we have been in financial trouble and it’s been very hard for me to deal with on my own. 

So now I have come to realize that my brother doesn’t hold any real respect or common decency towards me. He has not apologized at all for the situation, offered up any sense of regret or guilt and has rather tried to just go on acting as if nothing happed. This is also despite me leaving home for a few days, no longer messaging him and barely talking to him and even having an intervention for him with some other friends where I told him what I felt about what he did. 

Because of this. I now want him to sign a contract stating he will pay me back for his share of the bills and everything I have been paying for since the passing of our father. I. Also want him to start contributing his share of the monthly bills and should he not then that will also become part of what he owes me.

My cousins don’t exactly have much proper etiquette, but they’re young, so I don’t expect much from them. Well we were all at a basketball court and one my cousins Anthony (16M) said that he needed to pee, so headed towards the grass area off the side of the court, not making much of an effort to hide himself. Well there’s a park nearby and there’s often children running around the area, and a child very much well could see what’s happening. Plus there was women at the court. I stopped him and ran over and told him to go to the actual bathroom. He said the actual bathroom was nasty and unsanitary. I wasn’t making that big of a fuss about it. I just told him to go to the real bathroom if he needs to go, or hold it, but he’s not doing that in front of women and kids. He then heads to the real bathroom with my key. Later he was upset for the rest of the game. He said that I embarrassed him in front of everyone, and he does it all the time and it’s not that big of a deal. My brother Mateo (17M) claims that I was doing too much and that’s just what boys do. I understand that, but men don’t compromise themselves in front of women and children. He’s 16 he should know how to use a bathroom. My other cousin Abraham (19M) claims that they’re going to stop inviting me to this stuff if I don’t chill out, and that ever since I became a medical student I’ve become arrogant.

The situation is the following:

She actually finds one she likes („omg I really really want that one“) and asks me to get it in Fall since she doesn’t want to get tattooed in summer.

115,1cwhvkp,AITA for telling my stepmother she's not second best/a consolation prize because she's not in the running? ,"My dad and my stepmother got married when I was 9 and I'm 17 now. They have 3 kids together. My mom died when I was 8 but my parents were already divorced and I think my dad was already dating my stepmother at that point. Either that or he/they rushed the relationship because they assumed I would need a new mom because mine died. It was a crazy af time.

My dad and stepmother decided we needed therapy together because she was struggling and wanted to communicate some stuff to the two of us that she had not before. In therapy she started off talking about how she feels like she's second best or a consolation prize with me. She feels like I see her as less than a parent, less than a mother, and it hurts. She talked about marrying my dad expecting we would be so close and how she believed a newly motherless child would need someone else to fill in. But that the whole time we've known each other she feels like I do nothing but compare her to mom or dismiss her in favor of mom and leave her in second place a lot. She said she wanted to be more important to me than that. She wanted to mom in my eyes. She didn't want to feel like I would gladly toss her aside if my mom came back. I'll say now, in therapy she was called out for that. She was told it was cruel to toss that in my face when I'm old enough to be aware my mom is never coming back.

She spoke for several sessions about feeling second best/like the consolation prize and like I don't care for her at all. She brought up how I never hug her or how I correct anyone who mistakes her for my mom. Another thing was the fact I have never said I love you to her, she noticed that and she said many times she waited and waited for me to say it but it never came. She talked about how every mention of my mom hurts her down to her core because she can hear how much I love my mom. She admitted to hating my mom, to wanting to wave a magic wand and have me forget her so she's not coming in second to her always. There were lots more things said too.

I was asked to address what she said for several sessions. But I knew it might come across as cruel if I did. So I refused to engage. But my dad kept pressing me on the issue and the counselor was trying to reassure me that I would not be penalized for speaking up. After a lot of pressing and then my stepmother got involved and told me to speak because we needed to work through this and she needed me to acknowledge her feelings and work on us coming together, I was honest. I said she was never second best or a consolation prize because she was never in the running. I never saw her as mom, I never considered her to be a possible new or second mom. I never ever looked at her in that way or wanted her to be that for me. And that she was always competing against my dead mom for nothing.

My dad and stepmother were so angry after I said all this. Two weeks later and it was mentioned in therapy but they're still furious with me.

116,1cwhs54,AITA for refusing to clean the mess my mother made after I spent a whole day deep cleaning the house?,"Hi everyone, I (21F) am feeling really frustrated and could use some perspective on whether I'm in the wrong here.

Last Thursday, my mother (42F) had a minor operation (uterine polyp removal). Since she was going to be resting, I decided it was a perfect time to do a deep clean of the house. I woke up early at 7 AM and started cleaning immediately. Around 9:30 AM, I had to rush to the vet because my cat wasn't feeling well, but I was back home and cleaning again by 11:30. I spent the entire day cleaning, only taking a break to make dinner, and finished everything by 6 PM.

When my mother came back at 7 PM, she was very happy with the job I had done. The next day, she decided to do her version of a ""deep clean,"" which involved remaking the beds and mopping the floor, while complaining the whole time.

By Sunday, I had managed to keep the house clean since I work from home and was very proud of my efforts. However, my mother decided to make a video recipe for her YouTube channel that day. The kitchen was left in an absolute mess—dirty floors, a sink full of pots and basins, and spots everywhere. I wasn't feeling well, so I went to bed early that night.

This morning, I woke up to the disaster in the kitchen. I was so overwhelmed and couldn't believe my eyes. All my hard work was undone, and it looked like it would take me hours to clean everything up again. So, I made myself a coffee and went back to my work, leaving the mess as it was.

When my mother came back from work, she started attacking me for leaving the kitchen in such a state. I bit back, telling her it was her mess and that I felt disrespected after all the hard work I had put in to keep the house clean. She replied that it's my job to clean since I work from home. This isn't the first time I've had to clean up after her (she works as a cook and has people to clean after her at work).

I know she isn't going to clean it, and I’ll probably end up doing it tomorrow, but I wanted to stand my ground for once. So, AITA?

  
UPDATE: I clean it. Not for her but for me, I know that if I don't clean it it's only gonna get worse, and I'm the one who's gonna suffer in the long run. Anyway, I appreciate all your comments and suggestions. I told her that the first thing chefs/cooks learn is how to clean up after themselves. She just laughed and said that a chef doesn't clean somebody else does it for him.

117,1cwh2ne,AITA for not helping my roommate after she broke her leg?,"I (18F) just finished my freshman year of college. I met my roommate, Emily (18F), online through a college page.

We have similar hobbies, but completely different majors. She’s more decisive and I’m permissive. Emily also has issues with her leg which she should be wearing a sleeve for, but stopped during the first semester.

In March of this year, our school held a roller skating night and a couple of friends invited us. A couple laps in, Emily started to complain her leg was hurting. No matter how much we told her to sit down, she wouldn’t. When we were on our last lap of the night, Emily fell and couldn’t get up because of how much pain her leg was causing her. Campus safety was called and they drove us back to our dorm.

I was very accommodating of Emily. I picked up her lunch and walked her to classes that were upstairs (Most buildings don’t have elevators). Originally, she was told her leg was sprained, but her parents drove several hours and took her to a doctor, who told her it was broken.

After she received the proper treatment from a doctor, she started to complain more about the campus' and students' accommodations. While I would walk her back from classes, she would loudly comment about people that would pass us and belittle people that offered her help. She also labeled herself as disabled, which really bothered one of our friends because Emily would make rude comments about their disabilities. I will admit, I brushed over these comments at the time because I wanted to see the best in her. A month or so ago, Emily yelled at us because we entered the dining hall without her. I made them talk it out so we were fine for a while. Then I realized that should never apologized throughout the whole conversation. She also would express concern that I am going to choose our friends over her. I tried to make her feel better.

My breaking point came during roommate selection for the upcoming school year. On Monday before it was due, Emily called one of our friends and mentioned how she might room with another girl if they didn't get a single. I had heard nothing about this, and wasn't really listening to their phone call. I was under the assumption we would room together because that is what Emily told me the week prior. On Tuesday, the three of us were studying for a test, without Emily, so I couldn’t pick up her lunch. On Wednesday, I saw that Emily had removed me from our housing group, so I asked her if she was rooming with the other girl and she said yes. That is when I started to sob and call my mom because I didn’t understand why, now, only two days before selection was due she was telling me this. In that moment, all empathy for Emily was gone and everything she had done in the past started to make sense.

Since then I haven’t tried to talk to Emily or help her in hopes that she would reach out first. It took her almost a week to text me that we are still roommates. Once again, not apologizing.

I had heard nothing about this, and wasn't really listening to their phone call. I was under the assumption we would room together because that is what Emily told me the week prior. On Tuesday, the three of us were studying for a test, without Emily, so I couldn’t pick up her lunch. On Wednesday, I saw that Emily had removed me from our housing group, so I asked her if she was rooming with the other girl and she said yes. That is when I started to sob and call my mom because I didn’t understand why, now, only two days before selection was due she was telling me this. In that moment, all empathy for Emily was gone and everything she had done in the past started to make sense.

Since then I haven’t tried to talk to Emily or help her in hopes that she would reach out first. It took her almost a week to text me that we are still roommates. Once again, not apologizing.

118,1cwgqc0,AITA for telling my stepdaughter she can take a break from college without running it by her parents,"I have a 20 year old stepdaughter. Ive known her since she was 8 and I know she’s very smart but school isn’t her thing. I knew it wasn’t her thing when she was in high school but she tested high enough to get by. 

Now she’s in community college. Her first 3 semesters really fucked with her mental health. She was a stem major and didn’t want to believe that it wasn’t for her so she did it until she got to the point where she stopped sleeping and eating from the stress. 

I talked her into changing her major to early childhood education. She’s been working at a daycare for 2 years and loves it. She seemed relieved about the change of major for a minute but when school started again she was still feeling defeated and had no self confidence. As a result of that she didn’t do well this semester either. 

On Saturday she came into my room shaking like a leaf and had tears streaming down her face. She was either failing or barely passing all of her classes and was in a really bad place mentally. The first thing I suggested to her was quitting her job but she shut that down immediately. She says her job is the only thing she has making her feel good about herself and that she needs it so my next suggestion was taking a break from school, maybe the summer and fall, and she can focus on herself and address her mental health, hopefully with a psychologist. Going into the semester feeling defeated and that she can’t do it isn’t going to help her. 

She liked that idea and told her dad that she was going to take some time off to focus on herself. He asked who told her she can do that and she said I did. Now he’s mad at me for telling her to take a gap semester to get therapy and gain some self confidence before she goes back to school and says I should’ve talked to him or her mom before I said she can do that. He’s talking about making her pay rent while she’s not in school and got mad when I told her I’ll pay for her because I really want this time to be about her and helping her now so she doesn’t have a breakdown at the end of every semester.

Now, we have white carpets everywhere (it’s the UK, so carpets are common) and a white sofa. Our cat has white fur, so we had no choice in picking the sofa and carpet color.

Our friends have a large, untrained black dog. The last time they visited our rented property, the dog did his business in every corner, did number two in the middle of the room, and drooled all over our sofa. He also terrorizes our cat every time they meet. Like many pet owners, our friends believe their dog is an angel.

But this is now our own house, and we paid a lot for the sofa and carpets. We also don't want our cat being scared in his own home.

I should mention they always take their dog everywhere with them and they are our very close friends. 

We asked them to come to the housewarming party without their dog. (Their parents live nearby, so leaving the dog for a day shouldn’t be too much of a hassle.)

They are now mad at us for being heartless and it seems that they don’t want to continue our friendship.

The house is causing issues for my finances now and I have had multiple people reach out to me to sell. I also want to sell it since I am tired of seeing the home, it just reminds me of my mom and that she is gone. So being a landlords isn’t good for my mental health.

So I decided to sell, I informed my daughter that they have 6 months to find a new place. This started an argument, she apparently put in a lot of upgrades such as redoing the stairs, kitchen and are in the middle of the bathroom. That I are screwing them over and that now the house is worth more.

We’re all college seniors and have been in the same friend group throughout college. We bonded freshman year over our love of soccer- we all played in high school. Of the three of us, Aaron is kind of the only one who still stays fit. He goes to the gym about 6 times a week, eats super healthy, and barely drinks. Dylan and I have more of the party lifestyle, and we’ve both gained weight as a result, although both of us are totally fine with that. I’m 5’11 and weighed around 160 freshman year, but am now 190.

A few nights ago Dylan and I came back from a party and were hanging out drinking beer. Dylan made some joke about how much weight he’s gained and how thin he used to be and I said something like “if you don’t have a beer gut by senior year of college you didn’t have enough fun.” Dylan made a stupid comment about how only the people who don’t get invited to parties stay fit. 

Aaron walked in at some point and heard us joking. He said he was hurt that we basically called him unpopular since he stays fit and doesn’t have a beer belly like us. The thing is, Aaron does get invited to parties, he just generally chooses not to go. This party that we were at happened to be one that he wasn’t invited to, and Dylan and I assumed that he wouldn’t want to go, so we didn’t ask him.  He said that we were just lazy for getting beer guts and he still has fun while maintaining his fitness routine. It was our choice to let ourselves go and get fat, and we were gonna regret it after graduation. This pissed me off, so I said that he only cares about how he looks and that’s why he doesn’t get invited to more stuff. Now we’re all just mad at each other. I’m not embarassed that I’ve gained weight, but I definitely think Aaron was out of line calling me and Dylan fat.

I’m not saying that Aaron needs to stop being so healthy, I just think that it’s his own fault he has less friends than me and Dylan, since he spends so much time on his routine. He’s too uptight, and that’s why people gravitate towards me and Dylan over him. I think he needed the wake up call.

126,1cweskd,AITA for not further funding my uncles medical expenses ,"Hi All,

Thank you for reading this

I 22M just graduated university last year and am working full time. Through my university years (4) I worked my ass off doing jobs in hospitality and call centres. I even did full time load of study and full time work for a couple of semesters (thanks to covid both uni and work was full time WFH).

An unfortunate tragedy had occurred in my family where my uncle fell from a couple of stories which lead him to the hospital where he currently is.

I am more than happy to help out my family in need and I did. It started with couple of thousands then eventually kept going up. 

Right now I have contributed 45k of my own hard earned money towards him . Then again I am happy to put money for my family but what really angers and upsets me is this individual that I am paying for my uncle has barely held a full time job in his life and is 60 years old and has no savings. Any money that is even touched by his hand goes towards alcohol and that has been happening since he was young.

I am been guilt tripped too much and it was my dream to get my house and start investing early in my future hence why I worked hard.

I am losing savings gradually but thankfully due to my younger self for working so many hours I am fine but I have been in the negative cashflow position since January this year and never in my life have I been negative as I am frugal.

My dad keeps saying “what will you do with a house will you leave your whole family behind” and I keep stating how much is enough i have contributed already 45k how further will this go.

My father is not a high earner yet even average I am ashamed that a university from a graduate program will out earn him but I digress.

Tldr: spent 45K on alcoholic uncle medical expenses and being gaslit that I am being wrong and unjust despite me working very hard to be in this position.

Thank you all that reply and I apologise for any typos and poor grammar ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-20,"AITA for not further funding my uncles medical expenses  Hi All,

I (25F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been dating for 3 months. He is a minor celebrity(?) and often does fanservice for his fans. He claims that it will bring in more fans to support his band (he started a couple of months ago). However, I think it crosses the line sometimes. For instance, he asked fans to kiss him on the cheek through a call. Albeit over a fancall, it made me feel a little uneasy. Surely he can provide fan services without all this kissing? I guess a heart is okay, I'm even okay with him blowing kisses to his fans, or wearing revealing clothing at performances! But asking his fans to kiss him and even putting his cheek up to the camera, pouting when the fans refuse to kiss him... it breaks my heart really.

After the fancall I blew up at him and he didn't agree with me, claiming he 'had to' as it was 'part of his job.' I don't get it.

I threatened to break up with him but he says I'm 'overreacting' and 'the only one in his heart'. Unfortunately we are staying in the same apartment and if I really do leave him, it makes things more complicated as I may potentially end up homeless.

129,1cweme6,AITA for not inviting my sister to game with my friend and I,"A few months ago I (26f) asked my friend (25f) if she wanted to play Minecraft together. We’ve been friends for 8 years and lived together in college, but now can usually only hang out remotely since we live a few hours apart. It’s been a few years since we were into it, but Minecraft has been fun way for us to hang out since we can just chat, listen to music, and build or something.

When we played a few years ago, we ended up inviting my sister (25f) to join us because we thought she would like it. She did and we spent many hours in that world before eventually all losing interest. My friend and my sister are friends as well since I introduced them several years ago when we all started playing D&D together (which we still do every other week). 

When I asked my friend to play a few months ago, I didn’t also invite my sister because I’ve found it’s important to spend time with friends one on one. If I only ever see a friend when we hang out as a group, the friendship fades a bit in my experience. Doing so wasn’t a secret and my friend mentioned us playing together while we were all playing D&D one night. My sister acted hurt that she hadn’t been invited, to which I said something like “I hang out with you alone, I’m allowed to do that with my friends, too.”

For context, I see my sister constantly. She’s my best friend and we grab dinner, see movies, game, etc. all the time. It’s not as if I don’t want to see her. But I did want the chance to hang out with my friend in a similar way. 

My sister kept acting hurt any time Minecraft was mentioned so we did eventually invite her to join us, but she just acted bored the whole time. Later on I talked about it with my friend and she guessed that my sister had lost interest since she hadn’t been a part of our Minecraft world at the start.

Now, half of those people decide not to tell me they wouldn't remain the night out, but simply leave during the afternoon. From twelve people we should be, we remained in five, plus Micheal (we will call him that), that left around 3 AM since we were near his house.

I wasn't that happy, because some of the people who left were friends I would had considered quite close, so I remained with my bestfriend Norman, my girlfriend and other three people I never spoke so much with. I end up doing a so called secondary mission with Micheal, as he had a license, that took me with his car and made me grab something to eat or I would had drunk on empty stomach all the night and probably would had died. He kind of reassured me because we joked around, made me laugh a lot, and I genuinely thought the night was going much better.

When me and Micheal came back with food, we found something I never thought would had happened. Apparently, Norman and an other dude from the group decided to shit on edge street and make a draw on a canvas my girlfriend took with her, and to travel around all the night with this thing. I wouldn't had been so pissed off if it didn't smell so bad I threw up.

So yeah, I end up getting mad because I was away for like 10 minutes and they managed to do the most outrageous thing, and we spend like one hour arguing about the fact that they could had avoided doing such thing, and so it just remained me, Micheal and my girlfriend while the other got away with the canvas full of shit.

131,1cwehfe,AITA for Using the Empty Seat Next to Us?,"My partner (47M) and I (38F) recently flew overseas, coming home from vacation. 7 hour flight, daytime. We booked the emergency exit row for the leg room in advance, and paid the extra for it. I was in the window seat, my partner in the middle seat (his request)

The plane wasn’t quite full, there were seats available here and there. 

After we settled in, but before boarding was over, we overheard a man ask a flight attendant if he could move to the empty seat next to my partner. The FA said that boarding wasn’t over and he would have to wait until it was, and take off was done to change seats. This man wasn’t exceptionally tall, under 6 ft, and was in a middle seat of a 4 seat section, with no one to one side of him.

Not wanting my partner to be cramped in the middle with someone next to him (those seats are actually less comfortable than regular ones as the arm rests are solid and it wedges you in with no room to adjust yourself, but you do have all the legroom you could need), I whispered to him to move over to that seat when the seatbelt sign turned off, and we’ll put our bags/books on the seat in the middle. 

My logic was… none of us paid for that extra seat, so it’s up for grabs for anyone equally, and we can get to it first. And arguably, we paid extra for comfort and the other passenger did not.

Once we found a place I rented out my apartment and have been slowly moving out all my personal belongings to the new place.
I've done 2 carloads of her stuff and offered to do more multiple times but she said no. 
Moving day all I had left was the big stuff and a single carload.
Movers came grabbed the big stuff and I went to the apartment ready and waiting. 
Asked where they are and didn't get a response via Facebook or text. 
She showed up very upset that I hadn't helped her all day. 
I'd just assumed like me she'd been incrementally moving things but she'd basically just boxed everything and had dozens of boxes that needed moving. 

Parts where I think I'm not the asshole:
Move was Sunday and the Friday before when I was out of my apartment she insisted we go to her friends house for pizza.
I was designated driver but she stayed up until 2am, agreed to sleep at theirs, slept in and by the time we were home it was late afternoon. 

I've explained to her that leaving the packing until the last day wasn't my idea and if we had of spent Friday night then all of Saturday setting up the kitchen and cupboards the move wouldn't have gone so badly.

I was designated driver but she stayed up until 2am, agreed to sleep at theirs, slept in and by the time we were home it was late afternoon. 

I've explained to her that leaving the packing until the last day wasn't my idea and if we had of spent Friday night then all of Saturday setting up the kitchen and cupboards the move wouldn't have gone so badly. 
Also if you're wondering where someone is you've got a phone check it or give them a call.

136,1cwd7oz,AITA for telling my wife her birthday gift is a door?,"I (26 M) and my wife (21 F) were supposed to take our 9 month old daughter to a (my side) relative's 1 year old birthday party. We ended up missing it because we forgot about it until the time where it was supposed to start and I was out with some friends when I remembered. I texted my wife that we forgot about the birthday and she started blowing up my phone and texting asking what time it starts and telling me we can still make it and to pick her up. I declined her calls and texts since I was busy helping my friends and couldnt leave as I had already committed to helping them. About 2.5 hours later on my way home I called her back and she started screaming at me about how selfish I was and that she really wanted to go and get to know the lady that invited her because she wanted to make some friends and that she's always lonely. She said it was my fault because she reminded me ""multiple times"" to ask for the exact time from my cousin but I never did. So I told her we can just drop off a gift on our way to her parent's house since we were supposed to go there at the time I would get home anways. When she told me that the party would be over by now anyways I stated that I was told the party ends at 5 (it was 2:30 when I remembered the birthday and 4:45 when I headed home). When she heard this she went ballistic on me and shut in my face after telling me I ""had all this time to make it and take her but instead ignored all her texts and calls because I wanted to spend extra time outside"". She said that I was only supposed to be gone for 2 hours but instead stayed out for almost 5 hours and didnt even have the courtesy to let her know. 
I got super upset but when I came home I tried to act nice to her and when she got annoyed that I kept persisting she said ill be pissed when I find out what happened anyways. I asked her what she meant and she showed me the supply closet door had a big crack in it. She said it was an accident when she kicked the door shut cause she was upset so I told her to pick which one of her things I should break to teach her a lesson. She said she wont let me break her things and then we left the house and stopped by her doctor on the way there. After she came back she apologized for ""acting crazy"" and breaking the door. Her 22nd birthday is 5 days away and I was supposed to buy her an expensive gold bracelet that she knew about but instead I told her ""its fine, I know what I'm getting you as a birthday gift now though, its a door"".

137,1cwd518,AITA for how I reacted to graduation?,"I (21F) just graduated from college. My family came to celebrate, and I had to move out of my dorm by noon the next evening. I had a tough time in high school, and college is where I really found my people---both socially and academically. This includes my best friend since freshman year---Olive, who lives across from me in the dorms.   
We were close to done loading the car when I noticed Olive's room was empty. I texted her. She didn't respond. My brother said that he thought she had left already. I really tried to keep it together, but I was so scared that she had left without saying goodbye...I don't know. It all hit me really hard at that moment, and when I got back upstairs to bring down my last bags, I was really trying to hold myself together, but I couldn't breathe. It felt like everything was underwater.  
However, this really upset my mom. She started screaming at me and telling me I was being selfish, wasting everyone's time by crying, and that crying wouldn't change whether Olive left or not. I tried to tell her to give me one minute just to catch my breath, but she just kept yelling at me. I tried apologizing and grabbing the last of my stuff to take downstairs, but she was just so mad. It got so bad that my aunt had to pull her friend into the other room to cool down.  
We were not late or anything like that. I know she was anxious to get my brother to his soccer game, but we were home about three hours before he had to leave for the field. I did cry the day before after graduation (after saying goodbye to a few professors who were really important to me---I waited until they left and went into the bathroom so I didn't make a scene). I also cried when I got in the car after saying goodbye to Olive, who did not leave campus, but we had a very emotional goodbye.   
I know it was annoying that I was crying, especially because this was the second time since graduation. Olive also hadn't even left yet, so it was stupid that I was upset. I think it might have been a panic attack. I used to get them in high school. My mother would react similarly if I had one in front of her growing up.  
I don't know if I'm in the wrong. While I do think that maybe my Mom's reaction was unreasonable, I have also been causing her to react this way for just as long.

140,1cwcszf,WIBTA if I asked a neighbor to take care of their trash. ,"Spouse and I moved to a new home in the last year. In that time, we've learned that a few of the homes in the area are treated as rentals, while most are owner occupied. One house adjacent to us is a rental, as is the one immediately following (both apparently owned by the same family that is not local to this state--which we only found out through the builder). 

We've gotten to know some of the neighbors, say hi, know their names, etc., but we tend to mind our business. We just keep it friendly.

Our immediately adjacent neighbor is a renter and moved in during winter. We seem to have pretty different schedules and I never ran into her until a few weeks ago. We finally introduced ourselves and had a brief chat about the area (she had questions about the neighborhood). Perfectly pleasant convo: I learned she's from NYC and lives here with her two children (middle school aged).

The issue: For MONTHS she has left enormous cardboard boxes, flattened and propped up against her house in the very narrow alley between our homes. That alley belongs to that property, and there is no fence dividing the properties between the houses. About 3 weeks ago (the same week we met) she also left a garbage bag next to the degrading cardboard boxes, in the open and not inside the garbage bins on the property. The garbage bag has clearly been ripped open and I'm starting to get worried about pests. Our front entrance is right by this alley so we literally see this garbage every time we use the front door. I can't say the garbage smells, I'm not sure if it's just paper/plastic waste, but it's attracting some kind of animal.

We haven't once seen those bins or garbage taken out. I'm not even sure what she's doing with her household garbage because there's no way a family of three have only produced that one bag of garbage in the months they've lived there. She confirmed that they live there full-time so I doubt it's that they're only here some of the week. But because I've never seen the bins on the curb, I'm worried this is just going to go on forever.

I've been considering leaving her a note since I rarely see her. I also thought that might be less aggressive than knocking on her door for the express purpose of calling her out on this. But I also realize we don't have much of a relationship and it's technically her property, so maybe I just need to back off? I'm not trying to sour the start of a neighborly rapport.

The thing that prompted this was a disagreement we had while visiting the Natural History Museum in London. The disagreement was me asking if after I had enjoyed the museum to my satisfaction could I head back to the place we're staying at? We only have one key to get into it, and it requires lengthy bus and/or subway rides to get to the room from the museum. The reason I asked is because my parents mentioned allowing me to stay at the room for the day after this since the place my Mom really wanted to visit this trip was a place we all knew I wouldn't enjoy even slightly, and I appreciated that. So the compromise was that I borrow the key since we only have the one as I would need to learn how to use it anyways if I was to get food while my parents were enjoying themselves.

What confused me was that despite trying to offer this compromise, they both rejected it outright. Their reasoning was, as far as I can tell, effectively ""you're already at the place you wanted to visit, stop complaining"". Now the reason that I wanted to leave the museum earlier than my parents is because they wanted to spend the entire day there to really ""learn"".

Dad responded by going off on how it was a chore to bring along a whiny brooding child on vacation, and Mom just rolled her eyes at me.

142,1cwcpe1,AITA for wanting to buy my parents car?,"Sorry for bad grammar as I learned English off internet. The prices are in the local currency of my country, if you want the prices in USD please divide by 100.

I’m 23f and I have a car (Toyota Celica from the year 2004) that my parents bought for me 5 years ago as a birthday present for my 18th birthday (in my country you can only have a driving license when you turn 18). It was bought for 320 000 rubles back then and now it’s worthy of 750 000+. It’s in stock condition (no aftermarket bumpers, custom paint jobs or any other shitty mods) and if I invest 100 thousands rubles more (paint job, electrical work, stuff like that) it’ll be worth about a million.

In 2015 my parents bought a brand new Subaru Forester (idk the initial price) that is now worthy of 1,5-1,8 millions of rubles. They’re not planning to buy a newer car anytime soon, but in a year I’ll graduate from the university and I want to upgrade a car. I don’t want to buy a brand new car, but I’m interested in buying the Forester of my parents.

Now we have 2 options:

1 - using the trade in program and switching the Forester for idk what (my dad wants to have a Subaru Outback), my car isn’t eligible for trade in because it’s more than 15 years old and they will offer a smaller price because those cars (old JDM models) are only worthy to people who are into this sort of cars

2 - selling my car for let’s say 850 thousands and putting this money into the loan for a new car, I will also be contributing towards the loan with paying a half of monthly payments from my salary when I’ll get a job. Also in this situation I will be able to keep the Subaru car. I like it because it’s newer than the car I have now and it’s also bigger

My parents are not planning to get rid of the Subaru or buy a new car anytime soon, but I talked to my mom about it and she said she would want to trade in the Forester.

The question is will I be the asshole if I persuade them into option №2? I already had a bad experience with dealing with my parents about car matters, basically when they were buying a Forester they had a Subaru Outback (year 2001) and they sold it for 200 thousands. If they didn't sold it, when I turned 18 I could already have a car that was cheaper than the car I own (they gained 200 thousands but had to spend 320 thousands 4 years after). I asked them to not sell it, but they didn’t listen because I was a teen, and eventually they had to spend more money, even including the tax for the car (it would be around 5000 rubles for 4 years and the other expenses would make around 10000).

Sorry for bad grammar as I learned English off internet. The prices are in the local currency of my country, if you want the prices in USD please divide by 100.

I’m 23f and I have a car (Toyota Celica from the year 2004) that my parents bought for me 5 years ago as a birthday present for my 18th birthday (in my country you can only have a driving license when you turn 18). It was bought for 320 000 rubles back then and now it’s worthy of 750 000+. It’s in stock condition (no aftermarket bumpers, custom paint jobs or any other shitty mods) and if I invest 100 thousands rubles more (paint job, electrical work, stuff like that) it’ll be worth about a million.

In 2015 my parents bought a brand new Subaru Forester (idk the initial price) that is now worthy of 1,5-1,8 millions of rubles. They’re not planning to buy a newer car anytime soon, but in a year I’ll graduate from the university and I want to upgrade a car. I don’t want to buy a brand new car, but I’m interested in buying the Forester of my parents.

143,1cwcnvb,AITA for taking to my school director,"I've been studying at the same private school for 13 years, where my mom is the headmistress. This school isn’t great; it’s run by wealthy but uneducated directors. I’m 16F currently taking my exams. The exam center is close to my school, which is an hour's drive from my house, so I wait at the school after exams until my mom can leave so we can save on petrol by traveling together. While I’m at school, my teachers ask me about the exams so they can estimate thresholds and identify key topics for future exams. I also collect feedback from my classmates and share it with the teachers.

On friday, at the last moment my mom was asked to stay late for an interview at school without being told beforehand. She wasn’t being interviewed but had to wait because she’s the headmistress. I stayed in our car with my dad for 1.5 hours in the heat(our car's AC doesn't work). I was exhausted and furious. When I went to check on my mom, I found out the interview hadn’t even started, and she had been waiting outside the meeting room all that time. I was worried because I needed to get home and study for my next exam.

My mom had been trying to call the vice principal to find out when the interview would start and end, but she wasn’t answering. When one of the directors and her assistant came out, I politely asked them when the interviews would be over, knowing my mom would never. The assistant told me they were already done. I told my mom, and she was upset that I had spoken to them. She’s not very confident and had warned me not to say anything, fearing repercussions.

On Monday, my mom told me she’d been yelled at by the principal because I had spoken to the director. The principal said that if I was so worried about my exam, I should have gone home with my dad, despite knowing we can’t afford the extra petrol for two long trips. They’ve also refused to provide transport for my mom in the past when she’s had to stay late. I felt terrible for causing trouble for my mom, but I didn’t think asking a simple question would lead to this.

The school often tells me that my mom is just my mom at home and my teacher at school, but they don’t apply the same rule. They treated me as the headmistress’s daughter, not just another student. I know I was exhausted and the heat got to me, but I was respectful when I spoke to the director. Some people I’ve told this story to think the principal overreacted and shouldn’t have said horrible things to my mom over such a minor incident. It seems like the director exaggerated what happened to the principal.

144,1cwcmni,AITA for Excluding my practically sister from my bridal party,"AITA for Excluding my practically sister from my bridal party

Context: I have 1 older bro (2 years older) 2 younger bros and a little sis (7, 9, and 13 years younger respectively) Despite the age gap, my sis and I are very close, we even shared a room until I moved out when I was 20.

My house growing up was ALWAYS full of friends of the family. There were at least 9 people any day and maybe more on the weekends, my point being there were a lot of people going in and out at all times. My sis has a best friend named Beth and they have been friends since kindergarten (7 years) I have only met Beth maybe four of five times.

My older bro got married when he was 24 and the wedding was beautiful. Now I'm 26 and recently married but there was some unexpected drama. It started when I was going over my bridal party with my mom and she got upset that Beth and Hannah weren't in it. Who's Hannah? Turns out Beth has a little sis who hangs out at my parent's house all the time (she's 10) I have never met her. So why would she be at my wedding at all let alone in my bridal party? Well, my mom has basically become a second mother to these girls and sees them as family and can't grasp why I would want to exclude them on my special day? My mom decides Beth can be a bridesmaid and Hannah can be the flower girl. Except I don't know either girl and my then fiancé's niece was already slated to be the flower girl. My mom and I go back and forth for a while before I leave.

I do some digging because it seemed weird to me that my mom would be so stubborn about just these girls and not the rest of my little sib's friends and I find out that the girls' parents are divorced, they don't get along with their step-mom, their dad is out of state caring for his dying father and the mother was recently diagnosed with MS. I feel really bad for these poor girls because our family has become their safe place. I relent and say that they can come to the wedding but they can not be in the bridal party or official family photos. My mom is livid! She can't fathom that I wouldn't want to give these 2 girls the world on a platter and tells me that she already told Hannah she was going to be a flower girl and Hannah is so excited If I don't let her I will be crushing her dream and I simply can't do that to a child who has been through so much!

Fiancé and I remain firm that they can come, but they are not going to be part of the bridal party. Our wedding comes and all is well until at the reception when Hannah comes up to me and wants to know why I changed my mind and didn't have her as my flower girl. She said it was a dream she had always had and now she would never get the chance. I tried to be polite as I could, but she still cried and told me I was mean.

146,1cwc5ey,AITA for prioritising my health over my friend’s birthday?,"I (26f) have a friend (34f). It was her bday 25/04 but I’ve not been well so didn’t see her around her bday. I sent a nice message first thing on her bday because I knew I couldn’t be there/afford a present. She is calling me a shit friend, ignorant, selfish, says I should be embarrassed, I wallow & my heads up my arse.
Why I didn’t tell her I was unwell until she questioned me not seeing her:
1. She’s often ill & doesn’t let me know she’s unwell. If I text while she’s ill her partner texts me to tell me while she’s on Facebook sharing posts, tagging other friends etc.
2. The issues I’ve been having are very embarrassing
3. I don’t really want to confide in her anymore because: in December, I had an abortion; I didn’t want to but had to. She assured me she’d be there every step, whenever/whatever I needed etc… The day before my appointment at the clinic she texts “if I didn’t say anything *partner* was going to” saying she can’t be there for me, it’s all I was talking about (which it wasn’t), calling me self centred, immature etc & she’s not coming to the clinic with me after promising she would.
4. She lies to get out of seeing me. Now, I appreciate not having the capacity to socialise which she knows as we’ve talked about it. E.g. she told me they were at the hospital waiting for an x-ray for her son, while he was posting stories about his post hospital snacks.
5. 3-4 weeks before her bday, she told me that I was coming go karting with her, her partner & son for her bday, so told her to let me know the plan. Then radio silence, didn’t hear a peep from her or her partner. I assume if you want me there you’ll let me know the plan or at the very least check I’m not working. Next time I heard from her was her saying thank you for saying happy birthday.
6. Between her birthday and her kicking off at me her partner text me asking me to dog sit for them while they have some plumbing work done then when I sent him a screenshot of my work schedule he booked the plumber for a day I couldn’t do and made a snide comment about hiding the dogs & kid in the car like it’s my fault…
7. Her New Year’s resolution was saying no more & mine was to put myself first more because I always put myself last, which again we’ve had many a conversation about. 

Notes: I apologised for not being there, not saying anything, assured her no ill intent, explained I understand me having it one way doesn’t mean anyone else has it better/worse, explained I am at max capacity right now, & pointed out that I have to prioritise my health over her in the same way she has to prioritise her and her families health over me.

147,1cwc2v9,AITA if I don’t attend a wedding as a plus one because I didn’t get my own invite? ,"I 25(F) am really close with my cousin 26(m) and over the past two years I’ve gotten close with the people in his friend group. I’ve attended a lot of parties they’ve thrown, including birthday, Christmas and Halloween, as well as casual hang outs on a Friday night. I’ve also invited them to my birthday party. I’m in their group chat as well. I felt like I was good friends with all of them, especially the girls. One girl, let’s call her Kelly, is engaged a guy in the group, let’s call him Ken.  Kelly and Ken invited me to their engagement party about a year ago, to which I brought a gift and had a grand old time with them and all their friends and family. 

About 3 months ago my cousin came over to hang out and he said “you didn’t get an invite to the wedding huh?” And I said no I didn’t. He then told me that Kelly and Ken really want me to come but I must come as someone’s plus one, and I had to pick which one of the guys in the group to be my date. This caught me off guard as I honestly found it tacky. If they want me there why wouldn’t they just send an invite?? Also, if you don’t have space to host me, which I understand, don’t try to set up a complicated work around to have me there. I just found it distasteful, but I was uncomfortable so I chose one of his friends. 

3 months later I still hadn’t been invited to the wedding by that friend, so I figured he had found another date. Didn’t really bother me because the whole situation made me kind of feel icky. Well, he texted me today asking me to be his date. I told him I’d let him know because I might have work, after all, I didn’t get a save the date or an invite so I didn’t have the chance to request work off. He told me the rsvp date is in 2 days. I also found this sort of tacky. Why invite me so last minute?? He said that Kelly and Ken told him they really want me there. 

I thought we were all close enough friends that I would just get an invite. After all, I was invited to the engagement party, to Kelly’s Birthday party, to Kens birthday party, and they came to my birthday as well. I honestly thought we were all good friends, but now I’m thinking we aren’t as good of friends as I thought, or even friends at all. This whole no invitation plus one situation makes me uncomfortable. Would I be the asshole if I don’t attend the wedding because I’m uncomfortable with this? Or maybe I’m being overly sensitive.

148,1cwbvze,AITA for telling my sister she needs to get her daughter some help and she can't keep ignoring the problem?,"My sister was a single mom to Ava (9f) before she got married last year. It was just the two of them before my sister met Nick and moved in with him and his kids. Now it's Nick, my sister, Nick's three kids who are preteens or teenagers and Ava. Ava never met her dad.

Ava's always had social problems. This isn't even the first time I raised my concerns to my sister about Ava. But now that it's no longer the two of them it is presenting itself far more and is causing far more issues than before. These social problems are generally around how she talks to people. She tells them what she likes because her own brain says her interests are best and everyone else is supposed to like them because other things are dumb. She gets angry when this is challenged or ignored by others. To the point she will yell at them. But then she can't figure out why they get mad right back at her. And I do believe her that she doesn't understand. It both upsets and confuses her. She can't understand kids in school bullying her and the fact that she can never keep a friend. She also invites herself into games uninvited and then gets upset/mad when plans are kept that were not planned with her. Like playing with the neighborhood kids and getting upset they want to the park, which they planned to do already, because the park is awful and she hates it. She became inconsolable when that happened.

There are times I have attempted to explain to Ava why people don't want to do what she does and she looked at me like I was crazy and went into very detailed descriptions of why her interests are the best and why everyone should love them.

She has been like this with Nick's kids and my sister and Nick see themselves as a family so treat it like ""oh they have to get along in some ways"". But it's clear Nick's kids do not like Ava and they have made it perfectly clear she is not family in their eyes. They are ice cold to her and angry around her most of the time. Then it bubbles over like a couple of days ago when Ava turned off their console because she decided they would all play together and not video games. This resulted in the oldest yelling and cursing at Ava, calling her names, saying everyone hates her and she's such a burden to have around and they wish they could send her away forever and never see her again. Ava had a huge meltdown and was screaming she didn't understand. My sister said this went on for hours. It freaked her and Nick out but it still didn't give her the encouragement to seek help for Ava. All that came from that was Nick's kids were punished.

This is where I came in and told my sister she needs to get Ava help and she can't keep ignoring the problems Ava has. I told her Ava deserves help because she doesn't seem capable of grasping everything and there is very possibly a valid reason for that and maybe it needs to be explained a certain way.

My sister didn't take too kindly to me interfering and told me I was overstepping.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-20,"AITA for telling my sister she needs to get her daughter some help and she can't keep ignoring the problem? My sister was a single mom to Ava (9f) before she got married last year. It was just the two of them before my sister met Nick and moved in with him and his kids. Now it's Nick, my sister, Nick's three kids who are preteens or teenagers and Ava. Ava never met her dad.

Ava's always had social problems. This isn't even the first time I raised my concerns to my sister about Ava. But now that it's no longer the two of them it is presenting itself far more and is causing far more issues than before. These social problems are generally around how she talks to people.

149,1cwbrpd,AITA for telling my lonely immigrant neighbor to leave me alone,"I met a girl because she knocked on my door and told me she wanted to be my friend because she was also a foreigner. I'm visibly foreign in this country (white), she is not to my eye (she's Mongolian), so I was surprised by her approach. I came over to her apartment and had a very uncomfortable conversation where she told me about her negative experiences with people from my country and her university performance. She also made a point of asking after my salary and said she really ought to make more than me because her Japanese skills were stronger than mine. I didn't like spending time with her but I agreed to meet again at an event.

The next day I had a friend over: the neighbor rings my bell. She's got a snack. In retrospect, she had seen me arrive home and wanted to be invited over specifically because I had another foreigner friend over. I said thank you, that's lovely, here's my friend X but we're busy, I'll message you later. She would not leave. I said variations on ""I'm busy right now"" and ""now isn't a good time"" multiple times, in both of our mutual languages, and she just wouldn't leave. I ended up shutting the door on her.

Two days later, same friend is over, and the neighbor rings. I see her on the camera. We go silent and wait. She rings again, again, texts me saying that she saw me arrive home. 

At that point I felt really freaked out. The neighbor tried to come by the next day as well, a few minutes after I get home, and I'm now confident that she's actually watching for me to get home. That day I got home late and immediately went to bed, lights off, and I was outright mad she'd try to come over when I'm trying to sleep. My friend advised me to report it to the local police so that they'd ask her to stop harassing me. I've had good experiences with them but tbh I'm ""the right kind"" of foreigner and I think that she is not, and I suspected she was in violation of her visa based off what she said to me about her work on that first night we met. Getting someone deported for being invasive seemed a bit much.

I stew over it. The next day is the day we're meant to go out together. I message her a few hours before and say I don't want to meet her anymore and that her coming by made me very uncomfortable. 

She replied and seemed very sad, said she was lonely. Came by and knocked. I ignored it. She messaged to apologize and said she was having a hard time in this country. I said ""please leave me alone."" I blocked her and I never saw her again. All this happened over the course of less than a week. I feel bad because I think she was harmless and probably somewhat unwell. She genuinely scared me with her persistence but I think that's because of my own issues.

But I don't care if it is traditional or not I hate beans. But she told me to at least try it so I did just in my first spoon I absolutely hated it. So as I hated it so much I thought to offer it to my brother or my mom but she told that I had to eat majority of it as it cost a pretty penny to make. If she was going to spend so much money on making it why did she put one of my least favorite foods ever. 

Not the food in question is a food commonly found in south Asia it is called 'Chhat'. It isn't something like a big chunk of meat you have to prepare the individual ingredients individually and prepare it plate by plate and she could've easily not put the beans on my plate but she did. 

Now I genuinely hated it so when she told me to eat the majority of it I removed every single bean on my spoon before eating it but when I did she told that there is so many beans left and that I had to it the most of it. When she first said eat the majority she never specified that it had to be majority of each item but as a whole and now that I did eat 'majority' I have to eat all the beans as well. Eventually I managed to win the argument but this makes me wonder AITA. 

Also the amount of beans left was quite a lot and when picking out individual bean it took like 30-40 seconds per spoon. I genuinely don't know why does she keep putting food I hate[she does this regularly] and today I finally though that I should post this.

151,1cwblkh,AITA for not allowing my best friend’s boyfriend to stay at my house?,"I (26F) have a best friend, Rachel (26F), who has been dating her boyfriend, Mike (27M), for about a year. Rachel and I have been close since college, and she often stays over at my place when she’s in town because I have a guest room and she doesn’t.

Recently, Rachel asked if Mike could stay with us for a week while his apartment was being fumigated. The thing is, I’ve had some bad experiences with Mike in the past. He’s always been somewhat rude and dismissive towards me, and there were a few occasions when he disrespected my house rules, like smoking inside and leaving a mess in the kitchen. Despite these issues, I’ve kept quiet for the sake of my friendship with Rachel.

When Rachel asked if Mike could stay, I told her I wasn’t comfortable having him in my house. I explained my reasons, citing his past behavior. Rachel was upset and said I should have brought up these issues earlier if they bothered me so much. She also argued that Mike had nowhere else to go and that she would vouch for his behavior this time around.

I stuck to my decision, suggesting that Mike find a short-term rental or stay with another friend. Rachel is now angry with me, saying I’m being unreasonable and letting personal grievances get in the way of helping someone in need. She’s even hinted that our friendship might not be the same after this.

Some of our mutual friends think I’m being too harsh and should give Mike another chance, especially since Rachel has promised to ensure he follows my house rules. Others understand my hesitation, given his past behavior.

Then she proceeds to try to justify why being a DogMom counts and even starts saying it’s harder than being a Mother. Her reasons included, dogs are a commitment for their whole lives but once a kid turns 18 you can kick them out. Dogs can never feed them selves but my kids can. 

I ended up just saying “What? Kids are a life long commitment. It’s still not the same but okay whatever” and walking away to return to working. 

(Edited. Because I realized that I miscommunicated the order of events. Everything from below here was not actually said. Just thoughts and feelings afterwards) 

I’m sorry but what? My 14yo does most of the care for our 3 dogs, he’s usually the one to fill their food bowls and change out their water. Does that mean he’s a dad? My 10yo does the care for our cat feeding/watering is she a mom? Hell my 3 year old helps both of them. 

As for her argument of kids are only an 18 year commitment but dogs are lifetime, most dogs don’t even make it to 18yo… my kids will always be apart of me. I will worry about them until the day I die. 

Call yourself whatever you want but don’t try to act like it’s the same as being a parent. I get that you love your animals, I love mine too. But until you’ve had a baby wake you up to be fed a every few hours, or had a child come in for comfort in the middle of the night because of a bad dream, or sat out in 100+ temps at a ball game, or worried about if your kid is getting enough calories, or had you legs used ramps for car, or sat in the hospital for 1.5 days while your baby got chest X-rays and tests done because his O2 levels weren’t good, etc… there’s many other experiences that make someone a parents.

155,1cwa7oo,AITA for not doing a supervisor's job on her vacation?,"This is relatively low stakes and I feel silly typing it but it upset me and I'm thinking I may have been the asshole. 

I work at a small convenience store. One of my supervisors is responsible for date checking grocery stuff, but she often delegates her work onto me. She left for vacation and asked me to do her date checks if I could. I said I'd try. They're pretty low on the priority list at work, especially under fresh food, so things happened, I had to take orders from other supervisors and basically I could only finish some and the rest came up as 'overdue'.

Today she stormed up to me and asked why the date checks weren't done, and I was stunned so I couldn't get a proper response out besides 'I'm sorry but I tried and I was given other work'. She said it wasn't good enough, that some of those involved baby food and she wasn't happy with me at all.

I work at a small convenience store. One of my supervisors is responsible for date checking grocery stuff, but she often delegates her work onto me. She left for vacation and asked me to do her date checks if I could. I said I'd try. They're pretty low on the priority list at work, especially under fresh food, so things happened, I had to take orders from other supervisors and basically I could only finish some and the rest came up as 'overdue'.

Today she stormed up to me and asked why the date checks weren't done, and I was stunned so I couldn't get a proper response out besides 'I'm sorry but I tried and I was given other work'. She said it wasn't good enough, that some of those involved baby food and she wasn't happy with me at all.

164,1cw7ynf,AITA For Not Helping My Newly “Disabled” Father Pay Off His Debts?,"I (25F) was raised by my father (51M). He raised me and my older sister practically by himself with little help from my mother financially. When my sister was old enough to drive he bought her a practically new car. When I was old enough to drive, I had to wait until I was in college before he did the same. Of course it took a while because we hoped my mother would buy it for me this time, as his financials constantly got worse over the years, so when he did buy one I was very grateful, as I know it was hard for him and I was lucky I got one at all; most kids don’t. He paid for my housing, food, insurance, and phone while I lived with him until recently.

I now live with my girlfriend (who makes the money for our household) and I pay the entire phone bill every month which is more than my share for my car insurance too. He does not pay for anything and I felt free to “leave the nest” and not have to worry about his financials anymore like I had to growing up.

Recently, my dad took out a loan and put the car up for collateral to get it as it was his car in title but I only used it and was going to be given the title once I moved out. One day I woke up to it repossessed without a warning. After a whole ordeal, my girlfriend saved me, and therefore my dad, and payed nearly 3 grand to get my car back. My dad apologized and said he thought he had more time and in the future he would tell me if he needs this help, since my car would be taken otherwise. (Side note: my mother later informed me the same thing happened to her when they were married so he has made this mistake before)

Around the same time this happened, my dad, a heavy drinker, quit suddenly and with that a lot of other health issues popped up. The most recent one being a small stroke that left half his body looking normal, but feeling numb and tingly. Because of this it is hard for him to work and he was already financially struggling. He now gets some government aid, but he is still in a debt hole living paycheck to paycheck. I should also mention I say “disabled” because he isn’t medically diagnosed as such, since the feeling is returning just slowly.

Forwarding to now, my dad let me know that he cannot make a payment in two days and therefore my car would be in danger again. In order to save it, my girlfriend would have to put another grand into a dept that is not ours to pay and would not get back.  My car is 8 years old, only worth about 10k and technically still his, and I want to just give it back to him and let him loose it and wipe my hands clean of any obligation to help. I would be fine without it now, and it would help His debt be paid I think. I can’t see how it’s worth paying the rest of his loan off and “buying” a car that I already had claim to.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-20,"AITA For Not Helping My Newly “Disabled” Father Pay Off His Debts? I (25F) was raised by my father (51M). He raised me and my older sister practically by himself with little help from my mother financially. When my sister was old enough to drive he bought her a practically new car. When I was old enough to drive, I had to wait until I was in college before he did the same. Of course it took a while because we hoped my mother would buy it for me this time, as his financials constantly got worse over the years, so when he did buy one I was very grateful, as I know it was hard for him and I was lucky I got one at all; most kids don’t. He paid for my housing, food, insurance, and phone while I lived with him until recently.

I now live with my girlfriend (who makes the money for our household) and I pay the entire phone bill every month which is more than my share for my car insurance too. He does not pay for anything and I felt free to “leave the nest” and not have to worry about his financials anymore like I had to growing up.

Recently, my dad took out a loan and put the car up for collateral to get it as it was his car in title but I only used it and was going to be given the title once I moved out. One day I woke up to it repossessed without a warning. After a whole ordeal, my girlfriend saved me, and therefore my dad, and payed nearly 3 grand to get my car back. My dad apologized and said he thought he had more time and in the future he would tell me if he needs this help, since my car would be taken otherwise. (Side note: my mother later informed me the same thing happened to her when they were married so he has made this mistake before)

Around the same time this happened, my dad, a heavy drinker, quit suddenly and with that a lot of other health issues popped up. The most recent one being a small stroke that left half his body looking normal, but feeling numb and tingly. Because of this it is hard for him to work and he was already financially struggling. He now gets some government aid, but he is still in a debt hole living paycheck to paycheck. I should also mention I say “disabled” because he isn’t medically diagnosed as such, since the feeling is returning just slowly.

Forwarding to now, my dad let me know that he cannot make a payment in two days and therefore my car would be in danger again. In order to save it, my girlfriend would have to put another grand into a dept that is not ours to pay and would not get back.  My car is 8 years old, only worth about 10k and technically still his, and I want to just give it back to him and let him loose it and wipe my hands clean of any obligation to help.

When we first moved in togeher she had a long distance boyfriend, who only visited 2x before they broke up. We then lived together  for about 6 months, until she meet her current boyfriend.

She and her current boyf meet at the end of May. We're all in college so I went home for the summer, right when they started dating. They  stayed in our college town tho and when I would call her to catch up she told me they were spending everyday together at our apartment. I wasn't bothered by this but asked if that was going to be the case when I came back? Without even missing a beat said ""that'll change when you get back, we'll both be busier, there will be more stuff going on"" I told her as long as a get a day or two w/out him there I'd be fine and she said ""oh no, he'll only be here 3/4 days a week max"" (we had this convo multiple times throughout the summer)

When I came back in August, I relaized he really was over every day. I was a little suprised because she was so reassuring over the phone that this wouldn't happen. 3 weeks later I brought up his constatnt prescence. She apologized immediately, and said she actually wanted  some space from him but she feel bad telling him that since he was so sweet and and is very sensistive. I told her she could tell him on her own time, but if they could just respect I didn't want him over everyday.

Weeks went by there was no change and always a new reason as to why he had to be at our apartment. He had family problems, she had family problems, he was having friend problems, she was having friend problems, etc..

3 months went by, I was getting pretty sick of him. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around him and when he was over they never cleaned up after themselves. Every night I'd wait for the 2 of them to go to bed to start cleaning the kitchen, if I tired to  beforehand my roomate would scold me and say ""we're going to clean that, don't touch it"" but they never did and wond up going to bed because they were tired.

Just when I couldn't stand him  we had our holiday breaks, I went home felt better.  . But of course come January he was right back at our place every damn day. I had to have the conversation for what felt like the 20th time. I said I agreeded to live with her not him, and now needed 3 days w/out him. After that convo, it finally stuck. BUT then my roomate started calling and texting me checking if it was okay whenever he came over. I know she is trying to be respectful but I don't want her to feel like she can't have her own boyfriend in our apartment?

171,1cw6wol,WIBTA by asking for utility payments from a roommate who doesn’t actually live here?,"I’ve been living in a four-bed student apartment for a couple years now, and the utilities have been under my name that whole time. I get the gas and utility bills every month, and I split the cost four ways but pay a little extra on my part for my car which I charge outside using one of the outlets. After doing those calculations I send out Venmo requests, and save for some occasional delays it hasn’t been an issue for years.

However, at the end of this last semester three of the roommates moved out and three new ones were meant to move in. I informed them ahead of time that I handled the utility payments and to let me know if they had any questions. I heard nothing from any of them in return, but figured I’d simply address it when they moved in. When move-in day came around however, I noticed that only one of them *actually* moved in. The other two rooms didn’t seem to be opened and the apartment was unusually silent. Again, I just let this be, assuming that perhaps they just planned to move in later.

This was all early this month. The other day the first bill finally came in, and the other rooms still seemed untouched. I sent out another email saying that the gas bill has come in and that I needed everyone’s Venmo. The one guy that moved in was very quick at getting his back to me, but I heard nothing else from the other two until I received an email from one of them with the following message:

> I've rented this place to store my belongings over the summer, as I've been out of the country since the beginning of the rental period. Since I'm not living there, would it be okay if you and the others could split the utility bills without including me?

> Thanks for your understanding!

Now normally I would be annoyed but willing to maybe bite the bullet. However it’s not just him but *two* people gone, meaning the 25% split would now be just a 50/50 between the other roommate and I if the other person is in a similar situation. I’ve heard of people signing housing contracts just to establish residency for in-state tuition at my university, so the fact the fourth one hasn’t shown up yet makes me believe that’s the case as well. While on the surface this also wouldn’t be a huge issue with two people not contributing to the overall bill, I’ve been handling the utilities long enough to know full well that the *majority* of the expense comes from the AC/Heater.

However, I understand that this roommate is not *using* the utilities, and that I would be charging him for something he’s not actually benefiting from.

I told her to seek therapy about why she’s so bitter that because he was a bad husband he’s a bad dad. Because he does everything for  his children and gives her a lot of money every month but can’t take his kids to Disney world ?  She said never to ask for her children again. I love those boys, my kids ask for their cousins all the time . Breaks my heart. AITA?! ",2.0,1.0415440797805786,1,0
173,1cw6dhh,AITA for getting upset at my fiance when I just wanted to go home?,"Hi everyone. I am 39 f and my fiance is a 39 m. I have two kids from a previous marriage and he has three from his previous marriage. This weekend we went camping with just his kids and the two of us.

I started getting sick about half an hour into our 2 hour drive. Coughing, chills, clammy. I progressively got sick as the weekend continued.

He had to build a deck at our campsite. So I tried to deal with it all weekend. I did pretty good, but started to get a fever Sunday midday.

Anyway, we didn’t know that the pool was open and did not bring swimming suits. He decided to buy them when he got more lumber. He knew I wasn’t feeling good but tried to get me to take them. I couldn’t. I was feeling lousy. They decided to sneak off and go by themselves, 9 and 6. They were caught and not allowed to go into the pool for the rest of the day Saturday.

Sunday rolls around and I’m worse. I have a terrible cough, chills, a fever and just icky. I wanted to go home. He takes the kids swimming instead. He says he will only be gone for an hour. I didn’t say anything.

An hour in he calls me and says he was about to come back to the camper, but his nieces and nephew just arrived. We don’t end up leaving for two additional hours. I just felt crummy. I usually don’t complain. But I was and am legitimately sick. I’ve been in bed taking meds since we got home. I told him I was upset that he did not take me home. We don’t really argue, we talk things out and he said he was sorry, but he does these type of things regularly. 

I know the kids had to play, but we thought the pool didn’t open until Memorial Day.

174,1cw6cbr,AITA for telling my boyfriend I dislike his friend for always showing up unannounced,"My boyfriend (23) and his coworker turned friend (26) have gotten a lot closer. They hang out a lot at work and after work. Work ends at 3:30 but my bf won’t be home until 5:30-6:00 because his friend would guilt trip him into staying longer. When my boyfriend is at home with me his friend spam messages and always calls because he wants to talk or make plans to hang out. 

Despite my boyfriend saying no or saying he can’t hang out, his friend still shows up unannounced and texts that he’s outside in the driveway. My boyfriend would go out to tell him he can’t hang out, but his friend would say he needs to vent or he just wants to chill for a little. 

The first time this happened I let it slide but I explained to my boyfriend it’s not okay for his friend to do that whenever he wants. I understand not wanting to be lonely, but it’s not fair to my boyfriend that his friend always wants to trauma dump on him. 

I’ve tried to remain calm and think maybe I’m overreacting, but it’s been happening more often and it’s quite bothersome. I’ve reached the point that when I see his friend’s car in the driveway, I get irritated. His friend has a wife and a baby at home, yet he always wants to be out with his friends. Even if my bf and I have plans (his friend is aware that we’re busy) he will still show up at the house. I feel as if his friend has no respect for other’s space and time.

175,1cw6ag0,AITA for not being present enough in my girlfriend buying her first car?,"For context my girlfriend just bought her first car from a dealership, she’s doesn’t have anyone else in her life who could help her in this situation because nobody in her life has purchased a vehicle through dealership. My girlfriend just got her license about 2 years ago, and she’s been searching for a car for the last year or so. 

I’ve been telling her ever since she started searching that this is her first car and she should get something not too expensive like no more than 12k , she’s not making boatloads of cash and nor do I. She hasn’t listened to me and constantly been on the prowl for a certain car she wants, a 2022 Honda accord, recently she asked me what’s the price range she should look between for her car, after a year of her disregarding what I say I just caved and said anywhere from 10-15k is reasonable, I thought this would be a small step up from what I said previously and it’s still within reason. 

She finds a 2021 Nissan rogue which was supposed to be listed at close to 20k, she feels as though she’s gotta have the latest and greatest. I decided it’s her money and she has the right to spend it on what she pleases. Now I’m a car guy through and through, I’m also mechanic and I love to work on cars and drive for fun. So I’m all for going after the car you want but be honest with yourself on what you can afford. Anyway yesterday she went to the dealership on her own and acquired her car. I would’ve gone with her but we are currently in different states for education. After looking at the paperwork it looks like the dealership tacked on an extra $15,000 after taxes fees and all other financials were handled and she has an outrageous monthly payment. 

She’s currently upset with me and claims I should’ve stuck to what I said originally about her getting a cheaper car despite her being hard headed. Along with being upset with me because she feels as though I should’ve been over the phone with her during the process and caught any shady business the salesman pitched since I’ve been to a dealership before (though only once) and kinda know and understand how salesman are. I admit that I could’ve been over the phone but I refused to accept those accusations because there were many other alternatives that could’ve been taken to prevent something like this from happening and blame should not solely be on me.

178,1cw5yaa,AITA for misspelling my friend's newborn's name?,"Am I the Asshole? My closest friend (we've known each other for 18 years) and my business partner (for 7 years) recently had their first baby (via surrogate, he's a single Dad). I wasn't able to be with him during the birth as it took place in another country, so we've been texting a lot. The baby was born 4 weeks ago. 

During a text conversation a few days ago, I accidentally misspelled his son's name as ""Jessie"" instead of ""Jesse"". So I accidentally added an ""i"" to the name while busily writing out a message about him possibly being underweight because he was premature. I said, ""Is Jessie gaining weight fast enough?"" My friend replied, ""It's Jesse friend-who-should-really-know-that"". Now, not having registered that I had misspelled the name, I took this to mean that I should know about newborns' WEIGHT in general. I was confused, I didn't think this was obvious knowledge. So not realising that he was referring to the spelling, I made the ""Jessie"" mistake again a second time a minute later. He corrected me again and I then realised and apologised. I said it was a simple mistake. He said he didn't care, it's his son's name. Since then I have consciously spelled the name correctly every time.

My friend was very offended by the misspelling. For the last day, we've been having a fight about this - probably 40 long text messages. I've apologised a couple of times. But I've also told him that it's ridiculous to be punishing me with this argument for the mistake, and that he needs to have more understanding. He's said that I should know the spelling (even though we've never talked about how Jessie/e can be spellied several ways until now, I guess he expected me to realise). He's said that I haven't taken enough responsibility and acknowledged how the misspelling made him feel. I've told him to chill out, that this is petty and that he's blown this mistake completely out of proportion. I haven't made the mistake since. He's moved between calling it a misspelling and that it wasn't a mistake, that I entirely ""forgot"" his son's name. He recently said ""a mistake would be calling him Jessr or Jessw because those letters are near the letter e. But you actually spelt out the whole spelling of the alternative name (Jessie) which means you actually thought that was his name.""

I've felt shitty for 24 hours because of this. I've apologised twice but he wants more - to acknowledge how I made him feel and acknowledge that this is much worse than how I see it. I just think that's way too much for what happened. As his closest friend for 18 years, who has made Jesse a baby gift, is single-handedly running his business while he's away and has been checking in almost daily (apparently not enough though), I thought he might be a bit more understanding.

We have been here for 2 years now, and the place is quiet, save for a gaggle of kids ranging from 2 - 9 years old playing outside. The kids have not caused us any issues. They usually play outside in the small lot unsupervised, but they aren't annoying.



The issue is the new neighbors that moved in across from us.



These neighbors, a couple, watch the kids sometimes. The issue is that the couple is LOUD. I can hear them clearly from my room, because they shout at the kids on the stairwell, which is next to my bed. The lady shouts near constantly when addressing the kids.



The issue is that I work overnights. I work 3pm to 11pm, and 11pm to 7am, so the only consistent time I have to sleep is 8am until 2pm.



It has been a struggle getting any sleep because they will be stomping and shouting when I'm sleeping, and it wakes me up when I'm trying to rest before a shift.



Today my sister stepped outside to ask them to keep the noise down. Nothing changed. I went outside to try explaining to them what my situation is.



I said that their shouting wakes me up, and asked if we can work on a compromise. The lady said, ""We can compromise when we move out."" I said that I work overnights and can only sleep during the morning. Her husband says, ""I used to work overnights, and no one else cared. This is the real world, and we're allowed to be out here. Why do you want us to whisper and tip-toe around for you?""



So, I replied, ""You're saying I don't deserve to sleep for more than 3 hours?""



I said that I make an effort to keep quiet when I'm leaving for my job at night and would appreciate the same courtesy for when I am asleep. I asked if it would be fair to keep their voices down around the stairwell from 8am-2pm. They replied, ""You need to take it up with the kids' parents, because we aren't doing anything wrong."" I told them the kids were not the issue, and it was the adults' voices that woke me up. They argued back that there was no noise curfew after 8am, and that a complaint wouldn't do anything. I said I wouldn't submit one.



One of the older kids apologized and said that she would talk to her mom. I was in the middle of thanking her when the lady interrupted us by telling the kid, ""No! Don't apologize for being a kid and playing!""



The husband added, ""What do you even do at night anyway?""



My sister heard this and stepped out. She firmly told them that the issue was the adults were shouting and repeatedly waking me up. They were suddenly apologetic. We headed inside, and for a few minutes they're still shouting. But from my room I can hear the lady shout at the kids, ""Stop shouting! You're being rude to our neighbors!"" or ""Get off the stairwell!"" In a loud voice that I can still hear. I think she was doing this out of spite.



I'm considering raising a complaint to the apartment complex anyway, so they have this on record. I'm paranoid that the neighbors will retaliate.
