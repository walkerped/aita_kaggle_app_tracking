0,1cwlo0l,AITA for not trusting my mother?,"I am a 18 year old, she is 59.

For context, I suffer from depression since some years ago already so I wasnt the happiest to begin with but now I also got gender dysphoria which is making me feel so empty and joyless. It seems like a edgy angsty teen thing but trust me when I say it really is a huge problem for me and I dont say it to sound cool, in fact I wish I wasnt sad like this.

We were privately talking and she asked me why is it that im always unhappy/irritated/angry and that she would love to see me laugh just a little bit. I replied that its not something she can fix and that only I can do it since after all, it depends on me to fix my own gender dysphoria and come to terms with who I am.

Then she told me that it is ok to think like that but that I should live in the moment and try to enjoy the current state of my life a bit more instead of thinking about the future since that will make me much happier.

I said that I completely agree with her and I do want to think like that but I just feel so genuinely unhappy about my life. I told her that im really trying to make a change but its so hard when the feelings are this harsh, pessimistic and strong. I also said that im genuinely sorry since I know it hurts her but I dont want to fake a smile around my own mother just to give her the ilusion im improving. It makes me sad that she has to tolerate me along with her already ongoing issues in her life. 

She remarked that she also has her bad habits I have to tolerate. I responded in agreement but also said that ""I do have to tolerate your moments because its your house we are living in, after all""

Then she replied ""or else what am I going to do get you out of the house? (said sarcastically)""

Here is where things turn sour, I did not deny that possibility. Which really bothered her, I tried to ""justify"" it by saying that If I depend on other people to have basic care needs met then I may lose those people because they will reject me for being trans when I tell them and I will lose that basic care (I didnt tell her like that directly, like the reject me for being trans thing but that was what I was referring to). I told her that it is very hard for me to trust anyone.

She said that she truly was dissapointed that I just see her as any other person, as a part of ""anyone"" if you know what I mean. I realized that I hurt her feelings so I told her to not take it personally since its like that with everyone. She got hurt by that too since I just lumped her in with everyone else.

After that I tried to apologize but I ended up leaving since it was no use.

1,1cwlctn,UPDATE on spending my son's university fund on a trip to Europe to drink beer with monks.,"Hi everyone. We are on our way to the airport and on our way to Barcelona. We will be going to be in Europe for a month. The visit to the monks at Westvleteren will be the last part of our trip. Two reasons. I don't want to lug beer bottles all over Spain, France, Belgium and Holland. Also I am putting it off for as long as I can. 

For those of you that asked my son's name is Ryan. He was an amazing kid. I don't know if he got his love of the microscopic world from me. I did teach him how to make his own sourdough starter and I will be keeping his alive to make loaves and waffles with. His ashes are in our yard, on Mount Tremblant, on the shores of the St. Lawrence and I will be taking some to Belgium. My grandfathers have many friends buried there and I think they would approve. 

I thank everyone that offered to buy me a beer. And while I appreciate the offer I'm pretty sure my liver, and my wife, would not have been happy with me. I will be with the monks on the week of June 23rd. If you would like to join me in a toast with your favorite drink of choice I would love that more. I love knowing that people all around the world know about my son and he would love knowing he was toasted in such a manner. 

I spoke with my wife, my ex wife, her husband, and his son. I invited them to join us, at my expense, for the last week of my trip. My wife's stepson was friends with my son. I didn't know how close until we spoke. They are gaming buddies. They spoke almost every day playing online. He gave me a picture of my son I did not have. It is a picture of the two of them age about 14/15 at my ex wife's wedding to his father. My son looked great in his suit. I cried. He did too. We had a very awkward but heartfelt man hug. Then we laughed. They will be coming to say goodbye with us. 

After talking to my accountant and my lawyer I was told that I could not have transferred him the value of the RESP. I have decided, after talking to my wife, that we are going to give him enough money to cover one year of tuition. Even after my trip we will have money left over. I'm trying to do some good with it. I also said that he could call us any time he needed since he will be attending school close to us. So funny he got accepted here and my son was accepted there. 

I want to thank everyone who shared their condolences with me. I want to especially thank everyone that helped me plan my visit to Belgium. I know we won't see each other but you were invaluable.

2,1cwjhk8,UPDATE - AITA for Not Sticking Up for My Brother After My Boyfriend Called Him Out?,"Hi  again everyone,

I wanted to write a quick update now that Sunday is over. Original Post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cumoi4/aita_for_not_sticking_up_for_my_brother_after_my/)

I ended up talking to my Aunt Amy and Uncle Joe last night when I went over for dinner as I mentioned. They have always been a safe haven for me, and it was really comforting to hear their perspective. Amy and Joe told me that my parents have always been wrong in how they treated me and that the way they let Tom belittle me is not okay. They said that whenever they tried to stand up for me, my parents would not let them see me and Tom.

One instance they brought up really hit home for me. I remember not getting to see Aunt Amy and Uncle Joe for a few months after my mom and Amy got into an argument. This happened after Tom ruined some of my favorite books, and Aunt Amy tried to defend me. She told my mom that it wasn't fair for Tom to face no consequences and that I deserved better. My mom got so furious at Amy's interference that she decided to cut off contact for a while. I think I was 7, I didn't fully understand why I suddenly couldn't visit them anymore, but I remember being upset and even more isolated.

Joe explained that this is why they always tried to take me on outings whenever they could. It was their way of giving me a break from the environment at home. It hit just seemed to hit me all at once while we were talking. They’re the ones who took me to the zoo, a movie, or just a walk in the park, all my happy memories as a kid were never with my parents. Honestly, they’re who I think of when I think of what a parent should be.

After our talk, I've decided to go no contact with my parents and Tom for the time being. I need to focus on what I want and what’s good for me. My aunt and uncle also promised they’d run interference for me so I don’t have to deal with them.

Also, Alex proposed to me yesterday morning. I honestly didn’t expect it, but I’m so happy. We’re going to be visiting his family over the long weekend to celebrate and my aunt and uncle are going to go with us. I don’t know what’s going to come of cutting my parents and brother out but I’m glad I’m doing it.

3,1cwgzxm,AITA for going behind the bride's back for a wedding?,"I, 23M have this friend, Joseph, 26M, who I met in a group home. I had a pretty rough childhood and he took care of me in the home, which can be not so great if you're one of the youngest. Anyway. We became close pretty much immediately and as we grew up we became best mates. I recently graduated, and he was there, I helped him get a job, etc.

His future wife Amy doesn't like me. I have no idea why, its not even a mutual feeling. I brought it up to Joseph once but he dismissed it saying she has no reason to dislike me. I know, thats part of why I'm confused.

Anyway, Joseph is getting married, I'm his best man which Amy is unhappy about. This is probably the time to mention that Joseph is South Asian and Amy is White so they're having a mix of cultures at the wedding. As a member of the groom's half I've got to wear something South Asian. So I picked out this red kurta set. Amy didn't like it because she thought red would look too bridal.

I'm a guy so I was confused but desi brides do traditionally wear red (she's wearing white though) so fair enough. I then picked out a blue one, she said the blue was too bright, I then picked a green one, she said it didn't go with the theme. I was starting to get the feeling she was doing this on purpose (since she suggested no alternatives) and just wanted to keep me out of the wedding. So instead of asking her about it, for the next one I just went straight to Joseph for approval, he okayed it pretty much instantly, a cream kurta which matched some of the other's on his side.

Amy saw me in it for the first time yesterday and started screaming. I couldn't make out much of what she was saying since it was a lot of borderline screeching, but roughly I think she thought it was too similar to white. She called me a lot of swears, which I will not repeat and an a-hole for going behind her back. But it's Josephs's wedding too. Its not like I just chose it on my own.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cukek4/aita_for_never_telling_my_mother_i_married_into/

I got some really good feedback from my post and it led to my Husband and I staying up most of the night discussing what we wanted to do and a decision was reached. It wasn't an easy one but we have a child to think of now and she has to come first.

We blocked my Mother on every social Media, we changed our phone numbers and we reached out to the family lawyer to get in contact with her to inform her that all visits have been stopped after how she spoke to me in front of my sister. She has to get clean for at least a year with weekly tests if she wants to see my sister again. My Mother can contact our family lawyer if she needs help with the tests but beyond that she gets no help from us unless she wants to go to rehab which we will pay for, directly to the rehab not her. 

My Husband, Sister and I have also moved in with my In-Laws for the time being as my Mother knows where we live. We will be looking for a new place and my In-Laws are aware of the situation and that we are cutting all contact for now. Honestly my In-Laws are delighted to have us staying with them, when we arrived the guest room my sister is using for now had an army of Squishmallows on the bed they are her current obsession and my FIL makes sure to bring a new one each time he sees her I always think she must have them all now and each time i'm wrong, how he keeps track of what she has and doesn't have I don't know as he never buys doubles. 

We are settling in well, we are even planning a small Holiday with just my Husband, sister and I to get away from the stress we've been under, nowhere abroad as she doesn't have a passport yet but we'll be fixing that soon as we want to take her to Lapland for Christmas.

All in all we're doing alright though I admit I am feeling very conflicted and guilty over this even though I know it's the right choice it just doesn't make it easy.

Title. I'm going to college in August, and instead of getting a dorm room, i'm getting an apartment with 2 other roommates (each with their own room) near the university. I'm getting there like 4 days before all of the introductory activities start, so i can get settled. However, my parents want to stay a whooping 10 DAYS living in my apartment, in a air mattress, in my room. This just seems crazy to me.

This is such an inconvenience because 
1- I'd have to share a room with them for a whole 10 days
2- I would probably make my roommates uncomfortable with my parents being in the apartment for 10 days
3- I would literally start classes while they would still be in my apartment.

I feel like such a bad person telling them they should go home sooner, but i just feel like this is such a invasion of my privacy.

7,1cw5j85,AITA for telling my step daughter that she needs to causing drama and to grow up?,"For context I (60 yrs old) raised my step daughter (21 yrs old) since she was 11 and have been married to her mom (60 yrs old)  for 5 yrs. I know that my stepdaughter doesn’t have the best relationship with her bio dad & doesn’t like to talk about him much. But anyway she was telling me and her mom this morning that her friends have never seen a pic of her dad & that she decided to post a pic of her and her dad on her Instagram account yesterday.

I felt kind of off about it because I don’t want her to post anything that’s gonna start something since everyone thinks I’m her biological father. But we all go to church and my step daughter’s friends have heard about her dad but never seen a photo of him and she felt that it was time for them to see.

Anyway back to the story, I told my stepdaughter that she shouldn’t have posted the picture of her and her dad because it’s gonna stir conflict and that she’s gonna start nothing but drama. She tried telling me that it doesn’t matter because that’s still her dad and she still loves him. I tried to tell her that not everyone needs to know all the stuff that goes on between her and her dad. She said she wasn’t gonna tell anyone about their estranged relationship, that she just wanted to post a picture. But I think otherwise.

She tried telling me “it’s literally my dad. Why is that such a problem to you? I don’t see you getting so defensive when I post pictures of me and you? Why can’t you just understand that? What is so hard about this?? The church isn’t going to judge. At least I post about you online, I don’t ever see your 4 bio kids posting about you at all. They don’t even want to talk to you!!”

I got in self defense mode and told her “that’s different and you KNOW that. You seriously need to stop causing all this drama. You need to GROW UP! Maybe this is why you don’t have a lot of friends because you run your mouth too much and try to start something stupid every single time. It’s pathetic that you’re almost 22 yrs old and still act like a freaking child. Grow up man and go get a stupid job. I’m so tired of this.

There’s no way she’s gonna talk about my 4 kids like that and butt in like that. So I told her off and said that I said and walked out the door to my back yard to cool off. When I came back inside I could see that she had been crying and noticed tissues in the trash can.

Edit: the reason why people think I’m her bio dad at church [or anywhere] is because her dad is white, meanwhile me and her mom are full blooded Hispanic. My step daughter carries heavy genes for looking Hispanic. So people naturally think I’m her father.",Asshole,2024-05-20,"AITA for telling my step daughter that she needs to causing drama and to grow up? For context I (60 yrs old) raised my step daughter (21 yrs old) since she was 11 and have been married to her mom (60 yrs old)  for 5 yrs. I know that my stepdaughter doesn’t have the best relationship with her bio dad & doesn’t like to talk about him much. But anyway she was telling me and her mom this morning that her friends have never seen a pic of her dad & that she decided to post a pic of her and her dad on her Instagram account yesterday.

I felt kind of off about it because I don’t want her to post anything that’s gonna start something since everyone thinks I’m her biological father. But we all go to church and my step daughter’s friends have heard about her dad but never seen a photo of him and she felt that it was time for them to see.

Anyway back to the story, I told my stepdaughter that she shouldn’t have posted the picture of her and her dad because it’s gonna stir conflict and that she’s gonna start nothing but drama. She tried telling me that it doesn’t matter because that’s still her dad and she still loves him. I tried to tell her that not everyone needs to know all the stuff that goes on between her and her dad. She said she wasn’t gonna tell anyone about their estranged relationship, that she just wanted to post a picture. But I think otherwise.

She tried telling me “it’s literally my dad. Why is that such a problem to you? I don’t see you getting so defensive when I post pictures of me and you? Why can’t you just understand that? What is so hard about this?? The church isn’t going to judge. At least I post about you online, I don’t ever see your 4 bio kids posting about you at all. They don’t even want to talk to you!!”

I got in self defense mode and told her “that’s different and you KNOW that. You seriously need to stop causing all this drama. You need to GROW UP! Maybe this is why you don’t have a lot of friends because you run your mouth too much and try to start something stupid every single time. It’s pathetic that you’re almost 22 yrs old and still act like a freaking child. Grow up man and go get a stupid job. I’m so tired of this.

9,1cw5ijj,WIBTA for setting boundaries after a Mother’s Day fight?,"I (29M) posted here after a fight on Mother’s Day with my mom (47F) that opened my eyes a lot. TL;DR, we got into an explosive screaming match over the phone over some MASSIVE misinterpretations on her end, and suddenly my mom said everything from “well why don’t you go tell your step-mother?!” to “you have no idea what I’m dealing with right now! You’re not the only one with problems!” I don’t want to repost that mess here if I can avoid it, but rest assured I got the hint and now need your help because this all stemmed from a Facebook post from Mother’s Day ten years ago when I was basically saying my good-byes in a very, very dark time of my life. The post was deleted a week ago, but the fight is still in my mind.

Emotional blackmail like this is my mother’s go-to (has been since I was a kid) and until seeing you all post it here in black and white, I just thought this was normal stuff parents did. Everyone has a complicated relationship with family, right? But seeing SO many of you tell me how toxic this was made me realize what nearly 14 years of therapy with five different professionals couldn’t: that I’m just never going to be able to just live with it. I have been told so many times to cut her out of my life by going on a hundred different people at this point. I even briefly did about ten years ago. And each time I came back because I thought this time was going to be different, because something would change for a couple of months max before slipping back.

I have been told everything from “you’re nothing without me,” to “you only want me around for money,” to her favorite, “you know, I didn’t HAVE to give birth to you” (paraphrasing tremendously to comply with rules) since I was eight, at least. After a week of thinking, I talked to my husband (28M) about setting some boundaries, and these are the big two we came up with:

- No more money, ever, unless we’re about to lose our house. Christmas/Birthday/holiday gifts have a hard limit of $25 and if they’re a cent more, they aren’t accepted. If we go out to eat, my husband and I pay for ourselves. No exceptions.
- We start saving to pay her back the $5k she “gifted” us for our down payment fro the house, which I’m now thinking was actually just another loan. Any other additional “gifts” like that are rejected, and any other money we do accept from here on out is eventually paid back.

I am worried these might come off as TA-ish and as overreactions, but to keep myself out of more depressive spirals, I have to know if I’m doing the right thing. Even if I’m TA, I need to know if there’s room for nuance in that. She’s coming up next week for Memorial Day brunch, and I need outsider insight.

I would find myself sleeping on piles of their clothes or having to share room with my family members bc too many things around. It messed me up mentally and as a kid I even tried running away from home. It created a great amount of trauma for me that till this day I still resent both my parents for.
My parents decided to finally take things out of my room as a way to “compromise. Yet my place never stopped looking like someone’s junkyard.

It has been like this since I was 12 and I’ve learned to accept that they won’t change. I have not moved out due to the convenience of not having to pay extra for rent, since Im paying for my masters and also saving up to buy a house.

However, out of nowhere, 2 weeks ago or so, my parents mentioned to me that my uncle, aunt, and 2 children are moving in with us. I was in complete shock as there is absolutely NO space for them. I immediately told them how much of an invasion of privacy this is, but my parents said this is their decision. 
So now they’re here and it’s been difficult to be here with so many people. I can only imagine how it would be once I go back in school and get home late wanting to sleep. There is no space in my apartment and I feel extremely anxious. 
As I’m an adult, my only option here is to move out. I have expressed my annoyance to my parents about the fact that they couldn’t tell me about them moving in with us in advance, to give me the time to find a new space. Their response to that was that they have to give me no explanation, That I could move out as I’m an adult. As I know they are right, that is exactly what I’ll be doing. 

The problem is my partner of 4 years and I planned to buy a house within the next year. We have been saving for a while for this goal.

 However I feel myself being triggered here and I need to get out asap. I tried explaining to my partner the need for us to move out sooner than expect and at least am option of.

So as I see things, My timing is just not at his timing even mentally I don’t know how he can live with someone who verbally abuses him everyday at his place, and I need to do what is best for me mentally even if it is stressing myself out to cover rent on my own.

11,1cw5hum,"AITA for ""spying"" on my best friend's wife?","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Just to clarify, I didn't actually spy on anyone, all I did was keep tabs on her for the sake of my friend.

I (M32) have a close friend (M25) who I've gotten very close with over the past few years. Lately I'd noticed that he's been more stressed than usual, he's very much a career man so it's not like being exhausted or overworked is something new, but when we hung out he was talking less and generally just seemed uncomfortable, which definitely is out of the ordinary. After a bit of prying, I got him to admit that he has a hunch his wife might be cheating on him. According to him, she's been distant lately, and she's started going out with her ""girl friends"" multiple times a week, even though she never used to go out that much. Recently my buddy got a big promotion at his job which has forced him to put in a lot more hours, and apparently this has been putting a strain on their marriage, with them fighting more, being distant, etc.

Here's where things get complicated. Since my friend works so many hours, he doesn't really have any way or confirming or denying his suspicions. His wife says she's been visiting a friend's place, and that friend actually lives just a couple blocks from where I do. I was a bit confused about why he mentioned this detail, but after some thinking I realized maybe he was trying to ask me to check it out and see? I don't know. Clearly this topic was hard for him to talk about, and I didn't want to interrogate him to find out what he meant. I know it might sound like a reach, but what harm would I really be doing by just hanging around the area to see?

So, for the next week or so, on the way home from work I would stop and hang around outside her friend's house for half an hour or so, right around when she apparently goes to visit. Over the course of the week, I saw my friend's wife visit twice, and I took note of which days / times. I figured I'd keep tabs on my own, and then try to compare with my friend the next time we spoke. My plan was working pretty great, until my own girlfriend (F27) started wondering why I was coming home later. I'm really not comfortable with lying to her, so I fessed about what I was doing. To my surprise, this really upset her, apparently she thinks I'm spying on a woman and being a ""total creep"", and that my friend would be pissed if he knew what I was doing. I've know my friend a LOT longer than my gf, and I know that he would appreciate what I'm doing. Nonetheless, she's given me an ultimatum, and says if I don't stop now she'll tell him and his wife.

I really don't think I've overstepped, I haven't caused any harm and am just looking out for someone who's been there for me when I needed him.

12,1cw5bow,AITA for raising the temp in my apartment? ,"I live with my roomate in a fairly large apt w/ 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. Heat and AC is apart of our rent cost, and does not fluxiate per unit. My room is next to the a/c and has a vent while my roomate's is on the opposite side and does not have a vent. I typically like the apartment between 68-72F.

Now that it's getting warmer my roomate and her boyf have been waiting until I go to sleep to lower the temperature from anywhere between 58-65 F. I've asked both of them repeatedly to stop doing this. I did say if it's really hot to and they want to lower it to, 65/66 that could be okay but anything lower than that is to cold for me. My roomate said that's not fair since she don't have a vent, the apt needs to be colder so air can go into her room.

I have suggested leaving the door open, she said no. Then I offered both my fan and air purfier (which has a fan) for them to use. She said that she hate fans, that they dry out her eyes and mouth. So, then I offered my humidifer that way she wouldn't get too dry but she said no to all of it. Please keep in mind I'm not using any of these things atm and wear sweatpants, a sweatshirt, use a comfoter and multiple blankets when I go to sleep.

Since this has not stopped, I've been getting sick, I wake up freezing with a runnny nose and sore throat constantly. While I understand it sucks to be too hot, I thought I offered them enough solutions to try fix this problem.

Before I went to bed tonight I realizsed how cold it was, and saeit was set to 64. I pointed this out and she said her room was too hot. I offered up my fans again and and suggessted her to leave her door open so the air could go into her room and remined her I was sick. She of course said no to fans and door but finally said fine in after me begging to raise it to 68. My roomate sounds pissed at me though and has been extremely passive aggressive about this issue.

She of course said no to fans and door but finally said fine in after me begging to raise it to 68. My roomate sounds pissed at me though and has been extremely passive aggressive about this issue.

TBH i am the the worst when i feel slighting hot/uncomfy so i understand that, but AITA for insisting that we raise the temp?

One day, my sister (22F) came home from college to have dinner with us. I had left a plastic bag with the bread inside on the kitchen counter to take to school in the morning. I was upstairs and when i came down to eat dinner, i walked into the kitchen to see my bread gone. I asked my mom what happened to it and she said my sister ate it. I got quite pissed because I only had four pieces left and it was supposed to last me most of the school week. Then when we sat down for dinner, I confronted her and asked why she ate my bread. She said because she wanted to try it. I asked why she didn’t ask and she told me she didn’t care. I asked “what the hell is wrong with you” and my mom got mad at me and told me i was making the dinner unpleasant. 

I was in a bad mood that whole night and to make things worse, she went upstairs right after dinner and left me to do everyone’s dishes. I asked my mom why she couldn’t help and she said that my sister had a long day of school. The next day, i came into the kitchen and noticed on one of the counters was a plastic bag with my bread in it, half eaten. She didn’t even finish the bread.

14,1cw556g,AITA for talking in my own room?,"I [23M] recently decided to resume my university studies. I ended up returning to school for winter quarter, and as such, typical on-campus housing arrangements were mostly unavailable. I had some savings from the job I worked over COVID and I enjoy working and playing video games late at night so I thought I would try to find a living arrangement where I at least had a single room to myself in order to avoid disturbing other people who prefer to sleep earlier.

Availability for even off-campus housing was low mid-year so the best choice ended up being a long-term AirBnB. The cost (2000 USD/month) is very high for what is a very small single room in a house with housemates.

Before moving in, landlord 'Christopher' [M60s-70s] sent an email abt rules for living in his house. Regarding noise, the only guideline included was ""Please remember that I live in a quiet neighborhood and be respectful of my neighbors especially when in pool area as well as in the evenings."" This seemed like a reasonable level of noise/quietness to expect from tenants; I read it as 'don't throw parties that will make the neighbors call in a noise complaint.'
 
This turned out to be a significant under-representation of the level of quietude that would be expected. Upon moving in I found that one of the long-term housemates was the landlord's daughter 'Christina' [F30s-40s], who lived in an adjacent room to mine. Christina is a very light sleeper who sleeps from about 9:30 pm to 5 am. Christina is such a light sleeper that she will be woken up if I talk at normal conversational volume in my room at times past her bedtime.

I decided to try and accommodate these constraints. As such, past 9:30 I would attempt to only whisper into my headset microphone while playing video games with my friends online, etc.

This strategy seemed to mostly work. However, very occasionally over the last 5.5 months of my stay, I would forget and speak at normal conversational volume for brief periods after Christina's bedtime, which would wake her up. So far, over the last 5.5 months, this has happened 4 times.

Christopher and Christina are very unforgiving regarding 'quiet hours.' This most recent time it happened, two days ago, Christina claimed it had been an issue '5-10' times and Christopher had said he would charge me 100 USD for each subsequent violation of the 'house rules' (I know this is unenforceable). They think it's extremely unusual that anyone would be awake at any time past midnight. They claim I have a 'special schedule' due to sleeping from 2-9 am that I should make the fact that I have this 'special schedule' very explicitly clear when searching for future living arrangements.

AITA for talking at normal conversational volume in my room at all past ~9:30pm, let alone only 4 times over the duration of my lease?

16,1cw4tm7,AITA for expecting my partner to read labels?,"Background: I (36 F) recently reorganized a closet with extra bedding supplies. On one shelf: two large zippered bins with clear front windows holding blankets. On the shelf above: smaller boxes with various bedding. Each of the smaller boxes is labeled on the front with what is inside.

After I got home from work this evening my partner (38 M) told me that he couldn’t find a pillowcase. He then said “instead of searching for it, I decided to wait until I could ask you” like it was an extremely thoughtful gesture. I told him it would be in the box labeled “pillowcases” to which he said “I didn’t see anything labeled.” We verified we were discussing the same closet. Frustrated, I lead him upstairs and pointed out the labels and he said, “I was only looking at the lower shelves and there aren’t labels there. Also it was dark so I wouldn’t have been able to see the labels.”

At this point I’m very frustrated. I ask him how he can say that he looked for something if he didn’t actually look. He says he never would’ve expected to see labels like that and his whole life he’s just dug around until he found what he was looking for. He then goes on that he knew I’d worked hard to organize this so he didn’t want to mess it all up by looking through everything to find what he was looking for.

At this point I’ve made it clear that I’m really annoyed. I tell him it’s frustrating that i basically dummy-proofed it and he still can’t find it. He says he doesn’t want to keep talking about it. I told him I never wanted to talk about it, that’s why I’d labeled all of the boxes. 

Then he starts talking about how impossible it is to know what’s going to make me mad. He said he knew if he’d taken all of the boxes down to look through them, I’d be mad. So he decided to wait and just ask me where it would be, but I’m still mad. He says that no matter what, I’m always just going to be mad.

I tried explaining that there were other options, like he turned on a light and used his eyes to read the labels, or, after I stated they were in a box labeled pillowcases, he went and checked the closet again before stating he didn’t see anything labeled.

He keeps telling me I’m acting like he’s done something wrong and I tell him I think he has. Then he tells me that I “clearly don’t understand” and explains again that he was doing a nice thing by not just pulling everything down and waiting to ask me where things are. I’ve asked him to go explain this situation to any woman that he knows and see what they say. He won’t.

I feel like he didn’t actually try and then waited to get me to do it for him but is trying to tell me I should be appreciative of this extra work he’s bestowed upon me.

He says he thinks he was doing a nice thing by not messing up the organized closet and that I’m being mean for insinuating that he’s “a dummy.” He says he now doesn’t feel safe asking me questions because I’ll  make him feel stupid.

17,1cw4tj6,AITA for telling off one of my friends for completely blowing things out of proportion with another friend?,"So, I've been friends with this girl. (I'll call her callie). Callie has a habit of making herself a victim, in like, everything.

So one day, I was hanging out with my other friend (I'll call her Sarah), when Callie had come along. We didn't mind it, and we were just chatting like usual, when Callie mentioned that her mom wasn't allowing her to a concert anymore. Sarah and Callie were supposed to go together before.

Honestly, I didn't believe Callie one bit, because she's been pushing Sarah and I away lately for her new gf, (I'll call her Ellie). Ellie is a bad person, and did horrible things to Sarah back when they used to be friends. Obviously that bothered Sarah and I, but we can't choose who Callie dates, so we just usually avoid the topic.

Anyways, a while later, Callie had to go home, when Sarah and I had an idea. If Callie couldn't go anymore, perhaps she could give me her ticket so that Sarah and I could go together? 

Sarah and I knew this was a long shot, but it was worth a try. so we used Sarah's phone to text Callie because mine had died.

She asked if I could have the ticket very politely, and we didn't do anything to force or pry. Sarah in NO way said that she'd force Callie to give me her ticket. It went along the lines of:

""Hi, Callie, I totally know this is a long shot, and you don't have to if you don't want to, but I  was wondering if Ivory could maybe have your ticket for the concert so we'd be able to go together? You totally don't have to, just asking.""

Sarah was very nice about it, but Callie replied to it, basically cussing Sarah out, saying ""Why do you care about friends other than me right now? I thought you'd have some sympathy for me"" , and she basically told Sarah to eff off and stuff. 

Afterwards, Sarah apologized profusely, but to no answer.

The next day, Callie calls Sarah over, just to say: ""I don't want to be friends with you anymore, delete my phone number off your phone. Oh yeah, Ellie was right about you.""

That was a low blow. Ellie is a HORRIBLE person. She made fun of Sarah during her ED, she literally BEAT her once, she called Sarah toxic, and so much more. 

Sarah is one of the sweetest people I know.

I obviously felt horrible, part of it was my fault, but Sarah insisted on asking Callie for the ticket, and I thought it would do no harm.

But I also thought that Callie was blowing this WAY out of proportion, so the next day, I walked straight up to her, told her off, for everything she's done, not just the Sarah thing, with includes:

-making a rumor about me and lying to people that I stuffed my bra, then saying it was because she had a crush on me

-calling me fat on numerous occasions

-making fun of me because I'm autistic

-made up a rumor that I was homophobic and ableist (What, im literally pan and autistic?)

-pressuring me into kissing her at a sleepover

The host provides some beverages and like pizza or whatever and we all bring some dessert or snack or something.

Before we got married we consulted a lawyer about what choices we had. We opted to do the route for a green card because he needs to be able to legally work because I will eventually be going back to school. We have been together for over 5 years when we got married. We were ready!  My relationship was kept secret for very long besides from my mother because of the fear of what my father would do if he found out. He is abusive. He found out in 2021. He rejected everything because my husband is not from the USA and because my husband is darker and his first language is Spanish. Being that I was keeping my relationship a secret from my father I was also keeping it hidden from my family up until my dad found out. I did not need people in my family telling my dad and making my life at home worse than it already was. People often have this misconception that my dad will just have to accept it but don’t understand the misery I would have to endure at home with the fighting, the name calling, the control, and etc. I was still very guarded about our relationship after it had come out that we were dating. We got married in his country and started the journey of getting his green card. The wedding was for my husband’s family (most will never be able to travel out of their home country) and also to start the process. Here is why I am asking if AITA because it came out this Christmas that we got married because I put my married name on something public (I know I should not have but I am/was excited)  My g-parents (my mom’s) were furious they were not notified of my wedding. I explained that this wedding was for my husband’s family and not mine and that my own mother was not at the wedding and the wedding was not even planned me it was planned by my husband’s fam because I was in a whole different country and finishing up my bachelors degrees. I thought that this was the end of them being mad because I had explained that we wanted to have our big wedding in the states, but today I went over to my g-parents house 4 months later and my g-pa found a photo of my wedding posted on my MIL facebook or something My g-parents exploded and stated that they did not understand why they did not get at least notified of my wedding. I explained it again, but then because my mom had wanted to invite my g-ma to venue shop with us for our wedding in the US earlier this year my g-ma screamed at me that I had made her look stupid to the venue people and my husband’s family must think they are dog shit because they did not go to the wedding. I got up and walked out and told them I was leaving my g-ma said “good”. I yelled out  that they play favorites and my uncle’s kids are always valued more. My g-parents yelled at me to “suck it up”. I left. I understand that I did not invite them but the wedding was not for them. It was for my husband’s family.

Here is why I am asking if AITA because it came out this Christmas that we got married because I put my married name on something public (I know I should not have but I am/was excited)  My g-parents (my mom’s) were furious they were not notified of my wedding. I explained that this wedding was for my husband’s family and not mine and that my own mother was not at the wedding and the wedding was not even planned me it was planned by my husband’s fam because I was in a whole different country and finishing up my bachelors degrees. I thought that this was the end of them being mad because I had explained that we wanted to have our big wedding in the states, but today I went over to my g-parents house 4 months later and my g-pa found a photo of my wedding posted on my MIL facebook or something My g-parents exploded and stated that they did not understand why they did not get at least notified of my wedding. I explained it again, but then because my mom had wanted to invite my g-ma to venue shop with us for our wedding in the US earlier this year my g-ma screamed at me that I had made her look stupid to the venue people and my husband’s family must think they are dog shit because they did not go to the wedding. I got up and walked out and told them I was leaving my g-ma said “good”. I yelled out  that they play favorites and my uncle’s kids are always valued more. My g-parents yelled at me to “suck it up”. I left. I understand that I did not invite them but the wedding was not for them. It was for my husband’s family.

But he always asks for favours immediately afterwards, like asking me to do yard work for him, or asking to take flowers from my garden.

Maybe I really am the asshole, but I really like my other neighbours, and this guy gives me a bad vibe. He also always has something bad to say about the other neighbours on the block, which makes me afraid not to do the favours he asks because of what he might say about me. 

EDIT: I need to clarify, the issue I'm having is that my wife accepts the gifts, not knowing that he will always ask me for favours afterwards.

She kept trying to get me to just buy the business class tickets for 15 mins, and I just decided I didn't want to go anymore, I walked away and told her that she can decide for herself, I will decide when I want to go.
Later on, she decided to buy economy tickets with my dad, and told me to buy my tickets, but I just told her that I am not buying the tickets, as I don't want to go on the trip anymore.

23,1cw3oi4,AITA for not pushing daughter to follow the path her deceased mother envisioned for her?,"I am a father to a 22-year-old daughter; we lost her mom to a DUI in 2018. Her mom was very career oriented and always pushed her to go to college and have a high-paying job, she also bought all of her clothes and made sure she looked presentable. After her mom died, her grades began plummeting out of control to where she risked not passing most of her classes. I had tried filling that role to give her that push, but it only made her more distant and stubborn.

 

She grew very resentful and depressed to where I feared I'd lose her too. It was a very emotionally turbulent period, but she eventually opened up and revealed that she felt lost because she spent her whole life following her mom’s expectations, and now that she was gone didn’t feel like she had any direction or identity of her own to go forward.

 

After that my main priority shifted towards helping her discover herself and find autonomy, and part of that included going to the mall and giving her the freedom to choose whatever she wanted to wear. She gravitated towards more outlandish styles than anything her mom had ever chosen for her: fishnet, leather, plaid skirts, belts, etc. and started experimenting with vibrant hair color and styling it into mohawk. I figured it was a phase, but she really found herself in this identity and now of days makes a lot of her own designs and gets excited to send me pictures of herself when she makes a new fashion that she wants to share with me.

 

This change put her in a much better place emotionally, but her grades never returned to what they once were. She got rejected by the colleges she had applied for and that's around when the pandemic hit, so she opted out of pursuing college. I said she could stay with me for as long as she needs, and she's still here to this day.

 

The conflict: her maternal grandmother called me the other day. I guess someone had posted a photo at a protest on social media that my daughter could be seen in, and that set her off on me. She claimed that I betrayed the memory of her daughter and that her grandkid should have been graduating college this year and moving out on her own with a good man. That because she now looks like a delinquent, she’s ruined any chance of having a stable life, a respectable job, or a good husband. That she's been set up for failure, doesn't surround herself with people who will push her to grow, and will be stuck living with me. That I should have taken charge instead of letting her make these decisions for herself when she was so young, vulnerable, and confused.



Her words have been eating away at me and left me questioning if there’s merit. I do have doubts and worry about her being well off and having enough security for the future, and she has missed opportunities because of how she presents herself, but I am still proud of who she has become.

Every single night for about 3 years now our dog, scout, has slept with me. The side of my bed is right against my window and she loves to sleep with her head out my window ( don’t worry, it’s only open enough just so she can get her head out, there is no way she could fall out and we live in a very safe town on a very quiet street). My bed has now become her favorite spot in the house. Everyday when I’m at school she’ll just be on my bed looking out the window at everything happening outside. 	
Tonight, when my mom came to say goodnight to me and Scout she told me her plan for when I go off to college. She told me that my sister, who is 16 months younger than me and only one grade behind, will be moving into my room when I go off the college. My current room use to be hers, it is the bigger room, and about 2 years ago we switched for many reasons. My mom said it was so Scout would still have someone to sleep with at night. But I reminded her that Scout is too scared to get on my sisters bed because it has a giant mattress pad so she can’t jump up or jump down, and even when someone does lift her up it’s way to squishy for her to walk on it. Then my mom told me that Scout wouldn’t be sleeping in her bed, she would be sleeping on a dog couch they buy her. I got upset because I don’t want all my stuff moved when I go to college.

I am a 17 year old girl going into my senior year of high school. Obviously, it’s a big year for me as graduation is coming up and I am very excited. I am in the top 5% of my grade and I have worked super hard to ensure that I can get almost all of my college payed for when I leave. Graduation is a huge milestone for me and I want it to be special for me. 

Enter my mom. Ever since I was born she always looks for way to spend less and less money. I would get clothes from family members and if I ever wanted anything, whether it be a new toy, gaming console, etc., it would always have to be a hand me down or refurbished or whatever. I don’t believe I am spoiled. I understand that money is tight and the current state of the economy and all that makes everything expensive. But sometimes I just wish I got something new and not have to worry about the cost or get clothes or items and have stuff that someone else has worn/used. 

Today I went downstairs and my mom showed me the gown she got for my twin sister. I was very confused as summer is just about to start and gown and cap sales don’t start until the school year does. She tells me that she bought that one from a parent whose kid graduated this year and she’s looking for my size now. I got very frustrated and went upstairs to think about what I wanted to do. I don’t know why this matters to me so much but it does. The thought of wearing a cap and gown that someone already walked across the stage with when I’ve worked so hard to become as successful as I am really frustrated me, and I dunno I just want to get a new gown that no one has touched.

I later texted her when I had a calm head and told her that I wanted a new gown for graduation and I’ll pay for whatever she doesn’t want to. She got mad at me and told me senior year is already too expensive and getting a used gown saves money and there’s no difference. I started to get frustrated again and listed out my reasons for wanting a new one but she just dismissed them and told me that she’s sorry I don’t agree with her but I will be getting a used gown. I honestly got really mad and told her then I’ll buy the gown myself and she doesn’t have to worry about it but she still was adamant about it, saying I have to save money for college and other expenses. I have a job and make plenty of money to cover anything thrown my way, plus my parents owe me $1750 bucks anyways. I just kinda ended the convo there after telling her that scholarships can cover my tuition and stuff. 

Now that I’m thinking about it, I’m not sure if I’m in the right and I think I may be acting like a spoiled brat but this really does matter to me and I wish she considered how I felt. So, AITA?

And just canceled all our plans and later on said he was gonna go for a walk and I asked to join, he dismissed me and left, dropped some groceries and then said he was gonna drive around and didn’t ask if I wanted to join. Honestly I cried because I felt so iced out (me and him are really close) but I feel like I’m at fault, I feel like the asshole because he’s acting cold to me for refusing the plan, but I feel like it’s my fault, am I the asshole here? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-20,"AITA for refusing a plan so my dad and I were going to go hiking today since he’s been asking me all week, but then his buddy asked if he wanted to go to a barbecue, I said I didn’t want to go and he could go by himself, but he just ended up saying since I said no he wouldn’t go either.

28,1cw2egu,AITAH for not paying for ALL of the cost of a graduation lunch?,"My daughter graduated today It was attended by close family..Consisting of  
Relevant - Me, Ex-wife, Ex-FIL  
Irrelevant - 4 current fam members, and 2 ex fam members.  
  
Me and Ex-wife divorced partly due to financial irresponsiblity  
My daughter got a free ride thru university, and my ex has been very much in charge of all my daughters finances.  
Neither parent has had to financially contribute towards my daughter during University. My daughter worked had grants for incidentals. I offered to assist, but I wanted full access to at least overview my daughters financial situation, and was met with resistance, and some stuff I frankly found to be shady, like Ex-wife insisting she was on daughters bank account. I have zero knowledge of my daughters finances, and any attempt to encourage my daughter to pull her own credit report etc has been met with excuses like ""I couldn't pull it because it had already been done for the year"" - I suspect there's some fiduciary malfeasance going on, but my daughter doesn't seem to care about it & her main focus has been getting thru Uni.  
  
Anytime my daughter has asked for money for gas, food, or just some money for pizza, I've sent it immediately, as I'm sure my Ex-wife has. Overall my general position has been strictly arms-length when it comes to anything to do with money and my ex wife.  
My ex has more than doubled her income since we divorced, and seems to be living within her means.  
  
After the graduation, we all went to daughters apartment and moved her stuff into our cars, and my Ex-wife had arranged a lunch at a nice little bistro place afterwards ($20-$50 a plate) as it was the only place that could seat a party of our size at that time. - I had no input on this other than ""cool!""

When it came time for the bill, rather than get into a complex split, I simply said ""I'll pay for the 5 of us"" (me, my daughter, and 3 current family members), and we split the bill that way.  
Apparently Ex-FIL picked up the tab for the other half.

The $ split was 75% / 25% with me picking up the 75% and the grand total for the whole table was just north of $330.   
  
On my return home I received a note from my EX-Fil. He was pissed that I had not picked up the whole tab.  
His reasoning was that family members had all traveled to see daughter graduate, helped her move out her apt and got her gifts & given her money. All for MY daughter.  
I immediately apologized, and explained that I had heard someone say ""split it 3 ways"" and I thought I was doing the right thing by paying for more than half the table. I immediately offered to give him the money but he didn't want it.  
  
I have zero experience with university graduations, let alone post-grad-lunches or the social etiquette regarding the billing thereof especially when it comes to Ex's and ex-family members, and so I wondered AITAH ?

I realize there is little to no resolve on this issue, the damage being already done, and I'll probably just treat my daughter with the money anyways :)",Not the A-hole,2024-05-20,"AITAH for not paying for ALL of the cost of a graduation lunch?
