0,1cxie4i,AITA for not inviting my aunt in law to my wedding?,"I'm relatively new to Reddit, I'm fairly certain this is how I format it.

Me (35M) and my fiance (32F) are getting married in October.

We have agreed my parents, her dad, my brother, my uncle, and my cousin will be at the wedding, we are having a small wedding with only a few non-family members. 

My uncle, (58M), has three kids, I will call them M (15M), T(21M) and B(21F).

Me and M are the closest, he's a little terror but I'm glad he's in my family. He recently came out to our family as transgender (Female to Male, I think thats right term) and no one was very surprised. He was always a tom boy, and over all never 'girlie'.

B is also trans, (Male to Female) and recently came out as well, but again, we weren't very surprised. 

B and T are twins, and were like two peas in a pod, when M was born, he joined their little group. The three of them have always been very close, and B and M came out to T first.

M is going to be flower boy, and he's going to wear a suit. T is going to be one of my grooms men, and B is going to be a brides maid.

The three of them are all matching, a detail we all find sweet.

But anyways, my uncle has a wife (58F) who is not the mother of any of the kids, they've been married for two years, and were dating seven years before.

My aunt in law will not play any part in our wedding, and will ot even be there.

She constantly dead names B and M, and is over all a jerk to M.

She is also rude toward me and my fiance, and most of our family. We have no idea what my uncle sees in her.

I'm going to have my cousin in my wedding, no matter what. Aunt In Law is mad she won't be there, but she knows exactly why.

She took M shopping for the wedding, and refused to let him get a suit, buying him dress instead. M came to me and my fiance crying at the engagement party (a few days after they went shopping) because Aunt in law wouldn't let him wear a suit, and demanded he wear a dress.

It been a few months since the party, and we have everything planned out.

My aunt is law will arive, but she won't be allowed in, my Best Man, who is my brother, will get M, T, and B into their outfits.

Aunt in law is throwing a fit over this, blowing up fiance and mine's phones, aswell as my mom and dad's.

1,1cxgx15,AITA the asshole for threatening to go to HR?,"I don’t know if it’s the pregnancy hormones or if I’m just pissed because I already can’t stand this person, but here we are. I need an outside opinion because in the office, most of our colleagues don’t want to get involved (understandable).

I’m six months pregnant. We don’t know the sex of the baby because we want to keep it a surprise. In our culture, there’s a custom where we name our babies after family or close friends who have since died. The idea is that they will gain the good qualities of the deceased with the hope they will gain an interest in who they were and, in a greater scope, our family and cultural heritage.

We want to name the baby after my grandfather, who had a Y name. We’re thinking Yosef for a boy or Yael for a girl. 

My coworker Casey thinks I’m doing my future baby a disservice. She thinks I’m an asshole for burdening my child with someone else’s name and that they should have their own name. In addition she keeps bugging me with hypotheticals like what if my child wants to change their name or if they come out as trans. The answer is, either don’t care or the chances of it happen are low that it probably might not happen.

I’ve tried to explain that we’re not naming my baby after my grandfather. They will just share the same initial. Casey doesn’t listen. 

Anyway, I’m having lunch when Casey is buggering me about my baby’s name. I tried to shut it down by threatening to go to HR for harassment. 

That shut her up for now, but my cubicle mate and a few others in the department think I’m taking it too far when HR has other problems to deal with. I also ask because Casey got really upset with me and begged me not to go to HR, which makes me think there’s more going on I don’t know.

2,1cx4p9c,AITA for telling my friend's friend that she was overstimulating my sensory disorder?,"I feel like I may have ruined a friendship, i know my friends said it wasn't my fault, but I feel like if I'd just shut up, I wouldn't have ruined it

So I have a sensory disorder and adhd, so depending on my day, literally anything can make me over stimulate myself and cry so bad to the point I'm hyperventilating

And a few days ago, me and my friends were hanging out, and one of my friends invited this girl I barely know which I'm fine with because they go way back

And I was kinda getting overwhelmed already, but I'm used to that when I'm hanging with friends, I know how to deal with it, but the girl was pushing my limits

She was sitting next to me on the couch, and she kept getting very close to me while claiming she had no room (she had room) to the point I was pushed against the arm rest because I didn't want anyone touching me, especially when I'm already overwhelmed, and everyone knows this, that's why they try to keep a distance when I seem overwhelmed

A few of my friends did try to explain to her that I don't like being touched by people I don't really know, or when I'm overwhelmed, but she didn't really listen and I just told them it's fine and moved to the floor, which I like sitting at better anyways

Now I don't know if she had personal beef with me or if she just didnt realize her actions, but for some reason she seemed like she was doing certain things just to mess with me

Later she was eating pizza and she was chewing so loudly with her mouth wide open and it was nearly sending me to tears because of the noise and the fact that I could see her chewing the food that fell out of her mouth, and she would not stop, but once again I just tried to ignore her because she's new and doesn't know about my disorders

Now after a bunch of back and forth of her doing things that messed with me and was starting to make me cry, I explained in detail that I have adhd and a sensory disorder so if she could just tone herself down and not do certain things, thatd be find, but she said no and told me I was to depressed to have adhd, which made my friends mad

My friends started arguing with the girl, including her friend that invited her, who argued with her the most, the girl said that people with actual adhd are always happy while I looked like an emo tr*nny who was trying to hard which really, really sent my friends off (I'm ftm trans btw)

I love my friends for coming to my aid, but I feel selfish, and snobby for telling the girl to stop, and it got worse when the girl's friend fully ended their relationship

I know my friend was really good friends with the girl and I feel so bad, i know she said it was fine and she doesn't want to be friends with someone who disrespects her friends, but I just feel like this could have been avoided and that it's just disorders, I should be able to get over a little noise and a few touches

We met super young and just had a bond. For some background my ex friend who I'll call B is chronically online. They revolve their whole life around the internet and the people they meet. I didn't have a problem with this until recently. B is transgender FtM and has dozens of Facebook accounts where they tend to post soft core 🌽 of themselves. Awhile back they made a post asking people who wanted to be hidden from their content. I told them I had their accounts unfollowed due to issues with Facebooks notifications not turning off for me. I'd like to mention I have every single person on my account unfollowed for this same reason. Family, friends, pages etc. A few people said my response was rude and hateful. I explained why I said what I said but it still wasn't enough. A few hours later my comment was removed. Several days go by and I noticed while looking for Bs account to message them that I couldn't find it nor could I locate about 22 other individuals. I panicked and checked my block list and saw all 23 people had been randomly blocked. While in the middle of unblocking people my account suddenly signed out. I begin freaking out and tried to contact B another way but I was removed on everything. Upon looking at my email I found that my FB had been reported 176 times. I contacted support and they provided me what had been reported and why. When I asked why had people been blocked Fb support claimed it was similar to when I report someone and can block them but the opposite as well as something they took into their hands until they could investigate the claims made against me. I tried contacting Bs family and tried to explain to them what had happened but they didn't seem to care. 

Several weeks go by and I still haven't gotten my account back but I started getting messages from people I didn't know claiming to be friends with B. These messages ranged from threats of doxing, calling CPS, getting my partner involved, and most recently to off myself. I was called transphobic for not wanting to support Bs *orn stuff. The list goes on. I kept ignoring and blocking people but it's just gotten the point I can't anymore. I don't wanna believe B knows this is happening but any attempt to reach them is ignored or met with hostility from others. My only opinion is to reach out to Bs parents again and explain to them what's been going on so that maybe B will contact me and I can stop all of this.

4,1cwyazs,AITA for telling my husband he ruined my birthday ,"Today is my (F) 35th birthday. In general I don’t love my birthday because growing up my parents would always throw us parties and fight and complain about how expensive they were, etc. So basically I feel like celebrating myself is a burden. Anyway, I’ve been happier to celebrate it these past few years because I’m trying hard to allow myself to. 

I am married and have two kids (5, 9). Four days ago I had surgery to remove a 9cm endometrioma from my ovary. Doctor was supposed to also remove my ovary but couldn’t because it’s fused to my bowels and abdominal wall. I feel pretty exhausted, still have some pain, still mentally dealing with knowing there’s more to come. I also recently lost my job because the hospital system I worked for closed its mental health clinic. Basically I could really use a win. (Thankfully have another job lined up, just waiting to fully recover to start!)

Anyway, my husband has to take the kids to school this week despite me being unemployed because I can’t lift our five year old if necessary and I’m still iffy on driving. This morning I woke up to him fighting with her because she wanted me to get her ready and she was refusing to go to school.  That’s a whole other topic but I came downstairs to diffuse the situation. Was downstairs for a half an hour- No one wished me a happy birthday. Ultimately my daughter wouldn’t get ready and my husband decided it was easier to let her stay home with me and call her out of school than put forth the effort to get her ready and to school because I could just deal with her. I was fucking PISSED. 

I am exhausted. I am in pain. I need to rest. Can’t do that with a five year old at home. I just wanted to read, nap, lay out, all of which is what I should be doing to recover. Plus I just wanted to have a day of peace to myself on my birthday after all of the shit life has thrown at me lately. 

His attitude got even worse tonight and I told him I was sick of it and I was disappointed he ruined my birthday. He didn’t take that well.  AITA for being pissed he left her home, continued to be negative (like every word that came out of his mouth was a complaint), and telling him he ruined my day?

EDIT: HIS attitude lead HIM to yell at and be just overall unpleasant to our kids. All morning. All evening. I understand things are stressful but that’s why we have frustration tolerance. 

Not blaming him for job loss, not blaming him for surgery. I am also aware he is impacted by these things, especially considering I am the primary breadwinner and make ~30% more money than he does. It’s stressful for both of us for sure. 

He also usually gets them ready for and takes them to school two days a week when I’m working so this is nothing new to him. Some mornings are still rough for either of us. This would actually have been his normal day to take them and never once has he allowed her to just stay home. So because I was home it was decided she could “just stay with me” rather than manage her behavior. Her staying home meant I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t take pain medication, had to manage meals (something I’m otherwise obviously capable of doing but still struggling to do even for myself at this point because I’m so tired and still in a lot of pain) and entertainment all while also trying to not positively reinforce her staying home (which was already done when she was allowed to stay home).

6,1cwy4rc,WIBTA For dropping out of my friends Disney cruise wedding?,"So I (19F) have been invited to my friends (20F and 20M) wedding, which is supposed to happen in September. Of course hearing the news of the wedding, I was ecstatic! The news of the wedding being on a Disney cruise was also exciting.

I accepted the invite immediately, as I am close with the two (in fact I am one of the bridesmaids.) Since the news of the wedding being on a cruise happened back in November, I thought saving would be no problem. 

I work part time, and I quit my old job back in December, and due to unforeseen circumstances I have made much less money than I was before. 

Throughout the months the bride and groom have been urging for the payments more and more. They are aware of my financial situation and have offered solutions, such as a payment plan and an extension, even going so far to allow me to pay back after the wedding. 

Recently however, as the date draws near and my search for a better paying job grows bleak, I am starting to realize that I may not be able to afford to attend the wedding. My friend also recently dropped out of the wedding which I’ve been informed that they are rather upset, because that means they have to pay more money. They also promised her that she could pay after the wedding which they are now claiming was a misunderstanding, which I can confirm was not as I was there when they said that. The brides mom even texted my mom to help pay for me after I mention I wouldn’t be able to afford a monthly payment, even after I mentioned I was going to be getting more work soon and would most likely to be able to pay her in full.

The brides mom even texted my mom to help pay for me after I mention I wouldn’t be able to afford a monthly payment, even after I mentioned I was going to be getting more work soon and would most likely to be able to pay her in full.

The due date is June 1, which is where I may be the asshole, since it is very last minute and they would have to pay me back any money I’ve given them. 

So WIBTA to drop out of my friends wedding last minute?",1.0,0.103861704,0,0
7,1cwy01n,AITA taking care of my sister's cat and not dropping off her keys afterwards ,"I (29F) was asked(TOLD) by my sister (23F) to take care of her cat Saturday-Monday. She left on Friday. I've done it before and I usually stop by once a day and give him food. Mondays are my busiest and I wasn't able to go. I work until 5. By the time I ate, showered, and relaxed a little, it was already 6:30. I told her I probably wasn't gonna be able to go, I also thought it would be fine since she was gonna get there at 8:30. Anyway, she got mad and demanded I drop off her keys and told me that was ""disgusting behavior"" for letting her cat starve. I told her that I probably wasn't gonna leave my home but that she could come pick up the keys. She then got mad called me lazy, disgusting, etc. I take full responsibility for not feeding the cat today after I said I would. When I took care of the cat before I didn't have a job, I didn't anticipate how busy, overwhelmed, and exhausted I'd be adding his feeding to my workday schedule. 🥴
AITA for not feeding him today (Monday)? AITA for not dropping of the keys?

EDIT: 
INFO
Firstly, I decided not to go because she would've been home around the time I was gonna be able to go. If she were to come back say Tuesday, I would've gone over around 7-8, which is when I was probably gonna be ready to leave the house. That's why I thought it wasn't a big deal not to go.
Secondly, this cat used to live at my house. He knows our pets and is quite comfortable here. I've offered in the past that she bring the cat over here so he's not alone and it would be easier to take care of him. She just flat out refuses.
Finally, I really was looking for more opinions on the key situation. In my mind, the cat situation was never the primary issue since he was going to be fed no matter what. I was seeking clarity over whose responsibility it was to pick up/drop off the keys.

She pays for pretty much everything (which she said she was totally fine with before I moved in with her), I do have a part time job and contribute but it's not a lot. So I try to do most of the cleaning and chores and stuff.

Anyways I started dating this girl I met in class (f21) and after meeting her my sister was not a fan. She's never really approved of any of my girlfriends I've ever had (which really sucks since I do care a lot about her opinion and I want her to get along with whoever I'm dating). My sister REALLY doesn't like this girl though, and I have no idea why... but this past weekend she (my gf) was going to pick me up and we were gonna go out for dinner and go to some bars after.

My sister saw me starting to get ready and stuff, and she asked me where I was going. I told her the truth and she got really pissed off at me. I told her I wasn't gonna try to drink at the bars (since I have a fake ID and she knows that) but that we were just going to hang out with some other people we knew. But she didn't care, and then told me to text my gf and tell her that the plans are off, since I wasn't going anywhere. 

I hate arguing with her and I always try to listen to her and show her a lot of respect, but I was mad and said that wasn't fair, and that she shouldn't be controlling me like that and that I should have the right to go out if I wanted to. She just got even more angry, and said that she's making me stay in because she knows what's best for me and that she is only looking out for me.

Then she took it a step further and said that she strongly suggests I break things off with this girl (we've only been dating for a few weeks) and she said that she's bad news and I just can't see it. But I feel like that's what she always says. But to be fair she has been right in the past.

Finally I just gave in (since I didn't feel there was any way I was gonna change her mind), texted my gf that I wasn't feeling well and needed to cancel our date (which I hated doing since I was lying 😞 but I was too embarrassed to tell her the real reason), and I stayed in my room listening to music pretty much the whole night.

My wife comes from a blended family where she splits major holidays between both parents (ex. Christmas, Thanksgiving) although neither parent lives in the same city. She is the youngest of her father’s kids. Her older sister has an unhealthy relationship with her. It's a mixture of attachment/bullying in my opinion. A major part of the relationship is my wife being her “little sister” although they are less than a year apart. 

Every holiday her sister blows her up badgering her on when she will get to her dad’s. Although the routine has been the same the entirety of our relationship. We start at her mom’s and eventually migrate to her dad’s in the second half of the day. This past thanksgiving at her dad’s was a potluck format for which my wife was responsible for getting the drinks. Knowing she splits the holidays she tasked another family member also responsible for drinks to get enough for which she paid her. Like clockwork on the morning of thanksgiving her sister starts her routine and my wife told her more or less “I took care of the drinks but I expected this either way”. Fast forward to our arrival at her dad’s and her sister did not say a word to either one of us for the duration of our stay which was overnight and well into the following day. They did not speak for months as my wife had finally decided to stand up for herself as she had done nothing wrong. 

Her sister has a birthday tripped planned in the summer that started the planning process well before thanksgiving. Around March she started weaseling her way back in with my wife as though nothing happened. And their relationship started to rekindle as though nothing happened at all. We attended an event in support of another family member which her sister also attended in March. Her sister proceeded to continue to not speak to me but did converse with my wife. 

Fast forward to Saturday in which we attended a birthday dinner for my wife’s step mom and her sister’s trend of not speaking to me continued. The following day at brunch I let my wife know that I don’t intend to be around her dad’s side of the family in the near future as the disrespect had finally gotten to me. I had to drop the conversation because I knew it was one we could not continue without her crying which she had started to do.

I’m at a loss because asking your spouse to stand-up for you when you have done nothing wrong doesn’t seem like a tall ask. I don’t let my own sisters disrespect me in this manner so it is becoming tough on me. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for telling my wife I don't want to be around her sister? **Am I the asshole for feeling I'm deserved an apology from my sister-in-law and telling my wife I don't intend to be around her sister any longer?

16,1cwx5fc,AITA for telling my best friend I don’t want to third wheel anymore?,"I (23m) recently told my best friend (25m) that I didn’t want to be the third wheel every time we hang out. Little bit of backstory, we have been friends for going on three years at this point but since his last relationship, everything we do and every conversation we have must include his gf. This was never an issue before until he got into this relationship in January of last year. She immediately moved in and wanted to read all of our texts, all phone calls had to be on speaker, and I couldn’t be around him without her present. She didn’t like how much he divided his attention between her and his friends, especially me. If we hung out (which we used to do every day), we could only do what she wanted because she would throw a fit and want to go home if we wanted to do anything different. I ended up on bad terms with her due to us continuing to hang out and talk even though she told him he needed to “get rid of his social life” for her to be happy. Eventually she started rumors within his family and with our friends that led to us not speaking anymore. They have since broken up and things had went back to normal with us. 
We ended up moving in together not too long ago for financial reasons and things were going well. He’s started dating again and the issue has came back up. We’ve been arguing because according to him, I don’t talk to his gf enough or go out with them enough. I try to be friendly but we have nothing in common so we don’t normally have full conversations. The biggest argument has been if I ask to hang out when she isn’t here. She hasn’t moved in but stays here most nights. Lives an hour and a half away. When I ask him to go out to eat or catch him out of his room and just try to hang out in the living room on nights she isn’t here, we end up arguing because I didn’t go out to eat with them when she was here or would leave the room when they got too touchy. We talked last night and I tried to explain my POV. I don’t always want to third wheel with them. I shouldn’t have to wait for a day that she’s here to ask something as simple as going to Walmart with me. I thought giving them time to go out by themselves when she is here would be appreciated. It didn’t go over well and now he’s saying it’s weird that I ask him to do things when she isn’t here. She also doesn’t like it. He’s threatening to move out because of it. 
For context, yes I do go out with them sometimes, just not all the time. I wasn’t raised to see dudes hanging out as weird but it’s weird to him if he has a gf and we do anything without her present.

18,1cwx472,AITA for raising my (27F) voice to my partner (23M),"To begin with, I am extremely crippled by my action. I am here because my guilt is eating me up and I know I'm a terrible person. However, I just need to know if it's a complex situation and if I should give more grace to myself. For context, I am recently engaged and will get married next year to my kind partner. 

I am facing problems with my dad as he separated from my mom a few years ago. My father is making it harder for me to plan the marriage. I was stressed, and I vented to my partner. Instead of supporting me emotionally, my partner insinuated that perhaps it was a sign from the gods that our marriage was not blessed. He's thinking that there's somebody better for me out there. My partner is a very sensitive person compared to me. I'm pragmatic, but I fear it makes me tone-deaf and unempathetic in this situation. 

Therefore, I know he said those things to me because he internalised my problems with my dad, but it hurt me really bad. I asked him to stop talking, fearing it would hurt me more, and he kept talking over me. Out of frustration, I accidentally raised my voice and said, ""Goodness, stop!"" I was stunned by it and silenced myself afterwards. I called him and apologised properly, but I know he needs to heal from what I've done. I've messed up big time by hurting him, and trust me, I am so disappointed in myself. I used to believe that I was a calm, rational and logical person. I would not even hurt a fly, but I raised my voice at my partner, the person I love the most. Why am I a walking paradox? 

Before he went to sleep, after I apologised earlier, he texted me about how much I had hurt him and he never expected it to come from me. He asked me to stop discussing this issue as he doesn't want to remember this horrible day anymore. I usually would not communicate my side of the story as I don't want to make the situation worse, but before getting ready to work, I wrote him long messages explaining that I was feeling unheard and I accidentally raised my voice to ask him to listen. I was not trying to gaslight him, but I explained his actions that led me to it. I tried telling myself that communication is essential and I can speak about my feelings, but I am so scared.

fast forward to recently, i have taken off a couple days before my birthday this year to celebrate and was hoping he could come celebrate too. he’s able to come and is going to be done with work by then but says he cannot because he needs to be home for father’s day. all of my birthday celebrations in which id love for all my loved ones to be there will be jun 14-16 but he’s adamant on not coming because of father’s day & says he’ll make it up after. although i appreciate his willingness to make it up after, i can’t help but feel hurt once again because he’s not able to adjust or sacrifice a little bit of his family time (he lives w his parents) in order to celebrate w me on my day. am i being selfish or emotionally immature? the only reason i expect this level of dedication is because id do the same for him. please let me know if this is childish or unreasonable thank you.

21,1cwwpxz,AITA for nitpicking about my friend’s novel? ,"My friend recently wrote a novel, and asked me to read and critique it, both in terms of grammar mistakes as well as plot points/writing.

One critique I had was that one character is 5’5, yet is described as pocket-sized, tiny, short, etc numerous times throughout the plot. The character in question is a woman, and for a woman, I don’t think 5’5 is short enough to warrant being called tiny, it’s not even particularly short for a woman. So I stated she should either change the character’s height or the description that she’s particularly short.

According to my mom, my sister and her boyfriend James (22M) were talking and my sister told him that she would not play softball next year but then later told my mom that she would think about maybe playing again. I suppose my mom relayed this to James when they were having a text conversation because my parents will be friends with mine and my sister's SO's and talk to them regularly.

She did not see the text until after the game was over and they won, and she started bawling. Fast forward a day or two and I call my sister to try and comfort her and as I was talking to her, she continually blamed herself, saying that James did nothing wrong and that she had lied to him. I tried consoling her saying that changing her mind is not the same as outright lying, and I called him an asshat. She stated that she had never said she would even consider continuing to play ball and always said she would not play after two years (she just finished her second year). Fast forward another two days and she calls me asking me to apologize to him for calling him an asshat if for nothing more than the understanding that he had dumped her in the middle of a championship game over text, and he had heard me call him that because he had been with her when I first called. She was crying and saying that he did nothing wrong and she had been lying to him the whole time. I initially refused to apologize for calling him an asshat, I will admit and apologize for making assumptions solely from the story my mom told me. She still insists that I apologize for the 'asshat' remark and when I told her no, she said ""fine then ruin my relationship"".

She did not see the text until after the game was over and they won, and she started bawling. Fast forward a day or two and I call my sister to try and comfort her and as I was talking to her, she continually blamed herself, saying that James did nothing wrong and that she had lied to him. I tried consoling her saying that changing her mind is not the same as outright lying, and I called him an asshat. She stated that she had never said she would even consider continuing to play ball and always said she would not play after two years (she just finished her second year). Fast forward another two days and she calls me asking me to apologize to him for calling him an asshat if for nothing more than the understanding that he had dumped her in the middle of a championship game over text, and he had heard me call him that because he had been with her when I first called. She was crying and saying that he did nothing wrong and she had been lying to him the whole time. I initially refused to apologize for calling him an asshat, I will admit and apologize for making assumptions solely from the story my mom told me. She still insists that I apologize for the 'asshat' remark and when I told her no, she said ""fine then ruin my relationship"". I said I would talk to him when I see him in person this weekend as I am flying home for my mom's birthday. I'm not sure whether he did break up with her or not or if they got back together. I still refuse to apologize for calling him an asshat. Am I the Asshole?",0.0,1.0016465,1,0
24,1cww8x0,AITA for not attending my best friend’s grandfather’s funeral?,"
My best friend of over 10 years grandfather recently passed away. I gave my condolences to her and messaged her my support. She initially responded, but then just stopped after telling us (our friend group) that she wasn’t okay. To my understanding, we all reached out separately to her after her message. None of us got a response from her, she went ghost. The friend group talked separately about ways to support her and we discussed attending the funeral, but we hadn’t heard anything from her and it felt intrusive to keep texting her. We all live in different states and her grandparents live in a different state than her. To be fair, I didn’t ask her for funeral details, but at the time it did feel intrusive to keep reaching out to her. I looked at social media and tried to google any details but didn’t find anything. 

By the time I saw the obituary online, it was the day of the funeral and too late to attend. I felt awful. Maybe a few days after the fact, she sends up a long text basically saying that she’s mad we didn’t attend the funeral and a small part of her thought we would surprise her there. That was the first time we heard from her. It’s been super weird since then. Later we had a conversation and she was very upset about all the ways life had gone wrong, I didn’t know that was how she felt as it’s hard to get information from her. I feel as though she is not acknowledging that she didn’t respond to any of us or ask us attend the funeral.  The conversation we had went left because it seemed like everything I said only upset her more. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for not attending my best friend’s grandfather’s funeral?

26,1cwvh8d,AITA for wanting to move out?,"Hello,

I'm 21F and I just graduated last Thursday, with a job lined up starting in a month. I currently live with my mother who is deaf and mute. It's just us two because I lost my dad in January.

I've always been wanting to move out because of many reasons: Needing independency, having a life of my own, but also I just can't stay here anymore. My mom can lash out verbally on me about things that I didn't cause, do, or can't control, and it's been hurtful but I'm always pressured to ""understand"" because that's the way that she is. For the past 8 years I've always gotten angry treatment from her and I've grown to be insecure, scared, and not confident in myself. I'm also pressured to almost be her caregiver in a way that I always translate for her, work on her appointments and papers for her, etc. I helped her with getting life insurance, doing taxes, doctor appointments, and more. There's even been times that I skipped school and work for her because I had no choice. And not once, did she thank me for what I've been doing. 

With that being said, I told one of my aunts that I wanted to move out. I thought she would understand. Plus it was just an idea that I wanted to express so that they're not too surprised. But what was first a ""message to express myself and let you know"" turned into an argument. I first expressed myself neutrally, told them I'll just be in the same town so I will still support my mom financially and help out with the bills. Told them I wanted to be more independent because I still depend on my mom nowadays on many things. Moving out will force me to figure things out on my own- which is what I want to do.

But my aunt didn't respond very well. For example, I was told things like ""Now that you graduated you want to escape from your mom because you think she's toxic and she's unhealthy for you and she's a burden to you"", ""I thought you're grown now and matured, and I thought you'll be understanding your mom because you studied psychology but you're only concerned about validating your own feelings and goals, and being away from your mom"", ""I trusted you that you'll be taking care of you mom but maybe they're right, you shouldn't be trusted you'll just leave your mom"", ""It's just you and your mom now, she just lost your dad and she has a disability and you're gonna leave her?"" and many more that I'm just exploding at this point but also wondering if I was in the wrong.

AITA for wanting to move out at all? Considering that my mom is a widow, has a disability, needs help with many things.

  
TLDR; 21F fresh college graduate wanting to move out in 6 months-1 year, family upset because I'll be leaving my mom alone who is a widow and has deafness, is mute. Argument goes wrong and I came out of it feeling wrong and guilty, family talked about how I owe my mom and helping her shows respect and gratitude.

27,1cwv7or,AITA Pregnant and husband stressed,"I am 37 weeks pregnant with our second child. First kid is a wild, active, precocious, fairly difficult (I think so anyway) 17 month old boy. Lately I have been feeling slower and sicker just as the pregnancy nears the end, tons of uncomfortable false contractions that are caused by me handling our toddler mostly, so I haven’t been contributing as much as usual. For example, husband now gets up with our toddler in the mornings, does most of the grocery shopping and makes more meals than I do and he is visibly stressed out but I am physically exhausted and just not as able bodied as normal. Today I was at work (I’m a SpEd teacher so on my feet a lot) and felt like I was going to pass out (seeing stars, starting to sweat, feeling faint) and I stepped outside and sat down and tried to keep myself from fading out. I was mostly just embarrassed but also a bit panicked and my thinking was clouded. I called my husband who is a nurse practitioner at an urgent care and was at work, and just gave him a brief run down and said I wasn’t feeling great. I wasn’t looking for him leave work or anything to pick me up, I was mostly just feeling sick and uncomfortable and scared and wanted some empathy and a calming presence and for someone to keep me distracted so I wouldn’t black out. 

My husband was busy at work and annoyed that I called, he yelled that he’s so fucking tired of me being sick, that he can’t wait for this all to be over with, and said with an attitude “idk what you want me to do” then started explaining how he had 40 patients in the waiting room and 3 ambulances waiting outside work etc. I hung up the phone and he never called or texted the rest of the day.

Work is over, he’s ignoring me and hasn’t acknowledged his behavior from earlier or said thanks for making dinner tonight etc. I just feel down about myself thinking I must be a burden for bothering him when I feel like I need support.

This isn’t the first time this has happened or that I’ve addressed that I’d like more compassion in times where I feel sick, and he just says he’s too burned out from work to show me any and I have to deal with it. 

AMITA for calling him during work today in a time of emotional need? 

Update: I confronted him and tried to be as empathetic as possible about how hard he works and how thankful I am that he has taken on extra parenting tasks but that he still hurt my feelings with the caustic response earlier, and he doubled down on how I don’t understand how difficult his job is compared to mine and how I don’t make enough money for the family and he can’t hold my hand through every time I feel sick or scared and that he’s not excited anymore to bring a new baby into the world in a few weeks. Also said that I’m using pregnancy as an excuse to not be as hard working as I could be. Just going to hope for a better day tomorrow.

My dad (66M) has run a roof plumbing business for 30 years. For the first 24 years, it was just him and occasionally an offsider during busy periods. I joined my dad six years ago while figuring out my next move and then decided to commit to the business. Before joining, I was a sport management grad and traveled the world.

Since joining the business, we’ve pivoted from just roof construction to roof maintenance and cleaning. We've grown from just my dad and me to over 25 employees. I love my dad and he was a good tradie, but he wasn’t focused on the business side of things. Before, he was making a good living for just himself, but since I joined, we’ve grown and become a lot more professional. This year, we’re targeting our first double-digit million revenue. Our profits are low because we’re focused on growth.

I never thought of the inheritance stage because my sisters and BIL are accountants, engineers, or lawyers who are very white-collar workers and wanted no part of the business. My sister (33F), an accountant, even told us we had to use another accountant because she didn’t have time to help with our taxes.

Unbeknownst to me, my dad has been telling my sister and BIL about our revenue target for this fiscal year. She is now interested in coming in as Managing Director to help professionalize the business. I was ambushed with this news at dinner. I laughed and was speechless. It turned into a nasty argument where I felt I was being patronized and told I couldn’t do what I’ve done in the last six years. She started saying our profits are too low for our revenue and we need to be addressing all these issues. She has never set foot in our warehouse.

I know this was my dad’s business, but to be honest, he was just a sole trader before I came. I changed our business model, made us a website, worked with an agency to launch our marketing campaigns, and was on the tools. When we moved from sole trader to a company, we issued two shares and each have one. I guess it was never a family business when we were struggling, but now that we’re successful, it’s a family business. I've been arguing with my dad, mum, and sisters.

31,1cwuyot,AITAH for telling my mom she is part of the reason my son won't be potty trained.,"Me and my kids are staying with my mom temporarily, I have a 4 year old son who showed very little interest in using the bathroom other then in a pull up. He starts kindergarten next year and won't be able to attend unless he is fully potty trained, which is understandable. So I made the decision to not put a pull up on him during the day, and only use one at night which also means I'm no longer buying the boxes just small packs, which is a savings. When I had told my mom my plan she did not object to it but just said ok. She does watch him while I work but anytime she takes him out she puts a pull up on him instead of him telling her he has to go to the bathroom. When I take him out I do not put one on him and he does just fine without. I do know this is not her responsibility to potty train him but it has gotten to the point he screams for a pull up. Quite frankly I am tired of buying them as they are extremely expensive, even the cheapest ones I can find. 





I had posted something to specify some things in the comments so I'm just going to post it here and add some things...
So to specify some things, I did not just start potty training him I introduced him to the potty at 1 I bought him his own potty to get him use to sitting on it. At 2 was when I started to potty train full time with him wearing pull ups a timer set for every 30 mins and I would have him sit on it, and he hated it, would sit there crying and screaming only actually going in it a few times. So yes I did back off a little bit I didn't want to traumatize him. 

While I don't pay her directly for babysitting I do pay for the groceries, do the grocery shopping, put gas in her car and pay whatever bills she wants me to pay for that month, I also do all the cleaning. Yes I know I should be paying some bills since me and my kids do live there i do not have a problem with that. 

I do have other kids but they are not younger they are older, he is the youngest. I did not have any problems with them potty training so this is a first for me.

Me and their father are not together, he is not able to watch him while I work, for various reasons.

I have tried to find other childcare, there is a wait list which he is on several of them. I did not just expect my mom to watch him just because I am staying there.",Asshole,2024-05-21,"AITAH for telling my mom she is part of the reason my son won't be potty trained. Me and my kids are staying with my mom temporarily, I have a 4 year old son who showed very little interest in using the bathroom other then in a pull up. He starts kindergarten next year and won't be able to attend unless he is fully potty trained, which is understandable. So I made the decision to not put a pull up on him during the day, and only use one at night which also means I'm no longer buying the boxes just small packs, which is a savings. When I had told my mom my plan she did not object to it but just said ok. She does watch him while I work but anytime she takes him out she puts a pull up on him instead of him telling her he has to go to the bathroom. When I take him out I do not put one on him and he does just fine without. I do know this is not her responsibility to potty train him but it has gotten to the point he screams for a pull up. Quite frankly I am tired of buying them as they are extremely expensive, even the cheapest ones I can find.

33,1cwupdp,AITA for asking my bf to appreciate things I do for him ,"Hi, myself 24f and bf 26m. Been together for almost 4 years but currently going through a rocky patch. 
It’s such a minor thing but is bugging me. My bf works long hours. He stayed at my house last night, I woke up an hour before him this morning at 5am to make him his lunch because he always says he doesn’t eat enough. It consisted of a meal, snack and a dessert but it was all homemade. 

All day he didn’t bother sending anything to acknowledge it until I promted to say ‘hope you liked your lunch’ to which he responded ‘yah it was lovely thank you’. 

It’d been bugging me so I sent a text in the evening saying 
‘it would be quite nice to get a message when you eat stuff that I make u, especially when I put a bit of thought and care into it ‘.  
Him - ‘Don’t start making this hard again’. 
Me - ‘I’m just telling u how I feel ‘. 
Him - ‘Well il tell you how I feel. Tired and over worked I’m sorry I didn’t text you but I haven’t exactly not been busy all day I don’t just sit on my arse and play on my phone I’ve been pricing jobs up all night’. 
Me - ‘I also made u breakfast last week and you never said anything’. 
Him - ‘I’m not coming down again if you’re just going to make me feel guilty’. 
Me - ‘when u sit and eat your food would be nice to know that u thought about me’. 
Him - ‘I eat my food and go back to work I don’t get 5 minutes to my self’. 
Me - ‘ ok sorry ‘. 
Him - ‘Speak to you tomorrow too much this is ‘. 
Me - ‘wasn’t asking for much. just some ✨appreciation ✨. night’.

34,1cwuo6i,AITA for planning a second vacation with other part of family?,"My immediate family(husband and kids) and I are going to the mountains this summer. I've been before, its nice. But my favorite vacation place is and always will be a small beach town my parents took us to every year when I was growing up. It's been 3 years since Ive been able to go. My parents have taken my kids, and we have gone to a different beach a couple times, but it's not the same for me.

We decided to go to the mountains this year because my husband and oldest child are both tired of beach trips. I get it, but this year I've been really itching to go. I discussed it with my husband and we agreed I would ask my parents if they were interested in going. I can't afford to take all the kids on 2 vacations, plus my dad will be recovering from surgery and had already said he couldn't take the kids on a vacation this summer, so it will just be me and my parents.

We have invited my siblings, my 2 brothers can't come, and my bil(sisters husband) cant come. My sister hasnt made up her mind yet. My sister is upset at the whole situation. I'm the youngest, and the only one with kids so far, and she has felt like our parents favor me. She is upset our parents agreed so easily to a kid free vacation, she says they would never agree to that with her. Our parents say she has never invited them on a kid free vacation. 

I suspect she attempted to organize trips and never specified her wish for kid free, and my parents wanted to take my kids. They are very ""everything is more fun with kids"" type. I suspect this time is easy for them because my dad wouldn't be able to handle kids this summer plus my kids are getting a really fun vacation already, so they don't feel like the kids will miss out.

My sister says me planning 2 vacations this way is an AH move, since I'm leaving my kids out of it, and highlighting how much our parents favor me. I wont deny that I am closer with our parents, and my kids are a big part of that, but I'm also the only one of us siblings who has always been willing to meet them half way, or go all the way, to spend time with them, even when spending time together meant driving over 12 hours one way. Our mom in particular is very anal about everything being as fair as possible, so I don't think there is that much favoritism, aside from grandparents wanting to spend a lot of time with grandkids. For what its worth, they have done several things with her and her husband without my kids or I, its not a situation where she only gets to spend time with them if my kids are involved.

35,1cwuhsm,AITA? I ruined a couple’s coffee date by bringing my dog around.,"I (M38) went to a coffee shop with my wife (F38) and dog (M1). My wife went in to order the coffee while I stayed outside with our dog because dogs are not allowed (edited:) inside. The outdoor seating area was small, with two tables that had two chairs each. At one of the tables was a couple in their late 50s or early 60s who had a small dog with them. 

As I walked closer, their dog was barking and growling at my dog. My dog is a Bernese Mountain Dog, tired from his walk, so he remained calm and did not react to the other dog. Truthfully, I figured that the dog would probably keep reacting this way, and I sat down at the table next to them.

Their dog continued barking at my dog, leading the man to give me a loud and sarcastic “thanks.” I pointed out to him that my dog was behaving, and they are not any other options. The conversation ended with him calling me an asshole, The conversation ended with him calling me an asshole and leaving. As they were leaving, my wife comes out of the shop with our coffee. She asked me what happened and I told her that I was dealing with entitled boomers. I said this loud enough to make sure that our conversation was no as they were leaving, my wife comes out of the shop with our coffee. She asked me what happened and I told her that I was dealing with entitled boomers. Petty me said this loud enough to make sure that I was overheard.

Another man had been walking down the street, and must have witnessed what happened, because he told me that he was sorry that y he other guy was being an asshole.  The shop owner came outside to ask what happens, and tried to remain professional and neutral. My wife is took my side in the situation.

I’ve had a reactive, aggressive dog in the past. To me, that meant that I had to limit situations like these by removing myself and my dog. While I was certainly petty, I believe essentially I was entitled to sit there just as much as anyone else, when it came down to it.

I understand that she may be upset about it, but I’ve seen every single one of her relationships beginning to end, I have consoled her through every last one and have seen her absolutely devastated and I don’t want to see her go through it again, so I guess not meeting him yet pushes that weight on my shoulder off for a bit. 

She has always introduced us to her boyfriend’s the day they start dating or before they even start dating, and by introducing them to us early on in the relationship, it has led to some conflicts, most notably when my sisters ex got aggressive once he moved in, which led to my nephews dad getting temporary full custody of him (I will not be sharing what happened). 

After explaining to her why I don’t want to meet him just yet, it only made her angrier and led her to say extremely hurtful things to me and she cancelled our internet because she is mad at me, only willing to turn it back on if I pay for the entirety of it, but I can’t pay for the entirety of it, I work less than 15 hours a week, I have a phone bill to pay, I pay for every streaming service, and I pay half of the internet bill, I make $14.20 /hr and I give her what I can to pay for any other bills, whereas she works two jobs, makes a baseline of $90 a day for just one of those jobs and makes a little under $17/hr for the other job. 

I think of her as a mother because our mom didn’t care to raise us and her opinion has always mattered to me more than anyone else’s. I don’t know what to do now that she won’t talk to me, it hurts more than it did when my mom kicked me out when I was 11. I cannot imagine a life where I don’t have her to go to but she said that she doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore and that I mean nothing to her and have never meant anything to her.

I don’t know what to do now that she won’t talk to me, it hurts more than it did when my mom kicked me out when I was 11. I cannot imagine a life where I don’t have her to go to but she said that she doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore and that I mean nothing to her and have never meant anything to her.

39,1cxk7n5,AITA for taking team photos for free?,"I (27f) started working as a teacher in a new school. I have many responsibilities, one of which is yearbook advisor. There is another teacher at the school who often takes team photos and other photos for school events. They have a side business in photography. They charge for students to recieve their photos.
Well I do something different. At my last school I took photos for prom for free and just sent digital copies to everyone. I suggested that I do this for my new school. I was told no because it will cut into this other teacher's business.
 Well a couple coaches found out I take photos and asked that I take their team photos. I told them due to my ethics (which I have always been told that it is unethical to make money off of photos for the school you work at) I take the photos for free, team, individual, whatever they would like. I later edit them and send everyone a folder with digital copies of all of the edited photos. 
Yes I knew this other teacher took photos. However these coaches came to me, and asked me todo so, without me offering first. The school already had me scheduled to take graduation photos anyways, so I did not think it was a big deal.
Well this other teacher started emailing coaches as to why they are no longer using them (several have told me they do not like the way this person takes photos anyways). I am short and sweet with photos usually takes 30 minutes or less to take individual and team photos. The biggest team this year was 13 people. With 4 separate team photo groups.
So AITA for taking photos for these teams?



Edit: I thought I would clear some things up. I am the art teacher, so I went to art school. I did tell the principal that these teams asked me to take photos for them, she said that was fine (she did not want ne to take prom photos). The school scheduled me to take graduation photos as part of one of my duties. I only told the principal about the way I take photos due to our conversation about prom.

Firstly, I never promised him a trip. Secondly, it was my money exclusively (we’ve been dating about 6 months and don’t live together as he has a kid).

I know people have strong opinions on Child Support. It’s for absent parents or whatever, he is a present parent for his child with his ex and still pays child support.
Maybe I’m being too anxious here.
I also don’t think they will receive this well…

Last weekend, Ally and her partner went out of town and asked me and my partner to watch their dogs for the weekend. We also have two dogs and we are happy to watch friends dogs, especially when friends agree to watch ours when we need it. 

Ally’s dogs are quite a bit older than our dogs and they have some special needs (insulin, eye drops, medicine, etc.). It’s a bit extra to do but it’s only for the weekend, so no big deal. Fast forward to Sunday, and their flight home kept getting delayed. Instead of getting in at 9, they would get in closer to midnight. Ally asked me if I would prefer it if she still picked them up that night or if she should come in the morning. Normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but my partner and I both had to be out of the house at 7 for appointments that morning, so letting out all 4 dogs and giving injections and medicine to their dogs while also keeping our dogs away from their food while they eat just seemed like too much to deal with so I said we’d prefer if they came that night. She said ok.

Then once they land, I get a text from Ally saying that they are tired from traveling and they have to wake up in a 5 hours to start work on a different time zone and if it’s ok if they pick up their dogs in the morning or if she should come get them now. I had stayed up waiting for them since I was under the impression they would be coming that night, so I said that our schedule was too chaotic in the morning and that it would be better if they came now since I had already packed up all their dogs’ stuff. I also live 7 minutes from the airport, so I didn’t think that was too much of a task for them.

Fast forward to today and Ally sends a message saying that she doesn’t think we are a good match for watching each others dogs based on the situation, and that we each should look for a different sitter in the future.

Obviously I was taken aback by that and said I think that there was a misunderstanding and lack of communication, and that I didn’t think such a drastic situation was necessary. She essentially said that she needs a sitter with more flexibility and that the “right thing to do” in that situation was to for me to offer to watch them longer from the beginning.

For some background information. Currently I am a competitive figure skater, and have been training at the same club for the last 3 years. I recently decided to move clubs since there was an opportunity for me at a club in a city not to far away. I decided to move after trying out for 2 weeks.

When I first started out at my current club everything was pretty good. I didn't fit in initially but eventually it was decently comfortable. The head coach and I weren't always in agreement but it wasn't the end of the world since I needed a place to train. Luck wasn't really on my side for the first 2 years as it was filled with injury and the inability to train. She didn't really like that and would always be against taking time off and her solution to everything was to keep training. It eventually wasn't working for me, when the first time in my career I did not make it to the national qualifier. I decided to take my training into my own hands with a different coach at the club who is less known with less of a reputation. We got a long and came from the same beginnings so it made it much easier for me to train with him. Things started going much better until he announced that he was going to be slowly leaving the club and coaching less days. It didn't matter much to me since I was could train on my own. My old coach barely spoke to me except for once in a while. It was when I started getting better when she finally said some things, complimenting my training. Not sure of her intentions but there was never a thought of her coaching me again. 

Once my old coach started his new schedule things did not change much accept for another coach who is a specialist in jumps decided to take his leave after getting frustrated with my old coach. This made it tough for everyone because he played a decent part in everyone's training. This was around the same time I decided to look for new places to train. She had no idea of this because I kept it pretty quiet. It was almost as if the move was meant to be because I got accepted into the University there, and the coach at the new club got back to me quickly. I let everyone know that I would be gone for 2 weeks to ""try out"" and come back after a week to get my things and then leave. 

After training there for a week, some of the skaters asked me what I thought of it. Of course when you're a bit high off of a new environment you are more likely to talk about the great things you experienced. I said some subjective things I liked better and objective things like how they had a jump specialist coach. Some of the things I liked because they benefited me as a Student Athlete since the schedule at the new club was more flexible. Word got around everyone of how I felt and my old coach did not like that.

When I got home after my second week, I went to skate at my old club for a week like I had explained. As I was warming up, my old coach went up to me to talk about what I said. Her words were along the lines of ""if you go out and trash the club, you are not welcome back."" I was a bit confused because I did not say anything that I would say constitutes trashing a place. Also stating that I was not allowed to skate because my coach was not there. She never had a problem with that until today. I also fought back a bit by stating that I am entitled to an opinion and if someone asks me then I'm going to tell the truth. She made it clear that I was not allowed to skate since my coach was not there. I did speak with management who sided with me saying I did nothing wrong since it is my opinion. They also stated that I am allowed on that ice since I paid for the program.

45,1cxj2oa,AITA for asking neighbor to re-home an aggressive cat?,"I live in a duplex in a rural area and share a yard with the downstairs tenants. One of the downstairs neighbors has a cat that has attacked my two cats on several occasions. Most of the attacks have been witnessed by either myself or partner and every time my cats try to run inside while her cat chases them. The first few attacks only resulted in minor scratches. However, on one occasion I had to take one of my cats to the vet because she had a severe bite on her back leg; the bill came to $600. I initially thought the injury wasn't that severe, and Downstairs Neighbor offered to pay the vet bill, if needed. Once she discovered we did have to go to the vet, she backtracked and said she shouldn't have to pay. After sitting down and having a conversation, we agreed to split the cost of the bill, with the guarantee that her cat wouldn't be allowed outside anymore so as to prevent further skirmishes.

In addition to the aggression and violence, her cat has entered my unit twice through the patio door which I sometimes leave open for fresh air (I have a separate patio), has sprayed pee on the patio screen door, has regularly vomited on my patio furniture (yes, I'm positive it wasn't my cats since the vomit was left overnight and my cats are never outside at night), and has also scratched and climbed up my other screen doors while taunting my cats on the other side.

Although we agreed the downstairs cat wouldn't go outside anymore, that lasted maybe a month or two and then the cat was regularly outside again. I texted my neighbor about the continued problems (there was another attack on my cat that resulted in a bleeding scratch on her nose), but she never responded (she was subleasing her room for several months, but her cat stayed behind). I asked our property manager for advice, and he emailed all tenants saying all cats must remain indoors, and failure to do so will result in immediate termination of lease for the offending tenants. Since then, in 6 weeks the cat has been outside at least three times. I realize stuff happens and I gave them a couple of passes to get into a new routine of inside only, but after the third time I suggested to my neighbor it's time for her cat to find a new home. Of course she refuses, and I greatly sympathize as an avid cat lover. But I'm also sick of having to deal with the consequences of her aggressive cat, especially since she won't accept financial responsibility. And my cats would love to go back outside themselves.

I don't want to tattle to the property manager and get everyone downstairs kicked out, since it's only one of the housemates' cat, so I suggested to the cat's owner that it's time for the cat to find a new place to live. Since she refused, I told her she has three options: 1) re-home the cat 2) move out herself with the cat 3) I tell the property manager and everyone gets kicked out.

However, on one occasion I had to take one of my cats to the vet because she had a severe bite on her back leg; the bill came to $600. I initially thought the injury wasn't that severe, and Downstairs Neighbor offered to pay the vet bill, if needed. Once she discovered we did have to go to the vet, she backtracked and said she shouldn't have to pay. After sitting down and having a conversation, we agreed to split the cost of the bill, with the guarantee that her cat wouldn't be allowed outside anymore so as to prevent further skirmishes.

In addition to the aggression and violence, her cat has entered my unit twice through the patio door which I sometimes leave open for fresh air (I have a separate patio), has sprayed pee on the patio screen door, has regularly vomited on my patio furniture (yes, I'm positive it wasn't my cats since the vomit was left overnight and my cats are never outside at night), and has also scratched and climbed up my other screen doors while taunting my cats on the other side.

Although we agreed the downstairs cat wouldn't go outside anymore, that lasted maybe a month or two and then the cat was regularly outside again. I texted my neighbor about the continued problems (there was another attack on my cat that resulted in a bleeding scratch on her nose), but she never responded (she was subleasing her room for several months, but her cat stayed behind). I asked our property manager for advice, and he emailed all tenants saying all cats must remain indoors, and failure to do so will result in immediate termination of lease for the offending tenants. Since then, in 6 weeks the cat has been outside at least three times. I realize stuff happens and I gave them a couple of passes to get into a new routine of inside only, but after the third time I suggested to my neighbor it's time for her cat to find a new home. Of course she refuses, and I greatly sympathize as an avid cat lover. But I'm also sick of having to deal with the consequences of her aggressive cat, especially since she won't accept financial responsibility. And my cats would love to go back outside themselves.

I don't want to tattle to the property manager and get everyone downstairs kicked out, since it's only one of the housemates' cat, so I suggested to the cat's owner that it's time for the cat to find a new place to live. Since she refused, I told her she has three options: 1) re-home the cat 2) move out herself with the cat 3) I tell the property manager and everyone gets kicked out.

47,1cxiu5n,AITA for not hanging out with my GF if she's been drinking?,"So we have lived together for 2 years. I love hanging out together when we're sober, and to some extent when we're both drinking.  (She gets exponentially more ""difficult"", you could say, for each drink. But that's beside the point.)

Admittedly, this is not happening often. She has this habit of taking ""a few"" (2-10) beers while she's out and about, and not mentioning it before I ask when I inevitably notice something is off. Now, I of course don't mind her coming back to her own home drunk, but she is fully expecting me to be social and hang out while I'm entirely sober. I'm sure you can relate to being the only one who's sober, it's kind of awkward and not very engaging.

At some point I got tired of her coming home with varying degrees of intoxication, so now I tell her I don't want anything to do with her if she's had more than 2 beers on her lonesome. I'll just do my own thing and mostly avoid talking. I also tell her she's better off staying where she is rather than coming home if that is the case.

She gets really sad when I react this way, (and last time mad because she's ""only had 4"" and thought she was sober enough), and it breaks my heart to just ruin the rest of her day when she's in a good mood. She feels punished for breaking out of her shell and finally being social. But I don't know if I'm being unreasonable or manipulative. I made my boundaries clear, and I don't know how else to deal with it while still respecting her freedom.

It seems initial consensus is unanimously NTA. I feel it might be a bit more nuanced, but In the interest of keeping OP short and concise, I left out some details;

Yes, she is aware it's a problem to not be able to be social without drinking. And it has been much, much worse  (and not necessarily just EtOH) before she met me. She is getting help, and is getting better.

48,1cxin1q,AITA for inviting someone my close friend dislikes to an event? ,"So here’s the situation. My close friend dislikes Linda because they are both seeing the same man. Linda, however, is completely unaware of this, while my close friend knows everything. 

*Please don’t ask me why; I’ve tried to convince my close friend to leave this man, but she refuses to listen.*

Before any of this drama, Linda and I were just social media acquaintances. We moved in the same social circles and had many mutual friends. Our interactions were casual, consisting mostly of likes and comments on each other’s posts.

Recently, during one of our meetups, my close friend gifted me a book she thought I’d love. Excited and eager to dive into a new read, I posted on social media, ""might just start a book club."" The response was overwhelming. Several friends expressed interest, including Linda, who was particularly enthusiastic and eager to help. Despite my initial reluctance, I entertained Linda's ideas. She even offered to contribute goodies if we decided to have goody bags, which seemed like a fun addition. She was proper sweet.

Later that day, I talked to my close friend about the book club idea. I expected her to be excited, but instead, she was furious. She reminded me that we had discussed starting a book club together last year, but I wasn’t interested at that time. Now, seeing me plan it with Linda hurt her deeply.

Feeling terrible, I apologised and offered to cancel the whole thing to avoid making her uncomfortable. However, I didn’t want to exclude Linda outright, as it could cause major issues in our shared community and among our overlapping friends. After some thought, my close friend decided she wanted to be one of the founders but laid down two conditions: 1) I must not get close to Linda, and 2) I should only organise the club with her. Desperate to make amends, I agreed.

With that, my close friend threw herself into the project with enthusiasm. She made everything official, bought items for the goody bags, and even contacted companies for support. It seemed like things were finally falling into place.

But then, today I left a comment... Scrolling through social media, I saw a post from Linda wearing this stunning outfit. Without thinking, I left an innocent  comment. My close friend saw this and was upset. She sent me messages expressing her frustration:

“I literally gifted you that book and spoke to you about how uncomfortable she made me feel. Yet, you’re starting the book club and inviting her without discussing it with me first.”

&

“I’m not telling you not to be friends with her—that’s your own choice. But if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t engage with someone who made my close friend uncomfortable. At all.”

I apologised to my close friend again and reassured her that my loyalties lie with her. I explained that I was just being friendly and didn’t mean to cause any hurt.

Now, my close friend has backed out of everything, leaving me to handle the book club alone. I’m stuck in a difficult position. I don’t know what to do—maybe I was the one in the wrong after all.

49,1cxijkc,AITA for eating junk food infront of BF who's on a diet?,"AITA; My (27f) boyfriend (29m) recently found out he is at a high risk for diabetes and he is overweight on the BMI scale. His doctor told him he needs to start making changes to his diet. 

My boyfriend has always been a naturally bigger guy but recently he's been eating more unhealthy, thus has gained 15 more pounds since the beginning of this year. Since his Drs appt he's been trying to make more healthier meals at home instead of eating out, and he's going to gym more often. I have been trying to be as supportive as I can for him and if I'm not able to go to the gym with him, I'll ask if he wants to go jogging together or ride bikes.

Now I am the opposite of my bf. I have always been very slim and have trouble gaining weight. I've just always had a really fast metabolism. My diet isn't great, but I do eat at home (especially more now since he's been cooking and I eat his meals with him/or I make us both meals) but the problem is I snack a lot. 

I might have some ice cream at night after dinner or a cookie or two. 

My boyfriend has been making comments to me saying I need to stop the snacking in front of him because its not helping his diet. He becomes tempted when he sees me eating junk food and wants to join in. 

For example, a few nights ago after I got done from work, I decided to stop at dairy queen and I got a small sundae. My boyfriend ended up getting home earlier than expected so I walked in the house holding my sundae and he got upset. He said ""oh my god... did you really need to get that? You don't need to have a treat every night, you can go one day without it. This is just ridiculous."" 

Also, I bought some Hershey chocolates at the store the other day and put them in the pantry. When he was in the pantry getting stuff to make dinner with, he saw the chocolates and got mad. He told me I shouldn't be buying this stuff and starts lecturing me on how bad it is.

Every time he sees me with junk food, he makes several comments about how I need to be more healthier, how I don't need to eat everytime I feel hungry, one day this will all catch up to me and then I'll regret eating this stuff. He also says I'm inconsiderate for eating it in front of him when he's clearly trying to he healthier. 

I do want to support him and I feel like I have been but I told him I don't think it's fair he controls what I should and shouldn't eat. 

Idk, I do feel bad but at the same time, I'm getting annoyed when he makes comments to me every time I want to enjoy something. 

AITA for this?? What can I do to be more supportive?

51,1cxhs24,AITA for leaving for a couple days due to so many bugs in our house?,"We’re talking seasonal bugs like ants, pincher bugs, and spiders. They’re everywhere. No matter how often I clean up, they just find new places to appear. I found a highway of ants in my closet and I just can’t take it anymore. I cleaned everything out and I have no idea what they’re going for. I bought pesticides from Home Depot a couple weeks ago and my partner finally sprayed around the perimeter of the house last week. Still tons of bugs, so he sprayed again. There are less, but still so many. 


I have a newborn and a toddler and I’m struggling to keep up with their usual schedule because I’m constantly sweeping up ants, killing pincher bugs (blehck), moving spiders outside, etc. I’ve been spraying them with a water/dish soap mix, but that only helps for a little bit. 


When I was 13 years old, an ant got in my ear and it was a bit traumatic. I could hear it walking around and I couldn’t get him out. Grossest feeling. I put my head under a faucet and ran water in my ear until the noise stopped. Gave myself an ear infection. Now I’m afraid of it happening to me again, or worse, happening to one of my kids. I’ve asked my partner if we can contact a pest control company, but he refuses. I asked him to spray again last night and he said, “are you serious?” I then asked if he could spray in the morning, and he ignored me.

So I’ve had enough. I want to go stay with my parents for a couple days and hopefully my partner will do something about the bugs while we’re gone.

Maybe I need to just do it. I just don’t want to accidentally subject the baby to poison.

For the past 4-5 years I have taken the kids on a fun summer road trip. The three of us plan a destination and pick things we want to see on the way there and back. It's been a great bonding experience for us and a lot of fun. Last year I let each kid bring one friend along on the trip and am doing the same thing this year. We are planning on leaving for the trip next weekend.

My son is an outgoing, gregarious kid who is involved in multiple sports and has a long list of close friends. My daughter, on the other hand, is very much an introvert and only has a few friends that I know of. The friend she brought with last year is definitely her closest friend. She was planning on bringing the same girl with on our trip this year.

Unfortunately, my daughter's friend had a fall a couple weeks ago while riding her bike and broke her leg & collarbone. Obviously, she would be very uncomfortable sitting in a car for long periods and there are stops on our trip where she would be unable to participate in the activities we want to do. There are also a couple places we planned on camping that I just don't think will work for her. My daughter says her friend still wants to come with and her parents are OK with it but I don't think it's a good idea.

I suggested to my daughter that she invite a different friend but she says she doesn't have anyone else she wants to ask. I might have messed up but I went behind her back and talked with her friend's parents about it. I expressed my concerns about their daughter coming on the trip and I guess the two girls did not give them a complete rundown of the activities we have planned. After our conversation, they agreed that it would probably be best if their daughter stayed home.

As you can imagine, my daughter did not take this news well. She is very angry with me and thinks I sabotaged her friend coming with on purpose. She has been begging me to cancel/change some of our plans so that her friend can still come with. I told her that both me and her friend's parents agree that her friend coming with isn't a good idea, so this isn't just my decision.

She is saying she won't come on the trip at all if her friend can't come. I do feel bad about the whole thing, but at this point I don't think there's much else I could do to make this work. I mean, yes, I could alter plans to make things easier for her friend, but with how limited her mobility is going to be that probably wouldn't be much fun for everyone else.

My ex thinks I should do whatever it takes to get my daughter back on board so that she isn't excluded. But that just isn't realistic.

53,1cxh6ao,AITA for wanting a AC break despite my husband's allergies?,"My husband (40M) has allergies, bad to where his nose gets clogged and he gets migraines. For being an outdoorsy guy, he is pretty much allergic to everything outside. He is supposed to be on a daily regiment of the netty pot, nasal spray and migraine medicine. All of which he does not do unless the migraine is already in full swing. He also turns into an pleasant jerk when he gets hot. He doesn't have great skills managing his temper, he gets short and frustrated quickly when he gets too warm. Yes, I know it sounds very immature but its very true. So needless to say, he loves AC. I am not a fan, unless it's 85 + degrees out.

He has to have it on when it's 55 outside!  He keeps the house at 60-64 degrees. I am FREEZING. I don't want to put on a sweat shirt and pants inside, and then strip down to my shorts and tank top to go out and work on our farm. I know selfish. I love fresh air, and a breeze. I have tried compromising with a fan but he says it circulates dust and dog hair which defeats the purpose. I've tried cleaning better, but animal dander and dust is hard to stay on top of when we both work 65+ hours a week. I bundle up when I go to bed because its so cold, than he complains that I am too warm with too many layers to cuddle. 

I don't know how to win. I have asked him to not keep the house so cold in the summer time. I have crappy circulation in my hands to where the tips of my fingers start to sting if they get too cold. He jokes that my feet and hands are freezing. Last time I got mad and said, ""Well if you gave me a break from the stupid ac, my hands wouldn't be so cold all the time."" As a result, this turned into me not caring about his allergies or his well being. I have asked him to go back to the doctor and see if they can come up with something more manageable as treatment because he says he has no time for the regiment of meds already prescribed.

54,1cxh09x,AITA for walking out of a gathering of friends after I felt disrespected.,"Over the weekend, I went to my friend's new place. He's my best friend and we were neighbours for over 15 years. So I am already not too thrilled about it but I get it. It's completely fine. 

The new place is a mess of boxes and all. My mate, let's call him Nate, knows that I'm not very handy in working with my hands. Pun intended. I can't bolt a screw or hammer a nail or drill a wall. I actually dislike all of that. A childhood thing. So he never asked me for my help. I'm more of a letters guy. I help him out with buearucratic stuff, permits, emails, computer stuff. That is my area and he gets it. We're totally cool about that.

A couple of our friends show up who are exactly what you need to hang the posters and assemble a shelf. Handy guys. One of them, Moe, as soon as he walks in and I haven't seen him in a long time. (Though, I recently helped him with some writing stuff up and such and he was very happy with the results) and starts berating me. ""You've gotten fat, you're getting dumb"" that kind of banter. I never appreciated it but sometimes I laugh it off if it is done in good spirit. 

Now, I visited my friend early morning after I finished my graveyard shift so I'm pretty knackered and Nate knows that I can fall asleep on his couch at any given moment. That's completely fine. 

So while Moe is cranking up the measuring tape and pencils and such, I'm falling asleep. I figure it is time to get back home. But he keeps piling on. ""You're a useless bum, you can't even drill a hole in the wall"" and other stuff like that. 

It felt different from previous times. It felt disrespectful. Nate and the other guy are just laughing it away. I grabbed my keys and headed to the door. Moe rushes to me arguing that I shouldn't go, he was joking. It was just banter. 

But I didn't want to engage him anymore. I told him it's fine. I just need to get home and sleep it off. He grabbed my arm to stop me from leaving. Nate came out and asked me to stay a bit. But I wasn't having any of it. I really dislike this childish locker room crap. I never engage in it. I ended relationships and friendships before over such things. 

I asked Nate to lock the door behind me and I left. Nate and I have nothing between us. We're best mates. We talk everyday. But Moe didn't get back to me even though he showed a bit of remorse towards the end. Maybe his ego won't let him. But as far as I'm concerned, let bygones be bygones but I don't want to hear that crap again. Our friendship depends on it. It also made me relectunt to visit Nate in the coming future. It felt like such a negative environment to be in. It felt emasculating if I'm frank. Oh, and we are all in our late thirties. So I figured I didn't need to hear that crap in my age.

","Throwaway account to protect my privacy because I have a few friends who follow my Reddit. As some background, this happened quite a few months ago, but it's still brought up today so wanted some opinions.

This is quite a unique situation which I cannot believe I have got myself into, but there you go. I won't bore everyone with a long background, but my (M47) ex-wife (F44) and I have one daughter, Nicole (F17). We divorced when Nicole was 9. We're effective at co-parenting, and I believe we've brought Nicole up to be a smart, grounded, and mature individual.

I met my current wife, Annabel (F45), five years ago. I was introduced to her through a colleague and we hit it off. Annabel has a daughter, Leah (F17), from a previous relationship. Leah and I got off to a rocky start, which I understood as she was a 12/13-year-old girl adjusting to a new family dynamic, but we now have quite a strong relationship, and I do love her.

Unsurprisingly, Leah and Nicole have always butted heads. I didn't expect them to be ""sisters"" or anything because this isn't a fairytale but they're very competitive with each other. They're both competitive and driven and as they have a lot in common, there's always been a game of oneupmanship.

A few months back, it was time to apply for colleges for them both. I visited a few colleges with Nicole and one with Leah, and helped them both with writing applications. Of all the colleges they visited, they (annoyingly) both had the same college as their favorite. 

Long story short, Leah ended up getting in and Nicole didn't. Nicole was really upset but I tried to tell her how the other colleges she did get a place for were still great. I didn't figure there was any benefit to telling her Leah got in but my wife, Leah, her grandparents, uncle, aunt, and I went for a meal to celebrate the achievement. Of course, my wife put a photo of it up on Facebook saying how ""proud she was of Leah getting into X college"".

Nicole saw this and went crazy telling me how I'd favored my ""bitchy stepdaughter"" over her, I didn't care about her, how could I celebrate her achievement when my actual daughter didn't get in. My ex also gave me an earful on the phone saying how inconsiderate it was to Nicole and I should be favoring my own daughter. 

The whole thing has caused increased resentment between Nicole and Leah, and Nicole still mentions it and how annoyed she is by the situation. I feel there was nothing wrong by celebrating Leah's achievement because I love her and I was proud, but maybe I shouldn't have when I know Nicole didn't get in?

57,1cxgvp2,AITA for feeling offended by my friends actions?,"In university I (F20) became best friends with my roommate Eliza (F20). She was extroverted compared to me and helped me come out of my shell. She also convinced me to visit her home country and hang out with her close friends there. I eventually started dating one of her friends and I learned that she tried sexting one of her best friends' exes in the past and never told her.

This friend Alex and her boyfriend Jean got together again and Alex learned about my friend Eliza’s incident however never confronted her hoping Eliza would come out clean herself, which she didn't. When Eliza accused Alex of being distant however hell broke loose and the truth was revealed subsequently ending the friendship.

This incident scared Eliza to the point of asking me to talk with my boyfriend about their friendship because she thought they might grow distant too. She has also always compared me to his ex at anything and accused his ex (and basically me) of growing herself and him distant.  Around this time she also accused him of forcing his girlfriends to take birth control, implying we didn't care about STDs or accidental pregnancies. These were all conversations I held with her while she knew we were dating.

I did put up with these comments, sometimes even felt responsible and paid no mind to the incident she had with Alex and Jean. This all changed however when I was planning a not-so-surprise party for my boyfriend and made the mistake of asking for her help. She took it upon herself to invite people and plan the entire party herself even though she thought he had no friends. I also invited Alex and told Eliza beforehand to make sure she didn't freak out, to which she replied with “if she's fine im fine”. Alex had also asked me if she could bring her boyfriend Jean and I said yes; there were two other couples at the party so it was only fair. Upon learning of this Eliza freaked out and dissociated during the entire birthday which made me feel responsible at the time.

We ended up having a big fight over everything that happened, even addressing some past problems. She did apologize in the end but also said ""Im sorry you felt that way"" and ultimately I was very offended by her actions. This gave me the opportunity to get to know Alex a bit more and confide in her, but a part of me can’t help but feel guilty about the way things happened with Eliza.

58,1cxdbje,WIBTA: Am I selfish? BFF wedding or SIL wedding in Europe (All expenses covered),"Hi, 

Disclaimer: (long post sorry, please help) - english is not my 1st language.

This is my first post so I hope it reaches someone, my (28) bf (29) encouraged me to ask other people, as the title says: one of my best/closest friends (27) of 10 years gets married in our city the same day as my boyfriend's sister gets married in Paris (I live in Mexico and have never been to Europe). He is inviting me to the wedding and will pay for my flights and trip, which will last 2 weeks total.

I sort of already decided to stay for my bestfriend's wedding, but I can't help but wonder if she would have done the same thing. I love her and she has stated that she would ""kill me"" if I missed her wedding. I think it's unfair because I have always been a TRUE friend to her, whom she can always count on, but I also get were she is coming from. At the same time I see this trip as an opportunity that I have never had before and it honestly excites me a lot. 

A lot of my friends say that I should stay for the wedding and a few of them say that I should go on the trip, my parents say that my bf might be my future family and comes first (but I don't think they value friendship as much as I do) **I am trying to be a good friend but I don't know if she is being selfish or if I'm being selfish.** She thanked me for deciding to stay and said that I can go to Paris on another occasion, which I guess it's true, and she will only get married once, but it still bugs me to think that if the tables turned I would have told her that as much as I want her to be on my wedding I understand if she wants to go on the trip. 

The real problem is that if I miss her wedding she will stop being my friend.

Important points:

\- My bf and I have been dating for 3 months (we are grown so I know this is for real and he has made his intentions on wanting to marry me clear from day 1) by the time of the trip we will be dating for 8 months. 

\- I don't know my sister in law because she lives in Paris, she is my Bf's twin and he will be walking her down the aisle.

\-My friend and I have been bffs for 10 years and I know for a fact she will not take it lightly that I miss her wedding.

\-All of my bf's siblings will be taking their partners.

\-My bf respects my choice and understands if I choose to stay.

I dont' know if I am missing anything.

tldr: is it worth it to jeopardize my bff's frienship to go to my sister's in law wedding in paris (all expenses covered by my bf), who is being selfish or none of us are?

I love her and she has stated that she would ""kill me"" if I missed her wedding. I think it's unfair because I have always been a TRUE friend to her, whom she can always count on, but I also get were she is coming from. At the same time I see this trip as an opportunity that I have never had before and it honestly excites me a lot. 

A lot of my friends say that I should stay for the wedding and a few of them say that I should go on the trip, my parents say that my bf might be my future family and comes first (but I don't think they value friendship as much as I do) **I am trying to be a good friend but I don't know if she is being selfish or if I'm being selfish.** She thanked me for deciding to stay and said that I can go to Paris on another occasion, which I guess it's true, and she will only get married once, but it still bugs me to think that if the tables turned I would have told her that as much as I want her to be on my wedding I understand if she wants to go on the trip. 

The real problem is that if I miss her wedding she will stop being my friend.

Important points:

\- My bf and I have been dating for 3 months (we are grown so I know this is for real and he has made his intentions on wanting to marry me clear from day 1) by the time of the trip we will be dating for 8 months. 

\- I don't know my sister in law because she lives in Paris, she is my Bf's twin and he will be walking her down the aisle.

\-My friend and I have been bffs for 10 years and I know for a fact she will not take it lightly that I miss her wedding.

\-All of my bf's siblings will be taking their partners.

\-My bf respects my choice and understands if I choose to stay.

I dont' know if I am missing anything.

tldr: is it worth it to jeopardize my bff's frienship to go to my sister's in law wedding in paris (all expenses covered by my bf), who is being selfish or none of us are?

59,1cxd9wi,AITA for Taking Back the Car I Bought for My Mom and Brother?,"
I’m Lacy, a 20-year-old serving in the military. I received a kick-off bonus of 18k, and things were going well until my mom, Janet (40), asked me to help my brother Jack (17) get a new car. I agreed to pay for an $8k car under the condition they pay me back monthly. Six months later, they've only made one payment of $1,800 from selling Jack's old car. Despite promises, they've been spending money on casinos, kayaking, and partying. When I confronted them, they gaslighted me and started blaming me for picking the car. I plan on taking them to court as the car is in my mom's name, although I have proof of payment and their agreement to pay me back. 

Our relationship is strained; my mom favored my siblings, kicked me out, and discouraged my dreams like college. She’s only became kinder when she found out about my money. They never visited me during my time in Pensacola, and my mom now wants me to buy her a house. My boyfriend and friends made me realize I was being used. Am I wrong for wanting to reclaim the car?

Any advice on what I should do ?? 

Edit : the car in my mom name (she lied saying it couldn’t be in my name cause it would mess up her insurance) , i will not be buying her no house either . i can’t file a small court case since it will interfere with school and they aren’t going to prove my leave for this .  i will be cutting them off after this ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for Taking Back the Car I Bought for My Mom and Brother?

60,1cxd09w,AITA for talking to both my mother & sister?,"I, 19, F live in India with my mother & sister. It's pretty much common to live with your parents in India, and especially for girls. My sister is 21. My parents had an arranged marriage, and since forever they've been fighting. He left us in December, 2021 (or I can honestly say that my mother asked him to go). We're a middle class family. Now when my father lived with us, my mother and him always used to have arguments, and my mother always brought that to us, told us everything since a very young age. My father was wrong in a lot of ways, but it wasn't as if my mother was a saint (from usually taunting him, to acting weird). When it all ended, it was because we were out of town, father was at home, he used to usually text us (I didn't have a phone, on mom's phone only) but my mother insisted on not replying. She didn't tell him when we were to return, and we returned very late, he slept at home, didn't open door, we were outside for 2-3 hours, scene created by mother. Now that he isn't there, my mother and sister fight very frequently. My sister wants to be on social media, and have a boyfriend (which all she has done hiddenly) now my mother gets mad at her for this (fights ranging from you're not my daughter, it's all your father's blood to go away, and beating her), and this happens every fu\*\*\*\*g year. My sister has history of lying, deceit, stealing, once she bought a phone without telling or asking, she wasn't earning, she said she got that by saving money on travelling which my mother gave, now she lost a gold earring, which my mother says she must've sold. In all this everytime a fight happens, they drag me in the middle. I pretty much don't have any friends, no social life, and don't argue much with my mother. It's like she also says this, she also does this, and on very petty things I get scolded, my studies are also highly affected by all this, as my mother expects me to find things about my sister, talk and convince her. Once my sister's phone was picked by my mother, and sister refused to put the password in, I saw the phone in morning, and by some tech skills understood it has a dating app, I deleted that before giving phone to mom, and warned my sister regarding it, now on another app my sister wrote that I saved her, mom asked me, I said she's lying.

61,1cxcvzv,AITA for refusing to pay “my fair share” of drinks when I don’t drink? ,"We had a bachelorette at Vegas last weekend and hit up a steakhouse and drinks at the club. The shows we visited were all on our own cards and so was the steakhouse but my friend put her card down for buying drinks and appetizers at the club. I don’t drink, I haven’t drank since college (I’m 32 now) and all my friends know this. 

I had a custom mocktail which cost $20-25 and a sparkling water. We agreed beforehand to split the bill but I took that to mean food (we had appetizers) and not that I would be required to pay for drinks. The other girls did order 2 champagne bottles along with cocktails. 

Then we got back home and I got a Venmo request for $470 which I was shocked by. I called my friend to ask what the breakdown was and they said it was split. I said it was quite a bit as I remembered we ordered 4 appetizers that were $30-40 each so my share of that shouldn’t be that high. She got annoyed and told me we agreed to split the bill and I said I did but only for the appetizer. She said she didn’t take photos of the bill and now has no idea what anyone ordered so I should agree to pay my share. I said I didn’t drink so the only thing that’s my share is the mocktail. She said everyone was pretty wasted so it was hard to determine who drank what and since I didn’t keep track I should just pay for it. By my calculations I owe about $60-70 but since I didn’t keep the receipts she is insisting I pay the whole $470. 

I’m very unhappy with the situation and told another friend about this. She acknowledged I owe way less than what I’m being told to pay but said out of the girls I clearly had the best job and 2 of the friends were living with their parents and working nearing min wage I should just pay and call it even. I’m feeling like I got fleeced because my flights and hotels weren’t even as expensive as this one night out.

Edit: thanks for your advice. I got the bill and I owe $81 including tip. The bill is $470 split 5 ways but the 2 bottles are over $500 each which is insane. 
We didn’t agree to split the bride’s share but I texted the bride to let her know I’ve covered my share of her portion. I sent $240 to the girl and sent her the receipt that I got to prove that I paid my portion and 1/4 of the bride’s. She hasn’t responded so I hope that is that.

I (28F) have a friend (23F) we have been friends for at least 4 years now. She has helped me at my lowerest and I have helped her though hers. We have spend nights crying and thinking no one would love us and we will be all we have. Which we agreed is the greatest. She than ended up getting back with her ex , who of course I never thought actually deserves her. But I supported her all the way with smiles, it's her choice I just need to be there for her. She ended up becoming pregnant and I was moving  to another state. She wasn't happy about it as she said she would miss me alot but she was okay about it. It went on as normal and we were still best friends, her tummy grow and the baby boy was growing nicely. In that time I ended up meeting a great guy with a son and we got serious very quickly for the better. Again she wasn't really happy because it meant less time for her but she was happy I was happy. I took on the mommy role very quickly and the little boy didn't have a mom because she left my bf when the baby was 1 month old. I moved in with my bf and he proposed after a year of dating. After being engaged for about 3 months we found out we were pregnant too. Which we are so happy about. In this whole time we were still talking and being good friends and she also got engaged. Than all of a sudden she moved to the state I'm and lives a few miles away. That's when stuff started getting weird. I kept asking her when she has moving so I could help and come around to see her. She kept leaving me on read and not responding. I would then leave it because I don't want to overwhelm her. Than after 2 weeks she sends me a message and tells me off for not messaging her and she feels like I'm forgetting her. I then told her that's not the case, I have been busy and waiting for her to answer. To which she says but I just seem distancing to her. I promised I would try harder to contact her and try to see her. Then we spoke for a day properly again and I made she to answer her right away so she doesn't feel like I'm distancing her. again she left me on read and I kept sending messages to her , around 7 including voice notes. Which she never answered or listened to. And than randomly she message me saying she I never let her know how the baby is growing and she feels like my fiancé is taking me away from her. But my fiancé is excited to meet her and her fiance and baby. I then told her that and asked her how they are.I sent her a long message about the pregnant going. Then again she never answered again. So now my brother and fiancé are saying she is taking advantage of my nice and making me feel bad all the time when it's her that's not putting in effort.

So my question is WIBTA or AITA for not answering her or contacting her again after she has ghosted me yet again?

My fiance comes from a family that is very close to each other and their extended family. There are 11 kids between his siblings, cousins, and a friend that are all under the age of 10, and two older teenagers. Most of the kids are well behaved and act like normal kids, but there are a few that are not disciplined, throw tantrums often, and generally just don't listen. I told my fiance when we were first planning the wedding that I didn't want to have kids there, and even though he generally would of liked to have them, he agreed.

We sent out invitations that noted this would be a child-free wedding. Most of his cousins, friends, and one sibling have told us that they would not be able to come since they couldn't bring their kids. This is the majority of our wedding party and people we want attending since we planned to have a small wedding.

66,1cxc81y,AITA for boxing my concerns about a family member's relationship?,"For context, my (27F) cousin (29F), who I am very close to, had spent the last 3 months or so spending time with someone and I've been very excited for her. It's her first WLW relationship (we are both lesbians) and at first it seemed like it was going real well for the two of them. 
Her and this woman are both still living at home, and my cousin is still closeted. My cousin does not have a safe space at home but she is unable to move out due to the area she lives in being very expensive. I've been trying to get her to move to my area for two years since it would be easier on her but it has not happened. 
She meets this woman, things go well and she decides she wants to have a conversation about whether or not their exclusive, as she wants to be. The conversation happens and the partner tells her she isn't ready and needs to have her shit together. This talk somehow ends with my cousin also deciding she's not ready for a relationship. 
I warned her to not get into a situationship with this girl, it's going to hurt, and she's going to regret it. She brushes off my concerns with 'I won't I promise'
They had sex for the first time the recent weekend and I told her I didn't wanna hear any details but I was excited for her as she lost her virginity that night. 
I then told her I was worried that this relationship wasn't healthy for her, but never expressed not liking this girl.

",Asshole,2024-05-21,"AITA for boxing my concerns about a family member's relationship? For context, my (27F) cousin (29F), who I am very close to, had spent the last 3 months or so spending time with someone and I've been very excited for her. It's her first WLW relationship (we are both lesbians) and at first it seemed like it was going real well for the two of them. 
Her and this woman are both still living at home, and my cousin is still closeted. My cousin does not have a safe space at home but she is unable to move out due to the area she lives in being very expensive. I've been trying to get her to move to my area for two years since it would be easier on her but it has not happened. 
She meets this woman, things go well and she decides she wants to have a conversation about whether or not their exclusive, as she wants to be. The conversation happens and the partner tells her she isn't ready and needs to have her shit together. This talk somehow ends with my cousin also deciding she's not ready for a relationship. 
I warned her to not get into a situationship with this girl, it's going to hurt, and she's going to regret it. She brushes off my concerns with 'I won't I promise'
They had sex for the first time the recent weekend and I told her I didn't wanna hear any details but I was excited for her as she lost her virginity that night. 
I then told her I was worried that this relationship wasn't healthy for her, but never expressed not liking this girl.

67,1cxc57b,AITA for asking my partner to not call her female friend “bunny”?,"Hi so this is the first time I’ve ever posted here, and I apologize if there are any spelling errors I have dyslexia so I had a bit of a hard time writing. On to the story-
I(NB 20) saw a message on my partners phone (f 20) of her saying “good morning bun”. Me being on her phone isn’t anything new we swap phones all the time as we both share our passwords with each other. But I felt a bit uncomfortable with that message she had sent, so once she had gotten out of the shower I brought it up. 
I had asked who the friend was as I didn’t know their name, she told me it was an old childhood friend. Then I asked what “bun” meant and she said that it’s the friend’s nickname as in “bunny”. When I had told her that it’s weird to be calling a friend “bunny” she said that she’s been calling her it for a while and that it’s because she is a “little”(for those who don’t know it means she has age regression and feels comfort in regressing to a younger age) 
I had told her that I feel that knowing that information makes the nickname worse, i couldn’t fully explain why I felt it made it worse knowing that she was a little. I just know that those types of nicknames normally are something two people in a relationship share with each other, for example he has once called me “kitten” and one of my exes nickname for me was in fact “bunny” or “bun” 

So aita for not wanting her to call her friend “bunny”?

Edit: I’m sorry it took me a bit to add this edit, I was at work and didn’t get home until right now. But after the first couple comments of people letting me know that I was in the wrong I apologized to them, I understand that it’s just a nickname. I apologize for adding the extra info of my ex in the post I thought it was helpful, I understand now it was not. And for those who were confused on why I added the part on how the friend is a “little”, I had only added it because my partner told me it was the reason for calling them “bunny”. 
But again I have apologized to them way earlier in the day. ",Asshole,2024-05-21,"AITA for asking my partner to not call her female friend “bunny”?

Their parents divorced when they were really young and it was a messy situation, with their mom cheating, etc. My boyfriend lived with their mom and still does since he’s finishing his bachelor’s degree, while his sister lived with their dad until she turned 18. She started working full-time while studying at 19 to afford a nice place for herself. Now she’s finishing her master’s in technical physics and works as an engineer, so she makes a lot of money. She likes to spoil my boyfriend since according to her, she never received any help and wants him to life a not-so-stressful life. She talked to him about maybe picking up a 15-20hr job to help cover the bills (food etc.) but he is too stressed with his bachelor's degree so that's completely unreasonable for her to ask.

My boyfriend spends a lot of time at his sister’s place. He doesn’t sleep there but goes home around 10 PM every day, claiming he can concentrate better there. She even gave him his own workspace and upgraded her internet for both of them (that is so weird, he is not her child, who does that for their sibling). Since my parents don’t like my boyfriend because he’s not active in the church and we can’t afford to live together, we talk on the phone a lot during the day and evening. This was never an issue for his sister until recently when she started complaining that our calls were distracting her.
I politely told her that maybe she can work at the office more often (currently 3 days office, 2 days homeoffice) so we don't bother her as much. This didn't work for her since she has to do laundry, etc. during weekdays since she has to focus on writing her thesis on the weekends.
Then I suggested that since she earns a lot, she could help us afford an apartment. She agreed and found a place for about 1k a month, a 55 sqm 2-bedroom. At first, I thought she was joking, but she seemed excited for us. However, I told her it was too small for us because I need a room to paint since I’m an artist. She then said she couldn’t afford to help with a bigger place. Her excuse was that she doesn’t make enough to cover that.

I ended up calling her a controlling asshole and a horrible sister for trying to destroy our relationship.

75,1cxax6w,AITA For not Bringing my GF on vacation with me?,"I M (26) have been dating my current GF (F23) for about 2 years now in August. Her and I travel a lot together and we love to spend time together like that. Last year she came with me to Key West with my family and then her and I went to California and Kentucky a couple months after.

Recently I was given a promotion and part of that was about 10 months working at their headquarters and living in a hotel. From that a lot of family drama as unraveled. My Aunt has Stage 4 Multiple Myeloma and just recently I lost a Grandmother while the other has Dementia. All of this I have taken off work or spent weekends visiting or helping them in any capacity. One being taking my Aunt up home for holidays since I was an hr from her house. 

January into February my mom mentions over the phone that if my gf and I were interested in going on vacation to Mexico. It would be my parents plus another couples extended family (they would be about 8-10 approx). And I said no due to not being able to afford it. It’s at an all inclusive resort and I’m saving for an apartment plus expenses. A couple weeks later while my gf visits me and over the phone again my mom goes “I would like to take you and your brother and just have it a family vacation because of what has been going on”. Mind you my Aunts bf of 22 years broke up with her during her rounds of chemo and my parents drove 5 hrs round trip to see her. 

My GF of course was upset and I felt and still feel bad. I had a bad panic attack episode cause I was accepting my Aunt can die at any given moment prior to this call. My GF states “I understand it’s a family trip but I’m upset other people we know are going”. I commented “I understand but appreciate that myself and my family are going through a lot and we need a week just to ourselves. The past year we haven’t lived our lives because of family members health.”

There’s a couple my parents know and one I work for the same bank with. Her husbands family is attending.

Yes we need time apart sometimes but she’s going to Atlantic City with her mom for a week. I even offered and have paid for a hotel with points I earned from my previous stay. I also booked a long weekend (thank god for hotel points I racked up a million from Hilton) in AC for our 2 year.

One being taking my Aunt up home for holidays since I was an hr from her house. 

January into February my mom mentions over the phone that if my gf and I were interested in going on vacation to Mexico. It would be my parents plus another couples extended family (they would be about 8-10 approx). And I said no due to not being able to afford it. It’s at an all inclusive resort and I’m saving for an apartment plus expenses. A couple weeks later while my gf visits me and over the phone again my mom goes “I would like to take you and your brother and just have it a family vacation because of what has been going on”. Mind you my Aunts bf of 22 years broke up with her during her rounds of chemo and my parents drove 5 hrs round trip to see her. 

My GF of course was upset and I felt and still feel bad. I had a bad panic attack episode cause I was accepting my Aunt can die at any given moment prior to this call. My GF states “I understand it’s a family trip but I’m upset other people we know are going”. I commented “I understand but appreciate that myself and my family are going through a lot and we need a week just to ourselves. The past year we haven’t lived our lives because of family members health.”

There’s a couple my parents know and one I work for the same bank with. Her husbands family is attending.

Yes we need time apart sometimes but she’s going to Atlantic City with her mom for a week. I even offered and have paid for a hotel with points I earned from my previous stay. I also booked a long weekend (thank god for hotel points I racked up a million from Hilton) in AC for our 2 year. 

AITA for going, should have I not felt bad in that moment? I need guidance lol. ISTA for being upset? ",0.0,0.024978695437312126,0,1
76,1cxaqim,AITA for telling my mom to stop venting to me about her divorce?,"My mom filed for divorce from my step dad (who adopted me so legally he's my dad) almost 3 years ago because they just drifted apart. My dad also did some petty things to her in the marriage and prioritized hanging out with his guy friends to the point where he went on multiple guys trips per year without her leaving almost no time off to ever travel with her. She'd end up traveling alone or with her friends. I'm unsure if my mom was totally innocent in their drifting apart, but it's hard for me to judge because I've only heard her side. My dad won't speak on it to me.

Ffwd the divorce has been final for two years. My dad has gone little to no contact with her but she insists on them being friends. Some people from the friend group give my mom the cold shoulder and it really bothers her. According to her, my dad still does petty things to her to try to get at her, and has asked me to step in multiple times, and I reluctantly did. I really don't know who's in the wrong in these spats and don't care to know. I just want to be left out of it.

Now, years later, every time I talk to my mom she always slides in a dig at him, at who he's dating, or gossips about someone from the friend group who is cold to her.

77,1cxalac,AITA for going too hard in MMA?,"TLDR at the end.

Im an MMA/Kickboxing fighter. I have several fights coming up so I believe I'm needing to lock in and get paired with other people that go hard and are more experienced. Ontop of fight team training every other day, the days in-between are normal MMA classes with everyone else. I slow down and telegraph alot for the newer people, women, and in general anyone not on fight team. 

I've noticed that since locking in for these fights, I've accidentally gone a bit too hard on people. My friend fractured his leg from numerous reasons but one of then was from checking one of my kicks. I accidently round kicked a russian woman in the stomach when I didn't realize how close she was in the pocket and knocked the wind out of her.  I of course profusely apologize and tell myself to slow down but on the other hand, these are big fights and I don't want to treat training like a joke and slow down so much that these other people aren't learning anything. So what I've decided is to talk to my instructor and ask to not be paired with anyone that isn't able to defend/protect themselves.

I feel like that's demeaning and an asshole thing to say to the rest of the people, but I don't like hurting people and I especially don't like hurting friends when they're just trying to get better the same way I am. 

TDLR; I'm wanting to separate myself from some other classmates in MMA because I feel like they have lower levels of skill which will end up getting them hurt. I also feel like I'm going too hard without realizing it which reinforces my thoughts of separation. Should I nerf myself for half of my training days leading up to big fights or would it be better for everyone to just not fight these people?",Asshole,2024-05-21,"AITA for going too hard in MMA?

Then she goes ""okay, transfer me over to Susan"" which is her bff in the office, so they could talk.

I had answered, yes, I would go, and I thought my husband would go as well. My sister purchased before my husband was able to answer yes or no to going. My husband answered me after she had already purchased the tickets saying that he was not really interested in going. 

After she apparently purchased the tickets, she never mentioned it again, so I thought maybe she had changed her mind. Then she mentioned it a few days ago

84,1cx9nl1,AITA for telling my husband's kids how broke he was when we met after they insinuated I was a golddigger? ,"Ive 38F been married to my husband Rob 52M for 4 years now.  My husband's late wife died 1 year before we met and we dated for 2 years before marriage. He has 2 kids 28-Madison and 26-Brett. Note I am not calling them my stepkids because they explicitly told me I am not their stepmom, just their dad's wife. I didnt play a part in raising them so Im ok with that. Its always been a tense between us, Ive tried my best to be kind to them and have been generous when I can be, but they are very cold with me. Being a child of divorce, I can partially relate to a parent moving on so I try not to force anything. 

Madison recently got engaged and we are excited about it. Everyone was over recently and she asked about a wedding budget from us and Rob told her he was able to contribute 10k. She has bigger hopes for her wedding than this so she was upset and kept asking for more. Rob however is still working hard on building his savings back up. Before his late wife died, he basically wiped out his cash savings, had to cash out his 401k, and even took a small mortgage on his house to cover medical costs as well as life expenses since he had to cut back on working. Eventually he had to drop that job for a more flexible but lower paying one, so this 10k is actually really generous from him.

Rob went to run an errand and it was just me and his kids. Madison then asked me if Im going to give any in addition to what her dad is giving. I told her were a marital unit and thats what we discussed together as a reasonable amount to contribute. She then said ""I should have known, obviously you married an older man for what he had, not for what you could give"". I knew she didnt like me but this is the most flat out rude thing she ever said. I kinda lost it and said ""excuse me, who do you think has been paying the second mortgage your dad took out to pay his debts?"" 

Truth of the matter is I make more than her father by a large margin, I have no debt, and have been paying 70% of the household bills the whole time we've been married. The 10k were giving her, is available because Ive been able to subsidize her father's living expenses the last few years. I made it clear that not only am I not a golddigger, Im literally wealthier than my ""older husband"". She called me stuck up after this and stormed out. Then she called her dad later and said that I told her that I blamed her mother for being sick for her not having a better wedding budget.

Note I am not calling them my stepkids because they explicitly told me I am not their stepmom, just their dad's wife. I didnt play a part in raising them so Im ok with that. Its always been a tense between us, Ive tried my best to be kind to them and have been generous when I can be, but they are very cold with me. Being a child of divorce, I can partially relate to a parent moving on so I try not to force anything. 

Madison recently got engaged and we are excited about it. Everyone was over recently and she asked about a wedding budget from us and Rob told her he was able to contribute 10k. She has bigger hopes for her wedding than this so she was upset and kept asking for more. Rob however is still working hard on building his savings back up. Before his late wife died, he basically wiped out his cash savings, had to cash out his 401k, and even took a small mortgage on his house to cover medical costs as well as life expenses since he had to cut back on working. Eventually he had to drop that job for a more flexible but lower paying one, so this 10k is actually really generous from him.

Rob went to run an errand and it was just me and his kids. Madison then asked me if Im going to give any in addition to what her dad is giving. I told her were a marital unit and thats what we discussed together as a reasonable amount to contribute. She then said ""I should have known, obviously you married an older man for what he had, not for what you could give"". I knew she didnt like me but this is the most flat out rude thing she ever said. I kinda lost it and said ""excuse me, who do you think has been paying the second mortgage your dad took out to pay his debts?"" 

Truth of the matter is I make more than her father by a large margin, I have no debt, and have been paying 70% of the household bills the whole time we've been married. The 10k were giving her, is available because Ive been able to subsidize her father's living expenses the last few years. I made it clear that not only am I not a golddigger, Im literally wealthier than my ""older husband"". She called me stuck up after this and stormed out. Then she called her dad later and said that I told her that I blamed her mother for being sick for her not having a better wedding budget. I told him what happened and he was mad at her but also said I shouldnt have shared his financial details with his kids.",0.0,0.026862705126404762,0,1
85,1cx9mg3,AITA for drinking tea my spouse is allergic to?,"This is far from the first situation of this kind in my marriage, and I really need some perspective here. My spouse of a year and a half has A LOT of food allergies. The only one that is life threatening is citrus. As such, we try to keep our house as allergen free as possible, and if I want to be able to kiss them, I don’t eat anything they’re allergic to (which again is most things, it would take way too long to list). I have learned to cook so they can eat safely at home, I have removed many of my favorite foods and drinks from my diet, I have given up scented candles, perfume, and I have to use all the same skin and hair products as them, even if I don’t like them. 

For the past few weeks, there’s been a nasty virus going around our house and so we’ve both been pretty sick and miserable. I’ve had a sore throat and cough for five days. Before I met my spouse, I would have been drinking my favorite peach and orange tea and honey religiously to help sooth it. But my wife is allergic to honey, and most teas. The only tea we have that they’re not allergic to is one that I don’t like the taste of. 

So today I have to go to work and I have to be able to speak, so I made myself a thermos of the tea I like, taking care not to cross-contaminate anything, and I even put the lid on while it steeped, so that the vapors wouldn’t trigger their asthma. 

It wasn’t enough. When my spouse walked in, they said “is that poison tea?” And I replied that yes it was and they immediately left the room and said “Ah, so I’m staying away from you today, then. Enjoy your poison tea.” 

Their tone made me feel like shit. I just wanted the tea I love that I hardly ever get to drink to make me feel a little bit better while I worked. And just breathing in the vapor is not going to endanger their life. At most it will make them cough and have to take their inhaler. Am I the asshole?

ETA: Thanks for the replies. I admit I was an asshole here. I should have at least given my spouse a heads up before making the tea. It’s not up to me to decide when it’s okay for them to be exposed to an allergen. I do believe their allergies are real, I just think the levels they ask me to go to are a little over the top sometimes. Forgot to mention their only “real” allergy is citrus. Everything else causes Oral Allergy Syndrome, which will cause their mouth to feel itchy and make them cough, but will not send them into any kind of anaphylaxis. 

To answer some questions: yes, my spouse has an allergist they work with. They get allergy shots to help with all the allergies besides the citrus one (nothing to be done there). 

Yes, I knew about some of the allergies going into our marriage, but the amount of allergies and the steps we have to take to avoid triggering them have massively increased in the last year. When we got married, I could eat mostly what I wanted and kiss them without fear. The allergies have gotten so much worse. 

Yes, we have had many discussions and tried many different things to keep my spouse safe. It’s been a lot of trial and error. I’ve spent huge amounts of money on foods/products that I thought were safe, only to have them not be safe the next week when a new allergy pops up. I can’t keep buying new teas forever.

87,1cx95m6,AITA for treating my friend differently for befriending my enemy?,"I moved recently and began skating at a local skatepark. When I started going, I was befriended by someone there and became friends. Over the following year, the friendship soured because this person was always trashtalking other people at the park, competing with me on every little thing even unrelated to skating, and overall a very toxic person. He dragged me into numerous bad situations, one where he almost got into a fight and overall making me feel embarrassed for being around him. The range of topics he'd talk about was always the same - how much money his mom has, how he used to bully people, and other similar topics. Throughout the year, he barely even got to know me and knows nearly nothing about my background because he never asked. I got tired of this, I respectfully told him that we could not be friends anymore, that there are no hard feelings and that's that. He asked what he did, but I didn't respond because he was clearly aware of his poor behavior. This led to extreme trash talking on me to everyone in the park, telling people details about my background, and even a confrontation with me that almost ended in fisticuffs because I'm mostly a passive person and he kept trying to trashtalk me in person. Once I physically threatened him ( i didnt say id hit him but i walked assertively up to him, im 6,1 ) because he wouldn't stop, he never did again, but the trash talking became even more intense.

I made a friend over the past year which progressed into being closer friends throughout. We started hanging out and skateboarding together on the weekends here and there, mostly whenever we saw each other at the park type of thing. This progressed into going on a vacation together to skate and hang out with other friends in the past month. It's been a good friendship for the most part. He knows I used to be friends with the other guy, but had a falling out. He never asked any details or asked why which was fine. We improved a lot at skating together, going off of each other's vibes and people in the park started talking to us a lot. The other guy didn't like this at all and began putting serious effort into befriending my new friend whenever he could. My new friend, is reciprocating that effort in some ways. He does maintain our schedule of meeting up and prioritizes skating with me over him. He began skating on other days without telling me so he could hang out with the other guy.

I haven't stopped talking to him but I do see him a bit differently after this. It made me backtrack and wonder why he never asked about that guy and other behaviors that felt like he never wanted to talk in detail about what happened. Because I see him differently, it has definitely reflected in my behavior a bit. I feel a bit less engaged in our conversations and less motivated to meet up regularly lately. Nothing has changed (yet) but I think they will inevitably, hence I feel confused and detached.

88,1cx93th,AITA for saying no to my sister and her family staying with us after a house fire?,"My sister and her family lost their family home in a house fire three weeks ago. It happened in the middle of the night and initially stayed with our parents on night one. But our parents have a 1 bedroom house and space was not optimal for that. So they asked if they could stay with my wife and I and our kids. We said no. We said no for mostly one reason but kinda two.

For about 2.5/3 years now my sister has been so tough on my wife when it comes to what way she/we feed our kids. She focuses on my wife far more than me. But it does come back on me too. We don't keep sugar or junk food from our kids. We don't deprive them of that. We simply keep things balanced. We make veggie pancakes, we make healthier pizzas, we allow snacks like chocolate, ice cream or cake, we offer our kids sauces and not all of them are homemade but some are. My sister is so judgmental about it. She didn't let any of her kids have any kind of junk snack until they reached school and they can only eat something like chocolate at birthday parties and they limit the number of those they can attend in close proximity so they don't get two days of junk food in a week or more than three days of junk food a month. My sister or her husband will also stay at parties, even ones the 10 year old is invited to, to make sure they go for the salad over the pizza if they have the chips and candies.

My sister acts like our kids eating a chocolate treat or a few chips is the end of the world. She was especially horrified to find out we gave our kids fries with tacos one night and that another night we gave chicken bites with potato cakes and not plain chicken once the potato cakes were involved. Veggies were included both times but the idea of two less ""clean"" foods horrifies her. My SIL (wife's sister) is a pediatric dietician and she loves how we feed our kids. She told my sister that once. And my sister was horrified by my SILs profession.

This has all become such a problem that it has become my sister disrespecting my wife. So we see her far less. I don't like that. We used to be close. But I won't allow her to shit all over my wife over a difference in how we see things. Oh, and she also doesn't like that our kids get bread with soup.

For me, in low doses, they are tolerable, and sometimes even funny (but they are the joke).  When they would come to visit, they'd stay a week or more and act like our house was a B&B and they were on vacation.  One time I asked them to take our son to school because I had some meetings and my MIL actually said that they were on vacation not here to run our errands and besides, Cami should be taking him to school because she's the mom (they are big on trad wife roles).  The suposed point of their visits is to spend time with their grandson, but there was frankly little of that.  He'd come home from school and they'd say hi, but go back to watching NewsMax and the WWII channel.  After their last visit, I told my wife that the next time they should stay in a hotel.  I work from home and they have no boundaries or respect for others.

All fun and games when dealing with family, but recently, they finally went too far and my wife went no contact with them.  We were having a marital issue and she moved out for a few weeks.

I haven't told them that we've reconciled and my wife  is back home, but even if she was a hated ex, I would not let these fools use me to bypass her.

Cami and I have planned a family vacation and one of the recent emails from my inlaws stated that they intend to just show up uninvited.  As it turns out, it will be while we are gone.  They want to see their grandson and because they think we are still separated, stated that Cami wouldn't even have to know.  Do I break the NC and tell them that we won't be there?

I have a very large pokemon card collection. Which I've built on my own. My parents did not buy the cards for me. A while back I bought 2 Japanese pokemon card packs and I got a card worth \~$250 out of it. I packed it into a sleeve and toploader and everything and kept it safe.

  
One day I had been sorting out the cards in one of my binders on the dining room table, when my dad comes in and says he needed the dining room table and I had to go upstairs. (Mind you he was not cooking dinner or anything he just randomly came in there)

I explained to him that I'm currently sorting and I can't really move because one misplaced card in the binder would offset everything by 1 space.

My dad FLIPPED and grabbed my cards together and set them on the stairs (which lead upstairs and also to my room)

During that, my dad damaged my $250 card, so now its likely only worth about $100-$110 instead of $250. I was very upset (crying due to the damage he caused) and told my dad he owes me $140.

My dad has refused to pay me this money for MONTHS. He says its my fault, that I should not have been sorting on the dining room table. I reminded him and reminded him but he REFUSED to pay this money to me, so I went to my sister.

I told her my situation, and asked her that when she asks my dad for money next (We are middle class. Not rich, but my dad definitely has the money, we are not struggling by any means), to ask him for an extra $140 and give it to me.

91,1cx8tc6,AITA for telling my friend (23) that her (soon to be ex) husband and sister are assholes?,"Names changed for anonymity.
My friend Sara (now 23) got married early as she unexpectedly got pregnant at 19 and had her second child a year later.
During her first pregnancy, her then-fiance Tom (now 27ish?) cheated on her with her sister Molly (then 17).
She forgave him for whatever reason. I believe it was because she still had hopes for a better future, and believed that their marriage would turn things around. This went well until her second pregnancy, where, low and behold - Tom cheated on Sara *again* with Molly.
That's where Sara drew the line and settled for the unfortunate realization that she'd want a divorce. Unfortunately she's financially dependent on Tom, so she's still sharing an apartment with him and the kids.
She forgave both of them again. Don't ask me how. She broke contact with Molly a year ago, and now they're all even and friendly again.

Now hear me out, I'm a very timid person. I hate openly talking about my negative feelings and dislike towards people, because it never seems justified enough to me. This time however, I was absolutely exhausted.
While casually talking I kinda dropped the bomb that I dislike Tom and Molly and think they are assholes. The cherry on the shitcake that made me say that was when I found out that Sara has to sleep on the couch, so Tom and Molly can sleep in their former bed.
Just imagine your husband fucks your sister and then you have to take the couch because he needs to keep fucking her in your bed?!

That's where I was absolutely phasing out and bewildered at the sheer audacity.

Anyways, Sara didn't like that and told me it's her sister and her ex-husband, and she chose to forgive them. After that I just told her that I could never, but I'll support her not matter what.

I sat them down and he had no idea this was happening. I showed the many texts asking for me to babysit and he was under the impression that I have only babysat twice this month not 16 times.

I started to communicate in a group chat with them so everyone was on the same page. I only respond to her in the group chat and if she starts to spam me with texts about it I throw a screenshot in the group chat and have my son deal with it.

In short I explained that I am still working and I will not have that relationship. That I can’t have the kids every other day just like she had growing up. We agreed to every two week to have a grandma day.

So to add some context, my wife and I are well off and I've always quite enjoyed music and creating music. And while I'm not a major artist or anything, I do some performances here and there. To my joy, my son has shown some intrest and a good level of talent. It has even inspired me to try some different instruments. 

So my rule with my children is that I will not pay for anything past university and from there they have to fend for themselves. Only in special cases will I support them (like if one of them chose to become a pilot the 9/11 happens). So my middle has forever been pushing about no going to university and pursing something else. I didn't go to university so I had no problem with this but she's never been specific on what this something else is. But she's been asking that I give her the money I would've spent on her tuition so she can pursue something else. I was very against this but after a long time of her pleading, with big help from my wife and a decent plan of what she would be doing, I relented and let her be. She decided to move a few states over and try to make something of herself. 

So she just had a child and everyone was very happy for her. She's not yet married to the father but they are together and he is active in the child's life. However, recently she phoned my wife and I and asked if we would be willing to let them live with us for a few months. I was shocked because from what she has been telling us everything with her business had been going well.

I told my daughter I'd give her $5000 but that was it. My wife wasn't too happy with this. She told me that we should be caring for her in her time of need. She said that $5000 isn't nearly as much as I've spent on instruments for myself and my son and we have to be fair. I don't know what to make of this.

I am lucky enough to have a good job (French teacher in a private school), and a paid off house (parents’ life insurance and inheritance).

Before I had either of my kids, I made sure to have a year’s living expenses saved, then I would take a sabbatical to recover from birth, as well as bond with my kids. While on sabbatical, I still tutor some kids for some extra income.

99,1cx7e9r,AITA for not changing my son's schedule now that I have a stepdaughter?,"My husband of 4 years learned only a few months ago that he had a daughter he never knew about. The mother of his daughter was an ex he was with 8 years ago for a few months. She moved out of state and he never saw her again. She never mentioned being pregnant. But she was and her family had been taking care of my stepdaughter for almost 2 years because because my husband's ex had started doing drugs and drinking heavily so she was not fit to parent. They attempted to help her but when they realized it was a lost cause they decided to notify my husband.

A DNA test was carried out which confirmed he is the father of his daughter. She's 7.

It came as a surprise but wasn't something we struggled to accept. It was mostly strange because we were all strangers and my stepdaughter didn't know my husband or he didn't know her. So some time was taken to make sure they knew each other before she moved in with us. I'm also pregnant so a lot of changes have been going on. 

I have done my best to keep things as normal as possible for my 15 year old son. So nothing much has changed for him but this bothers my husband's parents. My son always spent a lot of time with friends and my ILs feel this is wrong now that he has a sister to get to know and a brother or sister on the way. They feel like I should be changing his schedule so he's home more and carve out plenty of time for them to bond because they hardly ever interact.

My husband said doing that could make him resent her when some things have already changed. He also pointed out that they won't have much in common given the age gap and the fact they're opposite sexes. My ILs said it's on me as my son's mom and only parent to make sure he gives my stepdaughter a real chance and gives her a chance to be a sister instead of a stepsister and by keeping his schedule as it is, I am not encouraging that. When I told them I didn't want to change bring even more changes to his life right now and wouldn't change anything they accused me of not caring about the consequences and not being a good mom or stepmom.

We came together with my brother and his fiancée after I had many of your replies to my husband and my sister. I stated clearly that I will support her in any way possible and that it’s very important for me to welcome home to the family properly but the jewelry is off the table because I believe I am fulfilling my mother’s wishes and I cannot hurt my daughters. 
I added that I believe that this is not the right way to join a family and that we should strive to resolve this conflict before it creates more tension between my daughters and their uncle and future aunt and also amongst us siblings. 
At first, I thought my brother really saw my point and he seemed happy that we offered to pitch together to buy something for his fiancée. Unfortunately she is not willing to accept this. as some of you pointed out, she seems to believe that she ranks right beside my sister and me when it comes to our late mother and supersedes my daughters.. well. She talked about her rightful place in the family and how she went no contact with her family because they denied her the respect that she deserves and that she will not hesitate to do the same with us. She also talked a lot about the pain of not being able to have any heirloom jewelry for her wedding. And honestly, I believe only a few days ago I would’ve given in presented with her tears but thanks to your kind words I was able to see through her emotional manipulation and really now that I am aware of what she’s doing it is so obvious.. I must say my brother looked very uncomfortable. She then stated that it would be a waste to give the pieces to my daughters since they would just sell them for the money to buy make-up wich is absurd. I ended the conversation at this point stating that I hold firm to my boundary and that they are free to do whatever they feel is the right thing for them.
I am heartbroken and I hope my brother will change his mind. So.. no happy ending but thanks again. 


Original Post:

This is my first reddit post, throwaway. Also Englisch is not my first language. 

My (53F) mother passed away 10 years ago and I inherited a few select items of jewellery from her. Those are things she cherished and wore often. I have been wearing her watch for the past 10 years, my sister (50F) holds a golden bracelet that she loves and there are three items left that me and my sister have been planning to give to my three daughters (20/18/18)  to commemorate 10 years since her passing. They always knew this and were close to their gradma. There is also no quarrel about who gets what. Enter my brother (48m) and his fiancée (38f) of two years. 
My brother is demanding one of the pieces for his future wife to wear. He claims we never involved him in any discussion as to what should happen to the pieces and we can’t just claim those to ourselves just because we are women. He says it’s very common for heirloom jewellery to be given to the daughter-in-law and he and his fiancée even cited Meghan Marke and Kate Middleton as examples. Legally there is no case to be made, my mother left those items to me. I have politly declined their request explaining that I can’t let one of my daughters go without and that they were very close to their grandma while his fiancée did not know her. His fiancée is apparently distraught and claims we don’t see her as family. My father wants me to keep the items and give one to my brother so that all of my mom’s kids eventually get one item and I can do as I see fit with the rest. My sister kindly has offered up her bracelet. I am torn. I don’t t want to antoganoize my brother and my sister-in law but I find my three daughters’ claim so much more valid. They have been looking forward to this for years. And I don’t want my sister to sacrifice her bracelet. If there were more pieces I would not hesitate to give something to her. It’s not a matter of money. 
I have offered other things out of my mom’s estate, they feel it’s not the same. I am also taking into account that my brother was married to his first wife 10 years ago and despite having been close to my mother she got no jewellery either but was left two of my mothers’s watercolor drawings. I feel like my mother left those pieces to me with the intention of eventually passing them on to her granddaughters. Would she have subscribed to the „each child or each daughter plus daughter-in-law has to get a piece of jewellery“ logic she would have left something to my brother or his then-wife in the first place. My daughters told me the would accept any decision I make but I feel it would be highly unfair to burden them with any involvement in the decision making. The choice is mine to make and I have to live with the consequences. According to my father they are debating to uninvite me from the wedding over this. I stand by my decision but It’s hard.. I was always on good terms with my brother and cordial with his fiancée.. so AITA?

103,1cx70vr,AITA for my attitude and kinda ignore the family of my husband?,"First sorry for my bad grammar. 

1,5 years ago I (f28) found out my tubes are fully blocked I can't get pregnant naturally. Yes there are stories it happens but my husband (27) and I already TTC for 3 years before I found out about my blocked tubes. So we started icsi last fall. It was really stressfull for me. But we handeld it very well together. We paid a lot money for it and still do.

In december last year the second egg was transferd and after 2 weeks I found out I was pregnant (the first transfer didn't stick). Only 1 week later I bleed and the doctor told me the embryo will not grow and gave me medicine to abort. After 2 weeks it was still there. I had to go to the hospital to get a curretage. I think I still haven't realize what happend to me, I just kept going. A lot woman having to go thru the same.

The younger brother (22) of my husband got his girlfriend (21) of 3 month ""accidentally"" pregnant. With ""accidentally"" I mean they didn't do anything to not get pregnant and ""just let it happens"". She never worked a day in her life wants everything brand new for the baby and smoked the whole pregancy. She delivered the baby in the beginning of this year. 

While I grief about my lost embryo the family of my husband celebrate the birth of my niece. It was so surreal. I blocked at this time everyone. My husband was a little bit overwhelmed with the situation. He was there for me and griefed for himself but on the other hand he was happy about the first baby in this family. I was not. I asked him not to speak about the baby. He did not speak about it. 

But after 2 month I met the baby and it was horror for me. I felt so sick and seeing my husband holding and talking to a new born was the worst. My husband saw how bad I felt at this situation but kinda ignore it ""to make it not more worse"" he said.

We had an argument after, my husband complained why he can't talk about the baby and why I act like that at the meeting. He felt like he could'nt be happy about the baby of this brother. I got so angry and made him claer that he can talk with everyone about this goddamn baby but not with me and that I don't want to meet this baby in the near future. It was just not good for me.

He understood my point and was kinda surprised that the misscariage still effect me so much. We talked about it  a lot and from than we never talked about the baby and his brother and girlfriend again. He's getting pictures of the baby but never show them to me. And I haven't meet them again.

But I'm getting the feeling that I need to start to calm down and stop pretending like the baby didn't excist for me/us. I will meet the baby again now or later. But I'm still very scared because of the next meeting with them and don't know how to get thru it again.

104,1cx6ygq,AITA for packing a carry on too heavy for me to lift? ,"I am 32 weeks pregnant and had to fly over the weekend. I had my carryon and was flying southwest. I’m not supposed to lift over 20 lbs but my roller bag was probably around 40. 

When boarding the plane I asked a flight attendant if I could have some assistance lifting my bag into the overhead bin and she said “of course! Just ask him (gestured to another FA further down the aisle) and he’ll help you) 

Approached that man and said “do you think you could help me put my bag in the overhead bin? It’s a little too heavy for me and I’m a little too pregnant” 

He says, “Help you? If it’s too heavy you should’ve checked it.” And walked away. 

I sat down and started sobbing (hormones.. I can’t take people being mean to me right now 😅) but later after I collected myself I googled it and got mixed answers. Some saying that if you can’t lift it you shouldn’t pack it and some saying that an FA’s job is to help. 

So, AITA? 

ETA: I’m in the US. I was also on a connecting flight so I didn’t want to risk losing my bag having checked it. I also booked “Business Select” (Southwest’s first class) on all of my Southwest flights to avoid not being able to choose my seat in an aisle due to having to pee every 5 mins or risking losing out on overhead bin space.

105,1cx6x6r,AITA for not forcing my son to lose on purpose with his cousin so she can have a win,"In my household when you play games we don’t allow other people to win by having other players go easy. The games are always fair. Also helped that when the kids were younger most games are just luck base.  Really not much strategy in playing Candy Land.

This is about my youngest he is 8. His cousin Beth is also 8.  My sister was over and and she  brought Beth. My son and her went to play some board games. Everything was fine until Beth started crying. She lost the game and this was the third one in the row she lost. Personally it was just bad luck since the games were luck based.


My sister went to calm her down and after asked me to tell my son to lose the next game. I told her no and brought up that Beth shouldn’t have a mini breakdown to losing a board game.

This started an argument, she called me a jerk for not “ controlling my competitor son” ( her words). I told my brother about it and he also told me I should have told my kid to let her win

106,1cx6byx,AITA for saying no to take care of my brother’s pets while he’s out of town for an emergency? ,"I am 9 months pregnant, just a couple weeks away from giving birth. And my mom had been wanting to come to help my husband (26) and I (24) ever since we found out we were having a baby. 

My brother (32) lives an hour ish away, and we’ve been pretty much “sharing” our mom since we are both her kids and she wants to be with us both; even if my brother mostly just wants our mom to come over to help him clean and keep his house together—cuz he and his fiancée are both slobs and don’t know how to handle a household.
She is with me now but he still asks her sometimes if she can come just to do a quick “clean up”. We are pretty close even tho his father is not my father; we grew up together and have an ok relationship. 

He found out over the weekend his father has been hiding a bad illness from him and he’s now in the hospital. So my brother decided he will be leaving the country this week since this emergency has come up. 
He has a fish, a hamster and a dog that are my nieces. And his fiancée—who’s apparently got very bad anxiety and codependency, is coming too. 
She can’t stay behind to take care of things while my brother is gone or she will “loose her mind”. And since they’re both leaving, he’s asking our mom to take care of his pets until the end of the week. 

Husband and I have 2 dogs and a guinea pig and instead of asking a friend or neighbor, he asked our mom to take care of these things, and she came up with the idea of bringing all his pets here, so she can take care of them and also wait for our baby to arrive at the same time. 
This would mean that our house would be fuller, we would need to take care of 3 more pets, keep switching between kennels for our dogs since they hate each other. So I would be putting my own dogs away in their own house, which I think is kinda unfair. 
I told my mom I would rather have her go to my brother’s place and save myself from the headache and the stress of it considering our baby could come at any point. But she’s sad that she is trying to help us both, and by going to my brother’s place, she could potentially miss the birth of our child. 

My husband and I feel abandoned and pretty hurt since this is not the first nor the last time my brother just throws us under the bus for his personal agenda. And this also means that our mom much is leaving us during these important times. 
I want to support my brother in this tough time, but i feel like I’m the one getting screwed over, i think everything could go smoothly if his fiancée stayed back and took care of their house, instead of asking our mom. 

I also get our mom’s pov and how this could be painful for her since she wants to help us both.

I responded not leaving because of the butter it’s because “you huffed and stomped away.” Then she said “you were being pushy”.

So my friend brings a guest over to my house only on the agreement that guest cannot stay here for the night due to shady actions such as theft prior but I agree that he can COME OVER to my home but must leave when it comes time to at night. It was very clear that my friend and I were both understood those specific terms and agreed to them. Friend repeatedly tells guest they must leave eventually when it starts to get late and find somewhere to stay at. When it comes time for them to leave, guest has nowhere to go and friend is “trying to call someone for them to stay with” for the past 3 hours. It is now 3 am as I’ve been waiting for supposed person friend contacted to respond.

I allowed them to stay here until midnight originally passed when I wanted but oh well, however now it’s become apparent that friend is most likely stalling for time (I do not know this for sure just a hunch) , feel like friend knows guest has no one to contact/nowhere to go and trying to pull on my heartstrings since I’d be kicking guest to the streets at 3 am. Am I the asshole for holding strong with my agreement made with my friend and having to kick the guest to the street? I feel like it’s a shitty thing to do but I also feel like I should hold strong with my boundaries and the initial agreement made.

To be specific, I've asked for three things: for the inside of a knitting implement to be sanded down as it was catching and damaging my yarn (requested two years ago), a pair of hackle (wool) combs (requested last September), and top whorl drop spindles (getting on for a month ago now) made in a particular way so I can make them nice with polymer clay and sell them on (I have made it clear that I would be more than happy to pay for everything, too).

None of them have been done. And when I asked him to make the spindles originally, he immediately decided he was going to make them out of aluminum because HE thought that would be better, even though I stated that I wanted them made out of wood. 

Here's the thing: I live clear across the other side of town to most of my family. My gran and great aunt, who live next door to each other and are close to him and my  cousin, regularly ask him to do jobs that actually do get done. I just kinda feel... Forgotten, I guess. 

I should also say that they have a son who is severely on the spectrum. He needs a lot of help and care and I can understand that he comes first, but then I see other people's more recent jobs being completed regardless, so... Yeah. 

So, context provided (hopefully), here's my question: WIBTA if I went onto Facebook, in the local groups that he and the rest of my family are also in, and asked if there was anyone local who's willing to help me? I'm tired of waiting for jobs to be done when others decide they will be (I.e. Never), and I need these things done.

I have 2 sisters Alexandra and Vanessa. While I love both my sisters I was always closer to Alexandra.

Recently my wife and I had a baby girl. We both quickly agreed on a first name but we couldn't agree on a middle name. I finally suggested that we could use Alexandra as her middle name and my wife who is also close to her agreed.

Well when I told everyone about our decision Vanessa wasn't happy about it. She asked if we have a fucking problem with her and we said we don't. She then asked then why would you name her after her and not me? Why is everyone always naming kids after her?

To be clear one of my brothers has a daughter whose middle name is Lexi and another one has a son whose name is Xander but it's not like we are doing this on purpose they just liked those names that's all.

Now Vanessa thinks we are all assholes especially because she was a great help to us during my wife's pregnancy but to be clear Alexandra was also a great help to us.

edit: Ok I didn't expect this to get so much attention. There is a lot of assumptions in the comments so I'm gonna clarify a few things:  
1. No my niblings were not named after Alexandra. It was truly an accident that the names are similar. It's just a joke between us that all the kids are named after her when it is not true at all

2. No Alexandra is not the golden child and some of you need to go touch some grass seriously.

117,1cx3os6,WIBTA for starting to charge our kids rent?,"Our 2 oldest are 19 and 18 and live at home. Our oldest is in college but is dropping out for at least a yr as she doesn't know what she wants to major in so she wants to take a break to figure it out and she is hoping to move states with her bf in the next yr or so. My 18 yr old was doing online HS but in the last mo th or so kinda fell behind and just came to us saying she isn't going to complete her HS diploma requirements in time to graduate. She does have 2 part time jobs and has been looking into GED programs. Now their Dad and I have brought up the subject of rent and while they didn't seem to mind at he cost seemed to be out of left field for them. We live in WA state and have a pretty high min wage. Once summer starts they will both be working full time. Rent will include everything with 1 meal a day (dinner). Any special foods/snacks will be covered by them along with personal items but we will cover normal household items like toilet paper, shampoo/conditioner, toothpaste etc. If rent is paid we will not expect them to do chores except the normal pick up after yourself, do your dishes and laundry etc. Now for the cost...we were thinking of charging 500 a month everything included. When my 19 yr old was in college we didn't charge her rent at all, and if she would have stayed enrolled we would have let her stay rent free but not now that she is dropping out. Our 18 yr old isn't paying until summer when school is technically over as she isn't going to college right away anyway and was planning a gap yr even before she decided not to get her HSD. They are both mad at us and think that 500 is too much. If we broke down everything not including food into 5ths it would be a little over 600 so I think 500 with dinners included is a great deal but they don't as it almost pays our mortgage. Am I expecting them to pay an unreasonable amount? 

Edit: 18 yr old just started her second job yesterday. As for school she was finishing her senior yr online as she wasn't living g at home at the beginning of the school yr and online HS was easier for her at the time. When she moved back home she continued with it and continued to tell us she was keeping up.  She came to her Dad about a week ago saying she wasn't going to graduate and she started falling behind around a month and a half ago but didn't want to tell us. We didn't realize as we trusted her and her work hrs were under 20 a week. 

Also rent prices in our area aren't outrageous but also aren't cheap. For a studio apartment in a decent area it's between 1200-1500 a month not including pet fees and other bills. They can't move in with my oldest bf as he lives out of state and is in the USAF.

118,1cx3kk2,AITA for not giving my parents the baby blanket my great grandma made for me so they can use it for my baby sister?,"My great grandma made a baby blanket for me when my mom was pregnant. She did that for all her kids, grandkids and then great-grandkids. I was the youngest until now. Great grandma would make it clear to the parents involved that the baby she made the blankets for should be considered the owners and it shouldn't be something they kept from us. So this is what always happened. I always had mine. My parents did try to take it from me a few times but great grandma stepped in each and every time. I loved mine because she had started experimenting with her knitting and my blanket is more unique than the rest and feels just a little more personal. I treasure it despite being a 17 year old guy. I treasure it more because great grandma died when I was 10 and I miss her like crazy.

So my parents couldn't have more kids for years. They tried for years and even did IVF when I was 7 but didn't have another kid from it. Their focus being so set on that, I always felt like I wasn't good enough. This is something extended family brought to their attention a few times. It was comments like ""I just want a baby so bad, I can't imagine my life without a child"" from my mom and comments from my dad like ""we feel so incomplete without a baby"" that would get family members to take notice. Those were some of the kinds of comments that left me feeling as I do. It was never ""another baby"" it was always ""a baby"" like I was invisible. They talked about having a baby being their biggest dream. It stung so much to have their life focus around that and they'd get so depressed about not having a baby. Great grandma, before she died, told them to be thankful for ""the blessing"" (aka me) and how they already had a baby and they were letting me grow up without them. It didn't change anything. And I did basically grow up without my parents. They have no idea who my friends are or what's going on in my life.

This was a surprise pregnancy and my parents are so excited. They did all the early tests to find out they're having a girl and they started shopping and all kinds of stuff for her. But then my mom got sad because great grandma isn't around to knit her a blanket too. So they told me they wanted mine. They didn't ask. They told me. And when I said no they grew angry. They said she deserves to have a blanket from great grandma and their baby needs one. I asked what I was and they said ""an almost grown man"". I left the blanket with my best friend because I was afraid my parents would search the house to find it. They were so pissed and they started doing the guilt trips saying my baby sister deserves better and how can I look at myself in the mirror knowing I don't want to share this with her. They told me it's like I don't even want her to exist or I hate her for something and she's not even born yet.

So trust has been broken. And bodily fluids have ruined my couch. I’ve washed the couch covers but I don’t think I can ever look at or sit on that couch again. N has apologised to me for what happened, but I don’t think it fixes things.

120,1cx38q4,AITA for telling my ILs their attitude around family is why I kept the truth about my family from them for so long?,"I (25f) married Ryan (25m) 7 months ago. His family and I get along fine... but for 6 years they had no idea about my family background. And the reason is because they are so family orientated and so naive to the reality of unhappy and toxic families, that they come across as preachy about being close. This is something Ryan warned me about and spoke to them about before. They still comment on it regularly though.

I don't speak to my family. I have a dad who raised me and a half brother I was raised alongside half of my life. I'm an affair baby and that came between me and my half brother always. My mother didn't stick around long enough for me to ever know her and I never tried to track her down later. My dad ignored how damaging it was to have my half brother always throw in my face how much he and his mom wished I didn't exist. Dad would also try to make his ex-wife and me interact and she'd get so pissed I would hear her tell him she'd rather be dead than interact with me. The last time I saw my half brother was when he was 22 and he told me to my face he would never love me or consider me part of his family and he saw me as repulsive just like our dad. My dad heard this and he still dismissed how much that would hurt. So I don't speak to my dad anymore by choice and my half brother and I don't talk by his own choice. Any extended family treat me like I had the affair because they're closer to dad's ex wife than dad. I was a casualty of that. Plus they adore my half brother and he made it clear he didn't want me to be around.

I don't talk about it often and very few people know. I didn't tell my ILs for years because of their attitudes around family and when I did, a few weeks before I married Ryan, the reaction at first was somewhat surprising because they said nothing judgmental. But ever since that point they have talked about my half brother a lot and even his mom and for some reason they feel like me reaching out to them would heal everything and we'd skip into the sunset arm in arm. Ryan told them it wasn't going to happen and to let it drop. So they got more subtle or less direct. But a week ago they brought it up again and they told me how much better my life would be if I put in the effort to heal these relationships because family is everything. Ryan told them not all biological families are equal. They told him they're still essential for us though. I told them it wasn't true in my case and my half brother's mom isn't related to me in any way. And that my half brother is repulsed by me, he considers me filthy because I'm an affair baby. I told them that's not something I can fix from simply reaching out and I told them this very attitude about family is why I never told them for so long.

Ryan had my back but his family were extremely upset by my words. MILs anger was the most clear and she told me it's unfair to judge them for wanting families to be healthy and that's all they try to help with.

My dad heard this and he still dismissed how much that would hurt. So I don't speak to my dad anymore by choice and my half brother and I don't talk by his own choice. Any extended family treat me like I had the affair because they're closer to dad's ex wife than dad. I was a casualty of that. Plus they adore my half brother and he made it clear he didn't want me to be around.

I don't talk about it often and very few people know. I didn't tell my ILs for years because of their attitudes around family and when I did, a few weeks before I married Ryan, the reaction at first was somewhat surprising because they said nothing judgmental. But ever since that point they have talked about my half brother a lot and even his mom and for some reason they feel like me reaching out to them would heal everything and we'd skip into the sunset arm in arm. Ryan told them it wasn't going to happen and to let it drop. So they got more subtle or less direct. But a week ago they brought it up again and they told me how much better my life would be if I put in the effort to heal these relationships because family is everything. Ryan told them not all biological families are equal. They told him they're still essential for us though. I told them it wasn't true in my case and my half brother's mom isn't related to me in any way. And that my half brother is repulsed by me, he considers me filthy because I'm an affair baby. I told them that's not something I can fix from simply reaching out and I told them this very attitude about family is why I never told them for so long.

Ryan had my back but his family were extremely upset by my words. MILs anger was the most clear and she told me it's unfair to judge them for wanting families to be healthy and that's all they try to help with.

121,1cx34wv,AITA for not listening to my friend and causing her to snap,"I (26 F) was living with my best friend of 4 years (34 F) I’ll call her Crimson.
In April this year, Crimson decided that she wanted to move and this meant I had to move as well. Side note our neighbours/friends were also moving.
Leading up to the move I packed up most of my things and put it in my mum’s storage container, as I would be moving in with her. Crimson was moving in with her boyfriend and had to get rid of a lot of her stuff. She essentially had to turn a house into a bedroom, as her boyfriend didn’t have room for all her stuff. Crimson spent sometime packing/sorting though her things and I help when I could. She also spent a lot of time helping our friends pack (35 F & 40 F). In my opinion they didn’t need the help, however I know Crimson was just trying to be a good friend. A week before we would be moving, Crimson went to her boyfriend’s house (in another state), to see him and also her stepdad. Her stepdad had a trailer and was going to help her move. While she was gone I stayed home and looked after her 2 cats.

Crimson had spoken to me about expectations she had for how things would go/be done when her and her stepdad got there. She told me the things she wanted, but at no point asked me if they would work for me and therefore I never agree to any of them. This included me having all my stuff sorted, so we could purely focus on her stuff and based off of her words it sounded like she wanted me to have nothing left at the house, but the clothes on my back. I only had one last carload of stuff and I wanted to do only one last trip to mum’s (30 minutes drive), despite Crimson wanting it all done even if that meant doing multiple trips. I was not coping with all the change and was struggling mentally. I talked to Crimson about this and cried to her in the phone. I felt I needed to put myself first and told Crimson I only had one carload and that I would finish packing the day of the move and then I’d help her with her stuff. The day before the move Crimson arrived with her stepdad and that night her and I sorted/packed as much of her stuff as we could. Before going to bed I reminded Crimson that I would be packing my car then I could help her with her things. The next day Crimson and her stepdad got started on her things and I sorted out mine. I’ll admit my packing took longer than I thought it would, but I managed to get mine done and started to help the others. During all the packing Crimson snapped at me, yelled that my stuff should have been sorted and blamed me for her stepdad “having a go at her” for not having her stuff sorted. In my opinion, he was being reasonable and was just annoyed because it hadn’t been sorted before and he didn’t want to dilly-dally. I apologised for my stuff taking longer than I thought. I tried to not dwell on it because I knew she was stressed. Crimson later apologised for snapping, after her stepdad told her to.

123,1cx2yvj,AITA for saying no to letting my brother in law drive my car when they visit ,"We are flying home for a wedding on my side of the family in July for about a week. It just so happens that the same week of the wedding is the week that they had booked their flights to come out. We’d discussed them staying at the house while we were actually going to be there and then a day later found out the date of the wedding happened to be in the middle of the week they had scheduled to come out.  I have no issue with them staying at the house while we are gone because we live in Hawaii and hotels out here aren’t cheap but my brother in law is now asking if they can use my car while they are here and we are gone. 

Here’s the issue. I got here about 9 months ago and bought a cheaper older car trying to save some money and I’ve had issues with it since two weeks after buying it. I’ve driven it less than 30 times in the last 9 months, it having spent 3 months at an auto repair shop while they tried to figure out what was wrong with it. After so long, we decided to purchase a newer, 2021, vehicle with a loan so that I would have a reliable car to get to work as I had a distance to drive. With all the trouble I’ve had when it comes to cars over the last 9 months, I’m uneasy about letting anyone else drive my car especially when we will be nowhere near home. If anything happens, that’s a dock on my insurance which will raise my rates, I’m out of a vehicle again and have to buy another vehicle and finding cars out here is not as easy as it may seem. 

My husband is irritated because he thinks I’d do it with my side of the family but that would have been with the older crappy car that if it got hit, it wasn’t a huge loss. And realistically, they wouldn’t have been driving it anyway because I would have been off work and taking them everywhere. Even with my newer car, I wouldn’t full super comfortable letting my family drive it because of the horrible luck with cars I’ve had. 

AITA and overthinking this or it reasonable to decline since we are already helping them out by letting them stay at the house and saving some money?

124,1cx2xel,AITA for calling out my parents for expecting more out of me than they expect from my older sister?,"I (15f) have one sister (17f) and we do not get along. We were never close, like ever, and we fight a lot when we're around each other too much. Our parents will bring us together more as a family when the fights get more frequent because they think that'll fix things and bring us closer together. I know she always hated it and I started hating it after I realized we'd never have a close relationship or even be friends really. I don't know how it started.

I feel like it had to start before either of us were old enough to remember, like when we were toddlers, but I can't prove that clearly. She does things that hurts my feelings or pisses me off. I know she says my general presence is annoying for her and that she feels like I steal from her all the time, because my parents dressed me in her old clothes and gave me her old toys when we were younger and they still make me take some of her old clothes still, which is more awkward because our bodies are way different now.

The most civil we generally are is when we're just not speaking to each other. I admit that I struggle to let go of some things she's said before and that I react badly if she says something that reminds me of that. Like she has told me a million times she wishes she was an only child and how nothing good comes from having siblings. She'll say I would be more tolerable as a brother. Or her favorite thing is telling me that she proudly claims she's an only child when none of our family are around. But then she'll say something about how lucky our cousins are to have siblings or how she always wanted a sister and it pisses me off.

We don't support each other. If we had a choice we would never go to each other's stuff for family support. Our parents make us go. But something I noticed a lot is my sister will be on her phone or will sit and sulk if she has to come and our parents let it happen. Now she has a dance production coming up and my parents told me I'm coming to support her and cancelled my plans that were already in place so I can go with them. They didn't stop there though. They told me they expect me to actually cheer for my sister when we go and root for her like sisters should. I brought up that she never does that for me. They told me just because she doesn't support me doesn't mean I can't support her and how much they're relying on me doing this. I pointed out how unfair that is and called them out for expecting more out of me than they do from her. I told them I never sulk or look all around me but she's not someone I would support and they shouldn't expect more from me than showing up when they don't expect the same from her. They told me it's not a very grown up way to look at things and that I'm acting very much like the spoiled little sister and that I can't expect them to treat us the same and I'm being unfair expecting it.

One thing I worry about though is his family. Mum, dad, younger brother ""Matt"" and his girlfriend ""Susan"" (both 24).

For some reason it feels like they are looking down on Sam. For example: If Matt takes out a small loan to renovate the flat, everyone is supportive, but when we do it, we are questioned about responibility (even though we are financially better off). I'd understand if Sam and I had a history of beeing irresponsible, but we are doing really well for ourselves and never had any issues. Sam says he is used to it and it doesn't bother him, but he understands my frustration and is always really supportive and sticks up for me if need be.

Recently, we got a cat. She is a lovely, healthy ball of energy and we immediatly bonded with eachother. Matt and Susan also adopted a cat not long ago. Again, everyone was excited for them and we were hit with the ""you know a pet is a responisbility, right?"" but whatever, let them talk. Yesterday, we had invited his family. As soon as they entered, they started complaining. ""Why is the scratching post here and not there?"", ""Why are you giving her this food brand?"", ""Why are you using this litter?"". They brought some toys and also some cat food (which they say is 100 times better than the one we use) which I didn't mind, but Susan also brought a supplement paste.

I thanked her, but told her to please take it with her again since I don't want to give my cat supplements which are not approved by her vet, who confirmed she is the picture of health last friday. At first she said okay, but when I came back from the toilet, I saw Susan giving our cat the paste. 

I snatched the paste from her and told her she had crossed a line, and while his family tried to defend her actions because ""she just wants to help"", I said that their ""help"" is not appreciated and that I will no longer allow them to question everything we do. I also find it highly concerning that they are okay with going explicitly against what I said and starting immediatly, I expect them to keep ther unsolicited advice to themselves and they will have to earn back our trust in respecting our wishes. They said I was too dramatic over a cat, so I said ""If I can't even be comfortable around you regarding my cat, I sure as hell won't be comfortable having you around our kids!""

","I(18f) am part of a friendship trio with 2 other girls both 19. Around a year ago one of my friends ""Nes"" started becoming very awkward around my other friend ""Anne"". At first both me and ""Anne"" ignored it but gradually it got worse. It went from being ""Ness"" being awkward around ""Anne"" to straight up leaving the room whenever ""Anne"" came to meet us. 

The actual issue where i became a part of this ""beef"" started a few days ago when i went to the roof and ""Ness"" was already there. I didnt know ""Ness"" would be there so i had called '""Anne"" over to the roof because that was our hangout spot. I didnt tell ""Ness"" that ""Anne"" was coming and we were talking like usual UNTIL ""Anne"" appeared at which ""Ness"" made some half assed excuse of having to take a call and leaving in 5 mins.

As she walked off ""Anne"" asked me what ""Ness's"" issue with her was to which i said i dont know. So ""Anne"" asked me to ask ""Ness"" what the problem was and if it was something they had to discuss. ""Anne"" asked me to do it because ""Ness"" hadnt acknowledged her any of the times they were in the same room opting to scroll on her phone.

So I did. I asked her and she said she was 'uncomfortable' around ""Anne"". i asked her for the reason for her feeling uncomfortable around ""Anne"" and she started bitching at me as to how she wasnt entitled to tell me why she feels this way. in response to that i said ""ok but i think you need to respect ""Anne"" enough to tell her what the problem is since she's an active participant in this seemingly one sided feud"". upon hearing this she stormed away before i could say anything else. i went back to ""Anne"" and told her what happened when ""Ness"" called me telling me to put it on speaker. There she rambled on about how it was between her and ""Anne"" and that ""Anne"" had no right to speak to her after what she had done and also asked me to meet her only if ""Anne"" wasnt there. then she promptly cut the call before ""Anne"" could open her mouth.

Fast forward to yesterday ""Anne"" coudnt come to meet me so i called ""Ness"" and asked if she wanted to meet. Immediately she started going off on me about how i didnt respect her enough and that i took 2 days to call her because i preferred to spend time with ""Anne"" more. (I did exactly what she told me to do and ""Anne"" lives in another part of the city because of college and came over for the break. I hadnt seen her in a few months.) and i shouldnt have gotten in the middle of their feud i told her it wasnt my fault that she wouldnt look ""Anne"" in the face and have enough decency to solve the issue together. she started screaming some more and cut the call before i could say anything more.

So i called her again and asked her ""who tf she thought she was to cut a call just because she had nothing more to add and that she was an entitled selfish bitch for not thinking about how her actions affect others"".

(I did exactly what she told me to do and ""Anne"" lives in another part of the city because of college and came over for the break. I hadnt seen her in a few months.) and i shouldnt have gotten in the middle of their feud i told her it wasnt my fault that she wouldnt look ""Anne"" in the face and have enough decency to solve the issue together. she started screaming some more and cut the call before i could say anything more.

So i called her again and asked her ""who tf she thought she was to cut a call just because she had nothing more to add and that she was an entitled selfish bitch for not thinking about how her actions affect others"".

127,1cx2s2m,AITA for refusing to pay for this guy?,"I'm a 23-year-old male who works at a gas station alongside my full-time studies, so I'm busy seven days a week.

One day, while I was working, my sister offered to pick me up with her husband since they were in the area. I agreed, as long as it wasn't too much trouble for them.

After my shift ended, I was waiting for them when a young man on a motorcycle approached me and asked how to use the self-service pump. I explained it to him, and just then my sister arrived. I also explained to him that he could only pay with bills or a card. He asked if I could pay with my card and he would give me the cash, as he didn't have his card with him. I declined, not just because he had enough cash, but also because I was tired from my shift and had to get up early for college the next day. So I wanted to get home quickly.

In the car, my sister started questioning why I didn't help him, saying he would have given me the money. My brother-in-law was on my side and said that since he had enough cash, I did the right thing.

When I got home, I took a shower while my mom made dinner. She went for a walk with my sister, leaving me to finish cooking, set the table, eat, and then clean up.

As I was lying down, I heard them talking about the incident through the open window. Not wanting to argue, I pretended to be asleep.

For extra context, I lost my father when I was 15 and have taken on responsibilities since then. My mother doesn't work, but we're financially stable—not wealthy, but doing okay. I started working at the gas station to pay for a car, which we needed. I took on extra shifts to cover the initial costs and now I'm paying it off. I don't go out often or buy new things as long as the stuff I have (clothes, shoes) is still usable to avoid unnecessary spending.

They said some hurtful things, labeling me as cheap for not buying new stuff. They also mentioned that someone else would have paid for the young man since he was young and the amount wasn't significant.

128,1cx2i58,AITA for refusing to allow a pregnant couple to stay at my house?,"Hi All,

*Throw away account.

My partner's (we'll call him Jim) brother Jack and girlfriend Jane recently found out they were pregnant.
Both 23 but have only been together 4 months.
Both live at home with their parents (both single parents). He works full time as a 2nd year apprentice and she works part time while doing college.

They are both scared and excited but seem a bit naive to the reality of raising a baby. They don't have a plan about how they would cope or living arrangements etc.

Jim and I are older (37) and are comfortably setup (no children), however I've made it clear I don't want them to rely on us for somewhere to live or money, they have to manage this situation themselves. Jim and I agreed on this expecting some kind of request for help.

As expected, the first request came asking that they stay with us till they can get some money together after the baby is born.
We said no. They complained and said we have spare rooms and they will contribute.

Our concerns are:
1. This will become a financial burden on us and we will end up paying many of their expenses
2. I don't know Jane I've met her 3 times and don't know how she would be to live with
3. I work from home 3 days a week and need some quiet, thats going to be hard with a baby around
4. I know her family and friends are all close and spend a lot of time together. I don't want my house to be a hangout spot for people I don't know
5. They would not give a timeframe, there has been no planning here so I have no idea how long they would even stay or if they would stick to a plan anyway
6. They also couldn't confirm their plan after they get money together,  no idea about the area they would live in,  the cost of rent and utilities etc.

We know that they are welcome at Jacks mothers house, they will just have to make do with 1 room for the 3 of them. Jacks mother also gets heavily subsidised utilities so it will have a minimal impact to them from a financial perspective.

Ever since we said no, their family has been hounding us and acting like we are abandoning them.
They are not out on the street, they are just going to be in an a tight space and inconvienienced for a while.

I'm pretty firm on this stance, they are not entitled to our space or resources and made a choice to have a baby but made no independent plans on how to manage it. 

Would be interested to hear other peoples views on this, AITA or are they being entitled?

******Update******

So I'm getting a very strong vote of NTA, and top themes are I'll never get them out, they will stay on as tenant, and I'll become a babysitter.
All valid points, and I'm in complete agreement with all of it.

One other point many have made is why don't the family members take them in. To be fair, they will always help where they can, but none are in a position to put people up (no space, live in other states etc).  They don't, however, have the right to chastise us, and this has now been made crystal clear.

We are open to helping out in some other ways, we would be happy to give them a bond for a rental, provide some appliances or furniture they may need. This would have been something we would have done if they were moving without a baby involved. 
That will still be an offer on the table if they accept what we've said, if they push or if they get anyone else involved, we will be doing nothing.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for refusing to allow a pregnant couple to stay at my house? Hi All,

130,1cx2bqa,AITA for working too much?,"
For reference I (22F) have been dating my bf (23M) for 9 months, living together for 3 months. Let's call him Jerry. Before I moved in with Jerry, he was a wonderful boyfriend, driving the 3½ hours one way for me, constantly going out on dates, complimenting my personality and helping around my mother's house when he came to visit me.
Before I moved in, he was getting evicted for having cats in a non-pet friendly place. Shortly after, he found a place where he was allowed to have cats, but would greatly diminish his quality of life, so ever the optimist, I decided to move in with him since things seemed to be going well. I was told getting work would be easy.

 Here comes the twist:

After I moved in  it took me about a month to find a job, in that time he had to foot my portion of the bills since I was moving states. His family nagged my about finding work, so I did all the house-work while job hunting in order to feel useful. I've met all of his family, while he's only met almost none of mine

After a couple weeks, I felt like a maid. I ended up breaking down because even if I had held off housekeeping for him to come home from work, he wouldn't do it. He ended up just telling me to quit cleaning. On his days off he would just play video games. Within the second month, I ended up not getting 1 job, but 2. Understanding that although I would be tired; I'd suck it up and keep my share of the house-work up. 
I've been working for around a month, sometimes working 13 hour days, just to come home to cook, clean, and take care of the cats (that he's actually allergic to). We're doing better financially, but now the only compliments I get are about how beautiful I am, and how good my body looks. Plus he'll occasionally make a comment about how ""you're stuck here with me"".

We've had a conversation about how I'm unhappy, and I was considering leaving, and he said things along the lines of ""so you're just giving up on 'us' then?"". So I sucked it up and decided to stay a little bit longer.

It's been 3 months and things still haven't changed, even though he's promised they would. I'm exhausted and get about 1 day off every 10, and he gets all weekends off. We haven't been on a single date since I moved in, and I haven't been asking for help around the house.

To add to the context, she had an abusive partner previously living in this house that made her do everything. Now I'm the one doing almost everything.

134,1cx0x84,AITA for taking a creepy picture of my friend?,"to preface this, i (17M🏳️‍⚧️) am autistic and i have ADHD. i often act/talk impulsively and without thinking about how what i do/say will come off to those around me. like, i'll do something and think ""lol this is silly"" without thinking about any possible alternative meanings; it just doesnt come to mind. im working on it.

this happened a few months ago at our school prom, but it recently popped into my head and it's been bothering me since.

i was with one of my more fem friends. we were in the outside area of the venue taking pictures. i held up my phone take a goofy picture of them, and then i tilted the camera up at the last second to get an above angle picture. 

my friends and i take silly angle pictures of each other all the time, so that's what was going through my head: ""hehe silly big forehead picture""

anyway, i am getting married next march to the love of my life. this june, i am having an engagement party. my moh found out that my other bridesmaids will have plus ones but i am not giving her one. she told one of our other friends that it isn’t fair that she is being singled out and i should at least let her bring the guy she is currently dating to the engagement party because it’s at a park pavilion.

my other friend said maybe i should let her bring him because it would be nice and she wouldn’t be alone. i don’t agree because she knows 90% of the people who will be at the party. plus i invited people from HER family to the party so there is no way she will be alone.

One of our friends moved to Miami almost two years ago, and naturally, we don’t speak as often as we used to when we were living in the same city, but still, whenever she’s in town visiting we try to meet up.

This friend that lives in Miami recently got engaged and told us in our group chat that she wanted to have a small wedding (only 10 guests) and that we were not invited, but she wanted us to hear this directly from her so we wouldn’t be surprised. Most of us were chill with this decision of hers and sent her good wishes. Even after this news, we still planned on throwing her a bachelorette party in Cancun after she got married (a bit late, I know). In addition to this, one of our friends traveled to Miami to participate on a bachelorette party her new friends were throwing her, and even told our friend (the bachelorette) that if she was struggling economically, we (the friends from Mexico) would be more than happy to help her pay for the wedding. The bachelorette replied that she simply didn’t want us there because she wanted a small wedding. Again, we respected this decision and tried not to take it personally.

A few weeks later we found out that the bachelorette had invited one of our girlfriends and that they were all traveling to Puerto Escondido (a beach in Mexico) in june.

Turns out it’s the same weekend as the wedding to which we’re not invited (and that theoretically we didn’t know the specific details of when and where it was happening). We figured we would still go to this beach, as it’s a place we all really like, and planned on having our separate plans from the crew that is going to the wedding.

I went through the withdrawals and dealt with them, now I feel normal. Little to no anxiety, just some headaches.

But, for the past 2 weeks she's been becoming cold and distant when she didn't get her way.

She's been becoming too bossy and I have to get off my butt to try to please her just so she'd go back to her sweet usual self(I have nice guy tendencies that I'm always working on fixing). Her mood switches at the smallest things.

  
When she tries to communicate, I'm wrong if I try to come up with a solution to what her problem is or I'm also wrong if I try to listen and understand.

  
It became unbearable for the past 2 dates when I started calling her out on her rude behaviour. She'd walk away and me being her only ride home and she can't take an uber (She's doesn't have the financial means to) would start following her around and have to sweet talk her just so I can take her back home.



The problem is she does that in public around people, and other people have to sometimes see me walk behind her to talk to her while she tries to walk away(Sometimes I feel like she knows I'm going to do that so she walks away intentionally just so I'd cave) I'm a really private person.

142,1cwzwnw,AITA for refusing to move house?,"So this is probably a boring one but I need an unbiased opinion.

I(31F) and husband (31M) have 5 kids. 4 live with us (12F, 10F, 3M and 9mM) and 1 (7F) lives with her mum.

My husband has this awful habit of job hopping, Im a SAHM with a side hustle which covers most of the bills so I’m lucky with that. 
Now my husband was offered a job with a promotion and a pay rise (20K extra per year)- the only issue was that it was an hour away from where we live and the hours would change. Instead of 6am-3pm, it would be 3am-12pm. 

He came home and discussed it with me, I made it clear that I wasn’t ready to move so he would be either getting a place down there to stay during the week or he would have to drive to and from every day. 

He said he was okay with driving to and from. 

The reasons I don’t want to move-

*We’re paying $1750(?) a month for a 4 bedroom house (350 a week).
*Ive been here for almost 10 years, longer than him and I have been together. 
*Rent where he works is an extra 200+ a week for a 4 bedroom.
*Our children’s other parents live here, meaning we would have to drive the hour up here every weekend anyway to see them.
*Our 3M son starts kindergarten next year and my oldest daughter starts high school, I don’t want to move her away from her friends during this transition.
*I keep having anxiety about this job hopping habit of his. He’s been there since March and has already mentioned a few times that he wants to leave, I said after 6 months we can discuss moving possibly but he didn’t like that compromise. 

Today he came home cracking it that I was killing him because “I won’t move closer and that I put a value on his life of $350”, because he’s fatigued cause he wakes up at 1.30am. 
I tell him to go to bed earlier or stay at a motel there during the week but he says he can’t afford it.

I know if I rebudget and cancel some things we could probably afford it, but with the housing market the way it is at the moment also makes me nervous.

So unbiased opinions, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for refusing to move house? So this is probably a boring one but I need an unbiased opinion.

I(31F) and husband (31M) have 5 kids. 4 live with us (12F, 10F, 3M and 9mM) and 1 (7F) lives with her mum.

My husband has this awful habit of job hopping, Im a SAHM with a side hustle which covers most of the bills so I’m lucky with that. 
Now my husband was offered a job with a promotion and a pay rise (20K extra per year)- the only issue was that it was an hour away from where we live and the hours would change. Instead of 6am-3pm, it would be 3am-12pm. 

He came home and discussed it with me, I made it clear that I wasn’t ready to move so he would be either getting a place down there to stay during the week or he would have to drive to and from every day. 

He said he was okay with driving to and from. 

The reasons I don’t want to move-

*We’re paying $1750(?) a month for a 4 bedroom house (350 a week).
*Ive been here for almost 10 years, longer than him and I have been together. 
*Rent where he works is an extra 200+ a week for a 4 bedroom.
*Our children’s other parents live here, meaning we would have to drive the hour up here every weekend anyway to see them.
*Our 3M son starts kindergarten next year and my oldest daughter starts high school, I don’t want to move her away from her friends during this transition.
*I keep having anxiety about this job hopping habit of his. He’s been there since March and has already mentioned a few times that he wants to leave, I said after 6 months we can discuss moving possibly but he didn’t like that compromise. 

Today he came home cracking it that I was killing him because “I won’t move closer and that I put a value on his life of $350”, because he’s fatigued cause he wakes up at 1.30am. 
I tell him to go to bed earlier or stay at a motel there during the week but he says he can’t afford it.

Pretty early on he was mistreating our animals, having a bad attitude towards us and will argue with us everytime we told him to clean up after himself or his pets. A couple of weeks ago he brought a new girl into our house and got straight into a relationship with her with no intention on covering down on her expenses and she has no job. With a total of our $1460 of rent he only pays a 3rd and doesn't pay us for any utilities. Jumping forward to this previous Friday, my husband and I got really sick we ended up falling asleep early and while we were sleeping him and his girlfriend took our car without our knowledge or our permission and crashed it. The vehicle was totaled and insurance is not planning on paying it off unless I tell them the truth and report it stolen. The vehicle is under my mom's insurance and if it's not reported as stolen then it's gonna hurt my mom by increasing the insurance. And she is already struggling with money as is taking care of my disabled father. I didn't want to but even after he crashed our vehicle he didn't want to pay to get it out the wreckage yard and is still giving us the same bad attitude and mistreating our animals.

145,1cwyvq1,AITA for asking my grandma to stay in a hotel room instead of sleeping in my room? ,"Never thought I'd have to write one of these but here we are. 

So, I (17f) am graduating high-school this week. And as such, a few family members, including my grandma (70f), are coming from various neighboring states to see me walk. Now, usually, when my grandmother comes to visit us, she stays at our house and sleeps in my room, and I sleep on an air mattress in the living room or in our home office. 

It's important that I mention that I have adhd, autism, and anxiety, which result in me having a lot of issues surrounding sleep. The only way I can get a solid 8 to 10 is if I'm in total darkness and total silence. Thus, I have spent a lot of time (and money) making sure I can sleep comfortably in my room. Blackout curtains over the windows, black electrical tape over all the electronics that have lights, I even bought and replaced the ceiling fan for a quieter one. And yes, my mom knows about my neurodivergencies and needs. 

Anyway, as you can imagine, I don't do well when I can't sleep in my room. I usually have awful sleep and wake up cranky and exhausted the next day. Not being able to sleep in my room throws off my entire routine and schedule as well. The second to last time she visited (for my sister's graduation), she stayed for almost two weeks. I was so thrown out of wack that I didn't eat for three days and had a massive meltdown when we got home from her graduation because I was so hungry and tired. 

So, this time around, when my mom mentioned that we needed to start cleaning for our guests, I asked her if she could tell grandma to get a hotel room and explained my reasons. She told me no and essentially said 'no, I don't care. She always stays in your room. I'm not just going to kick my mom out.' I argued that since it's my graduation, a day about celebrating me, and my needs should take precedence. She again said no, so I just walked away. 

I then decided, since she's not going to put my needs first, I will. I texted my grandma and politely asked if she could get a hotel room instead of sleeping in my room and explained my reasons and adding on that, with her arthritis, it would be easier on her since she wouldn't have to climb our stairs (which are very steep). She texted back saying 'Of course she would get a hotel room if that would make it easier for me and I was right about the stairs.'

[All that happened on Saturday, as of now, it's Monday, I graduate on Thursday]

So, earlier today, my grandma called my mom to confirm plans and just generally talk to her daughter like a good mom should. Apparently, she mentioned that she was getting a hotel room because I asked her to. My mom got super mad at me and yelled at me for being disrespectful. 

So now I'm confused. I don't think I did anything wrong, but my mom is mad at me. So AITA?

Tl;dr I asked my grandma to stay in a hotel instead of sleeping in my room before my graduation because I have lots of sleep issues and now my mom is mad at me. 

Edit to add: My mom is a wonderful human being that I can't imagine living without. I love her to the moon and back. This isn't a normal thing, it's very specific to this incident. She's usually very good with recognizing and accommodating my needs, even when I can't voice them properly. She's taken care of me during meltdowns, calmed me down from midnight panic attacks, gotten me out of bed when I felt like I couldn't, she's literally making me a cookbook so I don't forget how to make certain things that she makes.

My ex and I were never married. My ex and I have both moved to new homes and have gotten married (separately) since our split and my daughter stays with each parent 50/50, one week on, one week off. My daughter will start 4th grade next school year.

I've listed the house that My Daughter, ex and I lived in before the split for sale (going forward I'll refer to the house as my 'old house'), as maintaining the second property as a rental has become financially untenable. The school district allows families to apply for open enrollment to attend a school whose district they do not live in, but it is never a guarantee that they will be approved.

Last year I had a discussion with my ex about my daughter's school, because I was moving to a new home with my wife. We agreed then that we did not want to move my daughter, so she would remain registered under my original home address.

My ex reached out and asked me how we were going to keep our daughter in her school. I explained that I intended to use my neighbors address so that my daughter could stay at the school uninterrupted. This is the only aspect of her life that has been consistent since my ex and I split (new houses, new step-parents, etc.). The neighbor in question has also allowed another family to use his address, so that their son could stay at the same school after their lease was terminated abruptly (this is a friend of my daughter at school, my ex and I have known the family since our kids were in kindergarten).

My ex insisted that this was not acceptable, as she is an occasional substitute of the school and she was not comfortable ""lying to her employer"".  I pointed out that the stability of the school is worth a white lie; what's more, my ex and I had discussed this matter last year with some teachers and were told that the district does not regularly audit addresses. It is only in unique cases, when students have behavioral problems or persistent tardiness problems, that the district will verify the accuracy of a home address (in fact, the district has a policy of providing busing services for families who are displaced by home loss at no expense to the family in order to ensure school continuity for the student). My ex continues to insist that it is not appropriate to lie to the district in any regard, and that if the lie were found out, our daughter would be kicked out of school.

I pointed out that changing our daughter's registration address to either my or my ex's address would guarantee that our daughter would be enrolled at a different school, with only the hope that an application to open enroll her would be accepted so that she can stay at her current school. I prefer to try and keep her in her current school by lying to the district and never risking the denial of an open enrollment request.

149,1cwyc2b,AITA for later choosing not to go to prom with my coworker?,"To start, I was an 18 year old male senior in high school. At the time worked at a well know franchise in my city and I absolutely hated it. I worked there for about 2 years before I began working with this girl who was a junior in high school at the time. We will call her Maria. Maria was a very sweet, funny and kind person to work with and I soon began developing a crush on her.

A few months go by and I decide to ask Maria out to my prom, and she said yes immediately. I was super excited and couldn’t wait and decided to go all out, organizing a rental sports car from my dads work friend and buying a very nice suit, along with a prom gift for Maria. 

Word got around that I liked her and she soon realized herself, so she had a talk with me and explained how she only wanted to be friends. I was super understanding with her and she greatly appreciated this. Although to say I was super devastated and heartbroken was an understatement. Nonetheless I tried moving on while still being friends with Maria for the sake of my prom and my working situation. A few more months go by and Maria grew very distant with me, avoiding group hangouts where I was around and she started talking to me less and less. I was very upset by this because at this point I felt like I was being used for my prom. I brought my feelings up to Maria and she was very upset and we got into an argument that left us both devastated.

For three days we didn’t talk until she decided to reach out so we could talk about it. We ultimately decided that it was best for her and myself to go our own ways, so I decided that I would take someone else even though she already had her dress bought. I offered to pay her back for it but she refused. She told me the reason she never hung out with me was not to lead me on, and she was okay with me going with someone else, but apart of me thinks she was only saying this because she felt bad about what happened.

When I went back to school, just about every girl heard what happened and decided to tear me a new one. Our school was fairly small with no more then 300 students and Maria was quit popular so word got around quickly. People in my school felt like I dropped her for no reason, even though Maria herself did not think this. A lot of her friends were very mad about what happened, and we’re not shy on telling me how they felt.

In the end, I went to prom with my childhood best friend and had a good time. I still took the sports car, and kept the fancy suit. Maria ended up going with another guy in my class and shortly afterwards I moved away.

Looking back on it I feel bad because of the trouble I put her and myself threw for nothing, but I don’t know if what people thought was the truth or if they just didn’t know the full story. Me and Maria rarely talk today but are still on good terms. Were my actions selfish? Was Maria really okay with not going with me?

Word got around that I liked her and she soon realized herself, so she had a talk with me and explained how she only wanted to be friends. I was super understanding with her and she greatly appreciated this. Although to say I was super devastated and heartbroken was an understatement. Nonetheless I tried moving on while still being friends with Maria for the sake of my prom and my working situation. A few more months go by and Maria grew very distant with me, avoiding group hangouts where I was around and she started talking to me less and less. I was very upset by this because at this point I felt like I was being used for my prom. I brought my feelings up to Maria and she was very upset and we got into an argument that left us both devastated.

For three days we didn’t talk until she decided to reach out so we could talk about it. We ultimately decided that it was best for her and myself to go our own ways, so I decided that I would take someone else even though she already had her dress bought. I offered to pay her back for it but she refused. She told me the reason she never hung out with me was not to lead me on, and she was okay with me going with someone else, but apart of me thinks she was only saying this because she felt bad about what happened.

When I went back to school, just about every girl heard what happened and decided to tear me a new one. Our school was fairly small with no more then 300 students and Maria was quit popular so word got around quickly. People in my school felt like I dropped her for no reason, even though Maria herself did not think this. A lot of her friends were very mad about what happened, and we’re not shy on telling me how they felt.

In the end, I went to prom with my childhood best friend and had a good time. I still took the sports car, and kept the fancy suit. Maria ended up going with another guy in my class and shortly afterwards I moved away.

Looking back on it I feel bad because of the trouble I put her and myself threw for nothing, but I don’t know if what people thought was the truth or if they just didn’t know the full story. Me and Maria rarely talk today but are still on good terms. Were my actions selfish? Was Maria really okay with not going with me?
