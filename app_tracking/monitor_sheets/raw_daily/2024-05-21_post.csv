0,1cxie4i,AITA for not inviting my aunt in law to my wedding?,"I'm relatively new to Reddit, I'm fairly certain this is how I format it.

Me (35M) and my fiance (32F) are getting married in October.

We have agreed my parents, her dad, my brother, my uncle, and my cousin will be at the wedding, we are having a small wedding with only a few non-family members. 

My uncle, (58M), has three kids, I will call them M (15M), T(21M) and B(21F).

Me and M are the closest, he's a little terror but I'm glad he's in my family. He recently came out to our family as transgender (Female to Male, I think thats right term) and no one was very surprised. He was always a tom boy, and over all never 'girlie'.

B is also trans, (Male to Female) and recently came out as well, but again, we weren't very surprised. 

B and T are twins, and were like two peas in a pod, when M was born, he joined their little group. The three of them have always been very close, and B and M came out to T first.

M is going to be flower boy, and he's going to wear a suit. T is going to be one of my grooms men, and B is going to be a brides maid.

The three of them are all matching, a detail we all find sweet.

But anyways, my uncle has a wife (58F) who is not the mother of any of the kids, they've been married for two years, and were dating seven years before.

My aunt in law will not play any part in our wedding, and will ot even be there.

She constantly dead names B and M, and is over all a jerk to M.

She is also rude toward me and my fiance, and most of our family. We have no idea what my uncle sees in her.

I'm going to have my cousin in my wedding, no matter what. Aunt In Law is mad she won't be there, but she knows exactly why.

She took M shopping for the wedding, and refused to let him get a suit, buying him dress instead. M came to me and my fiance crying at the engagement party (a few days after they went shopping) because Aunt in law wouldn't let him wear a suit, and demanded he wear a dress.

It been a few months since the party, and we have everything planned out.

My aunt is law will arive, but she won't be allowed in, my Best Man, who is my brother, will get M, T, and B into their outfits.

Aunt in law is throwing a fit over this, blowing up fiance and mine's phones, aswell as my mom and dad's.

1,1cxgx15,AITA the asshole for threatening to go to HR?,"I don’t know if it’s the pregnancy hormones or if I’m just pissed because I already can’t stand this person, but here we are. I need an outside opinion because in the office, most of our colleagues don’t want to get involved (understandable).

I’m six months pregnant. We don’t know the sex of the baby because we want to keep it a surprise. In our culture, there’s a custom where we name our babies after family or close friends who have since died. The idea is that they will gain the good qualities of the deceased with the hope they will gain an interest in who they were and, in a greater scope, our family and cultural heritage.

We want to name the baby after my grandfather, who had a Y name. We’re thinking Yosef for a boy or Yael for a girl. 

My coworker Casey thinks I’m doing my future baby a disservice. She thinks I’m an asshole for burdening my child with someone else’s name and that they should have their own name. In addition she keeps bugging me with hypotheticals like what if my child wants to change their name or if they come out as trans. The answer is, either don’t care or the chances of it happen are low that it probably might not happen.

I’ve tried to explain that we’re not naming my baby after my grandfather. They will just share the same initial. Casey doesn’t listen. 

Anyway, I’m having lunch when Casey is buggering me about my baby’s name. I tried to shut it down by threatening to go to HR for harassment. 

That shut her up for now, but my cubicle mate and a few others in the department think I’m taking it too far when HR has other problems to deal with. I also ask because Casey got really upset with me and begged me not to go to HR, which makes me think there’s more going on I don’t know.

2,1cx4p9c,AITA for telling my friend's friend that she was overstimulating my sensory disorder?,"I feel like I may have ruined a friendship, i know my friends said it wasn't my fault, but I feel like if I'd just shut up, I wouldn't have ruined it

So I have a sensory disorder and adhd, so depending on my day, literally anything can make me over stimulate myself and cry so bad to the point I'm hyperventilating

And a few days ago, me and my friends were hanging out, and one of my friends invited this girl I barely know which I'm fine with because they go way back

And I was kinda getting overwhelmed already, but I'm used to that when I'm hanging with friends, I know how to deal with it, but the girl was pushing my limits

She was sitting next to me on the couch, and she kept getting very close to me while claiming she had no room (she had room) to the point I was pushed against the arm rest because I didn't want anyone touching me, especially when I'm already overwhelmed, and everyone knows this, that's why they try to keep a distance when I seem overwhelmed

A few of my friends did try to explain to her that I don't like being touched by people I don't really know, or when I'm overwhelmed, but she didn't really listen and I just told them it's fine and moved to the floor, which I like sitting at better anyways

Now I don't know if she had personal beef with me or if she just didnt realize her actions, but for some reason she seemed like she was doing certain things just to mess with me

Later she was eating pizza and she was chewing so loudly with her mouth wide open and it was nearly sending me to tears because of the noise and the fact that I could see her chewing the food that fell out of her mouth, and she would not stop, but once again I just tried to ignore her because she's new and doesn't know about my disorders

Now after a bunch of back and forth of her doing things that messed with me and was starting to make me cry, I explained in detail that I have adhd and a sensory disorder so if she could just tone herself down and not do certain things, thatd be find, but she said no and told me I was to depressed to have adhd, which made my friends mad

My friends started arguing with the girl, including her friend that invited her, who argued with her the most, the girl said that people with actual adhd are always happy while I looked like an emo tr*nny who was trying to hard which really, really sent my friends off (I'm ftm trans btw)

I love my friends for coming to my aid, but I feel selfish, and snobby for telling the girl to stop, and it got worse when the girl's friend fully ended their relationship

I know my friend was really good friends with the girl and I feel so bad, i know she said it was fine and she doesn't want to be friends with someone who disrespects her friends, but I just feel like this could have been avoided and that it's just disorders, I should be able to get over a little noise and a few touches

We met super young and just had a bond. For some background my ex friend who I'll call B is chronically online. They revolve their whole life around the internet and the people they meet. I didn't have a problem with this until recently. B is transgender FtM and has dozens of Facebook accounts where they tend to post soft core 🌽 of themselves. Awhile back they made a post asking people who wanted to be hidden from their content. I told them I had their accounts unfollowed due to issues with Facebooks notifications not turning off for me. I'd like to mention I have every single person on my account unfollowed for this same reason. Family, friends, pages etc. A few people said my response was rude and hateful. I explained why I said what I said but it still wasn't enough. A few hours later my comment was removed. Several days go by and I noticed while looking for Bs account to message them that I couldn't find it nor could I locate about 22 other individuals. I panicked and checked my block list and saw all 23 people had been randomly blocked. While in the middle of unblocking people my account suddenly signed out. I begin freaking out and tried to contact B another way but I was removed on everything. Upon looking at my email I found that my FB had been reported 176 times. I contacted support and they provided me what had been reported and why. When I asked why had people been blocked Fb support claimed it was similar to when I report someone and can block them but the opposite as well as something they took into their hands until they could investigate the claims made against me. I tried contacting Bs family and tried to explain to them what had happened but they didn't seem to care. 

Several weeks go by and I still haven't gotten my account back but I started getting messages from people I didn't know claiming to be friends with B. These messages ranged from threats of doxing, calling CPS, getting my partner involved, and most recently to off myself. I was called transphobic for not wanting to support Bs *orn stuff. The list goes on. I kept ignoring and blocking people but it's just gotten the point I can't anymore. I don't wanna believe B knows this is happening but any attempt to reach them is ignored or met with hostility from others. My only opinion is to reach out to Bs parents again and explain to them what's been going on so that maybe B will contact me and I can stop all of this.

4,1cwyazs,AITA for telling my husband he ruined my birthday ,"Today is my (F) 35th birthday. In general I don’t love my birthday because growing up my parents would always throw us parties and fight and complain about how expensive they were, etc. So basically I feel like celebrating myself is a burden. Anyway, I’ve been happier to celebrate it these past few years because I’m trying hard to allow myself to. 

I am married and have two kids (5, 9). Four days ago I had surgery to remove a 9cm endometrioma from my ovary. Doctor was supposed to also remove my ovary but couldn’t because it’s fused to my bowels and abdominal wall. I feel pretty exhausted, still have some pain, still mentally dealing with knowing there’s more to come. I also recently lost my job because the hospital system I worked for closed its mental health clinic. Basically I could really use a win. (Thankfully have another job lined up, just waiting to fully recover to start!)

Anyway, my husband has to take the kids to school this week despite me being unemployed because I can’t lift our five year old if necessary and I’m still iffy on driving. This morning I woke up to him fighting with her because she wanted me to get her ready and she was refusing to go to school.  That’s a whole other topic but I came downstairs to diffuse the situation. Was downstairs for a half an hour- No one wished me a happy birthday. Ultimately my daughter wouldn’t get ready and my husband decided it was easier to let her stay home with me and call her out of school than put forth the effort to get her ready and to school because I could just deal with her. I was fucking PISSED. 

I am exhausted. I am in pain. I need to rest. Can’t do that with a five year old at home. I just wanted to read, nap, lay out, all of which is what I should be doing to recover. Plus I just wanted to have a day of peace to myself on my birthday after all of the shit life has thrown at me lately. 

His attitude got even worse tonight and I told him I was sick of it and I was disappointed he ruined my birthday. He didn’t take that well.  AITA for being pissed he left her home, continued to be negative (like every word that came out of his mouth was a complaint), and telling him he ruined my day?

EDIT: HIS attitude lead HIM to yell at and be just overall unpleasant to our kids. All morning. All evening. I understand things are stressful but that’s why we have frustration tolerance. 

Not blaming him for job loss, not blaming him for surgery. I am also aware he is impacted by these things, especially considering I am the primary breadwinner and make ~30% more money than he does. It’s stressful for both of us for sure. 

He also usually gets them ready for and takes them to school two days a week when I’m working so this is nothing new to him. Some mornings are still rough for either of us. This would actually have been his normal day to take them and never once has he allowed her to just stay home. So because I was home it was decided she could “just stay with me” rather than manage her behavior. Her staying home meant I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t take pain medication, had to manage meals (something I’m otherwise obviously capable of doing but still struggling to do even for myself at this point because I’m so tired and still in a lot of pain) and entertainment all while also trying to not positively reinforce her staying home (which was already done when she was allowed to stay home).

6,1cwy4rc,WIBTA For dropping out of my friends Disney cruise wedding?,"So I (19F) have been invited to my friends (20F and 20M) wedding, which is supposed to happen in September. Of course hearing the news of the wedding, I was ecstatic! The news of the wedding being on a Disney cruise was also exciting.

I accepted the invite immediately, as I am close with the two (in fact I am one of the bridesmaids.) Since the news of the wedding being on a cruise happened back in November, I thought saving would be no problem. 

I work part time, and I quit my old job back in December, and due to unforeseen circumstances I have made much less money than I was before. 

Throughout the months the bride and groom have been urging for the payments more and more. They are aware of my financial situation and have offered solutions, such as a payment plan and an extension, even going so far to allow me to pay back after the wedding. 

Recently however, as the date draws near and my search for a better paying job grows bleak, I am starting to realize that I may not be able to afford to attend the wedding. My friend also recently dropped out of the wedding which I’ve been informed that they are rather upset, because that means they have to pay more money. They also promised her that she could pay after the wedding which they are now claiming was a misunderstanding, which I can confirm was not as I was there when they said that. The brides mom even texted my mom to help pay for me after I mention I wouldn’t be able to afford a monthly payment, even after I mentioned I was going to be getting more work soon and would most likely to be able to pay her in full.

The brides mom even texted my mom to help pay for me after I mention I wouldn’t be able to afford a monthly payment, even after I mentioned I was going to be getting more work soon and would most likely to be able to pay her in full.

The due date is June 1, which is where I may be the asshole, since it is very last minute and they would have to pay me back any money I’ve given them. 

So WIBTA to drop out of my friends wedding last minute?",1.0,0.103861704,0,0
7,1cwy01n,AITA taking care of my sister's cat and not dropping off her keys afterwards ,"I (29F) was asked(TOLD) by my sister (23F) to take care of her cat Saturday-Monday. She left on Friday. I've done it before and I usually stop by once a day and give him food. Mondays are my busiest and I wasn't able to go. I work until 5. By the time I ate, showered, and relaxed a little, it was already 6:30. I told her I probably wasn't gonna be able to go, I also thought it would be fine since she was gonna get there at 8:30. Anyway, she got mad and demanded I drop off her keys and told me that was ""disgusting behavior"" for letting her cat starve. I told her that I probably wasn't gonna leave my home but that she could come pick up the keys. She then got mad called me lazy, disgusting, etc. I take full responsibility for not feeding the cat today after I said I would. When I took care of the cat before I didn't have a job, I didn't anticipate how busy, overwhelmed, and exhausted I'd be adding his feeding to my workday schedule. 🥴
AITA for not feeding him today (Monday)? AITA for not dropping of the keys?

EDIT: 
INFO
Firstly, I decided not to go because she would've been home around the time I was gonna be able to go. If she were to come back say Tuesday, I would've gone over around 7-8, which is when I was probably gonna be ready to leave the house. That's why I thought it wasn't a big deal not to go.
Secondly, this cat used to live at my house. He knows our pets and is quite comfortable here. I've offered in the past that she bring the cat over here so he's not alone and it would be easier to take care of him. She just flat out refuses.
Finally, I really was looking for more opinions on the key situation. In my mind, the cat situation was never the primary issue since he was going to be fed no matter what. I was seeking clarity over whose responsibility it was to pick up/drop off the keys.

She pays for pretty much everything (which she said she was totally fine with before I moved in with her), I do have a part time job and contribute but it's not a lot. So I try to do most of the cleaning and chores and stuff.

Anyways I started dating this girl I met in class (f21) and after meeting her my sister was not a fan. She's never really approved of any of my girlfriends I've ever had (which really sucks since I do care a lot about her opinion and I want her to get along with whoever I'm dating). My sister REALLY doesn't like this girl though, and I have no idea why... but this past weekend she (my gf) was going to pick me up and we were gonna go out for dinner and go to some bars after.

My sister saw me starting to get ready and stuff, and she asked me where I was going. I told her the truth and she got really pissed off at me. I told her I wasn't gonna try to drink at the bars (since I have a fake ID and she knows that) but that we were just going to hang out with some other people we knew. But she didn't care, and then told me to text my gf and tell her that the plans are off, since I wasn't going anywhere. 

I hate arguing with her and I always try to listen to her and show her a lot of respect, but I was mad and said that wasn't fair, and that she shouldn't be controlling me like that and that I should have the right to go out if I wanted to. She just got even more angry, and said that she's making me stay in because she knows what's best for me and that she is only looking out for me.

Then she took it a step further and said that she strongly suggests I break things off with this girl (we've only been dating for a few weeks) and she said that she's bad news and I just can't see it. But I feel like that's what she always says. But to be fair she has been right in the past.

Finally I just gave in (since I didn't feel there was any way I was gonna change her mind), texted my gf that I wasn't feeling well and needed to cancel our date (which I hated doing since I was lying 😞 but I was too embarrassed to tell her the real reason), and I stayed in my room listening to music pretty much the whole night.

My wife comes from a blended family where she splits major holidays between both parents (ex. Christmas, Thanksgiving) although neither parent lives in the same city. She is the youngest of her father’s kids. Her older sister has an unhealthy relationship with her. It's a mixture of attachment/bullying in my opinion. A major part of the relationship is my wife being her “little sister” although they are less than a year apart. 

Every holiday her sister blows her up badgering her on when she will get to her dad’s. Although the routine has been the same the entirety of our relationship. We start at her mom’s and eventually migrate to her dad’s in the second half of the day. This past thanksgiving at her dad’s was a potluck format for which my wife was responsible for getting the drinks. Knowing she splits the holidays she tasked another family member also responsible for drinks to get enough for which she paid her. Like clockwork on the morning of thanksgiving her sister starts her routine and my wife told her more or less “I took care of the drinks but I expected this either way”. Fast forward to our arrival at her dad’s and her sister did not say a word to either one of us for the duration of our stay which was overnight and well into the following day. They did not speak for months as my wife had finally decided to stand up for herself as she had done nothing wrong. 

Her sister has a birthday tripped planned in the summer that started the planning process well before thanksgiving. Around March she started weaseling her way back in with my wife as though nothing happened. And their relationship started to rekindle as though nothing happened at all. We attended an event in support of another family member which her sister also attended in March. Her sister proceeded to continue to not speak to me but did converse with my wife. 

Fast forward to Saturday in which we attended a birthday dinner for my wife’s step mom and her sister’s trend of not speaking to me continued. The following day at brunch I let my wife know that I don’t intend to be around her dad’s side of the family in the near future as the disrespect had finally gotten to me. I had to drop the conversation because I knew it was one we could not continue without her crying which she had started to do.

I’m at a loss because asking your spouse to stand-up for you when you have done nothing wrong doesn’t seem like a tall ask. I don’t let my own sisters disrespect me in this manner so it is becoming tough on me. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for telling my wife I don't want to be around her sister? **Am I the asshole for feeling I'm deserved an apology from my sister-in-law and telling my wife I don't intend to be around her sister any longer?

16,1cwx5fc,AITA for telling my best friend I don’t want to third wheel anymore?,"I (23m) recently told my best friend (25m) that I didn’t want to be the third wheel every time we hang out. Little bit of backstory, we have been friends for going on three years at this point but since his last relationship, everything we do and every conversation we have must include his gf. This was never an issue before until he got into this relationship in January of last year. She immediately moved in and wanted to read all of our texts, all phone calls had to be on speaker, and I couldn’t be around him without her present. She didn’t like how much he divided his attention between her and his friends, especially me. If we hung out (which we used to do every day), we could only do what she wanted because she would throw a fit and want to go home if we wanted to do anything different. I ended up on bad terms with her due to us continuing to hang out and talk even though she told him he needed to “get rid of his social life” for her to be happy. Eventually she started rumors within his family and with our friends that led to us not speaking anymore. They have since broken up and things had went back to normal with us. 
We ended up moving in together not too long ago for financial reasons and things were going well. He’s started dating again and the issue has came back up. We’ve been arguing because according to him, I don’t talk to his gf enough or go out with them enough. I try to be friendly but we have nothing in common so we don’t normally have full conversations. The biggest argument has been if I ask to hang out when she isn’t here. She hasn’t moved in but stays here most nights. Lives an hour and a half away. When I ask him to go out to eat or catch him out of his room and just try to hang out in the living room on nights she isn’t here, we end up arguing because I didn’t go out to eat with them when she was here or would leave the room when they got too touchy. We talked last night and I tried to explain my POV. I don’t always want to third wheel with them. I shouldn’t have to wait for a day that she’s here to ask something as simple as going to Walmart with me. I thought giving them time to go out by themselves when she is here would be appreciated. It didn’t go over well and now he’s saying it’s weird that I ask him to do things when she isn’t here. She also doesn’t like it. He’s threatening to move out because of it. 
For context, yes I do go out with them sometimes, just not all the time. I wasn’t raised to see dudes hanging out as weird but it’s weird to him if he has a gf and we do anything without her present.

18,1cwx472,AITA for raising my (27F) voice to my partner (23M),"To begin with, I am extremely crippled by my action. I am here because my guilt is eating me up and I know I'm a terrible person. However, I just need to know if it's a complex situation and if I should give more grace to myself. For context, I am recently engaged and will get married next year to my kind partner. 

I am facing problems with my dad as he separated from my mom a few years ago. My father is making it harder for me to plan the marriage. I was stressed, and I vented to my partner. Instead of supporting me emotionally, my partner insinuated that perhaps it was a sign from the gods that our marriage was not blessed. He's thinking that there's somebody better for me out there. My partner is a very sensitive person compared to me. I'm pragmatic, but I fear it makes me tone-deaf and unempathetic in this situation. 

Therefore, I know he said those things to me because he internalised my problems with my dad, but it hurt me really bad. I asked him to stop talking, fearing it would hurt me more, and he kept talking over me. Out of frustration, I accidentally raised my voice and said, ""Goodness, stop!"" I was stunned by it and silenced myself afterwards. I called him and apologised properly, but I know he needs to heal from what I've done. I've messed up big time by hurting him, and trust me, I am so disappointed in myself. I used to believe that I was a calm, rational and logical person. I would not even hurt a fly, but I raised my voice at my partner, the person I love the most. Why am I a walking paradox? 

Before he went to sleep, after I apologised earlier, he texted me about how much I had hurt him and he never expected it to come from me. He asked me to stop discussing this issue as he doesn't want to remember this horrible day anymore. I usually would not communicate my side of the story as I don't want to make the situation worse, but before getting ready to work, I wrote him long messages explaining that I was feeling unheard and I accidentally raised my voice to ask him to listen. I was not trying to gaslight him, but I explained his actions that led me to it. I tried telling myself that communication is essential and I can speak about my feelings, but I am so scared.

fast forward to recently, i have taken off a couple days before my birthday this year to celebrate and was hoping he could come celebrate too. he’s able to come and is going to be done with work by then but says he cannot because he needs to be home for father’s day. all of my birthday celebrations in which id love for all my loved ones to be there will be jun 14-16 but he’s adamant on not coming because of father’s day & says he’ll make it up after. although i appreciate his willingness to make it up after, i can’t help but feel hurt once again because he’s not able to adjust or sacrifice a little bit of his family time (he lives w his parents) in order to celebrate w me on my day. am i being selfish or emotionally immature? the only reason i expect this level of dedication is because id do the same for him. please let me know if this is childish or unreasonable thank you.

21,1cwwpxz,AITA for nitpicking about my friend’s novel? ,"My friend recently wrote a novel, and asked me to read and critique it, both in terms of grammar mistakes as well as plot points/writing.

One critique I had was that one character is 5’5, yet is described as pocket-sized, tiny, short, etc numerous times throughout the plot. The character in question is a woman, and for a woman, I don’t think 5’5 is short enough to warrant being called tiny, it’s not even particularly short for a woman. So I stated she should either change the character’s height or the description that she’s particularly short.

According to my mom, my sister and her boyfriend James (22M) were talking and my sister told him that she would not play softball next year but then later told my mom that she would think about maybe playing again. I suppose my mom relayed this to James when they were having a text conversation because my parents will be friends with mine and my sister's SO's and talk to them regularly.

She did not see the text until after the game was over and they won, and she started bawling. Fast forward a day or two and I call my sister to try and comfort her and as I was talking to her, she continually blamed herself, saying that James did nothing wrong and that she had lied to him. I tried consoling her saying that changing her mind is not the same as outright lying, and I called him an asshat. She stated that she had never said she would even consider continuing to play ball and always said she would not play after two years (she just finished her second year). Fast forward another two days and she calls me asking me to apologize to him for calling him an asshat if for nothing more than the understanding that he had dumped her in the middle of a championship game over text, and he had heard me call him that because he had been with her when I first called. She was crying and saying that he did nothing wrong and she had been lying to him the whole time. I initially refused to apologize for calling him an asshat, I will admit and apologize for making assumptions solely from the story my mom told me. She still insists that I apologize for the 'asshat' remark and when I told her no, she said ""fine then ruin my relationship"".

She did not see the text until after the game was over and they won, and she started bawling. Fast forward a day or two and I call my sister to try and comfort her and as I was talking to her, she continually blamed herself, saying that James did nothing wrong and that she had lied to him. I tried consoling her saying that changing her mind is not the same as outright lying, and I called him an asshat. She stated that she had never said she would even consider continuing to play ball and always said she would not play after two years (she just finished her second year). Fast forward another two days and she calls me asking me to apologize to him for calling him an asshat if for nothing more than the understanding that he had dumped her in the middle of a championship game over text, and he had heard me call him that because he had been with her when I first called. She was crying and saying that he did nothing wrong and she had been lying to him the whole time. I initially refused to apologize for calling him an asshat, I will admit and apologize for making assumptions solely from the story my mom told me. She still insists that I apologize for the 'asshat' remark and when I told her no, she said ""fine then ruin my relationship"". I said I would talk to him when I see him in person this weekend as I am flying home for my mom's birthday. I'm not sure whether he did break up with her or not or if they got back together. I still refuse to apologize for calling him an asshat. Am I the Asshole?",0.0,1.0016465,1,0
24,1cww8x0,AITA for not attending my best friend’s grandfather’s funeral?,"
My best friend of over 10 years grandfather recently passed away. I gave my condolences to her and messaged her my support. She initially responded, but then just stopped after telling us (our friend group) that she wasn’t okay. To my understanding, we all reached out separately to her after her message. None of us got a response from her, she went ghost. The friend group talked separately about ways to support her and we discussed attending the funeral, but we hadn’t heard anything from her and it felt intrusive to keep texting her. We all live in different states and her grandparents live in a different state than her. To be fair, I didn’t ask her for funeral details, but at the time it did feel intrusive to keep reaching out to her. I looked at social media and tried to google any details but didn’t find anything. 

By the time I saw the obituary online, it was the day of the funeral and too late to attend. I felt awful. Maybe a few days after the fact, she sends up a long text basically saying that she’s mad we didn’t attend the funeral and a small part of her thought we would surprise her there. That was the first time we heard from her. It’s been super weird since then. Later we had a conversation and she was very upset about all the ways life had gone wrong, I didn’t know that was how she felt as it’s hard to get information from her. I feel as though she is not acknowledging that she didn’t respond to any of us or ask us attend the funeral.  The conversation we had went left because it seemed like everything I said only upset her more. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-21,"AITA for not attending my best friend’s grandfather’s funeral?

26,1cwvh8d,AITA for wanting to move out?,"Hello,

I'm 21F and I just graduated last Thursday, with a job lined up starting in a month. I currently live with my mother who is deaf and mute. It's just us two because I lost my dad in January.

I've always been wanting to move out because of many reasons: Needing independency, having a life of my own, but also I just can't stay here anymore. My mom can lash out verbally on me about things that I didn't cause, do, or can't control, and it's been hurtful but I'm always pressured to ""understand"" because that's the way that she is. For the past 8 years I've always gotten angry treatment from her and I've grown to be insecure, scared, and not confident in myself. I'm also pressured to almost be her caregiver in a way that I always translate for her, work on her appointments and papers for her, etc. I helped her with getting life insurance, doing taxes, doctor appointments, and more. There's even been times that I skipped school and work for her because I had no choice. And not once, did she thank me for what I've been doing. 

With that being said, I told one of my aunts that I wanted to move out. I thought she would understand. Plus it was just an idea that I wanted to express so that they're not too surprised. But what was first a ""message to express myself and let you know"" turned into an argument. I first expressed myself neutrally, told them I'll just be in the same town so I will still support my mom financially and help out with the bills. Told them I wanted to be more independent because I still depend on my mom nowadays on many things. Moving out will force me to figure things out on my own- which is what I want to do.

But my aunt didn't respond very well. For example, I was told things like ""Now that you graduated you want to escape from your mom because you think she's toxic and she's unhealthy for you and she's a burden to you"", ""I thought you're grown now and matured, and I thought you'll be understanding your mom because you studied psychology but you're only concerned about validating your own feelings and goals, and being away from your mom"", ""I trusted you that you'll be taking care of you mom but maybe they're right, you shouldn't be trusted you'll just leave your mom"", ""It's just you and your mom now, she just lost your dad and she has a disability and you're gonna leave her?"" and many more that I'm just exploding at this point but also wondering if I was in the wrong.

AITA for wanting to move out at all? Considering that my mom is a widow, has a disability, needs help with many things.

  
TLDR; 21F fresh college graduate wanting to move out in 6 months-1 year, family upset because I'll be leaving my mom alone who is a widow and has deafness, is mute. Argument goes wrong and I came out of it feeling wrong and guilty, family talked about how I owe my mom and helping her shows respect and gratitude.

27,1cwv7or,AITA Pregnant and husband stressed,"I am 37 weeks pregnant with our second child. First kid is a wild, active, precocious, fairly difficult (I think so anyway) 17 month old boy. Lately I have been feeling slower and sicker just as the pregnancy nears the end, tons of uncomfortable false contractions that are caused by me handling our toddler mostly, so I haven’t been contributing as much as usual. For example, husband now gets up with our toddler in the mornings, does most of the grocery shopping and makes more meals than I do and he is visibly stressed out but I am physically exhausted and just not as able bodied as normal. Today I was at work (I’m a SpEd teacher so on my feet a lot) and felt like I was going to pass out (seeing stars, starting to sweat, feeling faint) and I stepped outside and sat down and tried to keep myself from fading out. I was mostly just embarrassed but also a bit panicked and my thinking was clouded. I called my husband who is a nurse practitioner at an urgent care and was at work, and just gave him a brief run down and said I wasn’t feeling great. I wasn’t looking for him leave work or anything to pick me up, I was mostly just feeling sick and uncomfortable and scared and wanted some empathy and a calming presence and for someone to keep me distracted so I wouldn’t black out. 

My husband was busy at work and annoyed that I called, he yelled that he’s so fucking tired of me being sick, that he can’t wait for this all to be over with, and said with an attitude “idk what you want me to do” then started explaining how he had 40 patients in the waiting room and 3 ambulances waiting outside work etc. I hung up the phone and he never called or texted the rest of the day.

Work is over, he’s ignoring me and hasn’t acknowledged his behavior from earlier or said thanks for making dinner tonight etc. I just feel down about myself thinking I must be a burden for bothering him when I feel like I need support.

This isn’t the first time this has happened or that I’ve addressed that I’d like more compassion in times where I feel sick, and he just says he’s too burned out from work to show me any and I have to deal with it. 

AMITA for calling him during work today in a time of emotional need? 

Update: I confronted him and tried to be as empathetic as possible about how hard he works and how thankful I am that he has taken on extra parenting tasks but that he still hurt my feelings with the caustic response earlier, and he doubled down on how I don’t understand how difficult his job is compared to mine and how I don’t make enough money for the family and he can’t hold my hand through every time I feel sick or scared and that he’s not excited anymore to bring a new baby into the world in a few weeks. Also said that I’m using pregnancy as an excuse to not be as hard working as I could be. Just going to hope for a better day tomorrow.

My dad (66M) has run a roof plumbing business for 30 years. For the first 24 years, it was just him and occasionally an offsider during busy periods. I joined my dad six years ago while figuring out my next move and then decided to commit to the business. Before joining, I was a sport management grad and traveled the world.

Since joining the business, we’ve pivoted from just roof construction to roof maintenance and cleaning. We've grown from just my dad and me to over 25 employees. I love my dad and he was a good tradie, but he wasn’t focused on the business side of things. Before, he was making a good living for just himself, but since I joined, we’ve grown and become a lot more professional. This year, we’re targeting our first double-digit million revenue. Our profits are low because we’re focused on growth.

I never thought of the inheritance stage because my sisters and BIL are accountants, engineers, or lawyers who are very white-collar workers and wanted no part of the business. My sister (33F), an accountant, even told us we had to use another accountant because she didn’t have time to help with our taxes.

Unbeknownst to me, my dad has been telling my sister and BIL about our revenue target for this fiscal year. She is now interested in coming in as Managing Director to help professionalize the business. I was ambushed with this news at dinner. I laughed and was speechless. It turned into a nasty argument where I felt I was being patronized and told I couldn’t do what I’ve done in the last six years. She started saying our profits are too low for our revenue and we need to be addressing all these issues. She has never set foot in our warehouse.

I know this was my dad’s business, but to be honest, he was just a sole trader before I came. I changed our business model, made us a website, worked with an agency to launch our marketing campaigns, and was on the tools. When we moved from sole trader to a company, we issued two shares and each have one. I guess it was never a family business when we were struggling, but now that we’re successful, it’s a family business. I've been arguing with my dad, mum, and sisters.

31,1cwuyot,AITAH for telling my mom she is part of the reason my son won't be potty trained.,"Me and my kids are staying with my mom temporarily, I have a 4 year old son who showed very little interest in using the bathroom other then in a pull up. He starts kindergarten next year and won't be able to attend unless he is fully potty trained, which is understandable. So I made the decision to not put a pull up on him during the day, and only use one at night which also means I'm no longer buying the boxes just small packs, which is a savings. When I had told my mom my plan she did not object to it but just said ok. She does watch him while I work but anytime she takes him out she puts a pull up on him instead of him telling her he has to go to the bathroom. When I take him out I do not put one on him and he does just fine without. I do know this is not her responsibility to potty train him but it has gotten to the point he screams for a pull up. Quite frankly I am tired of buying them as they are extremely expensive, even the cheapest ones I can find. 





I had posted something to specify some things in the comments so I'm just going to post it here and add some things...
So to specify some things, I did not just start potty training him I introduced him to the potty at 1 I bought him his own potty to get him use to sitting on it. At 2 was when I started to potty train full time with him wearing pull ups a timer set for every 30 mins and I would have him sit on it, and he hated it, would sit there crying and screaming only actually going in it a few times. So yes I did back off a little bit I didn't want to traumatize him. 

While I don't pay her directly for babysitting I do pay for the groceries, do the grocery shopping, put gas in her car and pay whatever bills she wants me to pay for that month, I also do all the cleaning. Yes I know I should be paying some bills since me and my kids do live there i do not have a problem with that. 

I do have other kids but they are not younger they are older, he is the youngest. I did not have any problems with them potty training so this is a first for me.

Me and their father are not together, he is not able to watch him while I work, for various reasons.

I have tried to find other childcare, there is a wait list which he is on several of them. I did not just expect my mom to watch him just because I am staying there.",Asshole,2024-05-21,"AITAH for telling my mom she is part of the reason my son won't be potty trained. Me and my kids are staying with my mom temporarily, I have a 4 year old son who showed very little interest in using the bathroom other then in a pull up. He starts kindergarten next year and won't be able to attend unless he is fully potty trained, which is understandable. So I made the decision to not put a pull up on him during the day, and only use one at night which also means I'm no longer buying the boxes just small packs, which is a savings. When I had told my mom my plan she did not object to it but just said ok. She does watch him while I work but anytime she takes him out she puts a pull up on him instead of him telling her he has to go to the bathroom. When I take him out I do not put one on him and he does just fine without. I do know this is not her responsibility to potty train him but it has gotten to the point he screams for a pull up. Quite frankly I am tired of buying them as they are extremely expensive, even the cheapest ones I can find.

33,1cwupdp,AITA for asking my bf to appreciate things I do for him ,"Hi, myself 24f and bf 26m. Been together for almost 4 years but currently going through a rocky patch. 
It’s such a minor thing but is bugging me. My bf works long hours. He stayed at my house last night, I woke up an hour before him this morning at 5am to make him his lunch because he always says he doesn’t eat enough. It consisted of a meal, snack and a dessert but it was all homemade. 

All day he didn’t bother sending anything to acknowledge it until I promted to say ‘hope you liked your lunch’ to which he responded ‘yah it was lovely thank you’. 

It’d been bugging me so I sent a text in the evening saying 
‘it would be quite nice to get a message when you eat stuff that I make u, especially when I put a bit of thought and care into it ‘.  
Him - ‘Don’t start making this hard again’. 
Me - ‘I’m just telling u how I feel ‘. 
Him - ‘Well il tell you how I feel. Tired and over worked I’m sorry I didn’t text you but I haven’t exactly not been busy all day I don’t just sit on my arse and play on my phone I’ve been pricing jobs up all night’. 
Me - ‘I also made u breakfast last week and you never said anything’. 
Him - ‘I’m not coming down again if you’re just going to make me feel guilty’. 
Me - ‘when u sit and eat your food would be nice to know that u thought about me’. 
Him - ‘I eat my food and go back to work I don’t get 5 minutes to my self’. 
Me - ‘ ok sorry ‘. 
Him - ‘Speak to you tomorrow too much this is ‘. 
Me - ‘wasn’t asking for much. just some ✨appreciation ✨. night’. 
Him - Good night. 

AITA? Am I supposed to be more understanding to him? From my pov I thought I communicated my thoughts quite well but would like some external thoughts. I love making him lunch and breakfast but it’s minor things like this that put me off and I don’t think I’m being unreasonable 
He also said he’s not playing on his phone but around lunchtime he liked my Instagram post 🤷🏽‍♀️. I’m trying not to nitpick and mention these things but it just feels like he doesn’t care.

34,1cwuo6i,AITA for planning a second vacation with other part of family?,"My immediate family(husband and kids) and I are going to the mountains this summer. I've been before, its nice. But my favorite vacation place is and always will be a small beach town my parents took us to every year when I was growing up. It's been 3 years since Ive been able to go. My parents have taken my kids, and we have gone to a different beach a couple times, but it's not the same for me.

We decided to go to the mountains this year because my husband and oldest child are both tired of beach trips. I get it, but this year I've been really itching to go. I discussed it with my husband and we agreed I would ask my parents if they were interested in going. I can't afford to take all the kids on 2 vacations, plus my dad will be recovering from surgery and had already said he couldn't take the kids on a vacation this summer, so it will just be me and my parents.

We have invited my siblings, my 2 brothers can't come, and my bil(sisters husband) cant come. My sister hasnt made up her mind yet. My sister is upset at the whole situation. I'm the youngest, and the only one with kids so far, and she has felt like our parents favor me. She is upset our parents agreed so easily to a kid free vacation, she says they would never agree to that with her. Our parents say she has never invited them on a kid free vacation. 

I suspect she attempted to organize trips and never specified her wish for kid free, and my parents wanted to take my kids. They are very ""everything is more fun with kids"" type. I suspect this time is easy for them because my dad wouldn't be able to handle kids this summer plus my kids are getting a really fun vacation already, so they don't feel like the kids will miss out.

My sister says me planning 2 vacations this way is an AH move, since I'm leaving my kids out of it, and highlighting how much our parents favor me. I wont deny that I am closer with our parents, and my kids are a big part of that, but I'm also the only one of us siblings who has always been willing to meet them half way, or go all the way, to spend time with them, even when spending time together meant driving over 12 hours one way. Our mom in particular is very anal about everything being as fair as possible, so I don't think there is that much favoritism, aside from grandparents wanting to spend a lot of time with grandkids. For what its worth, they have done several things with her and her husband without my kids or I, its not a situation where she only gets to spend time with them if my kids are involved.

35,1cwuhsm,AITA? I ruined a couple’s coffee date by bringing my dog around.,"I (M38) went to a coffee shop with my wife (F38) and dog (M1). My wife went in to order the coffee while I stayed outside with our dog because dogs are not allowed (edited:) inside. The outdoor seating area was small, with two tables that had two chairs each. At one of the tables was a couple in their late 50s or early 60s who had a small dog with them. 

As I walked closer, their dog was barking and growling at my dog. My dog is a Bernese Mountain Dog, tired from his walk, so he remained calm and did not react to the other dog. Truthfully, I figured that the dog would probably keep reacting this way, and I sat down at the table next to them.

Their dog continued barking at my dog, leading the man to give me a loud and sarcastic “thanks.” I pointed out to him that my dog was behaving, and they are not any other options. The conversation ended with him calling me an asshole, The conversation ended with him calling me an asshole and leaving. As they were leaving, my wife comes out of the shop with our coffee. She asked me what happened and I told her that I was dealing with entitled boomers. I said this loud enough to make sure that our conversation was no as they were leaving, my wife comes out of the shop with our coffee. She asked me what happened and I told her that I was dealing with entitled boomers. Petty me said this loud enough to make sure that I was overheard.

Another man had been walking down the street, and must have witnessed what happened, because he told me that he was sorry that y he other guy was being an asshole.  The shop owner came outside to ask what happens, and tried to remain professional and neutral. My wife is took my side in the situation.

I’ve had a reactive, aggressive dog in the past. To me, that meant that I had to limit situations like these by removing myself and my dog. While I was certainly petty, I believe essentially I was entitled to sit there just as much as anyone else, when it came down to it.
