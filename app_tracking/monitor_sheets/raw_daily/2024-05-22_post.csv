0,1cy9a4w,UPDATE: AITA for shouting at my friend for showing off using my child?,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cu8v92/aita\_for\_shouting\_at\_my\_friend\_for\_showing\_off/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cu8v92/aita_for_shouting_at_my_friend_for_showing_off/)

Thank you all for your comments. I was happy to see that I wasn’t completely out of line with my outburst but I agree that the way we had been handling (or not handling) the situation wasn’t good.

We tried contacting Emily right after that incident but she just messaged our group chat that she was busy and she’ll get back to us. I managed to get hold of her after the post and invited her to have coffee at my place on Sunday.

We met with one other friend from the group. We thought having all of us there might be too much pressure. My husband took the baby to see my in-laws so he wasn’t there. It was a bit awkward and didn’t get better. I started by apologizing for shouting at her but told her that keeping my child from me wasn’t acceptable behavior from anyone. I told her that we know that she is good with kids and the kids like auntie Emily very much but sometimes she oversteps and gets in the way of how we want to parent our children. My friend gave a couple of examples of the situations but Emily refused to see any problem with her behavior.

Emily got really defensive and told us that we are really ungrateful for all the help she has given and she has put so much effort into kids that aren’t even hers . I told her that of course we are grateful for the help and all we need is for her to be a bit more mindful in certain situations. She doubled down on nothing being wrong about the way she acts. She also started getting nasty about our parenting and bringing up things that we did wrong. I know myself and my friends sometimes make mistakes as do all parents but my friends are great moms who love their kids and would do anything for them. 

Then she got really angry and told me that I don’t deserve my child as I didn’t even want him. Background to this was that I was hesitant to keep my child when I found out I was pregnant since I had had some mental health issues and I was really scared that I would get PPD and might not handle taking care of a baby. I’m so happy that I decided to have him but it was tough back then even with my husband being really supportive. That was the final straw and I kicked her out and told her she will never be  allowed around my child. After she left we called the others and told them what happened. We decided that we would take a step back from Emily for now.

Emily has since blocked all of us on everything. One of our other mutual friends told us that Emily has been making Facebook posts about fake friends who don’t appreciate her help and advice. She’s not naming names but everyone knows she’s talking about us. Most people have seen her in action at get togethers so they understand where we’re coming from. For now we are keeping our distance and maybe if she realizes the problem and apologizes then we might reconsider. ",UPDATE,2024-05-22,"UPDATE: AITA for shouting at my friend for showing off using my child?

1,1cy4xbi,AITA for calling a lady a Karen after she accosted me in a parking lot?,"So a lady got mad at me this morning because I didn't let her over into my lane of traffic. It was one of those situations where there was an added lane when two roads met, and neither lane has a yield sign, but there is a yellow ""lane added"" sign that gave me the right of way as long as I stayed in my lane. So I did what I do every day of my life when I drive that way, I stayed in my lane and continued on. I didn't even notice this woman or her car trying to get over. (I wasn't speeding or breaking any traffic laws)

This woman then decides to follow me to the strore to confront me. I went in, did my business, and was back in my car, when this woman walks straight up to my driver's side window and stares at me with a giant smile until I roll it down. Here's how the conversation went:

Her: ""I'm the person you cut off on the road earlier.""

Me: ""I have no idea what you're talking about""

Her: ""Then you need to pay more attention to what you are doing. You turned on \_\_\_\_\_ Rd. and then didn't let me over even though I had my blinker on.""

Me: ""Well I didn't see you, and I had the right of way. People turning right there don't have a yield sign; there's a lane added sign.""

Her: ""Well I thought you had a yield sign, and you need to be more respectful to people on the road. I couldn't get over even though I needed to and had my blinker on.""

Me: ""I'm late for work...""

Her: ""Well maybe you should try being nicer to people.""

Me: ""You should try following that advice yourself.""

Her: ""I'M VERY NICE!""

At this point I could have (and should have) just driven away, but I'd had it, and couldn't stop myself from saying ""Bye Karen!"" as I drove off. There's so much more I wanted to say to her about her rude and entitled behavior, and hate boiling down things like that to petty insults, and that's generally not a term I've used before to describe someone (to their face, at least).

I've felt bad about it since, as she definitely heard me and looked PISSED.

2,1cxpyoe,AITA for refusing to share the money (that I had) with my step-sister? ,"My parents divorced when I (16F) was 5, my dad remarried like 3-4 years after and his wife also has a daughter my age, let's call her Cora. 

Now, Cora and I get along just fine, tho we both can be really difficult toward one another. I didn't had any siblings for a long while, so sharing was difficult at first, still is, I try to be better, I try to not give my dad much trouble, but Cora can be a big pain in the ass because she's also selfish, but since I'm always ''the bigger person'' she's used just get her way. 

Now, we both have allowances that my dad gives us, 40-50 dollars every week (this doesn't count what he gives us for school lunches and other stuff, that money is just for us) my mom is a chef and I love to cook with her, so instead of buying lunch, I just pack my own, my dad still gives me money for lunch, but it's less than what he gives Cora because it's just to be ''fair'' and not to actually buy lunch, so I've saving that money for whatever. 

Last weekend my step-mom took us to a fair and it was super fun, dad gave us some money and I pulled some of what I already had ''just in case''. Well, Cora and I basically bought the same stuff (some snacks, a few trinkets and some t-shirts), she spent almost all her money, then, at some point she asked if I could ''give her some'' because she had ran out and wanted to buy something and I said no. because it was my money. She said it wasn't fair because I had that money because I refused ''to be normal'' and packed my lunch (something that apparently brings her shame???) I said I didn't care. My step-mom came and asked what happened, and when we explained, she offered Cora another 20 but Cora said that was she wanted to buy was 30 or 40?? and my step-mom only had that 20. Then she (my step-mom) asked me to do it and that she'd give me the money at home. 

I don't know why, maybe because Cora called me weird a bunch of times, or because I'm FED UP with her always getting her way, and I said no. My step-mom reminded me she was going to pay me and I said no either way. She said ''I wasn't being fair'', we had an argument and midway I said this should be talked with my dad and that shut her down.

4,1cxpnsb,AITA for leaving my friends at a concert?,"I (21f) went over to my friend's house Orange (21f) to grab something I had forgotten the last time I was there. I ended up hanging around for a couple of hours chatting with Orange and two of their roommates. 

Orange and their roommates Blue and Pink (both 21f) told me they were going to a local concert later and asked if I wanted to come with them. I said I'd pass as I had work in the morning and was hoping to be home before 10:30 that night. 

The time was coming for my friends to leave for their party when their other roommate Green (21m) arrived and told them their DD had canceled. They all got super stressed because they were drinking and smoking so nobody could drive. They asked if I could drive them (because I was the only sober person) and I told them to just get an Uber or Lift. They didn't want to because the concert was only 5 minutes away. So I told them to walk. They didn't want to because it was sketchy.

After begging me to drive them and promising they wouldn't stay long I agreed to drive them. On the condition that I was leaving at 10 whether they were in my car or not. Everyone agreed that was fair and that the band they wanted to see was playing at 9. 

Well we got to the venue at 8 and I discovered it was not in fact a formal concert it was basically a house party with live bands. About 100ish random people crammed into this tiny living room with a live band playing.  I began getting really uncomfortable, there was some sketchy stuff going on and I didn't feel safe. 

9 o'clock came around and the band they wanted to see still wasn't on. I told Orange I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave. The group ended up convincing me to stay a little longer. 10 o'clock rolled around and the band they wanted to see finally started. 

I rounded my friends up and told them it was time to go. They began begging me to stay and not abandon them here. I reminded them of the deal but they begged me not to leave them. So I stayed til around 10:30 that's when their original DD showed up. Turned out he could drive them he was just going to be late. 

I rounded my friends up again and told them their original DD was going to drive them home (he agreed and was sober). They began calling me a buzzkill and saying I was ditching them at a party. So I left, got Taco Bell and went home. 

Now they are all mad at me and saying I broke the ""girl code"" by leaving them drunk at a sketchy party. They all made it home safe with a sober driver so I don't see the issue. I agreed to drive them on the condition we leave at 10 they didn't want to leave so I found them a new ride and went home.

5,1cxp378,AITA for telling my husband where he is and isn’t allowed to poo,"Ideally this will be short and sweet. My husband, (33M) who will be referred to as Tyler, and I (27F) have been together nearly 8 years. We share a sizable home that has 5 bathrooms, each equipped with a functional toilet. In our master bedroom there are two toilets, each having its own lockable door. One of those toilets is mine and only mine and the other is strictly his. 

Tyler has had IBS for his entire life…if any of you don’t know, IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) is an intestinal disorder that causes pretty nasty poos. I’m talking like explosions that one may say “destroys” a toilet. This has never been a problem until we moved into this home. 

One of the bathrooms is located directly off the living room. We frequently have sitters come and go to care for our 3 year old son so that particular bathroom is used by them and whomever is over. A guest bathroom of sorts. 

I specifically asked that Tyler ONLY poo in his designated toilet in our master bathroom. I’m so tired of cleaning other toilets after his explosions. 

Tyler has never had to clean the toilets and never does. If I pester him, he would. It’s not that he doesn’t help with chores. He’s very helpful in other regards. But he never cleans up right after his poos. When I go in there after, the toilet (TMI) is coated, splattered, and straight up nasty. 

He still frequently uses the toilet off the living room to poo, causing nasty stank and toilet destruction. I have to clean it constantly and when I ask him to use his toilet to poo, he will say he doesn’t want to argue or I’m looking to pick a fight. This has been an issue now for months with no resolve. I have brought this up multiple times. 

I want to know, AITA? Why can’t he use HIS toilet for POOS. I don’t care if he pees downstairs! 

*EDIT BELOW 

To clarify, I am not saying he HAS to use only his toilet. What I mean is, I obviously prefer that he uses his toilet, but he can use the toilet downstairs if he cleans up after himself. But he does not. He doesn’t have to clean his own personally toilet after each use. 
When I ask him to clean up after he poos downstairs, he claims he doesn’t know where the cleaner is, although it is very obviously next to the toilet.

7,1cxotx4,AITA for putting my father in a bad spot with his girlfriend?,"My father has been with his girlfriend ""Jenny"" for about six years. I'm not fond of her (for reasons that aren't her fault), but we get along fine. She is very close with her mother, ""Tara"".

I'll be honest; I don't like Tara. She is a sour woman who complains about everything. It doesn't matter if it's food, gifts or even stuff that doesn't affect her. Nothing is ever good enough for Tara. Being around is so unbearable that even my father, who usually jumps at every opportunity to please Jenny, is open about how draining and annoying she is.

Tara lives in a different state, but visits Jenny often. I am always polite around her, but I never look forward to seeing her. Since I don't live with my father anymore, it's easy to avoid her visits.

My son is turning one this Saturday. My husband and I are throwing him a small birthday party at our apartment.

A couple days ago, we visited my father's place for lunch. Jenny informed us that her mother will be in town this weekend, and that she's excited that she'll be able to make it to my son's birthday.

Tara has met my baby once, when we went to my father's place for dinner last year, and it was awful. She criticized my and my husband's parenting, was judgy about the fact that I had a c-section, and complained about a dish my husband had prepared before even trying it (""Just because it looks nice, doesn't mean it tastes good""). With that night in mind, I have no interest in having Tara in my place, much less at my child's first birthday party.

As politely as I could, I told Jenny that we were only inviting close friends and family (which she already knew), and my husband and I don't have a close relationship with Tara. She argued that her mother had rescheduled her flight to be able to come, but I held my ground. I said we'd never invited her in the first place, and she had business doing so on our behalf.

We left about an hour later. The next day, my father told me that he and Jenny had a fight about the situation. At one point, she got him to admit that he doesn't like her mother.

He told me he's extremely upset that my refusal put him in a bad spot with his girlfriend. He agreed that it's not my job to please Jenny or Tara, but he still wants me to ""do the polite thing"" and invite his mother-in-law. When I refused to, he hung up on me.

I understand that my father is frustrated, but I don't want to invite Tara over just to make Jenny happy.

Today, he came over before our shift and caught me smoking a cigarette. I tried to hide it but it was super obvious. He got really upset and hasn’t spoken to me since.

Usually the one whose room was getting painted bought their friends beer or pizza or something, but there was no other compensation expected. It was understood to be a favor, and we’d listen to music, have fun, and get the job done quicker. 

I’m now in my early 30s, and I have a large room I need to paint. I casually asked one of my friends to help me out one weekend, and they responded by scoffing and saying something about using them for free labor. I thought they were joking, and asked again but they snapped at me saying it was messed up that I would ask them without offering to pay — pointing out that its a hard job and expensive to get professionals to do it. 

I was pretty shocked. If I had a free Saturday, I would totally help my friend paint a room and not expect anything more than maybe some free beer or dinner.

17,1cxngt1,AITA for saying I do not want my grandparents to attend my Highschool graduation?,"I, 18F, have made the decision to not want my grandparents company during my graduation ceremony. For context, they aren’t very interested in getting to know me and my sister (20F), but rather to treat us as tokens as we are intelligent and successful. They are narcissists. They do not bother to get to know us, they don’t treat us as grown individuals, and most of all, they hate and our mother for no reason other than divorcing our father. It’s a very complicated situation. 

My father invited them to my graduation without informing me or asking if it were alright, and when I had the conversation saying I want close family members at the ceremony, and more extended family members for celebrations later, he was very upset. As they did not attend my sisters graduation for many reasons, one being that they were literally on vacation, they think they are entitled to see mine. Being that I am the youngest in my family, it will be the only chance they get. 

I can understand how my father sympathizes with them, and I can understand how badly they want to see me cross the stage as they are older and want to experience it. But honestly, they have caused me nothing but distress when they visit, whether it be small degrading comments, their invasive nature…They are just miserable to be around. I can handle Christmas and other family gatherings not related to me, but having to put my foot down for this has made me feel very antagonized. I know they love me, but they don’t know me, and don’t care to know me. I don’t want strangers at my graduation ceremony, but I can’t stand being told I am wrong for this.

We have really long days on campus, so many of us often eat during our night lectures. However, Haylee seems to have one sided beef with me. Every crunch, every time I sneeze or cough, etc, she will turn around and glare at me. It's really annoying and makes me self conscious. Well, the other day my friend brought popcorn. I understand popcorn is annoying, but I tried to eat it as slowly and quietly as humanly possible out of consideration. Well, the second I so much as made a single crunch, she'd be turning around and glaring at me. It's so petty but it's really getting under my skin. I went home and my roommate said that I'm TA for eating something crunchy in class. I would agree, but she seems to be annoyed with my mere existence whenever I make the slightest of noise.

He is extremely close with his family, particularly his mom. They are insistent that he fly home to spend every single holiday with them (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.) because they are incredibly important to his family. I told him that I wanted to spend at least one holiday with him and he encouraged me to come celebrate with his family. I declined his offer because traveling gives me severe anxiety and his family makes me uncomfortable.  

His immediate family is quite messy and there is always drama happening in the house. In addition, we do not have any privacy in the home. Whenever I visit his family I get extremely sick due to my anxiety and most of the trip I have to lay in bed. 

I did not think it would be a big deal to at least spend just one holiday with me and my family, but he said that NOBODY in his family misses a holiday and he refuses to budge. Either I go with him or he goes alone. I don’t want to be separated for my family but I don’t think it’s fair to be apart from my family for every holiday either…

21,1cxmyx2,AITA for getting mad for my friend changing times," 

I am posting about my friend and I; she is aware of this post. We just want to know who is correct in this situation.   Let’s call me A(female), my friend will be B(female), and third-party C(female). I am not a fan of C; my friend wanted me to mention this. Ok, I dislike C, lol.

  So, I have limited time due to finals/summer school/work, etc. I made plans with B two weeks ahead of time, it was dinner plans and some shopping. I did mention that this would be in the evening/afternoon, and we agreed.

  A few days before the day; B calls me telling me to change plans from afternoon to morning.  I let B know that I couldn’t, I had group work to do in the morning. B made plans with C; we had already agreed on a day, and it was understood that we would hang afternoon/evening.  

I got mad at B because I asked B not to make plans that day since we were going out.  B thinks I am a hypocrite for asking her not to make plans, but I had to work myself.  I told B that she could have hung out with C in the morning.  I told her that it was rude to ask me to change times a few days before our outing.  We had plans before she made plans with C. We had agreed on a day and time weeks before the outing, I told her that it is rude to plan something with C during our planned time.

I also want to add something, B did not ask me if we could change the times. I was not asked if I was ok with this.  B came out telling me, “Hey let's hang in the morning, I am doing something with C tonight.”

 My friend B does not think that she did anything wrong.  B thinks that I was hypocritical since I planned work in the morning.  B argues that I asked her not to plan something that day, and I made work plans.   I have tried to explain the issue is that she is taking over our planned time.   B could have seen C in the morning, why am I expected to change the time to make C happy?

I want an apology; these work plans were made during a time that would not affect our plans at all.  C thinks that I am wrong, and what is the big deal.  B is offended that I said Hell no at agreeing to a time change.

So, who is the asshole?

A(me) or B and tell us why, please.  
Either, I or B are blind and don’t see it.

22,1cxmy8q,WIBTA if I took my sister’s cat with me when moving out?,"My sister and I live with our parents. She is 7, I am 18. We have 4 cats. Joey, Vesper, and our 2 kittens; which are Vesper and Joey’s babies. We originally planned on rehoming the two younger kittens as 4 cats is too much. My mom, however, absolutely fell in love with them and after talking to my dad decided to keep them.

Joey was the first cat we got and he was an impulse purchase by my dad. My little sister (6 at the time) saw kittens being sold on the side of the road and asked dad for one, which he immediately obliged. Even though Joey was bought for my little sister, he took to me. I am his favorite person in the house, he follows me around, meows for me to pet him, and sometimes jumps on my shoulders/in my arms so I have to hold him. 

He does these things to other people in the house but not nearly as much as he does me. To put it in perspective, my mom was surprised one day (months after we got him) that he followed her around the kitchen asking to be pet because he keeps to himself so much when I’m not around. 

I’m moving out sometime this summer and although I have all the means to take care of animals, I originally didn’t plan to get any living things for a few months or even years. After finding out that my current house is now going to have 4 cats living in it, I thought about taking Joey and Vesper with me. 

My line of reasoning being that 1. my little sister is (mildly) allergic to cats so having this many in the house could harm her, 2. having 4 cats pooping in one litter box is making the house smell, 3. my mom loves the 2 kittens so she could never get rid of them, 4. I have the means to take care of 2 cats, and 5. I really love Joey and I’d be upset to leave him behind. 

I would also be taking Vesper with me because it would help all the previous problems, plus Joey and her grew up around eachother so separating them feels wrong. 

Where I might be TA: it’s still my little sister’s cat. Even though she’s little and doesn’t quite know how to take care of an animal she still loves him a lot. I’m kind of worried she’d brand me as “the B*tch who stole her cat” 

She wants me to take Vesper and one of the kittens, but the thing is I don’t really like the kittens or vesper all that much. I still love them and care for them but if it’s the choice between them or no cats, I’d take no cats. I’m worried I sound selfish when I pitch the idea.
