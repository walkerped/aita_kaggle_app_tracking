0,1cy9a4w,UPDATE: AITA for shouting at my friend for showing off using my child?,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cu8v92/aita\_for\_shouting\_at\_my\_friend\_for\_showing\_off/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cu8v92/aita_for_shouting_at_my_friend_for_showing_off/)

Thank you all for your comments. I was happy to see that I wasn’t completely out of line with my outburst but I agree that the way we had been handling (or not handling) the situation wasn’t good.

We tried contacting Emily right after that incident but she just messaged our group chat that she was busy and she’ll get back to us. I managed to get hold of her after the post and invited her to have coffee at my place on Sunday.

We met with one other friend from the group. We thought having all of us there might be too much pressure. My husband took the baby to see my in-laws so he wasn’t there. It was a bit awkward and didn’t get better. I started by apologizing for shouting at her but told her that keeping my child from me wasn’t acceptable behavior from anyone. I told her that we know that she is good with kids and the kids like auntie Emily very much but sometimes she oversteps and gets in the way of how we want to parent our children. My friend gave a couple of examples of the situations but Emily refused to see any problem with her behavior.

Emily got really defensive and told us that we are really ungrateful for all the help she has given and she has put so much effort into kids that aren’t even hers . I told her that of course we are grateful for the help and all we need is for her to be a bit more mindful in certain situations. She doubled down on nothing being wrong about the way she acts. She also started getting nasty about our parenting and bringing up things that we did wrong. I know myself and my friends sometimes make mistakes as do all parents but my friends are great moms who love their kids and would do anything for them. 

Then she got really angry and told me that I don’t deserve my child as I didn’t even want him. Background to this was that I was hesitant to keep my child when I found out I was pregnant since I had had some mental health issues and I was really scared that I would get PPD and might not handle taking care of a baby. I’m so happy that I decided to have him but it was tough back then even with my husband being really supportive. That was the final straw and I kicked her out and told her she will never be  allowed around my child. After she left we called the others and told them what happened. We decided that we would take a step back from Emily for now.

Emily has since blocked all of us on everything. One of our other mutual friends told us that Emily has been making Facebook posts about fake friends who don’t appreciate her help and advice. She’s not naming names but everyone knows she’s talking about us. Most people have seen her in action at get togethers so they understand where we’re coming from. For now we are keeping our distance and maybe if she realizes the problem and apologizes then we might reconsider. ",UPDATE,2024-05-22,"UPDATE: AITA for shouting at my friend for showing off using my child?

1,1cy4xbi,AITA for calling a lady a Karen after she accosted me in a parking lot?,"So a lady got mad at me this morning because I didn't let her over into my lane of traffic. It was one of those situations where there was an added lane when two roads met, and neither lane has a yield sign, but there is a yellow ""lane added"" sign that gave me the right of way as long as I stayed in my lane. So I did what I do every day of my life when I drive that way, I stayed in my lane and continued on. I didn't even notice this woman or her car trying to get over. (I wasn't speeding or breaking any traffic laws)

This woman then decides to follow me to the strore to confront me. I went in, did my business, and was back in my car, when this woman walks straight up to my driver's side window and stares at me with a giant smile until I roll it down. Here's how the conversation went:

Her: ""I'm the person you cut off on the road earlier.""

Me: ""I have no idea what you're talking about""

Her: ""Then you need to pay more attention to what you are doing. You turned on \_\_\_\_\_ Rd. and then didn't let me over even though I had my blinker on.""

Me: ""Well I didn't see you, and I had the right of way. People turning right there don't have a yield sign; there's a lane added sign.""

Her: ""Well I thought you had a yield sign, and you need to be more respectful to people on the road. I couldn't get over even though I needed to and had my blinker on.""

Me: ""I'm late for work...""

Her: ""Well maybe you should try being nicer to people.""

Me: ""You should try following that advice yourself.""

Her: ""I'M VERY NICE!""

At this point I could have (and should have) just driven away, but I'd had it, and couldn't stop myself from saying ""Bye Karen!"" as I drove off. There's so much more I wanted to say to her about her rude and entitled behavior, and hate boiling down things like that to petty insults, and that's generally not a term I've used before to describe someone (to their face, at least).

I've felt bad about it since, as she definitely heard me and looked PISSED.

2,1cxpyoe,AITA for refusing to share the money (that I had) with my step-sister? ,"My parents divorced when I (16F) was 5, my dad remarried like 3-4 years after and his wife also has a daughter my age, let's call her Cora. 

Now, Cora and I get along just fine, tho we both can be really difficult toward one another. I didn't had any siblings for a long while, so sharing was difficult at first, still is, I try to be better, I try to not give my dad much trouble, but Cora can be a big pain in the ass because she's also selfish, but since I'm always ''the bigger person'' she's used just get her way. 

Now, we both have allowances that my dad gives us, 40-50 dollars every week (this doesn't count what he gives us for school lunches and other stuff, that money is just for us) my mom is a chef and I love to cook with her, so instead of buying lunch, I just pack my own, my dad still gives me money for lunch, but it's less than what he gives Cora because it's just to be ''fair'' and not to actually buy lunch, so I've saving that money for whatever. 

Last weekend my step-mom took us to a fair and it was super fun, dad gave us some money and I pulled some of what I already had ''just in case''. Well, Cora and I basically bought the same stuff (some snacks, a few trinkets and some t-shirts), she spent almost all her money, then, at some point she asked if I could ''give her some'' because she had ran out and wanted to buy something and I said no. because it was my money. She said it wasn't fair because I had that money because I refused ''to be normal'' and packed my lunch (something that apparently brings her shame???) I said I didn't care. My step-mom came and asked what happened, and when we explained, she offered Cora another 20 but Cora said that was she wanted to buy was 30 or 40?? and my step-mom only had that 20. Then she (my step-mom) asked me to do it and that she'd give me the money at home. 

I don't know why, maybe because Cora called me weird a bunch of times, or because I'm FED UP with her always getting her way, and I said no. My step-mom reminded me she was going to pay me and I said no either way. She said ''I wasn't being fair'', we had an argument and midway I said this should be talked with my dad and that shut her down.

4,1cxpnsb,AITA for leaving my friends at a concert?,"I (21f) went over to my friend's house Orange (21f) to grab something I had forgotten the last time I was there. I ended up hanging around for a couple of hours chatting with Orange and two of their roommates. 

Orange and their roommates Blue and Pink (both 21f) told me they were going to a local concert later and asked if I wanted to come with them. I said I'd pass as I had work in the morning and was hoping to be home before 10:30 that night. 

The time was coming for my friends to leave for their party when their other roommate Green (21m) arrived and told them their DD had canceled. They all got super stressed because they were drinking and smoking so nobody could drive. They asked if I could drive them (because I was the only sober person) and I told them to just get an Uber or Lift. They didn't want to because the concert was only 5 minutes away. So I told them to walk. They didn't want to because it was sketchy.

After begging me to drive them and promising they wouldn't stay long I agreed to drive them. On the condition that I was leaving at 10 whether they were in my car or not. Everyone agreed that was fair and that the band they wanted to see was playing at 9. 

Well we got to the venue at 8 and I discovered it was not in fact a formal concert it was basically a house party with live bands. About 100ish random people crammed into this tiny living room with a live band playing.  I began getting really uncomfortable, there was some sketchy stuff going on and I didn't feel safe. 

9 o'clock came around and the band they wanted to see still wasn't on. I told Orange I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave. The group ended up convincing me to stay a little longer. 10 o'clock rolled around and the band they wanted to see finally started. 

I rounded my friends up and told them it was time to go. They began begging me to stay and not abandon them here. I reminded them of the deal but they begged me not to leave them. So I stayed til around 10:30 that's when their original DD showed up. Turned out he could drive them he was just going to be late. 

I rounded my friends up again and told them their original DD was going to drive them home (he agreed and was sober). They began calling me a buzzkill and saying I was ditching them at a party. So I left, got Taco Bell and went home. 

Now they are all mad at me and saying I broke the ""girl code"" by leaving them drunk at a sketchy party. They all made it home safe with a sober driver so I don't see the issue. I agreed to drive them on the condition we leave at 10 they didn't want to leave so I found them a new ride and went home.

5,1cxp378,AITA for telling my husband where he is and isn’t allowed to poo,"Ideally this will be short and sweet. My husband, (33M) who will be referred to as Tyler, and I (27F) have been together nearly 8 years. We share a sizable home that has 5 bathrooms, each equipped with a functional toilet. In our master bedroom there are two toilets, each having its own lockable door. One of those toilets is mine and only mine and the other is strictly his. 

Tyler has had IBS for his entire life…if any of you don’t know, IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) is an intestinal disorder that causes pretty nasty poos. I’m talking like explosions that one may say “destroys” a toilet. This has never been a problem until we moved into this home. 

One of the bathrooms is located directly off the living room. We frequently have sitters come and go to care for our 3 year old son so that particular bathroom is used by them and whomever is over. A guest bathroom of sorts. 

I specifically asked that Tyler ONLY poo in his designated toilet in our master bathroom. I’m so tired of cleaning other toilets after his explosions. 

Tyler has never had to clean the toilets and never does. If I pester him, he would. It’s not that he doesn’t help with chores. He’s very helpful in other regards. But he never cleans up right after his poos. When I go in there after, the toilet (TMI) is coated, splattered, and straight up nasty. 

He still frequently uses the toilet off the living room to poo, causing nasty stank and toilet destruction. I have to clean it constantly and when I ask him to use his toilet to poo, he will say he doesn’t want to argue or I’m looking to pick a fight. This has been an issue now for months with no resolve. I have brought this up multiple times. 

I want to know, AITA? Why can’t he use HIS toilet for POOS. I don’t care if he pees downstairs! 

*EDIT BELOW 

To clarify, I am not saying he HAS to use only his toilet. What I mean is, I obviously prefer that he uses his toilet, but he can use the toilet downstairs if he cleans up after himself. But he does not. He doesn’t have to clean his own personally toilet after each use. 
When I ask him to clean up after he poos downstairs, he claims he doesn’t know where the cleaner is, although it is very obviously next to the toilet.

7,1cxotx4,AITA for putting my father in a bad spot with his girlfriend?,"My father has been with his girlfriend ""Jenny"" for about six years. I'm not fond of her (for reasons that aren't her fault), but we get along fine. She is very close with her mother, ""Tara"".

I'll be honest; I don't like Tara. She is a sour woman who complains about everything. It doesn't matter if it's food, gifts or even stuff that doesn't affect her. Nothing is ever good enough for Tara. Being around is so unbearable that even my father, who usually jumps at every opportunity to please Jenny, is open about how draining and annoying she is.

Tara lives in a different state, but visits Jenny often. I am always polite around her, but I never look forward to seeing her. Since I don't live with my father anymore, it's easy to avoid her visits.

My son is turning one this Saturday. My husband and I are throwing him a small birthday party at our apartment.

A couple days ago, we visited my father's place for lunch. Jenny informed us that her mother will be in town this weekend, and that she's excited that she'll be able to make it to my son's birthday.

Tara has met my baby once, when we went to my father's place for dinner last year, and it was awful. She criticized my and my husband's parenting, was judgy about the fact that I had a c-section, and complained about a dish my husband had prepared before even trying it (""Just because it looks nice, doesn't mean it tastes good""). With that night in mind, I have no interest in having Tara in my place, much less at my child's first birthday party.

As politely as I could, I told Jenny that we were only inviting close friends and family (which she already knew), and my husband and I don't have a close relationship with Tara. She argued that her mother had rescheduled her flight to be able to come, but I held my ground. I said we'd never invited her in the first place, and she had business doing so on our behalf.

We left about an hour later. The next day, my father told me that he and Jenny had a fight about the situation. At one point, she got him to admit that he doesn't like her mother.

He told me he's extremely upset that my refusal put him in a bad spot with his girlfriend. He agreed that it's not my job to please Jenny or Tara, but he still wants me to ""do the polite thing"" and invite his mother-in-law. When I refused to, he hung up on me.

I understand that my father is frustrated, but I don't want to invite Tara over just to make Jenny happy.

Today, he came over before our shift and caught me smoking a cigarette. I tried to hide it but it was super obvious. He got really upset and hasn’t spoken to me since.

Usually the one whose room was getting painted bought their friends beer or pizza or something, but there was no other compensation expected. It was understood to be a favor, and we’d listen to music, have fun, and get the job done quicker. 

I’m now in my early 30s, and I have a large room I need to paint. I casually asked one of my friends to help me out one weekend, and they responded by scoffing and saying something about using them for free labor. I thought they were joking, and asked again but they snapped at me saying it was messed up that I would ask them without offering to pay — pointing out that its a hard job and expensive to get professionals to do it. 

I was pretty shocked. If I had a free Saturday, I would totally help my friend paint a room and not expect anything more than maybe some free beer or dinner.

17,1cxngt1,AITA for saying I do not want my grandparents to attend my Highschool graduation?,"I, 18F, have made the decision to not want my grandparents company during my graduation ceremony. For context, they aren’t very interested in getting to know me and my sister (20F), but rather to treat us as tokens as we are intelligent and successful. They are narcissists. They do not bother to get to know us, they don’t treat us as grown individuals, and most of all, they hate and our mother for no reason other than divorcing our father. It’s a very complicated situation. 

My father invited them to my graduation without informing me or asking if it were alright, and when I had the conversation saying I want close family members at the ceremony, and more extended family members for celebrations later, he was very upset. As they did not attend my sisters graduation for many reasons, one being that they were literally on vacation, they think they are entitled to see mine. Being that I am the youngest in my family, it will be the only chance they get. 

I can understand how my father sympathizes with them, and I can understand how badly they want to see me cross the stage as they are older and want to experience it. But honestly, they have caused me nothing but distress when they visit, whether it be small degrading comments, their invasive nature…They are just miserable to be around.

I am posting about my friend and I; she is aware of this post. We just want to know who is correct in this situation.   Let’s call me A(female), my friend will be B(female), and third-party C(female). I am not a fan of C; my friend wanted me to mention this. Ok, I dislike C, lol.

  So, I have limited time due to finals/summer school/work, etc. I made plans with B two weeks ahead of time, it was dinner plans and some shopping. I did mention that this would be in the evening/afternoon, and we agreed.

  A few days before the day; B calls me telling me to change plans from afternoon to morning.  I let B know that I couldn’t, I had group work to do in the morning. B made plans with C; we had already agreed on a day, and it was understood that we would hang afternoon/evening.  

I got mad at B because I asked B not to make plans that day since we were going out.  B thinks I am a hypocrite for asking her not to make plans, but I had to work myself.  I told B that she could have hung out with C in the morning.  I told her that it was rude to ask me to change times a few days before our outing.  We had plans before she made plans with C. We had agreed on a day and time weeks before the outing, I told her that it is rude to plan something with C during our planned time.

I also want to add something, B did not ask me if we could change the times. I was not asked if I was ok with this.  B came out telling me, “Hey let's hang in the morning, I am doing something with C tonight.”

 My friend B does not think that she did anything wrong.  B thinks that I was hypocritical since I planned work in the morning.  B argues that I asked her not to plan something that day, and I made work plans.   I have tried to explain the issue is that she is taking over our planned time.   B could have seen C in the morning, why am I expected to change the time to make C happy?

I want an apology; these work plans were made during a time that would not affect our plans at all.  C thinks that I am wrong, and what is the big deal.  B is offended that I said Hell no at agreeing to a time change.

So, who is the asshole?

Joey, Vesper, and our 2 kittens; which are Vesper and Joey’s babies. We originally planned on rehoming the two younger kittens as 4 cats is too much. My mom, however, absolutely fell in love with them and after talking to my dad decided to keep them.

Joey was the first cat we got and he was an impulse purchase by my dad. My little sister (6 at the time) saw kittens being sold on the side of the road and asked dad for one, which he immediately obliged. Even though Joey was bought for my little sister, he took to me. I am his favorite person in the house, he follows me around, meows for me to pet him, and sometimes jumps on my shoulders/in my arms so I have to hold him. 

He does these things to other people in the house but not nearly as much as he does me. To put it in perspective, my mom was surprised one day (months after we got him) that he followed her around the kitchen asking to be pet because he keeps to himself so much when I’m not around. 

I’m moving out sometime this summer and although I have all the means to take care of animals, I originally didn’t plan to get any living things for a few months or even years. After finding out that my current house is now going to have 4 cats living in it, I thought about taking Joey and Vesper with me. 

My line of reasoning being that 1. my little sister is (mildly) allergic to cats so having this many in the house could harm her, 2. having 4 cats pooping in one litter box is making the house smell, 3. my mom loves the 2 kittens so she could never get rid of them, 4. I have the means to take care of 2 cats, and 5. I really love Joey and I’d be upset to leave him behind. 

I would also be taking Vesper with me because it would help all the previous problems, plus Joey and her grew up around eachother so separating them feels wrong. 

Where I might be TA: it’s still my little sister’s cat. Even though she’s little and doesn’t quite know how to take care of an animal she still loves him a lot. I’m kind of worried she’d brand me as “the B*tch who stole her cat” 

She wants me to take Vesper and one of the kittens, but the thing is I don’t really like the kittens or vesper all that much. I still love them and care for them but if it’s the choice between them or no cats, I’d take no cats. I’m worried I sound selfish when I pitch the idea.

My family and I now live in the same state/city as Lisa, while her family live in a different state across the country, and Lisa and I have no relationship.

Last week, our grandparents that we both have not seen in years came to visit USA.

I guess Lisa for whatever reason did not fly out to her parent’s house to see my grandparents, and tried to schedule to see them while they were with me and my family. She invited our grandparents out for dinner, and I decided to come along since our grandparents are getting old and they might need help. Lisa acted annoyed when she saw me, we only exchanged pleasantries and she only talked to our grandparents the entire dinner.  

At the end of dinner, Lisa went to the bathroom, and I asked for the bill since I figured I am the older grand son and I should pay.

Once she dropped us off, grandma thanked me for the dinner and thanked Lisa for driving and picking the restaurant.

My ex has a pattern of financial manipulation and control (part of why he is my ex) which has come into play recently. He works for a university where a benefit is free tuition for our children. He does not pay for this benefit. 

Our younger child is about to go to college and ex has asked me to pay 100% of the college expenses (room, board, books) since his benefit covers the tuition. Since we had agreed to split all expenses 50/50, I said no, but have agreed to cover 50% of the tax implications since the free tuition counts as income. Note that the older child did not go to a school where that benefit could be utilized, so this was not a factor for her.

He has now threatened to revoke the benefit entirely from both of our kids so that I would have to pay 1/2 of all expenses, but I believe this would also mean he would have to pay 1/2 out of pocket which seems like an impact to him as well. I do not know if he can reject just a portion of the tuition. Additionally, the kids would need to get loans to cover at least some of the expenses. 

Would I be the asshole if I continue to refuse to pay the full non-tuition costs?

About my friend group. Z 19F, L 21F, A 22F, T 22F.

Months ago, Z told me(20F) her, L, & another in our group got tickets to a concert. (group of 6) I was hurt. Z said she didnt invite me or A bc we live around 6-7 hrs away. A & I are currently live a 3-4 hr away from our group, bc of college. Still, it wouldnt hurt to ask if Id be in town, since it would be closer to holidays. A & I were both not invited, bc distance & I didn’t fuss. Z & L didnt invite T bc L didnt want to pay that much. 

This past week T told me that Z, L, & A are going to another concert. T said she mentioned this specific artist to L, & L told her that she had the artists presales. T asked with who, L had told her not to worry about it. Later, L told T that it was Z & A. T went to me to vent. T didn’t know about the 1st & I, the 2nd. Im upset bc Z, A, & L are going to this concert during the time I would be at college, in A’s college town, a 45m drive from me.

I temporarily pulled away from Z, A, & L. Z apologized, & said that we have a whole life together & a lot more concerts. L apologized, & invited me to another show (I found out later L previously invited A to that concert, not me) I emphasized that I was not mad, just got hurt.
 
Now, A asked if we were going to her graduation. Z & L, yes. T  had work, & cant call off. I said no bc a guest is with me & don’t feel okay leaving him in my familys home. I felt it was too short notice to accomodations. A texted me, saying shes disappointed in me. She asked if it was reactionary bc me & T are mad. I said it wasnt, I forgot the date & couldnt make accommodations for my situation. I was busy between her telling us about graduation & rn. I wasnt actively thinking about it. A was hurt to hear I forgot, & didnt respond after I said her worth in my life, how I’m sad I cant go, & what I meant. T apologized to A, but got nothing.

T was mad that L&Z only apologized to me. T sent L a text, she has feelings too, not just me. L sent her a text about how it isnt that deep, we’re dramatic, they never got mad when we hung out w/ others. L is incredibly mad to hear that we forgot a huge event, & chose to be upset rather than make effort. But, it isnt the same. Me & T are making plans w/ people that they dont know, not people in the group. L said dont text her.

I feel I have a valid reason not to go. Staying over at A’s place for 2-3 days isn’t feasible. I wouldnt want to ask if my guest can stay at A’s place. I do not have funds to book a hotel. L said Im a bad friend to A bc I wasnt actively thinking about her, & was making it their problem that I was hurt. Im frustrated theyre grouping two situations together. Our other friend said that she cant go bc of a birthday party, yet she never got a text? I just feel like we’re being “targeted” bc the concert, & it’s sort of taking away from our legitimate reasons for not being able to go.

Anyway, Josh has been such a hell to live with because he is too... spacious? I mean, he is always entitled to use every free space in the house, and that drives me crazy because there's no empty useful and visual space in the common areas of our house.

And this applies to the fridge. When we moved in together, we decided to share the shelves equally, reserving the freezer and a common one shelf to big groceries, jars and stuff, but Josh doesn't follow the rules and uses all that space for his things. Always.

Last week, I was alone at home and opened the fridge and smelled something weird. And looking trough it, I found some of Josh's food pretty rotten. It was some vegetables that weren't packed, full of mold, some of it was releasing liquids etc. I readily decided to throw it away, since the fridge is a closed environment and that fod could spoil all the other stuff.

Particularly that positivity you’d get from significant other.

However on showing my drawing and saying how I wasn’t feeling it was great and botanical art isn’t t that popular.

He then continued to critique it saying how it wasn’t my best work and I was probably waiting my time & to listen to his advice so I don’t waste weeks making artwork that nobody would want.
I was hurt by this as he knows I want to make large paintings to sell but also thrown. as I’ve always been supportive when he’s got stuck or run down at creative writing which is his new found passion.

I responded calmly at first but gradually got more annoyed as he didn’t get the hint.

As I didn’t ask for his critique and that he’s not really in a position to give one either given he’s not a artist or qualified to give feedback 
(FYI: I actually studied art BA&MA level an he did business BA)

His response was candid art is subjective and I’m not going to lie to you about my opinion.
it’s also a red flag in our relationship how I was reacting In being confrontational.

33,1cyd9n9,AITA for expecting my boyfriend to feed my cats while I’m away?,"TL;DR - AITA for thinking my partner should feed my cats while I’m away for a couple of days?

My partner (36 M) and I (42 F) have been together almost 2 years. We had planned to move in together in 3 months. 

Every year I like to take a trip on my birthday. This year he can’t make it. We’d discussed this, and he said it was fine that I go on my own. 

Since he can’t make it on the trip with me I’d asked him to look after my cats and/or my house. He’d said he’d check his schedule and get back to me. I’d asked again a couple of days ago, same response. Today I told him I needed an answer, and he acts as if it’s this huge and sudden imposition. At first he said he can’t make it to feed my cats for part of my trip, then he can only make it one or two days, then it’s “well aren’t you coming home that night anyways?” Can’t I just hire someone or find a friend to do it?  

I guess I’d thought that boyfriends should be ok with that kind of stuff, especially those planning on moving in together soon anyway.  I don’t expect him to upend his whole life, just to feed my danged cats for a few days. 

I feel very frustrated at his unwillingness to help, and wonder if maybe it’s not the best idea to move in together.  I also wonder if my expectations were unfair. 

So what say you, redditors?  AITA for expecting my boyfriend to be able to feed my cats for a couple of days?

UPDATE: After talking it over for like an hour and a half he agreed to feed my cats for part of the week. This was after he complained he’d have to upend his plans and maybe put off buying a new TV.  In his view he’d intended to be helpful when he suggested other people who could help, and stated that it wasn’t his intent to absolve himself of any responsibility.  After an hour and a half discussion he still didn’t understand why I was still upset and tried to argue that we needed to resolve this NOW. 

I do appreciate the help with feeding my cats, and I did thank him for doing it. I don’t intend on ever having kids, so my furry family means a lot to me. It’s still my view that it shouldn’t have taken that much to secure it in the first place - THAT is what upset me. I worry about what could happen if it snows and it’s his turn to shovel the driveway; I get sick and need help with household chores till I recover; or if I need help taking care of mowing the lawn. I’m seeing some red flags I’d maybe kind of glossed over in the past.

I do appreciate the help with feeding my cats, and I did thank him for doing it. I don’t intend on ever having kids, so my furry family means a lot to me. It’s still my view that it shouldn’t have taken that much to secure it in the first place - THAT is what upset me. I worry about what could happen if it snows and it’s his turn to shovel the driveway; I get sick and need help with household chores till I recover; or if I need help taking care of mowing the lawn. I’m seeing some red flags I’d maybe kind of glossed over in the past. 

I have a lot to think about. ",0.0,1.0184307098388672,1,0

36,1cyct4u,AITA for telling my SIL to stop mooching off my brother?,"Throwaway so my friends and family don't get involved. My sister-in-law (32f) came over to my(28f) house yesterday and while she was here she was  texting with my brother. At one point she took her wedding ring off and said she ""couldn't do this anymore!"".

I, thinking it something serious, asked if she was okay and everything was alright. She was upset because my brother wouldn't take her to a place she wanted to go for their weekly date night, no monthly weekend vacations, not many just-because gifts, they split expenses, yada yada. She went on this whole spiel about how the creators she follows on TikTok are right that if he wanted to, he would. This is where I might've started veering into AH territory. 

I've given my brother money for dates, gifts, and day trips before, but never asked why. Just figured maybe short on cash  though AFAIK my brother makes about 61k a year. Not amazing money but really good for our area. I asked her what her income was, their split was, does she pay for dates/gifts, and if dates/mini vacations are paid for from a joint account so I can help her think of a way to approach this with my brother.

Welp. She's just started making 38k with ability to earn up to 60k the longer she's at her company and they have a 70/30 split. She never pays. I did the math and showed her the numbers. She's contributing 949 to his 3558 but keeping 2217 to his 1525. Monthly. I told her I've helped him pay for things for them before and it's probably more that he can't afford to pay than it is he doesn't want to. She suggested she tell him to save more and at that point I told her ""Or, you can pay for these nice dates, objects, and day trips you want since you're keeping more of your monthly pay then him. Or you two start paying for them from a joint account. Either way stop mooching off him and having a hissy fit he isn't spending money on you like you think he should.""

38,1cycjud,AITA For Wanting a Stress-Free Summer Break?,"A couple of days ago my mom told me and my younger sister that my dad had enrolled us in two different summer courses. One of them being an sat summer boot camp that lasts for 10 weeks with meetings three days every week. The other is a civics class which only meets twice a month, which isn't so bad!

I'm about to go into my junior year of high school so I can understand that it would be very beneficial for me to have some extra study help but with the end of the school year approaching right now, i just feel so burnt out. My younger sister and I are still taking our final exams. With the knowledge that i have a whole summer's worth of studying ahead of me, all the motivation and happiness that i had for reaching summer break and finishing up finals has dissipated.

If he had wanted me and my sister to go to these classes because my grades were bad or I genuinely needed the help, I would be totally for it and try to improve myself. The thing is that I'm not bad student by any means, I'm close to the top of my class and have consistently kept up very high grades all year.

What makes me most disappointed is he's doing this to impress one of his friends. He doesn't care about school. He's only ever been to one of my sister's violin concerts, and that was over a year ago. She's been playing and practicing violin for 3 years now and he still doesn't care enough to show up to her concerts. He's missed award ceremonies and parent-teacher meetings on more occasions than I can count and would much rather me and my sister be enrolled in a religious private school, it's what he's fought my mom for for 10 years. Even when my grades weren't the best in middle school, he didn't care and didn't do anything about it. I don't want my sister and I to be used as pretty little possessions to make him look better in front of his friends.

Along with that, my mom is extremely against us going to these classes, but she's elaborated that there's absolutely nothing that she can do about it. I'm really grateful to her because she's kept me out of my dad putting us in a religious private school so I'm fine with summer school but I still feel completely defeated.

They're each hundreds of dollars and I feel terrible that he spent all that money on something that we absolutely do not have any interest in attending and could've been better spent somewhere else.

39,1cycfu2,AITA for asking for my finances/career/choices to be private from in-laws?,"My partner and I have been together for half a decade. We are in our mid/late 20s and have lived at our parents for the last few years to both save up while working/ finish school and now that my parents are moving a few hours away, we have decided this next year is probably a good time to move out together. My partner told his parents he plans on moving out this year just to keep them informed and their response was nothing and then a few days later was “we have a few concerns” and then asked questions about my financial situation, my job, and overall things that me and my partner have discussed many times and are already on the same page with/figured out. My partner informed me of what they said and it is bothering me. Here’s why: 

1. The in-laws didn’t mention one positive thing about the concept of us moving out. Me and my partner are are respectable times in our life and relationship (he is proposing soon) and I find it odd (if not slightly rude) that they either said nothing or only negative things (concerns/questions). Doesn’t quite feel supportive. 
2. The parents are not financially supporting us in this move. Why are they giving their opinion? They won’t be living with us or have any share in our banking or choices ultimately so why say anything - especially when its negative/interrogative? 
3. We have made this decision ourselves and discussed as partners how we can financially support ourselves. One thing leading to this choice is the fact that my partner wants to get away from the toxic nature of his household at times. We both are taking on extra work on top of our careers to save up and plan on splitting the down payment halfway. We are both working hard and making sure this is plausible and financially smart for us. 
4. I was raised in a household where we were guided with strong values/knowledge but ultimately made our own choices and learned from them. This is in my personal definition of mutual respect. I feel the in-laws questioning my partner about my finances/work and this decision we made as a couple while i’m not there is disrespectful. 
5. They are hypocrites. They rushed everything (marriage/house/kids) before they could afford it/manage it. My MIL who seems to be the most “concerned” didn’t even have a job when she got engaged/married and moved in with my FIL. I have a career and a very respectable one and also run two side businesses on the weekends - I am hard working and do not make big financial decisions like this lightly. When they let their own in-laws give them advice on work/financials it led to them losing their house. 

Overall, I just feel like even without the points above a couples decision to purchase a home financially independent should be free from parental “opinions” and questions.

In my current role I am recognised as the top performer as I am able to connect dots, stick to plans/deadlines, give new data driven ideas, and i know how to use some softwares my colleges have never worked on ecc… so honestly I thought I was doing fine. But today my manager told me that me being “too much” for the team is a demotivating factor for some older colleges who say they try their best but are not able to reach the new benchmark I have given them and that they feel “humiliated” by my performance. I have never wanted to belittle others work and initially was just excited to get to learn from people with more experience , but most of my colleagues previously worked in other deferments and have no hard skills to be able to do good in their role. It’s a pity for them but I don’t see how it’s my fault. So now I mostly ficus on reaching the goals that the management gives us and “get things done”. However, today my manager told me that even if I am the person they have in mind when there would be an opportunity for promotions, she is worried that in my future I wouldn’t be good at people managing since I am very direct and I apply the same standard of performance to my coworkers as I do to my work so they wouldn’t be able to reach it. She also noted that I make faces in calls when people say stupid things and that for this I am perceived as a bitch.

43,1cyc0hk,AITA for not choosing my parents as godparents for my newborn daughter because they didn't support my choice of legally adopting my step children before?,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (36M) for 2 years and we have been together for a total of 5 years. My husband has 2 daughters from his previous marriage and 3 months ago I gave birth to our first child together. When my husband and I first got together, his daughters were very young and I have been pretty much fully involved in their upbringing ever since we got together. Their mother isn't around so they pretty much view me as their mom and I absolutely view them as my own. We have always been a happy family together from the start.

My parents on the other hand weren't as supportive of my close relationship with my daughters. They always told me that it isn't my job ""to play mommy"" to children that aren't biologically mine. This definitely created a wedge between us because no matter how many times I told them how important they are to my life, they still refused to accept that which I guess they have a right to. My in-laws on the other hand have been supportive of my close relationships with my daughters since day one and they truly make me feel part of the family regardless of whether the children are mine biologically. About a year after my husband and I got married, I brought up the idea of me legally adopting our daughters so that in the extreme case of something happening to my husband,  I would be able to continue taking care of them without having to go through legal troubles. And again my parents were extremely against that idea regardless of my husband and I being married and me pretty much being involved in the girls their entire life.

3 months ago my husband and I had our first daughter together and it in our town it's a tradition to choose godparents for a newborn even though we aren't really religious. My husband and I both agreed that it would be best for his parents to become our daughter's godparents since they have been supportive of our family since the start. When my parents found out we weren't choosing them as godparents, they got upset with us because they felt like they should have been the godparents to their first grandchild. But since they never were supportive of our family I didn't feel like they deserved to demand anything like this.

45,1cybvei,AITA for wanting to split Mom’s birthday bill with siblings ,"Little background and context.  Our mom is a widow, and it’s us 3 siblings.  Its my brother the oldest, my sister is the middle child, then me the youngest. 

Bro’s household consists of 5 (his wife and 2 kids, plus their oldest kid’s gf.) Sis’s household consists of 4 (her husband and 2 kids.)  Then it’s my husband and I, no kids.  My Mom lives with my husband and I, and we support her financially.

Whenever we celebrate birthdays in our family, either my brother, sister, or I will treat the rest of the fam, depending who’s birthday it is.  So for instance, if it’s my husband’s bday, I will take the whole fam out to celebrate and pay for all 12 of us.  If it’s my BIL’s bday, my sister will treat all 12 of us, etc.  For Mom’s birthday or Mother’s Day, my sibs and I will split the bill evenly 3 ways, regardless of each of our household size.  It just made sense, was easy, and just became tradition over the years.  

Flash forward to Mom’s birthday coming up.  We siblings planned for her a fun day out and nice brunch.  Again, the usual 12 of us in total, and the plan was to split the tab 3 ways between us siblings. 

Well, brother contacts me with sudden change of plans.  His son & gf are going on a trip, and won’t be able to make it.  Ok, understandable.  Then he texts me again that now his daughter and wife won’t be coming either, because she has a math test to study for, and his wife needs to take her.  So it’ll just be him now.  Ok, that’s fine too.  Next text is that we shouldn’t split the bill evenly 3 ways because our households are now uneven.mly distributed.  He says it’s just him so he should just pay for himself, and my sister should have to pay for her own husband and kids, and I should only have to pay for my husband and I.  My issue here is that over the years, we never took into account the number of people, we always just split it evenly amongst the 3 of us because we are sharing the experience of taking Mom out for a nice day.  It feels like he is only now bothered by it in this case because the numbers aren’t in his favor this time.  But he never considered it when tables were turned and I was doing that every single time.

At first I agreed because I didn’t want to make him feel awkward.  But then was like eff it, he is the one who made it awkward.  I kindly reminded him that it’s always been an uneven breakdown from my perspective, but that we always have split evenly.  And he rephrases and says that I shouldn’t have to have that burden.  What burden?  I never had an issue with it, and neither did he until now.

Another side note.  Bro and his wife each make well over 6 figures each.  Sis is a stay at home mom, so single income household.  Bro wants to pay for his meal only + his share of Mom’s ($60 total), when if we split it the entire bill 3 ways would be $120 for each sibling.  He’s making a stink over $60.

48,1cybj6d,AITA for calling out my best friend?,"My best friend (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have not been getting along over the last few weeks. I (18F) have been really upset with them and have tried to mediate but it’s not working. My boyfriend has tried cooperate but my best friend hasn’t. She has a slight history with him (they never dated), and I feel she hasn’t given him a proper chance. She believes she has. I feel she has a very set opinion and won’t change it. 

Today, all three of us went to our old junior high to say hello to teachers. She had originally hoped it could be a girls thing, but my boyfriend asked to come along. I asked her and she told me, while she didn’t want him there, if I absolutely wanted him there, I could bring him. I told my boyfriend no. Then, she invited another friend of ours (18M) so she wasn’t third wheeling. I then allowed my boyfriend to come. 

My boyfriend and I arrived in a time when we could talk with teachers for a few minutes. My best friend, however, had some car troubles and got there late. She had originally asked me to pick her up, and I informed her my boyfriend would be with us. She then found another way to get there (I’m assuming she didn’t want to see him).

Then, she invited another friend of ours (18M) so she wasn’t third wheeling. I then allowed my boyfriend to come. 

My boyfriend and I arrived in a time when we could talk with teachers for a few minutes. My best friend, however, had some car troubles and got there late.

51,1cyb2jx,WIBTA if I kept an item an ex-friend left with me?,"(TL;DR at the end)

I’m pretty sure I would be the asshole, but I’m a chronic people pleaser so I always assume I am TA if I upset someone. My friends are on my side but I feel like they just don’t like the ex-friend. 

Some background info: My spouse and I (late 20s GN) were friends with ‘Ann’ (mid 30s F) for a few years and had a lot of fun together, but we struggled with Ann’s mean-girls attitude towards people she thought deserved it. 

My spouse ‘Jin’ tried to talk about it with her several times but it always turned into a fight about how we don’t support her and are attacking her, that we obviously didn’t want to be friends with Ann because we disagreed with her self-destructive choices. I almost always feel I am in the wrong when I upset others, so I stayed quiet often (I’m working on it).
We kind of gave up on changing her viewpoint, and were exhausted by her constant negative energy and complaining.

 Jin works full time, I work and am a student. We stopped making as much time in our schedule to hang out (previously almost every day and went to a couple times a month) with Ann, which pissed her off. It came to a head when she pulled the ‘you don’t want to be friends anymore’ card again over text, and I called because Jin was exasperated and over talking A down.

I tried to explain why we had been hanging out less, and that we did still want to travel with her and be her friends, but was yelled at over the phone for what felt like an hour. I was unable to get words out (people pleasing anxiety again yayyy). She ended the friendship and hung up on me before I could say anything substantial. Jin and Ann work for the same company and are in the same building, but haven’t spoken since. (A year ago)

We have things at her house that we made peace with never seeing again (wasn’t worth the sadness and anger). We have something of hers as well, which she has never asked for. 

This is where I might be the asshole:

Ann gave us her inflatable paddle board to use and never asked for it back (she used it maybe once since buying and we used it every weekend). Today Jin got a message from a coworker that Ann was selling her paddle board and J should bring it to work for the coworker to take. 

My initial reaction was annoyance since we use it all the time, and she couldn’t even ask for it herself. But paddle boards aren’t cheap, and we didn’t buy it from her, so it feels wrong to keep.

She treated us like shit, so I want to say ‘fuck it’ and decline (Jin and friends agreed), but I feel like an asshole for considering it. WIBTA if we ignored her or declined? Or said she had to get it herself if she wanted to sell it?

I’m fully expecting an asshole verdict but my spouse and our friends made me rethink.. which is why I’m asking strangers.

TLDR: Asshole Ex-friend wants to sell expensive item she left with us over a year ago, but won’t talk to us directly. We want to decline. WIBTA?

We’ve become a trio, hanging out, playing games, and chilling together. Susan often asks me and Pete to do things together, and it feels like she’s become a bit of a third wheel. Recently, I've been suffering from headaches and stress, which has made me quieter than usual. Additionally, someone messaged me privately after a gaming session with a larger group, saying I'm too loud and don't leave room for others to talk.

Despite this, I still wanted to play games with Susan and Pete. A couple of days ago, I asked Susan to join us for some games, but she hesitated and agreed only if I didn't go quiet. It felt odd, so Susan explained that she felt awkward and sensed tension when I was quiet. I told her about my headaches and the stress, but she wouldn’t accept that explanation and is now mad at me.

61,1cyad26,AITA for saying I might see a friend the day after my dog's spaying procedure?,"So, I've lived with my long-term boyfriend and our small dog, ""Lola"", for almost 3 years now. We're both in our late twenties. Here's the situation: My boyfriend has arranged Lola's spaying procedure for this week. We decided it would be best for him to schedule it because he has more free time than me, since I work full-time and go to university at night from Monday to Friday, and he is currently unemployed and has no daily time constraints.

He scheduled the procedure for tomorrow, Thursday, on a vet clinic his family trusts a lot, right next to his parents' house on a city that's close by (about an hour from where we live). The vet has advised him to take Lola straight to his parents' house after the surgery, and to stay there with her for at least 7 days, so she has a good and safe recovery. I obviously can't stay there during that time because of work and school, but I would go there during the weekend.

The thing is... My boyfriend is a very anxious person. Lola's spaying is currently causing him to be very anxious, and he is sort of being a little mean to me. Not on purpose, I guess, but I'm dealing with it. Now, I work and study a lot, and have almost no free time to relax or to do anything fun during the week. So, before I knew the surgery was scheduled for tomorrow, I asked my best-friend to go out on Friday night to catch-up and have some fun. I haven't seen my friends in almost a month because I've been too busy, and I would like to chill and gossip and all that. Best-friend hadn't confirmed yet, so even when I knew about the date of the procedure I didn't cancel my invitation, since it wasn't even fully confirmed.

Today I got home from work and my boyfriend asked me in a very matter-of-factly manner ""You'll go straight to my parents' house after work on Friday, right?"", to which I reply ""Well, I might see my best-friend for a little bit after work, she hasn't confirmed yet, but I'm going after that, for sure"". He got really upset about this. He's been accusing me of leaving him alone to take care of Lola after the procedure, of not caring at all for them, and of being selfish for the past hour. He is currently crying in our bedroom and saying he doesn't believe I would go to a bar to have a drink the night after Lola's surgery.

I have to admit that at first I was like ""Well, it's a simple procedure and I'm sure everything will be alright, my boyfriend can take care of a dog by himself for one day and I can get there by Friday night, or Saturday morning, I deserve to have some fun too"", but now I'm wondering... AITA? Should I feel guilty for going out with a friend the night after my dog's spaying?

Since she was still in that room, our parents decided to put in a skylight. While moving out her stuff to do so, young me probably around 11 or 10 invited her to sleep in my room until the light was put in.

My sister hasn’t said anything about it, and always seems to enjoy having them there. I do all the cleaning in the room, including cleaning the art table we supposedly share that she uses more. I clean almost every day, and vacuum as much as possible. I also have hanging Ivy and fairy lights around my side of the room, along with an abundance of pictures of birds.

64,1cy9wng,WIBTA if I confronted my roommate about only paying me $70 in gift cards for taking care of her cat for three months?,"Hi Reddit,

I (23F) live with my roommate (25F). We're generally good friends, and we usually get along well. However, a recent situation has left me feeling pretty upset, and I need some outside perspectives.

Three months ago, my roommate had to leave on a work trip. She asked if I could take care of her cat, while she was gone. I agreed because I wanted to help her out and I thought, ""How hard can it be?"" She assured me she'd compensate me fairly for my time and effort.

The cat is adorable but quite a handful. I clean their litter box daily, refill water and food and give them lots of attention and playtime so they wouldn't get lonely. This adds more responsibility than I was expecting to my daily routine than I initially anticipated. Honestly, after this experience, I've realized I'm not really a cat person anymore lol.

My roommate returned a few days ago and thanked me profusely for taking care of the cat. She handed me an envelope, saying it was my payment. When I opened it, I found $70 in gift cards to various stores and restaurants. I was taken aback because I was expecting actual money.

While I appreciate the gesture, I feel like $70 in gift cards for three months of pet care is inadequate. Considering all the time and effort I put into taking care of the cat, I feel like my contribution wasn't fairly compensated, and the gift cards seem a bit dismissive.

I didn't say anything at the moment because I didn't want to seem ungrateful or strain our friendship, but the more I think about it, the more upset I get, especially because I am in between jobs right now. I feel like my time and effort deserve more recognition, and I'm considering bringing this up with her. However, I'm worried she'll think I'm being petty or ungrateful, especially since we're friends. When I tried talking about it with a mutual friend, she said I was ungrateful and I already lived there so she wasn't sure what the big deal was.

So, AITA for being mad that my roommate paid me $70 in gift cards for taking care of her cat for three months? Should I bring it up with her, or just let it go to avoid potential conflict?

Thanks for your input.

65,1cy9hbj,AITA for attending a wedding on my daughter's birthday?,"Hi Reddit, I'm new to this sub but my son suggested I post here to get a second opinion!

So my(F38) middle daughter (let's call her K) is turning 9 in September. She is really into Sanrio so we are planning to throw her a birthday bash this year complete with a Hello Kitty shaped cake, cupcakes, a bounce house, decor, basically all the works. She is really excited. It is going to be a family friendly party as well so the grandparents are going to drive in (they both live \~3 hours away so we do see them plenty of times per year).

All we had to do was chose the day of the party. It just so happens that her actual birthday falls on the weekend that my best friend (since high school) is getting married. I am in the wedding party and this has been planned for months. I am very excited to go celebrate my friend and her soon to be husband. (Also it is a child-free affair so my kids won't be able to go). I suggested that we host K's birthday party on the weekend after the wedding, but my husband expects me to drop out of the wedding party and host K's birthday on the actual anniversary of her birth.

For context, I am a SAHM (but I run a Shopify store that brings in enough to cover our non-mortgage bills so I do financially contribute to the household). This means I don't have a ton of time to see my girlfriends outside of big events, especially those who aren't also mothers since I don't see them at playdates or school functions.

I don't see any reason why we can't just move her party to the weekend after. On her actual birthday I plan to make chocolate chip waffles with whipped cream and do family presents like always, and then attend my friend's wedding. My husband has me feeling guilty though, like I am a terrible mother for wanting to celebrate K on another day. My parents said that her actual birthday would be a better day for them, but they could still make the weekend after so I don't think it's that big of a deal. I know that I celebrate my birthday on a different day all the time so I don't really understand why my husband is so worked up?

So Reddit, am I the asshole who needs to tell her friend she can't make it anymore?

I'd be pushing it with a late Saturday afternoon flight though, seems risky.

The only person who is mad is my husband.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-22,"AITA for attending a wedding on my daughter's birthday? Hi Reddit, I'm new to this sub but my son suggested I post here to get a second opinion!

So my(F38) middle daughter (let's call her K) is turning 9 in September. She is really into Sanrio so we are planning to throw her a birthday bash this year complete with a Hello Kitty shaped cake, cupcakes, a bounce house, decor, basically all the works. She is really excited. It is going to be a family friendly party as well so the grandparents are going to drive in (they both live \~3 hours away so we do see them plenty of times per year).

All we had to do was chose the day of the party. It just so happens that her actual birthday falls on the weekend that my best friend (since high school) is getting married. I am in the wedding party and this has been planned for months. I am very excited to go celebrate my friend and her soon to be husband. (Also it is a child-free affair so my kids won't be able to go). I suggested that we host K's birthday party on the weekend after the wedding, but my husband expects me to drop out of the wedding party and host K's birthday on the actual anniversary of her birth.

For context, I am a SAHM (but I run a Shopify store that brings in enough to cover our non-mortgage bills so I do financially contribute to the household). This means I don't have a ton of time to see my girlfriends outside of big events, especially those who aren't also mothers since I don't see them at playdates or school functions.

I don't see any reason why we can't just move her party to the weekend after. On her actual birthday I plan to make chocolate chip waffles with whipped cream and do family presents like always, and then attend my friend's wedding. My husband has me feeling guilty though, like I am a terrible mother for wanting to celebrate K on another day. My parents said that her actual birthday would be a better day for them, but they could still make the weekend after so I don't think it's that big of a deal. I know that I celebrate my birthday on a different day all the time so I don't really understand why my husband is so worked up?

I told her we could share it because my coconut icecream was small and i can eat half of hers if she wants. we spent at least 10 minutes arguing because she didn't want to eat it anyway, i proposed to eat it all myself by taking it away and eating it on the way to home, it was too much for one person but at least we would've stopped arguing under the eye of everyone in the restaurant. She said no, because i already ate mine so she didn't want me to eat it. I asked her any solution and she proposed leaving the restaurant without touching it.

I eat it very fast, we leave and in the car she said that i made her feel uncomfortable and that I shouldn't have eaten it because it was _her_ ice cream.

71,1cy8y6o,AITA for not letting my mother in law babysit our daughter?,"Sorry in advance for it being long, but here's a backstory. I, (25 F) and my husband (25 M) have been together for a while. We have been together since we were 14 years old and my relationship with his family has been anything but good to say the least. His mother has never really cared for me and to be quite honest, I have no idea as to what I have done. I have apologized many times even when I know I wasn't wrong. I have put myself in uncomfortable situations for him to keep the peace. Just to name a few things, she told him when we were 18 that she demanded he leave me due to not liking me. She said this too in front of my best friend. She completely ruined our wedding all over her own mistake and instead of owning up to it, she took my wedding dress away from me a few days before our wedding (thankfully, my father in law, who is her ex husband, bought me a wedding dress due to all of our money going to the wedding). She even ruined our baby shower when she was ""not involved"". She was involved, she just didn't care to take everyone else into consideration. 

My husband has always been the silent type and tried to let things go. That is, until right before our daughter was born. We were being induced late at night and we said that we did not want everyone to feel obligated to be at the hospital so late and be uncomfortable. We felt this was reasonable, especially since we have a lot of people in each of our families with health issues and are also older. Well, she told everyone that we told her not to show up and she was unwelcome. Not the case. His family began attacking us over it. It went as far as on family Christmas, his grandmother screamed at me in front of everyone for refusing to let our 2 1/2 month old be passed around after none of them have checked on us and most of them had been sick. Fast forward, our daughter is close to a year old and she has never babysat for us. I will admit, we do not ask. But my husband has his reasons. He says he is uncomfortable due to a lot of childhood trauma she caused as well as she has a major drinking issue and refuses to put the bottle down. It was recently brought to my attention that she has told the whole family about this and my husband is not pleased.

The problem is she is mental about her property. She has a very big area and there is no line from the park to where her property is. If your ball goes over she will come out a tell you to get off her property.

The kids school bus stop is right there and like 40 kids get on in the morning. They all don’t fit on the sidewalk and will stand in the grass. She put a sprinklers and soaked all the kids before school. They were not messing things up.

In the winter she yelled at a group of kids having a snowball fight and they went over the line. It has happened so many time and it has happened when people were still technically in the park. 

I wish she would just put up a fence since it would actually show where it begins. So basically no one in the neighborhood is fond of her. The kids don’t like her, the parents don’t, and even the old lady’s find her to be destroying the peace.

We are suppose it have a block party in about two weeks and I organize it. This year I got a petition to not include her. I also moved it so it would be on the other side of the park so no one would be anywhere near her property.

74,1cy8acg,AITAH EDC Girls Trip Edition ,"So, where do I start! Well in the beginning of course. About 6 months ago a friend of mine invited me to EDC. I had never been to a rave nor Vegas and thought this would be an awesome experience. My friend ensured me that it would be a girls trip multiple times. Promising we would do Vegas and EDC. Upon arrival to our hotel she told me that we would be getting separate rooms, and that her boyfriend was in town with his friends. this was not in the plans and I was not monetarily prepared to pay for my own room, we had planned to split the cost of a single room. She fronted me $500 to cover the cost. 

Fast forward to night one of EDC, worst case scenario we got separated for about 2 hours. After getting cell service I was able to contact my friend and they informed me that they had been waiting for hours and they were at the car ready to go home. I made my way to the car and silence…. I expected a “I’m glad you’re okay we can’t get separated again” but I was in for a surprise. 

When we got back the the hotel she snapped. I asked why bring me if you knew this was how it was going to be, this is when she mocked me saying “because it’s my first rave” in that petty nasty voice I’m sure you can all imagine. That shit really hurt my feelings and I went back to my room. 

The following day I text her asking what were the plans, and there was no response for the full day. This was the last night of EDC and I was hoping we could just put the argument behind us and enjoy our time but no, GHOST! I missed the last night by choice of course but my group had totally left me. 

I checked out early and came home. Checked social media and I was blocked on everything. This morning I get a text saying “Let me know when you can run that $570” 

She’s not getting shit from me.

When we got back the the hotel she snapped. I asked why bring me if you knew this was how it was going to be, this is when she mocked me saying “because it’s my first rave” in that petty nasty voice I’m sure you can all imagine. That shit really hurt my feelings and I went back to my room. 

The following day I text her asking what were the plans, and there was no response for the full day. This was the last night of EDC and I was hoping we could just put the argument behind us and enjoy our time but no, GHOST! I missed the last night by choice of course but my group had totally left me. 

I checked out early and came home. Checked social media and I was blocked on everything. This morning I get a text saying “Let me know when you can run that $570” 

She’s not getting shit from me.

75,1cy78h5,"AITA for being against my friend's ""friendship"" with our professor?","I'm 24F and I have a friend Meg (24F). There's this one professor (60M, Tom) she had a big crush on for two years. She stalked him and his family online and found out where he lives. I told her he might find out about it but she laughed it off. 

We're currently writing our master's theses and Tom is one of the supervisors, so Meg chose him to be hers. She started visiting him during his office hours every week. I noticed something wrong in their relationship. Occassionally he touched her on her shoulder or back, or gave her a hug. At first I thought she is just exaggerating, but then I saw it myself. During classes he was looking at her only, as if he was speaking just to her. He even gave her his phone number in order to text about the thesis, but soon enough they were texting daily as if they were best friends. 

One day Tom bought her quite expensive earrings. That's when she realized their relationship is going in the wrong direction. She was more curt while talking to him. I thought it's finally over, but no... After a week she became obsessed again. That's when I went to a trusted professor who was a close friend of Tom's and explained everything to her. She told me she will speak to him about it, and for quite some time Tom was curt towards Meg as well. 

Then, somewhere around February this year, Meg found out he is a big fan of chess. She asked him to teach her how to play, so they started meeting regularly again. Since that time their relationship grew even stronger, they are still texting and meeting almost everyday after or before lectures. He started walking her home. 

Then situation got complicated last month, when Tom's wife discovered his texts to Meg. She was mad at him and left the house for a couple weeks. Then decided she wants a divorce. At first Tom told Meg that they can't talk anymore, but the very moment his wife left the house he said they can text again. It's so disgusting how both of them can't live without talking to each other. I told Meg that she NEEDS to stop now but she couldn't resist and answered him. They found a website to play chess that allows them to send messages to each other, so they use it instead.

Tom doesn't even hide with touching her ""accidentally"" anymore, even in public. Meg is talking about him only, she even told me how much she would like to have s*x with him one day. It's now May and I just had a really serious conversation with Meg (again) and I told her everything I dislike about her relationship with Tom, and this time she got seriously mad at me.

79,1cy6dou,WIBTA for not continuing to live with my best friend after our lease it up? ,"My friend and I (both almost 30m) have been best friends for over 15 years, and have been living together for 5 years since we can afford a much bigger and nicer place if we split the rent. Our current lease is up in a little over 3 months, and I'm heavily considering just getting a place of my own next.

My friend has been depressed for the last 6 years, it varies in intensity, but can get quite severe. It's recently gotten worse in the last 6 months, and I've been there for him, and tried to do what I can, but the last 5 years living with him have been draining, and I'm now being treated for depression myself. It's not his depression that bothers me, but the fact for the last 6 years he refuses to get any professional help even though he has the means to, and myself, his parents and other friends have told him he needs it. I feel like a monster, and don't plan to stop being friends by any means, but I'm being dragged down too at this point, and I'm honestly a bit resentful that he hasn't even tried to get help in 6 years.

I tried to bring it up, that I was thinking about getting my own place last week, he was in a good place lately, before his latest episode that caused me to post this. He immediately shut the idea down, and said it ""Was stupid, and to get it out of my head because it's not happening"". He basically said I need to learn to deal with being around negativity. And just tell him if what saying bothers me. But it's not just what he says, it's very obvious by his demeanor, and almost everything we talk about outside of just jokes usually has a very negative spin to it. Even if it's not about his own feelings, he just has an extremely negative outlook on the world, and that perimates into lots of other things.

I admit I'm not the easiest to live with sometimes, I can be forgetful of basic things quite frequently. Even I can understand it's annoying. Earlier this year I put a foldable drying rack together wrong, and he reamed me out for that. I might not put stuff away correctly, or leave a mess. I've forgotten the order the dog's food goes in several times, even after being reminded. (different flavor for morning and evening since Shiba's are picky, no medical reason)

However, today we got into a big fight because I will be visiting my home town near the end of the month and plan to go to my Dads house where my stepmom, who she hates, will be present. 

Back story, last year my sister was kicked out of the house by my stepmom due to a huge disagreement about what was fair to be paying in rent. This escalated into name calling and terrible things said that can never be taken back by both my sister and stepmom. My sister essentially was facing homelessness, and had to scramble to find somewhere to live last minute. My Dad is extremely passive and never picked sides, which caused a huge rift between my sister and him as well. However last month, we went on a bonding vacation with just my Dad and sister and everything was mostly worked through, although my sister still holds some resentment towards my Dad for not taking up for her during this time. During the entire ordeal, I sided with my sister and even booked an emergency flight home to help her move and figure out a living situation.

This made her even more upset and she started crying, saying that it’s more than dislike and our stepmom betrayed her in a way that no one ever has, and that me even being cordial sends a message that her actions have no repercussions and that what she did isn’t that bad because I am not cutting her off.

In January this year she left her job to finish school with a mandatory unpaid placement. I have also been in school for the past 2 years and had to take an unpaid placement at the same time. I just finished mine and returned to work but she had to quit her job as hers is 8 months long. We saved up for a while to live while neither of us had an income. We have run into some unexpected financial problems so we need more of an income than just mine. Her placement is only about 20 hours a week whereas mine was 30 and I had an additional course to complete. We have talked about her finding a part- time job to supplement our income since she has a lot of extra time. She initially agreed. A job opportunity came up that was in her field, she is highly qualified l, it only required 8 hours a week, and paid $85.00 an hour which is more than double what either of us has every made. It could not have been better. She said she would apply. The posting expired 3 weeks later. She didn’t apply. I know that she has been ambivalent about finding work during her placement but we’ve talked about this and I thought we had an understanding. When I asked her why she didn’t, she said that she wouldn’t get another opportunity to have so much downtime so she wants to take advantage of it. We work in a stressful field and we have both sustained occupational mental health injuries because of it so I totally understand. I know this is subjective but I think the rest period for the past 4 months has gone on too far. She’s taken out a line of credit, already has thousands of dollars on it, and my income alone barely is barely getting us by each month.  My next 3 months of pay checks are already spoken for to pay debts. I would love and probably need to step back from work but I can’t because I have to support us.

Her placement is only about 20 hours a week whereas mine was 30 and I had an additional course to complete. We have talked about her finding a part- time job to supplement our income since she has a lot of extra time. She initially agreed. A job opportunity came up that was in her field, she is highly qualified l, it only required 8 hours a week, and paid $85.00 an hour which is more than double what either of us has every made. It could not have been better. She said she would apply. The posting expired 3 weeks later. She didn’t apply. I know that she has been ambivalent about finding work during her placement but we’ve talked about this and I thought we had an understanding. When I asked her why she didn’t, she said that she wouldn’t get another opportunity to have so much downtime so she wants to take advantage of it. We work in a stressful field and we have both sustained occupational mental health injuries because of it so I totally understand. I know this is subjective but I think the rest period for the past 4 months has gone on too far. She’s taken out a line of credit, already has thousands of dollars on it, and my income alone barely is barely getting us by each month.  My next 3 months of pay checks are already spoken for to pay debts. I would love and probably need to step back from work but I can’t because I have to support us. She spends her days puttering around the house, walking the dog, and watching tv when she’s not doing her placement (which is 90% virtual).

83,1cy5qhy,AITA for threatening to Keep an old friends cat if she doesn't pay me back?,"So this situation is frustrating and stressful so please forgive any typos!

Back in March 2024, an old family friend reached out to see if I can house her cat for a while so she can get back on her feet. She couldn't bring her cat with her to her temp housing arraignment and didn't want to surrender her cat. We came up with an agreement that if I take in her cat, she will have to send me money for her necessities (Cat food and cat litter) and money to pay for her housing as I rent my home. She agreed to this and also said that she has a litter box, litter, food, cat bowls, cat carrier, and a cat water fountain.

When we arrived, NOTHING was ready to go and the cat and several other cats were going inside and outside of the home. There was no cat carrier, litter box, food or litter. the only thing we got was the cat, bowls and water fountain( I also want to include that I had to get a new water fountain as the one she gave me was full of cat s\*\*t, I made her aware of this before I bought one). I should have taken this as my sign to say never mind I can't as this should have been very clear to me with what I was getting into. But I didn't

Because there was no food or litter like she promised to send with us, she said she would pay us money the next week when she got paid and we agreed to this. I had to go on a late run to a corner store to get a small package of food and litter(this would only last for like a day)  for the cat and then the next day I got food that would last longer and more litter too, and the water fountain. I texted her the total of all this so she knew what to send the following week and she turned around and asked ME to send her money to pay off her cash-app debt. I told her absolutely not and was shocked that she had the audacity to ask me that. she insisted she'd pay it back and wasn't asking for money (literally was).

Each week since, she would change the day she would be able to send money and now she owes even more. It has been about two months since and she owes even more now than before.. I had enough of this song and dance with her.

I texted her that if she doesn't pay me what she owes she has these options.

1. She can pay me in full by the 31st and she can come get her cat after I get the money
2. If no payment is made by the 31st then I will keep the cat and block her

or a third option that could help her get back on her feet and allow both parties to be happy:

3. She pays me $50 a month to go towards what she owes and the cat necessities. She currently owes me $230. This may not seem like a lot to everyone but it is to me.

I feel like option 3 is far more graceful than the others and could allow her room to breathe. I am trying to take into consideration that she has a child she is taking care of and I don't want to put her in a bind either.

She says I'm TA for calling her a liar and threatening to steal her cat. A few friends and family say I'm in the right and being nicer than I should while others say I'm the jerk.

AITA?

  
just a small update: after speaking with a few people on here, I'm going to present her this idea 

1. she takes her cat back now and I forgive the amount owed 

or

2. I keep the cat and forgive the amount owed. 

  
its becoming more and more clear that I cannot expect any form of payment so regardless I'm at a loss. at the end of the day this cat will be well taken care of while in my care.

I (45M) own a house and a decent chunk of land in Montana.

When he got the chair he asked his gf who is currently my roommate to get it home , though I offered to pay for it to be delivered as I alr felt like I was asking too much of them .
They told me that the price of the chair doubled as the person who was giving it to him asked for more money to which I agreed because it seemed fair. But when I got the chair I found out it was beyond filthy and broken though I checked with them about the condition of the chair before paying and they assured me it was working well .I didn’t have any other option but to call the friend and inform him about it and ask for a solution to it . Doing it all kept making me feel very uncomfortable because I kept feeling i am asking too much of them and I should just go deal with it . 
Day before yesterday that friend came to meet his gf and got extremely passive aggressive with me , kept making snide remarks about helping me out and while trying to fix and clean the chair . He threw the dirty towel in my face after he was done cleaning despite me again telling him that I would do this and I just needed his help to fix the chair because my mom paid for it and she wanted to see the chair asap. I feel like I shouldn’t have asked for more help or informed him that the chair was broken because their treatment made me feel like I was the asshole there and not appreciating them getting the chair .

I also invited a long-time guy friend, and I asked if he can give me a ride (he accepted).  The friends' gathering was going extremely well, and everyone was having fun.  However, as we were leaving, a couple of my friends had asked if I and my guy friend will ever start dating.  I told them that I don't even like him.  My guy friend heard this, and it appeared it hurt him as he was very quiet while he was driving me home.  The next day, all of my friends are telling me that I should date him (they all think he is a great guy, and I agree he is a very sweet person), but I made it clear that I am not interested.  I texted my guy friend that we shouldn't hang out anymore as I don't want my friends to suspect that we are trying to get together, and I told him that I am not interested in a relationship.  He respected my decision not to pursue a relationship, although he did say that he will miss hanging out with everyone.  I tried texting him the next day, and he blocked me.  I even texted his parents, and they didn't reply back either.  Wondering if I had upsetted him by telling him that we should no longer hang out.

93,1cy44te,AITA for rejecting my aunt’s health advice and bringing up an embarrassing story?,"I (27F) recently went to my grandfather’s 80th birthday. I’m currently undergoing chemo for an autoimmune disease and have been experiencing nausea and gastrointestinal problems as a result of it. I even debated not going because I had been feeling sick, but it’s such a big milestone that I decided to at least show up for a little bit, congratulate, and leave again if it got too much.

The birthday was a fairly large get together (probably around 100 people) and we celebrated at a hotel who catered the event. We had assigned seating and I was sat amongst other people with my aunt (54F) and her date (??M.) My aunt noticed that I wasn’t eating much and asked me how I was doing, so I explained to her what was going on. Now my aunt is kind of an alternative health nut and I guess took this as an opportunity to sell me on her most recent fad. I told her I wasn’t keen, but she was persistent. It ended up being something about only eating food that’s naturally tan in color(?) and how it’s been known to cure anything from foot fungus to cancer and would probably help with my nausea and maybe even cure my autoimmune disease. 

After begrudgingly letting her tell me all about how medical science can't be trusted and how this could save my life I told her I wasn’t really that desperate yet and made a joking comment about how her ""health tips” have had some... unfortunate outcomes in the past. Her date seemed intrigued about this and asked me to give some examples. He had scoffed at her advice to me as well, so I guess he was interested in what sort of nonsense his date had fallen for in the past. 

I explained how there were several infamous stories about my aunt, but that the one I was thinking of specifically was when several years ago she somehow got the idea that cleaning her bladder with ginger tea would help get rid of UTIs. She bought a catheter online and boiled some tea that she then inserted into her bladder. She swore it worked and proudly told us of it at the time, but I guess one time she forgot to let the tea cool and she scalded her urethra and bladder and had to go to the ER and explain to them how she’d regularly insert tea into her bladder to cure UTIs. She ended up needing I.V. pain meds and antibiotics (because apparently there was significant risk of sepsis from this as well.)  It’s the type of story that gets brought up regularly in my family and usually everyone, including my aunt, can have a good laugh reminiscing. Her date also seemed entertained by the story, laughing along with it as it unfolded. 

When I got home later my mom called and told me that she had spoken to my aunt (her sister) and that she was really embarrassed about what I told her date and how it was inappropriate to bring up. It really wasn’t my intention to embarrass her, she’s pretty steadfast and unashamed about her beliefs so I didn’t think this would bother her, but my mom insisted I “should have known better” so AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-22,"AITA for rejecting my aunt’s health advice and bringing up an embarrassing story?

94,1cy4343,AITA in this catsitting situation? ,"To preface this post,  my best friend and I have been friends for nearly a decade. I plan on calling her to address this situation later today to just resolve things because I think this whole mess is stupid. Btw, she's in Vegas at a music festival and I'm in NYC, so there's 3 hours of time difference.

  
I was supposed to catsit for my bestie on Friday but she asked if I could switch from Friday to Monday because her friend who lives nearby was gonna check in on the cat. I agreed. I texted her Sunday night to confirm that I’d be stopping by the next day. So I get to her apartment (about 1.5 hours from where I live) and call my bestie. It takes her about 30 mins to answer. So she finally answers and tells me that her friend took the keys that she keeps underneath her doormat with her on Friday so I have no way of getting in. She tells me her aunt allegedly has a spare key. Bestie tries calling her aunt. She doesn’t answer so she tells me to knock on the door. The aunt lets me in and tells me that she told my bestie on Saturday that her friend who came by ended up taking the key and tells me that my bestie owes me big time for not communicating this to me. Mind you, my bestie was on the other line for the entire convo I had with her aunt. 

Once I left her aunt's apartment, I called my bestie back to share what her aunt told me. She starts telling me, ""Oh, I tried FaceTiming you and my aunt during that conversation and neither of you picked up."" She also claims that her aunt didn't ""definitively"" tell her that her friend took the keys. She claimed that her aunt said her friend ""probably"" took the keys with her the she came by. I tried explaining to her that it would have been more practical to tell me that information in advance. 

By this point I was annoyed that my bestie didn’t relay the info to me and made me make an unnecessary 3 hr (total) commute. She and I had a 25 minute heated phone and she didn’t own up to not communicating efficiently. She tried blaming me for not picking up her facetime call while I was speaking to her aunt and blamed her aunt for not answering her calls. First off, it’s no one else’s responsibility to open her (best friend's) apartment door for other people who are essentially strangers. I don't even think her aunt even has a spare key because she didn't attempt to mention it or offer to open the door for me. I think this was just some type of excuse my bestie made to avoid culpability.

I don't know it was so hard to just admit that she forgot to tell me that her friend took the key. But the whole pointing her finger at everyone else and blaming them for her mistake along with claiming that the messages she ""tried"" to send me didn't go through just rubbed me the wrong way.

97,1cy3o20,AITA for wanting to be “backstage mom” at my stepdaughter’s dance recital during her mom’s custodial time?,"I have been taking my 9yo stepdaughter to dance classes for four years. I drive her every week. My husband (her dad) and I pay for every single fee associated with her dance school. 

This year, her end-of-year recital lands on her mother’s custodial time. Her mom has committed to taking her to the show.

I volunteered to be the backstage parent (managing the class backstage when they’re not performing, helping with hair and makeup, etc). I did this for the last two recitals and my stepdaughter loves having me there to hang out and support her. 

The dance school reached out yesterday to tell me that my stepdaughter‘s mother asked them to remove me as backstage parent and put her in. They agreed to do it without discussing it with me first because she basically told them it was her custodial right. (To be clear, nothing in their court order says anything that would prevent me from being able to be around her even though she’s not in dad’s custody.)

Mom and I have a history of high conflict. I believe she is trying to remove me because she doesn’t want me spending any extra quality time with her daughter. She simply hates me and my husband. (If you are wondering, I have nothing to do with why she and my husband never worked out). 

I could bow out and accept this because I’m not the biological parent, but it breaks my heart because I love being there and dance is “my thing” with my stepdaughter. 

WIBTA if I reminded the school who their paying customer is and ask them to go back on the decision and advocate for me? I want to fight back and give them all the context so they can understand why I have the right to be there. But I also don’t want more conflict with mom, who would be upset if the school has my back. (If you are wondering, I don’t think she would go to the lengths of not taking her to the recital over this, because she has to know that would be devastating to her daughter who’s worked hard to prepare for her performance.) 

I’m not sure what the best way for all of this to play out would be.

Thank you so much for your judgments! I’m all ears!


Update:  

I called the dance school, but not to have them change their decision. I gave them all the context. (I should’ve clarified in my OP that she lied to them and implied I wasn’t legally allowed to be there on her time which is not true). The owner of the school says he feels completely manipulated by her mom. He apologized. He offered to make it right and said he and his wife (co-owner) were comfortable with reaching out to mom and telling her that I am the backstage mom. They also said it would never happen again. 

I told them that I really appreciated that they are owning up to how it went down. But I told them that I would rather take the high road and leave it at that. I told them not to reach out to mom. Let her have it. I also apologized to them for having to deal with drama that should’ve been handled by our family privately.

The only thing that matters to me is that my stepdaughter has a wonderful experience. I could’ve “won” this, but if that would’ve created even an inkling of stress for my SD on her big day, it wouldn’t be worth it.

My plan is to tell my SD “hey I know I said I’d be backstage this year but great news, your mom wants to do it! You guys will have so much fun together. I’m glad she will be there for you.”
Then I’ll be in the audience with a bouquet of flowers and a huge smile on my face.

WIBTA if I reminded the school who their paying customer is and ask them to go back on the decision and advocate for me? I want to fight back and give them all the context so they can understand why I have the right to be there. But I also don’t want more conflict with mom, who would be upset if the school has my back. (If you are wondering, I don’t think she would go to the lengths of not taking her to the recital over this, because she has to know that would be devastating to her daughter who’s worked hard to prepare for her performance.) 

I’m not sure what the best way for all of this to play out would be.

Thank you so much for your judgments! I’m all ears!


Update:  

I called the dance school, but not to have them change their decision. I gave them all the context. (I should’ve clarified in my OP that she lied to them and implied I wasn’t legally allowed to be there on her time which is not true). The owner of the school says he feels completely manipulated by her mom. He apologized. He offered to make it right and said he and his wife (co-owner) were comfortable with reaching out to mom and telling her that I am the backstage mom. They also said it would never happen again. 

I told them that I really appreciated that they are owning up to how it went down. But I told them that I would rather take the high road and leave it at that. I told them not to reach out to mom. Let her have it. I also apologized to them for having to deal with drama that should’ve been handled by our family privately.

The only thing that matters to me is that my stepdaughter has a wonderful experience. I could’ve “won” this, but if that would’ve created even an inkling of stress for my SD on her big day, it wouldn’t be worth it.

My plan is to tell my SD “hey I know I said I’d be backstage this year but great news, your mom wants to do it! You guys will have so much fun together. I’m glad she will be there for you.”
Then I’ll be in the audience with a bouquet of flowers and a huge smile on my face.

Thanks to everyone here, even the assholes lol",2.0,1.0212275981903076,1,0
98,1cy3kpv,AITA for changing my hairstyle?,"I (14F) am going to camp this summer. It’s going to be very hot and I have  long, thick hair. My little sister (10F) is also going to camp. My mom is very much against me cutting or dying my hair. However, I really didn’t want to deal with my long hair over this summer, so I cut it. Nothing drastic, I cut it to a bit below my shoulders (it was at mid back before). 

When my mom found out, she was pissed. She said that she paid a lot of money for my hair (which is true, she makes me bleach is blonde about once or twice a year). She said that I was undermining her authority and “ruining my pretty hair”.  I yelled at her and told her she was being a bitch over something that wasn’t a big deal. She’s threatening to not let me go to summer camp over my hair cut, which I think is completely ridiculous, but maybe I’m in the wrong?

ETA: she pays upwards of 300 dollars on my hair getting it bleached and it just got done two months ago, it’s quite a bit of money

My sil has court this week to get her older two kids back from their dad after their dad proved she was neglecting them. Well I was supposed to watch the baby while she went tocourt. The primary babysitter called me though to warn me she has dfs at her house all the time now because sil was reported for neglect of the baby due to a bad diaper rash and bruises and sil claimed the babysitter was abusing her child. So, since my sil likes to blame everyone else I have decided to back out of babysitting my niece. I properly care for my child so I know if dfs shows up at my door everything would be unfounded however it could impact my career.

This was fine, however, we all realised that H was beginning to act like E (H used to be genuine and caring).

My friends and I started taking uni more seriously so whenever we met up, it gradually became study sessions. 

We were planning to go to a restaurant as a group, two of them discussed where to go when the rest of us weren't active and decided on a high end restaurant. I raised concerns to my other friends who I were closer to and they felt the same, it was too expensive. We talked to E about it and she expressed there was no point in going anymore, we tried suggest other restaurants that were more budget friendly but after her response, everything became awkward. She became quiet and upset. We found out that she went with other people which was fine but she told them we were dismissing her opinions.

I had already previously forgot most of the old until he came to look for me again explaining how there was another talent show. He told me this around two or three weeks before the talent show auditions  and I had already previously forgot most of the old song. 

Cut to the audition since I had forgotten the song, I messed up a good amount of times. The teacher recommended him to do a solo performance, and I told him he could do it solo and it was ok with me. (Note after auditions we had 6 weeks to prepare for the actual rehearsal). Around 3 weeks after the auditions he texted me, he basically told me he basically had the song we were gonna preform done and how he didn’t want to do it solo. Me being a friend who is understanding I agreed to do it. 

I spent a whole night re-learning the song and even around two nights learning the big solo for the song. He came over to my place to practice together and stuff. Cut to the day of the final rehearsal, and everyone went and it was our turn. I had the solo down but near the end of the solo, I screwed up, the teacher went on a rant on how he should have gone solo and that we weren’t on time. He basically didn’t talk to me after that.

An hour or so later I chose to check up on him here he basically said “What happened.” Him
“ How you feeling” me 
“Idk Good question” him 
And he continued to basically put it on me for apparently not knowing it at 100%, and that he could have done it solo if I told him, but remember that he looked for me.   have chosen to ignore him for the moment, I haven’t talked to him and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong I really need your guys opinion

On Sunday when I woke up, the whole family was already up and reading or playing video games. After a few hours of cleaning and mowing the lawn, no one had said anything to me yet.

He later texted to suggest I just pick something up from Costco, but I was driving and didn't see it.

We ended up at an Asian buffet (which he likes and I tolerate). On the way home from dinner, 1 kid started pouting that it was unfair that I got Mother's Day and my birthday but there was no kid's day. She said it's unfair that I get celebrated twice.

So I '21/F' has & always been close to my sister '30/F' and her boyfriend which is now her husband, '32/M.'

(Please be patient with my English as this isn't my first language.)

My sister has a boyfriend, let's call him, Ly. My sis and Ly has been together for god knows when. As like I said, me and my sis are 9 years apart so I was just an elementary student when she's already in college. Ly used to visit our house a lot, and so me as a child, just also get used to his presence and naturally becomes close to him. 

He naturally becomes a family in my eyes as I often see him. Plus the fact that he's also kind, and fun to be with. 

So yea, years later, which is now, my sis and ly are already married. They live in our house as theirs aren't yet finished. All is good, we are still close and everything's normal.

But last night, my sis & ly came from work. I was eating then when Ly suddenly grab the water I took from the refrigerator for myself and am suppose to drink. He just grabbed it, smiled, then continued walking to their room.

I frowned and my sister saw it so she said, ""It's just a water, just take another one again."" 

But I, as a response, ""How foolish! The ref is literally just 3 steps away!"" said in a whining tone and rolled my eyes. Tho ly might not have seen/heard it as he's already in his way to their room, my sister did and while I didn't even meant anything by that, I think she took it personally.

It was literally just a sudden response for my b-i-l sudden action so my words was nothing but words without a thought but for some reasons my sis took offense and asked me to apologize. 

I don't know. I also don't understand myself but I am hurt. Why am I asked to apologize for reacting the way I did? 

Sis said that my b-i-l was just being playful, she also added that she never even experienced the treatment I gave to my b-i-l at the side of his family so why did I treated him that way. She also said that if it's us who asks for favor to my b-i-l, my b-i-l never complains so why did I, for just small matters, acted that way. And that's she's starting to see my true colors. She even said that's she's really disappointed. 

But what I don't understand is why she's reacting as if I did something really horrible? Was I really that disrespectful? I really didn't meant anything when I said what I said, it was just my sudden reaction without a thought but why is she making me feel that I made a huge mistake? 

She even told me that we don't have to speak to each other again, and I said okay out of spite because I am hurt. But I kind of regret that. 

I really don't understand. I'm hurt and confused. So AITA?

PS. My sister is pregnant. So I'm confused whether I was really rude or it was just her hormones talking. Please enlighten me.

(Please be patient with my English as this isn't my first language.)

My sister has a boyfriend, let's call him, Ly. My sis and Ly has been together for god knows when. As like I said, me and my sis are 9 years apart so I was just an elementary student when she's already in college. Ly used to visit our house a lot, and so me as a child, just also get used to his presence and naturally becomes close to him.

106,1cy1fd0,AITA for telling my mom and mother in law they won’t be able to keep my daughter anymore?,"AITA for telling my mom and mother in law they will not longer get to keep my kid

Update: thank you all for your feedback. We are looking forward to preschool so as to clear up the scheduling issues. My mother and mother in law are both lovely. And we are beyond grateful that they donate their time to caring for our child. Like any child/parent relationship, it becomes strained when we are constantly around each other. Neither my wife or I have very many friends in our area, so nuclear family is heavily relied upon. The takeaway is that my wife and I know how not to act when confronted with this situation 25 years from now with our daughter and grandchild/children. 

AITA? We (27m & 26f) have a 3 year old daughter whose after school care is almost completely dependent on my (M) mom and mother in law. They are the ones to pick her up and keep her until we get off work around 5 and pick her back up. My mom mostly doesn’t care when she has her and how long she has her, as long as it’s mostly balanced evenly so all of the work for caring for our kid isn’t put on just one person. 

My MIL, on the other hand, tracks time practically to the minute; every minute she has her needs to be a minute my mom has her, so as to be “fair”. Our solution for the past year has been to come up with a monthly calendar oh who has her, when, and for how long. It works pretty well for the most part. 

The root of this post are for the one-off times that my MIL keeps my daughter. Say we’re over at their house for dinner and we run to the store because we need eggs. We leave our daughter for 10-15 minutes to we can run to the store and come back to finish dinner. Well- those 15 minutes are then tallied up and must be matched by my parents or else everything isn’t fair. Or we go out of town all together as a family. One day we all go to a children’s museum. Because my MIL was involved with helping out with her, the time spend at the children’s museum is then tallied up and must be matched. 

This ultimately leads to me and my wife arguing because parents are both “whispering in our ears” so to speak. 

I told both parents that, while it is a tremendous help that they are keeping her for after school hours, it will ultimately end with them not being allowed to help if all they want to do is argue about the time they keep her. 

A few notes: childcare is insanely expensive, so this is definitely helping us save money. However, the reason she is not in full time daycare is because both my parents and my wife’s parents begged us to let them keep her spitting the time between them. 

No, we don’t pay them to watch her. We do plenty for them to make up for their time. 

If they aren’t able to keep her for a day, one of us just takes off work and keeps her. 

ETA: Routine childcare would be arranged through other means. Grandparents would definitely still get to see her, I just wouldn’t place all after school care on them. Them being the primary source of after school care was their idea, and we didn’t object because they are family and it would help us out financially. That decision was made when she was like 8 months old. Now that she’s older, we are in a different financial position and could afford to send her to after school care, but my parents and in-laws feel like that would be us taking away their privileges.

I don’t remember exactly what I said but I do remember my mom yelling at me to stop being aggressive and saying “Whats wrong with you?!” in which I responsed, “He thinks he’s funny and he’s not!”.

108,1cy13tu,WIBTA if I moved on with my life,"
About five years ago, I lived in a completely different city. I was living with a close family member, and I was saving money to move out in addition to helping around the house (such as buying groceries, paying bills, etc). The city (and surrounding area) is very expensive. I was slowly giving up and considered moving to a different city. Then, the close family member mentioned a city that would be wonderful. I took trips with them a few times over to this city to take a look. The family member expressed that they also would like to move there. It has so much potential, and it is something that is affordable to me (plus I want to own animals that I previously could not where I lived such as a horse or chickens). 

I was moseying around on Indeed and applied for a job. Unexpectedly, I got the job. I moved in a matter of a week. The family member proposed an idea. They had said that we could pool both of our funds and buy something much bigger and better than to buy individually. I entertained the idea, and for a total of almost three years, I often (think every other weekend) went to house tours with a real estate agent. At least two times, we found an amazing home that hit all the criteria. However, the close family member seems uncertain or indecisive about moving (and by the time they decide, another offer from another buyer is already set in). I even suggested the idea of buying two vacants lots beside each other and building on it (so they can build their home at a later date when she is ready). However, they declined or seemed uninterested. 

I recently went to one of these homes that we really liked. The family member even called another relative about how much she likes it. Yet, it seems like they are uncertain again (despite them expressing about moving and how they cannot afford to live where they were at now). I am starting to get a little upset. It feels like I am putting my life on pause for someone else that doesn't know what they want.

There’s basically a small table a couple metres away from the TV, and she said she has to study right there… She could study in her room, in the kitchen and literally in the office room we have in our house. But she has to sit RIGHT in front of the TV, which leads to me and my older sister not being able to play. So when me and my older sister were trying to play yesterday we had to mute the sound on the TV and had to be quiet so we didn’t disturb our sister. 

She sits there every time she studies and she studies a lot. So if she is the one sitting there first, me and my older sister cannot play on the TV, and if it’s me and my older sister who are sitting there first she still manages to make us mute the TV and be quiet (and she just nags and tells us to go away). 

I have told my parents that it’s really damn annoying lol, but they side with her and say that ”studying is prioritized and more important”. Well, my dad at least has tried to tell her that she cannot study there but she doesn’t listen, so he just sides with her.

I (18F) am in a friend group with 5 other girls (all also 18F) who all want to go on holiday together. We have been looking at different holidays for a while now and it has proved tricky to finding a hotel that will work for all of us. I have taken it upon myself to try and organise this holiday for various reasons.

For some background information there are two girls in our friend group (lets call them Naomi and Alice) who continually argue with each other and just don’t seem to get on, they are usually civil but recently they have got in a huge argument. The argument isn’t really relevant to the situation but all you need to know is that whilst Naomi was willing to try and resolve the argument Alice is not and is refusing to speak with Naomi.

This has made things very tense within the friend group as obviously we cannot hangout with both Naomi and Alice. And has also made things tricky when trying to book a holiday. Before I knew about the argument I had sent a text to the group outlining details of a hotel and flights that would work for us, everyone in the group replied confirming they were interested and wanted to come except for Alice. I reached out to Alice personally after finding out about the argument and asking her if she was okay and if she still wanted to come away with us. She said that she would have liked to come away but money was an issue and she didn’t want to talk to Naomi. I said that this was fair enough and that we could maybe organise something another time to which she seemed excited about.

Fast forward a few weeks and the group meets up to book the holiday without Alice. Alice found out we had met up and asked why she wasn’t invited, I told her that we were booking a holiday and she has said she wouldn’t like to come. She seemed very annoyed and told me she had never said that she didn’t want to come. When I showed her the messages where she had said that she didn’t want to come away she told me that I ‘hadn’t been clear’ and she thought that it was just a passing comment I had made not a genuine question. She complained that I hadn't even shown her the details of the holiday but I had sent them to everyone weeks prior and she had ignored me.

I am also confused as to why she would want to come away with the group anyway. she is not speaking to Naomi, she is also arguing with another one of the girls and also now has an issue with me, it seems as thought this would make the whole holiday experience extremely tense and uncomfortable. 

we have booked the holiday so there is no way for us to invite her now anyway and even if there was we probably wouldn't as it would honestly ruin the holiday for us.

I do feel like I am the asshole though for not being clear and booking the holiday without informing her so please let me know.

I sat them down and asked if they were going to name their daughter Kerra. They told me it was in the running. I asked if they were naming her after anyone and it was a no. That they just liked the name. I told them I am not very confortable with them doing that. I know I don’t own a name and suggested it could be a middle name and we would just call her her first name. I explained it would be very hard for us and we worry that we may start projecting or it will cause mental distress to use.That I don’t think it is fair to the kid to have that burden. 

My husband also said that he wouldn’t be that happy with the decision and feels wrong to name her that.

After that it started agruement, that she is pissed we are trying to veto a name and called us jerk. 

My husband and I don’t know if we are jerks or not. We thought we handled this well and communicated clearly our feelings on it.",0.0,1.0189993381500244,1,0
112,1cy09dj,AITA for asking a neighborhood kid if he could read?,"Yesterday, I (45M) observed a neighborhood teenage boy trespassing on my property. I decided to say something to him as this is not the first time and we have signs posted (PRIVATE PROPERTY NO TRESSPASSING). There are 2 signs posted, at both ends of a temporary dirt accessway used by landscaping and construction vehicles. I observed the teen jogging up the accessway from 1 house away, while walking my dogs.

  
My wife (42F) was also with me and she knows him better than I do. My wife got his attention by yelling, from 1 house away: ""HEY \[name\]! You know you're not supposed to be on there! What are you doing?"" to which the boy shrugged and said he ""didn't know"". I chimed in with ""did you see the signs?"", to which he replied ""yes"". I followed with ""And you \*CAN\* you read, right?"", the boy confirmed he could and I continued with ""then you should know you can't be on there - that's our yard, not public space - please don't cut through our yard.""

  
The boy was out jogging, and with our message made clear my wife and I didn't see the point in taking it any further, so we said goodbye and the boy jogged off. The boy's mother (40's F) was walking down the street toward us immediately after the boy jogged off. My wife and the boy's mother are neighborhood friends (a friend group of ladies that does social events like concerts, brunch, parties, etc. but that's about it).

  
The boy's mother asked my wife what happened because she either heard or saw us talking to her son. My wife explained the situation and the mother said she didn’t know the accessway wasn’t public property and doubled down saying she and her family used it all the time.

  
At this point, I had already said goodbye started walking back to the house with the dogs, as the ladies talked - and I needed to get the dogs home.

  
Around an hour later, I got a social media message from the father (40s M) asking me to call him. I called the father and he asked me what happened, so I relayed the story, as above, what happened, what was said, how it ended, etc. The father proceeded to tell me that I was a ""dick"" to his son and I shouldn't have said anything to the boy - instead I should have called the father and he would have ""handled it"". I reiterated my points to the father that the accessway on our property is temporary for construction access only, there are signs posted, our social media posts, the HOA letter, etc. how the boy admitted to seeing them and ignored them anyway - and why I said what I said as a light-hearted way to say ""stay off our property"". The father came back with ""..if you want to be a dick to a kid, then that says a lot about who you are..."" This went back and forth a few times, me repeating my points and wondering why the father wanted to talk in the first place - and the father calling me a ""dick"" for saying what I did to his son.

113,1cy06so,"AITAH for wearing jewelry (I picked out) that was paid for by my ex husband, but not given as gifts?","I have a favorite pair of earrings that I picked out, and my ex husband paid for.

We have been divorced for some years now and they are still my favorite earrings. There's no sentiment behind them, he simply paid for them.

I have an old ring which I don't wear, and told my current that I wanted to gift it to my daughter eventually (my ex is her dad). My current let me know that he wouldn't feel comfortable with me wearing the ring, which I do understand. I have not worn it once since the split. It's not an engagement ring, but is a similar style (was worn on right hand).

I asked him if he felt weird about my earrings, and explained how the ex paid, but I picked out and they weren't a gift. He said it's fine.



Cleaning out the basement (current lived here with his ex before we were together) and there's some flower vases. I asked him if he knew which ones were from flowers he bought his ex. I want to keep a few, but need to get rid of some. I figured I would get rid of the ones that had flowers for his ex.

This didn't sit well with him. He brought up my jewelry. Asked how it's different. I explained how these vases came from him, to someone else, as a surprise/gift/sentiment to their relationship.

I feel like my earrings are different. I asked him if he would also like me to get rid of everything I brought into the relationship, because mostly everything was paid for by my ex (clothing, shoes, curling iron) as I was a SAHM most of that relationship.

To me, sentiment is completely different from the money.

I didn't mean anything when I asked about the vases, I was just using that as my way to figure out what to keep and what to toss. **I** would be using the vases. **I** wear the earrings that were purchased by someone else. He would never touch either of these things.

So, AITA for looking at this comparison as apples to oranges, or am I just being selfish/difficult? Is **HE** TAH for making this comparison? I honestly feel like he said it just because we talked about the ring shortly beforehand. I asked him myself if the earrings bothered him and explained how there was no meaning ever behind them, even while with the ex. He said he didn't care about me wearing them.

  
Edit for clarification: Jewelry convo happened the day before vases. We haven't had issues like this before, we don't have common issues of bringing up exes. Some vases were grandmothers. We got to the vases while cleaning out basement, he stated he didn't care which we kept, so I asked which he bought for his ex (the only one's that he would have bought in the bunch) and if we could just pitch those ones.

Thank you to everyone who responded! 


I ’m a stay-at-home mom (43F), and I’ve been trying to teach my kids basic life skills, including tidiness and organization. One of my pet peeves is finding dirty socks inside out in the laundry. I’ve asked my son multiple times to put them right side out, but he continues to ignore my request. This morning as I was starting to load the washer I had to turn every one of my sons socks as they were all inside out.

 I made a comment about how I hate flipping the socks around and told my husband to please talk to him when he gets home from school since he has been asked by myself multiple times to stop putting them in the laundry inside out and he hasn’t listened to me.

My husband (49M), who has been inconsistent with discipline, thinks I’m overreacting. He believes it’s my responsibility to keep the house in order since I’m at home. However, I feel that kids need to learn how to take care of themselves and contribute to household chores. 

Our 14 year old son is responsible for taking out the trash, cleaning his bathroom and bedroom and occasionally vacuuming the living room if I need help as I have an autoimmune disease which can leave me unable to do much when I’m having a flare up. I don’t think it’s too much to ask that his laundry be right side out when he puts it in the laundry basket. 

Additionally, I contribute over 75% of our household income from an investment I made when I was young which has allowed my husband to work part time when he needs a break as he does have a physically demanding job. Despite this, my husband doesn’t consistently back me up on discipline or enforcing rules. He thinks I should be grateful I’m able to be at home and able to take care of the family’s needs and shouldn’t complain about anything since I don’t have to work anymore.

Now, his mother (53) has never ever approved of me, even blaming him for everything that went off in our relationship. Funny enough, must of it was because of her rudeness to me, and calling me a retard, and unstable, just because I was diagnosed with mild autism.

My fiancé has somewhat a strained relationship with his mother, as she’s always been quite controlling, and likes to gaslight him alot. And he completely cut off his sister (27) for always trying to cause drama in our relationship. Even the relationship with his brother (22), who usually stood by him has been tainted.

The last shenanigan they pulled was on his birthday. His mother, sister and brother, tried to bribe him, and gaslight him into spending his most recent birthday with them, instead of the birthday I had planned and prepared for, even paid for.

Now, his mother (53) has never ever approved of me, even blaming him for everything that went off in our relationship. Funny enough, must of it was because of her rudeness to me, and calling me a retard, and unstable, just because I was diagnosed with mild autism.

My fiancé has somewhat a strained relationship with his mother, as she’s always been quite controlling, and likes to gaslight him alot. And he completely cut off his sister (27) for always trying to cause drama in our relationship. Even the relationship with his brother (22), who usually stood by him has been tainted.

The last shenanigan they pulled was on his birthday. His mother, sister and brother, tried to bribe him, and gaslight him into spending his most recent birthday with them, instead of the birthday I had planned and prepared for, even paid for.

121,1cxyqta,AITA for taking my mom’s joke seriously?,"My brother Leo (16) is a really quiet kid. He mostly keeps to himself and doesn’t even talk to the family much. While we know what he likes and what he doesn’t in the general sense, we don’t know much about his interests. 

We were eating dinner as a family a while ago when he suddenly asked if he could go to a concert. Our parents said sure and asked him for the details (who, where, when, price, etc). He was extremely hesitant and clearly didn’t want to tell but our parents were insistent and he told us it was some boyband. Everyone was a little taken aback and dad was like “a boyband? are you going with a girl?” but Leo said it was just him. 

Well I was visiting yesterday and my brother was in a really shitty mood. I asked my other brother what was up and he said mom and dad had been teasing him a lot about the boyband thing and he didn’t end up buying a ticket and missed the concert (which was yesterday?) 

I felt really sad for him because he seemed to really like this group so I ordered him a shit load of merch. It was pretty pricey and it’ll take a while to get here because it’s from abroad but I don’t regret it one bit.

I told my mom about it because I was going to buy her something she asked for but decided to use that money for my brother instead. 

She sort of laughed and then told me I should just go ahead and cancel the orders because he might not be grateful and “he’s a guy, what’s he going to do with all that anyways.” She went onto say some homophobic things about her own son. She was also being racist towards the boyband and which is silly because dad is pretty much the same race as them (me and my brothers are literally mixed???). 

I was extremely angry and told her that she’s being very nasty. She tried to act oblivious but I told her that no one’s falling for it and that she’s disappointed me bad. She got all quiet and said she was just joking and I’m overreacting. I told her to take her jokes somewhere else and hung up on her.

122,1cxylix,WIBTA if I re-home my pet? ,"About two years ago, my partner (M25) and I (F27) adopted a cat. As I already have another cat, we thought it would be nice to adopt another. We felt like we were in a good place and my other cat could use another. Just to preface, from what I witnessed, there seems to be no problem between the cats themselves, just between us and the cat. 

This cat has been awful from day one, I thought he would grow out of it (like how the first one did) but I was wrong. He, of course, was very shy when we first got him and was shy for the first month, which is totally fine. However, he just doesn’t trust us. It’s been over a year now and he still runs from us or pees when he is scared (he has ruined countless items because of this). We definitely don’t have a connection with each other as well. I have tried taking him to the vet (which usually ruins the progress we make with him) and bought the plug ins. Nothing is medically wrong with him and the plug ins don’t work. Medicine doesn’t work because he won’t take it and if we try to force it in him, he pees. 

I know it’s dramatic but I feel like a prisoner in my house. Why keep him if he clearly doesn’t like us? After a year, I would think he would be used to us but he isn’t. I’m just worried for the future for when we have kids. He doesn’t like when we are too loud (he pees or runs away) what is he going to do with a kid? Or when I’m pregnant, he stresses me out enough already, I don’t want something bad to happen to a baby. 

I try to tell to fiancé but he just seems aloof to it.  Not sure if this is the right decision because I know people who own cats that are “horrible”. Meaning they don’t like people but the owners just “ignore them”. I just don’t think it’s a good quality life for either party but not sure if I’m over thinking.

I love helping people and everyday i try to make a difference. I cant spill all of the details but this is what is happening right now. One of our patients has been admitted with a psychosis. This is not the first time for him, but it is my first introduction to him. His psychosis is drug related. After a period of withdrawal, he has now been admitted to us to investigate the psychosis and support him. two weeks ago I found him in his room angry and sad at the same time. At first he refused to tell me what was wrong, and after half an hour of sitting on the floor in silence and just being present, he carefully started his story. He says that this happened every time during his admission. This patient has parents who support him financially.
He can purchase things from a ""shop"" in our hospital. Especially foods that are not included in the daily diet such as chips and chocolate. But also for cigarettes. According to him, this money is always stolen in our department and because he always closes his room and knows that only we can enter his room, he is sure that it is one of my colleagues. He has already raised this issue and has been told every time he is imagining it. After our conversation I started discussing this with the team and was immediately told: okay, here we go again. There was no room for my opinion and no will to find a solution. I see our patient sink deeper out of disappointment and I can imagine how lonely he must feel. After much thought I came up with a solution. I told him I had a solution to find out what happened to his money. without suspecting any of my colleagues. The solution was for me to hide the money without him knowing where it is. I took a picture of it so I had proof of it. I hid the money behind the nursing gloves. My patient left for the weekend so he has not been in his room without my supervision. I didn't go to his room when he wasn't there because it didn't feel good. So last monday the time had come..he came back from his weekend and I decided to take a look if the money was still there without his presence (he was in group therapy). To my surprise I saw that the money was gone. I went to the head psychiatrist who was grateful for the information. He said that he had the feeling that the patient was delusional and that he does not know that this is certainly not the case, but that this is very good tangible information. I am impartial. I have not told the patient anything about the money, the psychiatrist does this after he finds a safe way to do this. there is a lot of distrust that needs to be repaired.

I asked him if he could suggest something different to his friends cause I really would like to go once in a while, and I have no friends here (I’m really introverted and I’m having hard times finding new friends), so he’s the only one I could go out with. I have social anxiety and I couldn’t enjoy the meal if I went alone.

I’ll admit, I was being petty, but I was fed up, so I delivered some, paying the double for less food. When the food arrived he asked if he could have some cause seeing it made him hungry.

127,1cxx7k5,WIBTA if I told my friend about her husbands recreational drug use! ,"I (f) am close friends with Jane. She is married to Sid, who is a close friend of my husband. 

My husband mentioned fairly casually that Sid sometimes does a little white powder on a night out, which explains his 2 day ‘hangovers’ after a big night (which leads to lots of complaining by Jane to me). 

WIBTA if i told her or asked her if it could be drugs as it fees a bit weird that I may know why it’s such an issue! I would want to know if other way around and they also have kids. 

Husband obviously wants me to stay out of it as may impact his relationship. We don’t have any idea if they are open with each other about these matters, seems unlikely but who knows. 

My husband doesn’t think he has a out of control  problem as such or not enough of one for us to involve ourselves in.

128,1cxwv0d,AITA for refusing to change the name I chose for my daughter so my sister can one day use it if she has a daughter?,"I'm (23f) pregnant with my first child, a daughter. My boyfriend (23m) and I have decided to name her Wren. We didn't tell many people yet. My boyfriend told his parents and I told my parents and my siblings. After I told my sister (30f) she asked me if we could talk and she showed me a list she had of names her and her husband had chosen for future babies. Wren was the girl name they had chosen too. I had no idea. My sister never thought anyone in the family would go for a name like Wren. And when she heard we had chosen that she got a little sad.

You see, my sister and her husband have been TTC for 6/7 years and have been unsuccessful with the exception of one miscarriage 5 years ago. Right now they are undergoing some fertility treatments to try and have a child. It's been super hard on her and when my boyfriend and I learned we were expecting we agreed I should tell my sister first and give her time to process. She told me how much she appreciated it and she was sad for a little while after. As well as super jealous. But I understand because this is something she has wanted for so long and it was difficult for her to see me get pregnant so fast.

I love my sister and I always want to try and be understanding and not make her feel like shit because I'm having a baby and she's still trying to. But when she asked me to please choose another name so she could name a future daughter that, I didn't feel like I could agree to that. My daughter feels like Wren to both me and my boyfriend. We've already got some items with her name on them. We have grown very attached and bonded more with our Wren. 

I know to many it's not a big deal for people to share the same name in a family but our family doesn't really like doing that. Our names might have been used in previous generations of the family but we never liked the idea of two living members of the family sharing a name and we're all so close that it would get confusing. So I know to her it means Wren has to leave their list if I use it.

I told my sister I couldn't change my daughter's name after we had already committed so heavily and the name felt so right to us. She burst into tears but told me she understood. She hugged me and everything. Then my BIL got involved and he tore me a new one for not sacrificing a name so that my sister can hold onto the hope that she'll get to name their future daughter that one day. He said she has been such a good big sister to me and this would cost me nothing.

The town we’re staying in has a really chill, coastal vibe that we love. The chill vibe seems to permeate through everything, however, including dog handling and road safety.  We’ve encountered several incidents of people (usually boomers, sorry to generalise) just letting their dog wander out onto local roads. Each time the person has not seemed too fussed about getting them to come back, just slowly finishing whatever they are doing and gradually wandering over to corral them back so traffic can continue. Before today’s incident, this has happened like 3-4 times in the few days we’ve been here. A particularly egregious version of this happened today, which, combined with lack of sleep and caffeine, may have caused me to react more harshly than I should have.

We were on our way to grab breakfast, travelling along a local suburban road. About 50m ahead of us I could see a beagle sitting smack-bang in the middle of the road. His owner, an older gentleman, was rummaging through the back seat of his car which was parked on the side of the road. Both we, and a car coming from the opposite direction, had to stop. We probably could have tried to dart around the dog but I didn’t want to risk it in case it moved suddenly. The other car beeped their horn, at which point the guy half-arsedly started coaxing the dog over. The dog then came and sat in our lane, so I beeped again. The guy really didn’t seem to be trying at all. Eventually he started shuffling over and led the dog off the road. I gradually moved up until he was parallel with my car and I stopped and opened the passenger window.

I’m not usually a confrontational person but I had really had it by this point. I leant over and said something to the effect of: “Your dog is going to get f*cking flattened. Keep it off the road you silly old c*nt” and then drove off.

My wife seemed a bit shocked afterwards (she is a very gentle natured person). She agreed that he was an idiot but still thought I overreacted. I apologised to her, of course.

To be clear I wasn’t really angry about the inconvenience of being made to wait. We’re on holidays, I’m in no hurry. It’s more about his reckless lack of regard for his dog’s safety.

Yesterday, she asked me to bring her some lunch to her job, so I asked her if i’m going to swing by her job first and pick up her card to pay for the food. Thankfully, she said yes, and after that I asked kinda half-jokingly if she’d pay for my lunch too. The way she reacted seemed like she was offended by the question and she quickly said no and asked why I would ask her that. So I went on to explain that, considering that we’re not dating anymore, I had been spending a lot of money on her whenever we hang out such as paying for both our meals whenever we’re together or gas whenever I pick her up to take her places. 

She then asked if I expected her to pay me back for the money I’ve spent on her, to which I said no, I was just asking this one time to see what she’d say. She then explained how she’s not going to pay for my food because she’s saving her money and told me I should know that already because we talked about it before and then hung up the phone. 

A few minutes later she called back and said that me asking if I was going to pick her card up from her was rude because that meant I had assumed that she was going to make me pay for her food again(which I think is a valid assumption because I’ve been paying for her food a lot lately). Then she went on about how I actually haven’t spent a lot of money on her, and actually I have just been spending money on myself like clothes or video games and then hung up again. After that I decided I wasn’t going to get her any food even if it was on her dime. AITA? 

edit 1: added paragraph breaks

edit 2: I always hate having money related conversations with her because it seems it always leads to an argument over who’s spent more on who, in which I always say the same thing that I would always pay for food even at expensive restaurants so her paying for me once wouldn’t hurt, and she always says that she used to offer to pay for herself but I would always say no. Then I would say that was early in our relationship when I was trying to impress her, and besides we’ve broken up but I still continue to pay for her whenever we’re out together.

Yesterday, she asked me to bring her some lunch to her job, so I asked her if i’m going to swing by her job first and pick up her card to pay for the food. Thankfully, she said yes, and after that I asked kinda half-jokingly if she’d pay for my lunch too. The way she reacted seemed like she was offended by the question and she quickly said no and asked why I would ask her that. So I went on to explain that, considering that we’re not dating anymore, I had been spending a lot of money on her whenever we hang out such as paying for both our meals whenever we’re together or gas whenever I pick her up to take her places. 

She then asked if I expected her to pay me back for the money I’ve spent on her, to which I said no, I was just asking this one time to see what she’d say. She then explained how she’s not going to pay for my food because she’s saving her money and told me I should know that already because we talked about it before and then hung up the phone. 

A few minutes later she called back and said that me asking if I was going to pick her card up from her was rude because that meant I had assumed that she was going to make me pay for her food again(which I think is a valid assumption because I’ve been paying for her food a lot lately). Then she went on about how I actually haven’t spent a lot of money on her, and actually I have just been spending money on myself like clothes or video games and then hung up again. After that I decided I wasn’t going to get her any food even if it was on her dime. AITA? 

edit 1: added paragraph breaks

edit 2: I always hate having money related conversations with her because it seems it always leads to an argument over who’s spent more on who, in which I always say the same thing that I would always pay for food even at expensive restaurants so her paying for me once wouldn’t hurt, and she always says that she used to offer to pay for herself but I would always say no. Then I would say that was early in our relationship when I was trying to impress her, and besides we’ve broken up but I still continue to pay for her whenever we’re out together. Then she would say that my birthday and Christmas gifts were extremely expensive and she would always break the bank for me(once again that was when we were together),which I know isn’t true but I always leave the argument there because I would hate to start bringing up actual numbers and compare them because I feel like that could cause a huge argument between us which I don’t want.",0.0,0.20327240228652954,0,1
135,1cxutys,AITA for not helping out with my bsf birthday?!?,"me 19F, My best friend (18F) is having her birthday party tomorrow. We’ve been friends since we were kids, but our lives are quite different and I’ve never gotten around to telling her this stuff because of our upbringing and how she probably wouldn’t understand coupled with the fact we only got close recently in the past 2 years. I grew up in a really poor environment with divorced parents, while she had a happy and healthy family with good financial support. I’ve always had to work part-time jobs and understand the value of every cent, while she was fortunate enough to receive money from her parents whenever she needed it.

Here’s the story: she texted me today about the transportation plans for her birthday. She said her car can fit seven guests, and mine could fit all five remaining guests. The way she told me was more of a directive than a request, which felt odd. But since she’s my best friend and it’s her special day, I agreed.

Later, I found out I’m also expected to drive everyone home after the party. This was surprising because they all live far away, and it seemed like I was just expected to do it without any prior discussion. What’s so weird is her older sister can drive and could use their family car to drive the remaining 5 people but for some reason I was assigned to do that…I was excited to attend her birthday party as a guest and enjoy the celebration, but now I feel like I have to take on responsibilities and worry about completing tasks for her, or she’ll be upset. Gas is expensive, and she told me to make sure my tank is full, as if gas is cheap and my parents would pay for it. On top of this I had a spot in the car of 7 but my spot was taken by this girl they met recently and don’t even know that well…. they weren’t even sure about inviting her.

136,1cxujrz,WIBTA for missing my sister's graduation?,"My sister is graduating from high school in a few days which is an amazing accomplishment. There are a few factors that are contributing to me being reluctant to attend, but overall, I could make it if I really tried.

1.) The main reason is I'm currently trying to go no contact with my mom. Years of abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, and extreme mental health issues have caused me to finally reach my breaking point. I also don't want my child exposed to her behavior to the point where it becomes normalized as it did with me. My grandmother is attending with my mom and I know for a fact when we get there, my mom will pretend we never had an argument or conversation about going no contact and she'll try to hug my daughter. And I won't have the guts to tell her no in front of my grandma. I have to see my mom in order to get the tickets, plus my grandma will be confused and hurt if I don't greet them.  I'm terrified of things going back to normal and recognize that I'm in a weak spot right now.  If I see her this soon with so little time to process and set boundaries, I will likely give in and get sucked back into the cycle of abuse. 

2. My husband works until 4:30 and graduation is at 6:00. He's a teacher and because it's his last day of school, he can't request the day off. Also, the last day of school usually runs later because teachers have end of year meetings and have to pack up their classrooms. In order for this to work, I'd have to drop him off at work in the morning which is over an hour away, come back home, pick him up (hopefully not too late), and drive to the graduation venue which is about another 45 minutes to an hour away in traffic. (We only have one car). We'd be cutting it real close. Which leads into my last point.

3. I'm eight months pregnant with epilepsy and pregnancy can lower the threshold making it easier to have a seizure.  Although I technically can drive, I don't unless I absolutely have to.  Though the risk is low, it still makes me incredibly anxious and paranoid. I know my husband can drive most of the way, but I'll still be driving for at least 2 hours that day. 

I love my sister and want to attend. She deserves love and support from her older sister especially with this amazing milestone. I promised to make it up to her, but I know it won't be the same. So, would I be the asshole?

137,1cxudcx,AITA for letting my dog poop in a neighbors yard even though I cleaned it up,"We recently moved from a neighborhood that had sidewalks and a grassy area between the sidewalks and the street. When taking our dog for a walk we always ensured our dog went to the bathroom in this area and the neighborhood even had dog waste stations with baggies and garbage cans to assist with the cleanup. We have always been very conscious of making sure we pick up any poop immediately and place it in a garbage can. 

We recently moved to a more rural neighborhood without sidewalks. We always stay on the pavement but allow our dog to get to the first few feet of grass along the street if he needs to use the bathroom. We make sure to have baggies with us and immediately clean up any poop and bring it home to place in the garbage if he needs to go. 

I was out walking the dog yesterday and he must’ve had an upset stomach because he had two loose stools during the walk. I cleaned up both to the best of my ability and had two baggies with me while heading back home. 

A neighbor from a block before drove down to me, now a block over, to tell me he has seen me allowing my dog to go in the grass along the road and he’d like me to stop doing that. I showed him the two baggies and asked what I was supposed to do and he flippantly responded asking if I had a backyard. I said yes, but if I’m out for a walk what am I supposed to do if my dog needs to use the bathroom. He said he makes sure his dog uses a common area in the neighborhood. My question then was if he actually stops his dog from going to the bathroom by pulling them out of position if they start to go. He didn’t like that. I told him I wouldn’t let my dog go in the yards moving forward and headed home.

138,1cxuc5u,AITA for telling my boyfriend his ADHD is not an excuse?,"AITA for not allowing my boyfriend to forget chores?

I live with my boyfriend of two years. we do have pets that he is willing to feed most days as he understands the urgency of that chore. 

I work three jobs currently and clock in over 60 hours a week between work and full time study. He has a part time job and has multiple days off a week, but usually makes plans to hang out with friends on those days. He does not make enough for us to split bills or groceries etc equally, and the job is new so previously I have been paying for everything solo. I would say it was 90/10 until recently, and now it’s more like 70/30. 

Usually when I am working, I take time to leave him a list of a few things to do while I’m away. Nothing ridiculous, usually a load of washing and packing dry clothes away, defrosting meat so i can make dinner for us after work, walking our dog etc. 

He has ADHD and repeatedly forgets to do things or says he will do them the next day which leads to me doing them myself. I have explained that if I put something on his daily list, it’s usually something I have already been meaning to do and have pushed back so it’s relatively urgent, or it’s a daily task like washing that needs to happen every day. He will say something like ‘You don’t have to cook dinner every night, if i was living by myself i would just eat cereal and be fine’ or something about vacuuming etc not being urgent. I have recently been keeping track , I would say on average, if I give him for 15 minute tasks to complete on his day off, he routinely forgets at least one if not two of those tasks, often with the excuse that he was hanging out with friends and didn’t get time.

it all came to a head today. I got home from work, I took an afternoon off to visit my sister who has just had a baby, and he was working this evening, starting at 5 and finishing around 8. When i got home there was a massive pile of clothes on our bed that he had been putting off packing away for at least three or four days and just adding dry washing to. also, he left our bedroom door open and our dog had destroyed a new pair of shoes i got two days ago. he also hadn’t taken meat out of the freezer, so we had nothing for dinner, and the sink was full of dishes. apparently he had friends over this morning. i called him and left a voicemail saying he is a selfish prick and he needs to start pulling his weight or i am leaving. i told him to get the bus home and not drive ‘my car’ anymore since he hasn’t paid a single dollar for it since he crashed his old one and we loaned a new one. he called back apologising and begging me to forgive him but also said it wasn’t his fault that he made plans today and said he would do the chores tomorrow. i’m staying with my parents tonight.

My dad was varsity in football, basketball, and baseball. My grandpa coached college sports, and genuinely sports are what he values most in life. My aunt, uncle, their daughter who is my cousin “Abby”(20F), and now my younger brother (12M) have all been varsity.

I was put in basketball from a young age, and everyone expected me to enjoy it and be good at it for some reason. I played 2nd-8th grade, and was never particularly good. I dreaded practice, and my parents would constantly hassle me that I needed to practice every morning or I would never be a basketball star. I hated one of my coaches, and I think I actually developed some form of temporary OCD from it that year. 

I wasn’t good enough to make varsity in basketball or volleyball, which I was put in later. I was much better at academics. I actually liked other sports that I could’ve been good at (tennis, track), but my parents never put me in those. I watched everyone praise my cousin Abby, a varsity basketball and volleyball player who was never good at school, while no one ever praised me on academics. I always felt inferior and like I didn’t belong in my own family. I felt my grandparents loved my cousin but not me, because I couldn’t make varsity. They would make fun of me for being into academics and not sports. I always wondered what was wrong with me, and felt like less of a person.

I quit basketball in high school, and later volleyball, and I got into an Ivy League school for academics. I told my mom that I finally feel appreciated by my family, but growing up I felt inferior and unloved, because I was forced to play sports I wasn’t good at and didn’t like for years.

I always felt inferior and like I didn’t belong in my own family. I felt my grandparents loved my cousin but not me, because I couldn’t make varsity. They would make fun of me for being into academics and not sports. I always wondered what was wrong with me, and felt like less of a person.

I quit basketball in high school, and later volleyball, and I got into an Ivy League school for academics. I told my mom that I finally feel appreciated by my family, but growing up I felt inferior and unloved, because I was forced to play sports I wasn’t good at and didn’t like for years. I spent my whole childhood wondering why I couldn’t be better at basketball. My mom is very upset about this and said: “We never told you that you had to do sports.” But that’s always how I felt, like I was worse than my cousin, and she said I’m making her out to be a bad mom. AITA?

Edit: I should mention that I think my sports experience negatively impacted my whole sense of self growing up, and I fear for my brother (12M). He’s being pushed much harder than I was, and people are already talking about how he has to play in college. He’s expressed burn out already from traveling for sports so much. My grandpa also pulled him out of class to go try on basketball shoes, too. Him not wanting to watch a sports game is taken as a personal insult to my grandpa.",0.0,0.0702589675784111,0,1

The coffee shop is relatively small, with under 10 tables available. I sat at the most comfortable looking chair in the shop, one of four chairs at the biggest table. I was a little into my drink and cake when a group of 4 middle-aged people asked me if I could move so they could sit together there.

All 4 were on the larger size and I could understand how they would be uncomfortable on other seats in the shop. The one I was sitting in had high back, arm rests and was plush with soft leather. I, however, would also like to sit comfortably. I told them they were free to take the other three chairs and pull an extra one to the table.

They told me they had something to discuss among themselves and would appreciate if I move. Again, I told them I like the chair and I was there first so I would not move.

They grumbled about selfish youngsters, gave me the stink eye, and asked the shop to make their orders to go.

The teacher(teacher Aldrin, not his real name) since last month keeps telling us we have a voucher. Right now, I heard to my classmate, who also have a teacher in the school that teacher Aldrin would not be doing any vouchers to us.
So when I came back home, I told my mom how angry I was at my teacher because of how he was lying and how there's only less than a week to apply for a voucher. Then my mom got mad at me on how I don't focus on school ""enough"" and how I don't ask to the teachers, how I should know since before because I'm on school everyday, she was shouting at me. I tried giving answers to her but she just don't listen so I just ignored her and only said that the teachers doesn't tell us anything.

Just a background, they don't listen to me explain when we ""fight"", even if they're in the wrong. I have to raise my voice to them and they'll call me disrespectful and be grateful to all the things they've ""done"" to me. I don't do much chores it's because my mom doesn't want me to do anything and her condition is to do well on studies. I'm a top student who is graduating and have all the best subjects in class. Another info is that my mom is like a dictator since when I was a child, (where she controls everything, even when I'm eating) except right now currently.
So, she went up in my room and then again, asked me if I was done in the voucher. Now, I told her no because I need my teacher Aldrin's help, with basic info such as lrn, etc. and I need my father's help with his salary, what's the tax return, etc. now, she became mad at me because why am I not asking teacher Aldrin yet, which I did then she told me to ask the other teachers (the teachers don't know anything sadly). After that, she berated me on how I don't ask teachers everyday, how I don't ask help to my father(which is not here), etc. I tried telling her my side of story but she doesn't listen, so this where I think I'm an AH. Basically, I raised my voice, hoping she could listen to my side, but no.

My girlfriend (F26) has had the same 'emotional support water bottle' for approximately 3 years. She takes it with her everywhere. And only drinks water out of that bottle.

I (M25) found out a month ago that doesn't wash it. Just refills it once it runs out.

So I washed it, and holy shit. There was mould growing inside. I tried my best to clean it, but I couldn't get it all out no matter how much I tried. I told her about the mould and that I think she needs to get a replacement water bottle. She said no. That it was her decision. I kept bringing it up and she kept saying no.

So I went out and bought four different waters. One identical one and three that are really similar. Gave them to her and tried to explain that drinking out of a mouldy water bottle is going to affect her health. She relented and started taking the identical one to work. But she said she wanted to keep the original, just to have.

I backed off.

I chucked it right then and there. I threw it in the bin and told her what I did. I said she can't keep drinking out of that and putting her health at risk.

152,1cxt0ae,AITA for washing my hands of my wife's DIY disaster ,"We both do laundry but my wife wanted the laundry done upstairs because she dreads going down to our little basement dungeon whereas i dont give a shit.  She gets the idea that the back porch of the house can be turned into a laundry/mud room. We talked about it and while I'm pretty handy around the house, I'm not basically build an addition handy. A project like that done by professionals would be quite expensive and while we do pretty good as a family it would've been something we couldn't afford. Not to be deterred, she enlisted the help of a family member who knows a handy man who works ""cheap"". 

I'm kinda against it but my wife is like a dog with a bone when she wants something and it happened. The guy did the plumbing work, electrical, drywall and new siding on the house. I'll admit it looked ok but the problems starting basically from day one. First there was a leak in the cold water line and guess who had to call the guy to get him to come and fix it. I should add here the only advice I gave my wife is to make sure the guy knows to insulate the piping so it doesn't freeze and break in the cold winter months. She told me he was on it. She had him install insulation and heat tape. Guess what happened that winter. Frozen pipes. So you know who was thawing pipes with a hair dryer. Ol hubby. 

So over the few winters we'd have, we'd have days in the single digits and guess who's up night running water so the pipes don't freeze? Mr. HUSBAND, that's who. Where's Mrs Wife while all this is happening you might ask? She's sound asleep because she doesn't have to think about it.  Who's tracking the weather from November to April because they need to be ready? Me thats who. And when I finally had had enough and copped an attitude because it had gotten old. I told her it sucks that I have to carry the mental load of a project that was her idea. When something happens I have to make the phone calls, I have to wait around for the plumber etc. 

This past year though is the final straw for me. The access to the plumbing is a tiny little hole to a literal crawl space. We had another freezing Incident and being over it, I made my way through the hole only to discover the reason why it kept freezing. My guy put the heat tape on the outside of the insulation. I lost it. I told her it was bullshit that I have to keep dealing with this, while she doesn't give it another thought and she said I'm blaming her making it her fault to rub her nose in it. I'm tired of it. It's all on her now. 


TLDR:

Wife wanted laundry upstairs, got a handy man though a family members. He did shoddy work and whenever there's problem, husband has to take care of it.

153,1cxsulg,AITA for telling my dad he is useless to the family?,"I (17M) am a high school junior taking an online college class through a dual enrollment program. Last week, I had a huge presentation due for my college class, but I hadn’t started it because my high school workload was overwhelming. Plus, I just got accepted to a summer job that I’m really excited about and I hadn't told my dad about it yet.

Feeling the pressure, I asked my dad (42M) if I could miss a day of school to focus solely on my presentation. He shot me down immediately, saying that attendance is crucial and I couldn’t just skip school. I tried to explain that this college class is really important and that I have A's in all my high school classes, but he wouldn't listen.

Instead, he started ranting about how my life is so easy and how all I do is play video games. He said a responsible adult would manage their schedule without needing a day off and accused me of bringing shame to the family with my laziness. He also pointed out that I don’t have a job or a driver’s license.

Halfway through his tirade, I finally snapped. I yelled back, saying that he spends his days playing video games alone while the rest of the family is at school or work, doesn’t have a job or any household responsibilities, and takes money from my mom to buy cigarettes.

He got furious and stormed out of the house. Later, my mom told me that I had really hurt his feelings and that I should apologize. I refused, saying I wouldn’t apologize. 

My dad began ""favoring"" my siblings more, like buying my brother new toys and spending more time with my sister. While I am left alone. 

I haven’t spoken to my dad for the past week, but my dad proceeds to make passive aggressive comments whenever I'm around doing anything.

To give some context,
A woman who my mom and grandmother knew passed away. My mom was given permission to practically take whatever fancied her and she saw that as an opportunity to take EVERYTHING. My mom brought home whole furniture pieces, dishes, tools, little decor pieces etc. If you think of something a lady in her 80s would have in her house my mom most likely took it. When my mom mentioned what she was going to do I told her it was a bad idea. Why? Because she had the impression she was going to be able to make money off of these things. She thinks that because everything is “vintage” and “ antique” she’d be able to make a significant profit, which I told her that wouldn’t be the case. 

Anyways, she didn’t listen to me. She dedicated DAYS going to this woman’s house, rented a U-Haul to bring all the junk ( because that was how much crap she brought to the house she needed to rent a f****** U-Haul ) and left everything at our house. My mom said “ I promise everything will be gone in a month”. It’s been 4 months and nothing has happened. Yes, my mom has driven around town trying to sell the furniture and everything else but just like I predicted no one wanted it and if someone was interested it wouldn’t be for the price my mom was expecting. 

After months of having the junk clutter up the house I woke up one morning and decided to put stuff in our front lawn with a big sign that said “ FREE STUFF FREE FURNITURE”. People took almost all the stuff I put out. I prioritized the small stuff to bring out and left out the big furniture. 

Soo the minute my mom gets home she realizes that things are missing. She was HYSTERICAL. I honestly have never seen my mother react this way but she was upset like screaming and cursing I honestly thought she was going to pass out from how much she was yelling. I knew of course she would be mad but not THIS mad. 

Finally after a back and forth of yelling my mom decided to pack her things and stay at my grandmother’s house because she felt as I went behind her back and I didn’t consider how she would feel  and said “ I didn’t have any right to get rid of her stuff”. Personally I had a problem with her saying “ her “ stuff when it was never hers and I feel she only got upset because she thinks someone is going to make money off the stuff instead of her. I told her she needs to let it go and realize that she made a mistake by bringing all of the crap to the house and realize that what is valuable now is our time and we should find peace in the fact that now these things have a new purpose and it is time to let this lady rest in peace with out her belongings chilling in our house.

At my school, it isn't a big event; some people might give a small gift to their favorite teacher. I never used to give gifts because I never felt particularly close to any of my teachers.

This year, I decided to give a small gift to one of my teachers, even though I wasn't particularly close to her. I chose a gift card to her favorite place and wrote a handwritten letter. I knew she appreciated gifts because I'd seen her get excited over even small ones from other students. 

As a high schooler with limited funds, I wanted to keep it simple and avoid seeming over-the-top or weird. This teacher treated her students like her own children and was very close with many of them, but she never quite treated me the same way. Sometimes she was really nice and a good overall teacher, but I was never sure if she liked me or not.

In the letter, I expressed my appreciation for her and how she inspired me. I filled the whole card but made sure nothing I wrote was too much or creepy. I was excited to give her the gift because I enjoy giving presents, but I also felt anxious that she might not like it since we weren't close. When I handed it to her, she said, ""You shouldn't have,"" and I quickly said goodbye and left because I had somewhere to go.

This happened on a Friday, and I assumed she would either email a thank you or thank me in person after the weekend. I didn't expect anything in return; I just wanted to know she liked it and avoid any awkwardness. When I saw her in class, she didn't say anything about the gift. We went through the entire class without speaking, and she also stopped saying hi to me in the hallways. It's been over two weeks now, and we still haven't talked about the gift.

I know I shouldn't expect a thank you, but as a people pleaser, I needed closure to know she liked it. I was planning to ask her for a college recommendation because I don't think my other teachers like me. Should I not ask her?

I 33f broke my femur in a freak accident a week ago, I have animals at my home, but live 5 hours from my. Parents. Mom 65, dad 67. They came up to care for my animals and look in on me while I recovered from major surgery for the fracture. 

10 years ago my dad had a massive stroke and is confined to a wheelchair as he can't feel his left side. He does have some use, but no feeling. He hates traveling and just wants to sit in his recliner and watch TV. 

I now have a rod and six screws in my femur and cannot bear weight on that leg for at least six weeks. I was released from hospital yesterday. They gave me the wrong wheelchair and I cannot move around my home without using a walker and hopping, which is dangerous as I am already accident prone. 

He keeps starting arguments with my mom who clearly wants to stay at least until I can  get the correct equipment and get a handle on taking care of myself and my home. He wanted to leave the day after I came home (aka today). 

We set Him up with YouTube TV so he could watch his shows, but he still wants to go home tomorrow and is even trying to leave me his wheelchair, which does fit through the doorways of my home in a ploy to leave tomorrow.

My colleague and friend 29/M (Let's call him Jack)  took this as an opportunity to try and date me. He wanted a serious relationship. I told him I wasn't over my ex and I didn't want him to be a rebound so I'll need time to get over my ex.

A month later he got annoyed that we weren't official, I guess because he was telling all the people at work that we were official, and he gave me an ultimatum that either we be in a relationship or not friends anymore at all.

I said I can't make that choice so he said fine and made the choice for me and started blatantly ignoring me.

A month after that I fixed things with my ex and we got back together and now Jack is going around telling people I played him and used him. Which was not true, I had full intentions of being in a relationship with him once I knew I could give 100% if myself into it.

And I didn't use him because I never let him buy me anything when we hung out.

Now Jack was tying to get a promotion and join my team at work and the manager let me know that I take priority, and if I'm not comfortable with him joining our team then he won't. I told the manager it is fine as long as he stops acting like a child, and that he is a hard worker.

Only to find out he is talking bad about me behind my back so I let him know the situation and how I actually told the manager that he should be allowed to join the team. And how if I'm not comfortable with him joining then he won't. I told him I vouched for him but I won't stay comfortable if he keeps bad mouthing me to people.

All of our ""mutual friends"" have been on his side from the start. I no longer consider them friends. 

I do not feel guilty at all because the way I see it he made his decision and now he must live with it.

One of our mutuals who is the only person not taking sides told me Jack tried a manipulation tactic on me which didn't work and now he is playing the victim to gain sympathy.

I(21F) live in a house with two other women both my age. We all have our own bedrooms and bathrooms however my bathroom is not connected to my room like how theres is(it is across the hall from my room).  Important context that my bathroom is pretty small with the toilet, vanity, and shower less than an arms length away from one another, in my home country the toilet is usually separate from the shower and vanity. 

The problem is they are using my bathroom without my permission. It wouldn’t be a bit deal to me if it wasn’t for two fact. 1. They leave the toilet seat up after use.  To each your own on that but it is really unsanitary and when my bathroom is so small and I have my towels and toothbrush in such a small vicinity it makes me feel unclean and icky. 2. They use my toilet paper. Know I know that doesn’t seem like a big deal and sounds petty but the two of them both have parents that send them weekly allowance where I work 5-6 days a week to support myself and all my expenses. 

I have had a few conversation about it with them before and they stopped using my bathroom for quite a while but I have noticed they have started again when I come home from work and my toilet seat is up. I feel now disrespected since they willingly go against my wishes and also feel a slight invasion of privacy since it is my personal bathroom. You do not seem me going into there bathrooms and using it when they are not around so I feel the same should be respected of me even though my bathroom is more public. 

I can to terms that I don’t want to have another conversation with them as I now feel it is a waste of time and have decided the only two things to try to fix this situation would be to put a lock on my bathroom or to remove the toilet paper from it.  Removing the toilet paper is what I am currently think about since it would be a lot easier to do and less aggressive of a measure.

I'll tell you when you get back"". This already kind of dampened my mood as I had a long day and getting some light exercise in some clear weather sounded quite nice. Not to mention I've made said plans with a couple people which now I may have to cancel. Not the biggest deal right?
