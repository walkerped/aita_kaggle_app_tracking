0,1cyvmb2,AITA for reporting my neighbor?,"AITA? I (30F) live in my first apartment alone in a complex. It’s a smaller complex only about 35 units in the whole building. The walls in this building are incredibly thin which isn’t surprising. 

The neighbor I share a wall with is incredibly loud and noisy. I’ll be going to bed around 10:30-11 and I will hear him loudly shouting at his tv or computer. He’s very obviously gaming with the boys. I believe he’s around my age by the sound of his voice. I can hear everything he does from when he’s moving dishes around to feeding his dogs. I leave him be. 

This specific neighbor and I had an issue about 10 months ago because he was lighting up the green leaves in his apartment. The smell makes me super sick and it would waft and linger in my bedroom because of the shared wall. I’m not a very confrontational person so I ignored it for quite a while until I couldn’t stand it anymore. I left a polite note on his door asking if he could take it outside as the smell makes me sick and politely reminded him it’s against our lease terms to even light up within 20 feet of the building. His response to the note was an “F*** you, Karen” and so I reported this to property management as my initial approach clearly meant nothing. Finally the smell and smoke went away. 

Yesterday, I received a note on a my door that read “sex too loud, pls play music !! ):” This is not coming from my apartment and I assumed the note came from my neighbor given the previous interaction. I responded to the note “that’s not me. But I hear you all the time playing video games & I leave you alone” and left the note on his doormat as it was left on mine. 

Last night at 10:30pm I got up from bed to get a glass of water and all my lights are off. And there is a sudden and incessant banging on my door. 3 loud bangs then a pause; then repeat, pause. Repeat, pause. At this point I’m terrified. I live in a more dangerous city. There have been issue with our mailroom being ransacked. Once at 3 am someone cop-knocked on my door. There’s always police sirens going right outside my window. This was just an uncomfortable experience. I’m home, alone, in the dark with someone banging on my door. And mind you, there is no peephole on my door and I’m not permitted to have a security camera outside my door as it directly faces another apt door 

After the third attempt. It got quiet and I neighbor’s door slam shut. I wait a few minutes and open the door to the original note aggressively taped to my door with it saying “hey Karen - you suck! This isn’t me…. But thanks!!! If you want to talk like an actual human lmk… otherwise F*** OFF”

Honestly I’m super upset and I end up reaching out to property management again and notifying them of how this situation has escalated. My last rent is due on July 1st and I’m supposed to be out by 8/31 but now I just feel uncomfortable and wish I could leave sooner.

2,1cyihfw,AITA for telling my mom to adopt a kid to replace me if she likes that kid so much,"AITA for telling my mom to adopt a kid to replace me if she likes that kid so much

I haven’t been living with my family in so many years. This year I’ve decided to visit and stay with them for the summer. I’ve gained a lot of weight. Even when I was a size S, she has always called me fat. With that, I have always thought of myself as fat even when back then I was definitely not. 

Every morning when I’m getting ready, she stares at me and tells me ‘you should start losing weight’. I usually just ignore this. Recently, she seems to have met up with her friend and her friend’s daughter (Ginny) My mom tells me Ginny used to be really ‘fat’ as a child but  ‘she’s so pretty now that she’s thin’. Every morning, she goes ‘you’d look good with makeup if you weighed less’, ‘Ginny has become so small but you’re so big’. 

Again, I would usually just ignore it but today it slipped out of my mouth and said ‘you should adopt Ginny as your child instead of me since you like her so much’. She got mad at me for being ungrateful and rude.

I know that she’s projecting her insecurities on to me. After getting pregnant, she has been unhappy with her body ever since I could remember. She would always say she was so thin before she got pregnant. 2 years ago, she started losing weight significantly. I think she’s been having bad eating habits, but for her, she thinks she’s being healthy. She seems happy about it and so I’m happy for her since I know she’s been struggling with her body image for decades. I remind her sometimes to make sure she’s getting enough nutrients and eating well for energy. We have an okay relationship, mostly due to the fact that we haven’t been living under the same roof for a long time. I struggled living with her when I was much younger. She would say a lot of hurtful things (aside from weight-talk) like ‘I wish I got rid of you as a child’, or ‘I’ll send you off to another country and I’ll forgot I ever had you etc. My brother would remind her of these and she would get angry saying were lying and she doesn’t remember any of it. Since moving out, I haven’t been a target aside from the occasional ‘you’ve become so fat’. I thought it would be better now since we have a decent relationship online. 

I went to surprise her at her work when I came back. She was happy in front of her coworkers but afterwards she told me to not do that again because she didn’t want her coworkers to see how ‘fat’ I became. If we go out, she tells me to meet her somewhere far away from her workplace where I won’t run into her coworkers on their way home. I want to keep a good relationship with my mom since I haven’t been home in so long so I haven’t really been saying anything.
What she thought was me being rude, was honestly pretty mellow. I wish I could say ‘if I become a mother one day, my only wish is for them to not have a mother like mine’. But I didn’t and won’t because regardless I still care for and love her a lot. I still want validation from her regardless of what she says.

3,1cyihdb,AITA. My SO won't answer her phone,"Hey everyone, my SO and I have been arguing about this for a while and I want to know if I'm being unreasonable.
For context, she's my girlfriend of over 4 years, we live together, and she's basically my wife even though it's not official yet. Our lives and futures are fully intertwined.
Now, she has some social anxiety. When she's in public, if her phone goes off it embarrasses her since it draws unnecessary attention. To combat this, she likes to keep her phone on silent. However, she's also a frequent day napper, so there have been quite a few occasions where I've needed to get in touch with her and haven't been able to since she's asleep and her phone is on silent. There have been a few times that I've had to return home just to wake her up so I could speak to her about something that needed immediate attention. As you can imagine, this can get really frustrating.

We've had repeated arguments/fights about it. Her counterargument is that getting upset over an SO falling asleep or having their phone on silent is unreasonable. I say that I don't have a problem with either of those things, I want her to be available in case, god forbid, some emergency happens.
She also says that I don't hold anyone else to the same expectations. But I say that yeah, of course I don't. She is my SO - we have a responsibility to be available for eachother at all times. I will never miss her call because I know I need to be there for her when she needs me. I fully expect the same in return.

It also doesn't help that it happened today when I've been suffering from a kidney stone for 3 weeks. So it is a time where I could need her because I'm in excruciating pain.

She has made strides to fix this, but occasionally she'll forget to switch her phone off of silent and it'll happen. I'd like her to change my contact in her phone to the setting where the phone always rings if I call. As SO's , I think it's perfectly reasonable to be able to have reliable contact whenever we need. But she's not too keen on the idea. I suspect it's out of fear that I'll call her when she's in a quiet public setting and embarrass her 🤷‍♂️. Although, I'd only ever call for emergencies.

6,1cyhtjk,WIBTA for taking my sisters car?,"I (32M) have raised my siblings (20M) and (19F) for 6 years due to parental drug use. I have put my career and life goals on stasis to provide them a comfortable lifestyle until they are financially independent.

 I've had a harder time with my sister through her teenage years. It was a daily fight to get homework and assignments turned in. Our tensions were further escalated her junior year in HS due to household stress as I went through a bitter divorce. Her senior year in HS she matured a lot and was self sufficient so the conflict between us died down and I was able to transition to a more relaxed brotherly role. My brother began college several hours away and is home sporadically except for summer break. Her and I get along well but too much time together causes friction.

She vents to me often and ask for advice but her primary emotional/social support is in the form of friends. In order to keep her in the same HS and friend circle while  managing post divorce debt I began working tremendous amounts of OT. After she graduated HS I began taking travel contracts for work which was great because she's always wanted to be more independent and I needed to pay off debt so I could work less.  I traveled intermittently while she watched our home, began a trade program and took care of my dog.

She recently signed an apartment lease with a friend and did not tell me. Instead, she initiated an argument , then said ""ok, I'm moving out"". Move in day is two months ahead and she hasn't paid the deposit yet. I found out about the pre-signed apartment from the friend who is unemployed. My sister works 20 hours a week but is poor with money management and is not ready to live alone w/o assistance while going to school full time. Her only expense is gas and personal entertainment and she rarely has more than a few dollars saved. Their plan to afford the apartment is ""we'll figure it out"" with excess student loans which cover about 15% of their needs.

Without her I can't travel for work and I'll take a 30-40% loss in income so I'll have very limited resources to help her or my brother.

7,1cyhnjy,AITA for not ‘participating’ in my brothers birthday?,"
Basically the plan was for my parents and brother to pick me up from work and then we’d go have dinner. I got in the car I could see my mom was upset. we got to the restaurant and I asked mom if she was upset and she said we would talk outside once seated. We sat and then mom and I went. she said that my brother said that he didn’t want to go to the restaurant. And kept going on about how it seemed like I manipulated her into thinking he wanted to go to the restaurant when he didn’t and I was confused because that isn’t what my brother and I spoke about. I tried telling my mom a month prior my brother said he wanted to go to the specific restaurant and how that wasn’t possible because of his work and he said ‘well maybe we can go for my birthday’ and last weekend I brought the idea up of us going on Saturday to celebrate his birthday and he said he was fine with it but we didn’t go on Saturday. So he said ‘maybe we can go Monday or Tuesday’ but we were both working. So we decided on today and we were both talking about it all week which is why I told my mom he wanted to go to the restaurant for his birthday. 

My mom was not understanding and told me it was my responsibility to make sure that he in fact wanted to go there and confirm with him. I said we were planning all week and if he didn’t want to go he should’ve said something sooner. She said that she felt manipulated and used. I was upset and told her feelings weren’t correct because that’s not what happened and she told me I wasn’t validating her feelings as she was invalidating mine. We went inside and I turned away from everyone and was not engaging because I was beyond upset.

Basically the plan was for my parents and brother to pick me up from work and then we’d go have dinner. I got in the car I could see my mom was upset. we got to the restaurant and I asked mom if she was upset and she said we would talk outside once seated. We sat and then mom and I went. she said that my brother said that he didn’t want to go to the restaurant. And kept going on about how it seemed like I manipulated her into thinking he wanted to go to the restaurant when he didn’t and I was confused because that isn’t what my brother and I spoke about. I tried telling my mom a month prior my brother said he wanted to go to the specific restaurant and how that wasn’t possible because of his work and he said ‘well maybe we can go for my birthday’ and last weekend I brought the idea up of us going on Saturday to celebrate his birthday and he said he was fine with it but we didn’t go on Saturday. So he said ‘maybe we can go Monday or Tuesday’ but we were both working. So we decided on today and we were both talking about it all week which is why I told my mom he wanted to go to the restaurant for his birthday. 

My mom was not understanding and told me it was my responsibility to make sure that he in fact wanted to go there and confirm with him. I said we were planning all week and if he didn’t want to go he should’ve said something sooner. She said that she felt manipulated and used. I was upset and told her feelings weren’t correct because that’s not what happened and she told me I wasn’t validating her feelings as she was invalidating mine. We went inside and I turned away from everyone and was not engaging because I was beyond upset.

8,1cyhlro,"AITA for telling my younger brother to “grow up”
","Am I (27F) the asshole for telling my younger brother that he needs to grow up, get a job, and move out? He is 23 years old and still living with my parents. I wouldn't have an issue with that if he was working, had a license, or ever left the house-- but he doesn't. In fact, he's becoming borderline agoraphobic because he spends every day playing video games in his bedroom. I'm really worried about his mental health if he continues this way.

My mom and dad were ""helicopter"" parents. My brother was born deaf with a rare form of hearing loss. He was premature and sick. My parents never psychologically got past controlling every aspect of his environment to protect him, and now he has low self-esteem and thinks he isn't capable of doing anything for himself. He also has trauma from being the only deaf person in school and feeling isolated. He's completely stuck; my encouragement and his monthly therapy sessions aren't cutting it. My parents now see the error of their ways, but it's too late for that. The damage is done. As compensation for their guilt, they buy him whatever he wants, pay for all his expenses, and don't charge him rent-- which just exacerbates his issues.

Today, my brother and my dad got into an argument because my brother said he wants to smoke weed in the house. For context, my dad does not use any substances because his father was an abusive addict. I believe that my dad has the right to feel safe and comfortable in his own home, despite his failing to instill independence in his son. My dad told my brother that “the day you smoke in my house is the day you pack your things and move out”. My brother texted me this evening to look for sympathy. I told him that if he didn't like Dad's rules, he could set up a plan for himself to move out and that I was willing to help him apply for housing assistance (not the first time I've offered). I told him that I'm sick of having this conversation and mediating between him and my parents. I also told him that if he wants independence, he needs to take some baby steps by researching some jobs he might be interested in and studying for his written driver's permit test. I told him that he needs to “stop acting like a child, or you’ll always be treated like one”. He comes back with ""I'm not asking you to be involved at f-ing all nor do I want you to be"". Then he started to tear up and left (I live a walkable distance from my parents).   

I’ve dedicated my career to working with young people with significant challenges and helping them succeed, but I can't seem to do this same for my own brother. I feel like a failure. Am I being an asshole to my brother? Should I have backed off? I recognize that he has trauma, but we can't all live in the past.

9,1cyh6dv,AITA for wanting to get a tattoo?,"Hi,

  
I'm an 18 year old active duty U.S. service member. Recently, I told my parents about my plans to get a sleeve tattoo done. My reasons for doing so have to do with the cultural and symbolic importance of the imagery I want depicted, and just the fact that I've wanted to get some ink my entire life. Plenty of people around me have tattoos, and I find it to be a very effective artistic and expressive medium for a person. After telling my parents about my plan, my mother was pretty neutral about it but my father seemed disappointed. Later on that evening, I called again as I usually do just to say good night, talk about the day, etc., and when my Mother asked my Father if he wanted to talk to me, he said he didn't want to. This was the first time that's ever happened. I've always had a very good relationship with my father, and he's always been encouraging of what I do, no matter what. It was a weird hearing him say that, and it kind of hurt. 

I understand why he feels the way he does. He doesn't like tattoos and has made that abundantly clear on many occasions, due to cultural reasons and the stigma associated with them. But I'm an adult, I have the means to do it comfortably and I'm not really jeopardizing my finances by doing it. I've thought on it for a very long time now, and I know I want to. But it's not worth being disowned to me. I'm not sure if he would, but he refuses to talk to me currently.

She has immense guilt about it and it hasnt been until recently that she feels a little more comfortable buying herself new underwear, bras, clothes, and makeup.

The other day I noticed a transaction come through on our shared credit card while my wife was at work. It was for Starbucks and over 7$. I texted her immediately to see if that was her, as I thought it may have been fraudulent activity since she so rarely goes to Starbucks or anywhere like that. There is a Starbucks in the same building at her work. She has worked at this place for over 2 years and has never bought anything from the Starbucks or cafeteria. She always packs lunch and brings her own coffee.

The next morning, I made fun of the price of the coffee. I said, sarcastically, ""hope that was a really good coffee for 7$!"" I saw her expression change, and tried to give her a side hug. She got really quiet and looked sad. She took our kids to school and then texted me from the gym afterwards explaining that she only went because her friends had invited her. She also pointed out that my cans of tobacco chew are more than 7$ and that I get several each week. She then did the math and figured that I spend over 700$ on chew a year. I apologized via text.

11,1cyh61k,AITA - for lying about my due date to my MIL,"My (29F) MIL lives in a different country along with their whole family. During our wedding last year she was extremely disrespectful towards me in ways I’m not even going to bother mentioning. 

In March I was in their country visiting with my husband- we found out I was pregnant there. I was 7 weeks when I found out, we told his mom dad and sisters right away. Only because we were there another week and it was better to tell them in person of course. 

My husband and I asked my in laws to keep this personal info to themselves until I’m 12 weeks at least. I told them not to tell a single other person, as I hadn’t even told my mom yet. They said okay. 

The next day all of my husbands cousins on his moms side started messaging me on Instagram.. “congratulations”. My jaw dropped and I almost dropped my phone. 

Im also high risk pregnancy- I have PCOS, a high BMI and many other factors. So I was extremely nervous that I wouldn’t even make it to 12 weeks. 

I told my husband he was very upset and called his mom and yelled at her. She didn’t even apologize at all 

Fast forward, I’m 18 weeks now. They asked me the due date when I went for my scan I told them I’m due in mid November.. though I’m due in Mid October. 

My MIL, FIL and sister in laws will be flying in in November thinking they will be here for the birth. But baby will be one month old by then. 

I did this because I know she won’t be giving me any privacy and will make everything about herself. I know she’ll absolutely help with nothing. She doesn’t do any house work at home.. she had a maid. Let alone help me. So her coming here will just make me more stressed during birth week.

I’m home with my family for summer break from college. I found out while with my bf and my brother.

I was on the phone with my parents that were at work. They told me the cost and asked me to pay it.

I said no way. It’s way too much money.

I asked if they could cover the cost but my parents said they unfortunately have a lot of bills and expenses and I have a good amount in savings.

I have around 5k from student loans, my parents, jobs, etc. But I pay rent and it feels like money goes by really fast. I asked again if they would pay it, but they said no.

So I didn’t ask him. But I asked my BF. I said it’s a lot of money, would you pay for it?

He said that I have the money on my own, I should just pay for it since I have savings.

My brother agreed. But I said you are my boyfriend. Don’t you want to help me? 

He said I never help with his car expenses, so I should probably just pay it. I said I could help going forward, but it would be really nice of him to cover it and it would show his faith in the relationship.

My brother snapped at me, “What are you doing to show your loyalty in this relationship?” I was taken aback and said we were having a conversation. He could mind his business.

I have no idea what upset him so bad. I was totally confused. I told him to chill the hell out. I wasn’t talking to him.

My bf said he has a lot of expenses, too, and stuff he has to pay and he can’t work much because he’s taking a lot of classes. He said I can help you out with some of it. 

I said it was fine, I didn’t want his money anyway. My brother said “good, be a grown adult.” God, I have no idea what his deal is. He was being so rude and he’s usually not that rude.

I did pay it myself. But I’m 20 and in college. Fuck me for wanting help? JFC. I just asked if he would help pay, it shouldn’t be a big deal.

Due to some issues in our past I have no desire to let him know I moved or let him around Tom but I feel guilty because this is my son’s father. I want my son to have a father but I fear that his biological one might not be the best. As of right now I think keeping him out of Tom’s life is the best, does that make me the A hole. 


Edit: BD is not on the birth certificate. I am the only parent legally. In order to get custody he would have to prove paternity. So right now he has no legal say in Tom’s life. He has made no effort to get a paternity test. ",0.0,1.0262438,1,0
15,1cygk7v,AITA partner is always grumpy/upset with me ,"We both work full time jobs and she is upset that she is doing all the cooking and cleaning. I work a physical labor job and she has a desk job. We both love our jobs but mine leaves me physically tired by the end of the day since I’m constantly doing physical labor and only sit down for a 30 min lunch. I also wake up 3 hours earlier and get home an hour later. Which leaves me with less time and less energy to do those extra necessary things that must be done. I’m sure the answer would be to split the work but then I feel like maintaining a 6 acre lawn (such as mowing and trimming should be split too) that’s a lot of work and I feel like it’s just overlooked. Dealing with someone who’s constantly grumpy is just emotionally draining after having a long day. Not sure how to go about improving this. Am I the asshole for not doing more on a daily basis for the house?

I told him that on June 28th, I would go to Disney World for the opening day of Tiana's Bayou Adventure. But the moment he heard that, he started going into a tangent about how the state of Florida was racist towards black people and Jewish people and that I would rather risk my life in a racist state for an amusement park ride instead of going to visit him. Mind you, I'm black, but I'm not Jewish, and I've been to Florida and lived there without any troubles or being treated in a racist way.

He mentioned my trip to Universal Studios Hollywood in 2023 for the opening day of Super Nintendo World and how I went there instead of visiting him in Seattle.

Mind you, I don't want to visit him because he's controlling and feels entitled to tell people (family and friends) how they should spend their money and how much food they should be allowed to eat on an outing. He will also complain about anything that isn't what he wants to do.

I went to his dad's funeral cause I was close to his mom, brother, and dad. and when he came for his job interview, I drove an hour from my town after work, no less to see him. I didn't plan to see him during that time because I was tired after working from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, but I did it out of the goodness of my heart.

I feel horrible because I love traveling to different places. I have been looking forward to visiting Disney World again because the last time I went was in 2019 with my family, and I had a horrible time with them because I didn't get to do what I wanted on the trip.

This weekend, we were all at my parents house and I was drawing with my niece. For context, she has a pretty mild cleft lip - enough to be noticeable, but not enough that it has had a significant impact on her life.

I feel really bad because she is obviously self conscious about it. I don't bring it up if she doesn't and I handle the topic with care - not that I think much about it anyway. She's my niece and I love her, end of story.

She asked me to draw her, but specified that she did not want me to include her cleft lip. I do not think it's my place to force her to be uncomfortable about something she struggles with, so after me asking ""are you sure? it's still a beautiful part of you' she insisted she didn't want me to draw it so I obliged. Also, for context, this was a quick cartoony pencil drawing of her, not a photorealotic drawing of what she would look like without.

When my sister came in the room and asked about the drawing she seemed annoyed and pulled me aside to ask why I would draw such a thing. I just said that niece asked me to not draw it and didn't feel it was my place to fight so that was that. 

My sister insist that I draw it in the future and was overall really upset that I didn't include it. I guess I don't have a condition anything like that so I dont know what it's like to be in her or my sisters shoes so I figured it was better to just skip it than fight her on it and potentially worsen the insecurity.

We get to the movie theater and it was practically empty so we take our time to buy popcorn. I buy it for myself but it’s huge so I ask her 3 times if she doesn’t want to share it with me.
She says that it’s too heavy since it’s the first thing she would eat the whole day and gets a grain mix pack. 
We get into the movie room, sit down and after 15 minutes of trailer she says she will get mozzarella sticks for herself. I said ok.

After she leaves there’s one more trailer and then the room gets dark and we receive the usual warning to turn off our phones so I put my phone inside my bag and on silence mode. A couple of minutes later the movie starts.
After 5 minutes I receive a notification on my Apple Watch. She’s asking for me to let her know when the movie starts. I tell her it had already.
She comes back minutes later angry and whispers at me that I was inconsiderate and should have told her immediately when it started.

She missed 2 scenes that I summarize in a sentence but I don’t feel bad because she left knowing eventually the movie would start and she took a risk.

So for context I love my grandchild but she has autism. Because of this she doesn’t like going out and so going to restaurants is very hard as she will throw tantrums and have very loud meltdowns. 
I’m turning 80 and this is a big moment for me and I really want to enjoy my birthday without having to cater to my granddaughters specific needs. The restaurant I want to go to doesn’t have her safe foods and she is 7 so I know she will want to eat.

The main reason I don’t want to invite my DIL (mother of my grandchild) is because recently she just keeps on telling me of all the family members who have died at my age and how she would be mortified and depressed if she ever lived up to my age. Last year we had a small family party for my birthday and she kept on saying how this will be my last birthday and how sad everyone would be next year because I most likely wouldn’t be there. I have asked my son to tell her to knock it off that it’s very rude and mean but she doesn’t stop.

I’m not stupid I’m sure I’m going to die in the next couple of years but I’m not gonna die right now. I just want a nice dinner at around six on the 1st of June with my son and my daughter. 

We can do like a lunch with my grandchild and DIL in the afternoon so that way I’m not excluding anyone.

My SIL is fine and told me that he’s not joining so that my DIL doesn’t feel excluded which I think is fair but my DIL is saying I’m being rude and entitled and that she’s only saying fact and that I’m a awful person for not wanting my granddaughter to be around. My son is on my side but this is getting too much.
