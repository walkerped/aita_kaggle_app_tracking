0,1cyvmb2,AITA for reporting my neighbor?,"AITA? I (30F) live in my first apartment alone in a complex. It’s a smaller complex only about 35 units in the whole building. The walls in this building are incredibly thin which isn’t surprising. 

The neighbor I share a wall with is incredibly loud and noisy. I’ll be going to bed around 10:30-11 and I will hear him loudly shouting at his tv or computer. He’s very obviously gaming with the boys. I believe he’s around my age by the sound of his voice. I can hear everything he does from when he’s moving dishes around to feeding his dogs. I leave him be. 

This specific neighbor and I had an issue about 10 months ago because he was lighting up the green leaves in his apartment. The smell makes me super sick and it would waft and linger in my bedroom because of the shared wall. I’m not a very confrontational person so I ignored it for quite a while until I couldn’t stand it anymore. I left a polite note on his door asking if he could take it outside as the smell makes me sick and politely reminded him it’s against our lease terms to even light up within 20 feet of the building. His response to the note was an “F*** you, Karen” and so I reported this to property management as my initial approach clearly meant nothing. Finally the smell and smoke went away. 

Yesterday, I received a note on a my door that read “sex too loud, pls play music !! ):” This is not coming from my apartment and I assumed the note came from my neighbor given the previous interaction. I responded to the note “that’s not me. But I hear you all the time playing video games & I leave you alone” and left the note on his doormat as it was left on mine. 

Last night at 10:30pm I got up from bed to get a glass of water and all my lights are off. And there is a sudden and incessant banging on my door. 3 loud bangs then a pause; then repeat, pause. Repeat, pause. At this point I’m terrified. I live in a more dangerous city. There have been issue with our mailroom being ransacked. Once at 3 am someone cop-knocked on my door. There’s always police sirens going right outside my window. This was just an uncomfortable experience. I’m home, alone, in the dark with someone banging on my door. And mind you, there is no peephole on my door and I’m not permitted to have a security camera outside my door as it directly faces another apt door 

After the third attempt. It got quiet and I neighbor’s door slam shut. I wait a few minutes and open the door to the original note aggressively taped to my door with it saying “hey Karen - you suck! This isn’t me…. But thanks!!! If you want to talk like an actual human lmk… otherwise F*** OFF”

Honestly I’m super upset and I end up reaching out to property management again and notifying them of how this situation has escalated. My last rent is due on July 1st and I’m supposed to be out by 8/31 but now I just feel uncomfortable and wish I could leave sooner.

2,1cyihfw,AITA for telling my mom to adopt a kid to replace me if she likes that kid so much,"AITA for telling my mom to adopt a kid to replace me if she likes that kid so much

I haven’t been living with my family in so many years. This year I’ve decided to visit and stay with them for the summer. I’ve gained a lot of weight. Even when I was a size S, she has always called me fat. With that, I have always thought of myself as fat even when back then I was definitely not. 

Every morning when I’m getting ready, she stares at me and tells me ‘you should start losing weight’. I usually just ignore this. Recently, she seems to have met up with her friend and her friend’s daughter (Ginny) My mom tells me Ginny used to be really ‘fat’ as a child but  ‘she’s so pretty now that she’s thin’. Every morning, she goes ‘you’d look good with makeup if you weighed less’, ‘Ginny has become so small but you’re so big’. 

Again, I would usually just ignore it but today it slipped out of my mouth and said ‘you should adopt Ginny as your child instead of me since you like her so much’. She got mad at me for being ungrateful and rude.

I know that she’s projecting her insecurities on to me. After getting pregnant, she has been unhappy with her body ever since I could remember. She would always say she was so thin before she got pregnant. 2 years ago, she started losing weight significantly. I think she’s been having bad eating habits, but for her, she thinks she’s being healthy. She seems happy about it and so I’m happy for her since I know she’s been struggling with her body image for decades. I remind her sometimes to make sure she’s getting enough nutrients and eating well for energy. We have an okay relationship, mostly due to the fact that we haven’t been living under the same roof for a long time. I struggled living with her when I was much younger. She would say a lot of hurtful things (aside from weight-talk) like ‘I wish I got rid of you as a child’, or ‘I’ll send you off to another country and I’ll forgot I ever had you etc. My brother would remind her of these and she would get angry saying were lying and she doesn’t remember any of it. Since moving out, I haven’t been a target aside from the occasional ‘you’ve become so fat’. I thought it would be better now since we have a decent relationship online. 

I went to surprise her at her work when I came back. She was happy in front of her coworkers but afterwards she told me to not do that again because she didn’t want her coworkers to see how ‘fat’ I became. If we go out, she tells me to meet her somewhere far away from her workplace where I won’t run into her coworkers on their way home. I want to keep a good relationship with my mom since I haven’t been home in so long so I haven’t really been saying anything.
What she thought was me being rude, was honestly pretty mellow. I wish I could say ‘if I become a mother one day, my only wish is for them to not have a mother like mine’. But I didn’t and won’t because regardless I still care for and love her a lot. I still want validation from her regardless of what she says.

3,1cyihdb,AITA. My SO won't answer her phone,"Hey everyone, my SO and I have been arguing about this for a while and I want to know if I'm being unreasonable.
For context, she's my girlfriend of over 4 years, we live together, and she's basically my wife even though it's not official yet. Our lives and futures are fully intertwined.
Now, she has some social anxiety. When she's in public, if her phone goes off it embarrasses her since it draws unnecessary attention. To combat this, she likes to keep her phone on silent. However, she's also a frequent day napper, so there have been quite a few occasions where I've needed to get in touch with her and haven't been able to since she's asleep and her phone is on silent. There have been a few times that I've had to return home just to wake her up so I could speak to her about something that needed immediate attention. As you can imagine, this can get really frustrating.

We've had repeated arguments/fights about it. Her counterargument is that getting upset over an SO falling asleep or having their phone on silent is unreasonable. I say that I don't have a problem with either of those things, I want her to be available in case, god forbid, some emergency happens.
She also says that I don't hold anyone else to the same expectations. But I say that yeah, of course I don't. She is my SO - we have a responsibility to be available for eachother at all times. I will never miss her call because I know I need to be there for her when she needs me. I fully expect the same in return.

It also doesn't help that it happened today when I've been suffering from a kidney stone for 3 weeks. So it is a time where I could need her because I'm in excruciating pain.

She has made strides to fix this, but occasionally she'll forget to switch her phone off of silent and it'll happen. I'd like her to change my contact in her phone to the setting where the phone always rings if I call. As SO's , I think it's perfectly reasonable to be able to have reliable contact whenever we need. But she's not too keen on the idea. I suspect it's out of fear that I'll call her when she's in a quiet public setting and embarrass her 🤷‍♂️. Although, I'd only ever call for emergencies.

6,1cyhtjk,WIBTA for taking my sisters car?,"I (32M) have raised my siblings (20M) and (19F) for 6 years due to parental drug use. I have put my career and life goals on stasis to provide them a comfortable lifestyle until they are financially independent.

 I've had a harder time with my sister through her teenage years. It was a daily fight to get homework and assignments turned in. Our tensions were further escalated her junior year in HS due to household stress as I went through a bitter divorce. Her senior year in HS she matured a lot and was self sufficient so the conflict between us died down and I was able to transition to a more relaxed brotherly role. My brother began college several hours away and is home sporadically except for summer break. Her and I get along well but too much time together causes friction.

She vents to me often and ask for advice but her primary emotional/social support is in the form of friends. In order to keep her in the same HS and friend circle while  managing post divorce debt I began working tremendous amounts of OT. After she graduated HS I began taking travel contracts for work which was great because she's always wanted to be more independent and I needed to pay off debt so I could work less.  I traveled intermittently while she watched our home, began a trade program and took care of my dog.

She recently signed an apartment lease with a friend and did not tell me. Instead, she initiated an argument , then said ""ok, I'm moving out"". Move in day is two months ahead and she hasn't paid the deposit yet. I found out about the pre-signed apartment from the friend who is unemployed. My sister works 20 hours a week but is poor with money management and is not ready to live alone w/o assistance while going to school full time. Her only expense is gas and personal entertainment and she rarely has more than a few dollars saved. Their plan to afford the apartment is ""we'll figure it out"" with excess student loans which cover about 15% of their needs.

Without her I can't travel for work and I'll take a 30-40% loss in income so I'll have very limited resources to help her or my brother.

7,1cyhnjy,AITA for not ‘participating’ in my brothers birthday?,"
Basically the plan was for my parents and brother to pick me up from work and then we’d go have dinner. I got in the car I could see my mom was upset. we got to the restaurant and I asked mom if she was upset and she said we would talk outside once seated. We sat and then mom and I went. she said that my brother said that he didn’t want to go to the restaurant. And kept going on about how it seemed like I manipulated her into thinking he wanted to go to the restaurant when he didn’t and I was confused because that isn’t what my brother and I spoke about. I tried telling my mom a month prior my brother said he wanted to go to the specific restaurant and how that wasn’t possible because of his work and he said ‘well maybe we can go for my birthday’ and last weekend I brought the idea up of us going on Saturday to celebrate his birthday and he said he was fine with it but we didn’t go on Saturday. So he said ‘maybe we can go Monday or Tuesday’ but we were both working. So we decided on today and we were both talking about it all week which is why I told my mom he wanted to go to the restaurant for his birthday. 

My mom was not understanding and told me it was my responsibility to make sure that he in fact wanted to go there and confirm with him. I said we were planning all week and if he didn’t want to go he should’ve said something sooner. She said that she felt manipulated and used. I was upset and told her feelings weren’t correct because that’s not what happened and she told me I wasn’t validating her feelings as she was invalidating mine. We went inside and I turned away from everyone and was not engaging because I was beyond upset.

Basically the plan was for my parents and brother to pick me up from work and then we’d go have dinner. I got in the car I could see my mom was upset. we got to the restaurant and I asked mom if she was upset and she said we would talk outside once seated. We sat and then mom and I went. she said that my brother said that he didn’t want to go to the restaurant. And kept going on about how it seemed like I manipulated her into thinking he wanted to go to the restaurant when he didn’t and I was confused because that isn’t what my brother and I spoke about. I tried telling my mom a month prior my brother said he wanted to go to the specific restaurant and how that wasn’t possible because of his work and he said ‘well maybe we can go for my birthday’ and last weekend I brought the idea up of us going on Saturday to celebrate his birthday and he said he was fine with it but we didn’t go on Saturday. So he said ‘maybe we can go Monday or Tuesday’ but we were both working. So we decided on today and we were both talking about it all week which is why I told my mom he wanted to go to the restaurant for his birthday. 

My mom was not understanding and told me it was my responsibility to make sure that he in fact wanted to go there and confirm with him. I said we were planning all week and if he didn’t want to go he should’ve said something sooner. She said that she felt manipulated and used. I was upset and told her feelings weren’t correct because that’s not what happened and she told me I wasn’t validating her feelings as she was invalidating mine. We went inside and I turned away from everyone and was not engaging because I was beyond upset.

8,1cyhlro,"AITA for telling my younger brother to “grow up”
","Am I (27F) the asshole for telling my younger brother that he needs to grow up, get a job, and move out? He is 23 years old and still living with my parents. I wouldn't have an issue with that if he was working, had a license, or ever left the house-- but he doesn't. In fact, he's becoming borderline agoraphobic because he spends every day playing video games in his bedroom. I'm really worried about his mental health if he continues this way.

My mom and dad were ""helicopter"" parents. My brother was born deaf with a rare form of hearing loss. He was premature and sick. My parents never psychologically got past controlling every aspect of his environment to protect him, and now he has low self-esteem and thinks he isn't capable of doing anything for himself. He also has trauma from being the only deaf person in school and feeling isolated. He's completely stuck; my encouragement and his monthly therapy sessions aren't cutting it. My parents now see the error of their ways, but it's too late for that. The damage is done. As compensation for their guilt, they buy him whatever he wants, pay for all his expenses, and don't charge him rent-- which just exacerbates his issues.

Today, my brother and my dad got into an argument because my brother said he wants to smoke weed in the house. For context, my dad does not use any substances because his father was an abusive addict. I believe that my dad has the right to feel safe and comfortable in his own home, despite his failing to instill independence in his son. My dad told my brother that “the day you smoke in my house is the day you pack your things and move out”. My brother texted me this evening to look for sympathy. I told him that if he didn't like Dad's rules, he could set up a plan for himself to move out and that I was willing to help him apply for housing assistance (not the first time I've offered). I told him that I'm sick of having this conversation and mediating between him and my parents. I also told him that if he wants independence, he needs to take some baby steps by researching some jobs he might be interested in and studying for his written driver's permit test. I told him that he needs to “stop acting like a child, or you’ll always be treated like one”. He comes back with ""I'm not asking you to be involved at f-ing all nor do I want you to be"". Then he started to tear up and left (I live a walkable distance from my parents).   

I’ve dedicated my career to working with young people with significant challenges and helping them succeed, but I can't seem to do this same for my own brother. I feel like a failure. Am I being an asshole to my brother? Should I have backed off? I recognize that he has trauma, but we can't all live in the past.

9,1cyh6dv,AITA for wanting to get a tattoo?,"Hi,

  
I'm an 18 year old active duty U.S. service member. Recently, I told my parents about my plans to get a sleeve tattoo done. My reasons for doing so have to do with the cultural and symbolic importance of the imagery I want depicted, and just the fact that I've wanted to get some ink my entire life. Plenty of people around me have tattoos, and I find it to be a very effective artistic and expressive medium for a person. After telling my parents about my plan, my mother was pretty neutral about it but my father seemed disappointed. Later on that evening, I called again as I usually do just to say good night, talk about the day, etc., and when my Mother asked my Father if he wanted to talk to me, he said he didn't want to. This was the first time that's ever happened. I've always had a very good relationship with my father, and he's always been encouraging of what I do, no matter what. It was a weird hearing him say that, and it kind of hurt. 

I understand why he feels the way he does. He doesn't like tattoos and has made that abundantly clear on many occasions, due to cultural reasons and the stigma associated with them. But I'm an adult, I have the means to do it comfortably and I'm not really jeopardizing my finances by doing it. I've thought on it for a very long time now, and I know I want to. But it's not worth being disowned to me. I'm not sure if he would, but he refuses to talk to me currently.

She has immense guilt about it and it hasnt been until recently that she feels a little more comfortable buying herself new underwear, bras, clothes, and makeup.

The other day I noticed a transaction come through on our shared credit card while my wife was at work. It was for Starbucks and over 7$. I texted her immediately to see if that was her, as I thought it may have been fraudulent activity since she so rarely goes to Starbucks or anywhere like that. There is a Starbucks in the same building at her work. She has worked at this place for over 2 years and has never bought anything from the Starbucks or cafeteria. She always packs lunch and brings her own coffee.

The next morning, I made fun of the price of the coffee. I said, sarcastically, ""hope that was a really good coffee for 7$!"" I saw her expression change, and tried to give her a side hug. She got really quiet and looked sad. She took our kids to school and then texted me from the gym afterwards explaining that she only went because her friends had invited her. She also pointed out that my cans of tobacco chew are more than 7$ and that I get several each week. She then did the math and figured that I spend over 700$ on chew a year. I apologized via text.

11,1cyh61k,AITA - for lying about my due date to my MIL,"My (29F) MIL lives in a different country along with their whole family. During our wedding last year she was extremely disrespectful towards me in ways I’m not even going to bother mentioning. 

In March I was in their country visiting with my husband- we found out I was pregnant there. I was 7 weeks when I found out, we told his mom dad and sisters right away. Only because we were there another week and it was better to tell them in person of course. 

My husband and I asked my in laws to keep this personal info to themselves until I’m 12 weeks at least. I told them not to tell a single other person, as I hadn’t even told my mom yet. They said okay. 

The next day all of my husbands cousins on his moms side started messaging me on Instagram.. “congratulations”. My jaw dropped and I almost dropped my phone. 

Im also high risk pregnancy- I have PCOS, a high BMI and many other factors. So I was extremely nervous that I wouldn’t even make it to 12 weeks. 

I told my husband he was very upset and called his mom and yelled at her. She didn’t even apologize at all 

Fast forward, I’m 18 weeks now. They asked me the due date when I went for my scan I told them I’m due in mid November.. though I’m due in Mid October. 

My MIL, FIL and sister in laws will be flying in in November thinking they will be here for the birth. But baby will be one month old by then. 

I did this because I know she won’t be giving me any privacy and will make everything about herself. I know she’ll absolutely help with nothing. She doesn’t do any house work at home.. she had a maid. Let alone help me. So her coming here will just make me more stressed during birth week.

I’m home with my family for summer break from college. I found out while with my bf and my brother.

I was on the phone with my parents that were at work. They told me the cost and asked me to pay it.

I said no way. It’s way too much money.

I asked if they could cover the cost but my parents said they unfortunately have a lot of bills and expenses and I have a good amount in savings.

I have around 5k from student loans, my parents, jobs, etc. But I pay rent and it feels like money goes by really fast. I asked again if they would pay it, but they said no.

So I didn’t ask him. But I asked my BF. I said it’s a lot of money, would you pay for it?

He said that I have the money on my own, I should just pay for it since I have savings.

My brother agreed. But I said you are my boyfriend. Don’t you want to help me? 

He said I never help with his car expenses, so I should probably just pay it. I said I could help going forward, but it would be really nice of him to cover it and it would show his faith in the relationship.

My brother snapped at me, “What are you doing to show your loyalty in this relationship?” I was taken aback and said we were having a conversation. He could mind his business.

I have no idea what upset him so bad. I was totally confused. I told him to chill the hell out. I wasn’t talking to him.

My bf said he has a lot of expenses, too, and stuff he has to pay and he can’t work much because he’s taking a lot of classes. He said I can help you out with some of it. 

I said it was fine, I didn’t want his money anyway. My brother said “good, be a grown adult.” God, I have no idea what his deal is. He was being so rude and he’s usually not that rude.

I did pay it myself. But I’m 20 and in college. Fuck me for wanting help? JFC. I just asked if he would help pay, it shouldn’t be a big deal.

Due to some issues in our past I have no desire to let him know I moved or let him around Tom but I feel guilty because this is my son’s father. I want my son to have a father but I fear that his biological one might not be the best. As of right now I think keeping him out of Tom’s life is the best, does that make me the A hole. 


Edit: BD is not on the birth certificate. I am the only parent legally. In order to get custody he would have to prove paternity. So right now he has no legal say in Tom’s life. He has made no effort to get a paternity test. ",0.0,1.0262438,1,0
15,1cygk7v,AITA partner is always grumpy/upset with me ,"We both work full time jobs and she is upset that she is doing all the cooking and cleaning. I work a physical labor job and she has a desk job. We both love our jobs but mine leaves me physically tired by the end of the day since I’m constantly doing physical labor and only sit down for a 30 min lunch. I also wake up 3 hours earlier and get home an hour later. Which leaves me with less time and less energy to do those extra necessary things that must be done. I’m sure the answer would be to split the work but then I feel like maintaining a 6 acre lawn (such as mowing and trimming should be split too) that’s a lot of work and I feel like it’s just overlooked. Dealing with someone who’s constantly grumpy is just emotionally draining after having a long day. Not sure how to go about improving this. Am I the asshole for not doing more on a daily basis for the house?

But the moment he heard that, he started going into a tangent about how the state of Florida was racist towards black people and Jewish people and that I would rather risk my life in a racist state for an amusement park ride instead of going to visit him. Mind you, I'm black, but I'm not Jewish, and I've been to Florida and lived there without any troubles or being treated in a racist way.

He mentioned my trip to Universal Studios Hollywood in 2023 for the opening day of Super Nintendo World and how I went there instead of visiting him in Seattle.

Mind you, I don't want to visit him because he's controlling and feels entitled to tell people (family and friends) how they should spend their money and how much food they should be allowed to eat on an outing. He will also complain about anything that isn't what he wants to do.

I went to his dad's funeral cause I was close to his mom, brother, and dad. and when he came for his job interview, I drove an hour from my town after work, no less to see him.

This weekend, we were all at my parents house and I was drawing with my niece. For context, she has a pretty mild cleft lip - enough to be noticeable, but not enough that it has had a significant impact on her life.

I feel really bad because she is obviously self conscious about it. I don't bring it up if she doesn't and I handle the topic with care - not that I think much about it anyway. She's my niece and I love her, end of story.

She asked me to draw her, but specified that she did not want me to include her cleft lip. I do not think it's my place to force her to be uncomfortable about something she struggles with, so after me asking ""are you sure? it's still a beautiful part of you' she insisted she didn't want me to draw it so I obliged.

When my sister came in the room and asked about the drawing she seemed annoyed and pulled me aside to ask why I would draw such a thing. I just said that niece asked me to not draw it and didn't feel it was my place to fight so that was that.

We get to the movie theater and it was practically empty so we take our time to buy popcorn. I buy it for myself but it’s huge so I ask her 3 times if she doesn’t want to share it with me.
She says that it’s too heavy since it’s the first thing she would eat the whole day and gets a grain mix pack. 
We get into the movie room, sit down and after 15 minutes of trailer she says she will get mozzarella sticks for herself. I said ok.

After she leaves there’s one more trailer and then the room gets dark and we receive the usual warning to turn off our phones so I put my phone inside my bag and on silence mode. A couple of minutes later the movie starts.
After 5 minutes I receive a notification on my Apple Watch. She’s asking for me to let her know when the movie starts. I tell her it had already.
She comes back minutes later angry and whispers at me that I was inconsiderate and should have told her immediately when it started.

She missed 2 scenes that I summarize in a sentence but I don’t feel bad because she left knowing eventually the movie would start and she took a risk.

So for context I love my grandchild but she has autism. Because of this she doesn’t like going out and so going to restaurants is very hard as she will throw tantrums and have very loud meltdowns. 
I’m turning 80 and this is a big moment for me and I really want to enjoy my birthday without having to cater to my granddaughters specific needs. The restaurant I want to go to doesn’t have her safe foods and she is 7 so I know she will want to eat.

The main reason I don’t want to invite my DIL (mother of my grandchild) is because recently she just keeps on telling me of all the family members who have died at my age and how she would be mortified and depressed if she ever lived up to my age. Last year we had a small family party for my birthday and she kept on saying how this will be my last birthday and how sad everyone would be next year because I most likely wouldn’t be there. I have asked my son to tell her to knock it off that it’s very rude and mean but she doesn’t stop.

I’m not stupid I’m sure I’m going to die in the next couple of years but I’m not gonna die right now. I just want a nice dinner at around six on the 1st of June with my son and my daughter. 

We can do like a lunch with my grandchild and DIL in the afternoon so that way I’m not excluding anyone.

My SIL is fine and told me that he’s not joining so that my DIL doesn’t feel excluded which I think is fair but my DIL is saying I’m being rude and entitled and that she’s only saying fact and that I’m a awful person for not wanting my granddaughter to be around. My son is on my side but this is getting too much.

These kids have been in the hallways screeching (I am talking stuck pig, would’ve called the police fearing child endangerment kind of screeching) at midnight or even 1am on weeknights. The parents do nothing about it. To put it gently, these kids think they can do whatever they want, no consequences. 

Summer is arriving, and the weather has been great. The kids across from me have also been enjoying this weather, except they’re “enjoying” it so much that one of them (11 year old) has taken to blocking the parking spots in my complex by parking his bike in the middle of one and standing there on his phone for hours. The parents watch this happen, the dad SOMETIMES goes out and bring the bike back into their apartment late at night. Emphasis on sometimes. I’ve talked to them about this, as recently I’ve had to park over five, ten minutes away from my building because of the kid taking up an entire parking spot. The father shrugs and laughs, and does nothing about it. 

Next point is where I am unsure if I’m the asshole.  

Our complex has strict rules about personal items taking up public spaces (planters, grills, and most relevantly bikes.) They’ve sent emails stating they’re not responsible for reimbursing personal items removed from the public spaces. 

I came home from a particularly stressful day, and the kid was in the only spot left near my building. I asked him nicely to move his bike so I could park. The kid stared at me, then laughed as he left his bike and went inside. His father watched all of this from their patio and did nothing.

After parking 3 buildings over, I’d had enough. I called the complex and reported a bike taking up parking. Within half an hour, maintenance came and took it. 

Next morning I woke up to screeching from this kid. His dad realized what happened and came over to yell at me. Pissed at being woken up at 7am on my one day off, I responded “play stupid games win stupid prizes” before I shut the door and went about my day. 

Part of me feels justified, but theres part of me that feels bad this kid won’t have a bike for the majority of this summer. 

AITA?

TL:DR kid acted like he owned the parking lot, got a rude awakening when his bike was thrown away by maintenance, and his dad who encouraged the behavior is pissed.

Growing up, I had massive social difficulties, no friends and really struggled school.  

As a kid, all throughout primary school my mum made me invite all the girls in my class to birthday parties to try help me build friendships. Not once did I ever receive an invite in return, nor did anyone outside my family ever wish me a happy birthday. In 6th grade I stopped celebrating my birthday altogether. Every year it was just a huge slap in the face.

This whole social thing is a massive issue, did not improve at all during high school, and while I do have some sort of friends that I see every now and then, we are not exactly close. I'm working on it, but at this point it is more of an acceptance thing than an improvement thing.

Anyway, my sister is nothing like me. Extremely popular, loads of friends etc. We are relatively close, but our birthdays have always caused me to feel pretty down. Mine is two weeks before hers and she always threw big parties, while I pretty much ignore mine. I always attend though, because it makes my sister happy and she does want me there.

This year, for my 20th, I decided to reach out to a couple of casual friends I have made at uni to try organise just going out for a few drinks. All of them agreed but as the date got closer, everyone dropped out due to other obligations. Not a great feeling.

My sister on the other hand, for her 18th, planned a house party with a big group of friends. I was supposed to be there but the moment people started arriving, I couldn't handle it and left (we both live at  home still).

Nana is sympathetic, but my sister and the rest of our family are pissed that I left. Saying that it was rude, I need to get my issues together, stop sulking, can't hide from life, that I'm being selfish and making it about me etc.

It's normal in my country to live in your parents' house until you get married. We recently moved into a new house and I have to share a room with my sister. I got a loft bed as the room is too small and there would be almost no space between our beds otherwise. I got this bed with the intention of putting a desk and PC in the space under the bed and using it as a mini office, particularly as I work from home. My sister didn't show any opposition but only said it's a stupid idea as I will fall and gaining weight would make it inconvenient to go up and down. I said it's my issue and I'm willing to risk it.

Now here's where it might be my fault, I proposed that she get her bed under mine kind of like forming a cross to free up more space in the room to get a big cupboard. She was opposed to the idea but then relented. This was months ago and her bed had yet to arrive so she was sleeping on the floor. 

Later, she said she refuses to get a big cupboad as she has no need for it and it's more money, so I said she can leave under my bed and I'll stick to my original plan. All this time, she had been sleeping on her mattress on the floor but under my bed. She refuses to leave.

Her bed is arriving tomorrow and she insists on having it be under my bed. I refuse for various reasons, not only would I not be getting any use out of it since we cancelled the idea of a big cupboard, but also because in this period of time, there have been some incidents which showed it wasn't a good idea to have her under my bed.

For instance, my glasses once fell off and they fell on her while she was sleeping, so she woke me up cursing and screaming. I believe it's inevitable for things to occasionally fall off the bed and if she doesn't want things falling on her head, she better leave under my bed. 

She refuses as she says she will feel as though I can watch her from above and it will make her unable to sleep. She never mentioned this before I got the bed.

Her bed is arriving tomorrow and I refuse to let it be installed under my bed, shich I paid double the money I would have paid for a normal bed to get. I paid the money and I'm the one dealing with the inconvenience of having to go up and down everyday, so I believe I deserve to use the space under my bed.

I have talked to about 10 people already and they have either ended in ghosting, an agreement that the two of us would be better of friends, or them deciding to stay with someone else.

To the average college freshman I’m a pretty undesirable roommate. I go to bed around 9:30 PM so I can get up for swim practice at 6 AM (something that will continue in college) and I don’t really like to party. I’m not going to a school where there’s tons of athletes, so it’s been hard to find someone who will also fit my schedule. 

A few days ago, my mom saw this other mom’s Facebook post about her daughter wanting to find a roommate. Despite the fact that I asked my mom to not get involved in the roommate process multiple times, she just couldn’t help herself.

I decided a long time ago that I wanted to have a randomly selected roommate. It saves me time and energy. Plus, if it turns out we aren’t compatible, we can go our separate ways. Since my mom connected with this other mom, she has been driving me insane about connecting with this woman’s daughter. 

Just to get my mom off my back, we exchanged a couple of Instagram messages, but it was very clear to me that this girl was not looking for compatibility, but just to get the process over with. She also came across as a little judgmental of some of my responses. My mom is insisting that I don’t know her and I need to FaceTime with her in order to actually get to know her. 

I have no interest in doing this. I’m fine with my choice to have a random roommate, but my mom is not. She has quite literally been screaming at me to FaceTime with this girl. Just today my mom sent me a text about FaceTiming with the girl and when I didn’t answer it, my mom sent the exact same text an hour later. 

I really do believe that my mom is trying to live vicariously through me. She keeps mentioning that when she went to college she didn’t have the opportunity to choose a roommate, so I’m being selfish and stubborn by not taking my opportunity to do so. Personally, I don’t think it’s that deep, but I’m get so fed up with being yelled at. 

I also asked my mom politely to let me be an adult and do this process by myself. She has refused to let me do that and has been continuously messaging this mom on Facebook saying that I would love to talk to her daughter.

Now my other neighbor we used to get on very well. Recently we been having issues  the driveway is shared. 

Issues.
Neighbours friends family and others have parked in our driveway or blocked it.

I have mentioned if they need to use it let us know because we usually park in the garage or we are out.

In my head I thought they would ask but a few time one of the people there would park. Once blocking my spouse in the garage and made her late for work.

I have asked that they don't use the driveway or block us.

They are extending what little grass the have on their side. 

I spoke to the contractors today just asked them not to block or use the drive way.


I sent a msg to my neighbor just saying hey please tell you workers not to impede our ability to get access to our drive way.

My spouse said to delete it.

And let it be. So I deleted it.

The weight sent a bunch of msgs saying how she never had problems with the neighbors before and how things have changed between us and I'm alway on their case. Also I'm not allowed to talk to her contractors.

I see it as hey it's my drive way please don't use it or block it without a heads up.

I feel like they have been entitled for so long with the previous neighbors. I just want to be left alone at this point.

30,1cz5agj,AITA for telling my mum she’s sabotaging my career?,"For context my mum grew up without an education. Most of the older women in both sides of my family were raised to be just housewives. That’s pretty much all they know.

She’s taught me from a young age how to cook and clean for my older brothers and dad and raise my younger siblings with her. Meanwhile my OLDER brothers have absolutely zero life skills and require me to do everything for them. Cooking, cleaning, laundry etc.

Every exam season she complains I go to the library too often but when I stay home to study she won’t leave me alone. She gives me chores one after the other and waste all my time on house chores! It doesn’t help that we have a big family so there’s a never ending amount of chores . The day I realised she had it out for me was a few years ago when I came home from my part time job and my mum gave me a list of things to complete before she returned night. I just broke down since I was just a frustrated teen who had a long day and dealing with exam stress and now this. My brother(20 at the time) for the first time ever stepped in and offered to help out by cleaning just the kitchen. He told my mum the next day and she convinced him I was crying fake tears and called me a manipulative drama queen for tricking her son into cleaning. They both teased me for the next few weeks saying I’m such a liar.

Now I’m in university halfway done with my degree but my mum is still the same. I can’t get any work done at home but she guilt trips me everytime I want to study outside.

For context my mum grew up without an education. Most of the older women in both sides of my family were raised to be just housewives. That’s pretty much all they know.

She’s taught me from a young age how to cook and clean for my older brothers and dad and raise my younger siblings with her. Meanwhile my OLDER brothers have absolutely zero life skills and require me to do everything for them. Cooking, cleaning, laundry etc.

Every exam season she complains I go to the library too often but when I stay home to study she won’t leave me alone. She gives me chores one after the other and waste all my time on house chores! It doesn’t help that we have a big family so there’s a never ending amount of chores . The day I realised she had it out for me was a few years ago when I came home from my part time job and my mum gave me a list of things to complete before she returned night. I just broke down since I was just a frustrated teen who had a long day and dealing with exam stress and now this. My brother(20 at the time) for the first time ever stepped in and offered to help out by cleaning just the kitchen. He told my mum the next day and she convinced him I was crying fake tears and called me a manipulative drama queen for tricking her son into cleaning. They both teased me for the next few weeks saying I’m such a liar.

Now I’m in university halfway done with my degree but my mum is still the same. I can’t get any work done at home but she guilt trips me everytime I want to study outside.

31,1cz4y3q,AITA for not waking my wife up and letting her sleep the whole day?,"Using a theowaway for obvious reasons. Just a quick background info: My wife (Heather - 36F) and I (35F) have been together for the past 14 years, and married for 10. We have two daughters ( 4 and 6 years old) together.

Heather is a doctor and she works ridiculously long hours, gets tired, etc. Yesterday she came back home after being away all day (she was on call and needed to go in for an emergency surgery), and told me she was going to sleep for a couple of hours and asked me to wake her up by dinner so she could see the girls and I a bit.

She slept around 5 PM. I tried to wake her at 7 PM. I called for her, softly shook her, gave her a kiss on the cheek but she didn't get up. (She is a very light sleeper ans these things wake her up 90% of the time). I thought she needed the rest and let her sleep. Heather slept until the next morning which is when she needed to go to work.

Heather was very upset the following morning saying I should have woken her up, and that I had caused her to miss an entire day of family time. I explained that she didn't get up and she said I just should have tried harder to wake her. 

I get that she wants to be present in our family (and she is) and she wants out kids to see both their moms but I just wanted to let her get some much needed sleep to help her be well rested for the next day. Was I genuinely the AH?

32,1cz4rst,AITA For Judging My Friend," I (21, F) have a friend (20, F) who we will call Katy has been dating her partner (21, nonbinary) who we will call Sam for a year. We lived together this year and plan on doing so again for the next year. She is my best friend although she can be a bit turbulent. I spend a lot of time with both Katy and Sam together since we basically all live together and I witness how Katy treats Sam in a way that I consider to be poor. I know that it is not my place to comment on their relationship so I don’t share my opinion of Katy’s behavior when she approaches me about situation.
Katy had been telling me that one of my friends had a crush on her. They began noticeably flirting with one another and I confronted Katy about it and asked if she had feelings for this friend and she said no. However, I noticed Katy wasn’t inviting Sam to group hangout where this friend would be present.
Soon after Katy told me that she and Sam had broken up. Over the next week, Katy stayed in contact with Sam but continued to talk about the possibility of getting with the friend days after the break up. I told Katy that it might be best to move on and limit contact with Sam. Not even a week after the breakup Katy came to my room asking me if I could leave the apartment since the friend was coming over. Needless to say, they slept together. Katy was not happy with the experience and the next morning she told me that she and Sam would be getting back together since the experience helped her realize that breaking up was a mistake. Since Katy went through Sam’s  phone and found their friends messages saying that Katy broke up with Sam to sleep with the friend and honestly, I kinda agree. Katy had been talking about the potential romantic feelings between this friend and her for weeks before the breakup and got back with Sam the same night they slept together. It feels like Katy only got back with Sam because she was disappointed with the experience. Sam’s friend also said that Sam had been having panic attacks, vomiting, and crying since the breakup and thought that Katy was acting in cruelty.
 Katy screenshotted and annotated the messages and confronted Sam about in an Ulta while I was there saying that the conversation was inappropriate. She contacted Sam’s friend and it resulted in Sam being blocked and outted from the friend group. Since then, Katy has told me privately in some terms that she feels like she can do anything and Sam will forgive her. She shows no remorse and zero empathy for Sam who has been sick and missing work since the incident. Sam has lost friends and family connections and as far as I know nobody in Sam’s close circle thinks that Katy is good for Sam.
I am now concerned that Katy is toxic person but I am also worried that eventually this behavior will turn on to me. I don’t know if I would be an asshole for distancing myself from my friend for a situation that does not involve me or for casting judgement on to my friend.

I think I am the asshole for not being clean enough, but I don’t appreciate the way he has communicated that. He has been giving me the silent treatment almost immediately since we moved in (in October 2023). 

When I talk to my friends about this, they take my side and I don’t trust that

Yesterday we had a house meeting and he was like “can I start the meeting?” then pulled out a letter he had written. He started off by saying that I disgust him, and called me a slob. He said he feels unsafe and unhealthy and he wants me to move out

His complaints:

I leave my container of hair gel on the bathroom sink

I haven’t cleaned the bathroom (this was sort of a psychological war and I’m not sure why neither of us did it. It was disgusting and unacceptable)

When I did clean the bathroom, I didn’t do it well enough

There are empty TP rolls on the floor near the garbage can

My towel falls off the rack onto the floor and I don’t pick it up quickly enough

I leave my shoes in the hallway

I left a belt on the chair outside my room

I’m just not sure this rises to the level of “disgusting” or unsafe? He also told me I never do chores, which is untrue, and my other roommates backed that up, although they didn’t really stick up for me, which makes me feel like it’s probably just my problem. If 1 person has a problem with you it could be them, but if 3 roommates dislike you, it’s you.

He has barely communicated his issues with me— some of these he hasn’t told me about at all— and he said it’s because it’s not his job to do that, and I should’ve paid attention when he laid out his cleanliness standards. If I enter the room he will leave and if I say something he will pretend I don’t exist. 

Sometimes he will send me pictures of mess that he thinks is mine and asked me why I have to be told to clean up after myself. I tell him that it’s not my mess and he tells me it’s because he doesn’t trust me and believes I am dirty


Again I am really going back and forth about whether I am the only asshole here. I agree I have bad habits but I would assume no worse than other roommates including him. But the fact that the others were barely sticking up for me makes me feel like it probably is me. I don’t want to be delusional. Imo, I’ve had roommates that were messier than me (according to everyone else) but I would NEVER deal with them like this.

39,1cz2oep,WIBTA—Not attend brother’s wedding,"My (34F) brother (37M) have always had a rollercoaster of a relationship. Sometimes we get along and sometimes it’s like world war three.

I wanted to attend my nephew’s preschool graduation yesterday. My brother told me “sure” I could come but got mad at my mom for her telling me about the graduation. He told her that him and his fiancé are trying to distance themselves from me. I did not attend the graduation after I heard this. They always tell my mom they have a problem with me but never tell me they have an issue with me. This has been going on for 10 years and now that I have a family of my own, I’m over the dramatics of it all. 

We were all getting along until sometime in October when his fiancé started ignoring me and refusing to talk to me. I was pregnant and tried to avoid the drama and just accept it for what it is. However I really care about my nephews and would love to be in their life but also respect the parents if they don’t want me to be. However they never directly tell me this or tell me something is wrong. They just start treating me differently. It’s hurtful and confusing. 

Their wedding is this weekend. Why would I attend a wedding of someone who obviously doesn’t want me around and is trying to distance themselves from me, my fiancé, and newborn? I’m aware that if I don’t attend this will be the end of any relationship I have with them and I think I’m okay with that because I can’t keep doing this whiplash of them being nice for a few months or a year and then I do something to upset them and they block me out of their lives without telling me what the problem is. They obviously don’t care about the relationship or they’d want to talk about it and work it out.

Christmas came, I had brought him something “from the kids” - some whisky, a decanter, things he asked for before. He got me supermarket gift set of body wash, lotion & bath salts. Not even a brand I used. Not even wrapped. 
I left it as it’s “the thought that counts” (even if said supermarket was a 3 minute walk from my house).

His birthday is end of December, I got him another gift “from the kids”.

My birthday is January. I received nothing.

I told my mum this in a passing conversation. She was shocked he hadn’t as it was just “the thing you did.” My siblings are from a previous relationship and she and her ex partner brought things “from the kids” for the occasions.

Mother’s Day (I’m in the UK) came in the march. I received supermarket chocolates. Again, from the supermarket 3mins from my house.

Father’s Day came (this was last year, 2023) and he had since moved back home to Ireland, so I sent over a personalised card with pictures of him and the kids, and also a personalised bottle of wine.
He thanked me for it and said it was really kind and that I “didn’t have to.”

Roll on the remaining months, Christmas again. The kids were spending New Years with him so I took the kids with me to buy a present for him and a birthday present. Found them, wrapped them, and the kids took them off to Ireland. No present for me.

This year? My birthday rolled around again (I hate I’m getting older) and I received yet again nothing. 
I told my mum again and she was upset yet again. 

Mother’s Day was coming closer and my youngest let slip there was a present for me. I got excited, hoping my ex had given the kids something to bring over, or given my eldest some money to get something. Or maybe my eldest who is 14 got me something himself. That seemed like the more plausible thing.

Mother’s Day arrived and I received a cute card (Bluey one as I love the show!) and some chocolates. Ok, nothing fancy. But it was something. A few weeks later my youngest let slip (5 year olds can’t keep secrets) that nana had helped with my present.

I was thankful my mum had brought me something, but hurt my ex didnt think about doing it, even though I’ve always brought him something “from the kids”.

After thinking since March, I’ve decided I’m not getting him anything for Father’s Day. Why should I when he can’t do the same for me on these days!? I do think about the gifts, not get him bog standard “dad stuff” tin or “no1 dad” mug & coaster.

47,1cz1b2w,AITA for prioritizing my dog’s recovery over visitors? ,"My husband and I just welcomed our first child 4 days ago on Sunday 5/19. She arrived just short of 38 weeks and I had no signs of impending labor just days before so her arrival surprised us a bit but we’re both happy and healthy. My husband and I also have a 5 year old dachshund, Oliver who we are completely obsessed with. Oliver gets regular allergy shots and had an appointment on Monday which I had planned to take him to but obviously that changed when the baby arrived. I want to keep him on his medication schedule and knew things would be chaotic with a newborn at home so I asked my parents (we live in a 2 family home with them) to bring him for his appointment. While in the waiting room of the vet’s office, he was attacked by a much larger dog and sustained serious injuries. He was rushed into surgery immediately. The entire thing was so traumatic- finding out he was injured while I was away in the hospital was one of the worst moments of my life. I made my husband go and be there at the vet’s office while I waited anxiously in the hospital. Luckily he pulled through and is recovering as well as possible but he has a long road to recovery.

I was discharged the next day and he was able to come home yesterday. Having a baby in the house is a huge adjustment for us all, including Oliver, though he has been shocking us with how well he’s doing especially while in the midst of a recovery. It has been really hard for my husband and I to make sure everyone’s needs are met but we’re managing with some help from my parents. Things are going as well as can be expected after a stressful week. However, one thing that’s causing a lot of stress is visitors. My hospital still had strict visiting rules after Covid so all the relatives who couldn’t visit want to visit at home. However, Oliver gets extremely excited to see anyone who comes over and we have been instructed to keep him quiet and calm right now so that he can heal. Additionally, we are exhausted from taking care of both. When our daughter is napping we spend all our time with him as he recovers. We decided that right now is not the time to have visitors. But we’ve gotten some nasty replies from family saying we’re prioritizing a dog over our daughter’s relationship with her family (she’s a newborn, she doesn’t know any different and these aren’t immediate family members) and that they can’t believe we’d put a dog over them. They tell me I’ll be a bad mom for prioritizing Oliver and that breaks my heart because I love my baby so much but I also love Oliver to death too. My in laws live out of state and will meet baby in July so the people being pushed off aren’t grandparents, they’re my husband’s siblings and aunts and uncles on both sides. If it weren’t for Oliver’s injuries, we probably would allow select visitors with certain precautions but he is our first baby and we want to make this time as stress free for him.

It has been really hard for my husband and I to make sure everyone’s needs are met but we’re managing with some help from my parents. Things are going as well as can be expected after a stressful week. However, one thing that’s causing a lot of stress is visitors. My hospital still had strict visiting rules after Covid so all the relatives who couldn’t visit want to visit at home. However, Oliver gets extremely excited to see anyone who comes over and we have been instructed to keep him quiet and calm right now so that he can heal. Additionally, we are exhausted from taking care of both. When our daughter is napping we spend all our time with him as he recovers. We decided that right now is not the time to have visitors. But we’ve gotten some nasty replies from family saying we’re prioritizing a dog over our daughter’s relationship with her family (she’s a newborn, she doesn’t know any different and these aren’t immediate family members) and that they can’t believe we’d put a dog over them. They tell me I’ll be a bad mom for prioritizing Oliver and that breaks my heart because I love my baby so much but I also love Oliver to death too. My in laws live out of state and will meet baby in July so the people being pushed off aren’t grandparents, they’re my husband’s siblings and aunts and uncles on both sides. If it weren’t for Oliver’s injuries, we probably would allow select visitors with certain precautions but he is our first baby and we want to make this time as stress free for him. AITA for putting visitors on the back burner during this time? ",0.0,0.0625720098614692,0,1
48,1cz1700,AITA for telling my mum i’m too busy to do chores everyday,"I (24F) moved in with my parents after graduating 2 years ago. We have a household of 6 - Mom, Dad, Brother (21), Cousin (24M) & grandma. I have a stable job, good savings & bought a condo to rent out last year for some extra income. But the housing market is terrible, my tenants rent doesn’t cover the mortgage, and i’m currently sitting at a loss until i sell. In addition i help out with costs around the house and had to give my parents $23k to help with their mortgage because even though we’re upper middle class, my dad was out of work for a few years due to personal reasons and they needed help. Because of this, i can’t move out rn - doesn’t help that the canadian economy sucks - in case anyone says “why are you 24 and still living at home” its normal in my culture to live at home until you’re married or in a comfortable financial position. Because of my financial situation, i’ve had to take on more contract work and i’ve been working 60-80hr weeks. Also, i spend about 2-3 hours commuting to work from Thurs-Fri, so I don’t have much down time. The time i have for myself i spend resting, working out, practicing hobbies or seeing my friends/boyfriend. on average i spend about 45 mins/day working out, i see my boyfriend once a week or every other week, i try to hang out with one friend a week or every other week & the business im starting for brand design/graphics is me working on my hobbies so i try to give 1-2 hours a day.

Now, let’s get to my mother’s expectations of me. In my culture, the women are the ones who usually do the cooking and cleaning. my mum expects me to cook dinner for 6 of us at least every other day, clean the kitchen every night, clean the top floor of the house every weekend (vacuum/mop all the floors, clean my parents bedroom and deep clean their bathroom & clean the laundry room. we have 4 bedrooms upstairs & 2 in the basement) the boys do the other floors and cook on the nights me and my mum don’t cook. i understand that i need to contribute to the household, but im made to feel selfish on the days i don’t have the capacity to help and im told “are you the first person to have a job?” my dad provides financially for the household but because of recent events i’ve been asked to help out with things every now and then which i don’t mind and using my cards when they need help. the reason i’m living at home is to save money and i don’t feel like that’s the case anymore. on top of that my mum expects me to accompany her to her social or family friend events at least once every other week and i barely have enough time for myself. my mom said that if i was living alone id have to do all of the things she asks for, which is true, but i would be doing for one person & on my own time. not 6.

51,1cz0lgp,WIBTA for refusing to buy a late birthday gift for my son's classmate?,"I have three kids (8M, 5M and 1F). My younger son is friends with a classmate I'll call ""Mikey"". His brother ""James"" is in the same class as my older son, but they're not friends.

Back in March, the boys' mother informed the class' mom groupchat that James had the flu, and his birthday party would have to be canceled. My older son had not been invited to that party. My wife and I didn't even know about it until she saw the text. But since my son wasn't friends with James, we didn't mind it.

My younger son just got his invitation to Mikey's birthday party, which will take place in the first week of June. On it, there is a reminder to bring an additional gift for James.

Both me and my wife were confused. When we asked their parents about it, they said that since James didn't get to have his friends over for his own birthday, they wanted his friends to have the opportunity to give him gifts during Mikey's party.

Again, my older son is not friends with James and had not been invited to his canceled party, so we were never planning on giving him a gift in the first place. We didn't even know it was his birthday. Even if we were buying him a gift, we'd give it to him on some other occasion, not during his younger brother's party. It doesn't feel fair to Mikey.

Once my wife and I had agreed on that, we informed the boys' parents we wouldn't get a gift for James. We told them all our reasons, but they argued that we were being petty and vindictive, and that it was unfair to deprive James of a birthday gift just because our son doesn't like him (from what I gather, that's not the case).

Their mother is threatening to uninvite my younger son from Mikey's party over this. Their father is less harsh, but still thinks we should reconsider our decision.

53,1cyzykv,AITA for telling my girlfriend her friend is entitled?,"Me (17f) and my girlfriend (18f) have been dating for almost a year. We used to have a shared friendgroup, whom my girlfriend drifted apart from but I stayed very loyal to. She met a new group of friends, and I’m happy for her. The only problem is that all her new friends are assholes. She can’t see it because they are nice to her, but mean to literally everyone else around them. 

I have a friend (18m) that I’m very close with, Alex. Alex very badly wants to be friends with my girlfriend, so he asked to join the club that me, my girlfriend, and her new friends are in. My girlfriend of course let him in. He never talks much, but when he does, he talks about me to them and tries to include me in the conversation. We are both autistic and feel a sort of closeness/bond, he is very nervous in the new space with people he doesn’t know so he’s trying to make it more familiar to him by making me more involved. 

I always had the suspicion that my girlfriend doesn’t like Alex, nothing super huge, but like just little side eyes and glances I caught from time to time. Ever since my girlfriend became friends with these new people, she’s been acting very different. She’s argumentative, never calls me anymore, and replaced my name on social media with one of her friends names which really hurt but I don’t want to stir the pot anymore. 

Alex came to my house crying a few days ago and explained to me that my girlfriends friend (the one she replaced my name with) had kicked him from the club. When he asked why, the friend said “you said something that made me uncomfortable a while back.”. When Alex asked what he said, the friend refused to tell him.

(An important thing to note, Alex is not a native English speaker. He is Vietnamese. He is very paranoid about saying the wrong words and accidentally saying something bad like a slur or insulting someone on accident) 

I told my girlfriend to which she said that her friend was right, and she does have the right to kick anyone she pleases. But in my head, something about the way the friend said it and how much Alex was crying makes me think that the friend is entitled and thinks that owning a club makes them better than everyone.

These friends been my main friend group for the past couple of years, but I’ve been feeling off about them for the past 6 months or so. 

They are often passive aggressive and I feel as though they think I’m the “weird” one in the group. They obviously love me, but I can’t help but feel constant judgement from them. Maybe this is my own problem, but I don’t feel this way with other friends. 

We’ve had this road trip planned for a few months, but hadn’t talked about the prices of everything until a few weeks ago. The hotels are going to be a chunk of money, as well as gas and food. This would use up most of my summer money, and I am not sure if it is worth spending on this trip, as I don’t know if I am going to have fun. 

When we were planning, I was excited and not thinking about all the logistics. But, it’s going to be a lot of driving and constant time with my friends, who are not always the nicest. I know it’s super shitty to cancel on them, given the trip is in a month or so, and I cancelled a day trip with one of the friends last year, but I don’t want to spend money on something that’s not worth it. 

I’m transferring colleges next year, so I don’t have to see them again if I don’t want to. I like these friends but they make me feel shitty about myself a lot and I’m so torn. 

Would I be the Asshole if I cancelled? 


UPDATE: I just talked with one of my friends, and they understand my concerns. We both agreed that talking with the group as a whole would be the best option, and explaining to the other friends why I am concerned about going. I won’t be able to talk to them for another week due to busy schedules, but will update next week hopefully! Thanks for all the support! 

Also edit: The extra money costs shouldn’t be a problem for them, and it wouldn’t be too much extra, given it’s split among the rest of them.

Also edit: The extra money costs shouldn’t be a problem for them, and it wouldn’t be too much extra, given it’s split among the rest of them. Additionally, we would be using my car, but if I decide not to go, they do have other car options. ",0.0,0.0680359750986099,0,1
57,1cyyzyy,AITA for asking my GF “What’s the plan?”,"My gf and I are both in our 30’s and doing long distance. I am planning on moving to where she’s at relatively soon. Business for both of us has been pretty slow, so we’re a little lack in the financial department individually. Yesterday morning she calls me, barely says hello, and goes right into explaining her current situation and asked me for a couple hundred dollars. 

I’ve recently had some medical bills pile up, so I’m struggling a bit myself. I told her I don’t have it at the moment, but that I had a check I haven’t deposited yet that I can go cash and I can send her the money. Just so happens at the same time, an  insurance claim I had filed has come in, so I immediately now had the funds to give her. I told her I’m ready to transfer the money to her and then asked “so what’s the plan? I’m giving you this money, but how will you be making money after this and to eventually return the money?” 

Her response was “Nevermind I’ll figure it out”. So I said “babe, I’m fine helping you, but this isn’t a handout. It’s not to punish you or teach you a lesson, I too am struggling.” She got super upset at this. She said something along the lines of “I am asking for help from a man I want to build a life with and you asked when I will pay it back. It’s not really the help I wanted”. 

Call me crazy, but am I being gaslit here?  Anyway, an argument ensues, and we’ve been arguing ever since. We’ve only been dating a year. We aren’t married and we don’t live together yet. I guess this upsets me because she just expected me to give it to her no questions asked. She’s upset because I’m apparently as a man I’m supposed to help if needed. Was my question so wrong?

58,1cyyz3v,AITA for telling a petty classmate he’s still a loser?,"So there’s this classmate of mine who I first encountered back in 7th grade. He was kind of the social outcast type, the kid who sits at lunch alone and gets picked last for parter/group projects. One day during lunch, he asked my friend group if he could sit there and we said “sorry, someone else is sitting in this seat and we’re waiting for them”. He said ok and walked away.

The truth is we kind of just didn’t want to have him at our lunch table, he was chubby, not well dressed, awkward, and we’re not obligated to invite him out of pity. There was no one else in that spare seat, we just said that to let him down gently. Over the course of the school year he tried multiple times to join our friend group in other ways; group projects, gym teams, etc. And every time we had to come up with some way to reject him without outright saying it. By the time high school came along, he stopped approaching us, I think he finally got the message.



I didn’t hear much from him in the following years. He faded into obscurity. I recall hearing some vague rumor about Child Protective Services being called on his parents in 10th grade, but I don’t know if that rumor is true or anything.



He ended up really pulling his life together; he started working out, got an athletic body, and got accepted into a prestigious college. I received a DM from him on Insta saying “Hey it’s me from middle school, do you remember me?”. Then he went on this giant rant that went something like this:



”I’m surprised your shallow Regina George-stereotype ass remembers me, I thought people like you were too busy getting wasted at parties or whatever. I know you lied to me about that lunch table seat, because no one ever showed up there. And everything else, too. You’re the most spoiled stereotypical teenager I’ve ever known, and that says a lot because everyone around here always gets pampered by their friends and family while I just had to suffer alone. Guess what? It made me strong. You and your clique’s exclusion almost broke me, but I bounced back better than ever before. I wouldn’t sit at your shitty lunch table because I’d rather be working out at the MMA gym, going to Walmart or even just laying in bed. Did I mention how spoiled and privileged you are? I’ve lived through shit that would’ve killed your pampered ass who gets everything handed to them. But I lived through it and found greatness in adversity. Enjoy going to another one of your parties or whatever, you can get fucked for all I care. I’m off to pursue greater things in life.”



His whole rant was just rude, out of nowhere, and uncalled for, so I got fed up and said “If you’re still this pissed about some petty middle school drama, then you’re still as much of a loser as you were back then”. He replied with “Would \[his college\] with a single digit acceptance rate accept a loser? Your acceptance doesn’t mean shit to me when I have an acceptance letter from them”. After that he blocked me.

60,1cyyi0b,AITA if i argued w my mom on her bday for throwing away my leftovers,"i (20F) am back at my parents’ home for summer break, as i am doing an internship in a couple weeks near the area here. my mom (45F) wfh

a couple friends also traveled here with me to visit, we all arrived on sunday and they are leaving this morning (thursday) to go back to the city our college is in. on monday we tried out this nice korean restaurant, where i got to try tteokbokki for the first time. it was RLLY amazing, i could only have a couple bites tho as i wasn’t too hungry to start w and it was super filling so ofc i packed the rest for leftovers.

i figured my family would also want to try it as we all love spicy asian food, so they had like one bite each when i got back and i put the rest in the fridge for later

the next day i spent pretty much the entire day out with my friends, so i didn’t check the fridge at all. and then the following day i also spent out the whole time, but i did check the fridge and was surprised to see my tteokbokki wasn’t there. i didn’t think much of it bc i only glanced over the fridge quickly. i came back home late last night bc we were at a concert, so i didnt want to wake my parents but i noticed the leftovers were gone for real as i was trying to get something to eat, so i had to settle for sad ramen instead.

then today my friends left this morning and so i am finally all alone in my house, so i remembered to ask my mom abt my food and she said my dad (49M) told her to throw it out and she did.

i immediately got angry and upset, but i tried not to bc today is her bday, but we still got into an argument. her points were that i can’t keep takeout leftovers in the fridge for more than 2 days because they’ll go bad, which i think is ABSOLUTE bs bc i’ve been living off week-old leftovers in college. and then she said that i didn’t even like it and only brought the food for THEM to try, and i explained i literally did like it i was just not hungry atm but still wanted y’all to try some

she also called it unhealthy even tho she was talking abt having wendys earlier, and besides my leftovers literally had fish and so many vegetables in it. she even said my ramen was healthier too??

i think i may be irrationally more upset than i need to be and may be TA because a) i couldve asked days ago but today is her bday and i’m only picking a fight w her now, and b) my emotions r wonky bc all my friends are staying over in my college city over the summer and im the only one in my parents house the entire so like im just more resentful than i need to be maybe

rn im just already tired of having to be here the whole summer. and i just mainly wanted an apology or even admittance that she did a mistake throwing my food away w/o even TELLING let alone asking me until i found out after the fact

but also it’s her bday and now that ive ranted sm i feel bad abt making a big deal out of it so maybe i should apologize first? idk aita/what should i do next

CLARIFICATION:
- my dad is at his office rn but otherwise i would have talked to him as well, they were equally on board w throwing it out last night

- i wasn’t intending to argue w my mom when i asked her where it was, i was just genuinely asking bc maybe someone else ate it which i wouldnt have minded (as much), but when she said she threw it completely away i got upset bc that was a waste and she never told me

- the restaurant is 15 min away from my house and i came straight back home after bagging the leftovers

- my parents have never, not once, ever apologized when we get in an argument. the best they’ll do is sometimes a day later they’ll say sorry for making me feel upset, not for doing the actual thing that i got upset about (ex: my mom thinks i didnt do something and yells at me for it but when i tell her i did, she just leaves w/o a word) so knowing their track history and how they don’t take the blame for being in the wrong or even apologize it’s rlly frustrating. but because of this it is hard for me to apologize as well bc i’ve learned to be so defensive from them, so thats why im here ig to know who is wrong.

so far reddit is telling me im TA so i will definitely apologize first and try to communicate clearly w her why im so upset and like even if she starts raising her voice ima try to be calm abt it. but it’s not gonna be rn bc im still just rlly salty abt my food being thrown away so i want more alone time rn before i face her.

At my wedding, I had my nieces as flower girls. 3yo was excited until it was time and then freaked out. Her mom carried her. Tia later commented that it ruined it.

62,1cyy0io,AITA for not checking on my friend? ,"So for the past several months I’ve been staying with a friend and it’s basically gone pretty great, as well as could be expected. Just for background we’ve been friends for over 20 years now and are like family. 

Today, I woke up around 5:30 in the morning and was just laying in bed listening to a podcast. I then heard what kind of sounded like a scream, but it was very quick and I was unsure of where it came from. So I paused my podcast, and listened for anymore sounds and nothing.

63,1cyxyf0,AITA for making my husband feel guilty?,"My (39f) husband (37m) works out of town every week and has for our son’s entire life. He leaves Sunday evening and returns Thursday at varying times depending on where he is and how late he is working. This Thursday is our son’s last day of Kindergarten. His school isn’t having a graduation ceremony or anything, but on the last day of school they have a big slideshow presentation for everyone and an ice cream social which our son is super excited about. I texted my husband on Tuesday asking him if he was going to make it to which he replied “when is it” and then “probably not but I’ll try.” I know sometimes it’s hard for him to leave early to get home for things, but it annoyed me that I had to bring it up. It’s a recurring argument that I feel I have to ask a ton of questions instead of him offering information specifically about scheduling. Anyway, fast forward to last night. My husband tells me on our nightly phone call he is going to stop on the way home Thursday (he drives and this week is 2.5 hrs away from home) in order to buy a truck. Context: he is starting his own business and has been searching for a good truck for a while. He found one near his worksite this week and had originally told me he was going to pick it up after work on Wednesday then drive it home on Thursday. So, I asked him what time he thought he would be home. He said a half hour later than he would if he wasn’t stopping, so (when pressed) 4:30/5. Then he changed the subject but I was hung up on this. I said “so wait, you would be home at like 4 otherwise? I thought you were getting the truck today?” The ice cream social is from 3:30-5:30. It seemed to me that he could leave work just a little early, but he was choosing not to. Even if he didn’t leave work a little early he could’ve made part of the ice cream social. As I am working this out out loud he starts getting really defensive. This is where I might be the asshole. I said “you get the same emails I do- I shouldn’t have had to even ask you if you were going to make it. And it seems like you have more wiggle room in your schedule than you led on.” I had assumed when he said he couldn’t make it it was because they were working late, but it was a matter of 30 min. He then says “I get a million emails every day, but thanks for making me feel like shit.” At this point I’m really annoyed and say I’m going to go. We don’t communicate at all until this afternoon (this is also abnormal as we always text goodnight and good morning) when he texts me today at noon and says he is in fact going to make the ice cream social. I’m happy for our son that he’ll be there, but I feel annoyed that I had to have this argument with him before he prioritized it and that I had to even bring it up to him to begin with. So, AITA for making him feel guilty? 

Edited to add: 
My husband is not leading a double life and he’s not cheating. Geesh. 

He is trying to start his own business so he can be home more. It was mutually agreed upon and I temporarily gave up my work on Fridays so that he can pursue this on his days off. He’s tired, I’m tired. We’re all tired. 

I still work part time from home but I am a SAHP. I honestly don’t think this is relevant and some of the women/SAHP bashing comments on here are wild! Also, we have another child- a 1.5 year old we recently adopted. Anyone who has had a toddler or adopted can vouch that this is a lot even if you’re not working.

65,1cyxekj,WIBTA if I go on a trip my mom disproves of?,"Throwaway just in case. 

I (26f) live with my mom (55f) and brother (30m). I have chronic illnesses, OCD, and autism (late diagnosis, my mom does not know this one). I work a full time job, I pay rent (even though our house is paid off) and utilities, as well as my own phone, car insurance, and groceries of my own.

I cannot drive very far simply because one of those illnesses causes me a leg tremor. So I don't go out much to not put my mom out having to drive me, and there's not much reliable transit in my city. 

I am planning on a 2 day 1 night trip to a city two hours away to visit my friend for a concert. There is a shuttle from my city to there that I'm plannin to pay round trip, I have the ride situation in the city figured out because they do have transit, and I'm staying with my friend. I have had these plans for a month, and it is in about 3 weeks from now.

My mom told me she's not comfortable with me going because I'm not super independent - but that she wouldn't stop me. I figured I am an adult and I don't know how else to be more independent besides just doing it.

However, now she is telling me that I'm ungrateful and just doing this to hurt her? She is doing a lot of petty things like using the water to water grass while I'm showering (our water can't handle both, she always waits til I'm out usually), offering to wash my water bottle for me (I do it usually) and she uses an old unclean rag, and started smoking again saying it's because I stressed her out too much (she was clean for 5 months).

I told her to act like her age and she said I'm being a bitch. I may have gone too far with that comment and may the AH, and I might just be one in general for doing something I know hurts her.

67,1cyx6j0,AITA for going to a club after my boyfriend birthday ,"     I’m 19 he’s 26 we’ve been together for over a year now. For context, his birthday is Saturday, May 25th we originally planned on going out Friday (bowling and dinner) and I spend the night at his place. 
     My friend called me couple days ago and asked if I can go to a gay club with her and a couple other people on Sunday and spend the night because the show we going to see at the club starts late. I never been to a club yet and thought it would be fun. In the moment I didn’t think it would get in the way of our plans. 
     But the problem is that my father doesn’t know about my boyfriend and I usually have to make an excuse or lie where I am at whenever I spend the night at his place. I usually say I’m with my friend, since I only have one friend I can’t say I’m going to spend the night twice. I can’t really control how my father is so I tried to compromise with my boyfriend. 
     I asked if we could still celebrate on Friday but I just don’t sleepover which I think is a pretty valid solution since I don’t have to say I’m at a friends house or anything to my dad. He didn’t like that solution, he just wanted to fully do it another week. I eventually was fine with it after I thought about it more, but initially I kinda felt like I *was* canceling on him even though it was his idea to do it another week. 
      So the day passes, he then tells me he isn’t gonna spend his birthday alone after all because his friend is coming to visit him. He hasn’t even met this friend in person yet, they met online and he’s younger than me. So I feel like he’s just trying to play with my emotions since I couldn’t celebrate his birthday with him.

69,1cywvvr,AITA for putting a Case Worker in a rough spot,"Here's the deal. I (20F) have a genetic disorder called Mosaic Turner's. I work as a Case Aide for a DCFS affiliated company. I work part-time, as I'm a college student, but since it's summer, I've been covering a lot of visits and transportations as needed. Maybe about a week ago I was asked to cover a transportation on May 28th. I said I would cover it and forgot to put it in my calendar. 
On Tuesday, I got a phone call reminder that I have an appointment with an endocrinologist. I haven't been to an endo in almost a decade, but I'm having a lot more health issues come up so I booked this appointment a couple months ago to see if there 's treatment or if it's even Turner's related. My appointment is at the same time this transport is. But, as I said, I didn't put the transport in my books. 
Today (Thursday) the Case Worker messaged me about the transport and I realized we had a problem. I told my manager and she said to put it in our group chat and see if someone can cover it. A coworker said she could and I thought all was well. That is until the same coworker said that she read the time wrong and she's actually in a visit at that time. 
Now we're still stuck in a pinch and no one else has responded in the chat about covering this transport. 
I feel really bad for saying I could do it and backing out only a few business days beforehand, but I'm about to find out if I'm infertile and if I have hormonal problems still.

I work as a Case Aide for a DCFS affiliated company. I work part-time, as I'm a college student, but since it's summer, I've been covering a lot of visits and transportations as needed. Maybe about a week ago I was asked to cover a transportation on May 28th. I said I would cover it and forgot to put it in my calendar. 
On Tuesday, I got a phone call reminder that I have an appointment with an endocrinologist. I haven't been to an endo in almost a decade, but I'm having a lot more health issues come up so I booked this appointment a couple months ago to see if there 's treatment or if it's even Turner's related. My appointment is at the same time this transport is. But, as I said, I didn't put the transport in my books. 
Today (Thursday) the Case Worker messaged me about the transport and I realized we had a problem. I told my manager and she said to put it in our group chat and see if someone can cover it. A coworker said she could and I thought all was well. That is until the same coworker said that she read the time wrong and she's actually in a visit at that time. 
Now we're still stuck in a pinch and no one else has responded in the chat about covering this transport. 
I feel really bad for saying I could do it and backing out only a few business days beforehand, but I'm about to find out if I'm infertile and if I have hormonal problems still. I need to go to this appointment and the Endo is SUPER booked, which is why I forgot about the appointment in the first place.

Context: My gf and I have lived together for 3yrs and split most of the expenses 50/50. Recently, we moved across country and I sold my car. Because I WFH 100% now it didn't make sense for us to have two cars and the new apartment complex we moved into charges $75/month for a second car. We agreed to share the car. What we didn't agree on from the onset was how all the expenses were going to be shared, which really is the crux of the issue, but I digress.

I told her for me to drive the car that I would need to be added to her insurance, which I would pay for, no problem. I also said I would be more than happy to split gas, maintenance, and other similar type costs, with the exception of contributing to the car payment. That's when she got upset and me for not wanting to do that. Rationale being that I really won't use the car much without her being with me or doing something for our apartment (Costco run or something similar). And she had the car before me, so it's not like I was able to contribute to the down payment, select the car make/model, financing, loan term, etc.. I said the only exception where I would contribute to the car payment was if I would get money back based on the % I contributed to the car when we go to sell. She declined that idea.

The end goal is to eventually sell her car as well and purchase and SUV to better handle the weather where we now live. In this scenario, I have no problem splitting the car payment since it will be a joint decision.

77,1cytuo6,AITA for asking flatmate to stay out of my room?,"My flatmate and I get along 90% of the time, however, whenever there is a slight disagreement, the vibes get awkward and moody.

My flatmate often leaves stuff lying around in the living room - on the couch, tv stand, table, everywhere. I often put these things in a pile when she’s not around so I can relax peacefully, however, I never enter her bedroom… I pile them somewhere in the living room for her to deal with later. If we are both home and the living room’s a mess, I often move things around to make space (rather than interrupting her relaxation by nagging and asking her to move her stuff) but she often gets moody and says something like ‘are you serious.’ The living room is our main space so I like to keep it tidy and put my things away before bed (except the washing that’s drying).

As we live in a small flat, in a cold country, one corner of our living room’s dedicated to hanging washing to dry. Yesterday when I got home, my washing and mail had been put in my bedroom. I told her ‘thank you for putting the stuff in my room but in future can you please leave it in the living room for me to deal with when I’m home?’

She got defensive and said she only done it because my washing had fallen down. I think this is false because she had cleaned the living room (which she rarely does) and also moved my mail. Ironically, her mail and crochet stuff are still on the couch!

I suspect she had her new boyfriend round, which isn’t a problem. If I knew this, I’d have put the stuff away in advance. I understand she might have made plans when I was out, however, I wish she asked permission to enter my room. I probably would have said yes but feel it’s disrespectful to do so without permission as I could have had a diary or personal letters on my desk. My room was also in that private messy way that you don’t want others to see.

After explaining I was weird about her going in my room (EDIT: also discussed this early on and have lived together around 8 months now), she got defensive and argumentative, then left in a huff.

79,1cytkds,AITA for not showing up for my senior year baccalaureate ceremony?,"I (23M) am reflecting a little bit on my senior year graduation week. Although today is my birthday, exactly five years ago, I believe that I lost a lot of respect in the small town that I grew up in because of an event that happened during graduation week of my senior year.

For some context, where I grew up, we did a baccalaureate service every year the day before graduation for the seniors. Although it wasn't mandatory, the seniors were encouraged to show up as a sign of respect for the community, as well as the speakers. Essentially, it is basically a ceremony in a church where a few speakers give some words of wisdom to the graduating class before they leave high school. In the ceremony, they have students that are involved in church activities and faith-oriented clubs take roles. I was one of those students, and I was on the worship team, playing guitar and being a lead singer for the club.

Although I did know that there would be a baccalaureate service, my 18th birthday fell on the same day as it, so in my mind, I already knew that I wanted to spend time with family rather than attend the service. Because of this, I did not attend the rehearsal the day before, and I was not asked about why I did not show up. However, as I was out with my family for my birthday dinner, I get a call from one of the faculty members at the school, who also happened to be my youth pastor. I proceeded to get questioned as to why I was not there, and that I was ""expected"" to be there, as I was supposed to give the invocation prayer that would happen before the service took place.

In that moment, I decided to tell my youth pastor that I was not going to be there, as I was out with my family, celebrating my birthday with the people who were the most important to me. He then proceeded to tell me that I could have just celebrated the following night, and just celebrate my graduation and birthday at the same time, telling me that it wasn't ""that important"" for me to miss the baccalaureate. After I heard those words, I hung up the phone in frustration. My family saw my reaction to the phone call, and did nothing but support my decision, saying that he was in the wrong for downplaying such a big day for me. Needless to say, it did leave a sour taste in my mouth from my own youth pastor telling me this.

The following morning, I went to school for graduation rehearsals. As I went down to the field, I began to feel a number of people look at me with disapproving stare. Needless to say, in a small town, word travels fast when you have done something to piss off the community. Most of my class began to question me as to where I was, saying the exact same thing that my youth pastor did, saying that my birthday was ""not that important.""

Although I did know that there would be a baccalaureate service, my 18th birthday fell on the same day as it, so in my mind, I already knew that I wanted to spend time with family rather than attend the service. Because of this, I did not attend the rehearsal the day before, and I was not asked about why I did not show up. However, as I was out with my family for my birthday dinner, I get a call from one of the faculty members at the school, who also happened to be my youth pastor. I proceeded to get questioned as to why I was not there, and that I was ""expected"" to be there, as I was supposed to give the invocation prayer that would happen before the service took place.

In that moment, I decided to tell my youth pastor that I was not going to be there, as I was out with my family, celebrating my birthday with the people who were the most important to me. He then proceeded to tell me that I could have just celebrated the following night, and just celebrate my graduation and birthday at the same time, telling me that it wasn't ""that important"" for me to miss the baccalaureate. After I heard those words, I hung up the phone in frustration. My family saw my reaction to the phone call, and did nothing but support my decision, saying that he was in the wrong for downplaying such a big day for me. Needless to say, it did leave a sour taste in my mouth from my own youth pastor telling me this.

The following morning, I went to school for graduation rehearsals. As I went down to the field, I began to feel a number of people look at me with disapproving stare. Needless to say, in a small town, word travels fast when you have done something to piss off the community. Most of my class began to question me as to where I was, saying the exact same thing that my youth pastor did, saying that my birthday was ""not that important.""

80,1cyt6l6,"AITA for ""mom shaming"" my (20M) sister (28F)?","
My (20M) sister (28F) has a 5 year old. His dad is not in the picture. She’s currently temporarily living with us.

My nephew is the most entitled little brat you will ever meet. Super picky eater, constantly jumping around, messy, moody, oversensitive , throwing tantrums all because my sister enables him. Before she moved in with us, I used to feel sad for her, but now I think this is honestly my sister's fault.

For example he keeps bringing in dirty rocks and instead of telling him not to, my sister washes them for him and lets him keep them or when he cries over a toy, she always gives in and buys him whatever he wants. He won't sleep without his toys and has the worst sleep schedule. He will wake up in the middle of the night wanting to play or because he ""just remembered something"". She enables this behavior by listening to what he has to say. He’s touch-sensitive, sound-sensitive, light-sensitive , senstive-ANYTHING and my sister does absolutely nothing to get him used to it. 

She also refuses to discipline him in any way. I told her to tell him to eat or go to bed hungry and eventually he will get hungry and eat, but she refused, saying she won’t starve her kid. I told her to stop picking up his toys after him and not give him toys until he learns, she said she won’t punish him like that.

He still occasionally wets himself and my sister took him to a pediatrcian for that but they found nothing wrong and reccommended to a child psychiatrist, so he got evaluated and DIDN'T get diagnosed with anything but my sister refuses to believe that this is the result of her poor parenting and goes doctor shopping to get him diagnosed.

Now, since she moved in with us, my mom has been helping her. When she told us how she’s so anxious about moving back because she will be all alone again and she loves my nephew and wouldn’t change him for the world but sometimes he can be so hard to handle, I said that’s on you, though. She asked me what I meant, and I told her my nephew is hard to handle because she lacks discipline and keeps enabling him. Her gentle parenting clearly doesn’t do her any favors. She doesn’t get to complain because she paved this way by refusing to listen to our offers.

My sister broke down and started crying because there is already too much on her plate, he doesn’t get the help he needs, she does the best she can, and she didn’t need me mom-shaming her. I apologized but told her there is nothing wrong with him, HE ALREADY SAW A PROFESSIONAL , the only “help” he needs is some discipline.

81,1cyt2fe,"AITA For arguing with my mother and not just ""accept the truth""?","So for context in May last year I (20nb) ran away from my family's home in a small town and went to a big city. I went NC with my mother+father and LC with my grandmother. After some time though my dad left my mother and is working through divorcing her and is putting in effort to actually support me and be parent, but this isn't about him. This is about my mother. Anyways I have been going to therapy, and my therapy worker suggested I go from NC to LC with my mother and try to reconnect.

And so I did however I did barely respond to her. 

Though last night was the first conversation I've had with her for around a year. 

It started off small, basic chatter about why she was stalking my social media accounts and why she would even want to see my content as it's actually me being myself. I thought it was going to end there and boy was I wrong. She proceeded to rant at me the usual speel of ""You'll be who your born as"" and ""I know you better because I birthed you"" and ""I am your mother and nothing will change that and I know the truth of who you are"". She barely actually knows and supports me because when I tried to reach out to her she would just yell at me for ""not seeking the truth"" and ""living in stupid dreams"" rather than being what she wanted. 

After a bit I told her goodnight and she continued to yell at me but this time it was on voice clips. One second she's yelling, than suddenly crying, than suddenly apathetic. This went on for 2 hours With her telling me I'm selfish, I'm emotionally blackmailing her, I'm asking her to do something she will never do, and that I am going against her beliefs and that I'm delusional and selfish. eventually she asked if we should go to therapy together. I told her if she wants to find someone to do so that I'll consider it. 

I'm not sure if she's right, if I should go to therapy with her, or if I'm in the right here for telling her ""I'm my own person and just because she birthed me doesn't give her a right to dictate who I am"" which is what made her start yelling at me in the first place.


UPDATE: NTA seems to be what everyone is saying

I spoke to my therapist (or well my new one) and told her everything that happened and what you all said.

I'm currently dating someone outside my race, and while that shouldn't be an issue, it's caused major friction with my family. To add context, my boyfriend and I are from the same country, even went to the same high school before migrating and starting to date. 

I'm living in my uncle's house, but he doesn't reside here. My immediate family—my mother, step-father, and brothers—live in the basement, while I share the upstairs with my cousin and grandma. My relationship with my mom has always been strained; she has a certain vision for my life that clashes with my own desires for independence and autonomy.

Things came to a head when my uncle found out about my boyfriend. My grandma wanted to meet who i saw dating so I asked my bf to come over to meet her. I believed she told my uncle and he did not take the news well. my uncle texted me demanding I move out, calling me ungrateful for not conforming to his wishes after he found out. Despite my attempts to talk things out, he was adamant. Now, my uncle wants to sell the house because I didn't end things with my boyfriend like he had hoped.

My mother found out after my uncle told my brothers they had to find a place as he is selling the house. My mother is blaming me and berating me and my bf. For context I don’t pay any expenses beside half of a utility bill and grocery sometimes whereas my parents and brother pay rent. I'm torn—I want to move out and live my own life, but I'm scared of leaving my younger brothers behind. We're close, and the thought of not being there for them is terrifying.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting to move out and potentially leaving my family, especially my younger brothers, behind? Am I being selfish for wanting to pursue my own happiness and independence?

83,1cysfz0,AITA for telling a close friend she can't stay with me anymore?,"I (22F) moved to a new city from my small hometown for work. Since this move, my lifestyle, habits, schedule etc have all changed as I am navigating being an adult and a working professional.  I've also been actively trying make new friends, and distance myself from certain friends who I feel I have nothing much in common with anymore from my hometown. 

So a week ago, a friend, let's call her Riya, who I've known since we were 11 said she wanted to come stay with me for a few days as she was ""so bored"" in my hometown and all her friends had left somewhere for summer. Riya is still in uni and comes from a privileged family where she doesn't really do any chores and all her bills are paid. We used to have alot of sleepovers when we were kids where our respective mothers used to cook for us. 

For some context, over the last couple of years, I really do not feel a connect with her, as our interests, hobbies and opinions became drastically different. I also feel the only reason we remained friends is because we haven't really had a fallout or a fight. 

So for the last 4 days, she's been staying with me and I can't stand her company. I feel like this is reflecting in the way I act with her, and I regret saying yes to her staying over. She kept complaining about how I order takeout alot, how the mattress is too firm etc. I snapped when she complained about us taking public transport was such a hassle as she has a chaffaeur at home.  I told  her we're adults now, and I cannot baby you for all 5 days that you're here. 

Riys got extremely upset and brought up the fact how welcoming her family have always been to me, which is true. I just wish she'd understand I don't have a mum or a cook at home with me and her staying over now as an adult is different to us having sleepovers as kids. She said I wasn't being a good friend or host. 

So, AITA in this situation? Should I have been a better host and friend?

84,1cyruhk,AITA for wanting more time with my husband on our anniversary ,"We had our anniversary yesterday, he (34) picked me up (f30) from work and we went to a cool restaurant for happy hour. He game me a little card he made (every year I ask him for a card instead of presents) and we were there for 2 hours. Since he was paying for dinner I’ve asked him what kind of present he wanted, he told me he wanted this new shoes but his size wasn’t available so I told him I would get it when his size is available. 

Anyway the problem was, after dinner we went home and he mentioned he wanted to play video games with his friends, I thought he was joking so I said something like “wait, is your friends your wife?” he commented something and we laughed, so I thought he understood that he wasn’t playing video games today because it is our anniversary and I wanted to have the second part of the celebration, meaning get in bed.

I asked him to drop me in the close store because I had to buy some paper towels and I told him he could go home (the store is very close to home, so I felt like it he didn’t have to wait for me). After 10-15 minutes I get home, he is showered and he is playing video games with his friends! I was pissed off immediately! I didn’t say anything because he was live so everyone could hear me on the mic, and tbh I was just upset. 

I decided to take a shower and I usually take a shower right before bed, so we came to the bathroom to pee and asked me why I was taking a shower so early. I said “what else am I supposed to do?”, the tone of my voice wasn’t right. So he asked me if I was mad, so I replied “what do you think?”. So he proceeded to play video games with his friends!!!!!!

I went to bed and haven’t spoken to him since, this happened yesterday.

Am I overreacting? Should I have communicated my expectations better? Isn’t obviously that your anniversary day should be spent with your loved one? Am I being ungrateful?

a little bit of context: I (22f) until a few months ago lived with my sister (28f) and her husband (31m). in january i had an errand to run after work that would take less than 10 minutes (driving time included). as i was getting in my car my sister stopped me and said BIL had to go to the same place so we should just go together. i really insisted that i’ll just go alone and i didn’t want to ride with him but after a lot of convincing eventually caved. BIL said he was putting pants on and we would leave in a minute. i had worked a 10 hour shift starting at 4am that day so i was really tired and just wanted to get this done and go to sleep. so after waiting half an hour and him still not being ready i just left by myself and went to bed. i wasn’t mad about it, just tired, so i just forgot about the whole incident.

 after that i had started to notice BIL blatantly ignoring me or making mean comments about me.  so after about a month i asked him if i had done something and was willing to apologize cause i didn’t want to have conflict. he said no but he continued to ignore me and be rude.

 in march i was really struggling financially and my sister told me she was gonna let me not pay rent that month cause she new i was broke but that BIL said not to help me cause he was pissed at me and wanted to make sure i “struggled in life” and i didn’t deserve help from them. she said he was still mad about what happened in january and is pissed that i never apologized. i asked why he didn’t say anything when i asked him and he said he shouldn’t have to tell me how i disrespected him, i should just remember. So i just apologized to him for not remembering and i didn’t mean to disrespect him.  he still ignores me and makes rude comments so i  am protecting my peace and making sure to stay low contact with BIL. 

i’ve got my own apartment now so i dont have to live with him anymore. a few days ago my sister invited me to go do an escape room her and some family this friday and i immediately said yes. after i found out BIL is coming too i told her that since he is going id rather stay home and that we should go another time without him as a girls night. sister said she thought i was joking in march when i said i didn’t want to speak to BIL again. now my sister and Mom are saying im a bitch and i should just get over it and that im having a dramatic reaction to an insignificant comment.

 in march i was really struggling financially and my sister told me she was gonna let me not pay rent that month cause she new i was broke but that BIL said not to help me cause he was pissed at me and wanted to make sure i “struggled in life” and i didn’t deserve help from them. she said he was still mad about what happened in january and is pissed that i never apologized. i asked why he didn’t say anything when i asked him and he said he shouldn’t have to tell me how i disrespected him, i should just remember. So i just apologized to him for not remembering and i didn’t mean to disrespect him.  he still ignores me and makes rude comments so i  am protecting my peace and making sure to stay low contact with BIL. 

i’ve got my own apartment now so i dont have to live with him anymore. a few days ago my sister invited me to go do an escape room her and some family this friday and i immediately said yes. after i found out BIL is coming too i told her that since he is going id rather stay home and that we should go another time without him as a girls night. sister said she thought i was joking in march when i said i didn’t want to speak to BIL again. now my sister and Mom are saying im a bitch and i should just get over it and that im having a dramatic reaction to an insignificant comment.

should i get over it and still go or stick to my gut and stay home? AITA? ",0.0,0.011373265646398,0,1
87,1cyqrov,AITA for setting a boundary with a friend?,"I (17F) had recently gotten into an argument with a close friend (17F).

I met my friend (B) last year around november. she is one of the closest people in my life and i thought she understood me the most.
My only “problem” with her is how often she calls, its always without a warning. I’ve told her since since start of our friendship that i don’t like calls, sometimes im fine with calling if im able to and have something to talk about. i can barely keep up a conversation irl if i dont have a topic to talk about. Even then she keeps on calling me and would even beg, and 2/3 of the calls she makes is just because she “misses” me. I’ve started getting mad getting called twice a day just because she “misses” me and whenever i try to end the call she would beg me not to and that we could stay on a silent call, whats the point of calling then?
Because i cherish her as a close friend i never say anything directly about these unwarned calls because i don’t want her to get annoyed or start to overthink what i said. I’ve also become very busy this week due to personal things which she knows.

Now onto what happened.
Yesterday i had a physics class and right before it she called me, i closed the call and told her “i can’t call i have a class, please stop calling me all the time i don’t have the time to answer anymore”. She said that she called by mistake and sent 2 voice messages that I couldn’t hear. I, again, told her i was in a class and that i can’t hear the voice messages, she replied with “i’m not begging you to listen to them, when you get back from class listen to them” which got me incredibly mad.
After the class i listened to the voice messages and its basically her saying she called by mistake and that i didn’t need to “explode in her face” because she called me. 
I told her that i said that because she calls me everyday for the reasons i listed and told her  “how is it wrong of me to ask you to stop calling me without warning” and mentioned how i kept my mouth shut for her and how she was supposed to know that i don’t like calling in general.
She replied saying “oh so you’re doing me a favor by keeping your mouth shut? whenever you say you want to close the call i close it immediately and its not like anyone is forcing you to call” 
she then sent “you’re making it seem like im forcing you to be my friend”. I dont know why she would say that. She then says “i know you got friends but its not ok to say some out of pocket things like that, i get that im too much and im sorry” i can’t tell if she’s trying to guilt me or something?? there was no need for those texts.
She then goes on to say “sorry if i ever made you feel uncomfortable or put you in a awkward position or not made you laugh, im trying my best here too” which also had question marks going off in my head.

I genuinely don’t know what i should do because cherish her as a friend, she’s almost like family. And i never did anything to get her to the point of saying the last few texts she sent. AITA?

Aloha, I’m writing this on mobile so I apologize for any errors.

Anyways, I(17F) and my college roommate(18F) have been roommates for almost an entire semester. I love her and her family for all that they’ve done for me, but I have problems with her in particular, and I don’t know if it’s worth the nuclear option(Switching to different roommate).

My roommate calls me by a nickname, which would be fine if it wasn’t for the fact that it’s the same nickname my grandfather calls me. It makes me feel uncomfortable-especially with the drama going on with him(she know about that as well) I brought it up with her multiple time, however she took as “something happened that made me upset” and not a boundary I don’t want her to cross.

Another issue is her touching me or my stuff when I clearly state that I don’t want her to(the touching is in no way inappropriate just stuff like poking me while distracting me/tickling) it annoying because I always flinch and she never gets the hint that maybe she shouldn’t do that. She’ll also sometimes force hugs on me, though recently that’s stopped.

I would tell her honestly how I feel, but she has a history of depression and I’m afraid my tendency to get angry and defensive when people piss me off(unfortunately something I picked up from my home life) and I don’t want her to do anything to herself

Would I be an asshole if I threatened her with moving out if she didn’t stop crossing my boundaries? Me and one of our friends tried talking about boundaries to her, and it seems she either: can’t understand what we mean or is actively ignoring us.

I’ve worked hard for so many years and am the kind who saves ahead for her future and family. Since my partner is younger than me, it is not fair to compare since we are at different stages in our careers. But that being said, I have financially supported him multiple times in the past while he was studying or is between ships. He is in the merchant navy so he works for 6 months and is on a break for 6 months (unpaid). He is a great guy but doesn’t make financially responsible choices. He always wants expensive gadgets and latest phones. He wanted some fancy car monitor/audio setup and I used the money I had saved for my wedding dress to help him out. He recently purchased an extravagant car and will now have to pay off a heavy loan. He also needs to do a course which will cost him €2000 next year. I had saved up for our wedding and he has no savings. As a partner I feel like I should help him out financially for his studies because I love him and want him to grow, but at the same time I am annoyed that he bought such a unnecessarily fancy car, without considering me or our future or the strain it will put on me financially. I can understand that was his decision, his money. But now I can’t fully fund his studies and our wedding and our house, that’s unrealistic. I expect the shared resources to be split between partners, I am not his sugar mommmy. I was very clear that I will not contribute to the car, since he didn’t include me in the decision making so it is his car, not ours. I also wanted to take a break and study someday but I know he will not be able to support me but is it unfair to expect him to after I supported him for so many years. TBH if after 9 years he hasn’t proposed, I doubt he ever will. So I’m also concerned that 5 years down the line, he decides he doesn’t want to get married, then it’s all my money gone down the drain. I sense a bit of resentment as well that he’s dragging me along just for the sake of it without any intention of actually marrying me.

A few hours ago Eve called me, saying Sam refused to eat the vegetables she made. When she told him he had to eat his greens, Sam said he wanted my spinach bacon soup or no veggies.

Eve then called to ask me for my recipe. That soup, however, was one I created the recipe with Paul and I don’t want to share. I told Eve I would make the soup and drop them at her place the day after tomorrow. I told her Sam is good with fruit, so if he doesn’t eat the vegetables he can have extra servings of fruit in the meantime.

Eve said I was being ridiculous and selfish. And dropping the soup two days later mean Sam won’t get to eat vegetables till then. I just don’t want to share our recipe which may be used commercially later. AITA?",0.0,0.004685902968049,0,1
94,1cypgtu,AITA to tell my dad not to visit every second day? I am a 42 yo grown up Asian female and not disabled.,"I’m an Asian female, 42, living alone after a divorce, and dealing with ADHD, depression, and anxiety (well-managed with medication and counseling). I work part-time as a health professional and study veterinary science full-time, which is hectic and stressful. My parents separated years ago, and my father still treats me like a child, which is really frustrating.

He visits almost daily, using his house key, despite me asking for space over 50 times. After long days at work or uni, I need to recharge alone as an introvert, but he doesn’t understand. He insists on cooking for me, but his dishes are often unappetizing (like mixing baked beans with black bean beef or Chinese BBQ pork with spaghetti Bolognese). I feel guilty for not appreciating his efforts, but I really need my own space.

My dad is in his 70s, retired, and lonely, with no friends or social activities. I’ve tried encouraging him to meet people or learn new skills, but he remains reclusive. Exams are approaching, and I need to focus, but his visits and expectations add to my stress. He’s moody and easily offended, making me anxious about spending time with him.

I’m capable and don’t need his help, but he doesn’t see that. His way of showing love is by bringing food and doing chores like taking out my bins, which makes me feel inadequate. On good days, I tolerate it; on bad days, it’s overwhelming. He doesn’t listen or respect my boundaries, despite me communicating clearly.

I feel guilty for not wanting his frequent visits and cooking, but his presence and comments about my weight (I have a BMI of 30) add to my stress.

95,1cypc8e,AITA for having an album with pictures of a YouTuber on my phone who looks like my boyfriend?,"Hi! So this is a situation in my life that's been going on for a while and I'm unsure on how to go about it: 

I (20F) have been dating boyfriend (21M) for a little over a year, we've been doing great overall and even moved in together recently. We are big on trust and transparency which is why we've had each others phone passcodes since the beginning, he goes into my phone to play games alnost every day, I don't go into his phone because I don't feel the need to but I'm glad I could if I wanted to. This has usually never been a big deal until recently when I started noticing that he stopped just playing games on my phone and started sifting through my apps, especially my photos (looking for what, I don't know, I don't think I've ever given him a reason to doubt my loyalty). He slowly started questioning me about photos in my camera roll which I found annoying in the beginning but haven't paid to much mind to until he came across a folder containing pictures of a YouTuber. 

I won't say who but he is British and prominently, though not exclusively, known as part of a popular Duo active since 2009. That should narrow it down.

My boyfriend had a huge issue with this and I understand how it might come across weird but hear me out: I've been following these people's content for ten years, I have had accounts on multiple platforms dedicated to them. I've been farming this content for years lol, fans will know what I'm talking about. One thing he pointed out that I did not realize before is that boyfriend looks like this guy. I thought he was crazy at first but I have to be honest, he's right. Boyfriend is now convinced that I am madly in love with this man and am only dating bf because I pretend he's him. That is not true, they are nothing alike beyond looks. Can I confidently say that subconsiously it might be the reason I started pursuing him though? No, we all have a type. I feel like this is driving him insane, I can't even watch their videos anymore when he's in the same house because it ruins the rest of the day. I don't do that when he watches female streamer's compilations so I'm not really sure he's being fair. 

I could just delete the album and move on but to be honest: I don't really feel like it.

96,1cyp9qj,AITA for Calling Out Another Judge During a School Music Competition?,"  
Hey everyone,

  
(Names changed for privacy)

  
I’m Georgie, a music teacher at a high school, and recently I served as a judge for our school's annual music competition. Alongside me were Mrs. Johnson, a fellow music teacher, and Mrs. Smith, an older history teacher who doesn't have much knowledge about music. (Her singing is terrible and is never on beat, and while this shouldn't be too much of a factor, seeing other fellow teachers too, they are normally fine.)

  
Throughout the competition, Mrs. Smith kept making comments that were objectively incorrect. She claimed one performer was off-key and unclear when they were perfectly on pitch and articulate. Mrs. Johnson privately agreed with me that the performance was flawless but only gave generic feedback publicly.  


  
On the other side of things, Mrs. Smith also praised a performance that was clearly pitchy and flawed, describing it as perfect. While I understand that music can be subjective, I feel like it just showed her clear bias towards certain genres. (Which is fair, but I try my best to be an impartial judge, so it's frustrating.)  


  
I tried to politely disagree with Mrs. Smith’s comments during the first few performances, hoping she would reconsider her approach. I would say things like, ""That part was actually a key change"" or ""That's typical for this genre,"" trying to explain without being confrontational.  


  
By the middle of the show, I was fed up with her inaccurate and misleading comments. I felt like, at some points, they were even just exaggerated and not encouraging.  


  
During one of the transitions, within the judging table and the audience around, I snapped and said something to her like, ""It's clear you don't know what you're talking about. Your comments are misleading and unhelpful to the contestants."" It's not the exact words, but I know my comment was blunt and probably quite rude.  


  
Now, I’m wondering if I went too far. I felt that her feedback was unfair to the performers and potentially damaging, but maybe I should have worded it differently. I'm not sure how else I could have gotten my point across. She did become nicer, but it did become awkward.  


  
So, AITA for calling out another judge’s lack of musical knowledge and biased feedback in such a blunt manner?

98,1cyouhr,AITA for not attending my friends birthday drinks? ,"I (22 F) and my partner (22 M) was invited to my friends (22F) birthday drinks in another city which I said I would attend. 
At the time I was also dog sitting, usually I’d be able to leave the dogs alone for hours without concern but this time one of the dogs is suffering with a few health conditions so shouldn’t be left alone for longer than about 4-5 hours max. Baring in mind the drive there is an hour and a half and the drive back would be even longer due to an event going on in my city.
My original plan was to ask my partners brother to look after the dogs whilst we we went so they wouldn’t be alone as he’d met them before however a couple of weeks before he went to Australia and decided he was going to extend his trip rather than come back as planned so I tried to make other arrangements such as getting my dad to look after them. I kept my friend in the loop the whole time and had even brought everything to attend (it was a themed event) My dad wasn’t sure for a while as he had something to attend and he let me know the day before he couldn’t. I didn’t tell my friend on the day I found out due to it being her actual birthday, she was busy and I didn’t want to ruin her day
My friend text me on the day saying “I’m guessing you can’t come” I let her know and told her I’d make it up to her as I’m off work for the majority of June so it would be easier to plan something. Since that day she’s been so distant and blunt baring in mind we use to chat loads about everything and anything and now we can barely have a conversation in one day. If it was closer I wouldn’t have had any problems with leaving the dogs but the drive being 3+ hours alone it just wouldn’t have been justifiable. I don’t drive and wouldn’t have been able to afford another transport up to her so it isn’t like I could’ve gone up and my partner looked after the dogs. 
I’d rather her tell me she’s upset, we discuss it and sort it out rather than this distant hardly talking. 

I believe I’m TA for letting her know so late but it was a situation where I tried everything I could and kept her updated throughout. But don’t think i’m TA for the reasons why I couldn’t. 

EXTRA INFO - It wasn’t just me and my partner attending there was a bunch of other people she’d told me that were attending & I’d agreed to dog sit in December so it wasn’t a last minute thing.

101,1cynrlw,AITAH if I (35F) stick to my boundary and don’t invite my cousin (42F) to my wedding after cousin goes on apology tour after finding out she is not invited?,"My cousin, Amy, has been toxic to me from the time my parents separated when I was 5 and she was 12 (when my mom stopped coming to family events on my dad’s side). Amy would tell me that I am worthless, unlovable, that I am undeserving of my family or love, that no one wants me around, and worse. Adults in my family observed some ofthis behavior but failed to step in (my family is notoriously non-confrontational and lacks backbone). This resulted in consequences to my psychological development and ability to form healthy relationships. 

Her behavior continued until I was in my early 30s. My last straw was witnessing her break my sister’s (16 at the time) heart when Amy uninvited my sister, Claire, and brother, Tim, from her wedding because my father only invited friends and his first cousins to his sixtieth birthday party. The only people from my generation there were my sister, brother, and me. Amy told my father “you didn’t invite me to your sixtieth birthday so I uninvited your kids from my wedding.” For whatever reason my dad, stepmom, and I still went to the wedding- stepmom and I ended up bawling in the bathroom. 

Amy has a sister, Ella, who is 10 years younger than I am. Ella and I became closer around four years ago, and I learned that Amy has been toxic to Ella as well, which caused me guilt because I felt that if I had stood up for myself, maybe Amy would have been held accountable and not have continued her toxic behavior with Ella. 

Ella told me that Amy has always made me out to be public enemy number one and that’s why she never tried to get to know me before four years ago. 

My dad told his brother that Amy would not be invited to my wedding when save the dates went out last month. Since, Amy has reached out to me, my dad, my stepmother, and my sister to try to get an invite. In each case she made herself out to be the aggrieved party- telling me that she always thought that I hated her. Her explanations hold no credibility with me, as what 12/13 year old thinks a 5 year old hates them. 

I agreed to have coffee with Amy, but plan to tell her that I have no desire to try to fix our relationship, as I had tried that 7-8 years ago and her behavior did not change, despite her telling me she wanted a better relationship. AITAH if I tell her she won’t be getting an invite to my wedding because being in her presence causes me anxiety and stress and I neither want nor need stress or anxiety on my wedding day?

TL;DR: cousin has been toxic to me for thirty years. AITAH if I stick to the boundary I created and don’t invite her to my wedding, despite her request to move forward (after she found out she is not invited)?

Edit: thank you so much to everyone who has commented! I greatly appreciate it. I have hired security for our wedding. Before save the dates went out, I pulled pictures from Amy’s, Amy’s husband’s, and Amy’s mother’s social media accounts and gave pictures of all of them to my wedding planner to pass along to security. I did this in the event they blocked me once they found out Amy is not invited to our wedding and I lost access to photos of them. Security will call the police and they will be arrested for trespass if they show up. 

I know everyone is saying not to have coffee with Amy, but I think it would be a positive step for me to meet her and tell her to her face how she’s impacted my life and tell her that my decision not to invite her to our wedding is final and that I have no desire to keep her in my life going forward. Thank you to those that suggested either recording our meeting or bringing family and friends along. I had already asked my fiance to come with me and be close by, but I do live in a one party consent state (though it doesn’t matter if we meet in a public coffee shop). I will record our meeting just so there is an accurate account of what happens. I will not hesitate to share it with my family members if she spreads falsehoods about our conversation. 

I really appreciate everyone’s comments and support. I will update after our meeting, which should be in a couple of weeks. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-23,"AITAH if I (35F) stick to my boundary and don’t invite my cousin (42F) to my wedding after cousin goes on apology tour after finding out she is not invited? My cousin, Amy, has been toxic to me from the time my parents separated when I was 5 and she was 12 (when my mom stopped coming to family events on my dad’s side). Amy would tell me that I am worthless, unlovable, that I am undeserving of my family or love, that no one wants me around, and worse. Adults in my family observed some ofthis behavior but failed to step in (my family is notoriously non-confrontational and lacks backbone). This resulted in consequences to my psychological development and ability to form healthy relationships. 

Her behavior continued until I was in my early 30s. My last straw was witnessing her break my sister’s (16 at the time) heart when Amy uninvited my sister, Claire, and brother, Tim, from her wedding because my father only invited friends and his first cousins to his sixtieth birthday party.

102,1cynpah,AITA for needing my space to study and telling my dad not to come around every frigging or second day? I feel like such a bad daughter (I am 42 yo Asian),"Hi guys, this is my first time posting. Please be gentle with me lol. 

This issue has been bothering me for ages. Just a bit of background about me. I am an Asian female and 42 yo, I live by myself and divorced a few years ago and suffered mental illnesses (well under controlled with medications/counselling - ADHD, depression and anxiety). I am working part time as a health professional and currently studying full time veterinary science so really very hectic and stressful lifestyle. My Asian parents had separated many years ago and my father still treats me like a kid which really annoys me. 

He likes to come visit (he has my house keys) every day or every second day. It has always annoys me and I have told him no less than 50+ times that I need my space especially after working 10+ hours some days at the pharmacy standing on my feet or at Uni. The very last thing I wanna do is to 'socialise'. To be fair, sometimes I would rather just stare into space and recharge being an introvert. 

Also there is always this expectation that I have to like his cooking (which quite often I don't as he really is a very terrible cook). For example he will prepare food like adding a can of tomato sauce baked beans to a dish of black bean beef. Or adding some Chinese BBQ pork in a plate of Spaghetti Bolognese. Basically like mixing an all you can eat buffet into one very weird dish.  I feel like I am a terrible daughter for not being appreciative and wanting my space and time to do my own things. 

Heck....most people my age might even bring guys home regularly and I never do as I am too focused with my work/studies. I just can't imagine what it would be like if I did that. It would be so uncomfortable for myself and the fellow.

He is in his 70s, retired and lived by himself and probably lonely too. He doesn't have friends and doesn't go out to socialise and meet people at all. I know it sounds harsh but there's not much I can do that he's a recluse and I tried for many years to encourage him to learn some new skills or meet people after he retired (10 years ago).

Exams are approaching and I really need to concentrate and keep my head down to study. I suffer from ADHD so any slight noise/distraction (including my cats meowing and dogs barking) really disruptive. Besides, my dad's extremely moody, sensitive and easily offended. I often feel pressure spending time with him worried that I will tick him off. During times when I have less patience (like now or exhausted), I just wanna roll into a ball and hide or die. 

In fact I had done it so many times but he just doesn't get the message. I had openly spoken to him about my feelings and he would just get offended making me feel I am a terrible daughter not appreciating his help to look after me. 

To be very honest, I am 42 yo and very capable and not disabled. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE DOES WHAT HE DOES??

I don't need him to look after me AT ALL? If it's anything, he really just adds on to my stress (depression and anxiety). Am I an arsehole for wanting space and not wanting my dad frequently show up unannounced and bring food or insist to cook for me? He never really talks to me or ask me how am I going. His way of expressing love/affections is to bring food and make me eat.  

Like he will even drive 20 minutes to my place one day to just collect my bins or take the bins out. It just makes me feel so inadequate and I fucking hate it whenever I am stress. On a good day, I tolerate it...I never like it...but on a bad day, I will just feel so irritated. I feel not listened to, not respected as I had communicated loud and clear to him for more than 50+ times. 

Sorry for the long post and I am ready for everyone to say what an unappreciative and ungrateful daughter I am. I feel like I am forced to eat his food and when I refused to eat his cooking, he gets upset. He is also controlling like typical Asian parents and love giving unsolicited advice. I am overweight with BMI 30 and he often openly tells me to lose weight and to exercise and I would like to do that if I had more time. I just don't need someone (parents) to frequently tell me I am a fat fuck basically.

I told him outright staying wasn't an option, as much as I'd love him to. I then gave him a copy of my calendar for the next few months.  

Anyway, I got a text from him late last night saying his flight lands tomorrow evening and wants to arrange something.  
My calendar has had this weekend blocked out since last year as it is one of the first big events of the year for my business, extremely profitable, needs both me and the other owner there all the time to ensure everything goes smoothly. We leave 5am tomorrow morning to start the setup for the weekend.

My friend was rather annoyed at this, but I said, I'm sorry it's in the calendar, you knew when I was available, I can't not be there.  
He suggested that I just let my business partner run it without me, I explained why that wasn't possible.

I'm apparently an AH for just trying to get him to come and work when he's back here on a break. That I viewed him as just another way to make more money and that work is more important to me, than being a friend, etc.

104,1cynlal,AITA for refusing to validate my wife's irrational fear?,"My wife and I have been together for over ten years, and when we're driving together and I'm behind the wheel, sometimes she will shout, ""Slow down!"" out of nowhere, and then say, ""Why are you driving so fast?"" in a critical tone, as if the way I'm driving is obviously unsafe. Usually I bite my tongue and slow down to placate her, but the thing is, the way I drive is not unsafe (driving since '97, never got a ticket or in an accident). 

My wife is generally a good driver, but much less experienced than me in snow and on gravel roads, and by her own admission she has some lingering driving-related trauma.

Yesterday she came home and told me that her car was making a rattling noise when she drove over bumps. We got into the car and I started driving down our driveway, which has plenty of bumps to hit (it's gravel and loooong), and I was driving slightly faster than usual to hit them hard to try to produce the sound she was talking about.

Suddenly, my wife yelled, ""Slow down! Why are you driving so fast?""

I glanced at the speedometer and laughed, didn't slow down, shook my head and said something like, ""Are you serious? What are you afraid of?""

Her response was, ""I'm afraid we'll skid out and go flying off a cliff!""

Since that was physically impossible - we were going 25 km/h (15.5 mph) and there was no cliff in sight (let me remind you we were on our DRIVEWAY - the same one we have been driving up and down for the past five years), I think I laughed and said words to the effect that she was being irrational. Predictably, she got mad at me for not ""validating her feelings,"" and I told her I wasn't going to validate her irrational fear.

She didn't ask me to let her out, so I kept driving and we survived the trip from the house to the road. Then we drove around for a while, listening to the car before going home, where my wife sulked for the rest of the evening.

We argue very rarely, but today the driving thing came up. Again, I refused to validate her irrational fear. We both got as worked up as we ever do - we're pretty calm people, but voices were raised. I told her how it annoys me when she yells at me to slow down, that it's insulting, that her fear is like being afraid of monsters under the bed, and that maybe she needs therapy to get over it.

She said I'm the one with the problem because I get annoyed when she yells at me in the car, and maybe I need therapy to work on ways to not be annoyed by it, and that I should simply do what she says in order to validate her feelings, ""the way you do for someone you love.""

Eventually we decided to end the discussion for the night because it wasn't going anywhere positive. She did her thing and I made a reddit account to ask this question: am I the asshole?

There's more to the story, but I hit the character limit, so I cut out a lot.

105,1cyniw1,AITA I can't cope with my husbands pedantic comments and mental health problems,"I am a married 36F to a 30M and have been for nearly three years. His mental health has been bad for seven years of our nine years together, with constant dips in to deep depression for ever changing reasons.  Whenever he is in a dark period, he becomes very pedantic about the smallest things and it is often a time when we argue the most. He has also had many long periods of sick leave from work because of this. I try to be very sympathetic to his mental health, and feel I try and let things slide to keep the peace and the situation stable for him. 

However, we have been here so many times now that I am really reaching my limit with what I can cope with. We argued last night over my making a risotto that I always make and have made the (as far as I understand it) the traditional way for years. He 'could not stand by as I wrongly commented on the amount of water and made an error' as it was like I was claiming 'blue was green'. Naturally I was frustrated with the comments and tried to call him out on why he was suddenly doubting the method I had used for years and did he really want a row over risotto. Now my reaction is the problem and I am the one who needs to apologies and make it up to him. This is how these conversations always end. 

Coincidentally, he was told to take time off work yesterday by his manager as his mental heath is too bad for him to work for the next week at least. I should say he is a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner, and claims he thought that feeling mentally debilitated to extreme levels for year for years while working to diagnosing people with the same conditionals was not problematic. I am doubtful whether this is a true statement or just blind denial. 

I feel like I want to leave, and have done many times in our short marriage, but I am also worried what he would do to him self, or threaten to do as he is all about blame and always in my direction which he never forgets about. He has openly said before he had written a note blaming me for any personal harm he caused himself which he would send to news papers documenting all the terrible things I have done that caused it. 

AITA? am I being too selfish in this situation when his is so troubled and just needs love, support and understanding? I should say when his mental health has improved he is not like this, he is back to the man I thought I married, it is when he slides back in to depressions and situations he struggles with in life that things become strained again.

107,1cyn3ge,AITA for not pleading with my stepdad to change his mind about walking me down the aisle?,"I (25f) asked my stepdad to walk me down the aisle and do a father/daughter dance with me at my wedding and he said yes. Now, I did this because I knew and was told enough times that he would love to do it and would be hurt if I didn't ask him because he's been my stepdad for 17 years. I didn't really want it to be him. But I knew it meant a lot to him and he has tried to be a second dad to me and he loves me, I know, and he has done a lot for me too. I just don't consider him my dad or even my primary father figure. That goes to my paternal uncle. But he's also a great husband to my mom and dad to my half brothers. So I asked him despite him not being who I would prefer. And he was so happy.

This did not ask long. About a week after he said yes he asked me when I had decided to let him do it because I always implied heavily it would either be mom or my uncle. The question caught me off guard and I told him when I realized it meant so much to him. My answer upset him and he asked me what I meant by it meaning so much to him, didn't it mean something to me. I told him I was glad I could honor what he has done for me. But again that wasn't what he wanted to hear. He asked me did I ask him because I wanted him or because I felt like I had to. I asked him if that really mattered and he said yes. He told me he thought I had finally come around to accepting him as a second dad. Then he went on a rant about how for years he knew I never considered him a potential father of the bride and that I had put so many people before him for who could do the duties of a father of the bride. He said it always broke him when I got sad about dad not being able to do it because he liked to think I would see that I had an option that was just as special in him. But he said clearly I don't want him to do it and so he won't. He told me he wasn't going to walk me down the aisle or do a father/daughter dance with me if I didn't genuinely want him to, because he's not taking a pity ask.

A couple of weeks after this my mom told me how hurt my stepdad is and how he had expected me to plead with him to change his mind. We talked and she said she understood because my feelings had always been the same on him but she wanted me to know that she would say no if I ask her to do it now because it would destroy her husband.

It's been a couple more weeks since then and my stepdad approached me while we were at a family members house and he told me how angry and hurt he was that I had not asked him to reconsider. He thought I would have a real change of heart after hearing how hurt he was. I told him I couldn't change how I feel and given he didn't want to do it unless I truly wanted him to, I felt it was best not to beg or plead. He told me he deserved to be pleaded to after all the years he's been treating me like I'm his daughter.

108,1cyn0s2,AITA for charging my friend for her corsage and boutonniere? ,"My (17F) friends and I are planning to make corsages and boutonnieres for our senior prom this Friday. Since we’re meeting at my house, I offered to buy the flowers ahead of time so everything is set up before everyone gets there. 

We have 6 corsages and 6 boutonnieres (12 in total) to make. Here’s the thing: my friend Carly and I made all the corsages for homecoming, so we know from experience how much and long they take. The cost of flowers alone was \~$52 ($70 total for all supplies), and it took us 3 hours to make 4 corsages. With all of this in mind, I’m expecting the cost to be around the same and the whole process to take a few hours.

I also want to add that Carly and I didn't charge anyone for the corsages, and I paid for the supplies myself. This time, Carly, Eden, Vanessa, and I all agreed to split the cost of flowers as well as a pack of supplies that Vanessa bought ($15).

One of the sets is for Vanessa’s friend and her date. I asked Vanessa if her friend would be interested in joining us on Friday. My friends and I have never met this friend before, so I suggested this as a way to meet and bond before prom. Vanessa said most likely not. She is also leaving early to hang out with this friend, which means we’ll most likely have to finish her set. 

Carly told me tonight that her friend asked her to make them a set, and she charged them $20 total. I suggested that we do the same for everyone else and Carly agreed that with all of the time we’re putting in, it’s not fair to be doing this for free. 

I texted our group chat informing my friends that we would be charging $20 total. Vanessa responded saying that she’ll just keep the supplies that she bought. Initially I was confused and thought she was joking so I said “you’re funny” and told her to inform her friends. 

Vanessa texted Carly privately asking if we were really going to charge them and said that it was “steep” for us to ask for money. 

Assuming that flowers are around the same price as last time, the four of us would have all been paying \~$15 so Carly and I are only adding on a few dollars for our services. I figured that this was a fair price since the average cost is \~$20-30 for a corsage alone where we live. But after the way Vanessa reacted, I’m conflicted. 

Given how much time and effort goes into making these corsages and boutonnieres, I don’t feel comfortable making them for free, especially for people that I don’t know.

109,1cymxyc,AITA for asking my BF to contribute to the house despite not *really* living together?,"My (F30) boyfriend (M29) and I have been together for around a year. We started off as friends two years ago, and things escalated since. We bonded over some shared experiences, and by both having ADHD which felt familiar and understanding. Despite a rocky start, I think we reached a solid level of commitment.

We are both living in a country as foreign graduate students, and we came here with scholarships. Since we live only 5 minutes walk away from eachother, we met everyday for the past year. At some point, we spent two months in a row sleeping together at my house (which is bigger/more comfortable). Sometimes he stays for days in a row without returning home.

While I pay all my own bills and do the cleanings, he contributed by doing the dishes and throwing the trash, which I thought was fair. Also, my love language is acts of service, and since these are two chores I hate doing, I felt loved.

Recently, BF graduated and started an office job. I noticed since that he stopped doing those chores. I also noticed he started saving the receipts of everything he buys (for example breakfast) and charging me the exact amount. In the past, whenever we buy food to share with eachother, we basically ballparked the amount (I usually round down or tell him ""give me later"", but rarely charge him in the end). In addition, yesterday he said he would only pay for one third of the coffee pods since usually I have an afternoon coffee and he doesn't. In addition to being a bit more stingy with money (he said he is trying to save up) and not doing chores as proactively, I noticed that the last few times where I asked him if he could throw the trash he would complain and make annoyed faces.

You should know that despite not really living in my house, he still sleeps at my place almost every single day. That means he showers, leaves dirty laundry (which I wash/put away), creates trash, uses dishes, contributes (even though slightly) to the increase of the house's bills, has breakfast and sometimes dinner here, etc. Overall, I know is not a lot, but throwing the trash a couple of times a week is also not a lot.

Last night was recyclables trash day. My plastics and cans were overflowing, so this morning I realized and asked him about it, he said he remembered the trash but he didn't want to throw it because it was late. I told him he should have at least told me and I could have thrown it instead, but he shrugged it off, which started a fight.

In conclusion, basically he just told me (sarcastically) he ""didn't realize how much of weight he is to me"", and that he is going to stay at his place more often and come to my place ""only when necessary"", and downplayed a lot the things I do around the house like for example the laundry. He also got annoyed at the fact that I ruined his day off for bringing this up, and that he hates when I complain about stuff. This really upset me because I feel he is being unfair, and also I'm worried about this attitude switch.

I'm a nanny in a very rich house with full time cleaning staff. They wash dishes for everyone except the boy I nanny for (basically his Mom and Dad).

The job is quite stressful, I need to manage teachers and coaches, interview, hire, and manage them (watch their lessons, advice them, make sure they don't give him chocolate). I need to constantly switch between 3 languages and do a lot of communications not in English, but also teach the kid language, as well as reading/writing/piano, and assist in his trainings.

In the mornings, I have to do a 20 minute workout with him before school, cook his breakfast, do uniform, tooth brushing etc... and this is much more difficult with a billionaire celebrity kid from another culture than your own kid. I need to be creative with my motivations and techniques; I also need to work on his psychological/mental health, character, emotions etc... and it's more difficult for me to be creative/insightful when I'm tired and stressed (I'm usually tired because I put him to bed, then stay until I'm certain he's asleep, then often he'll come to me in the middle of the night if he can't sleep, plus I need to wake up early to get ready).

We basically have 40 minutes to get ready (20 after workout), and often I don't have time to wash the dishes after breakfast. The house keeper always scolds me over this. If I had time I'd be more than happy to wash them, but at the same time, it feels like it shouldn't be my job.

111,1cymr2p,AITA for telling my baby’s father that our son is cuter than his little sister?,"Before you judge, hear me out. My baby’s father is constantly fat shaming my mother and whole family. The majority of my family have conflict with him but I still don’t think it’s appropriate for him to be calling my family fat, ugly and “pigged body” especially because he’s overweight himself. I have also faught with his parents but never physically insulted them like he does to my family. 

The reason I’m making this post is because yesterday via text he mentioned how gorgeous our baby boy is. He then added that he’s way cuter than my cousin’s daughter who I’m close with. She is 4 years old and I thought that was extremely inappropriate. There was literally no reason to bring her up in the conversation. I don’t know if he does this to bother me or if he’s that comfortable sharing his stupid thoughts with me. 

Today when he picked me up to go shopping I found the opportunity to give him a taste of his own medicine. We were talking about putting our son in modeling and that’s when I said “honestly my baby is the cutest baby I’ve ever seen. Cuter than celebrity babies and your little sister”. He was
totally caught off guard and said “omg poor Jade” I forgot what else he said but i think it was somewhere along the lines of that not being so nice.  He then continued with he’s cuter than your cousins daughter, what do you think? I said they were about the same, eventually answering his question that my baby is cuter but my cousins daughter Layla was still very pretty. I told him that if he can bring up Layla I can bring up his sister Jade. He then tried to justify himself saying that because my cousin is a bitch. In my head I was like “so we’re gonna bully her daughter because you don’t like my cousin???”. He also brought up that Jade is darker than Layla so it’s worse to slander her (so stupid). I said that’s BS and there’s was a long awkward pause. He then opened his mouth to say “poor Jade”. I continued and said no offense but my child doesn’t compare to her when she was a baby. 

So obviously I did it to prove a point although I didn’t tell him “now do you know how that feels?” He’s such an ass that it wouldn’t have made it effective if I would’ve told him that I didn’t mean it. Although I’ve had bad experiences with his parents and little sister, I am pretty much friendly with them and the whole family. I don’t have problems with his other siblings while he has problems with the majority of my family. So I’m guessing that because of this it’s okay to insult my family but it’s not okay to insult his. I want to add that his little sister is 10 and he said he was going to tell her. He said it in a joking manner but he doesn’t have too much common sense and tells his family everything so I’m sure he will mention it to his parents, older sisters and even Jade, his little sister. I know this will create tensions with his family and I feel sour even having to say my son is cuter than Jade when she was a baby but I’ve had enough of him picking on my family especially a four year old little girl. I’ve told him many times to stop calling my mother fat and he just won’t stop, so now I will have to use his little sister to hurt him and hopefully get through to him.

I told him I accept his apology but do not want contact with him, also because, to be honest, we are just two different people with (totally) different interests. Then this year, a few months ago, he wrote me another email saying the same basically and I chose to not reply, my parents and coach also said that’s the right choice actually. I was bullied so much by him and his other friend at that time (who is now 16, M). This all happened in March of 2022, when I was 14, he was 15 and the other friend was also 14 like me. It was my first year of HS and already had to be homeschooled because of bullying (also because of the years prior). I am now homeschooled and enjoy it, to be honest. He has bullied me since elementary school and saying he’s sorry every time, his actions don’t show it.

My (17M) former “friend” (17M) whom I went to school with (both elementary, middle and the first year of high school) had apologized to me last year for bullying me in school. He still had my email and wrote me an email saying he apologizes for what he had done and he wanted to be my friend again. I told him I accept his apology but do not want contact with him, also because, to be honest, we are just two different people with (totally) different interests. Then this year, a few months ago, he wrote me another email saying the same basically and I chose to not reply, my parents and coach also said that’s the right choice actually. I was bullied so much by him and his other friend at that time (who is now 16, M). This all happened in March of 2022, when I was 14, he was 15 and the other friend was also 14 like me. It was my first year of HS and already had to be homeschooled because of bullying (also because of the years prior). I am now homeschooled and enjoy it, to be honest. He has bullied me since elementary school and saying he’s sorry every time, his actions don’t show it. He also sent my real friends threats and insulted their families for no reason, calling them all kinds of bad names. They made me look like a fool in front of the entire class.

113,1cymitv,AITA for not making food for my dad's stepkids?,"I (16m) make my own lunch for school. I started making them when I was 11 and my mom was sick with cancer and now I make all my lunches. My dad refuses to give me lunch money for school, said no way in hell to making them (mom made his and now he pays for lunch every day) and doesn't want to give me permission to eat outside school (which is an option with parents consent) because he'd need pay for that. So I make them. I work part time and so I started paying for the ingredients I use in my lunches.

My dad got married 2ish years ago. His wife has three kids who are 5, 7 and 8 now.

For about a year there's been this issue where my dad and his wife want me to make all four lunches. They said if I'm making my own I should make my ""siblings"" (and I say ""siblings"" because they're not my sibling) lunches too to save their mom time and to streamline everything. I was like no and my dad's wife was shocked. She called me out for making stuff only for myself. She said it's crazy that I would look at my ""siblings"" and not want to make a few things for them too.

It escalated to where they said I shouldn't get to eat their dinners if I won't participate in taking care of the family. So I buy my own dinner stuff now and make my own. Now they're calling me out for doing that. They said I could make dinner for all four of us and then we could eat dinner earlier and my dad and his wife could do something else.

My dad's wife didn't make lunches for her kids on several occasions to try and make me relent. Their teachers ended up feeding them and writing to her about it. She was super pissed and asked me if I was ashamed. I told her they're her kids and her problem, not mine. I also suggested she take it up with my dad if she's unhappy and wants help feeding her kids because it's not my job. She said if dad won't feed me, he won't feed her kids. I shrugged her off.

Monday was a big day in all of this. I was home for hours alone and made a nice dinner. I was eating when my dad's wife came home with her kids, who were hungry and she exploded on me and asked if I'd made the kids dinner. I said no. She demanded to make it up to them I make them lunch for Tuesday (yesterday) and I said no. She called me a bunch of names and told me she fucking hates me because I'm supposed to be a decent kid and yet I won't help feed her kids and it's not how you treat family. I told her because it's not my job and we're not a family. I pointed out she married a guy who isn't a good dad to his own kid, and how her only interactions with said kid were attempting to dump responsibility onto him (me) so she really has no reason to think I owe her anything. Which of course let her to calling me all kinds of things, including an ass.

Due to some issues in my childhood I started taking them in high school at 18 and used them on and off. I don’t like using them because I think it’s embarrassing I need them as a grown man so I try to not take them they. However since about Christmas of last year things were getting really bad and although I tried to stay off them I started having negative thoughts and isolating myself so I decided to go back on them before I did somthing I regret. 

I’ve been dating my gf since 18 maybe a few months after I originally started going on meds and have never told her about these issues or anyone really. When I was isolating I would just make excuses about being busy with school and work because I didn’t want her to know how bad it was. Some medications also ruined my sex drive and that combined with those same childhood issues made me embarrassed/uncomfortable with sex. 

However she went through my phone the other day and saw some of my journal entries about how I’m feeling and my medications. She got upset that after almost 5 years together I’ve never told her about my depression or anxiety and that all the times I was distant it was actually due to mental health reasons. I told her it’s hard to bring up and I just didn’t want anyone to know or judge me for needing medication to cope with my daily life. AITA for not disclosing this stuff with her?

115,1cym9ac,WIBTA if I choose to no longer speak to my ex-lover? ,"I (17f) had recently broke off from a short term relationship with my former lover (18m), (I'll just call him X for the sake of this post and his anonymity). X and I ended the relationship on neutral terms, agreeing to remain cordial/friendly since we were in the same friend group and didn't want to make things awkward. We've had a talk a couple weeks back,ande we've both agreed to move past that time. 

The relationship gave me insight into my own romantic orientation and I realized that it's hard for me to actually feel any romantic interest. I've gone into the relationship with significantly less experience (it was my first relationship, it was X's fourth), yet it seemed like I accepted the breakup faster than he did. Don't get me wrong, it stung and I know that it takes a different amount of time for each person to heal from this sort of thing, but when we had that clear-up talk I thought we were both over it. 

Fast forward to the following month and it's our graduation preparation (yes I'm about to graduate in two weeks), and we receive our honor ranks. Now I'm in no way the smartest one of the bunch, not by a long shot. However, I did get a good rank, I'd say upper 20th percentile (doesn't seem important but please trust me it was important to HIM), and of course I was celebrating because one, I'm an idiot so this was a huge achievement for me and two, hey I'm going out of the school with a bang, of course I'm happy. So I'm celebrating with the other people in my friend group, we're all happy that we've gotten the school year over with. 

Being the detail-oriented doofus I am, I saw that X was kinda tense, so I cut my celebration short to check up on him. At this point I DO NOT HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM ANYMORE, he just has a history of emotional breakdowns and I was rather worried. His rank isn't as high, and apparently that was what he was sulking about. 

Unrelated- but does anyone even know what to do in this scenario? I didn't, so I just sat there like an idiot and let him vent. Yeah it was all about his self esteem and how he thought he worked enough to propel himself up to roughly my rank, all that. Yeah sure it was justified, until he said something that kinda ticked me off. 

""You celebrating your rank was annoying, but IT'S FINE. ""

Excuse me? Mind you I wasn't screaming, I was beaming like a doofus and I WASN'T EVEN IN HIS LINE OF SIGHT. My other friends were giving me quick congratulations and the occasional slap on the back or hug. Everyone else in the same rank as me was celebrating the same way, if not louder. 

Okay sure, he was upset. I let that slide for the time being. He finished up his rant and we end up walking to the same area so he could walk home and I could take public transport back to my place. That's when he asks to talk again. Oh, what does he want? 

Romantic affection. The dude wanted one last romantic gesture. We've been broken up for almost a month already by this point, and we've established that we already moved on. I mentioned above that I realized something about my romantic orientation. Yeah, I'm probably somewhere in the asexual category. Touch is fine, but something like that OUTSIDE of a relationship?? Nuh-uh from me. 

I just bolt and say bye to him as I jump up onto the first public transport I saw. He apologized roughly half an hour later, I brushed it off and we haven't spoken since. 

I do not want to be ANYWHERE near him. But we still have our graduation so I'll suck it up for a bit. But after that, WIBTA to just stop talking to him?

116,1cym36g,AITA for telling my older sister her obsession with our mom's age is weird?,"I (17m) have two sisters. My older sister is Mackenzie (32f) and my younger sister is Indie (15f). So all three of us have the same biological parents and this is important because when it comes to the weird age fixation Mackenzie only focuses on mom. So our parents were basically my age when Mackenzie was born and in their 30s when they had me and then Indie. Mackenzie has always, and I mean always, fixated on how glad she was mom was only 18 years older than her and how she couldn't imagine her being older because they'd be less close. Mackenzie internalized this mindset so much that she had her kids when Indie and I were still really young and she refuses to have more because she thinks she'd be an old mom now and believes Indie and I had an old mom. She always makes comments about how weird that mom and Indie are so close because she couldn't do it at that age gap and stuff. She never mentions this about dad. Like ever.

Indie and I roll our eyes when it comes up and our parents told Mackenzie on occasion that she shouldn't think like that. Mom said she'd still love and connect with her but she'd have more tools to be a better parent if she'd been older. I think it probably freaked them out when Mackenzie had two kids before 20 to be a really young mom like our mom was to her.

My parents went out of town recently and they us stay with Mackenzie while they were gone. One of the days we were with her Mackenzie started talking about mom's age again and I told her I find her obsession with that so weird. I told her Indie and I have no problem being close to mom or to dad because they had us in their 30s and can she please shut up about it because 17 years of listening to that gets SO old. Mackenzie said I shouldn't be so rude and I don't know what I'm missing out on.

I actually have her soft blocked and unfollowed on social media because she even makes these comments on posts about the age of parents. It's so annoying.

117,1cyltn4,WIBTA if I tell my sister to stop saying my kids are hers? ,"Long story short, I’m divorced and have shared custody of my 2 kids. I was sick for a few years and in that time, my ex had the kids during the week and they’d spend the weekends and one weekday evening a week with me. For about a year, they’d also spend about one weekend a month at my sister’s house. They were preteens and the same age as her son, so she really didn’t parent them, the three kids just spent the weekend hanging out. It wasn’t that I couldn’t care for them, either, I just thought they’d have more fun with their cousin. If they couldn’t go over for some reason it wasn’t a big deal, I didn’t *need* her to take care of them. 

Now she won’t stop telling people she thinks of them as her children because she “stepped in” when I wasn’t there for them and it’s really bothering me. My parents say she doesn’t mean any harm and she’s just saying it because she “loves them like they’re her own” but I think it’s really inappropriate. It’s not like I lost custody of them or was estranged from them. They don’t view her as their mother. I feel like she’s exaggerating both her involvement and my illness to make herself out to be a saviour when all she did was normal aunt stuff. 

I want to ask her to stop but I know she’ll be extremely offended and say I’m ungrateful for all she’s done for me. I don’t think she did anything out of the ordinary. I took care of her son a LOT when he was a toddler and actually needed to be babysat and I don’t try to say he’s my kid. My parents think it’s not a big deal and I should just let her think that but I think it’s insulting to me.

To sum it up the trip didn’t really go great for me.
 One thing about me is i really don’t like physical affection from others. I have a boyfriend and from him I’m completely comfortable with it but from others it makes me feel very claustrophobic and uncomfortable. My best friend on the other hand is very very affectionate, she loves cuddling, holding hands, hugs, basically any form of affection she loves. Throughout the trip she would ask for some of these forms of affection ooooor she would just do them and I let her because I didn’t want her to feel bad but sometimes it would be a lot so I’d ask her to give me a little space. This went okay a few times but if I didn’t imitate any affection or let her too many times she would get really sad and upset with me.

During this time fiancé was telling me to just let her hug me cause that’s all she wanted so I stopped fighting. Me saying no made her go still and completely shift away from me and she started crying while sitting on the edge of the couch.

Just trying to make it better I layed my head on her lap but she shifted onto the floor away from me and started crying more which made me panic more and worse than before she ended up just comforting me which I let her to despite it making me uncomfortable and we went to bed after talking for a bit and watching so random show.

119,1cykz91,AITA for wanting step daughter out of master bed?,"So 29(M) here. Me and my 36 year old baby mother live together. We’ve gotten back together about 5 months ago. (Long story but happy as can be). Prior to our break we were together for 6 years. 

She also has a 15 year old daughter. Keep in mind I love her daughter as if she was my own. Unfortunately her father hasn’t seen her in about 14 1/2 years due to other reasons #deadbeat. 

So upon moving in, my son(4 years old) sleeps with her, and her daughter (15 years old gonna be 16 soon) sleeps with her at night in the bed as well. 

So moving in wasn’t necessarily planned, it just happened and I don’t regret it. It’s a 2 bedroom 2 bath at her apartment. Step Daughter has her own room, queen size bed everything, and master bedroom has baby mommas and mine stuff, bed etc. 

Only issue is, my bed is the couch. Since I moved in, we split rent, utilities, everything 50/50. Normally I’d sleep with her in the bed with my son (never a problem) just cause my son doesn’t have a room
Yet. But as for her daughter? Seems a little unfair to me. I love them all, but allowing your 15 year old daughter to sleep with a furry animal, and sleep in the bed, when your partner is on the couch, doesn’t sit right with me. 

This whole daughter sleeping in the bed has just recently happened before me moving in. But I have great trouble wrapping my head around the mentality of “WTF am I doing here”.

I feel like I’m couching surfing. I didn’t renew my nice apartment loft in downtown due to us discussing ways we can be together more, how I can help her out more taking the kids to school in the am, pick them up ( I work full time) and plus side is I see them more. Which I love. 

But we’re partners, dating, together. I’ve mentioned respectfully that my back hurts from the couch but her response is “I can’t tell my daughter to not sleep In the bed with me , I feel she will feel left out. “

Wrapping my head around this sucks. I feel disrespected and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong. But again, I cover 50% of any bill in the apartment with her and still, couch surfing it, am I in the wrong? Or Is she? Should she put her foot down and realize her daughter isn’t 5 years old anymore? Is it separation anxiety from the daughter? or should I just accept I’m on the couch and hoping one day the daughter matures enough to stop sleeping with her mom in the bed and I get my bed back with my partner? 

Mentioning my frustration to my partner would usually result in us probably having an argument. Which I don’t want but I don’t know what else to feel, or think. 

Thanks.

120,1cykute,AITA for canceling my baby shower that my Mom planned,"
I'm (31F) 30 wks pregnant with my 1st baby. My Mom (58F) volunteered to plan my baby shower which I thought was great since my relationship with my family has been strained for awhile. 

I told her all that I would like such as theme, decorations, guest list, food etc. I knew she never planned big events like this so I told her to get in call my fiancé's mom (54F) since she has experience planning big events & to get the guest list from her for my fiancé's side of the family because my fiancé (36M) doesn't have all the contact info for them.

She told me she would & weeks pass. I come to find out that she never called her & my fiancé's mom took the initiative to call her & offered help. My Mom declined & didn't get the guest list. She told my fiancé's mom that she could make food. I had to also take the initiative to keep calling my Mom weekly to offer help since she wasn't updating me to let me know what was happening with my baby shower. She always declined my help & never offered any info on what's going on with my baby shower. 

My fiancé's mom called my fiancé yesterday to let him know that my Mom never called her back on what to make for the baby shower or got a guest list from her. I was so confused since I was under the impression that they've been in contact more than once. 

I called my Mom & asked her why she didn't call her back to tell her what to make & didn't get her guest list. She got defensive towards me & tried to blame me for her not doing any of it. She only invited my fiancé's mom & sister. Nobody else on his side of the family. I hung up on her once she said, ""Would anyone even come or you trying to make me feel shitty?""

My Dad (60M) called me & yelled at me over this situation & he got hung up on since I'm not getting yelled at 30 weeks pregnant. We had a back & forth through text after the call until my Dad told me that he's taking my Mom to urgent care.

About 20 mins pass & my Dad calls me back. He argues with me & throws up funding my college in my face even though I've been financially independent for nearly 10 yrs. They always make me feel bad about getting me material things that I never asked for yet never listen to what I really need which is for them to just listen & be there for me.

The boiling point is when my Mom flat out lies in front of my Dad since both are on the call claiming that my fiancé's mom never called her. That was it for me. I told them to cancel the baby shower this weekend & that I'm done. She blatantly lied to save her own ass & tried to blame someone else instead of apologizing & taking any accountability. She disrespected my fiancé's family & didn't even invite any of them besides mom & sister even though there's family in the area. 

I haven't heard from them since yesterday & just feel heartbroken and so stressed out. On top of it, my estranged sister (27F) sent me horrible evil vile texts that included my unborn child. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-23,"AITA for canceling my baby shower that my Mom planned

121,1cykpuh,WIBTA for no longer giving somebody rides that lives 15 mins from my apartment,"Okay I'm going to keep this short. 
I (20) have a husband (22) that has been searching for a job for over a year and a half with his degree. 

To make ends meet, we had been working fast food jobs at different hours because we only have one car. This car is not new, it has 206k miles and I feel I'm going to need a new one soon. 


Anyways he had tried to apply to numerous jobs but since the job market is ass he went out of our living area and applied to a place an hour and a half away. 
They accepted him.
So for a minute he was driving 1.5 hours to work and back every day. 

Well, this local company offered to help him move closer because they really needed somebody to fit the role - only one role for this field was in said company. (Software development) until it gets bigger.

His boss shows up with two men and they help us load stuff into a uHaul and unload when they got back. 
I'm in my third trimester so I couldn't help much (such as move a dresser) so I'm thankful they helped us out. 

Keep in mind they were PAID to help us on company time. 
Well, we move in. 
It's been a month. 

My husband informs me he has been bringing one of the men to and from work because he hasn't gotten a car and can't drive. 
I ask why. 
He replies he was charged with a DUI and lost his license but he says he got his license back. 
I say great so he can drive himself?
Husband says no he lost his car
I ask him what else this guy has done
Apparently he's a druggy that has been in and out of jail and is in his 40s.
I feel uncomfortable with this.

The other issue is - besides his record - his job role is completely different from my husband's. 
My husband has a set clock in and out time, this guy doesn't. 
So my husband revealed to me why he has been late quite a few times coming home.. this guy takes about an extra hour to finish his work. 
I said this isn't fair at all for you (husband) and you shouldn't be giving him rides any longer
Now I have a doctor appointment for the baby where I used to live. 

I'll return just in time when he gets off work. 
I'm going to be hella tired as I always am - the baby is due soon. 

WIBTA for leaving this guy there at work and only picking up my husband?? 
WIBTA if I had my husband stop picking this guy up?

I told him starting next week not to give him any more rides. Which could result in him losing the job, but then again why is this MY fault?? Why did he apply for a job he can't commute to? He IS a new hire.

My sister is somewhat of a hopeless romantic and she's been trying to set me up with a mutual friend of ours. We'll call jer Jade here.

Jade is very beautiful, but I see her as just a friend.

My sister claims that a crush is just a friend you're sexually attracted to and tried to convince me to go on a date with Jade. I, on another hand see a clear distinction. There is people that are your friends, friends that you're attracted to, people you're attracted to and finally, people you have romantic feelings for.

Btw I'm not saying I view my friends sexually or think of them like that, but I can see some of them are very attractive and if we weren't friends I would probably sleep with them if circumstances were right.

My sister set up the date anyway, behind my back. We made plans for lunch but when I showed up instead of her, there was Jade. I politely explained she's a beautiful woman but that I see her only as a friend, and drove her home.

On Sundays we normally meal prep for the week, mostly lunch for Monday - Thursday. This is both to be healthy but also to save money, as buying lunch out is expensive. And in saying we, I mean me, because I do all of the cooking maybe except a smoothie now and then. This Sunday I had to work, so i only did a tiny bit of food prep in the morning, and I didn’t make enough for all the lunches. I also worked late night so asked him to roast some veggies we could have with some quinoa (I had to cook this because he didn’t know how to) and now when I’m sitting here looking at my lunch I feel so tired of not being able to give away some of the control in the kitchen. 

He roasted some carrots that’s clearly not peeled, some tofu and CUCUMBERS. This is mixed with quinoa and zero spice, oil or flavour of any kind. He asked me how I was and I told him the truth: it tasted like nothing and cucumbers shouldn’t be roasted, and now he is pissed.

He keeps saying he likes to cook, and I would like nothing more for him to cook me dinner after I’ve had a long day working a double shift, but I also feel like every time he tries it tastes horrible and I 1) can’t finish 2) feel sick (some undercooked rice in the past) 3) feel like a horrible person for not liking his cooking.

I love cooking and I’m happy to do it 90% of the time, but am I being an asshole for being fed up with an grown ass adult man not being able to cook basic things so it actually taste nice?   

Even when I’m sick he don’t have the skillset to cook me basic food unless it’s pot noodles and a box soup. I understand not everyone can be great in the kitchen, but currently I’m seeing my future as the one person who does all the cooking and I’m not sure how I feel about this.

125,1cyjm8b,AITA for deciding to not live with my parents over a petty argument?,"I (24F) come from a land where it is common (recommended, if anything) for adults to live with their parents all their lives. My parents and I lived together in a metropolitan city and recently I got a new job at a remote area just outside the city, so I moved out 6 months ago. My workplace is pretty great and the job role is also positively challenging with good exposure. Initially I could go visit my parents twice a month.

My mom (59F) had a hip replacement surgery due to an accident right after I moved out and it has been challenging for my parents to manage by themselves while adjusting to a life without their children around (I have an older sister who got married 5 years ago).

Although my job is fulfilling, I work 60 hour weeks and lately all our weekly offs are being substituted for in the future as a result of seasonal high product demand (I work in a management role at a manufacturing plant). This has made it impossible for me to look after my parents directly, and that became a problem since my parents started hiding new medical conditions from me and my sibling because they don't want to have us worried.

On the other hand I am engaged to my boyfriend (25M) of 3 years. We have plans of getting married next year and get settled abroad where he works - which gives me only a year to live with my parents before I get married and move away. All of these these are the reasons for wanting to live with my parents till I get married. In fact I have an interview lined up with a big firm in the city this week.

Being a close knit family in a culture that requires adults to look after their aged parents in all aspects of life, it is ideal of me to get actively involved in things that other moved-out-children wouldn't usually be required to pay attention to (for example, a wiring issue), and I voluntarily do. I have previously chosen to go out of my way to help my parents out with similar issues.

The other day, they had some plumbing issue. My solution was to call a plumber up immediately, but my mom suggested to text and wait. While it wasn't an emergency, the sooner it would've gotten fixed the better (it was a small leak and plumbers here are not paid well or aren't even remotely motivated to take jobs). While arguing about it, my mother snapped and told me to stay out of it and let her handle the situation her way. I know this sounds petty but for context, this has happened before and my mother always says the most ungrateful stuff when she snaps. She has said some pretty hurtful things before on multiple occasions.

I got really sick of being called names for actually acting in the best interest of my family and I said I am going to cancel the interview because I changed my mind and didn't want to move back in. She got pretty upset and now my father is saying I acted like a b\*tch.

On the other hand I am engaged to my boyfriend (25M) of 3 years. We have plans of getting married next year and get settled abroad where he works - which gives me only a year to live with my parents before I get married and move away. All of these these are the reasons for wanting to live with my parents till I get married. In fact I have an interview lined up with a big firm in the city this week.

Being a close knit family in a culture that requires adults to look after their aged parents in all aspects of life, it is ideal of me to get actively involved in things that other moved-out-children wouldn't usually be required to pay attention to (for example, a wiring issue), and I voluntarily do. I have previously chosen to go out of my way to help my parents out with similar issues.

The other day, they had some plumbing issue. My solution was to call a plumber up immediately, but my mom suggested to text and wait. While it wasn't an emergency, the sooner it would've gotten fixed the better (it was a small leak and plumbers here are not paid well or aren't even remotely motivated to take jobs). While arguing about it, my mother snapped and told me to stay out of it and let her handle the situation her way. I know this sounds petty but for context, this has happened before and my mother always says the most ungrateful stuff when she snaps. She has said some pretty hurtful things before on multiple occasions.

I got really sick of being called names for actually acting in the best interest of my family and I said I am going to cancel the interview because I changed my mind and didn't want to move back in. She got pretty upset and now my father is saying I acted like a b\*tch.

126,1cyjlfm,AITA for asking my neighbor to move the fence he built on my yard?,"I have lived at my house for 5 years with no problems with my next door neighbor until now. 

He put in a fence along our side yards this winter with no survey and since there was snow on the ground, you could not see the sprinkler heads. A few weeks ago, I went to turn on my sprinklers and it turns out the new fence is on my property as my sprinklers heads are on the other side of the fence now. I normally wouldn’t care about this part of my yard, but I plan on selling my house this year and in order to sell things have to be up to code. 

I asked my neighbor if he could move the fence over (it’s a chain link which makes it easy to move), and I told him that I plan to sell. He stated it was all good because he already hired someone to come and move my sprinkler heads over so then it wouldn’t matter.  

I told him no to moving the sprinkler heads as when a survey is done for the sale of the house, the fence is still on my property and will need to be moved, and then the sprinkler heads won’t be in the right spot and will need to be moved back. He refused to cancel who he hired so I was able to reach the guy and cancel myself.

So I asked my neighbor again to move the fence, to which he offered to buy my house for cash for what I owe on my mortgage, not for what the house is worth, which I would lose a ton of money on the deal so I told him no, and he would still need to move the fence for the sale of the house anyway.

So he said in that case he would pay to have a new survey done, and buy the property off me that his fence sits on. He also tried twice again to send the guy back to move my sprinkler heads, but I stopped it again both times.

Yesterday, the survey was done and it was determined that the fence is 40 inches on my property. The fence is touching the back of my shed. My neighbor again asked to buy my property and make the fence the new property line. To which I again said no because the city zoning laws state my shed has to be at least 36 inches from the property line. So my shed is compliant with the current property line but would need to be moved if the fence became the new property line. (It also turns out his shed is on my property too).

His response was that he would pay to have my shed torn down and rebuilt with a smaller shed as mine is too big anyway. I again said no as my shed not only needs to be that size to store my tractor in the winter, but it also houses my pool pump/filter, so moving the location of the shed would require redoing all the piping and electrical. This would cost thousands of dollars and it would be very complicated. 

I again told my neighbor he just needs to move his fence as this is the simplest and cheapest option. He is willing to spend thousands of dollars on these other options instead which makes no sense. His latest response is now that he has gifted me the fence and if I want to move it I can. He is refusing to do anything else now and that I am being unreasonable.

We've been through thick and thin together - in my eyes, this roommate is like a brother. We are now entering fourth year and have signed a lease to live for our third year together.

Because I trust my roommate so much, I tell him everything about myself. When I have an interview, I tell him about the position. When I apply for a club position, I tell him about how excited I am. I want to share everything with him because I trust him.

I guess I was not cautious enough. For some context, we are both applying to medical school. In my country, medical school is very difficult to get into and requires stellar extracurriculars. I have always been very involved on the extracurricular front, and I guess my roommate sees me as a ""template"" for an ideal candidate. Because of this, he has been involving himself in everything I join.

This started with a mentorship program. I was hired as a mentor for first-year university students. The next year, he applied too. I did not think much of it - it is pretty common for students pursuing medical school to have the same EC experience. Next, my friend was having difficulty finding research. I decided to send him my email template, and he ended up finding a position in a lab right beside me in the same research institute. Afterwards, he applied to a vice president position for a club I was president of. Next, I applied to volunteer at a hospital. A month after my application, he applied too. We were both accepted, but at different sites. Upon hearing of my site, he requested to switch to my site.

All of this was enough for me to bear, until I found out that he applied for the president position in the club I was president of.

However, if I were in this situation and wanted to take over my friend's position, I would probably have checked in with them, knowing they dedicated hundreds of hours to the club last year. This friend has never even been part of the club…

To be clear this phone was not lost, it was on my desk in my room partially buried beneath some of my things.

She argued that because it was on my desk then she wasn't digging through my things to find it, and she told me to stop treating her like a thief.

I responded saying she literally stole my old phone and this sparked a back and forth argument of whether she stole it or not.

This morning the argument sparked up again and she tried to claim that the law says: ""A person who knowingly or intentionally exerts unauthorized control over property of another person, with intent to deprive the other person of any part of its value or use, commits theft"" and thus she didn't steal because her intention was just to use it for herself until she got a better phone.

We worked together at the time and when my morning sickness got bed she told me she didn't want to hear me complain about it because at least I could get pregnant,  so I kept to myself.  A couple of months later she also found out she was pregnant, and while my morning sickness was going away around month 4, hers was just starting and she had a really hard time.  I let her know that I understand and to let me know if she needs anything, to which she responded saying that I could not understand because I wasn't ever really sick with my pregnancy. A little further into her pregnancy (month 3), she was diagnosed with hyperemesis and let me know. I let her know that I understand that it is rough, and to let me know if she needed anything or tips/ tricks that might help.  She responded by saying that I could not possibly understand because I didn't really have morning sickness.  I let her know that I did but it was sidings much worse with my first and I also had hyperemesis. She said no that I don't understand because she had hyperemesis gravidarum,  to which I said ""yes, I understand.  I had it really bad with my oldest and it was awful"" to which she said ""I think you just don't understand because you were never sick"" so I left it be and we were on really bad terms the rest of our pregnancies because she said I was insensitive about her having a hard time,  AITA?

Eta her morning sickness also ended up going away at about month 4.",0.0,0.0217462796717882,0,1

I've doing this method of travel for a year and did the stupid thing of not taking my work I to consideration. I made him my focus, not my work or my own well being. Anyway, I told him about how I switched the day and the reason why. He was not pleased to hear about it and I expected it which is the sad part. He was upset about how the agency or the place I might be working at should be basically what sounded that they should instantly give a response. I don't expect it but apparently he does. He's not the one who's been looking for work for almost 4-5 months and has been stressing about moving in together towards the end of the year. Mainly for his sake because all I heard was about finding work but of course, had to be every other weekend just to see him which is hard to find unless that place cares very little about giving hours.

134,1cyitvg,AITA for wanting to advocate cancer and show off my port,"A little context here: I got diagnosed with cancer last summer. It was a type of blood cancer that is about 90% curable. However, the chemotherapy I had to go through was painful and awful. I had to go through it for 6 months but thankfully I have been in remission. I was wearing a wig throughout my treatments but then as my hair grew out I stopped wearing the wig. 

It taught me a lot of things about kindness and it drove my passion for medicine even deeper. So, because of this I would love to be like Tia Bee Stokes (for those of you that don't know she basically dances for those who are fighting cancer).

Basically have freedom. I want to volunteer and maybe even become a visionary of the year for the LLS.  I know in my gut that I was brought in this world to help others and after my experience I want to bring in positivity to those who are suffering.

Although, there is a problem. I have a mom that thinks I should hide myself because of our ethnic family. I understand where she is coming from. My whole family is from another country where we judge each other quite a lot so she's trying to protect me.

Now I don't really care what others think, but the fact that I lost my hair without choice and people are being mean about it hurts me more. I've had lots of arguments with my mom about this and she even cries and tells me all that should matter is that I'm healthy. My mom thinks I should continue wearing outfits that hide my port, which protrudes out of my chest a little and still keep it a secret because she's now worried my family will call, fly all the way here to see me and be upset at my mom for not telling anyone.

135,1cyitqx,AITA: For missing my friends baby shower because I was sick?,"TLDR: I missed the baby shower I helped her plan because I was sick and she iced me out for months. 

I helped her plan the baby shower and 3 days before I got sick. I messaged her 2 days before and continued helping her with a game I was going to run but saying it wasn’t looking good for me attending. 

She said it wasn’t Covid so it was fine. I told her again the day before I likely wasn’t coming and then the morning of texted her and her spouse that I didn’t want to risk her being sick.

I FaceTimed into the shower, my gift was already delivery the day before and I texted again the morning of and  promised to come over in a week when I was in the clear.  

When the next week came I said “what’s your free time today and tomorrow.” She explained she was driving into the city for an appointment would likely be back around 3pm. Around 6pm I mentioned giving some time for a nap since she was driving back from the city and asked again about tomorrow’s schedule. She said it was fine because they honestly didn’t really need my help with anything for nesting and to try again in a few weeks. 

*Mom to be then iced me out for months.*

Today she finally came clean that she was “matching my energy” because  I missed her first baby shower ever and that I left them hanging when I was supposed to come over. 

She’s allowed to be disappointed at my absence but I feel like she is being INSANE and I’m questioning over a decade of friendship over this. Her message was written like I was intentionally trying to miss the shower I helped plan and didn’t make any effort to support her milestone at all!!! We never even set a time for my visit and then she told me not to come (which I now believe was said in jest, but I had no reason to think so at the time). She even said in the message today “I told you you could come anyway” like that would make me un-sick!!! 

I am so taken aback by her message today, and honestly I’m angry. It’s bratty and petty and it’s immature. Also I’m mad that it came months later at MY prompting when she finally started communicating with me directly again. 

I am really hurt by this. I don’t deserve to be treated like crap just because she was pregnant. But I also don’t want to make a post-partum mom feel bad. 

Am I allowed to tell her she sounds crazy after I helped plan her shower and wanted to protect her then-unborn baby and made the effort to make it up? It’s like she’s looking for reasons to build a case that I hate her or something!

Her family would be leaving her in a country she’s only been in for a year and the only family they have is us hence why they want her to stay with us instead of staying home alone.

Was invited to play with this great art community, more focused on graphic arts but they also do concerts. Normally they put the stage and art market in separate rooms, but this always results in having no audience cause everyone spends more time at the market. So, the organizers had the idea to bring it together, graphic artists would be selling in the same room as the stage in a closed room. My band was the 3rd music act. During the 2nd band's show, graphic artists in the group chat started complaining about the noise, saying they couldn't talk to their customers and secure business, which is a fair comment. When it was my time I muffled all the drums, told my audio engineer to try to modulate it and even had a soundcheck right before.

Had a great time at my show, people seemed to like it. But the chat went crazy. My engineer said the not so great gear they rented, the place acoustics and other stuff made it very hard to work with but he tried. A friend who is also a graphic artist politely told them to be flexible this time since musicians have a harder time in this community. Everyone ignored him and kept complaining.

I saw too much tension and sent a light-hearted ""Damn, I'm sorry this happened!"" text (can't translate it to english exactly, I typed it very slangy). Some people reacted positively but it seems others took it as me not being serious about it. So I sent a second, more serious text along the lines of: ""Answering your questions, it was not possible to lower the volume because (reasons my engineer listed).

However I think it's a good thing we identified things that we don't like for feedback. I know you are doing business. Believe me I will also \*fight\* to present my art and sell, since I also earn money here.""

Looking back my delivery wasn't great. Some people misinterpreted as I'm fighting against them, which was not my intention at all. Rather, I meant I was making a huge effort to make this event successful since it directly benefits me. Needless to say, people got very angry at my text and wouldn't listen anymore.

It was a good situation at first but more people moved in and there wasn't enough space and fighting. We stayed in that situation for 12 years before moving into her mother's apartment. Now I pay $700 to rent a bedroom with limited access to the kitchen and bathroom. My girlfriend wants to break up and kick me out because I don't have the money to get our own place. I always have a decent paying job but I can't find the focus to figure out how to move out. My girlfriend is disabled and is eligible for disability checks but I didn't get around to setting it up so she doesn't have an income but I earn enough for both of us. She says she's tired of waiting and that I'll never do it at this point but I love her and want to be with her. I do intend to move out once I get the money so I don't want to be kicked out.

140,1cz5cu4,AITA for booking a hotel/bnb for my mom when she visits town,"I (23F) have a graduation coming up in 2 weeks, and my family will be in town. My other family members attending like my uncles, aunts, and cousins are getting places of their own to stay at while my mom asked to stay with me.

I currently live in a 4-bedroom/2-bath household with 3 other roommates; I share one bathroom with one roommate. My mom's visit will be 5 days, and she and I would essentially have to share my room.

When my mom called me about coming to my graduation, I had initially said yes she can stay with me. But as it's getting closer to the date, I also had another fight with her a couple of days ago about how she has issues with me wanting my whole family (uncles, aunts, and cousins) to have a dinner altogether after my grad ceremony. As it gets closer to the day, I'm dreading her stay in town, especially realizing we'll be sharing my room and bathroom with one other roommate. (also maybe lowkey I am embarrassed to ask my roommates if my mom can stay for 5 days).

My mom has issues with money and tends to victimize herself, especially when my sister or I ask to establish boundaries with her. The dinner issue initially was the same wherein she didn't want to have to cover the bill, and as the celebrant I guess, I even offered to my mom that I split the bill with her.

I don't want to put up with her more than I have to and parent the parent for 5 days. I do intend to find other housing options like a hotel or bnb for her and even paying for it myself just to avoid the lecture about money.

Should I just do it and book the hotel/bnb or let her stay with me
