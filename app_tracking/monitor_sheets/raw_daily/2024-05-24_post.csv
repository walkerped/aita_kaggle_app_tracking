0,1czn0lx,AITA For running away in the middle of a date with my girlfriend to help my mother? (UPDATE),"Hello again reddit.

A lot of stuff has happend the past days, and I don't even know where to start or where my head is at right now. It just feels surreal right now. 

Many of you will be.. Displeased, to hear this, but me and my girlfriend are still together. Apologies to those who commented but didn't got a reply, I did read each and every comment, and took them the heart. Even the ones that came out rougher on the edges. It was eye opening, to say the least. 

It made me realize a lot of stuff. The same day of the original post, I messaged my girlfriend to talk with her, she told me she was at her parent's house, so I went over and we had a talk. I apologized for leaving so abruptly without making sure she was okay, but that I didn't knew any better since that's what I was raised like and what I was taught. She said she understood and apologized for slandering me with her friends, but only wanted her opinion validated. Okay, no biggie.

I told her if she ever felt second in line whenever it came to my mother and she said yes. This was making me open my eyes more and more to the situation at hand, alike the comments were pointing out. I admit I cried a bit and my girlfriend held me and consoled me.

I went to sleep on it and next morning, I took my leave to go confront my parents, my girlfriend insisted in tagging along, but understood when I told her that this was something I had to do on my own.


I arrived at my parent's place, and my mom greeted me like nothing happened. She felt something was off when I didn't reply, and I told her to sit down and have a talk with me.

She looked really worried. I was blunt and outright asked if she was really sick, because the more I thought of it (more like, the more I recall the comments calling me out and her behavior) the more odd it looked. Did she really have seizures? If she has seizures, why does she has her husband call me instead of an ambulance? I pointed out how if those were real seizures, (like I've read online) she'd be either aggressive towards us or have no idea of who she is and where she is and why. 

As a few redditors suspected, she doesn't have seizures. It just turned out to be a controlling movement on her side to keep me around and short leashed. It was one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced, and it genuinely made me nauseous. 

My whole life was built on a lie. You can tell the turmoil, anger, sadness, shock, disappointment, everything going down to me at once. And then,. Y step father walked in. I only asked him once if he was a part into this, and he couldn't look me in the eye.

Right then and there, I knew that I had no family anymore, so I left. On my way to work, I started getting bombarded with calls and texts from her, but I simply blocked her and ignored her. 

So here's where I'm sitting at right now.",UPDATE,2024-05-24,"AITA For running away in the middle of a date with my girlfriend to help my mother? (UPDATE) Hello again reddit.

1,1cziqan,AITA for wanting to kick out my roommate ,"I (19F) ended up staying in my family home after both my parents moved out. Essentially, my Dad had an affair and left. Me and my Mother took in two of my friends and my trans boyfriend (20FTM) during highschool due to them having difficult home lives. My Mum decided to move out once we graduated.

The two friends found better opportunities and moved out, making sure to keep paying rent until we found replacements. 

We had to turn our search to online roommate platforms. Us both being AFAB and queer, we wanted to be very careful about who we picked as we felt unsafe around men.

Eventually after a lot of searching we ended up with with one guy 25M, and although we would have preferred to avoid having a man in the house, we were desperate. This guy seemed pretty chill when we interviewed him. It should have been a red flag at the time but he said he wanted to be honest about the fact that is ex gf was trying to get a restraining order. We had seen our fair share of crazy people, so I brushed it aside thinking that we've all had toxic relationships before.

However now I'm starting to wonder if I'm not getting the full story. He's never been rude to me but he does a lot of small things that just seem inconsiderate.

Rather than go on an infinitely long rant, here's a brief summary of all the things that he's done:

After 3 months living here he still hasn't brought in his mini fridge in from the driveway.

He buys food in bulk, taking up a lot of kitchen space, (I kindly remind you of his un-used mini fridge).

He never uses headphones

Gets up for work at 4am and wakes me up every time because he leaves his car running with the radio on and makes multiple trips back and forth with big heavy boots.

He once left the door open and my old, blind dog wandered out of the house and down the road, we were very lucky he didn't get hurt.

He has left the door unlocked all day while no one was home several times 

Despite bringing his own dishware I'm always the one who ends up doing his dishes.

Sometimes he 'does the dishes' but when I go to put them away later they're not actually clean.

He threw moldy food into the recycling bin.

He told me that after 3 months he's only just found the overhead fan for his ensuite shower. I can't imagine how moldy the ceiling is in there now.

He never puts his rubbish in the bin, he puts in on top of the bin lid.

Uses my handmade pottery (I do ceramics) for his food despite bringing his own bowls.

So many half finished lemonades, energy drinks and wine glasses that get left for weeks.

I don't know what to do. I'm only 19 and I feel like a disgruntled mother taking care of a giant man child. I'm constantly having to do house chores while also having four different jobs. I have no time to myself anymore.

My wonderful boyfriend does help with these chores but even between the two of us there's just so much that we can't keep up with.

2,1czaydz,AITA for not going on a weekend trip with my girlfriend and her EX,"AITA for not wanting to go on a weekend lake trip with my girlfriend with her ex. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 years and before we got together she dated her sisters husbands best friend. We have met before in social settings where we are all together and it is uncomfortable for all of us.

Her brother in law is having a party at his cabin for 3 days and his best friend who she dated is also coming along. There will be a lot of drinking and partying in close quarters with all of his friends who she knows well. 

The guy also does a lot of inside jokes with her and I can’t stand it. He comes off as pompous and obnoxious which doesn’t help the situation. 

The other part of this scenario is that she wasn’t entirely honestly with me about their relationship. She said she broke up with him and it wasn’t a big deal but when I am around her friends they have painted a much different picture. They said that she was heart broken when he didn’t want to be with her anymore and she was devastated for months. She also lied about the duration of their relationship and how they met. 

I know that’s all minor but the lying in addition to the close quarters doesn’t sound like a recipe where I am going to be in high spirits. 
I have been in this scenario before and it wasn’t pleasant nor did it end well.

So I gotta ask am I the asshole for not wanting to go or am I being a little bitch.

It just made me realize how much I had to miss out on and it really upset me because this was the 2nd time I was excluded from an event my family was gonna be at. 

My birthday was yesterday and were planning on celebrating it on Saturday. I told my dad that I didn't want my brother coming and he got sad. He asked me why and I told him how I felt and we kinda had a long talk about everything. He told me that I shouldn't exclude my brother because it would only cause more hurt feelings. My dad said that he understands why I'm upset but that I should just try to forgive because everyone wants to come to celebrate which is the problem.

 My dad told my brother and he told me that he was sorry if I felt left out and that It wasn't his intention but that I'm hurting his feelings because I don't want him to come when he only wants to celebrate with me.

5,1czasrr,AITA for not eating with my step mom? ,"So I had a conversation with my dad today that really pissed me off and idk if I’m valid in my anger or not

Before I start, me and Linda (fake name) dont have a good relationship to start with, she did some stuff in the past (I don’t want to get into it) but it caused me and my brother to stop talking to her and my dad for 3 years

But after those three years we somewhat reconciled and have been on better terms

Due to some unfortunate life circumstances I ended up moving in with Linda and my dad about a year ago and have been living with them since 

Now on to the story, a week ago was Linda’s birthday, and I’m gonna be honest, I didn’t know it was her birthday until my brother asked about it. (I’m awful with dates and struggle to remember my own mom and dad’s birthdays as well) 

She went out to dinner with her mom and when they came back Linda asked if I wanted to have some cake with her, her mom, and my step sister

I said sure and came out, when I did the comments I got from my step grandmother immediately made me feel uncomfortable, she said I came out because I “smelled the food” and then continued to misgender me several times (I’m a heavier guy and have been out as trans for 6 years and on T for 9 months) 

Then Linda misgendered me as well, and I felt extremely uncomfortable and didn’t want to be in that situation anymore, but I was already there and had cake in my hands

So I said thank you and went to go to my room, since I had a feeling the whole time I would be misgendered and I was having a really bad dysphoria day as is

Linda then yells “oh come out here and eat with us!” 

So I went back out and ate with them, I was misgendered a few more times until I finally spoke up and Linda gave a half assed apology for misgendering me

After Linda’s mom left I went back to my room and left the door open and I heard the end of a conversation where Linda said to my dad “and your kid tried to go to her room like a brat” and then walked past my open door

As she did she thanked me for joining them, and as you can imagine, I didn’t really wanna talk to her after that so I acted like I didn’t hear her

She then walks back to my door and said “did you hear me? I said thank you for joining us” 

I just awkwardly nodded and said of course then once she left I closed my door

Then today my dad comes into my room and says that Linda said I was being disrespectful when I tried to go to my room. Then when I tried to explain to him I didn’t want to be misgendered he brushed it off and said it wasn’t that big of a deal and to them I’m still their “daughter”

I was pissed because they’ve known about my transition for 5 years- so it’s not like this is new and they’re still adjusting

I just nodded and agreed until my dad left because my dad doesn’t really understand how others might be upset by things that he doesn’t see as a big deal

But he made me feel like shit for wanting to eat in my bedroom after being misgendered multiple times and hearing Linda’s comment

8,1cza7w5,WIBTA for wanting to cancel my flight to take my wife and her younger siblings on a weekend getaway for Memorial Day Weekend,"I (24M**)** have been married to my wife (22F), but our marriage has been mainly LDR while I'm away for work and she finishes her graduate degree. For Memorial Day Weekend, we were planning a weekend getaway that we usually do this time of year, but in the past, it's been made easier as I was near where she lived, so I could easily drive over, pick her up, and we go on our merry way. This time around, I've moved across country to the West Coast for work. In any case, she brought up the idea of a getaway for the upcoming long-weekend and this time, wanted to include her siblings, who are far younger than she is. Initially, I was onboard, but after realizing how expensive things got (car rental, flights, hotel), and after realizing I would rather do the trip with her alone, I became slow in booking and finalizing trip details. This got to the point where the hotel we were going to stay at sold out and now there is little reason to go anymore because we cannot find a suitable hotel replacement that is within my budget.

I'll be honest, I was a bit slow to book and finalize things when the hotel was still available, but I put it off because of my own personal dread of having to take her siblings with us. I love her family, I genuinely do, but doing anything when she's with her siblings is a lost cause. They're far younger, meaning they're a tad bit more chaotic, and covering all expenses (lodging, car rental, food, etc.) would have inevitably fallen on me, and I'm not in the best of financial positions at the moment. I will add, I recently came back from visiting her and her family this past weekend, where I spent time with her siblings.

I'm struggling of drawing the line between setting a firm boundary for wanting to spend time with just her, and taking care of her as is my obligation (undeniably), alongside taking her siblings (three of them, 19F, 17F, and 6M) on this trip.

Most recently, we got into a tense phone call where she expressed her disappointment and resentment towards me for not coordinating the hotel and not approaching this trip with the same zeal and effort I do all other things (rightfully so), but I'm reluctant to bring up the real reason I don't want to go and that is having to be the ""dad"" during the trip, and not getting to enjoy the time away because I'd have to tend to her and her siblings needs and wants. I've been debating cancelling my trip and just spending time at home relaxing, catching up on sleep, and ultimately saving money for a future surprise birthday trip I wanted to take her on. But I don't want to get on her bad side and have to hear all about how I disappointed her and continue to disappoint her. She just doesn't see the pressure and weight on me for coordinating this trip for her **AND** her younger siblings, especially because she would never do the same for me and my older sister, let alone extend this much effort and support.

She believed terrible rumours about me, saying terrible things about her behind her back. I never said any of these things. I’m hurt and I have no clue who said them. That’s a completely different story though. 

Anyways, one of our mutual friends (who was her friend first) has decided to take her side in this an ice me out. We see each other in public and she ignores me. No smile, wave, anything cordial etc… Lame, but whatever. ANYWAYS the issue: we have Taylor Swift tickets together for August. I bought them. She e transferred me her half. I messaged her yesterday and asked where she saw our friendship going, she replied cordial and nothing more. That she would be moving on without me. I replied “hi, I understand you don’t see this friendship moving forward and as such I will e transfer you your money back for the concert.” 

Her reply “We need to talk about that more. I don’t think it’s fair to just send me the money back. I need the physical ticket to sell or we can sell them as a pair. I purchased the ticket so it’s the ticket I should have.” 

I’m happy to talk more about it. But in my petty feelings: I think its unfair for her to demand a benefit from a friendship she no longer wishes to partake in. Her getting a ticket at all was due to her friendship with me and my hard work to find tickets/codes etc. I am going to sell the ticket to another friend who is going to pay face value for it. Paying her back is putting her in the position she would have been without me, no more and no less. If she was a true friend she would try not to take a side as my other friends have done.

he also tells me to come and give it to him but i’ve told him about twenty times that we’re done wasting gas on him and i’m super busy with friends and driver’s ed along with studying for exams, but his excuses stay the exact same. im still pretty good friends with his sister and she says he lays around the house playing video games all day.

This was a friend who was helping me set up my wedding, planning and all, and honestly, if I wasn’t so close with my sister (who has no interest in wedding planning) she would have been my maid of honor. 

Flash forward to about a month and a half before the wedding, and I get a message from my future SIL (also in the bridal party) asking why ex friend had left the bridesmaids’ chat. I tell her I have no idea and start investigating. Turns out ex friend had blocked both me and now hubby on everything. Text, insta, Facebook, even Venmo (like wtf). Not only that but her boyfriend had blocked us on everything too. With no word, explanation or conversation. Don’t wanna be in the wedding, don’t wanna be my friend, cool, but don’t just block me on everything out of the blue. 

Soon one of the other bridesmaids reached out to her and she informed them that I had “crossed a boundary,” but wouldn’t give any additional information. This was a shock to me as we never had any issues in the 6 years we’ve been friends and have never set any boundaries with one another, other then the obvious boundaries.

It is not uncommon for people from my past to end up planning a vacation here. Most of the time those people reach out and we end up planning to grab dinner or drinks for me to show them around. 
If someone plans a vacation here and doesn't reach out then I take that as my indicator that they do not really care about seeing me. That's fine, everyone is allowed to choose whomever they want in their lives. 
(Work trips don't count because I understand most of your day is working. I'm talking about when people are here for a proper vacation)
My issue is that a few months back I was visiting family and was talking to a cousin that's engaged. Them and their fiance were planning a trip to my city for later in the year so I started talking about some of the places I can show them if they have a free afternoon while they're here. They seemed excited. 
Well, thanks to social media I now know they are currently here on that vacation, but never reached out. 
That's fine, I will just put in less effort. 
My issue is that they have their wedding coming up later this year. I would need to fly to the destination and get accomodations as well as pay for a gift. 
These expenses were all things I was fine with, until now. 
If you can spend a week galavanting around my city and not bother to reach out even if just to say ""sorry, our schedule is too packed"", then why am I going to pay a good chunk of change to go to your wedding? Clearly I'm not worth even a text to you.
This is not a particularly close cousin, but not a distant one either. I get it when people are only doing a quick trip here or when they've jam packed their schedules so they can't see me, but usually people still reach out to at least let me know they were here and will hopefully catch me next time. I never hold their schedule against people, a small text goes a long way in my book. 
I don't wish my cousin any ill will, but WIBTA if I don't pay a bunch of money to go to their wedding in a few months since they can't even bother to send me a text when they're in my town?

That she is just an annoying basic bi@&h and note I have reported this on multiple accounts not only to adults but also to the principle and whole reports on it and nothing has happend to her and she keeps doing this 

But anyways back to the story after she says this I snap and say shut up before  send you to the cotton fields and I know this was wrong to say and this is not my true view on people of different races and I do t like racist people 

But not only has she been racist to me and nothing has happened she also has sent people after me so thought I was in the clear but nope I almost get suspended but luckily I didn’t but I was basically just limited from EVERYTHING. For  a week or to which I’m grateful for but did she get in trouble for anything she did NO and now I’m treated like a bag of dirt or a piece of trash the only people who treat me like a person is one of my teachers and my good friends other than that everyone treats me like shit

And soon she started targeting my girlfriend and I’m not ok with this but I’m not gonna say anything to not get in trouble soon enough she asked why I’m dating her and when I say because I like her and she’s nice to me she says 

That she is just an annoying basic bi@&h and note I have reported this on multiple accounts not only to adults but also to the principle and whole reports on it and nothing has happend to her and she keeps doing this 

But anyways back to the story after she says this I snap and say shut up before  send you to the cotton fields and I know this was wrong to say and this is not my true view on people of different races and I do t like racist people 

But not only has she been racist to me and nothing has happened she also has sent people after me so thought I was in the clear but nope I almost get suspended but luckily I didn’t but I was basically just limited from EVERYTHING. For  a week or to which I’m grateful for but did she get in trouble for anything she did NO and now I’m treated like a bag of dirt or a piece of trash the only people who treat me like a person is one of my teachers and my good friends other than that everyone treats me like shit

I grew up kayaking and was looking forward to it. I had been married 3 years at that point when I mentioned this race to my husband, he was quite discouraging. There ended up being a conflict with the dates and I was unable to participate. I made plans the following year but ended up getting pregnant and had a new born. Over the years there have a few more opportunities for me to participate in the race , however, anytime I bring it up to my husband he has been discouraging and unsupportive. After the birth of our 2nd child, he laughed and told me I wasn't physically able to participate. He's military and sometimes his training has gotten in the way. To participate in a race this long you need a land crew. Each time I've planned to participate he has  had some excuse as to why he can't be the land crew or keep our kids so I can accomplish this goal. One year I had a different land crew and family to keep our kids and he"" put his foot down"" and told me he didn't want me on the river by myself but he also refused to join me because ""he was afraid we would fight in the boat."" 
This year he was asked to be a 2nd in the race with someone else. He eagerly agreed and began making plans to participate. When I told him I was upset that he would ask me to support him in this when he never supported me, he told me I was being selfish and I should be happy for him to get to do this. I asked him why he was suddenly interested and he said he wanted to challenge himself physically. (One of the reasons I wanted to participate.)
He's has never been interested in this race before now, he didn't grow up kayaking and rarely joins me when I go. He has not always been military, he joined after we had been married for 6 years. I have wanted to do this race for awhile but have always put his feelings above mine, or his career goals above my person goals. I'm also a SAHM and put the care of our children above my wants.

21,1cz93s0,AITA for prioritizing me over my disabled friend?,"3 years ago I met a mentally disabled man S in his mid30s through a work colleague.  
He now only does his shopping near the end of my shift, so he can greet me in front of the store after my shift to ""crack open a cold one after missing you all day"".

We met in a bar and got to talking about football (soccer for murricans) and got along great. I made an effort to include him in the group so he would enjoy himself. Ever since that day he started calling me his brother from another mother for life and sees me at work every day. I took him out for walks, to the park, to the bar, to watch a game and other things semi regularly since he always seemed to be alone after work.

He works at a special unit for disabled people, where he can basically just not go to work without real consequences, has a professional social worker (from now PSW) assigned to him and gets a predetermined weekly allowance, but is allowed to live alone. Which, however he should not. 

Why should he not?  
He lives in an appartment that is basically rotting away, despite me helping him clean it multiple times. He just can not keep up with chores. His hygiene is atrocious and his body odour regularly gives me headaches. When i actually visit him at home I make him shower, other times I tell him to remember showering, he just cant or does not want to. He can not handle money. He spends his weekly allowance within 24 hours and tries to bum off me for the rest of the weeik. He is very whiny - if somethings inconvenient he is a baby about it and mopes.

He ""falls in love"" with every woman that gives him 15 mintues of attention. Even if that woman is 15 years old. I instantly contacted his PSW to have him deal with that situation. PSW did absolutely nothing though. I explained to him that he can go to jail for that stuff and he stopped. The girls parents contacted police though and he got into legal trouble. PSW did not even show up to court and his mentally unstable mother just said he was evil. I managed to be allowed to speak for him in court with special admittances and somehow smoothed things over. Ever since that day (about a year ago now) his PSW stopped doing anything really. His mother, his siblings, relatives. Anyone that should care for him, does not. I work 9hour shifts 6 days a week and work out for 2 hours daily. The rest of my time is used on S to help him not rot away in his apartment. I appealed for assisted housing, got denied because he is too independent. supposedly.

I have reached my breaking point now, told him I would not be able to meet him or hang out with him after work for the next 2 weeks. My social life has vanished. I havent seen friends for months because I have no time for it. I want to try rekindling it.

22,1cz8zdo,AITA For wanting my SO to improve themselves?,"My (28M) Girlfriend (26F) recently left her state job in order to pursue a small side business we started together, we agreed this would be a good route as there's more free time and potential for income ($600+/day at times).

Since leaving her job, she has been pretty lazy overall, but with spurts of doing stuff like cleaning, taking care of errands etc. I'm appreciative and always say thank you and how happy it makes me to have a clean home. She has a lot more free time, no longer an 8-5 job, etc. I'd expect her to be doing a lot more with her free time, but she's been sitting at home, barely going out, feeling depressed etc, but refuses to work on it. 

We've discussed goals like going to the gym together or by herself when I'm at work. She hasn't done it. She addresses the issue, says she isn't feeling great about her body (she's gorgeous, all of 110lbs/5ft) for no reason, but then refuses to do something about it. I asked her about going to the gym while I was at work the other day, and her response was ""I'm not fat dickhead.""

I never said she was fat, but I followed up on something we talked about that would help her feel better. I'm upset because 1: if you say something you should do it. 2: I didn't tell you what to do, I simply asked if you were progressing towards your goal. 3: We have a gym in our complex, we've been to it multiple times.

She left her job so we could build and improve our small business (Car Detailing), but due to weather we haven't been busy, we had multiple appointments cancel, which is expected in the rain. I work 12 hours shifts in the Navy, and I can't use our business page at work for obvious reasons.

Today he tells me to be ready and dressed by 4 pm because we have a date planned. I put on a cute outfit because all he told me was we have a special date planned. Any other time he’s said that, the date usually involves us going out to a fancy restaurant. So I put on a skirt, some heels, and a top. He sees my outfit, doesn’t say anything. The only thing I noticed that was odd was that he brought his backpack with him. I asked him why, and he said that he just wanted to put his hoodie somewhere in case it got cold later. 

We get into the car and 20 minutes into the drive I ask him how far is the restaurant we’re going to. He smiles and says, “about an hour”. I pull up my phone and start responding to some work emails to kill time. And then when we arrived to our destination I honestly got so upset.

I ask him what we were doing there and he turns to me and says, “surprise! we’re having a couple’s retreat.

I’m in HEELS AND A SKIRT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS c. HE PACKED PJS, his toothbrush, AND A CHANGE OF CLOTHES BUT DIDNT THINK TO TELL ME ID BE NEEDING ANYTHING FOR THIS DATE. 

At that point I just blatantly ask him, “have I ever expressed any interest in camping to you?” He said, “no.” And then I followed up with, “you know how much I hate small spaces, what made you think I’d enjoy this, I just really want to understand?” He didn’t say anything.

26,1cz89lp,AITAH for trying to plan a date with the new guy in my life? ,"We’ve been talking to each for a couple of months now, and have gone out on 3 dates. I’m a single mom of a 12 year old. My kiddo lives with me full time and visits their dad every other weekend. My kid free weekends are when I typically go on dates and or hang with friends. My next kid free weekend, the guy I’ve been dating will be out of state visiting with family. So, we decided to see each other on the following Sunday. We’ve been excited about it for days. He’ll be coming back from his trip the Monday prior, has Tuesday off, and will be working Wednesday through Saturday. I work Monday-Friday. So, Sunday seemed like the best option because we live an hour away from each other, and Tuesday he would likely need to prepare for the work week (we discussed this on our last date). Anyhow, yesterday I realized I had mixed up my days and that my kiddo was going to be with me on the Sunday we’ve been planning to meet up. I explained it to him and told him we can still meet for a couple hours or so. That’s when his whole tune changed. After several texts of trying to problem solve and avoid having to wait a whole month to see each other, it seemed to me that we needed to clear things up with a phone conversation. He agreed. But, when we talked, he accused me of not caring about his schedule and what mattered to him. That I was being controlling and guilt tripping him. And he compared me to his ex. I apologized for making him feel that way, and told him that wasn’t my intention, but he continued to scold me. I told him we didn’t have to meet on that day (I was never set on it), that I was open to other days (as I had been saying, and asking him for suggestions throughout the day) or just waiting until my next kid free weekend. He then proceeded to say, “No. It’s settled, we’re seeing each other on the 9th”. I declined, saying that it wouldn’t be in our best interest due to the circumstances, and we should just wait. He ended the call by saying he’d be processing this for a couple days and will probably be short with me.

Whenever we ask he always insists he's tired and just wants to be home.

Whenever we try to ask him or joke about him never wanting to be around us he gets defensive and insists we push his boundaries. We have had talks about boundaries but only when he blows up on us for something we did not know bothered him. We try not to bother him but now it feels like walking on eggshells while he makes offensive jokes and it is never an issue.

Last year she got a new job and had to travel a lot for it. It was tough, but there was an obvious strain on MY job which came to a head at the end of summer. She was staying in a hotel in a city 2 hours away for 5 days at a time during her training period, and one morning her alarm didn't go off for whatever reason.

During this time, I was responsible for a company site wide machine refresh where I was set to install new computers at our retail locations which meant that I was using a company vehicle to transport machines and travel across the coverage area.

She proceeded to have a panic attack when she realized she might have to call in to her job, when I explained to her that there wasn't enough time to get her there and for me to get to work on time. It was almost a full on meltdown. I relented and took her with me in the company vehicle, which was a no-no. One of the store managers took pictures of her sitting in the truck and forwarded them to my boss.

I lost my job, but that isn't the worst part - during this installation, I developed an over-use injury from all the heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, climbing and stacking the project required. Two vertebrae in my thoracic spine had become severely compromised and were sawing into my spinal cord and I had to have surgery. I now have a 13cm rod, 24 screws, and 2 laminar strips in my back and a lifetime of pain and discomfort. 

It has been 8 months and I am still recovering. 

I am fighting with the Workman's Comp insurance and have a settlement and disability hearing on the horizon, but all of that takes time. In the mean time, I do not have unemployment insurance. My initial claim was denied so there's been almost no money coming in.

I asked her what she wanted or expects and she said she expects me to contribute to the household. Its affected every level of our relationship. I don't think she likes me any more, to be perfectly honest. Her happiness or satisfaction seems to depend solely on me bringing in an equal amount of money. What she doesn't seem to care about is that I keep the house clean, the dog fed and healthy, and I cook for her and do her laundry.

She gets mad when I spend money on food, on gas, or on anything really. I've done side-work where I can, sold paintings. I've also sold everything I own.

31,1cz7o81,AITA for not waiting to make my wife happy,"AITA for not wanting to move into a new house?

So me and my fiancé talked about moving previously. We both own our own homes and my house is a new construction that was build during Covid so it’s got an interest rate under 3% and the P&I is less than $1400 for a 2700sq ft house. Her house is about 1400sq ft and she refinanced it during Covid to make it affordable but it’s less than 200K that she owes on the house. 

Well last year we spoke about it where I didn’t want to move due to even selling her house it was going to be cheaper to live in my house than buying a new one along with the fact that expenses are going to increase even we are together and have kids in the future which I thing she has thought of but not to the fact of day care costs being expensive.

Her reasoning behind it was that we’re both getting married so let’s get something together that we can call our own not just one of us moving into the others. Plus her commute from my house which we had agreed to move into would be too far. Plus even I said even if we sell both of houses (which I would like to keep mine as a rental so even if it’s 500/month of cash flow that’s still something extra coming in) it’s still going to be more than what I pay for the P&I. that she said well we could downsize which I advised that it doesn’t make sense to do that even if she was unhappy before being laid off at her job. Under to the point where it was triggering her ptsd and she was having nightmares about her job and walking on egg shells at the office

Well we’re both living about to get married soon and she got laid off from her job which has switched  to be closer to my house but her original job was changing offices and was going to be even further away than anything she wanted to find along with the politics of the workplace. 

Well she got laid off like I said and brought up would I reconsider moving if she gets a job in downtown (I live about 40-45 min from center city in the next county) and I would consider it but I don’t want to move 

So am I the asshole for not considering moving even though we might be worse financially but mentally she’ll be happier because it’s closer to her new job that she gets whenever?

The moment my best friend called me I was on the next flight out. My best friend mom was like my mom. I had a rough childhood growing up and both parents were never around. However my best friends mother side of the family hated me. I honestly never knew the reason. They constantly told her I was just another mouth to feed and it broke me. However she still always made sure I had enough in life. She went to all my big moments in life. My best friend and I were an unstoppable duo. Even now we still are at least that's what I like to think. When I had made it to the house I went inside and her family were surrounding her and she didn't even look all the way there. The moment she saw me. She ran to me and hugged me.  We both cried and I helped her around the house. Helping her pick out what she wanted her mom to wear. Her family had a lot to say to me about how there wasn't enough people to stay at the house and wanted me to get a hotel. Since only the family wanted family there. My best friend wanted me there but she was looking after her brothers kids since they were in the room with her. So I ended up getting a hotel room. Which is okay. I understand and brushed it off. When we got to the funeral family sits in the front row. I was planning on sitting next to my best friend but there was a whole entire scene with her family a and my best friend looked tired and so done. So I decided to sit at the back since I didn't want to cause anymore disruption. Once the funeral was done my best friend and I got into argument. She told me I never cared about her mom and how I should have fought them back to sit next to her. She told me I was an asshole and to not speak to her again my heart was shattered by her words. I'm currently still at the hotel. I leave in a couple of days and I don't want to leave with this big fight between us. What should I do? Was I the asshole? She's the only person I have left and I don't want to leave things this way between us. Any advice is appreciated! ,Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,AITA For not sitting next to my best friend during her mothers funeral.  So my best friend mother died a few days ago and we had the funeral yesterday. The moment my best friend called me I was on the next flight out. My best friend mom was like my mom. I had a rough childhood growing up and both parents were never around. However my best friends mother side of the family hated me. I honestly never knew the reason. They constantly told her I was just another mouth to feed and it broke me. However she still always made sure I had enough in life. She went to all my big moments in life. My best friend and I were an unstoppable duo. Even now we still are at least that's what I like to think.
