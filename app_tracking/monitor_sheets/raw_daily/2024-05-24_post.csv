0,1czn0lx,AITA For running away in the middle of a date with my girlfriend to help my mother? (UPDATE),"Hello again reddit.

A lot of stuff has happend the past days, and I don't even know where to start or where my head is at right now. It just feels surreal right now. 

Many of you will be.. Displeased, to hear this, but me and my girlfriend are still together. Apologies to those who commented but didn't got a reply, I did read each and every comment, and took them the heart. Even the ones that came out rougher on the edges. It was eye opening, to say the least. 

It made me realize a lot of stuff. The same day of the original post, I messaged my girlfriend to talk with her, she told me she was at her parent's house, so I went over and we had a talk. I apologized for leaving so abruptly without making sure she was okay, but that I didn't knew any better since that's what I was raised like and what I was taught. She said she understood and apologized for slandering me with her friends, but only wanted her opinion validated. Okay, no biggie.

I told her if she ever felt second in line whenever it came to my mother and she said yes. This was making me open my eyes more and more to the situation at hand, alike the comments were pointing out. I admit I cried a bit and my girlfriend held me and consoled me.

I went to sleep on it and next morning, I took my leave to go confront my parents, my girlfriend insisted in tagging along, but understood when I told her that this was something I had to do on my own.


I arrived at my parent's place, and my mom greeted me like nothing happened. She felt something was off when I didn't reply, and I told her to sit down and have a talk with me.

She looked really worried. I was blunt and outright asked if she was really sick, because the more I thought of it (more like, the more I recall the comments calling me out and her behavior) the more odd it looked. Did she really have seizures? If she has seizures, why does she has her husband call me instead of an ambulance? I pointed out how if those were real seizures, (like I've read online) she'd be either aggressive towards us or have no idea of who she is and where she is and why. 

As a few redditors suspected, she doesn't have seizures. It just turned out to be a controlling movement on her side to keep me around and short leashed. It was one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced, and it genuinely made me nauseous. 

My whole life was built on a lie. You can tell the turmoil, anger, sadness, shock, disappointment, everything going down to me at once. And then,. Y step father walked in. I only asked him once if he was a part into this, and he couldn't look me in the eye.

Right then and there, I knew that I had no family anymore, so I left. On my way to work, I started getting bombarded with calls and texts from her, but I simply blocked her and ignored her. 

So here's where I'm sitting at right now.",UPDATE,2024-05-24,"AITA For running away in the middle of a date with my girlfriend to help my mother? (UPDATE) Hello again reddit.

1,1cziqan,AITA for wanting to kick out my roommate ,"I (19F) ended up staying in my family home after both my parents moved out. Essentially, my Dad had an affair and left. Me and my Mother took in two of my friends and my trans boyfriend (20FTM) during highschool due to them having difficult home lives. My Mum decided to move out once we graduated.

The two friends found better opportunities and moved out, making sure to keep paying rent until we found replacements. 

We had to turn our search to online roommate platforms. Us both being AFAB and queer, we wanted to be very careful about who we picked as we felt unsafe around men.

Eventually after a lot of searching we ended up with with one guy 25M, and although we would have preferred to avoid having a man in the house, we were desperate. This guy seemed pretty chill when we interviewed him. It should have been a red flag at the time but he said he wanted to be honest about the fact that is ex gf was trying to get a restraining order. We had seen our fair share of crazy people, so I brushed it aside thinking that we've all had toxic relationships before.

However now I'm starting to wonder if I'm not getting the full story. He's never been rude to me but he does a lot of small things that just seem inconsiderate.

Rather than go on an infinitely long rant, here's a brief summary of all the things that he's done:

After 3 months living here he still hasn't brought in his mini fridge in from the driveway.

He buys food in bulk, taking up a lot of kitchen space, (I kindly remind you of his un-used mini fridge).

He never uses headphones

Gets up for work at 4am and wakes me up every time because he leaves his car running with the radio on and makes multiple trips back and forth with big heavy boots.

He once left the door open and my old, blind dog wandered out of the house and down the road, we were very lucky he didn't get hurt.

He has left the door unlocked all day while no one was home several times 

Despite bringing his own dishware I'm always the one who ends up doing his dishes.

Sometimes he 'does the dishes' but when I go to put them away later they're not actually clean.

He threw moldy food into the recycling bin.

He told me that after 3 months he's only just found the overhead fan for his ensuite shower. I can't imagine how moldy the ceiling is in there now.

He never puts his rubbish in the bin, he puts in on top of the bin lid.

Uses my handmade pottery (I do ceramics) for his food despite bringing his own bowls.

So many half finished lemonades, energy drinks and wine glasses that get left for weeks.

I don't know what to do. I'm only 19 and I feel like a disgruntled mother taking care of a giant man child. I'm constantly having to do house chores while also having four different jobs. I have no time to myself anymore.

My wonderful boyfriend does help with these chores but even between the two of us there's just so much that we can't keep up with.

2,1czaydz,AITA for not going on a weekend trip with my girlfriend and her EX,"AITA for not wanting to go on a weekend lake trip with my girlfriend with her ex. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 years and before we got together she dated her sisters husbands best friend. We have met before in social settings where we are all together and it is uncomfortable for all of us.

Her brother in law is having a party at his cabin for 3 days and his best friend who she dated is also coming along. There will be a lot of drinking and partying in close quarters with all of his friends who she knows well. 

The guy also does a lot of inside jokes with her and I can’t stand it. He comes off as pompous and obnoxious which doesn’t help the situation. 

The other part of this scenario is that she wasn’t entirely honestly with me about their relationship. She said she broke up with him and it wasn’t a big deal but when I am around her friends they have painted a much different picture. They said that she was heart broken when he didn’t want to be with her anymore and she was devastated for months. She also lied about the duration of their relationship and how they met. 

I know that’s all minor but the lying in addition to the close quarters doesn’t sound like a recipe where I am going to be in high spirits. 
I have been in this scenario before and it wasn’t pleasant nor did it end well.

So I gotta ask am I the asshole for not wanting to go or am I being a little bitch.

It just made me realize how much I had to miss out on and it really upset me because this was the 2nd time I was excluded from an event my family was gonna be at. 

My birthday was yesterday and were planning on celebrating it on Saturday. I told my dad that I didn't want my brother coming and he got sad. He asked me why and I told him how I felt and we kinda had a long talk about everything. He told me that I shouldn't exclude my brother because it would only cause more hurt feelings. My dad said that he understands why I'm upset but that I should just try to forgive because everyone wants to come to celebrate which is the problem.

 My dad told my brother and he told me that he was sorry if I felt left out and that It wasn't his intention but that I'm hurting his feelings because I don't want him to come when he only wants to celebrate with me.

5,1czasrr,AITA for not eating with my step mom? ,"So I had a conversation with my dad today that really pissed me off and idk if I’m valid in my anger or not

Before I start, me and Linda (fake name) dont have a good relationship to start with, she did some stuff in the past (I don’t want to get into it) but it caused me and my brother to stop talking to her and my dad for 3 years

But after those three years we somewhat reconciled and have been on better terms

Due to some unfortunate life circumstances I ended up moving in with Linda and my dad about a year ago and have been living with them since 

Now on to the story, a week ago was Linda’s birthday, and I’m gonna be honest, I didn’t know it was her birthday until my brother asked about it. (I’m awful with dates and struggle to remember my own mom and dad’s birthdays as well) 

She went out to dinner with her mom and when they came back Linda asked if I wanted to have some cake with her, her mom, and my step sister

I said sure and came out, when I did the comments I got from my step grandmother immediately made me feel uncomfortable, she said I came out because I “smelled the food” and then continued to misgender me several times (I’m a heavier guy and have been out as trans for 6 years and on T for 9 months) 

Then Linda misgendered me as well, and I felt extremely uncomfortable and didn’t want to be in that situation anymore, but I was already there and had cake in my hands

So I said thank you and went to go to my room, since I had a feeling the whole time I would be misgendered and I was having a really bad dysphoria day as is

Linda then yells “oh come out here and eat with us!” 

So I went back out and ate with them, I was misgendered a few more times until I finally spoke up and Linda gave a half assed apology for misgendering me

After Linda’s mom left I went back to my room and left the door open and I heard the end of a conversation where Linda said to my dad “and your kid tried to go to her room like a brat” and then walked past my open door

As she did she thanked me for joining them, and as you can imagine, I didn’t really wanna talk to her after that so I acted like I didn’t hear her

She then walks back to my door and said “did you hear me? I said thank you for joining us” 

I just awkwardly nodded and said of course then once she left I closed my door

Then today my dad comes into my room and says that Linda said I was being disrespectful when I tried to go to my room. Then when I tried to explain to him I didn’t want to be misgendered he brushed it off and said it wasn’t that big of a deal and to them I’m still their “daughter”

I was pissed because they’ve known about my transition for 5 years- so it’s not like this is new and they’re still adjusting

I just nodded and agreed until my dad left because my dad doesn’t really understand how others might be upset by things that he doesn’t see as a big deal

But he made me feel like shit for wanting to eat in my bedroom after being misgendered multiple times and hearing Linda’s comment

8,1cza7w5,WIBTA for wanting to cancel my flight to take my wife and her younger siblings on a weekend getaway for Memorial Day Weekend,"I (24M**)** have been married to my wife (22F), but our marriage has been mainly LDR while I'm away for work and she finishes her graduate degree. For Memorial Day Weekend, we were planning a weekend getaway that we usually do this time of year, but in the past, it's been made easier as I was near where she lived, so I could easily drive over, pick her up, and we go on our merry way. This time around, I've moved across country to the West Coast for work. In any case, she brought up the idea of a getaway for the upcoming long-weekend and this time, wanted to include her siblings, who are far younger than she is. Initially, I was onboard, but after realizing how expensive things got (car rental, flights, hotel), and after realizing I would rather do the trip with her alone, I became slow in booking and finalizing trip details. This got to the point where the hotel we were going to stay at sold out and now there is little reason to go anymore because we cannot find a suitable hotel replacement that is within my budget.

I'll be honest, I was a bit slow to book and finalize things when the hotel was still available, but I put it off because of my own personal dread of having to take her siblings with us. I love her family, I genuinely do, but doing anything when she's with her siblings is a lost cause. They're far younger, meaning they're a tad bit more chaotic, and covering all expenses (lodging, car rental, food, etc.) would have inevitably fallen on me, and I'm not in the best of financial positions at the moment. I will add, I recently came back from visiting her and her family this past weekend, where I spent time with her siblings.

I'm struggling of drawing the line between setting a firm boundary for wanting to spend time with just her, and taking care of her as is my obligation (undeniably), alongside taking her siblings (three of them, 19F, 17F, and 6M) on this trip.

Most recently, we got into a tense phone call where she expressed her disappointment and resentment towards me for not coordinating the hotel and not approaching this trip with the same zeal and effort I do all other things (rightfully so), but I'm reluctant to bring up the real reason I don't want to go and that is having to be the ""dad"" during the trip, and not getting to enjoy the time away because I'd have to tend to her and her siblings needs and wants. I've been debating cancelling my trip and just spending time at home relaxing, catching up on sleep, and ultimately saving money for a future surprise birthday trip I wanted to take her on. But I don't want to get on her bad side and have to hear all about how I disappointed her and continue to disappoint her. She just doesn't see the pressure and weight on me for coordinating this trip for her **AND** her younger siblings, especially because she would never do the same for me and my older sister, let alone extend this much effort and support.

She believed terrible rumours about me, saying terrible things about her behind her back. I never said any of these things. I’m hurt and I have no clue who said them. That’s a completely different story though. 

Anyways, one of our mutual friends (who was her friend first) has decided to take her side in this an ice me out. We see each other in public and she ignores me. No smile, wave, anything cordial etc… Lame, but whatever. ANYWAYS the issue: we have Taylor Swift tickets together for August. I bought them. She e transferred me her half. I messaged her yesterday and asked where she saw our friendship going, she replied cordial and nothing more. That she would be moving on without me. I replied “hi, I understand you don’t see this friendship moving forward and as such I will e transfer you your money back for the concert.” 

Her reply “We need to talk about that more. I don’t think it’s fair to just send me the money back. I need the physical ticket to sell or we can sell them as a pair. I purchased the ticket so it’s the ticket I should have.” 

I’m happy to talk more about it. But in my petty feelings: I think its unfair for her to demand a benefit from a friendship she no longer wishes to partake in. Her getting a ticket at all was due to her friendship with me and my hard work to find tickets/codes etc. I am going to sell the ticket to another friend who is going to pay face value for it. Paying her back is putting her in the position she would have been without me, no more and no less. If she was a true friend she would try not to take a side as my other friends have done.

he also tells me to come and give it to him but i’ve told him about twenty times that we’re done wasting gas on him and i’m super busy with friends and driver’s ed along with studying for exams, but his excuses stay the exact same. im still pretty good friends with his sister and she says he lays around the house playing video games all day.

This was a friend who was helping me set up my wedding, planning and all, and honestly, if I wasn’t so close with my sister (who has no interest in wedding planning) she would have been my maid of honor. 

Flash forward to about a month and a half before the wedding, and I get a message from my future SIL (also in the bridal party) asking why ex friend had left the bridesmaids’ chat. I tell her I have no idea and start investigating. Turns out ex friend had blocked both me and now hubby on everything. Text, insta, Facebook, even Venmo (like wtf). Not only that but her boyfriend had blocked us on everything too. With no word, explanation or conversation. Don’t wanna be in the wedding, don’t wanna be my friend, cool, but don’t just block me on everything out of the blue. 

Soon one of the other bridesmaids reached out to her and she informed them that I had “crossed a boundary,” but wouldn’t give any additional information. This was a shock to me as we never had any issues in the 6 years we’ve been friends and have never set any boundaries with one another, other then the obvious boundaries.

It is not uncommon for people from my past to end up planning a vacation here. Most of the time those people reach out and we end up planning to grab dinner or drinks for me to show them around. 
If someone plans a vacation here and doesn't reach out then I take that as my indicator that they do not really care about seeing me. That's fine, everyone is allowed to choose whomever they want in their lives. 
(Work trips don't count because I understand most of your day is working. I'm talking about when people are here for a proper vacation)
My issue is that a few months back I was visiting family and was talking to a cousin that's engaged. Them and their fiance were planning a trip to my city for later in the year so I started talking about some of the places I can show them if they have a free afternoon while they're here. They seemed excited. 
Well, thanks to social media I now know they are currently here on that vacation, but never reached out. 
That's fine, I will just put in less effort. 
My issue is that they have their wedding coming up later this year. I would need to fly to the destination and get accomodations as well as pay for a gift. 
These expenses were all things I was fine with, until now. 
If you can spend a week galavanting around my city and not bother to reach out even if just to say ""sorry, our schedule is too packed"", then why am I going to pay a good chunk of change to go to your wedding? Clearly I'm not worth even a text to you.
This is not a particularly close cousin, but not a distant one either. I get it when people are only doing a quick trip here or when they've jam packed their schedules so they can't see me, but usually people still reach out to at least let me know they were here and will hopefully catch me next time. I never hold their schedule against people, a small text goes a long way in my book. 
I don't wish my cousin any ill will, but WIBTA if I don't pay a bunch of money to go to their wedding in a few months since they can't even bother to send me a text when they're in my town?

That she is just an annoying basic bi@&h and note I have reported this on multiple accounts not only to adults but also to the principle and whole reports on it and nothing has happend to her and she keeps doing this 

But anyways back to the story after she says this I snap and say shut up before  send you to the cotton fields and I know this was wrong to say and this is not my true view on people of different races and I do t like racist people 

But not only has she been racist to me and nothing has happened she also has sent people after me so thought I was in the clear but nope I almost get suspended but luckily I didn’t but I was basically just limited from EVERYTHING. For  a week or to which I’m grateful for but did she get in trouble for anything she did NO and now I’m treated like a bag of dirt or a piece of trash the only people who treat me like a person is one of my teachers and my good friends other than that everyone treats me like shit

And soon she started targeting my girlfriend and I’m not ok with this but I’m not gonna say anything to not get in trouble soon enough she asked why I’m dating her and when I say because I like her and she’s nice to me she says 

That she is just an annoying basic bi@&h and note I have reported this on multiple accounts not only to adults but also to the principle and whole reports on it and nothing has happend to her and she keeps doing this 

But anyways back to the story after she says this I snap and say shut up before  send you to the cotton fields and I know this was wrong to say and this is not my true view on people of different races and I do t like racist people 

But not only has she been racist to me and nothing has happened she also has sent people after me so thought I was in the clear but nope I almost get suspended but luckily I didn’t but I was basically just limited from EVERYTHING. For  a week or to which I’m grateful for but did she get in trouble for anything she did NO and now I’m treated like a bag of dirt or a piece of trash the only people who treat me like a person is one of my teachers and my good friends other than that everyone treats me like shit

I grew up kayaking and was looking forward to it. I had been married 3 years at that point when I mentioned this race to my husband, he was quite discouraging. There ended up being a conflict with the dates and I was unable to participate. I made plans the following year but ended up getting pregnant and had a new born. Over the years there have a few more opportunities for me to participate in the race , however, anytime I bring it up to my husband he has been discouraging and unsupportive. After the birth of our 2nd child, he laughed and told me I wasn't physically able to participate. He's military and sometimes his training has gotten in the way. To participate in a race this long you need a land crew. Each time I've planned to participate he has  had some excuse as to why he can't be the land crew or keep our kids so I can accomplish this goal. One year I had a different land crew and family to keep our kids and he"" put his foot down"" and told me he didn't want me on the river by myself but he also refused to join me because ""he was afraid we would fight in the boat."" 
This year he was asked to be a 2nd in the race with someone else. He eagerly agreed and began making plans to participate. When I told him I was upset that he would ask me to support him in this when he never supported me, he told me I was being selfish and I should be happy for him to get to do this. I asked him why he was suddenly interested and he said he wanted to challenge himself physically. (One of the reasons I wanted to participate.)
He's has never been interested in this race before now, he didn't grow up kayaking and rarely joins me when I go. He has not always been military, he joined after we had been married for 6 years. I have wanted to do this race for awhile but have always put his feelings above mine, or his career goals above my person goals. I'm also a SAHM and put the care of our children above my wants.

21,1cz93s0,AITA for prioritizing me over my disabled friend?,"3 years ago I met a mentally disabled man S in his mid30s through a work colleague.  
He now only does his shopping near the end of my shift, so he can greet me in front of the store after my shift to ""crack open a cold one after missing you all day"".

We met in a bar and got to talking about football (soccer for murricans) and got along great. I made an effort to include him in the group so he would enjoy himself. Ever since that day he started calling me his brother from another mother for life and sees me at work every day. I took him out for walks, to the park, to the bar, to watch a game and other things semi regularly since he always seemed to be alone after work.

He works at a special unit for disabled people, where he can basically just not go to work without real consequences, has a professional social worker (from now PSW) assigned to him and gets a predetermined weekly allowance, but is allowed to live alone. Which, however he should not. 

Why should he not?  
He lives in an appartment that is basically rotting away, despite me helping him clean it multiple times. He just can not keep up with chores. His hygiene is atrocious and his body odour regularly gives me headaches. When i actually visit him at home I make him shower, other times I tell him to remember showering, he just cant or does not want to. He can not handle money. He spends his weekly allowance within 24 hours and tries to bum off me for the rest of the weeik. He is very whiny - if somethings inconvenient he is a baby about it and mopes.

He ""falls in love"" with every woman that gives him 15 mintues of attention. Even if that woman is 15 years old. I instantly contacted his PSW to have him deal with that situation. PSW did absolutely nothing though. I explained to him that he can go to jail for that stuff and he stopped. The girls parents contacted police though and he got into legal trouble. PSW did not even show up to court and his mentally unstable mother just said he was evil. I managed to be allowed to speak for him in court with special admittances and somehow smoothed things over. Ever since that day (about a year ago now) his PSW stopped doing anything really. His mother, his siblings, relatives. Anyone that should care for him, does not. I work 9hour shifts 6 days a week and work out for 2 hours daily. The rest of my time is used on S to help him not rot away in his apartment. I appealed for assisted housing, got denied because he is too independent. supposedly.

I have reached my breaking point now, told him I would not be able to meet him or hang out with him after work for the next 2 weeks. My social life has vanished. I havent seen friends for months because I have no time for it. I want to try rekindling it.

22,1cz8zdo,AITA For wanting my SO to improve themselves?,"My (28M) Girlfriend (26F) recently left her state job in order to pursue a small side business we started together, we agreed this would be a good route as there's more free time and potential for income ($600+/day at times).

Since leaving her job, she has been pretty lazy overall, but with spurts of doing stuff like cleaning, taking care of errands etc. I'm appreciative and always say thank you and how happy it makes me to have a clean home. She has a lot more free time, no longer an 8-5 job, etc. I'd expect her to be doing a lot more with her free time, but she's been sitting at home, barely going out, feeling depressed etc, but refuses to work on it. 

We've discussed goals like going to the gym together or by herself when I'm at work. She hasn't done it. She addresses the issue, says she isn't feeling great about her body (she's gorgeous, all of 110lbs/5ft) for no reason, but then refuses to do something about it. I asked her about going to the gym while I was at work the other day, and her response was ""I'm not fat dickhead.""

I never said she was fat, but I followed up on something we talked about that would help her feel better. I'm upset because 1: if you say something you should do it. 2: I didn't tell you what to do, I simply asked if you were progressing towards your goal. 3: We have a gym in our complex, we've been to it multiple times.

She left her job so we could build and improve our small business (Car Detailing), but due to weather we haven't been busy, we had multiple appointments cancel, which is expected in the rain. I work 12 hours shifts in the Navy, and I can't use our business page at work for obvious reasons.

Today he tells me to be ready and dressed by 4 pm because we have a date planned. I put on a cute outfit because all he told me was we have a special date planned. Any other time he’s said that, the date usually involves us going out to a fancy restaurant. So I put on a skirt, some heels, and a top. He sees my outfit, doesn’t say anything. The only thing I noticed that was odd was that he brought his backpack with him. I asked him why, and he said that he just wanted to put his hoodie somewhere in case it got cold later. 

We get into the car and 20 minutes into the drive I ask him how far is the restaurant we’re going to. He smiles and says, “about an hour”. I pull up my phone and start responding to some work emails to kill time. And then when we arrived to our destination I honestly got so upset.

I ask him what we were doing there and he turns to me and says, “surprise! we’re having a couple’s retreat.

I’m in HEELS AND A SKIRT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS c. HE PACKED PJS, his toothbrush, AND A CHANGE OF CLOTHES BUT DIDNT THINK TO TELL ME ID BE NEEDING ANYTHING FOR THIS DATE. 

At that point I just blatantly ask him, “have I ever expressed any interest in camping to you?” He said, “no.” And then I followed up with, “you know how much I hate small spaces, what made you think I’d enjoy this, I just really want to understand?” He didn’t say anything.

26,1cz89lp,AITAH for trying to plan a date with the new guy in my life? ,"We’ve been talking to each for a couple of months now, and have gone out on 3 dates. I’m a single mom of a 12 year old. My kiddo lives with me full time and visits their dad every other weekend. My kid free weekends are when I typically go on dates and or hang with friends. My next kid free weekend, the guy I’ve been dating will be out of state visiting with family. So, we decided to see each other on the following Sunday. We’ve been excited about it for days. He’ll be coming back from his trip the Monday prior, has Tuesday off, and will be working Wednesday through Saturday. I work Monday-Friday. So, Sunday seemed like the best option because we live an hour away from each other, and Tuesday he would likely need to prepare for the work week (we discussed this on our last date). Anyhow, yesterday I realized I had mixed up my days and that my kiddo was going to be with me on the Sunday we’ve been planning to meet up. I explained it to him and told him we can still meet for a couple hours or so. That’s when his whole tune changed. After several texts of trying to problem solve and avoid having to wait a whole month to see each other, it seemed to me that we needed to clear things up with a phone conversation. He agreed. But, when we talked, he accused me of not caring about his schedule and what mattered to him. That I was being controlling and guilt tripping him. And he compared me to his ex. I apologized for making him feel that way, and told him that wasn’t my intention, but he continued to scold me. I told him we didn’t have to meet on that day (I was never set on it), that I was open to other days (as I had been saying, and asking him for suggestions throughout the day) or just waiting until my next kid free weekend. He then proceeded to say, “No. It’s settled, we’re seeing each other on the 9th”. I declined, saying that it wouldn’t be in our best interest due to the circumstances, and we should just wait. He ended the call by saying he’d be processing this for a couple days and will probably be short with me.

Whenever we ask he always insists he's tired and just wants to be home.

Whenever we try to ask him or joke about him never wanting to be around us he gets defensive and insists we push his boundaries. We have had talks about boundaries but only when he blows up on us for something we did not know bothered him. We try not to bother him but now it feels like walking on eggshells while he makes offensive jokes and it is never an issue.

Last year she got a new job and had to travel a lot for it. It was tough, but there was an obvious strain on MY job which came to a head at the end of summer. She was staying in a hotel in a city 2 hours away for 5 days at a time during her training period, and one morning her alarm didn't go off for whatever reason.

During this time, I was responsible for a company site wide machine refresh where I was set to install new computers at our retail locations which meant that I was using a company vehicle to transport machines and travel across the coverage area.

She proceeded to have a panic attack when she realized she might have to call in to her job, when I explained to her that there wasn't enough time to get her there and for me to get to work on time. It was almost a full on meltdown. I relented and took her with me in the company vehicle, which was a no-no. One of the store managers took pictures of her sitting in the truck and forwarded them to my boss.

I lost my job, but that isn't the worst part - during this installation, I developed an over-use injury from all the heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, climbing and stacking the project required. Two vertebrae in my thoracic spine had become severely compromised and were sawing into my spinal cord and I had to have surgery. I now have a 13cm rod, 24 screws, and 2 laminar strips in my back and a lifetime of pain and discomfort. 

It has been 8 months and I am still recovering. 

I am fighting with the Workman's Comp insurance and have a settlement and disability hearing on the horizon, but all of that takes time. In the mean time, I do not have unemployment insurance. My initial claim was denied so there's been almost no money coming in.

I asked her what she wanted or expects and she said she expects me to contribute to the household. Its affected every level of our relationship. I don't think she likes me any more, to be perfectly honest. Her happiness or satisfaction seems to depend solely on me bringing in an equal amount of money. What she doesn't seem to care about is that I keep the house clean, the dog fed and healthy, and I cook for her and do her laundry.

She gets mad when I spend money on food, on gas, or on anything really. I've done side-work where I can, sold paintings. I've also sold everything I own.

31,1cz7o81,AITA for not waiting to make my wife happy,"AITA for not wanting to move into a new house?

So me and my fiancé talked about moving previously. We both own our own homes and my house is a new construction that was build during Covid so it’s got an interest rate under 3% and the P&I is less than $1400 for a 2700sq ft house. Her house is about 1400sq ft and she refinanced it during Covid to make it affordable but it’s less than 200K that she owes on the house. 

Well last year we spoke about it where I didn’t want to move due to even selling her house it was going to be cheaper to live in my house than buying a new one along with the fact that expenses are going to increase even we are together and have kids in the future which I thing she has thought of but not to the fact of day care costs being expensive.

Her reasoning behind it was that we’re both getting married so let’s get something together that we can call our own not just one of us moving into the others. Plus her commute from my house which we had agreed to move into would be too far. Plus even I said even if we sell both of houses (which I would like to keep mine as a rental so even if it’s 500/month of cash flow that’s still something extra coming in) it’s still going to be more than what I pay for the P&I. that she said well we could downsize which I advised that it doesn’t make sense to do that even if she was unhappy before being laid off at her job. Under to the point where it was triggering her ptsd and she was having nightmares about her job and walking on egg shells at the office

Well we’re both living about to get married soon and she got laid off from her job which has switched  to be closer to my house but her original job was changing offices and was going to be even further away than anything she wanted to find along with the politics of the workplace. 

Well she got laid off like I said and brought up would I reconsider moving if she gets a job in downtown (I live about 40-45 min from center city in the next county) and I would consider it but I don’t want to move 

So am I the asshole for not considering moving even though we might be worse financially but mentally she’ll be happier because it’s closer to her new job that she gets whenever?

The moment my best friend called me I was on the next flight out. My best friend mom was like my mom. I had a rough childhood growing up and both parents were never around. However my best friends mother side of the family hated me. I honestly never knew the reason. They constantly told her I was just another mouth to feed and it broke me. However she still always made sure I had enough in life. She went to all my big moments in life. My best friend and I were an unstoppable duo.

AITA for saying that we should wait twenty minutes before going to Costco?

Main body is a repost:

Am I Wrong for going to the car?

Today I (28F) got home around 6 after driving for an hour from work. I was greeted by my BF (27M) and he was in a good mood after taking a nap because he home all day. I changed into an indoor dress, sat down, and handed him the food I brought home. After talking for a minute or two he says he wanted to go to Costco and walk around and look for coconut water because he couldn’t find it yesterday. He also wanted to enjoy the nice weather because he felt stir crazy indoors. 

This is where it goes wrong.

I have absolutely no desire to go to Costco. He loves Costco. With a passion. For years now, the moment I get off of work, he insists that we go walk around a grocery store which is fine occasionally but man I freaking hate it. The last thing I want to do is go walk around a freezer section without any list or intent and then spend loads of money. He’s literally robbed the joy of grocery shopping from me. 

Despite this  hate in my soul, I say to myself “he loves Costco and knows that I hate going after work. Why don’t I propose a compromise!” So I suggest that we wait twenty minutes because I just got home and then we go.

Chaos ensues!

Apparently this wasn’t a compromise because it would be “just twenty minutes and then another twenty minutes and then 25 mins to get ready and then by that time the sun is gone.” 

Upon hearing this I said “Well then let’s just go now.” Bad idea. Now he doesn’t want to go because the wind was taken out of his sails. 

I again do wrong by pointing out that he got himself into a tizzy and that has nothing to do with me because I’m trying to listen and be responsive. Apparently this was wrong as well because I’m ‘escaping responsibility.’ 

I then say “I’m just trying to listen to you. Before I said that I wanted to wait [twenty mins and then go but after hearing your reasons it’s clear you want to go now so lets go]” but I was interrupted before finishing that statement by him saying “You’re trying to wait. You should have said ‘I was saying X earlier but I’m saying Y now.’” And then I said that I was going to say those exact words but he interrupted me. That only made him more upset and he said that I’m trying to play the victim. 

After all this I just decided to go to the car and wait for him to get dressed. Now he doesn’t want to go at all and I’m the bad guy. It’s been an hour and he’s still pouting.

Am I being an ass or is this just irrational behavior by him?

ADDENDUM:

On the one hand I understand his plight after being home all day. On the other hand I think he needs to be more self aware and realize this isn’t the big deal he made it into.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for saying we should wait to go to Costco Repost bc admin rules:

36,1czy8b5,AITA for wanting my mom’s engagement ring back?,"My mom passed away when I was six years old, and my dad buried her with their 2nd wedding band on, and kept the engagement ring and the original wedding band (they got new ones as an anniversary gift for each other 10 years in). 

My entire upbringing he always told me when someone wanted to propose to me, he would give them her engagement ring for them to propose with, and growing up it was literally always my dream to be proposed to with that ring. 

Around 4 years ago, my brother’s girlfriend’s (who is an immigrant from Japan) student visa was going to expire so the only real way that she could get a green card quickly was if they got married. My brother was a college student at the time and pretty broke, so it wasn’t like he could afford an engagement ring. My dad ended up giving my brother the ring to propose with since there wasn’t time for another solution, which really really upset me.  The engagement ring didn’t fit her at all, they mentioned they would get it resized (it fits me like a glove). 

I don’t see my brother often, but he just moved to my state so I’ve been seeing him more, and I’ve noticed she doesn’t wear the engagement ring, they wear bands they got each other that are on the cheaper side- not gold or silver or metal at all, they’re like dark blue with a really cool design. I’m not mentioning that to shame the rings at all! They fit their personalities and are some of the coolest wedding bands I’ve ever seen. I only mention it to compare the bands to the engagement ring. 

They never ended up getting it resized and it wasn’t her style really, so she just never wears it and it sits in a box somewhere collecting dust since she has no sentimental attachment to it and it always will. 

I’m now in a long term relationship and we’ve discussed getting engaged in about a year. I adore my boyfriend and I know it makes him sad that he can’t propose to me with her ring, too, knowing how much it and my mother means to me. I worry that he thinks it will ruin his proposal if he can’t with that ring and I don’t want that in his head or this to affect our relationship. Of course I would say yes even if he proposed to me with a stick he found on the ground lol, but that’s besides the point- it does break my heart a bit to think that I won’t get to be proposed to with my mom’s ring like how I wanted since I was a little girl. 

I completely understand the circumstances and that it wasn’t their fault (not mad with my brother or sister-in-law AT ALL, love them lol) but AITA to be mad that my dad gave it to my brother in the first place when it was supposed to be mine? My dad thinks I’m selfish and overreacting and we’ve argued several times about it because he refuses to admit that I have a right to be upset about it since we can’t change it. 

The title is a little off because I know there’s no real way of getting it back, but I wasn’t sure how else to put it.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for wanting my mom’s engagement ring back?

38,1czxy96,AITA for telling my 12 year old niece that the “looking for a man in finance” song is totally inappropriate for she and her friends and I don’t want to hear it in my presence?,"Obviously by now everyone has heard the “I’m looking for a man in finance, trust fund…” song and it’s million remixes. I’m not a stick in the mud, I know it’s supposed to be fun and not to be taken seriously. But it bothers me for the exact reasons that I’m about to type out.

I’m watching my niece while her parents are away for the holiday weekend. Today she asked if she could have two friends over to hand out. Of course I said yes. In the living room they were singing and dancing and just being silly kids. Then they started playing the song in question and they got really into it. And then they played it on repeat over and over again. I could take it anymore so I asked them to stop and questioned on if they understood the meaning of the song. One of the friends said it was just fun but my niece said it’s about getting a “hot guy to pay my bills so I can be hot and shop all the time.” I asked her if her mom (my sister, a MBA HR national manager overseeing 15000 people) would approve. she said her mom wasn’t here so I should relax. I said that was her attitude her friends can go home and she can go to her room. She got all huffy with me and said I was being stupid. I said being stupid is thinking a man should take care of her and that song is inappropriate and forbidden while in the house.


Apparently she texted my sister who called me and said I needed to relax and that her 12 year old daughter is dancing and having fun, and if there was real concern about her being a trad wife she wouldn’t have find out of town. I told her that 18 is coming and if she keeps being influenced by this trash, there might be real problems. She said I was being an “asshole judging a 12 year old girl who doesn’t even know what a man in finance is…relax.” I said maybe I shouldn’t be the watching her and and side that was fine, our mom could come over.

41,1czx4jk,AITA for snapping at my mom when she told me to toughen up?,"I am a 19yo female to male, and I have not surgically transitioned, so I do experience menstrual cycles. Please use he/him with me when possible.

I experience horrible menstrual pain when on my period, to the point of where there is a high likelihood I could collapse from pain. I’ve told my doctor about this, though my mom (47F) doesn’t believe me when I tell her something’s wrong.

This has been a constant ever since primary school and if I *am* ever actually ill or in pain, I would need physical proof for her to believe me. Mind you, I was a brutally honest child.

Fast forward a few years when I get my periods, and I’m collapsing *in* high school over the amount of pain I’d be in for that one week and I was nauseous to the point I’d be unable to eat half of what I needed to; this led to a plethora of other issues I won’t explain here, but they’d left me rather weak for my age. When the cramps happen, that weakness piled on top of the pain often leaves me bed bound.

My dad’s never questioned this, he’s my supervisor and gives me time off when my pain gets bad and sympathizes, but my mom isn’t the same. She says that I need to learn how to deal with the pain and just go to work because it’s not acceptable to take time off for that.

A few weeks ago, I was sick and tired of hearing her compare my pain to hers, saying that she would always go to work on her period and that I wasn’t any different, and I was just being lazy.

After she was done yelling at me, I snapped at her, and told her that she’s not me and doesn’t have a say in how much pain I’m in and how that pain affects me. She says that if I had the energy to fight with her (from my bed with a heat pad on and a bottle of pain meds next to me) that I had the energy to get up and go to work.

I ended the conversation there, in too much pain to argue with her and I asked her to leave my room politely. She did, though she wasn’t too happy with me for that because my reason was that I had a horrible migraine, which she also didn’t think I had, but she left with little argument.

AITA for snapping at her like that?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for snapping at my mom when she told me to toughen up? I am a 19yo female to male, and I have not surgically transitioned, so I do experience menstrual cycles. Please use he/him with me when possible.

I experience horrible menstrual pain when on my period, to the point of where there is a high likelihood I could collapse from pain. I’ve told my doctor about this, though my mom (47F) doesn’t believe me when I tell her something’s wrong.

This has been a constant ever since primary school and if I *am* ever actually ill or in pain, I would need physical proof for her to believe me. Mind you, I was a brutally honest child.

Fast forward a few years when I get my periods, and I’m collapsing *in* high school over the amount of pain I’d be in for that one week and I was nauseous to the point I’d be unable to eat half of what I needed to; this led to a plethora of other issues I won’t explain here, but they’d left me rather weak for my age. When the cramps happen, that weakness piled on top of the pain often leaves me bed bound.

My dad’s never questioned this, he’s my supervisor and gives me time off when my pain gets bad and sympathizes, but my mom isn’t the same. She says that I need to learn how to deal with the pain and just go to work because it’s not acceptable to take time off for that.

A few weeks ago, I was sick and tired of hearing her compare my pain to hers, saying that she would always go to work on her period and that I wasn’t any different, and I was just being lazy.

After she was done yelling at me, I snapped at her, and told her that she’s not me and doesn’t have a say in how much pain I’m in and how that pain affects me. She says that if I had the energy to fight with her (from my bed with a heat pad on and a bottle of pain meds next to me) that I had the energy to get up and go to work.

I ended the conversation there, in too much pain to argue with her and I asked her to leave my room politely. She did, though she wasn’t too happy with me for that because my reason was that I had a horrible migraine, which she also didn’t think I had, but she left with little argument.

43,1czwzo4,AITA for “breaking” my vegan diet?,"Edit: I am a guy

Hi people, 

My entire family are vegans, my dad especially is a very “vocal” vegan. He goes to vegan protests, was in vegan groups in our old city, he’s a vegan activist. Which I love, I’m not trying to paint those things as bad I really respect him for his thoughts. 

My brother and I have both been raised vegan our entire lives. At school it’s always made me feel “othered” is the best way to explain it. Never able to eat anything sold in the school canteen, at friend’s birthdays never able to eat a piece of cake with my friends, or have to be the one who says “we can’t go to that restaurant they don’t serve any vegan food”. Always having to explain why I’m not allowed to “try a bite” of their sandwich. They aren’t huge things but they are things that make me stick out. Since I’m an awkward guy anyway, it just doesn’t help me socially. So when we moved cities and I joined a new school last Monday I decided that I’m not going to follow the vegan diet while I’m at school. I kept this to myself because I know my parents wouldn’t support it and would be angry. 

When at home, or with my parents I will follow the vegan diet but if I’m out with my friends or at school I’m not going to say, in my mind this was respectful of my parents wishes. No meat in the house or around them but my myself is different. My brother and I both go to this new school. Since we don’t share a dinner time I didn’t tell him that I wasn’t going to follow the vegan diet, I didn’t think he would support it and I thought he would tell dad. 

Things have been going alright but I didn’t know that on Fridays my brother’s dinner time would be at the same time as mine. I was sitting with some new friend and I was eating a cheese pizza (this is the only non-vegan food I’ve eaten so far. I want to try pepperoni but still feel a little scared) and my brother caught me and asked what I was doing eating pizza. 

I tried to play it off but I knew I was screwed, my brother told my parents and now everyone is really upset at me. I’ve been grounded and my dad said he’s going to call my new school and tell them that if they sell me non-vegan food he will put in a discrimination complaint. Which is just going to make me seem like a weirdo now. 

I tried to explain to him that I was trying to be respectful by not doing it here, but my parents just gave me a huge lecture about how I’m so selfish for breaking the diet. He said he can’t trust me anymore and now I feel guilty in one half of my brain and in another I’m telling myself it isn’t that big of a deal and they’re overreacting. 

But I don’t know if I’m just being blind. 

Please, no debates about the ethics of the vegan diet. I don’t care to debate it with anyone I’m sure there are subreddits where people will be happy to. Please focus on my situation when giving your verdict.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for “breaking” my vegan diet? Edit: I am a guy

44,1czwz9o,AITA for going the speed limit in a parking garage when a person is around?,"I had an altercation with a neighbor of mine just now as I was getting home from the gym. As I was pulling into our garage, I saw my neighbor unloading his car and I checked my speed to make sure I was going the speed limit, which I was at 10mph. I gave him some space and I pulled into my parking spot. My best guess is that it was 3-4 feet of space between where he was standing and my car. As I was unloading my car, I heard him say ""Excuse me"" and the following conversation occurred:

Me: Yeah what's up?

Neighbor: Would you mind slowing down when driving through the garage?
(I sensed some attitude coming from him and felt like I was being accused of doing something wrong, which made me a little defensive. The whole conversation was somewhat tense)

Me: I was only going 10mph.

Neighbor: I could have tripped and got injured.

Me: I mean okay, I guess I'll be more mindful.

As I was walking away, I saw the 10mph speed limit sign posted so I pointed at it and said: By the way, the speed limit here says 10mph.

Neighbor: I'm glad I don't have a dog or anything.

Me: Okay goodbye.

A couple of years ago our whole apartment complex got an email from the property manager asking for everyone to obey the posted speed limit, and I try to be mindful of that every time I come or go from our garage. We also have a lot of families with kids and pets in the building which I always try to be on the lookout for as well, but I feel it's okay to go the posted speed limit as long as I am being alert, but should I instead slow down?

She had told me that she would pay for them, pay for their cages, pay for their food, ect. I had told her that I was okay with it, as long as she could find the space with natural light. 

She is in online school full time, so she is home all the time. I work a lot and not home often. She had told me that she wanted them because it would help her with feeling lonely at home while I'm at work.

A month ago, her mom had called her telling her that she found the ""perfect guinea"" for her, she grabbed her things and met her mom at the pet store. She then came back home with all the pet supplies along with a guinea pig. She apologized, and reminded me of what the deal was, and that I had agreed to it. My standing didn't change on it. 

However, after a couple weeks, she had been buying food, toys, pads, ect. She asked for me to pay half of the bill, and told me that the guinea pig was for us and not only her. I was irritated, but reminded her what she had said when asking me if it was okay to get one.

Fast forward to last weekend, she wanted to get a second guinea pig because they need to come in pairs, as they are a social animal, ""human attention is not a substitute"". The night before she was frustrated with her financial status because she is a student. I sent her money for half of her second guinea pig because I felt bad and knew that it would help her, and her guinea pig out.

My GF is now asking me to pay for half of all the pet stuff moving forward. Because I helped her pay for her second guinea pig, so technically it's ""half mine""???
 
I reminded her again about what she had said when asking to get them. I also asked her ""Why did you get them if you aren't willing to pay for their needs?"".

I also told her ""I paid for half of it to help you, and your current guinea pigs mental health out. I was being nice."" I didn't want her not to get it because she didn't want to pay the full $50 (or whatever the price is for one) and then her current guinea pig continues to be stressed, and depressed because it's alone.

I fostered Cats and Dogs throughout COVID, I told her that I have no problems going to the pet store and buying food once in awhile if she can't, I am not inhumane.

The pandemic delayed the show and had since broken up with my boyfriend at the time. Instead, I gave the ticket to and took my best friend for his birthday. 

We are travel and show buddies. Fast forward a bit and since then, we went to the uk with some friends, and next is Beyoncé’s renaissance tour. We do our best to get tickets the day they dropped and he got the best tickets possible on her birthday show. He surprised me by insisting I don’t pay him for my ticket as a gesture from when I gave him the chromatica ticket and as my birthday present. 

A few months after the tickets were purchased I started seriously seeing someone. During our dating time, we’d been going on road trips and seeing shows. I came to learn you can just show up the day of a concert and get amazing tickets at a low price. I took a gamble during a Vegas trip with my boyfriend and tried to see Beyoncé’s renaissance tour when she was coincidentally there. I was able to get two general admission tickets for 600.00. We were  AT the stage, it was amazing. 

I let my best friend know and graciously offered to let him sell the tickets or take someone else. He wasn’t forwardly rude about it, but he expressed his disappointment and said the tickets were meant to be a gift. It was also an event for us to hangout at because our friendship has been traveling and shows. We don’t live close together so we make plans like these to hangout. Things seemed ok from here, at least to me. 

We went to the show together but things haven’t been the same. When we last spoke about Beyoncé or her movie, he asked if I’d seen it. I said “no” and he replied “I’d get you tickets for it, but you’d probably find a better theater with softer seats yourself.” And seems to be passive aggressive about it when it comes up. 

Recently I brought up the experience while chatting with him on the phone and we went from having a nice chat to him exploding. He said me doing that has stained our friendship. He said seeing the show isn’t a big deal, but it insulted him for me to offer to pass on the tickets and the suggestion o sell them or take someone else. It made his gift feel like a joke and because I make more money than him and my living situation is very cheap, I didn’t consider how difficult it is for him to plan and buy 1000.00 tickets than it is for me. To him, it’s some grand gesture.

Now today, Friday after a super exciting week at the university, I just wanted to relax and watch my favorite series, which I fell asleep watching, I woke up to a message from the mother of a friend of my little brother that the school activity was canceled and If we are going to go get him, because it is already late, I asked my brother (18yr M) to let him know what had happened and his response was, ""no, he is asleep"" I got angry because it is not the first time that I ask him to help me with something about our brother and he says no.

49,1czvuux,AITA because I left my friend on vacation because he snores?,"So for context, I took my friend on a one day vacation to Universal Studios and we were going to leave the next day around 2pm. However, I have never known him to snore as loudly as he did that night.

That night, he was snoring extremely loud, occasionally passing gas, and had the air conditioner on so cold that I couldn’t handle it. He even at one point told me to just bundle up.

None of this made me mad btw. In fact, I wasn’t mad at all, I just couldn’t mentally handle his snoring so I got up and told him around 5am that I was going to take another flight. I’m pretty sure that he felt terrible about it, considering I left him alone, even though though he didn’t say he did when I left, but sure enough he’s blocked me. 

Also one thing that stuck out was that his snoring got muffled in his sleep occasionally. I’m pretty sure he has sleep apnea. I told him before I left and he ignored me and I also texted that to him before he blocked me that it was a serious condition and he needs to see a doctor, so now I’m also wondering if he thinks I am an asshole for not only leaving him, but also leaving him and notifying him of that... Anyways, AITA?

I'm a university student and work a part time job at a dining hall on campus to aid with paying off tuition. ive worked for about 5 months now, and the pay isn’t great but it’s easy and recently it has been getting better now that im more well acquainted with my coworkers.



one of my student managers, however, has begun making potentially flirtatious remarks about me after i came out as bisexual. it started as normal gossipy conversation about his exes and stuff which is always a bit fun, though each time we’ve interacted i’ve been a little closed off since i wasnt fully comfortable with those kinds of topics.



one time he made a remark about bisexual guys not being “bisexual” enough. even though i dont feel the need to validate my bisexuality, i have been with guys in the past, but am currently in a very committed long term relationship with a girl. i didnt feel the need to disclose this information with him, since hes just a coworker anyway, but recently he started making more outwardly flirtatious comments, such as asking about my type in guys, saying my mannerisms are “hot” or “adorable,” and most recently, asking if i was a top or bottom. 



i feel really shitty and tried removing him as an instagram follower, but i feel ive made the situation worse. i also feel like a bad boyfriend for not straight up telling him i had a girlfriend, but i didnt think it was really his business anyway (plus its pretty clear thats the case on my instagram). i feel like ive been leading him on this whole time by not shutting him down.  im not sure what to do, because earlier at work today he asked to hang out with me outside of work, and i couldnt straight up reject him because, despite us being the same age, hes technically my manager and i didnt want to ruin our “professional” relationship. am i the asshole for being so passive and potentially leading him on, and also doing my girlfriend a disservice by not telling him that we’re together?

51,1czvr9l,AITA for not letting my mother in law give my daughter an expensive piece of jewelry for her3rd birthday? ,"My (27F) daughter turned three last month and my mother-in-law (72F) was planning to give her an expensive necklace that had been in her family for almost 100years. According to her, it belongs to my daughter because it was always given to the first daughter of the first-born son, and honestly I don't like the idea that only one of my daughters has something valuable and the other doesn't (we have a twomonth old daughter too) So I told my mother in law that I appreciated her intention but that I didn't want to continue with the tradition knowing that in the future it could lead to fights between my daughters, and of course she was offended.

My husband (49M) said that I should have accepted the gift, that in the future we could buy a similar necklace for our other daughter, but I told him that it is not the same for me and that I did not want the necklace.  That our 3 year old daughter would be happier with a 10 dollar doll than with a necklace that is probably worth about 15,000 necklace that by the way she will not be able to wear until she's at least 18 years old.

Long story short, my husband understood but the rest of his family thinks I was rude to reject a gift with so much sentimental value, but I don't think that's the case. I mean, if they had told me that the necklace was for all the girls I would have accepted it, but they have this stupid rule that it only belongs to the firstborn daughter and that she can't give it to anyone else. And they put a lot of emphasis on that and that's what bothers me the most because they act like my oldest daughter is some kind of saint and they rarely pays attention to my youngest daughter.

I am friendly with my work friends and the worker who caused the drama but there is friction because of that initial incident and ensuing events.

Yesterday the coworker (Fran) who publically apologized for her boyfriend (Stan)mentioned that her and several other coworkers were going to trivia night for the upcoming saturday. I said that I'd like to go, I'll just have to see. She mentioned that her boyfriend (Stan)  wasn't going to be there because of his actions the last time we tried interacting together. The incident the last time was that he mistook me using my glucose monitor as an aid to cheat in scrabble and snarkily called me out. Stan apologized and we smoothed it over. (he also posted on AITA) Fran also publically apologized on behalf of Stan but it was in front of customers.

After Fran mentioned that Stan wasn't going to be there I said something along the lines of ""I'll be fine without going then. I don't want to be the cause of another fight between you two."" Fran said it was fine then and left the break room.

An hour later as I was talking with another coworker in the break room the coworker mentioned that Fran was saying something about me being so fixated on her mistake when Stan was the one who made me feel uncomfortable in the first place. I was confused and tried asking for clarification and the coworker said that Fran was mad that STan's initial apology (where after the scrabble game he talked to me privately and we smoothed things over) went over better than her apology (where she loudly apologized in front of customers in the salon with a gift card she and Stan gave me from Kroger, revealing that I had diabetes in several regulars). I said ""Well that confirms that I won't hang out with Fran anymore becuase she's centering herself"" Turns out Fran overheard that portion of the conversation and is now frosty towards me.

I asked him how much he thought they would have to pay in monthly expenses if they were not living with me which started another argument.  We live in NM and the average monthly cost of a one bedroom apartment is over $800 not including utilities if you want to live in a better part of town.

Hi everyone,

I (25F) am a mother to Paul* (6M) who has been facing some academic and social challenges at school. His father, who hasn’t been consistently involved in his life, recently started to reconnect and wanted to attend an important school meeting. When he showed up, he was wearing a durag. I asked him to take it off, explaining that it wasn’t appropriate for such a formal setting. He took offense, insulted me, left the meeting, and then blocked me on everything a while continuing to insult me.

My friends think I was unreasonable for asking him to remove his durag. So,AITA here?

About 4 months or so ago I had hugged her bf because I was in tear and him, being a good friend asked if I needed a hug, I said I could use one and we hugged. As  friends. Nothing more right? Well according to his gf that's wrong. She yelled at me for about 10 minutes and then asked me to not hug her bf anymore. I apologized and said okay and I've respected  that. She has said I can high five him or fist bump him but doesn't want me hugging him which seems reasonable and I've respected that and we've only highfived each other or given each other a fist bump. Recently shes been getting mad at me for that too, so she asked me or not touch him anymore in general at all, and I said okay sure I can do that. And then about a week after that she got mad because I was sitting at the table with him and my other friends and the only seat left was the one next to him.

Although I still have people pleasing tendencies, I have grown so much after leaving my family home. One thing that I have done in romantic relationships is deny my wants/desires as to not come off as needy to the other person. I figured, the less I ask for, the more desirable I will be. So I told all of my boyfriends that I didn't want flowers or anything because it's a waste of money.

Of course, most girls like flowers, or at least some sort of romantic gesture to make them feel loved and wanted and thought of. I denied wanting this in order to appear low maintenance because I thought that's what men want.

Anyway, I said the same thing to my husband when we first got together. We didn't have a lot of money, and I didn't want him to feel like he needed to spend anything on me. Of course he did a few times during the courting period, but then it dropped off. The last thing he bought me that I didn't ask for and wasn't expecting was a sapphire necklace to match my engagement ring. That was back in 2017 after our first kid was born. 

We have money now. I am also way less of a people pleaser and have realized that yes, I do want surprises/romantic gestures once in a while. I have talked to him about it in a nonconfrontational way.

I told my husband I was so sad that I thought they were from him but I had to find out from our kid that they weren't. I asked him again to buy me flowers.

A few days ago, he got me a 200$ pre-paid visa with a note that basically said I could go get whatever I wanted. I was crushed again, and I explained to him that I want a romantic gesture, not a prepaid card to do my own shopping with.

I’m obese, nearly morbidly obese according to the internet.

She’s made fun of my weight before, but she always says it’s just a joke. 

She constantly asks everyone in her friend group if she’s fat, I understand being insecure but it’s genuinely really excess and it’s weekly while we’re eating lunch at this point. She never eats her lunch and always throws it away, then points to mine and tells me that im eating so much and that even half of that would fill her up. She’s said this everyday for the past 3 or 4 months. I don’t think she’s on a diet or anything either she just makes weird comments like that a lot.

Today she asked to try my jacket on because she was cold, I thought she was actually cold but after she said “oh my god this is so huge on me … does this actually fit you” obviously im paraphrasing i don’t remember exactly, but my other friends started to laugh. I told her that she does look fat, and she looks fatter than me. And that my jacket fits her really well. 

She got quiet and changed the subject, but tonight she messaged me and asked me why I would say that when I know she’s insecure.

62,1cztr5t,AITA for not letting my mom babysit our daughter?,"I need an outsiders position on this. Give it to me straight.  

My wife (32F) and I (35M) have a nearly 2yo daughter. My wife is staying home with her but is going back to work soon. I mentioned it to my (retired) mom (68F) and she was very insistent on babysitting for us.  

My wife is a superhuman. I did not know mothers like this existed until I saw her with my daughter. She never raises her voice, she's unbelievably patient, she always knows what to do and she's just so loving. She cooks each of our daughters meals from scratch and even makes healthy ice cream for the whole family. They spend multiple hours a day every day in nature regardless of weather. She doesn't use screens - she's that dedicated. I couldn't think of anything our daughter would need that my wife hasn't thought about and bought 3 months ago. She is the best and I sincerely don't know how she does it. Naturally, her expectations for childcare are very high. Good thing is we can afford it.  

I mentioned to my wife that my mom insisted on babysitting for us when she returns to work. She laughed and said 'yes, I can imagine that. Our daughter eating frozen pizza in front of a TV while your mom talks to her girlfriends on the phone, smoking inside, occasionally yelling at our daughter for age appropriate behaviour. And when we come back she swears upon god she did not smoke here, tells daughter was naughty and we must spank her or she'll grow up to be a prostitute'. I laughed too and never mentioned it to my wife again.  

Now, my wife did exaggerate but she's not wrong. My mom is like that. The 'children must be seen but not heard' type. She also tells what she calls 'white lies' very often, basically refusing to admit she did something she was told not to do. Because she does what she wants and believes she's always right. So I realise her watching our daughter is not really an option, especially because our daughter does not like my mom at all.  

Some time after our initial conversation, I was talking to my mom on the phone. She asked about wife's plans regarding work and I eventually told her we're already interviewing nannies. Long story short, I had to tell her that we don't think her babysitting our daughter is a good idea and is not happening. She was very offended by the fact that we'd 'rather trust a stranger than her'. She cried and I felt bad (apparently not bad enough to change my mind as I still think what she wants is not in my family's best interest).  

I do feel bad about this whole situation but I must also say my parents are welcome to visit and interact with their granddaughter. I'm not preventing them from being in her life.  

However, my mom is giving me silent treatment and my dad called me worse than an asshole. Apparently, mom is really hurt as she already told everyone she would be having her granddaughter over every day. I must say I never agreed to it and she never even mentioned wanting to watch her in their home, which is an automatic no since they smoke inside.

Jane tends to get herself into tough situations and then asks for help to get out. She buys things she can't afford, can’t keep her house clean, do her own taxes. She is very emotionally dependent on me.
Her baby daddy, let's call him Richard (Dick for short), is a man child. He never seemed to grow up and would leave Jane and Sam anytime he and Jane had a fight. He was very neglectful of Sam.

I have my own physical and mental health issues. But I keep getting asked to come over to hang out, pick Sam up from daycare, give advice, and help clean her house (no matter how often I help, it gets dirty again, think borderline hoarder). I can’t do it anymore. I’m exhausted.
I was going to take a break from our friendship because when I've set boundaries in the past, they weren't respected, she never listened to my advice, needed more and more from me, and I just couldn’t watch it happen anymore. But I couldn’t bring myself to do it. We were talking, and I felt like I had my best friend back. I had a short conversation with her where I stated I needed space, and if there was an emergency, then I could help with Sam. She was nice about it, and it felt like our friendship was back to normal.
But now, a week later, she’s back to asking me to pick Sam up daily because she had to work late. I am the first person she reaches out to instead of Dick or her other family member. Sam stays with her full-time, but Dick watches her a few days a week. I have told her no and made excuses, which were partially true, but now she’s back to not respecting my boundaries.
I feel like I’m being an AH because I’m not helping her. My bf has told me that I need to focus on myself, but I feel like his opinion might be biased because he doesn’t like Jane and thinks she takes advantage of me.

65,1czt7iv,AITA for telling my Best Friend not to take back her manipulative Ex?,"Just a heads up this is my first post.

I (F 17) have been best friends with Alex (F 18) for around a year and a half now after meeting online. When I met her she had a bf, Dan (M 19) who I didn’t really know but just knew existed. Around summertime of last year he cheated on her and they broke up (after having already broken up and gotten back together for various reasons multiple times in the past) I knew what happened and I was of course, there for her when she needed me about it. A couple months later, you guessed it, Dan comes back into her life. This continues to happen MULTIPLE times before the end of the year, her getting hurt every single time. She’s told me many times that she wouldn’t take him back again and anytime he does come back that they’re “just friends” but it always goes south. Dan is the type who will literally just use girls and then dump them when he’s finished, going through many girls. Alex knows this but still is so extremely attached to him that she’s miserable without him. Now onto the current issue, for most of this year so far Alex has been “clean” and hasn’t had too many run ins with Dan, as well as not dating him.

Advice?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for telling my Best Friend not to take back her manipulative Ex? Just a heads up this is my first post.

I (F 17) have been best friends with Alex (F 18) for around a year and a half now after meeting online. When I met her she had a bf, Dan (M 19) who I didn’t really know but just knew existed. Around summertime of last year he cheated on her and they broke up (after having already broken up and gotten back together for various reasons multiple times in the past) I knew what happened and I was of course, there for her when she needed me about it. A couple months later, you guessed it, Dan comes back into her life. This continues to happen MULTIPLE times before the end of the year, her getting hurt every single time. She’s told me many times that she wouldn’t take him back again and anytime he does come back that they’re “just friends” but it always goes south. Dan is the type who will literally just use girls and then dump them when he’s finished, going through many girls. Alex knows this but still is so extremely attached to him that she’s miserable without him. Now onto the current issue, for most of this year so far Alex has been “clean” and hasn’t had too many run ins with Dan, as well as not dating him. She has however, made many alt accounts on social media to see what he’s up to, etc. (As she’s usually blocked until he wants her back again) Because of this, she (and I through her) know that he’s been messaging a girl Lilly (F 16) he’s 19.

66,1czt3yj,AITA for avoiding a ‘new friend’?,"I used to work as a photographer (I recently quit) and a couple of months ago a guy got in touch with me over instagram who I’d seen play at a local open mic a few times. I liked his music and we got chatting, we seemed to hit it off well and I offered him a photoshoot for his music which he happily agreed to.

A couple of weeks go by chatting semi-regularly on instagram before we meet to take photos and we are getting on, sharing ideas of how we want the photos to look. He’s pretty chatty and so am I, though as it gets closer to the shoot day I start feeling kinda weird and I cannot explain why. The morning he’s meant to pick me up I’m feeling so weird I contemplate cancelling but because I can’t explain it, I go ahead and the shoot goes well. We chat a lot and have fun. The conversation gets pretty deep and he talks about several exes including his most recent abusive ‘stalker ex’. I empathise because I’d been through something similar a few years ago.

Skip ahead and I send him his photos and he pays me - he likes the photos but suggests we meet up for another photoshoot. We end up meeting 2 other times to do another one with him and one with him and our mutual friend. It all goes well, but when I’m meant to be meeting him alone I feel super uncomfortable for seemingly no reason again and want to cancel, but don’t.

More weeks go by and I’m about to go away to travel alone for a while, but our talking had gotten so much to the point where he’d be messaging me every day, frequently talking about his problems with his ex and other pains in his life, he mentions things his ex has said like him being ‘controlling’ and ‘narcissistic’, I tell him I’m sorry she said those things and honestly don’t think much of it. We meet up to hang out before I go away and see his ex as we are walking, so we turn around and talk about her for the rest of the time.

When I go away I say I want to use my phone less but I’d be happy to exchange emails to keep in touch. We do and it seems fine. When I come home we text again and this is where things start getting weird - he says “when you went away and we stopped texting that really fucked with me”. I feel bad but said I told him I wouldn’t be able to text and we were still emailing.

A few weeks go by and we text but he starts getting weird, shutting down the conversation when it’s stuff that isn’t “interesting” to him or about him and his interests. He seems completely different. Before I travelled he’d frequently say I inspire him and honestly seemed kinda overbearing with compliments, but now the complete opposite. Conversations dry up and he stops asking me how I am, but keeps asking to meet up. 

We were meant to meet this weekend again but I got that overwhelming uncomfortable feeling again so I cancelled. I want to cut him off but I feel like an asshole because I don’t have a “real reason”.

My parents have been separated since 2020, however, since 2014-2015 their relationship was rocky due to him leaving us to go and work in another city (without even letting us know) when my mum was pregnant with my younger brother which was hard for all of us. In 2020 he suddenly asked for a divorce out of nowhere claiming that my mum was ""too dominant"". After their divorce, I didn't really go over to his house as I hated him for the pain he caused our family. In their agreement, my dad agreed to not have custody over us if he was allowed to pay less child support so I rarely visisted him and cut our contact short. Fast forward to 2022 and my dad invites me over to his house and tells me that he has a girlfriend. I didn't care as I didn't go over to his place much anyway so it wouldn't change anything for me. Later I learned from my aunt (mum's sister) that he was getting married to her and that the woman was from the town my dad left us to work at. It was obvious that the main reason for divorce wasn't that my mum was a dominant person and my dad was just cheating on her. For months I acted like I didn't know the news about the marriage so my dad could tell me. He finally told me he would get married in like five months, turns out that was also a lie as he got married two days after speaking to me. I was tired of his lies so I cut all contact with him.

The other day I turned 18. We planned to open a debit card in my name for him to send money to. (Where I live people who turn 18 don't typically get jobs if they are attending uni and our parents support us through university so it wasn't a weird request.) We wanted the card to be in my name as I did not want him to be able to track my history which I knew he would attempt to do as he did similar things in the past. My brother (who keeps in touch with him) told me that my dad opened a supplementary card for me without even asking. I was honestly pissed off as it had been a year since we had last talked.

So today my mum told my dad to pay half of my school expenses (it is in their agreement) and my dad started asking to see the receipts and told her he would only pay if I create an account in my name he can send the money to. I was already going out so I went to the bank to create it myself. While I was there I applied for a card and saw the credit card he had opened for me under my ID. Here is where I might be an asshole. I didn't want him to know anything about me, so I asked the banker if I could cancel the card. When I got home from the bank my mum showed me texts from my dad threatening my mum to ""fix this"" and to not mess with him. I know my dad gets scary when mad so I don't know if I put my mum in a dangerous position. I don't think he can do much anyway as it was cancelled by me personally but I still can't stop wondering if I am the AH. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for cancelling the credit card my deadbeat father created for me?

68,1czsxct,AITA for telling my sister it’s not my fault her husband is toxic?,"I (21f) and my sister (26f) have had a love hate relationship like all siblings since we were little. My sister was my parents golden child, valedictorian of her hs, a state champion in various sports, nice to everyone, etc. because of family issues she couldn’t go to a good uni and ended up going to a local one where she faced bullying and ended up depressed. Then Covid happened and she completely shut down.

During this time she started talking with the son of my dads friend. I was pretty close with him and knew about his troubled past relationships but I convinced her to keep talking to him cause me and my mom knew she wouldn’t find someone for herself any other way. She and him had a few fights when he told her that he was confused between her and an ex of his. My sister told him that she wasn’t interested in him if he wanted someone else and wasn’t sure about my sister, but I convinced her to give him a chance and convinced him to ask her out. He moved to another country but kept contact with my sister, during which they had countless fights but I would mediate and tell them to stick it out.

 They got married last year, and they have been fighting since then. He doesn’t talk to my sister properly, never treats her lovingly, and spends all of his time gaming. He didn’t let her spend any money in the name of savings and then sent all of their savings to his family back home and they have not gone on any vacations at all.

Now I’m getting engaged to a really nice guy who treats me wonderfully.

When I was younger I enjoyed homeschool a lot and I remember loving that I got to spend so much time with my dad. But I never really had any friends, I did go to Scouts but that was just for 1 hour a week and dad never lets anyone come over to our house or lets me go out with friends. So most of my friends are from Reddit and discord. 

I’ve approached my dad about me joining back with normal school but he doesn’t want me to. But I really want to, so I applied (Idk if that’s the right word) for the college in our town in secret and I was just going to go with the “ask for forgiveness, not permission” route with my dad and hope things worked out. 

Because I didn’t want my dad to find out my friend I made on discord told me to put down my address as his address (we live in the same town) so if they send any post my dad won’t see that I’ve applied. They sent out all these forms that need to be signed by my dad, but obviously he won’t sign them. My friend said that he will sign them pretending to be my dad for me. 

Though I want to go, I’m starting to feel nervous about the whole thing. I worried about if my dad goes mad at me for signing up. My dad will definitely be mad at me for doing it and he will be super mad if he knows I’ve got someone to fake sign the forms for him. 

My friend is encouraging me to do it anyway, but now I’m getting second thoughts and will just probably not do it because I’m worried about how my dad is going to react. I think probably this was all a stupid idea anyway because I don’t even know how I would get to college everyday. 

But on the other hand I really want to be normal and I don’t feel normal being homeschooled and stuck here all the time and my friend says if I do go we can finally meet up in person. He doesn’t go there but he said he can meet me up after the day or something.  So that makes me want to go it.

We were discussing the fact that the network had recently dropped an insurance company in its entirety, and the impact that was having on us as well as our patients because some of our patients were going to have to find new care. This led to a conversation about why we should have universal healthcare. My friend's brother is a part of our lunch group because we promised their dying mom. However, he is a difficult arrogant person. He was listening to The conversation and said it figured that I would think universal healthcare was a good idea. FYI, I'm the only POC in our group. He then went on to say that he didn't want to have to pay for shanaynay and shaniqua's mistakes. Several of My friends jumped his case for the clearly racist comment but I just laughed which pissed him off all the more. He asked what I thought was so funny and I just said the idea of you of all people subsidizing anyone's lives. I then proceeded to go off and remind him that he wasn't even paying for his own damn lunch today because he says he can't afford the places we go to and has done it so many times that we just have an unwritten rule where whoever picked a place pays for his lunch too. Then when it's his turn to pick he picks a exorbitantly expensive place and we end up splitting it. Not only that, but he refuses to take any of the prestigious teaching jobs he's been offered because he believes that those who can do and those who can't teach. The only reason he isn't homeless after no one in the area would rent to him anymore is that his brother took part of his half of the inheritance their mother left them and put a 35k deposit down on his house for him and the only reason his kids are in private school is because his mother was smart enough not to trust him with the money and put it in a trust for the girls that he couldn't touch. He's got 200K in student debt for his PhD and refuses to get an actual job in his field because then he'd have to start paying it back according to his agreement. So instead he works temp jobs at various places. He's got a SAH wife with a shopping addiction and a mountain of credit card debt to show for it, everyone at the table has helped him pay bills and the only reason one of his kids is getting the orthodontia she needs is because someone in my family agreed to do it free of cost because she was being bullied so severely. So for him to be worried about subsidizing anyone when realistically everyone was subsidizing him was hilarious. 

He got mad and said"" I don't need to listen to some tar baby porch monkey"" and stormed off. Our group is split.

However, he is a difficult arrogant person. He was listening to The conversation and said it figured that I would think universal healthcare was a good idea. FYI, I'm the only POC in our group. He then went on to say that he didn't want to have to pay for shanaynay and shaniqua's mistakes. Several of My friends jumped his case for the clearly racist comment but I just laughed which pissed him off all the more. He asked what I thought was so funny and I just said the idea of you of all people subsidizing anyone's lives. I then proceeded to go off and remind him that he wasn't even paying for his own damn lunch today because he says he can't afford the places we go to and has done it so many times that we just have an unwritten rule where whoever picked a place pays for his lunch too. Then when it's his turn to pick he picks a exorbitantly expensive place and we end up splitting it. Not only that, but he refuses to take any of the prestigious teaching jobs he's been offered because he believes that those who can do and those who can't teach. The only reason he isn't homeless after no one in the area would rent to him anymore is that his brother took part of his half of the inheritance their mother left them and put a 35k deposit down on his house for him and the only reason his kids are in private school is because his mother was smart enough not to trust him with the money and put it in a trust for the girls that he couldn't touch. He's got 200K in student debt for his PhD and refuses to get an actual job in his field because then he'd have to start paying it back according to his agreement. So instead he works temp jobs at various places. He's got a SAH wife with a shopping addiction and a mountain of credit card debt to show for it, everyone at the table has helped him pay bills and the only reason one of his kids is getting the orthodontia she needs is because someone in my family agreed to do it free of cost because she was being bullied so severely. So for him to be worried about subsidizing anyone when realistically everyone was subsidizing him was hilarious. 

He got mad and said"" I don't need to listen to some tar baby porch monkey"" and stormed off. Our group is split. Some of them think he kind of had it coming and the others think I was far too harsh and owe him an apology for just the level I took to",0.0,0.004449433647096157,0,1

I (17F) am questioning whether or not I should attend my mother's (38F) wedding due to various issues we have argued about. My mother recently began dating a man, let’s name him Mike, and although my mom claims they have been together for longer, they officially started dating in March, because that’s when she texted me he asked her to go steady. My biggest concern is that everything is moving too fast, as ‘Mike’ proposed to my mom without my knowledge on May 11th and they are now planning to get married this July. I feel uncomfortable with the situation because I hardly know Mike and my mother is not considering how this will affect me or my siblings. Also, in a previous conversation where i basically told my mom i would not give my blessing, she said that ‘Mike’ would not move in until after they got married, but he and his daughter(15F) have been staying at my house every night for the past month now.  I feel like I’m losing my mother's attention to ‘Mike’ and that our hard-fought and long awaited close relationship is slipping away. I of course feel guilty about not wanting to be involved in the wedding or attend it but because of everything that has happened i’m not so sure. So lmk, am i the asshole?

EDIT 1: my siblings are 13F and 8M and my sister has expressed her frustration with this but not my brother. my mom and ‘mike’ met each other through church just about a year ago and have been friends since august. my biggest red flags about ‘mike’ is that his previous marriage was bad(bc of his ex wife) and he fell to bad habits with drinking and such. he also had a bad run in with the cops with joyriding under the influence and is currently on parole and i feel my mom is being naive and turning a blind eye to the whole thing.

My dad, slightly drunk and slurring his words, was driving. I sat in the front passenger seat while my mom, who prefers the backseat due to back issues, was in the back. My parents argue daily, and I often tune ignore it.

While driving my dad brought up my mom's in-laws' loud motorcycles, which my dad criticized as ""stupid."" My mom defended them, explaining that they couldn't afford quieter bikes. This started an argument, with my dad accusing my mom of being a ""bitch"" and ""stupid"" for always siding with her family. My mom's family often relies on her for support, despite her siblings being employed and having their own families. My mom always helps them financially, they all rely on her. If something is broken in the house, it's abandoned unless mom buys another, which made my dad mad.
As my dad started speeding, increasing from his usual 40 km/h to 80 km/h. My mom was screaming at him to stop, and I was scared since the car swayed on the dark road. Despite being immensely scared, I stayed quiet because I was also scared of them because I used to be yelled at if I tried to stop them from fighting when I was younger. I was fully convinced I was going to die then and there and accepted it. As awful and selfish as it sounds, I don't know if it may be because I have depression, but I'm not diagnosed despite certain things I inflict to myself because my parents don't believe in mental disorders. 

My mom called my dad's sister, which calmed him down and he slowed to 40 km/h again. When we got home my dad left and said to me he was going to sleep at out other house.

I strongly believed that I shouldn't really intervene in their fights because it's THEIR fight. I was internally questioning why she even chose to have a child with him if way back when they were in college she knew he was an awful person, my mom had me a lot later in her life.

76,1czrvsg,AITA for agreeing that I look like my twin brother in front of my boyfriend?,"My (19M) boyfriend (20M) and my TWIN brother (19M) got into an argument yesterday and I can unfortunately say that my boyfriend was very much in the wrong. That's not the point tho. The point is after my brother proved him wrong my boyfriend got mad because both of my brothers started laughing at him and he told my brother to shut his ugly ass up. I didn't think much of it until my brother pointed out we had the same face and started laughing harder.

Then I just looked at my boyfriend and he started denying it saying that we don't look alike, etc and kept insisting my brother was uglier. We are IDENTICAL. I told my boyfriend that I know he probably said it just to insult him but that it's no reason to lie and deny that we look alike because we literally do. 

My boyfriend kinda got quiet after that and just apologized to all three of us and left not long after. After he left he called me and told me that let I hurt his feelings and should've stopped pointing out that my brother and I look alike. He told me that I could've just agreed with him because it's his opinion and we made him feel stupid about it. 

I told my boyfriend that I was sorry for hurting his feelings but that I just think he needs to learn that it's okay to be wrong sometimes and that no body would judge him if he learns to admit that rather than start an argument over things that don't need to be.
 
This upset him more and he basically told me that he felt betrayed by because I was supposed to have his back in front of my brothers and when I didn't I just made them laugh more and I caused him to feel humiliated because he couldn't even have my support. He told me that I should've corrected him In private rather than in front of my brothers?

Both our kids have had their fair share of minor health issues.  Multiple ear infections that led to ear tubes in our 3-year-old, flu, RSV, HFM, etc.  It's been a lot in a few short years and sometimes I genuinely wonder how we've made it through.  My brother has a running joke that we are single-handedly putting our pediatrician's kids through college.  We both have family nearby to help which has been a lifesaver at times.

This past weekend, my wife's mom and stepdad offered to take the boys to a nearby park to give us a break for a couple hours.  When they got back to our house, our 1-year-old was crying and upset and they told us he just seemed really tired and/or hungry.  My in-laws made some jokes about us not letting them watch the kids again then left and we got the kids some food and put them down for a nap.

When the 1-year-old woke up he still seemed out of it and was unable to put weight on his left leg.  At this point we knew something was up so we took him to urgent care.  On the way there, my wife called her mom to ask her if anything happened and she said he might have had a fall on one of the slides.  The doctors ended up doing an X-ray and found a minor spiral fracture.  So now he's in a cast, but thankfully won't require surgery.

She said that what our 3-year-old said isn't true but didn't give us a straight answer as to how our 1-year-old got hurt.  At this point I had enough and ended up going off on them.

78,1czrp9s,AITA for bringing up my dad's alcohol addiction?,"So, I (16F) and my dad (45M) were downstairs late in the evening watching TV together when an ad came on. It was basically a help & support line for people struggling with drug addiction. The lady in the ad said something along the lines of, ""is my life really worth less to you because of my addiction?"" and my dad, who was drunk at the time, sort of laughed and immediately followed up with ""yes"".

I was sort of like what the fuck dude? And asked him what he meant. He then went on this tangent about how it's their own fault they got addicted anyway, how society would be better without them, etc. I asked him what drugs he was referring to and he said weed, cocaine, meth, etc. Then I followed up by asking, ""what about nicotine and alcohol?""

My dad's an alcoholic. There's no way around it. I wanna be clear that he's never gotten into a deeply drunken stupor where he's verbally or physically hurt either me or my siblings, but he does drink almost every single night and has empty beer cans stacked up in literal pyramids in the hallway. That and he's been smoking for as long as I can remember. I also wanna be clear that obviously I understand that alcohol isn't as bad as fucking CRACK COCAINE, but it's still a drug, and an addictive one. Doesn't matter how societally accepted it is compared to the stuff he mentioned, it's just a fact.

Ofc, he started telling me that it wasn't the same thing because it's not as bad. I said ""but it's still a drug, and you're still addicted"". He started getting upset at this point and looking back, I think I should've stopped here, but I do find it ironic that after saying drug addicts should all just die, he stood up to walk to the front door to have another fucking cigarette. As he did that, I asked him if it was the same for him, since he was also addicted to drugs. I asked if he was ALSO just an idiot who the world would be better off without, and obviously he didn't answer that question (tbf I'm not sure how you would even answer that) and instead just started talking about how apparently the OTHER drug addicts were all useless to society, but HE isn't. 

I got really frustrated with him here because, to me, it felt like he was just being completely unempathetic. I went up the stairs and to my room, and I'm honestly just wondering if I actually did overreact here. Be honest. If I did I'll go apologise to him. But I'm just not of the belief that any unfortunate group of people DESERVE to die, and that HE of all people is a hypocrite for saying shit like that. Again, I don't believe that my dad should be blamed or ridiculed for his addiction either, which is part of why I'm so unsure about what I did here. I feel like I may have made light of his very real problems in trying to prove a point.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for bringing up my dad's alcohol addiction? So, I (16F) and my dad (45M) were downstairs late in the evening watching TV together when an ad came on. It was basically a help & support line for people struggling with drug addiction. The lady in the ad said something along the lines of, ""is my life really worth less to you because of my addiction?"" and my dad, who was drunk at the time, sort of laughed and immediately followed up with ""yes"".

I was sort of like what the fuck dude? And asked him what he meant. He then went on this tangent about how it's their own fault they got addicted anyway, how society would be better without them, etc. I asked him what drugs he was referring to and he said weed, cocaine, meth, etc. Then I followed up by asking, ""what about nicotine and alcohol?""

My dad's an alcoholic. There's no way around it. I wanna be clear that he's never gotten into a deeply drunken stupor where he's verbally or physically hurt either me or my siblings, but he does drink almost every single night and has empty beer cans stacked up in literal pyramids in the hallway. That and he's been smoking for as long as I can remember. I also wanna be clear that obviously I understand that alcohol isn't as bad as fucking CRACK COCAINE, but it's still a drug, and an addictive one. Doesn't matter how societally accepted it is compared to the stuff he mentioned, it's just a fact.

Ofc, he started telling me that it wasn't the same thing because it's not as bad. I said ""but it's still a drug, and you're still addicted"". He started getting upset at this point and looking back, I think I should've stopped here, but I do find it ironic that after saying drug addicts should all just die, he stood up to walk to the front door to have another fucking cigarette. As he did that, I asked him if it was the same for him, since he was also addicted to drugs. I asked if he was ALSO just an idiot who the world would be better off without, and obviously he didn't answer that question (tbf I'm not sure how you would even answer that) and instead just started talking about how apparently the OTHER drug addicts were all useless to society, but HE isn't. 

I got really frustrated with him here because, to me, it felt like he was just being completely unempathetic. I went up the stairs and to my room, and I'm honestly just wondering if I actually did overreact here. Be honest. If I did I'll go apologise to him. But I'm just not of the belief that any unfortunate group of people DESERVE to die, and that HE of all people is a hypocrite for saying shit like that. Again, I don't believe that my dad should be blamed or ridiculed for his addiction either, which is part of why I'm so unsure about what I did here. I feel like I may have made light of his very real problems in trying to prove a point.

79,1czrm0t,WIBTA if I purposefully excluded a work colleague from my birthday party/celebration?," I (F25) work in a STEM field and many of my colleagues are a similar age to me, and we all work in the same building (although we work on different projects). Due to our proximity, we have become very close friends and I would like to invite everyone from my project team and some of the members from other project teams to my birthday party in a few weeks (likely just a get together at my apartment, nothing crazy). Many others from our group have had similar parties and invite everyone, & it is always a good time.

However, there is one guy, Ed (fake name, M24) who is not a part of my project team (but is part of the larger group). When I first started working here, I was very nice to him and would chat with him whenever he came by. I am fairly certain he has a crush on me (he will frequently come to my office just to chat, or to get a reaction out of me about my favorite sports team, will frequently comment about my outfits/makeup, or will sit next to me whenever he has a chance, even if it is the inconvenient choice). But, I find him very mean, he often makes rude comments about others and sometimes also more general homophobic, racist, or otherwise ignorant comments, which he always claims is ""okay"" because ""\[He's\] autistic."" I do understand that some people who are autistic have a hard time understanding social cues, and Ed is also not from the same country as most of the rest of us, so I understand there are things that may not come as naturally, but I do not think being autistic is an excuse to be rude/mean/to blatantly ignore others after they tell him explicitly his comments make them uncomfortable. I have tried to set boundaries (e.g. ""I don't have time to chat, please do not come to my office because when I am here it is to work, and you are not on my project team"" or blocking his phone number after he called me after he found out my phone number from a friend by accident saying ""I didn't give you my number, I don't want you to have it"", etc.).

As a result, I don't want to invite him to my birthday because I know him being there will make me uncomfortable. My boyfriend will also be there, and the 2 of them have not yet met, which I think will add to the awkwardness - Ed has made some sexual comments in the past and has been been insistently asking ""when do I get to meet your boyfriend?"" If it is held at my apartment, I know I would be uncomfortable with him being in my space.

 Recently, I've been putting faucet water in big bottles in the freezer, because I was planning on doing an experiment with ice in a shape of a bottle. They were taking too long so I kind of forgot about them, but today it pop upped my head. When i opened the freezer, to my surprised it was empty. 

 So I refilled it on the kitchen, then a family member saw me refill it and ask we where it comes from. I told them it was from the faucet. Then they told me that everyone else have been drinking from the bottle. I asked why they drank it without knowing where it came from or who owns it, but he deflects and said it was fine.

 Then hours later they called me and said that they now have a stomachache, and blamed me for putting the faucet water in the freezer. Then they said to dispose of it because I was misleading them into thinking that it was clean and that I might give my other family members stomachache. 

 I got pretty heated at that moment because i was in a bad mood and told them that it's their fault for even drinking it without knowing what's Its content or origin. I told them why didn't they asked anyone whose it's from or what was inside of it. I asked them why did they just drank it without even asking first, and when they suddenly got a stomachache, the first thing they thought of was blaming me for their own fault. I asked them is it okay if it was food and you got stomachache from eating something that was not yours?

 They answer back and said that it doesn't matter, and that I should take responsibility because it was already done. And because the water was in the freezer, it would makes sense that if anyone saw that, they would drink it regardless because ""it was water""?
 
 MFW they said that, I just got angry and said it was their own fault for not even asking permission. Talking about morals like it's okay to blame me from your own doing?

My sister has loved it for my nephew. He's autistic and has a lot of trouble socializing and with overstimulation. He's known to have meltdowns in class and there were times my son was asked to stay with him while the class was evacuated. I had to step in and speak to the teacher as well as the principal about this because my son was terrified. They were ""seat friends"" all year and they are the only two kids who never got a new seat friend. The teacher kept them together because she was worried my nephew would be bullied by other kids. But it was hard for my son. He's very shy and introverted and sometimes my nephew getting upset would upset him. My son was also used to supply my nephew with pencils and other tools when my nephew would break them.

My sister was so happy they were together. My son was miserable and I hated seeing him that way. My sister went to the school a month ago and requested they be kept together next grade. She mentioned it in passing during a family BBQ. I asked her why she did this and she told me it's working great for my nephew.

86,1czquws,AITA For Asking a Neighbor's Boyfriend to Park Somewhere Else,"First and foremost, I understand that the road is the road and that no one can ""claim"" any spots along the road. I live in a small suburban neighborhood where the parking situation is a little difficult. As many of us now live in multi-generational homes, there are a lot of vehicles in the road. I have neighbors that live directly across from me who have 3 vehicles in the road, and then the house diagonally from me takes up 4 spaces in the road (each house also has a driveway that fits two vehicles each) and then there's just my vehicle, where I typically park right in front of my house.

One night, I came home after working a 13-hour day to my (the house diagonally from me) neighbor's boyfriend's truck in the spot I typically park in. (This neighborhood is small enough to where everyone typically parks in the same spot all of the time and we know who is who.) I knock on their door to ask him if he wouldn't mind moving, and he told me ""No,"" and that the road is the road and that anyone could park where they wanted. I told him that I understood that and that it was fair, but just explained that it was common courtesy, and that he doesn't even live there (he doesn't even stay overnight either.) I parked about a block away from my house, but as I walked up to my door, that's when he then decided to leave.

I figured if he was going to be petty, then I can be, too. So now, we leave our trashcan out at the curb for just enough space for my vehicle in between that and the other neighbor's truck who also parks in front of my house. 

Last night, he moved the trashcan so that his truck could fit. When I came home, there was actually just enough space for me to park, however, he was sandwiched in between my vehicle and the other truck. They were outside, immediately asked me to move so that he could leave, and I said ""sure."" I moved my vehicle just enough for him to leave, to which he then parks right next to his girlfriend's house anyway. So, I asked him why he didn't just park there in the first place, and why is there an issue to do so. Then he doesn't even answer any of my questions, just goes on to argue with me. (I unknowingly recorded this entire interaction BTW.) I told him that I understand how he feels, but that I didn't have to move my vehicle then, because ""the road is the road.""

IDK, I feel like this is just very petty at this point and all I want is to be able to park in the one spot after working a long ass day. I don't even care to argue with someone who talks over me when I'm trying to explain my POV and, most importantly, someone who does not even live there. If it was someone who lived there, it wouldn't be an issue to me.

I have neighbors that live directly across from me who have 3 vehicles in the road, and then the house diagonally from me takes up 4 spaces in the road (each house also has a driveway that fits two vehicles each) and then there's just my vehicle, where I typically park right in front of my house.

One night, I came home after working a 13-hour day to my (the house diagonally from me) neighbor's boyfriend's truck in the spot I typically park in. (This neighborhood is small enough to where everyone typically parks in the same spot all of the time and we know who is who.) I knock on their door to ask him if he wouldn't mind moving, and he told me ""No,"" and that the road is the road and that anyone could park where they wanted. I told him that I understood that and that it was fair, but just explained that it was common courtesy, and that he doesn't even live there (he doesn't even stay overnight either.) I parked about a block away from my house, but as I walked up to my door, that's when he then decided to leave.

I figured if he was going to be petty, then I can be, too. So now, we leave our trashcan out at the curb for just enough space for my vehicle in between that and the other neighbor's truck who also parks in front of my house. 

Last night, he moved the trashcan so that his truck could fit. When I came home, there was actually just enough space for me to park, however, he was sandwiched in between my vehicle and the other truck. They were outside, immediately asked me to move so that he could leave, and I said ""sure."" I moved my vehicle just enough for him to leave, to which he then parks right next to his girlfriend's house anyway. So, I asked him why he didn't just park there in the first place, and why is there an issue to do so. Then he doesn't even answer any of my questions, just goes on to argue with me. (I unknowingly recorded this entire interaction BTW.) I told him that I understand how he feels, but that I didn't have to move my vehicle then, because ""the road is the road.""

IDK, I feel like this is just very petty at this point and all I want is to be able to park in the one spot after working a long ass day. I don't even care to argue with someone who talks over me when I'm trying to explain my POV and, most importantly, someone who does not even live there. If it was someone who lived there, it wouldn't be an issue to me. In my mind, because it's such a small town, I feel like it's just a common courtesy issue, but I understand that the road is the road... AITA??",1.0,0.9819826483726501,1,1
87,1czqd0m,AITAH for Having My Team's Back?,"I'm on my school's volleyball team, and we've been practicing hard for the upcoming tournament. It's been a spirited battle, with lots of action and team spirit. As the tournament gets closer, excitement fills the gym like the bouncing of volleyballs.

One of our lively teammates, let's call her Emily, has always been by my side since we started. We've shared many moments together, but lately, Emily seems filled with doubts.

Before the tournament, there's always tension. We all feel the pressure from months of hard work. While the rest of us keep going, Emily struggles. This leads to more mistakes and hesitations, which hurts our team unity.

As the tournament goes on, tensions rise with each game. Every move is a chance to show what we're made of. But conflicts arise, putting a distance between me and Emily.

As we get ready for our last game, I notice Emily looking unsure. I try to reassure her, but she's lost in her thoughts. This makes me doubt myself after weeks of worrying.

In that moment, I decide to focus on teamwork. I rally our team to show the power of working together. Emily stands with me, empowered by our friendship.

After the competition, Emily thanks me for being there for her. Our coach is proud of us both. It makes me realize that supporting each other is what matters most.

Looking back, I believe in teamwork and supporting each other. Was it the right thing to do, or did I let doubt and distance get in the way? Am I the asshole for organizing our volleyball team and standing up for my teammate during the championship?

90,1czq0br,AITA for treating my close friend differently after she said some weird things while blacked out?,"To preface the whole situation, my friend (26 F) and I (22 F) met only 7 months ago through nursing school. We are polar opposites already but we still get along well. She already had been doing some suspicious things by inviting me and my other close friend to hang out with her and some girls that she knew didn’t like us. She admitted that these girls hated us and were always taking badly about us while she was drunk but had been swearing they loved us while sober. I was able to get over that because I loved hanging out with her. But recently me and my friend J (21F) invited her out to drink. We went hard and pretty much blacked out. She was the worst of us though which is when the issue starts. First, she calls my friend and I servants (she’s rich and we’re poor) okay that’s fine. But then while I’m taking care of her she says “you and J are fat and that’s okay” and we’re not skinny girls but I didn’t think we were that fat to where someone would be thinking about it enough to say it while blacked out. Okay, I still get her home and try putting her in bed and then she calls me a fat bitch? I know she was blacked out but it’s really left a bad taste in my mouth. I don’t care that she called us fat whatever, but I just feel like it revealed a lot about her character. Side note: I’m not being mean to her just standoffish because we used to be way closer.

91,1czpqty,AITA for saying no to babysitting my sister's almost stepson during her wedding?,"My sister Leigh (28f) is getting married to Daniel (30m) in two weeks. Daniel has an 8 year old son called Kingsley. Last week Leigh asked me if I (20m) would babysit Kingsley during the wedding. She said Daniel's parents were supposed to do it but they were refusing and it had become such a big argument that she thought of me. I asked her why Daniel's parents were saying no and she said they were worried about Kingsley's behavior. I asked her why she'd think I would want to and she told me because I want her to enjoy her wedding(?) and because I'm a great little brother and to think about it as bonding with my almost nephew. I told her I didn't want to deal with his anger and tantrums and that there was no way we'd be bonding when he doesn't want his dad to get married again. Leigh told me they needed someone to do it because if he makes a scene it would delay the whole wedding if she or Daniel has to deal with it. She told me he might not be happy, he might be missing his mom (Kingsley's mom died), but she and Daniel are doing everything to help him through this and to show him that he has a bigger family now and doesn't need to chase her off or reject her. She said she is showing him that she will always be around even if he hates it right now. And for things to go well she needs me to come through for her.

I still said no and Leigh was upset. She and Daniel called me two days later and asked if I would reconsider if they paid me. I told them I wouldn't and suggested they use that money and hire someone if they really want Kingsley to have a babysitter.

Leigh tried begging but Daniel was pissed at that point and told me I was throwing away the chance to help my sister and get to know his son.

92,1czpo0w,WIBTA for not taking my daughter to see her paternal grandparents anymore? ,"19f) hate my boyfriends (20m) family. My whole pregnancy not once was i asked a question they only asked my boyfriend, and i mean blatant questions he more than likely would not know like “is the baby kicking a lot today?” meanwhile hes been at work for 7 hours. They always say how much they NEED to see my daughter and how much they NEED us to call them and we NEED to go over. 

His step grandpa freaks me out to no end, hes always asking for hugs or to hold my hand, he goes on long rants about god which i am fine with considering i’m a christian, but hes a catholic which i also have no issue with but he seemingly has a issue with christians and always says “let me teach you the catholic way! the RIGHT way!” His step grandma is just blatantly rude. She only buys the baby things that says “daddys girl!” or something about a great grandma. She never acknowledges me to be honest. I heard her sneakily telling his step mom “just wait until OP has to start cleaning a house and cook for a family, i dont think shes cut out” as if (for now) im not a SAHM, all i do is clean? She smokes cigarettes which whatever you do you, but abe refuses to wash her hands after smoking then tries to touch my daughter, and when i try to say something they all get so mad at me. 

Back to his step mom though. She wanted to throw my baby shower when i was pregnant and i said no because she wanted it at her house, which would normally be fine but she only was going to invite her friends and her family which i found weird because i do not know them. I told my boyfriend if he wants it he can go to the baby shower but i will not be made out to be a idiot because i have no clue who these people are. So we ultimately said no. Well, after i said no she didnt talk to us for almost a month, then his step moms mom texted my boyfriend saying how i needed to apologize and i was so rude. i asked his step mom NOT to post our daughter because shes friends with someone who hurt me as a childs mom and i didnt want them to know i had a baby. either way shes posted my daughter 3 times now and when we asked her to delete them she blatantly said no because “how would they know its your baby” yet shes tagged my boyfriend and im all over his account. She refuses to let my boyfriends father hold the baby for longer than 5 minutes before she scoops her back up and takes more pictures. She also crossed a major boundary one day by changing my daughters diaper while i wasnt there. I do not like people besides me and my bf changing my babys diaper, because she has some health issues and i need to make sure shes peeing/pooping regularly. She also held the paci with her mouth one time then tried to give it back to my daughter?

His bio dad doesn’t bother me, hes nice to me, he always says he loves me and asks how i myself am doing. I just really do not like the step side of his family at all.

I left my 20 cents in the machine along with my casino card inside it and my phone. I told him I would be right back and to watch the machine so no one took my stuff. 

I grabbed my cash from the atm and went back to the machine next to him. I was only gone for 2 minutes. I get back and realize my 20 cents is gone.

96,1czpl1e,AITA for not using a friend to sell a flip house,"Yrs ago I was just starting out as a house flipper and didn’t know much about the industry. A friend who was a part time real estate agent and real estate investor was acting as my real estate agent. The market was very tight and we looked at a bunch of houses. He had more experience and could see potential issues and or potential faster than I could at this point. But I needed to go through the houses so I could see what he saw and understand the issues first hand. Basically, I was learning on the job. He got frustrated with me for having to see these houses and I was frustrated with him for not spending the time I needed to learn what to look for. 

Fast forward to us finally finding a house, me buying it, fixing it, and getting ready to sell it.  So I called my friend and said, “hey, the house is done and I’m ready to list it” . He came to see the house, thought it looked good and said, “listen, I know we were frustrated with each other during the buying process. So I will not be hurt if you want to use someone else to sell the house. Our friendship is more important than me selling this house.” So I thought about it and the next day said, “I thought about it and you are right, I don’t want to get upset at you and or hurt our friendship of this doesn’t work out, so I’m gonna use someone else”. Well, he was not happy about this and basically never talked to me again. This was about 15yrs ago.

98,1czpguh,AITA for exercising on a bachelorette cruise?,"I (28F) went on a three day bachelorette cruise celebrating my best friend (28F), the Bride-To-Be last week. We cruised to the Bahamas as a group of four: me, the Bride, and two other bridesmaids (28F and 30F), splitting two connecting cabins. We were all friends in college, so we get along nicely together.

My best friend, the Bride, is a beautiful woman. However, she doesn’t feel this way now that she’s put on some weight in the years since we graduated from college. I’ve seen her try to start healthy habits, like joining a local Pilates club and eating healthier, but nothing seems to stick with her. Her mom puts pressure on her to lose weight for the wedding (she was stick-thin in college), and when this topic pops up I am supportive of the beauty she is right now!

I would say though, that I do consistently maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle. I’m a runner, I exercise on my off days, and I try my best to eat healthy. 

When we all arrived on the cruise ship, things were going well! We unpacked, took some pictures, hit the pool, the classic cruise itinerary. That night the Bride and other Bridesmaids got pretty wasted. I don’t drink too much because I don’t like the way alcohol makes me feel. So the next morning when everyone was sleeping off their hangovers, I quietly got dressed and went to the gym. 

When I came back, the girls were stirring awake and getting ready for breakfast. The Bride made a comment about my trip to the gym… something along the lines of “I can’t imagine exercising on vacation”. I laughed it off and didn’t think too much of it, until we got to breakfast. I picked up regular foods to me: eggs, whole grain toast, and fruit. I didn’t even think about what everyone else was eating until another bridesmaid made a comment to me “do you even eat sugar?”. The girls had fun cruise food: waffles, donuts, whatever. 

That day we had fun in Nassau and I tried my best to have a “typical” cruise dinner to blend in. 

The morning before we were supposed to disembark, I woke up early - before any of the girls got up- and quietly made my way to the gym one last time.

When I came back, the Bride was in the shower, and I was confronted by the other two bridesmaids. They let me know that my exercising and healthy eating was making the Bride really insecure, and asked me to be more sensitive during the wedding.

99,1czotpp,AITA for continuing to support my students after leaving my job,"I was a dance instructor for 10 years at a studio. Approx. 5 years ago we brought in a new director and we hit it off great! We were a great team. Fast forward to last summer, I get pulled aside by this director out of nowhere and told that I won't be getting any of my competitive classes because I'm too aggressive with the students and can't be trusted in high stress situations. After asking for examples, I was given a few that were entirely explained away and I asked if the people involved or anyone had made complaints. I was told no. This was just feelings my director had. I ended up quitting the next day because I didn't feel like I could continue working in an environment where I now felt I had to walk on eggshells.

Fast forward to the first competition. I went to support and it was not received well by the director. Many parents and students were ecstatic to see me and some had even invited me. It was relayed to me (through different people) that the director found it inappropriate I was there and in the dressing room. (I actually helped some of my old dancers with hair and costumes) I was told she wanted me to stay in the auditorium if I had to be there at all. She also did not like that I was back stage. I never went backstage. 

She has claimed that I am twisting her words and said I said I would tell people I left for personal reasons.

Not trying to cause any unnecessary drama or stress.. and my old dancers heard I was there. During a break they came running in to show me the awards they had won and give me hugs and tell me how excited and happy they were I could come watch them.

  
When someone I am close to mentioned to the director that it sounds like she needs to have a conversation with me, she refused and said she will not be doing that so in my mind theres not an issue if you are not willing to address it.

I am continuously asked by students and parents to come to events and support/help. And continuously ignored or avoided by the studio director. The director told a former coworker of mine whom I am still really close with that she knows my true intentions. My only intention is to continue to support people I have built such a strong foundation with.

I am torn between continuing to support the dancers I have known and loved and helped train the past 10 years because ultimately I decided to leave but under pretty pressing circumstances.

It took me about 45 minutes, when I was finished it was around 9:30pm. My husband came upstairs and I asked if it was alright if I played video games for 30 minutes before I went to bed (10pm), he insisted that I immediately do so because I’ve been doing so much all week and had me sit down in my chair and insisted I relax. He went back downstairs with my best friend (they had been watching a tv show all night that I’ve never seen before nor do I really care for, but I spent over 2 hours watching it even though they were over 3 seasons in). He did inform her that I was retiring for the night and was playing games for a bit before going to bed.

102,1czo7to,AITA for clapping back at a friend who is upset at not being invited to a festival?,"To make a long story short, my partner’s best friend (and my close friend), we’ll call him John, has been dating a woman for about 6 years now. We have a friendship group of about 20 ppl, including everyone’s partners, and tend to often do separate things with each other, as it’s hard to organise and keep track of each person attending things. 

John’s girlfriend is incredibly confrontational and has been known to throw food/drinks (or whatever is in her hand) when drunk and arguing. She likes to get drunk and bring up events that she has not been invited to, or how people couldn’t afford to spend money on flights and hotels to travel to her home country for her birthday. She will often call you over to her and interrogate/pressure you into awkward conversations about whatever has recently upset her, due to this I try to avoid her as I hate confrontation. She has tried to gossip to me about my own friends, and I have to awkwardly decline the conversation. Recently at John’s birthday party, she asked me to leave so she could speak to
my best friend about something “she couldn’t tell me about”, when I asked my best friend she said it was simply that she wasn’t invited to an evening a few months ago. She had already spoken to me about this, and I had explained that lots of ppl weren’t invited and it wasn’t personal, I was sorry if I upset her etc. 

Since then, I have been quite frustrated at the fact that she dismissed me in order to gossip, but have actively tried to include her in more events so she feels included. A few months ago, a work colleague of mine and my two best friends managed to get us tickets to a festival. The maximum amount of tickets you can purchase is six, so naturally my two best friends, work colleague and two of our partners are the ones we invited. My colleague does not know John’s girlfriend, so herself and John have not been invited.

Last weekend John’s girlfriend brought up the fact they were not invited and after half an hour of explaining to her nicely the reason, and my best friend also explaining for even longer, the situation blew up. We’d all had lots of drinks and the situation got heated, we shouted that she cannot be bringing up problems every weekend, especially if a majority of the people in our friendship group are not invited either. She ended up throwing a drink at us and storming out. My partner has spoken to John before about how his girlfriend makes people uncomfortable but he has been turning a blind eye, he’s said he’s worried if he breaks up with her she will break his furniture. Personally I don’t feel remorse for exploding at her as I’ve tried to be empathetic and calm with her for years now, but John is very annoyed and so is my partner. I do wish we had handled it better, but I also don’t feel the need to apologise, like John wants me to. So AITA and should I apologise for raising my voice at her? 

(Just as a final note, I am aware this all sounds very trivial and childish and I am upset that I’m even involved. As I have upset my partner’s best friend, it has caused a big disruption in our friendship group as John’s girlfriend is refusing to speak to me or anyone else involved. I obviously do not want to upset her, but also don’t want any more of her negativity in my life. Thanks for your help!)

104,1cznrgd,AITA for not letting my estranged father's wife hold my son?,"I (26m) have been estranged from my father for 16 years. After my mom died he just left. He didn't even take me someplace safe. He walked out of the house and didn't come back. He missed her funeral and he wasn't around to take care of me or anything afterward. I was taken in by my uncle (my mom's brother) and he finished raising me. My father's family remained a part of my life and I have a few good relationships with them.

Two years ago my father reconciled with some of the members of his family but not all (including me who has not spoken to him since I was 10). I have seen him twice before this weekend when I saw him for a third time. This time his wife was also with him. It was at a party for one of my cousins. My aunt, aka cousins mom, invited them. My wife and I were also there and so was our 7 week old son.

While my cousin (the birthday girl), my wife and I were talking my father's wife approached and introduced herself and she said she could not wait to be a grandma and asked to hold my son. I told her she could not. She was all smiles up to then but the smile fell and she asked me why. I told her I didn't let random strangers hold my son. She told me she's not a random stranger, she's his grandmother. My cousin stepped in and moved her along. My cousin was like wtf with my wife and me. We did our best to stay out of my father's wife's way afterward. But she came over again as we were leaving and asked to hold my son again. I told her no yet again. My aunt (birthday cousins mom) was also present and the two of them told me I was being harsh and to let her hold the baby. She told me I'm treating her like a criminal. I told her I was treating her like the random stranger that she is.

My cousin heard the end of it and scolded her mom and my father's wife when we were gone and called me to apologize for what happened. I apologized to her for having that play out at her birthday.

My aunt gave my father's wife my number and the two of them told me I behaved childishly and I should consider my son and what is best for him. And how I treated this innocent woman poorly.

But ever since shifting for school to a big city has led to me becoming more and more confrontational with people, earlier I would try to diffuse the situation.
Since I live in a hostel where we can't make our own food, I always have to head to a small dinner area to eat food with atleast like 4 people. I'm from more like a rural tribalist area and I'm not familiar with city foods that much.
Everything was normal and he was cooking, I asked what's for food and he started to get annoyed and started ranting about how people keep disturbing him and mixing in utensils after taking the food and being aggressive for some reason.
I initially ignored him and walked to take the plate and started to look for what I wanted to eat and he still kept ranting. 
I told him to calm down and that I just asked what's for dinner. He took the utensil and tried to give the food himself aggresively.
I don't know why he was being aggressive and I lost my cool and started to argue with him to calm down and that I just asked for food and stop being so annoying.
I was getting angry and just took the food and sat on the table as the other 3 guys sat there awkwardly and the cook still kept ranting.
Me and the cook had always had a Positive encounter and this time he was getting on my nerve. I quickly ate my food and left.
This isn't the first time ive lost my cool in a long time and can feel myself getting some sort of anger issues with some city people and their rude nature.
I feel like I was being an asshole to the cook and should've been more calmer but I also think he was being too aggressive.

107,1czn9zx,AITA for making my husband a chore chart?,"My (32F) husband (36M) recently took a job in which he works less and makes less because he wanted to improve his work/life balance. He was previously working a standard 40 hour week. He now works 30 hours or less. He typically starts work between 8-9, takes an hour lunch, and comes home between 12-3pm. He usually takes Fridays off. About once a month he has to stay later at work and comes home around 6pm. I have worked 40 hours for the past 3 years and recently took a job that has a slightly higher difficulty level for more money. My husband really wanted me to take this job because it’s more money and less of a commute. My hours are 8-5pm with an hour lunch. I usually get home around 5:30-6pm. We split bills 50/50 but have discussed me contributing a higher percentage since I now make more. We haven’t done this yet because I just started and we have not had the time to figure out the details. Admittedly, my husband does several things for the household. He does all the lawn care, cooks meals 2-3 times per week, and takes the trash to the dump once a week or every other week. I don’t do any of these tasks. When he cooks, I do the dishes. We both do shared laundry (towels) and take care of our pets. However, other tasks in our home are not getting done and I find myself having to spend several hours of my weekend cleaning the whole house to maintain a basic cleanliness level. If I do not clean on the weekends (which definitely happens because life), it doesn’t get done and I start to feel stressed out because of the mess. So, I decided to make a chore chart outlining things that need to be done daily, weekly, and monthly to maintain a relatively clean household. The chart was for both of us and included a spot to mark when/who completed what chore. I suggested a 60/40 split in how the chores are divided since he has more time than I do. I included the chores he already does on the list and I asked him to add/change/suggest anything he wanted. He was very upset with this idea and said he was not going to clean up my messes and that I just wanted to dictate his “free time.” I told him I was open to other suggestions and he had none. I have suggested we hire someone to help out, but he has always been opposed. By the end of the argument, he accused me of being lazy and just wanting him to do everything. He told me that my job wasn’t hard because I just started and I’m in training but the few hours he works are grueling and he shouldn’t be expected to do anything more. He thinks a chore chart is stupid because we should just do the things we see need to be done instead of using a chart to track it. My theory is he is opposed because he feels infantilized or he just doesn’t want to do anything else so he can use his free time however he wants. Am I wrong for suggesting the 60/40 split? Should it be 50/50?

Anyway, when we started therapy we were all asked why we were there. My dad said he did not feel like my stepbrother or I had really let the family change in our hearts.

Last week we had a session and we had to do this weird questionnaire. The counselor said she wanted to see how well we all knew each other. So the question was what is their favorite food, favorite color and favorite thing to do. On my list she included my mom and my little brother who died the same time as our mom. This was on top of each other and the stepfamily members including my half siblings.

Stepmom didn't know mine or most of her son's and dad knew most of mine but not everything.

After we left the session, with instructions to reflect but not fight about what we discovered that day, my dad and stepmom were pretty damn pissed and she was hurt that I knew what my brother had liked before he died and he was only 4 but not any of my new living family members. My stepmom said I could remember my mom and brother so well and knew dad before so well that it shows I didn't even try to get to know the rest of them as well.

I usually work evenings, and don't get off work at a ""normal"" time on my possible nights out, as I work 6 to 10pm and typically when I can arrive at a local bar, most ""day job"" people are leaving to head home for the night. 

Despite this agreement on when we can go out, I only had one night option to make the year end party work for the local organization I'm a part of, as I work Wednesday and Friday this week. A dozen other people agreed Thursday was the only night of the week that worked for them to gather at the restaurant. So that's what I decided had to work for me as well.

It was the year end party so it was a time to socialize beyond meeting business with people in the group, which felt refreshing, and is a ONCE A YEAR annual party thing, and I feel like I shouldn't be made to feel bad about using ""his"" night out when there were extenuating circumstances.

I can understand having designated times to go out, but this is what worked for gathering with people this time. 

After the last few weeks we had, with a sick kid who was in the hospital and is thankfully home again, I just wanted a night to hang out with people. I'm a stay at home mom by day and usually don't get a chance to just be myself around other adults. It's not often I can even go out when day job people are usually out. On my designated nights out, I'm off work so late the crowd is totally different by the time I can even go out. So after our group ate, I decided to play pool with one of the group members, because it's something I enjoy doing and finally had someone to play with that wasn't a random dude at the bar.

I was still home before I would've been if I had gone to work.

When he asked how my night went, I told him I won at the games of pool I played and had some cool combo shots and it felt good. But he didn't seem to care. I think he was under the impression I would've spoke more on ""meeting business"" since I told him last night was for the organization I'm in; but this wasn't a meeting, it was a celebration of the community work our group has been doing and a chance to relax and unwind together in light of the good work our group has done the past year, and I shared what I was most excited about. 

Instead of being happy for me that I was able to socialize and feel like a normal adult, he got flustered and said ""oh so if I have something to do on your night out I can just do that."" Which I wouldn't mind if there were something he really wanted to do. There have been times I haven't been able to do what I wanted, because he had other things planned. Such is life.

In my mind, this felt like a time that should have been able to make a compromise. But instead it feels like I'm an asshole.

She suffers from anxiety, and there are times where she ""gets blocked"" and everything is awful (the rest of the day/week/month). I try to cheer or console her, be generally supportive, help in any way I can.
But lately, I'm feeling a little judged and attacked, because she is bringing past relationship experiences and getting anxious and annoyed from something that I may do that makes her remember them.

Yesterday my boss asked me to stay more time at work (I have a job with a certain degree of responsibility), as we are approaching a big delivery date.
She got REALLY UPSET, and started telling me that there's more to life than work, she's tired of hearing about ""big delivery dates"", etc.
Until now, I've NEVER given her any such problems, although I've had to deal with those extra hours on my own, when she wasn't around (we don't yet live together).

After ignoring me all the afternoon and being moody, we talked and I said some things that may have annoyed her (but I promise, they weren't meant to be hurtful, and they were quite common sense, although she wasn't in the mood for them).

Late at night, she got real sad and said she was sorry, and I accepted it.

However, she asked me to apologise, and I didn't.
I measured very much my words not to be cruel and hurtful, and if she got annoyed/hurt earlier, it's not my problem.

We both come from poor families, so we've always been very responsible with money. We used to live very frugal, which allowed us to buy a home and raise our kids. 

Now we both have stable jobs and started earning well. My salary got doubled last year and we literally didn't know how to adapt. I've been trying to persuade her to change our standard of living and spend more on better stuff, but she is reluctant. She constantly worries that it can all disappear, so she tries not to spend too much and as a result money just piles up pointlessly. 

She has a very cheap phone that's driving her crazy how buggy it is and makes horrible photos (she likes to take photos of our kids for memories). So I bought her a very good and expensive one even though she was strongly against it when I suggested it. 

She says it's way above her standard, she doesn't want to look like a shallow person with things she doesn't need and it is very expensive. It's actually a 1/3 of my monthly salary, but in her eyes it's too much. 

We got it today and now she doesn't speak to me. She says I should use it, sell it, or do whatever I want with it, but she won't use it. 

I know she would like it if it wasn't for the price, because we talked about what she wants in a phone and I've shown it to her before, so the only problem is the price. We have a shared budget.

We rarely ever fight, but this time she's very stubborn and ignores me altogether.

I visited my father as much as I could (I live 7hrs away from my parents) about 2x a year, and saw his condition worsen. When he died, I was in shock, and cried for a bit, but knew he wasn’t suffering anymore, so I was ok. Same with my mother, she was with him when he died (because she was his caregiver), and when it happened my mother called me and gave me the news. She didn’t cry at all on the phone, she just told me how much she loved him and will miss him. 

Now my bf met my mother twice, and my dad once. However when he heard that he died, he had a very different reaction than the rest of my family. He had tears, he hugged me. It was as if he had known him for a long time. It’s weird, because for as long as I’ve been with him (4 years) I always complained about how controlling and insensitive my father was to me and my mother. I won’t get into too many details, but he most certainly is the reason for my anxiety now, along with my people pleasing tendencies. I loved my dad, but he was not great to be around sometimes. ANYWAY, the point here, is my bf had a reaction I would expect, but also not expect. 

When my father passed, my mother said she was alright. didn’t need help with cooking (because her neighbors,who are actual caterers, are making food for her and my brother is there), the house doesn’t need cleaning, and she has a huge support system (my brother, her mother, her best friends, her sisters, etc). She did say that when it came time to sit down and do the actual paperwork she’ll need my help. Otherwise she would rather me help her with invitations to the funeral and make a slideshow right now  which I said I would definitely help. 

Here is the issue, my bf is making me feel like I’m making excuses for not wanting to go home and see her. He says I need to be there for my mother physically right now and wants me to drop everything, all my scheduled work and doctor appointments to drive home. There is literally nothing to do when I get home and the support I’m giving her now is sufficient according to my mom. Again, 2 days ago he passed. Yes I will go home and stay home on June 1st, and help out and attend the funeral two weeks after that, but I’m not leaving the day after hearing the news, the day before an important work event, to drive home and do nothing.

118,1czjpj5,AITA For Wearing Shorts and a T-Shirt to a Kindergarten Graduation?,"I (38) was about to leave to drop our daughter (6, call her Betsy) off at school, her kindergarten graduation (it’s really a promotion ceremony, but they’re calling it a graduation, semantics) was later that morning. I was going to have to wait at school for about an hour in between drop off and the ceremony because it didn’t make sense to come home. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. As I was about to get out the door, my partner (41, we’ll use the name Kelly) said “oh, are you coming back?” I said “no, I’m staying there, it doesn’t make sense to come back.” Kelly said “That’s what you’re wearing? I’d rather that you wear a collared shirt. The shorts are ok I guess, but we’re going to be taking pictures and I want you to wear a collared shirt.” I said “it’s a kindergarten graduation, not a high school one.”

There is no dress code imposed on the event. 

Kelly made another snippy comment and I decided to grab a collared quarter zip, so I put that on and came back downstairs to take Betsy to school. As I came back downstairs, Kelly kept hounding me, said “there are going to be people there in suits and ties, is that really what you were going to wear?” I didn’t really know how to respond so I just said “OK”. 

I prefer shorts and a t-shirt because that’s what I’m most comfortable in (Kelly insists I’m autistic, a blend of Sheldon Cooper and Adrian Monk) but I’ve never been evaluated, maybe it’s a texture thing?). I understand there are certain events (high school graduations, weddings, recitals, etc) that require slacks and a nice shirt at a minimum, and I follow suit when needed, I just don’t think a kindergarten graduation meets that threshold.

So I hope this little window into our morning shows that I’m not minimizing Betsy. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA For Wearing Shorts and a T-Shirt to a Kindergarten Graduation? I (38) was about to leave to drop our daughter (6, call her Betsy) off at school, her kindergarten graduation (it’s really a promotion ceremony, but they’re calling it a graduation, semantics) was later that morning. I was going to have to wait at school for about an hour in between drop off and the ceremony because it didn’t make sense to come home. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. As I was about to get out the door, my partner (41, we’ll use the name Kelly) said “oh, are you coming back?” I said “no, I’m staying there, it doesn’t make sense to come back.” Kelly said “That’s what you’re wearing? I’d rather that you wear a collared shirt. The shorts are ok I guess, but we’re going to be taking pictures and I want you to wear a collared shirt.” I said “it’s a kindergarten graduation, not a high school one.”

There is no dress code imposed on the event. 

Kelly made another snippy comment and I decided to grab a collared quarter zip, so I put that on and came back downstairs to take Betsy to school. As I came back downstairs, Kelly kept hounding me, said “there are going to be people there in suits and ties, is that really what you were going to wear?” I didn’t really know how to respond so I just said “OK”. 

I prefer shorts and a t-shirt because that’s what I’m most comfortable in (Kelly insists I’m autistic, a blend of Sheldon Cooper and Adrian Monk) but I’ve never been evaluated, maybe it’s a texture thing?). I understand there are certain events (high school graduations, weddings, recitals, etc) that require slacks and a nice shirt at a minimum, and I follow suit when needed, I just don’t think a kindergarten graduation meets that threshold.

We broke up a month ago but keep in touch a little bit. Yesterday he told me he was very very down. I met him and we sat in his car for an hour while he cried, talked about how he didn't know what was wrong with him, but that he was very depressed. 

I was very worried about him when he left. 

I don't feel like I am in a good position to help him as his ex, but I called one of his friends and texted another asking them to stay close and keep an eye on him because he's struggling.

He's extremely angry with me for doing this because he says he's fine again today but now all his friends are reaching out and he is embarrassed that they know he's not doing well with his mental health. 

But his friends have rallied and they're calling to his place and making sure to invite him out so that he doesn't feel alone. So I think it's probably better that they know?

120,1cziqkv,AITA for “not caring enough” and “breaking boundaries”?,"I (23) have 3 friends who I have known since I was 13-17. Let’s call them Gary (22M), Elisa (20F), and Stuart (21M) respectively. Out of the group, I had known Gary since I was 13 and I met Elisa and Stuart when I was 17 and we’ve been close friends since. Well, last year, I had gotten into my first relationship (admittedly, rather quickly since we had just met) and it only lasted about a week. My ex and I did agree to continue being friends at least. Naturally, I introduced my ex to my close friends and asked Gary, Elisa, and Stuart if they were alright if all of us played together to which they agreed.

A few months later after some nights of all of us playing together, my close friends told me not to have my ex around them anymore as they felt uncomfortable around him which I was fine with. To try to help things, I would tell them if he joined me in a game since they sometimes liked to randomly join me in a game I’m on. 
Today, however, Elisa suddenly left all the group chats I was in with her and I thought nothing of it because she had a habit of leaving every group chat and Discord server she was in whenever she was in a really low mood. She did come back to a group chat a few hours later just to send a paragraph about how I don’t care enough about them and how she was tired of recommending games for us four to play in. Admittedly, I’m not one to suggest a game since we all had different tastes and I preferred playing by myself most of the time especially after work. Then she left the gc again right as I sent “Fair enough” as a response as I didn’t have the energy to argue and I was confused as to when did I not show that I cared enough. 

Gary then stepped in and brought up a moment that I didn’t remember since it was a few months back, that I wasn’t playing with them as much as I used to anymore, and I was breaking their boundaries by mentioning my ex’s name even though it was just to tell them that he had joined me in a game so they wouldn’t accidentally end up in a game together. I asked why they had a problem with me not playing with them much anymore when he (Gary) doesn’t play that much anymore either since we both got jobs and that I’m too tired from work nowadays to be hearing them vent (mainly Elisa) about the same issues everyday. Gary then sent me TikToks that were all about how you can’t be friends with an ex because it’s not possible to see them as a friend after a relationship. 

Eventually, Elisa came back and kicked me out of every group chat and servers I was in that she owned or had admin in and both Elisa and Gary unfriended me on everything. Stuart never said anything the whole time even though he was likely reading the group chat and has kept me friended which surprises me. My other set of close friends think that I was in the right and that Elisa and Gary were being childish for their expectations since we’re no longer teenagers, but I feel like I could have handled it better.

121,1cziakn,AITA for not adjusting my rent now that a new tenant has moved in?,"Hi all, looking for opinions on how to best move forward - I can see both sides to this. Where I'm feeling like the asshole is that I don't want to make any adjustments to my current routine/expenses.



I've been living in a 3 bed property with 2 friends for 2+ years. During our house search, we each set our respective budgets and looked within those parameters.



The person with the largest budget picked the first room (largest), second largest budget had second pick, and I ended up with the last choice. It's the smallest by a long shot (8sqm compared to 18sqm and 12qm) but it has an attached half bath (toilet & sink, we share a shower/bath - nb, the total sqm w the half-bath included is 10sqm).



We split the rent at 37% for the largest room, 33% for the mid-sized room, and 30% for my room.



In May, the roommate with the largest room moved out and we found a replacement tenant with the rent advertised at the rate that was being paid.



Now my other longstanding roommate will be moving out. We prepared the advert for her room, and a convo about the current split was brought up by the newest tenant. Fair to query, as we hadn't until this point needed to mention what the other two rooms were going for. I explained how it was initially decided amongst us, and that I hadn't intended to re-evaluate my room based on the circumstances of others incoming/outgoing.



The new tenant has come back to propose splitting the rent at 35.5% for the largest room, 31.5% for the mid-size room, and 33% for my room, on the basis it has a half-bath (which works out to be -£40, -£20, +£60).



I understand where she's coming from, and I appreciate a mentality that seeks out fairness; however, for me, this isn't possible. I've already had a rental increase at the beginning of the year when we originally re-signed our contract. Tacking on an additional expense because that's what the new tenant views as fair would mean an overall 20% increase to my living expenses compared to last year.



I asked if she would want the mid-sized room as it's currently priced (which is less £100 than the room she signed on for), but she said she needs the extra space. She hasn't suggested I move into the room she's viewing as least valuable now, but if that was suggested, I would decline. I've been here for 2+ years now and I've cultivated the room so that it feels definitively like /my/ space.



And all this being said, the largest room at it's current rate is still significantly below market rate for the size of the bedroom, location, and the scale of the other communal spaces (which are all fully furnished not by her). Finally, it was advertised as a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom houseshare, so I'm just not seeing the issue beyond a touch of 'buyers remorse' that's been spurred on through due to comparison.

122,1czhmyt,AITA for telling MIL she's a guest?,"My (33F) MIL (67F) lives in another country with her husband. We never got along because she always insists on being the one to make the rules and is overall very controlling. She also disliked me from the start for merely existing. We don't see her very often thankfully but whenever we do it's always pretty stressful.  

She is visiting now and staying with us. It's been a week. Normally my husband deals with her shit but he's currently travelling for work and won't be back until tonight. Since my husband left she's been HORRIBLE. It's like she's trying to get on my nerves on purpose. I try to keep calm because I know she'll leave in 2 weeks and I won't see her for months again. However, there's been an incident that me and my husband are now fighting about.  

My toddler brought a large toy truck to the table. I reminded him 'no toys when we're eating, please put it back in the toy box and you can play with it when you're done eating'. My toddler was compliant but as he was getting off the chair MIL said 'it's ok honey, grandma allows it, your mommy is no fun, isn't she?'. This is not an isolated incident, she's been trying to undermine my parenting ever since my husband left for work (trying to let the kids eat sweets instead of dinner, telling them they can do things I just told them they were not allowed and so on).  

I could not take it anymore and said 'let's not forget grandma is but a guest here. Guests don't make the rules, do they? I'm sure grandma knows who this apartment belongs to. And hotels are so expensive in this area'. I admit my tone was mocking and I was referring to the fact that I alone own our home (I inherited it from grandpa). She was red and called me disrespectful but did not escalate it any further.  

The same evening my husband is calling me furious, asking how dare I tell his mother she's not welcome here. I told him full story and he was still pissed, claiming I should have handled it better and keep peace. He said he can't even leave for a few days without us getting in a fight in front of the kids. I told him why don't you say that to your mother. I also told him this is the last time I'm allowing her to stay over. She can live in a hotel or not come at all for all I care if she has to act like this. I refuse to feel so uncomfortable in my own home.  

I also told him I'm going to my parents' lake house this weekend because the weather is so nice and I want to relax. However, MIL is not welcome to join. He has 3 options: go with us, try to convince the kids to stay home with him and MIL so that I could go alone or I go with the kids and he stays with MIL. He told me it's very rude not to invite MIL.

When I was filling out the information at the front desk, I was stuck on the address part. The address part of the form didn’t specify [block] [street] etc, just had a bunch of blank lines. I was basically half-conscious at the time and was panicking because I didn’t know what order to write the address and was (irrationally) afraid that it might get rejected if I put in the wrong order.

 I went to ask my aunt for help and sat next to her on the clinic chairs. She looked over and asked incredulously “You don’t know our address?” I was embarrassed because I know this should be common knowledge for everyone and didn’t respond. She asked in a even more louder and incredulous tone “uh- puh? You *actually* don’t know?”

 At this point, I was even more embarrassed because people were looking. I also started to feel a sense of “are you really doing this rn?” So i clamped up even more and searched on google for the formal order of addresses. After I gave back the form and sat down. She half whispered, half yelled on how rude I was being and I shouldn’t ignore people when they’re talking to me. I exploded on the inside because like wtf? But I also felt awful because how belittling she was being because I know the address I just needed a little help. I didn’t express any of that, I just looked at the floor.

I just want to know how to de-escalate the situation for future references because I can’t move out any time soon.

124,1czh26n,AITA for not charging my mom more rent?,"I always had a rule of not doing business with family. But my mom was getting older and wanted to move out of her colder, more expensive state. I had an extra house that I was renting, and she asked if she could move in and be my renter instead. The thought of being my mom's landlord sounded terrible, but I also felt like it was the least I could do because she sacrificed a lot for me growing up.

I obviously did not want to fleece my mom that is on a mostly fixed income. So I gave her a price about $200 above the mortgage.

Now, here's where it starts getting tricky. Over the five years, I've only raised rent once by $100. And the margin between rent and mortgage has been eaten up by lawncare, various yearly taxes, home warranty, etc.

However, my mom has also spent a lot of her money fixing and taking care of the house. She had multiple rooms repainted, the outside deck restored, light fixtures replaced, and the entire downstairs floor replaced with LVP ""hardwood"".

That brings us to last week. Taxes went up this year, and rent almost exactly matches the mortgage. Which means I'm eating everything else (approx $125/mo). My wife hardly pays attention to the finances, but I figured I should let her know the situation.

My wife said you need to raise the rent. She was upset that any repairs (it's a 22/yr old house) would now come out of our pocket. She pointed out that my mom was still working (substitute teacher), and that she has paid for a trip this year to France to see the Olympics.

I countered that we make over $320k/yr in a moderate cost area, so we can easily absorb the cost. I also pointed out that my mom is spending a lot of her own money improving the house. And we have over $300k of equity in that house, so we could use a HELOC for major repairs.

After discussion, I agreed to raise the rent a little, but to wait until next year so that my mom has 1 year to adjust her finances as necessary.

All good right? Nope. We are at my mom's (my?) house during Mother's Day. She mentions that she hates the appliances and that she plans on replacing them during the labor day sales. I figure, if she wants to spend her own money replacing perfectly good appliances, go for it. It will only increase the value of the house.

We get home, and my wife is irate. She says that if my mom has money to replace appliances, I should not feel guilty about raising the rent now. I tried explaining how it was economically beneficial to have my mom pay down the mortgage while improving the house for basically free. But my wife would not let me get a word in. This caused a really big fight, and I'm still a little hurt at how angry my wife was at me.

In the end, I think it's a complete win-win situation and it lets me help my mom. My wife disagrees. AITA",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for not charging my mom more rent?

I was already pretty sure she was telling people stuff about me because she tells me everyone else's business but today a colleague told me to make sure I invite her to my wedding, so I think me making a joke about marrying my boyfriend for a visa (I'd not do that, I'd only marry him because I love him) means she's now telling colleagues I am about to get married.

I live in a country with INCREDIBLY strong defamation laws. It doesn't even matter of the thing being said is true if it can cause damage to my reputation or career. 

Now she's probably already defamed me by the laws of my country but I'm so tempted to go one further. Before I realised she did this stuff I had added her back on Instagram close friends and she was the first to click on any close friends story. Now I'm super tempted to make a close friends story with only her seeing it saying I got married or that I'm pregnant to have proof that she has been spreading gossip about me.

She's young and will hopefully grow out of this habit, but she was heavily implying another colleague was having an affair and I do think she is skating on thin ice anyway given the defamation laws here. 

If I do a ""Wagatha Christie"", and she did indeed tell everyone at work, and I then sued her for defamation she'd be at risk of being deported.

127,1czfvxg,AITA for separating my finances from my husband because he won't quit giving his parents money? ,"Me and my husband have been together for over nine years and separating our finances never occurred to me until this past year. 

I'm the saver and he's the spender. In the beginning it didn't bother me because we had two incomes and wasn't rich but lived comfortably. 

His family has always ""borrowed"" money from us but rarely ever pay that money back. I personally don't lend money not even to family but I do not stop him from lending to his. 

A few years ago my husband was in a bad car wreck and can no longer work so I became the sole breadwinner. He now gets disability but that was a four year process. In that time we dwindled our savings to nothing and came close to losing everything. Our debt mounted and there was nothing I could do. 

When he received his back pay I only asked him to pay off his vehicle a loan in which I've paid over 50 grand on in the last few years and put some in savings. 

He did neither. Instead he blew the money. Loaning over 10 grand to his family and paying nothing towards the debt we created. 

During this time I was able to save some money from my paycheck but not much and had plans to pay some debts off once I have enough saved. He knew I was saving to do this. 

About a month ago I noticed over 700 missing out our savings and I asked him what happened!?! He replied with I loaned it to my parents. I asked when he was going to receive it back because that money was already spent and I needed it. He said I don't know when they can afford to. 

I blew up an lost my shit. He didn't ask me, we didn't speak about it. He did it behind my back because he knew it would piss me off and I would say no if he asked. We had a huge fight. I figured after that fight he would stop. But no... 

Yesterday I checked my account and another thousand dollars was gone. Gone where u ask? He gave it his parents. I'm so mad I see red. 

I flat out told him that as of today I'm done with his parents. I'll pay half the household bills buy our food and that's it. If he wants to lend all his disability to them fine but I'm not gonna go bust my ass 60 hours a week so he can keep giving our money away. 

So AITA for going to the bank and withdrawing all the money I put there and opening a new account he don't have access to?

We had similar classes and slowly became closer as the year went on. By the end of our freshman year, we were hanging out every weekend (in groups and 1v1) and she had become a pretty big part of my life at school. She had even gone to California with me to stay with my aunt during spring break. All was going well with just little things here and there that would annoy me, but that is true with most friendships. It wasn't until May of our freshman year that things began getting tense between us.

Our mutual friend (Kylie) was having a birthday and we were planning how we wanted to celebrate. Kylie wanted to make piña coladas and we were just going to a friends house to have cake and dance and generally enjoy each others company bc things were stressful around that time (midterms) and our schools music festival was also that weekend. After asking Kylie what she wanted to drink/eat on her birthday, I then took it upon myself to ask everyone how much they were planning on drinking and whether they were wanting virgins or alcoholic beverages. This was simply so I would know how much of each ingredient to buy (we were broke and don't have room to just stock up).

When I messaged my friends, it was an easy conversation and no one was planning on having more than 3 drinks because we all had to study/we would be drinking the following day during the music festival. However, when asking Steph, she initially said 2-3 drink for her and asked how much I planned on drinking. I told her that I would prob also only have 2-3 drinks.

I thought that was the end of the conversation, but then she messaged me again asking that we all don't drink too much at the party. I told her that no one was planning on drinking a lot simply 1-3 drinks, but I wasn't sure about our friend Kylie bc it was her bday. I told her that, since it was Kylie's bday, I didn't think that it was fair to put a limit on her.

Again she said okay. 10 minutes later she messaged that she actually wasn't going to drink at all that night bc when she drinks she has really bad hangovers (potentially due to medication she is on). I told her that's fine, and that we'll still have the virgins so everyone can enjoy even if they don't want to drink alcohol.

131,1czfbzq,AITA For not visiting my Grandfather in the hospital?,"My (20f) Grandfather (87m) very recently fell unconscious and was taken to the hospital. His heart stopped for 3 minutes at some point but was able to be revived. He has now gone through surgery and is stable.  
I was the one who called 911 and rode in the ambulance with him to the hospital.

For some context; I was living with and was raised by my grandparents for 20 years. They spoiled and coddled me during those years so I have just recently been learning the responsibilities of being an adult. I moved out to live with my Boyfriend and his family for a few months. We then decided to move back in with my Grandparents so I can help take care of them. We spent the past few weeks cleaning and organizing the basement so we can move in. We used our own funds to pay for cleaning supplies and new appliances.

After arriving at the hospital I waited hours to see my Grandfather again and when I did he was sedated and intubated. My Aunt arrived and so did my Uncle soon after, I decided to leave and let them handle the situation since I had no idea what I was doing. The day after I had to be at home to help receive and build furniture for the basement. While waiting my Uncle suddenly texted me saying I needed to be at the hospital to stay by my Grandpa's side since he was busy and my Grandpa needed someone there. I told him I couldn't as I was busy that day and I needed to do things at the house. He replied that none of my plans mattered unless it was a job interview. He told me if I didn't come then I should move out since I wasn't ""taking care of my grandpa if I'm not going to be there"" and that I can leave when he comes back from work.

The day after that my Boyfriend and I went to his family's home to do some laundry and to prep for a previously planned trip. This trip was planned months before any of this was happening. We planned on being gone for a single day and after the trip I was going to stay with my Grandpa at the hospital. While at the home however, I received a text from my Uncle telling me to be at the hospital the day at the trip from 8AM-6PM, since he's busy with work and my Grandpa just came out of surgery. I told him I couldn't and explained what I had planned, he said he didn't care and that they can be cancelled. We argued for a bit and he threatened to have me moved out of the house if I didn't come to the hospital. My grandpa is the one who owns the house, not him.

I discussed things with my Boyfriend and we decided to tell his family and head home. They were very understanding of the situation. I feel frustrated that my plans have been cast to the side and discarded due to the situation and how stressful these past few weeks have been. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA For not visiting my Grandfather in the hospital? My (20f) Grandfather (87m) very recently fell unconscious and was taken to the hospital. His heart stopped for 3 minutes at some point but was able to be revived. He has now gone through surgery and is stable.  
I was the one who called 911 and rode in the ambulance with him to the hospital.

For some context; I was living with and was raised by my grandparents for 20 years. They spoiled and coddled me during those years so I have just recently been learning the responsibilities of being an adult. I moved out to live with my Boyfriend and his family for a few months. We then decided to move back in with my Grandparents so I can help take care of them. We spent the past few weeks cleaning and organizing the basement so we can move in. We used our own funds to pay for cleaning supplies and new appliances.

After arriving at the hospital I waited hours to see my Grandfather again and when I did he was sedated and intubated. My Aunt arrived and so did my Uncle soon after, I decided to leave and let them handle the situation since I had no idea what I was doing. The day after I had to be at home to help receive and build furniture for the basement. While waiting my Uncle suddenly texted me saying I needed to be at the hospital to stay by my Grandpa's side since he was busy and my Grandpa needed someone there. I told him I couldn't as I was busy that day and I needed to do things at the house. He replied that none of my plans mattered unless it was a job interview. He told me if I didn't come then I should move out since I wasn't ""taking care of my grandpa if I'm not going to be there"" and that I can leave when he comes back from work.

The day after that my Boyfriend and I went to his family's home to do some laundry and to prep for a previously planned trip. This trip was planned months before any of this was happening. We planned on being gone for a single day and after the trip I was going to stay with my Grandpa at the hospital.

132,1czf98e,AITA for wanting my husband to pick sides regarding his toxic parents? ,"I've spent many many years supporting my husband's desire to be closer to his parents (60's, wealthy, judgmental, very narcissistic - his words). For 3 years I spent every 3 day weekend, every holiday doing a 10 hour round trip to their house. They'd often have plans of their own and act like us being in their house was a vacation. I had to console him after each trip as they didn't spend time with him, told him he was too sensitive, overreacting, and needed ""to cry to his shrink that they put his diapers on wrong"" when he tried to discuss how sad he was at their lack of connection. Over the years he got increasingly more upset and hurt by them each time - we decided enough was enough. We'd lessen our trips. We invited them to OUR house for X-mas, a year in advance. Six months before they told us they would not be able to find a dog sitter, and that we should instead go to them (we have 2 cats). Throughout these years they have also made many passive aggressive or blatantly rude comments to me (I grew up very poor).

133,1czf5g0,AITA for telling my friend I don't want her painting?,"This happened 10 days ago and it's still not resolved so I wanted to get some outside opinion. I have a friend who is a painter and is amazing at it. She was doing it as a hobby but switched to full time two years ago. When she first started out I bought a small painting to support her, but overall her paintings aren't really my style (but I don't mind). 

Two years ago she painted me a small portrait of myself for my birthday, which I happily hung in my apartment, next to the painting I bought. That same year for Christmas I got another painting from her, but I don't have space to hang so I stored it into my closet space. Last year she made a painting that she thought I would really like (and I did!) so she gifted that to me as well. And then again, this year for Easter I got another small painting from her. 

Since my birthday is coming up, my friends have been asking me what I want, but I really couldn't think of anything so I said we'll go for dinner. During the talk about the gift, said painter friend said ""Of course, I'll paint you something"" to which I said ""I'm sorry, but I don't want another painting"". I could see that I hurt her in that moment so I said ""I really don't have space in my apartment to hang it"". One of my friends suggested to help me move some stuff around for the paintings, but (and here is the moment I may have been an asshole) I said ""Even if I do make some space, I just don't want another painting for my birthday"".

I live in a very small rental apartment and I can't squeeze all the paintings on the two walls I have. The rest of the walls are occupied with shelves. After that conversation some of our friends told me that I should've just accepted the painting, since she really loves how we support her. I told them, again, that I don't need another painting and that I don't have enough storage place in my apt. for them to which one friend replied that I don't appreciate her work enough.

I can see their reasoning to support her and she really likes to paint for us, but I'm not the type of person to collect (or hang) the painting, it's just not my thing. AITA?

134,1czeqnp,AITA for expressing I wanted my friend to be at my baby shower.,"Heres the communication, AMITA?

I received this text two days before the shower, invites have been out for 1.5 months & it’s an intimate (<20) gathering. I care about her a lot that’s why I’m disappointed. She’s also asked me to work on expressing my feelings more as a friend vs bottling up (my normal tendency) so I was also trying to do that. 

Hey Laura, I had a mommy makeover this week and I am recovering right now. I was hoping to be able to make it to your shower but depending on how I feel, I might not be able to go. I’ll let you know by tomorrow evening. 

Response: Hey Ellen, Thanks for letting me know. I hope your recovery is going smoothly. I understand if you can't make it, but I'm feeling a bit disappointed, especially since this is our first child and it meant a lot to me to have you there. I wish I had known sooner, but I completely understand your situation. I'll wait to hear back tomorrow. Rest up, and we'll catch up soon.

Response: Hi Laura, I had this booked back in January so I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be able to make it to your shower. I said yes thinking I might be able to go if I wasn't that sore. I don't feel it is my responsibility to tell you anything about a personal choice I made. I was so extremely nervous, I didn't want didn't want anyone to know outside my immediate family. I told you the day after my surgery as a courtesy as I knew I most likely won't be able to go given the level of discomfort I am in.
To be honest I'm not really happy with your response. It feels a bit selfish. Like you only care about your shower and what's going on with you and not me.

I tried to call Ellen and then texted saying I tried to call and if we can talk when they have a moment & the response was I’d rather not, I’m on pain medication & trying to rest.

Response: Good morning, Ellen. How are you doing today? I really hope you’re feeling a bit better.

I’m truly sorry if my message upset you. That wasn't my intention at all. I care about you deeply and was just trying to express how much your presence means to me.

I’ll be leaving a care package at your front door to hopefully brighten your day and help with your recovery. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you.

When you’re feeling up for it, I’d love to chat and make things right between us.

135,1czepzv,AITA for not apologizing about making a joke about mental health?,"One of my best friends has been seeing my ex-gf off and on the last few weeks. I asked how they happened to meet and was surprised to find out he met her at the psych ward while working his late-night security guard shift there. She asked if he could take her back to his place, and he agreed, they had what he thought was a one-night stand. A few weeks have passed and it has been anything but a one-night stand. My friend lives in a house with all 3 other friends, and she met my other friend who lives with his gf in the basement. She hit it off with my other friend's gf, and has been coming over every day since.

My friend has made it clear that he doesn't want a relationship, but that hasn't stopped him from sleeping with her almost every night. She has grown comfortable with my friend group and has been spending a lot of time with us. The other night, all of our friends were having a bonfire at the house. My ex and friend were there when I noticed she stormed off, looking very upset.

""She's probably not going to be talking to me for a long time."" My friend says, looking at me. My friend group has a very dark and edgy sense of humor that a lot of people would find offensive. Nobody is trying to make light of serious issues, but it's more of a coping mechanism that helps find a little bit of light in otherwise dark areas of life. He made a joke about her mental health that struck the wrong cord. She threw a fit, she was pissed off, and acted very rude towards my friend. She left and he seemed to be feeling down about it. Now I know my audience and I would have never made this joke to her directly, but she was already gone by this point, and I just wanted to lighten the mood.

""Well, if she keeps up the bad attitude, why don't you tell her you can drop her right back off at the psych ward where you found her?"" I said. Everybody laughs a little and the night goes on.

I forgot about the whole thing until a few days ago when I noticed she had sent me a paragraph demanding that I apologize too. She had a conversation about the joke my friend (the one sleeping with her) made. He apologized to her profusely and all seemed to be well. But for some reason, my other friend was present and he told her about the joke that I made. She didn't think it was funny and let me know about it.

I told her that while I was sorry about her mental health struggles, she wouldn't be getting an apology out of me. She told me nobody thought my joke was funny and it made everybody uncomfortable. I've talked to everybody else and they said that's not true. I told her that what I said wasn't out of line, she was acting rude, and I wouldn't apologize especially since I was doing what I thought was the right thing.

Anne is heavily into victorian-goth aesthetic (tombstones, corsets, ravens, gloomy mansions etc.) so for her party I made her a tombstone cake - a cake in the shape of tombstone decorated with roses and cobwebs with text ""here lies your youth"".

Anne herself LOVED the cake and was overjoyed. However, it turned out that one of her close friends' (Mike) dad died few weeks before the party. I didn't know it, as while I know the guy, I'm not close with him and my sister didn't mention anything about it. When Mike had seen the cake he got pretty upset and was in a bad mood for the rest of the party. Which is pretty understandable.

Mike himself didn't say anything about it but later some of our mutual friends reached to me saying that I was callous and I shouldn't make a cake like that, as it may upset people with deceased loved ones. 

Obviously, I hadn't thought about it and only wanted to accomodate the cake to my sister's interests. But I start to think that maybe I should make more traditional cake for the party and give Anne a smaller one or tombstone cupcakes/cookies as a gift, in private.

Obviously, I hadn't thought about it and only wanted to accomodate the cake to my sister's interests. But I start to think that maybe I should make more traditional cake for the party and give Anne a smaller one or tombstone cupcakes/cookies as a gift, in private.

My and my gf often have heated arguments because I am not ""empathetic"" (as she says) enough.

Some examples:

1. For a bit of context, we live in different cities, 4 hours away, until mid summer. She wants me to come to her highschool graduation day and I agreed after some ""please please please"" moments. The day I asked why is it so important to her, she wanted to take a break from relationship. I thought it could be another reason, not because it is a special day. Everyone graduates highschool (except very poor rural children or special cases) so it was no biggie when I finished it.
2. She wanted to buy a skin which was available 24h in a shooter game, but didn't have enough money on her card. It was a quite expensive skin but I saw that she wanted it a lot. I didn't have a problem with her spending that amount of money on a weapon that she doesn't even use so often. Offered myself to buy it from my card, but wanted the money back. She was upset the entire day for me asking the money back and said I shouldn't have offered in the first place to LEND money. ""Offer to buy it for me or do not say anything at all"".
3. She told me months ago that she really wants X pretty cheap cosmetic item, but she can't find it in her city. Everytime she buys it, she has to pay transport fees. Told me that if I find it, I should buy her some of that product and she is WILLING TO PAY for them. Later, I found that item in my city, called her to ask how many did she want, answer was 2. So I bought her 3, the third one was on me and said and i bought them ""ok so total for 2 is this sum and the third one is a gift from me"". Again I was called for being cheap.
4. A game my friends and I were waiting for a loooong time (8 years) was launched on steam. In that evening, I told her to give me ""the whole evening"" with my friends to play it. Launch day happened to be the same as her first period day. I played with my friends until 11 pm and still wanted to play, but she called me to cry about me not being ""empathic"" for staying to my friends whole evening, despite that I knew about her period timing.

Context on the money situations: She buys me expensive gifts, even if I told her not to, mostly plushies (i like them, but at this moment I have too many) and decorative stuff. She said that she just wants to show how much she cares about me. We play together coop video games and often I pay for the games we want to play for both of us (not as expensive as her gifts tho). Also, I started to pay for our meals when we go out together. I work for my money, she receives it from parents. And they are way richer than my mom who is single since I was 8 (and father not paying anything for me since then).

We've known each other since 9th grade and got closer towards the end of it. I really enjoy spending time with her and all, but her behaviour really frustrates me

I get sick a lot, and by that I mean A LOT. Like twice in 3 months. Usually I take a holiday for a week to recover. And most of these are allergic reactions to dust that I have since the place I live in is very dusty. My friend was initially okay with this, she'd joke about it and all, and it was fine

Soon she started throwing literal tantrums and being mad at me for days just because I took these frequent leaves. She'd text me saying 'I always do this' or that 'I should just stay at home and not come to school if I always am like this' or refuse to talk to me in class.

Like initially I felt bad, especially since one time it was her birthday, and I promised her I'd be there at school to go distribute sweets to the teachers. But it sort of slipped my mind and I ended up forgetting it and stayed home to prepare for an upcoming competitive exam. She wouldn't talk to me for days, and I apologized to her a lot for it and she forgave me in the end

I had my last straw today when I told her I couldn't come to school because yesterday night I had tripped down the stairs and fallen while coming back from the doctors for having symptoms for the flu. I've got a major sprain, a couple of bruises and one of my toenails even fell off.

I told her this today, and she was pissed again, she just cut me off in the middle while texting and refused to even hear what happened to me. She just blocked me directly.

It really pisses me off because I don't get why she's so clingy when she even has her own set of friends. Even more than me actually. I don't act like this when she takes holidays. So why is she acting like this?

We agreed she would never work, and I wouldn't ask her to either.

In the first two years of our marriage, we didn't have kids. I worked from 8 am-6 pm. Sometimes she'd wake up and make me breakfast, sometimes she wouldn't. I didn't mind because we were early in our marriage. On days she made breakfast, she would also pack me lunch. On days she didn’t wake up early, I would eat both breakfast and lunch at work. She would wake up around 12-2 pm, do household chores, and wait for me to come home. We would have dinner together and spend time going out for movies, dinners, or visiting friends, at least twice a week.

This year, we had a baby. I took one month of leave to help her, which is the maximum my job allows. State leave was an option, because the subsidized pay wouldn't cover our bills. After my leave, her parents stayed with us for two months, helping with the baby. I supported all the household bills during this time. After they left, our baby was three months old, and this is when issues began.

145,1czdlrl,AITA for leaving for choosing my dreams over love?,"I (23M) am leaving for a master's degree abroad in January. I had a girlfriend of two years with whom I planned to study together, but she didn’t pass her TOEFL or complete her portfolio on time, despite my reminders. After she missed the deadlines, I applied to a prestigious program and was accepted.

Initially, I focused on working for a year in our country, thinking we'd apply together next year. When I got the acceptance letter, we were both excited. Though unsure about leaving, my parents insisted, wanting the best for me. Trusting their judgment, I agreed to go and promised my girlfriend I'd wait for her in the new country.

Days later, she started ranting that she didn’t like the university I got into and would never go there. This made me sad, but I thought she was being impulsive. Soon after, she decided she wanted to go to Europe for her master’s degree. I agreed to join her after finishing my degree, planning to either pursue another degree or find work there.

However, she became angry, saying she didn’t want a long-distance relationship and wanted me to stay. I couldn't stay because everything was set for my master's degree. She then said the relationship wouldn't work and she wouldn’t go to Europe either, as she loved her country and wouldn’t leave her family. She insisted I either live with her now or come back immediately after my degree. Returning wasn’t a viable option due to limited opportunities and poor salaries.

I (23M) am leaving for a master's degree abroad in January. I had a girlfriend of two years with whom I planned to study together, but she didn’t pass her TOEFL or complete her portfolio on time, despite my reminders. After she missed the deadlines, I applied to a prestigious program and was accepted.

Initially, I focused on working for a year in our country, thinking we'd apply together next year. When I got the acceptance letter, we were both excited. Though unsure about leaving, my parents insisted, wanting the best for me. Trusting their judgment, I agreed to go and promised my girlfriend I'd wait for her in the new country.

Days later, she started ranting that she didn’t like the university I got into and would never go there. This made me sad, but I thought she was being impulsive. Soon after, she decided she wanted to go to Europe for her master’s degree. I agreed to join her after finishing my degree, planning to either pursue another degree or find work there.

However, she became angry, saying she didn’t want a long-distance relationship and wanted me to stay. I couldn't stay because everything was set for my master's degree. She then said the relationship wouldn't work and she wouldn’t go to Europe either, as she loved her country and wouldn’t leave her family. She insisted I either live with her now or come back immediately after my degree. Returning wasn’t a viable option due to limited opportunities and poor salaries.

TW: religion, mental disorders, family issues.

Here's the thing, I (M24) live with my parents (M55 and F61) and my sister (F21). There is no way to sugar coat this so i will just say it: my family is made of catholic cultists. Not the wear black robes and sing in the forest cultists but the I would choose God and/or my church over any one of you if given the chance. So naturally I'm an atheist with severe religious trauma, add that to a severe anxiety and sleep disorders plus a little bit of queerness and you'll get that I'm not exactly fit with the whole family. 

Don't get me wrong tho, i love my parents and i'm convinced they love me; but when i started going to therapy and psychiatric treatements i didn't count on their help bc their reasoning was ""is all in your head, you should pray more""

So yeah. 

With this in mind, last week i had to make a HUGE payment on something academic and didn't have enough left for my meds, i tried convincing my parents on lending me some money but that was quickly denied. So i went on a streak of no meds and in my desperation i started scouting the house on what to buy to get them. 

And there it was in all its glory: a crucifix. It wasn't the prettiest or the biggest in the house (we have like 26, i counted them) and went on Facebook Marketplace. I kinda scammed the person who bought it from me (on that i know i'm an asshole) but my parents still havent figured that one crucifix is missing.

Now I'm starting to feel a little like shit abt it so i gotta ask, AITA??",Asshole,2024-05-24,"AITA for selling my parent's crucifix for my meds

147,1czd8zi,AITA for telling my mom to be careful with her words?,"Hi guys me (22f) and my mom (51f) have gotten into an argument just now about my mom’s word choice when talking about my dad (49M). For as long as I can remember my parents have been separated. My mom started to tell me about her relationship with my dad from a very young age. He was terribly verbally and emotionally abusive. She always claims that she’s “gotten over it” but she doesn’t have to and I understand her disgust for him. I can see how strong my mom is and how two things can be true at once, he is my dad and I’ve never seen that side of him but he has also done disgusting things that I can never excuse. 

My dad has changed a lot since then, he has a family which I adore, but he is also enduring kidney failure. He gets dialysis multiple times a week and his appearance has changed rapidly in the last year. It puts so much fear in my heart, It’s starts a discussion within myself about my parents mortality that I’m not ready to face. Today my mom came home and the first thing she said was, “Did you see your dad at your cousins birthday party??” (I hadn’t gone) she continues , ”My jaw dropped when I saw him! He looks like Barry White before he died!” It scared me pretty bad. I mostly text my dad because he lives 2 hours away and haven’t seen him.

 I tried to tell her “be careful mom” and she immediately got irritated with me. She went on about how I’m so sensitive and how she didn’t say anything wrong and I just asked “if I was anyone else would you think saying that is okay?” she rolls her eyes and mumbles something about everything she’s been through (which I acknowledge and talk about with her all the time) I continue “you don’t see how comparing my dad to Barry White before he died and saying he looks terrible might be dark?” And she kicked me out saying I’m being sensitive and slammed the door. She never even closes her door so this was more symbolic to me. So what do you guys think? Am I the asshole for asking my mom to change her language?

Additional info:

This post is not to debate my relationship with my dad. If I disconnected with everyone in my family who had abused someone else, I would have no family left.

148,1czcvsm,AITA for letting the bank take grandmas house ,"I (30F) lost my great grandma (89) in December of 2023.  Amy is Grandmas daughter

In 2019 I moved in to help. We had always gotten along well. She relied pretty heavy on a walker to get around, and needed help with cooking and cleaning. I had been working a full time and starting to burn out. Enter Covid. My brother (31) was out of work. We decided he would move and help

B really dove in and we managed for a while

2022 and my G is in a wheelchair. She needs help in and out of bed, on and off the toilet, she wasn't even able to lift her arms high enough to brush her hair. B and I have tried to have conversations with A about getting my G into a nursing home. We were shut down.

G was not rich, but did own her home and was always  good with money. A had a lot of influence over her, when I would talk to her about selling her house she would say ""well I'm suppose to leave it for A"" We don’t have medical training and it was starting to be to much. Late 2022 B had to leave. He needed somewhere with more job opportunities. We also hoped this would force A hand.

For the first few months A and my G sons wife Cassie were alternating s2 weeks with her. My G now spent all day sitting in the chair. I would help her to bathroom on my lunch. A would help her with showers but was often snappy and harsh. After 4 months C stopped coming. G spoke often of wanting to die and we should just put her out of her misery. A relied on me more. Soon I was getting calls in the middle of the night

Months later she was taken to the ER. For a few days they couldn't figure out why she wasn't waking up. Medically there was no reason to keep her there so they began to pressing A to provide the information needed to transfer to a nursing home. A told me that they were moving my G to a ""hospice wing"" but the social worker at the hospital called me and told me that none of that was true. There was no ""hospice"" wing and that A was being uncooperative and that she had spoke with the nursing home and there had been no inquiries into getting her in.

I was prepared to try and get APS involved and try and get a case of elder abuse opened. Then my grandma went from ""unresponsive"" to the ""active dying"". 2 later she passed quietly with me sitting in her room playing her some Johnny Cash

G left a holographic will and did not appoint a personal representative. She left me her moms bedroom set. When if I asked when I could move it A told me I couldn't have it and she was giving it to her son.

A sent out a petition to appoint herself as personal representative. Since I was named in the will I have to sign a renunciation of rights, and a receipt of property but I didn't get it.

She's been coming into my work , calling non stop, harassing me to sign the papers. She saying they are running out of money and the bank is going to take the house.

Is it more of a disgrace to my G memory to fight her?

149,1czcv6c,AITA Cat & Friend Drama,"AITA? 13 months ago a friend became homeless and was torn about re-homing his 2 cats. Since it was thought to be only a few month, I offered to house the 2 cats until he got a new place. It's been 13 months and only now possibly getting a place. During that time my daughter paid to get his female fixed since I had a male with retained testicle which meant there would have been a possibility for mating (NO THANK YOU). The same cat was 2 and never had shots so we had to do that so we could fix her. His other cat was fixed but behind on shots, we took care of that too. Wanted to protect my 2 cats. The plan was  to get paid back when he was back on his feet.

In the past year my teenage son with bipolar and my friend's male cat imprinted on each other so I told our friend that when he gets a place,  he will only have to worry about 1 cat at home since I was keeping his male and  I'd subtract the cost of the his shots from what he owes us (the female never adjusted to a house with a dog rabbit, plus my own 2 cats). Also I provided everything the cats needed (food, litter, nail trims, ect) so he can save to get out of the shelter.

I feel bad and really don't need a 3rd cat but this one calms my son when he's down, sleeps with him, and follows him through the house. The cat even cries when he can't find my son. I'm just looking at the effect letting him take this cat will have on my son & the cat itself. My friend also has bipolar and I told he can look at it like he has a cat when he's at home (whenever that is) and 1 at my house. He sad it was not what was originally stated over a year ago and I can't just keep HIS cat. There is nothing in writing but I do have the vet bills and receipts. I spoke with my son who said he'd be very sad if he had to let the cat go which concerns me do to how depressed he gets (yes he's in therapy) which is why I'm feeling like an ass. 

I understand both my son and friend have mental health issues and this cat means a lot to both of them but the cat has been my son's shadow for 11 of the past 13 months.

I recently fell into a relationship you could say and I’m starting to feel like I’m being used for my place. He was my DoorDash driver and was he was living at his Dads with his step family which he hated. Basically spent all his time away in his car until everyone was asleep. Meets me and starts coming over more and more which is fine. 

Now it’s been 3 months of every day and night being here besides maybe 2 or 3. He uses all the amenities and sometimes ignores my wishes like turn off lights and don’t use the air at this time or running the water for too long. He just rented a room 5 minutes away but still comes over here to “spend time with me” but ends up cooking his food, storing it here, doing his laundry, showering, etc. Wouldn’t really be a problem but now he refuses to “spend any money on me” because “I’m using him”. 

At first it was no dates because that was a waste but he’d help me out by picking things up for me and sometimes I’d pay him back sometimes I wouldn’t. Now he has informed me he will no longer be doing that because he feels like it’s a requirement to spend time with me. Never said it was he offered. I feel like it’s a requirement for him to use everything without contributing anything. He buys paper towels, toilet paper, etc sometimes for my place but I feel like it’s because he knows he needs them when he’s here. Meanwhile he spends so much money in other things. 

I would have to pay my whole rent and utilities even if he wasn’t here so I’m not saying he should be paying a lot but it just doesn’t sit right with me he doesn’t want to do anything to offset the imbalance. Help please I don’t want to ruin something if I am completely in the wrong

UPDATE: Thank you guys so much for the brutal honesty. I commented on some explaining I’ve had some issues with being paranoid so here I am on the internet making sure I’m not overreacting haha. I think I will add one detail as to why I felt the need to post. I haven’t talked to my family and friends about this and am asking strangers because he’s on the sex offender list for something that was a “misunderstanding” so they don’t even know he exists. I consider myself an intelligent person but I’m being naive trying not to hurt another person I barely know. Wish me luck on extraction followed by blocking so he can’t weasel his way back in.

152,1czcgo8,AITA for needing to travel?,"Burner acct.

Anytime I want to have a conversation with my partner about me needing to travel for work or to meet up with friends or to see family, my wife gets really upset and we fight.

For context, I don’t travel often. I’m fully remote for work and over the years. I’ve pretty much stopped hanging out with all of my friends except for one who I see a few times a year. Work is pressuring me to travel in for work monthly, but I push back and travel quarterly at most. Also, I have a newborn that’s 3 months old— and life is definitely hectic right now. So here’s an example of this kind of fight: 

I was asked to travel in for work. I made it clear to my boss that I wouldn’t be able to travel in for the full week, just for a day as I had a newborn at home. I went to talk with my wife, hoping to lock down the date, so I said work is asking me to travel and would a certain date work for her… Obviously thinking we would talk about logistics and how to make this happen. She pretty much snapped at me instantly saying that I wasn’t respecting her and that I came in selfishly demanding things and not asking if this could even work for her. I didn’t see it that way and we agreed to disagree with her requesting that we have a conversation again in a few days and that I ask instead of demand. So fast forward a few days, I found out that I will also need to be travel for another meeting. I went to her and said later today, can we talk about travel for work later in the day, because there’s another travel request on the table. She was clearly annoyed and said “really?? what is it, just get it over with.” So i explained the situation making sure to ask if we could make this work before I commit anything back to work. Same exact explosion. I was being selfish, she would never do this to me, etc. This kind of reaction happens nearly every time unless the trip is her idea. She has told me many times that she thinks I’m weak and give in too easily to others demands whether it’s work or family obligations so she’ll call me pathetic or an idiot, etc.

I truly don’t know what i’m doing wrong. I decline to travel for almost everything throughout the year, so the few times a year i need to travel is for legitimate reasons. Can anybody help explain how I’m the asshole? Can I phrase the ask better? Or is it selfish of me to even think about travel? 

I think i’m developing an anxiety complex around travel. I love her very much and don’t want to put too much strain on her, but at the same time I’m trying to get ahead at work and would like to see friends/family every once in a while without having to risk her being upset.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for needing to travel?

I went to talk with my wife, hoping to lock down the date, so I said work is asking me to travel and would a certain date work for her… Obviously thinking we would talk about logistics and how to make this happen. She pretty much snapped at me instantly saying that I wasn’t respecting her and that I came in selfishly demanding things and not asking if this could even work for her. I didn’t see it that way and we agreed to disagree with her requesting that we have a conversation again in a few days and that I ask instead of demand. So fast forward a few days, I found out that I will also need to be travel for another meeting. I went to her and said later today, can we talk about travel for work later in the day, because there’s another travel request on the table. She was clearly annoyed and said “really?? what is it, just get it over with.” So i explained the situation making sure to ask if we could make this work before I commit anything back to work. Same exact explosion. I was being selfish, she would never do this to me, etc. This kind of reaction happens nearly every time unless the trip is her idea. She has told me many times that she thinks I’m weak and give in too easily to others demands whether it’s work or family obligations so she’ll call me pathetic or an idiot, etc.

I truly don’t know what i’m doing wrong. I decline to travel for almost everything throughout the year, so the few times a year i need to travel is for legitimate reasons. Can anybody help explain how I’m the asshole? Can I phrase the ask better? Or is it selfish of me to even think about travel? 

I think i’m developing an anxiety complex around travel. I love her very much and don’t want to put too much strain on her, but at the same time I’m trying to get ahead at work and would like to see friends/family every once in a while without having to risk her being upset.",0.0,0.026769228279590607,0,1

My husband (M33) and I (F30) have been married for over a year, have kids from previous marriages (SS11, D10). Inlaws moved in with us to our new house last summer because they needed somewhere to live. They always treated D differently and more harshly than SS. They are asian pacific. They pick on D for not following their rules and they were always yelling at her, ignoring her, pushing her away, not including her in activities, etc. I have brought this up to H multiple times and his reasoning is that they use tough love and he turned out fine being raised that way.  
  
Recently I found out MIL has been trying to break up my marriage by telling H to leave me, and that D and I would have no issue moving out because I make enough money. Her reasoning is that H is the most sad he has ever been in a relationship because we fight a lot. Our fighting has been due to him being a new police officer, surviving the academy, disagreements with communication, lying, some other things. He has apologized for every instance, but he did vent to his mom in the beginning of the year that I was considering leaving if things didn't get better with the home and work life.  
  
I confronted MIL by calling her and told her we cannot live together if she is actively trying to break up my marriage and I was upset about the complete disrespect. She didn't say anything on the phone so I hung up. We have been living with avoiding eachother for a month. Last week she was yelling at D for being on the phone with my mom, telling her she isn't allowed to be on the phone downstairs when they are there. I came out of my office (WFH) and told MIL that D is allowed to be on the phone with my mom wherever she wants. MIL told me no. It escalated and turned into a screaming match. I ended up calling MIL a bitch and she called me a whore, claiming this made us even, and this all happened with D next to me freaking out about the whole thing. I told her and FIL they were moving out or I was evicting them. MIL said try me.  
  
H was reluctantly on my side. H didn't want to evict them due to their rental history, didn't want to tell MIL she was overstepping boundaries, nothing. His response was that he can't control her, she is a stubborn woman and with her own opinions. They told him they were having financial issues and needed at least 6 months. I said no. He told them he would give them money to move out. I said no because now we will be financially strapped.  
  
I found out yesterday I'm pregnant and that they are moving out this weekend, and moving down the street.

I have bad anxiety and paranoia. It has gotten worse recently as I am unmedicated for it. But I have been trying to be more open to people as it is hard for me to talk about myself/talk about my feelings. I am a chronic people pleaser and would do anything to make sure the other person is happy and aware they are deeply cared for.

However, being in that relationship brought back how I felt with one my toxic exs. When he got upset he wouldn’t tell me what was bothering him so I would overthink I did something wrong. I would try to get him to talk to me but he just wouldn’t. So I felt like shit because I constantly felt like I was doing something wrong.

I’ve never been in a healthy relationship that lasted more than a month because people don’t like how I constantly feel the need to walk on glass, worried I’d say the wrong thing and lose them altogether.

Anyway, I thought things were going fine. I was heavily mistaken when he out of the blue blocked me on everything. He seemed upset the night before and I asked what was wrong and he didn’t respond. Mind you, when I’d text him (if he wasn’t at work) he’d leave my messages on delivered for hours at a time. 

He had asked me if he could come to see me and he planned the date.

He never told me but since he was working almost everyday I figured he was a full timer.

I am in the process of getting my family owned house. It is located in a tourist destination right off the beach. Since I am not staying in it for the time being I let a local mom live in it so her and her kids had a safe place. She told me she was in a bad situation and in a nasty place. Turns out she wasn’t and just wanted a nicer place, which I get. I told her I would charge her 1200 a month and she wanted someone else to live there too to help with the bills. Well she ended up moving 12 people total and they were bringing animals in and letting them use the bathroom in the house. So I said well it’s gone up to 1800 so I can now save for repairs I will need. They refused and are only sending what they feel like. Now they are refusing to pay utilities. I tried to make a rental agreement, but they refuse to sign or give names for everyone. I got them to sign one with just the original two people and she threw it away and refuses to abide by it. I have also caught them using an old debit card and credit card I had thrown in the trash before I moved out and they moved in. 
So would I be the asshole because I let the utilities shut off and hope they leave? That was the advice I got from an officer that responded to them trying to file harassment charges on me for asking who all is in there because they are ruining the house and I am getting complaints from neighbors.

The officer told them they should leave and that what they are doing isn’t going to work. They were trying to get harassment charges so I can’t contact them about bills or rent payment.

We sent out invitations, but we didn’t invite her best friend, “B.” B and my girlfriend have known each other since elementary school but only became close in the last two years. I also knew B since elementary school, but we never spoke until we ended up in the same college elective. I introduced myself, and we had about five brief and general conversations. She seemed chill and nothing out of the ordinary.

Months later, I started dating my girlfriend. During a conversation, I found out that B had been badmouthing me to her. B didn’t know my girlfriend and I were dating, and my girlfriend felt uncomfortable telling her because of B’s negative comments. According to my girlfriend, whenever I was mentioned, B would make wild assumptions about me, like claiming I was trying to talk to a lot of girls. Every time I was slightly brought up, my girlfriend noticed a shift in B’s tone, making it clear B didn’t particularly like me. This was shocking because, in my brief interactions with B, I had been nothing but respectful, friendly, and polite.

Eight months into our relationship, I urged my girlfriend to tell B that we were dating. B apologized to me, saying she didn’t mean any of it and that she just hates on people for fun. I dismissed her previous behavior, and we all hung out once after that, which went well.

Months later, B asked my girlfriend about marriage and how she and I had probably talked about it. At that stage of our lives, we weren’t thinking about marriage, so my girlfriend gave a general answer like, “We’ve talked a bit about it, but nothing serious yet. We’re so young.” According to my girlfriend, B spent hours insisting that she should give me an ultimatum about marriage, suggesting she should threaten to break up with me if I didn’t commit. My girlfriend tried to change the topic, but B kept discussing it for hours.

Recently, my girlfriend and B had an argument about B’s behavior. While I was giving my girlfriend advice, she received an Instagram message from B with a meme about a girl moving on from her ex, captioned with my name and laughing emojis. This felt like B was mocking our relationship.

Given all this, I told my girlfriend I didn’t want to invite B to our wedding unless she really wanted to. My girlfriend was unsure since B has been her best friend for many years, but she didn’t get mad at me for not sending an invitation to B, so we didn’t. Now, B is bombarding me with messages, demanding to know why she wasn’t invited and making me feel like I’m the bad guy.

Now when it arrived and my bf noticed it, not only he got even more mad over the whole Joost thing, he also accused me of being a lesbian and having an affair with my FEMALE best friend as I decided to match with her instead of him. He threw the biggest tantrum I have ever seen in my life, and threw my Joost Klein mug on the floor, causing it to break. I got so mad at him for breaking my stuff and accusing me of things I have never done and never even thought of doing over a stupid joke.

161,1czbrxr,AITA for suggesting my mom go into a nursing home?,"I'm in my 40s and my parents are in their mid 70s. Mom has dementia and alzheimers. She has been struggling with it for 6 to 7 years now. She grew up in my current home, and they still live behind us in their house.

I've normally had a great relationship with my parents, struggled a bit with my mom as she has some selfish tendencies, and was a little messed up when I was a kid. (Won't go into that.)

But anyway, she fell and broke her hip a few months ago, went into a nursing home for about a month and supposedly got better. She still needs a walker and stumbles without one. 

The problem is with the disease she forgets she needs it and walks without it. She's fallen twice since then. 

For the past few years with the disease she will randomly just wander down to our house and bang on the door screaming/ringing the door bell at all hours of the night. So much so we have deactivated the bell, have cameras now etc. Sometimes she is ok to handle, but other times she just berates me and screams at me for existing it seems. I know it's not her, so I try to take it in stride and get her back home.

But now since she's broken her hip, I really don't want her walking the decently long walk down a hill to our house. Last night she did, she was sick evidently. Made it onto our porch, I sit her down and she starts throwing up everywhere. I call my dad (her husband) to come help, he refuses saying she's being a nag and he's not coming home.

I was TA and just hung up on him bc I was upset. I walked mom back home (with her screaming at me how terrible of a son I was), and got her settled at home. Came back home and sprayed off my porch/cleaned it.

I'm upset with the situation because she was in a nursing home while her hip healed, she was happy, things were ok. But he begged for her to come home, and I feel it's unfair to then leave her alone at home and have me have to deal with these things as they arise. It's always been a fear of hers to go to a nursing home as she gets older, but when she was there she seemed to enjoy the interaction and liked the people when I visited etc.

Today I text to see how she is, and then tell my father I think she really needs to be somewhere permanently because she needs more care than he can provide and he needs to be able to go to his doctors visits/take care of himself (he is fighting cancer), without leaving her alone in her condition. 

I have a super strong sense of duty to them and already felt terrible over not being able to help with something tomorrow due to work, then this happens, and then he responds basically telling me I'm an awful son, all I want to do is throw away my mom, and to not contact them again.

I stayed civil and responded with I'm just trying to start a difficult situation that should have been discussed ages ago before it go to this point. I love them both, and trying to get them both what they need. No response since.

162,1czbqma,AITA for Being a Selfish Daughter to my Mom?,"Hi, I am the eldest daughter of the family and an adult, capable of providing for myself and my direct family. I noticed that my mom has been going out with her friends often. Most of the time, after her office job (she only works once a week) they would hang out and will be home late in the evening (around 8 or 9 PM). I know it's not that late but we were expecting her to bring us food for dinner since she's usually the one who cooks and prepares our food. I can buy our own food which is why sometimes, I ask her if she gets home early or if I should be the one to prepare for dinner. And she would say, don't worry, I will be home in a few and will bring home dinner. 

We usually have our dinner by 6 or 7 at the latest (Dad is home from work during this time already) and she gets home with dinner at 8 PM. And this caused a fight and I felt mad at my mom. I know I should've bought dinner for us in those cases, but oftentimes when I buy food, and she comes home with food, there will be too much for us to eat, so it would become a waste. And we are not rich enough to buy food more than we could eat. 

This has been an issue for I think a year already. My dad sometimes reprimanded my Mom saying that she should come home early because we were waiting for her, and also she didn't inform us where she was and what time she would come home. She would just hang out with her friends (whom she met at work) and spend the evening with them. They sometimes eat out together. Which is why sometimes, I feel like, she can dare to eat out with her friends, while we at home are starving because we are waiting for her to come home with dinner. Sometimes, me and my sister just go out to eat for some snacks, but always wait for her to come home because we know she will be bringing food. 

Am I being selfish if I said to my mom to minimize hanging out with her friends? Because for her, she's happy with them and she likes spending time with them.

Story: my dad got kicked out of his house by his wife because he is an alcoholic, she then put a restraining order on him so he can’t see my brothers nor go to the house for any reason. This happened in early February.

I had my flight back on a Saturday morning (6am) in a neighbouring country. The drive is about 6 hours away from our house with no stops.

I don’t like us driving at night for obvious reasons, and I get super anxious if we don’t give an extra day for emergencies, so i asked if we can leave a day early and leave earlier in the day (around 2 pm). 

Because i have 3 other siblings (ages 10-17), after a morning/midday of yelling and mayhem they were finally ready by 5 pm. We proceeded to stop another 7-8 times, 2 of which were errands for me and the others were bathroom breaks, snack stops, take a scenery picture stops etc etc etc. After nagging them to hurry and stop making so many stops, my mom got angry at me for “not trusting her”. I tried to stay silent but ended up sobbing my eyes out and explaining to everyone why I was upset and anxious. 

I absolutely hate not following a set time plan even if we do have a whole other day ahead to get to the airport and rest at a hotel it just upsets me and i explained this. 

I felt better after crying and started playing games/lightening the mood etc. My two younger siblings apologized for taking so long to get ready, but my mom was silent.

166,1czb6cg,WIBTA for being a coward and not standing up for my new relationship?,"
To make this part of the story short, I (F 22) recently got into a committed relationship with my boyfriend who we’ll call Hank (21 M). I like him a lot and I think we’ll be growing together for a very long time. He’s the sweetest person I’ve ever met, seriously.

So the other day I got to meet two of his friends who were also a couple, who we’ll call Cameron and Sarah. Sarah and Cameron had just started dating a couple weeks prior, and Cameron is Hank’s best friend. Hank planned a romantic dinner for just the two of us, and then planned fireworks for all 4 of us. During fireworks we were all walking around and taking turns talking to eachother. 

I actually liked talking to Sarah, she seemed cool, but for some reason (about 4 times throughout the night) kept bringing up that she thinks me and Cameron would be cute together. Obviously weird, cause that’s her boyfriend. Then she also kept saying that if I hadn’t ’gone for Hank’, she would’ve ’gone for him’ first. At first I thought this was her attempt at joking, so I tried not to take it too seriously. 

However, a day later, me and Hank were on FaceTime and he told me that after I left something happened; right in front of both him and Cameron, Sarah stated that she would have dated Hank if she had met him first. She was completely serious (RIP Cameron, emotional damage). Obviously this made Cameron and Hank very uncomfortable. 

Hank also informed me that when he and Sarah were talking during fireworks, she was trying to convince him to break up with me because she believes I would be a jealous girlfriend who gives ultimatums, which makes no sense because she barely knows me?? And I’m not, lol. Hank told her that he would not be ending things with me and was suspicious of what she was saying. I should also mention that during the time Sarah and I were talking, she was trying to convince me to break up with him because she thought we were too different or something. 

So yah, that’s all super weird, and it’s making everyone feel weird.

Hank told me that he and Cameron are going to try to get another one of their mutual friends involved to see if they can help with the situation at all, get an opinion from an outside party and all that. The situation is a bit delicate considering Cameron really likes Sarah and he wants things to work out. 

Here’s where I hope I’m not being the asshole; I feel like I’m being a coward because I’m not standing up to Sarah about this directly. I’m just being very passive. Granted, Hank did ask me to not confront her about anything just yet, so I’m technically doing what he thinks is best, but I also morally feel like a total coward for just not saying something. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want the drama, and frankly I just met this girl so it’s weird to fight, but it makes me feel bad that I’m not defending my man and his friend.

167,1czb5zu,AITA for Fighting for Custody of Our Dog?,"Fake names for everyone btw.

I (28F) recently went through a rough breakup with my ex, Jake (30M), after five years together. Max is our 4 year old mini poodle that Jake and I got together when he was just a puppy. 

We raised him together, shared responsibilities, and loved him deeply. Max has been with us through thick and thin, providing comfort and joy even during our worst fights. He’s my baby, and I can’t imagine my life without him.

When Jake and I decided to part ways, it was mutual. We both knew we had grown apart, and our goals no longer aligned. But we could not agree on who would get Max.

Jake argues that Max should stay with him because he has a more stable living situation. He owns his home, while I’m currently renting a small apartment. He also works from home, which means he can be with Max all day, whereas I have to go into the office. Jake insists that it’s better for Max’s well-being to stay with him, and he even went as far as to accuse me of being selfish for wanting to keep Max despite my circumstances.

On the other hand, I’ve been Max’s primary caregiver. I’m the one who takes him to the vet, grooms him, and ensures he’s fed and exercised. Jake helped, but it was mostly me handling the day-to-day care. Max is deeply attached to me, and I genuinely believe he would be happier with me, even if it means being in a smaller space and having less time during the workday. Plus, I’ve already arranged for a dog walker to come by during my work hours to make sure Max gets the attention and exercise he needs.

What complicates things further is that Jake’s new girlfriend, Emma (26F), has already started to bond with Max. Jake says it would be easier for Max to adjust because Emma can help take care of him, creating a “family” environment. But I can’t help feeling that Max should stay with the person he’s known the longest and who’s taken the most responsibility for him.

Neither of us are willing to compromise. Jake’s parents are on his side, claiming he’s being more rational and thinking about Max’s best interests. My friends and family support me, arguing that Max should stay with the person he’s most bonded with and who has been his primary caregiver.

Now, I’m considering taking this to court, which feels extreme, but I can’t bear the thought of losing Max. Jake thinks I’m being unreasonable and vindictive, trying to hurt him by taking Max away. He’s even hinted that I’m just doing this out of spite because of our breakup and his new relationship.

AITA ??",No A-holes here,2024-05-24,"AITA for Fighting for Custody of Our Dog? Fake names for everyone btw.

I (28F) recently went through a rough breakup with my ex, Jake (30M), after five years together. Max is our 4 year old mini poodle that Jake and I got together when he was just a puppy. 

We raised him together, shared responsibilities, and loved him deeply. Max has been with us through thick and thin, providing comfort and joy even during our worst fights. He’s my baby, and I can’t imagine my life without him.

When Jake and I decided to part ways, it was mutual. We both knew we had grown apart, and our goals no longer aligned. But we could not agree on who would get Max.

Jake argues that Max should stay with him because he has a more stable living situation. He owns his home, while I’m currently renting a small apartment. He also works from home, which means he can be with Max all day, whereas I have to go into the office. Jake insists that it’s better for Max’s well-being to stay with him, and he even went as far as to accuse me of being selfish for wanting to keep Max despite my circumstances.

On the other hand, I’ve been Max’s primary caregiver. I’m the one who takes him to the vet, grooms him, and ensures he’s fed and exercised. Jake helped, but it was mostly me handling the day-to-day care. Max is deeply attached to me, and I genuinely believe he would be happier with me, even if it means being in a smaller space and having less time during the workday. Plus, I’ve already arranged for a dog walker to come by during my work hours to make sure Max gets the attention and exercise he needs.

What complicates things further is that Jake’s new girlfriend, Emma (26F), has already started to bond with Max. Jake says it would be easier for Max to adjust because Emma can help take care of him, creating a “family” environment. But I can’t help feeling that Max should stay with the person he’s known the longest and who’s taken the most responsibility for him.

These three friends, who I’ll just call Anna, Sarah, and Darcy have seemed like they want nothing to do with me since holiday break. It takes at least five minutes to get a fraction of their attention for asking something as simple as the time and they only seem to want to hang out with themselves in their little group. This especially goes for Anna, who’s sort of the ringleader of the whole group and I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around her, hoping that she’ll like me enough that month so I don’t end up booted from this group who are essentially my only social circle. I tried hanging out with some other friends inside the group, but they would either give me a similar treatment or we would end up meeting back up with one or more of the three mentioned above. I keep trying to find something I’ve done or something I’ve said, but it just seems like they don’t want to be around me any more. I tried asking Anna and Sarah if they had any issues with me and both said no, but continued with their behavior after I expressed my feelings. I never expressed that I wanted them to stop hanging out with each other, or that I expect them to still like me the same way they did at the beginning of the year, I just wanted an answer for why their behavior was different and I didn’t get one. I tried acting like nothing was happening just in case I was making up the behavior, but no, here’s an example of an interaction I had with Sarah. I asked Sarah what classes she was taking next year, no response. I ask again, louder — no response. I ask someone else to ask Sarah, Sarah quickly responds to them before realizing they were asking on my behalf and quickly fading into a monotone voice and a drained expression. I want to confront them about the fact that I spoke to them about this and simply wanted an explanation, one that I was not given, and tell them that their behavior, even if it’s unintentional, makes it so hard to be around them and have even a modicum of self-esteem. I want to express this, but it feels like I’ll just be waiting to go off on them on the last day of school so I never have to see them again and don’t have to deal with the consequences of my actions.

169,1czag4s,AITA for keeping my exe’s phone number,"Hi all. Throwaway for privacy. 

Disclaimers: I discussed making this post with my partner, and will be reading responses together. We love her very much, and I’m sure she has good reasons for responding to this the way she did. This is about me, and if/how much of an asshole I am.

So, the situation. This morning my (45m) gf (43f) sent me a somewhat distressed text message (I’m away on business). Apparently, somehow, my contacts list had been mirrored to her phone (I guess I logged into google on it or something?). Now, my contacts on my phone is a hoarding ground of every contact I’ve ever added to a google capable phone over the last ~20 years, as I never delete them once they are in there. No specific reason for this.

So, her phone received a large number of new contacts from my own list, which is annoying, whatever.

The problem is, some of those contacts are from early in my dating life, either past relationships or while trying my luck on dating apps. And, to make it more obvious, I have them stored in my phone as “<name> Tinder”, for example. And, to make it worse, one previous ex showed up as a favorite (I used to be on android, where that was a thing. On iPhone now where it isn’t, so I don’t see that, but when it landed on her android it showed as favorite).

Now, I have well over 700 contacts I have amassed over the last couple decades, of which I still talk to maybe a dozen. it’s a hoarders dumping ground. Things don’t work out dating, or I just lose contact with someone, I just forget about it and move on. The contact remains.

I never really gave it a second thought, and certainly never expected it to be thrust into the face of my partner, but here we are. Obviously she is distressed and wondering why I kept those numbers, especially from a “hookup app” (I never used it for that), and I feel terrible that she has to see that and feel so much worry. I will, of course, be going through now and clearing it all out.

But, tell me guys, am I an asshole for being too lazy to delete old contacts? She feels it isn’t respectful to our relationship to have kept them, but honestly I didn’t ever even think about it, and I absolutely am not in contact with any previous romantic partners.

Tl;rd: I am a contact hoarder and never deleted my numbers from my phone, including people I previously dated. Contacts got accidentally sent to partners phone. She is sad I still have those contacts. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-24,"AITA for keeping my exe’s phone number Hi all. Throwaway for privacy.
