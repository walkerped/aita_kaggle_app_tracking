0,1d0e1x0,"AITA for arguing with my brother after he ""stole"" my favourite name?","I (27F) am the oldest sister of four children. I have three younger siblings, aged 24, 23, and 21. My youngest sibling recently came out as a trans man and everyone in our family is being super supportive, which is great. I have loved being able to support my brother through the earliest stages of his transition process.

The problem is with the name he has chosen for himself. I am someone who is very focused on my career but I have always known that I do want children eventually, and there is one name in particular I've had picked out for my future son since I was 14. I don't want to say the actual name because it's not too common, but let's pretend it's ""Evan"".

It's common knowledge in my family that I have always loved the name Evan. I have made it clear over the years that I intend to name my son that.

A few weeks ago, my brother sat the family down and told us that he is ready to change his name to a name that really fits him. He then told us that he is changing his name to Evan. I thought he was joking at first but once everyone started hugging him, I realised that he was serious. Without really thinking, I said, ""But that's my name."" He just shrugged it off and was like, ""Well, it's my name now.""

I tried not to get too upset about it because it felt very petty and I wanted to be supportive. But then everyone in my family started calling him Evan and I could feel myself being less and less okay with it. I tried to confide in my mum but she told me that I was being ridiculous, trying to claim ownership over a name.

Eventually, my brother asked why I wasn't calling him by his name and I asked him why he had to choose the one name that I've always wanted for my son. He told me that I was being unfair, trying to gatekeep a name for a baby that might never arrive. He said that I was ""further away from having a baby than ever"", which was hurtful because I recently broke up with my long-term boyfriend and moved back in with our parents. But from his perspective, ""Evan"" feels like a good fit and he is already here (unlike my future son), so he should take priority.

I do see where he is coming from and I do want to support him, but it hurt me that he and my mum were so willing to dismiss my feelings over it. It might not be a big thing to them but I've had this name picked for ages, to the point where my family have jokingly referred to my future son by name sometimes. I told my brother that he was being selfish and an AH.

1,1d0dq4z,"AITA for saying that dog-sitting for my best friend for two weeks (short notice) was a huge favor? Especially since I am currently having mental and physical health problems (IMO it was a huge favor, in their opinion, they were giving me “a sort of vacation”)","Hi y’all! Both me and my best friend are 23 y/o nonbinary and live at home with our families.

Recently, my absolute best friend in the world (of about a year and a half) asked me what I consider to be a huge favor.

The message I ended up sending in response included:
“When you did message me after a week of silence”
“You said a nice compliment and asked for a huge favor, and nothing else.”
“I have been having an extremely hard time lately due to”
“Was very disheartened that the first thing you’d want to say to me during this incredibly difficult time was to ask me to do something for you.”

They responded and implied I was TA:
“The ‘favor’ I asked was one I thought of bc I Know you’re having a hard time at your house and after discussing it with my parents, I thought it could be a sort of vacation for you to come here, play PS5, have food and drink, a pool, and some time away from family. We would even have paid you.”

Things about the request from my perspective:

-I’d stay over at their house and take care of their dog full-time for 2 weeks with only a week’s notice.

-IMO dog-sitting is a huge deal because you have to walk, feed/water, handle behavior, and live with a dog. I have never personally owned a dog and I have not dog-sat for anyone besides family (only once for my Dad). IMO dog-sitting for my best friend is a lot of responsibility and a lot to ask of someone with very little experience.

-I personally feel very uncomfortable and at times unsafe around dogs. I don’t like them and have made this clear to everyone I know. Even if my friend’s dog is small, her barking scares me, I don’t like that she jumps a lot, and I typically don’t feel comfortable being alone in a house with any dog, including my friend’s dog. 

-The only info I had was it would be watching their dog for two weeks. They didn’t tell me why it would benefit me like they said later on or anything else and didn’t allow me even a day to accept before finding someone else.

-All these “benefits” seem good but I already have access to almost all at my own home or I’m not interested. Respectfully, they seem like nice things to offer, but I believe even doing these things/being there aside from dog-sitting would actually end up being a huge amount of work for me in the end (cooking, cleaning up after myself, etc)

-“We even would pay you.” IMO for that amount of time, responsibility, and labor that should be a given. I consider myself a generous person, but if I am going to do something like this and for it to be free, I’d like to be the one offering to do it and/or offering for the service to be free.

So guys, I have already ended our relationship (edit: due to a lot of other issues-not enough space to describe: onesided) but, hypothetically, if I wanted to work through THIS issue, would I be TA and need to apologize or take accountability? 

Perhaps their opinion is more valid than I can see right now. Maybe their request is reasonable and these are good benefits.

2,1d0coo7,WIBTA for trying to bring my dog to my moms house?,"*EDIT*

My wife (F20) and I (M20) share our two pets that we brought into the relationship, her cat and my dog. We love both these animals the same but I somehow feel I have a little bit more say in what my dog does because I’ve had him since I was 10.

 Before we had an apt we lived with my mom, she’s not the greatest person (trans/homophobic, mental abuse, alcoholic, you know the whole 9 yards) and it was ruining my relationship with my wife so we moved to a different state when we turned 19 and saved up enough money. Now since I’ve moved I’ve gone from no contact to little contact as tensions aren’t so high anymore. I have to go back to my hometown for a special doctors appointment and she offered to host us, we are trying to come up with an excuse to stay at a hotel and visit for a few hours and keep an eye on my dog the whole time. She really misses my dog since he lived with us. I really want to let her see him but she made it very difficult to move and I had to sneak in and steal the dog back. My wife says she doesn’t want to bring him because she doesn’t want her to take the dog again, and he would be in the house or hotel while we went out. I understood this and it makes perfect sense but as much as I don’t like my mom, I understand how hard it is to not see a pet that lived with you for 10 years. I wish I could let it go but I can’t. We don’t have a car and I am not telling my mom my address for her to visit. WIBTA for bringing my dog against my wife’s objection?

3,1d02k49,AITA for implying to my dad’s neighbour that he’s senile to avoid being randomly outed?,"I (26M) am a transgender man. I’ve been out since I was 16 and started medically transitioning at 19. I’m pretty burly and I have a beard, so at this point no one would have any reason to think I’m trans unless I tell them. My dad (67M)’s perspective on this is basically “I won’t argue with you about it, but I’m also not going to change the way I refer to you.” If I directly call him out on it he just awkwardly waffles and dismisses it. It’s annoying, but I can live with it, especially because the rest of my family is largely supportive and trying to maintain a relationship with them while not interacting with my dad would be difficult and frustrating for everyone involved. 

I was visiting a couple of days ago, and my dad and I bumped into his neighbour from a few doors down and ended up in a conversation about a tree that had fallen down in the street. My dad introduced me to his neighbour with “this is my daughter, (old name).” Not really wanting to have to explain to this random stranger that I’m trans, I just said, “no Dad, I’m (name), your son, remember?” in a concerned/pitying tone of voice, then sort of looked at the neighbour with a sad expression. My dad, as usual, just awkwardly dismissed it and tried to continue the conversation without acknowledging it. The neighbour sort of did an “ah, gotcha” expression, and for the rest of the conversation he spoke slower to my dad.

Later, my dad told me he didn’t like that I’d made his neighbour think he was senile, because he might have conversations with him in the future and would have to spend those conversations being treated like he’s in the early stages of dementia. For my part, I think he invites it by referring to a guy no one would suspect is trans as a woman (not that I think he should refer to *any* trans person as their birth sex) and it was only a matter of time before someone thought he was nuts. I also feel that I had the right to keep it private that I’m trans to this stranger. My dad can feel free to explain the situation to him later, but in the moment I didn’t want to potentially have to get stuck in a conversation defending my identity as a trans person to him.

4,1d020dw,WIBTA for telling my niece’s dad what’s been going on with her?,"For some context, I’m a mid 20s female and I own my house. My sister (mid 30s, we’ll call her Mel) fell on hard times and I’ve let her and her 3 kids (16M, 14F, and 6F) move in with me. I love them all very dearly and for the most part we get along really great. We coordinate all of our child care together and she pays me to stay with me. Her children’s dad lives across the country but is very present in their lives.

However, lately we’ve been running into issues getting progressively worse with my niece (14F) who we’ll call Alex. What started as your typical teenage attitude has progressed beyond what is appropriate especially for her age. It used to be just lying, breaking things and not saying anything, stealing and hiding things, blaming her younger sister for things, and putting us down repeatedly but within the last day we’ve discovered that she’s been sneaking her boyfriend into my house when I’m not there. I work night shifts and Mel sleeps in the attic, so Alex has him climb the side of our house and in through her window. I feel so disrespected and hurt by her actions lately but this really is the icing on the cake. I wasn’t a good teenager by any means but this? I feel as though my hospitality has been taken advantage of by her and now I have lost any and all trust. It hurts because we used to be more close than anyone. I don’t exactly know why but just the fact that there has been someone in my house when I’m not there, teenager or not, also has me feeling uneasy about not being there now. 

The problem, besides the obvious one, is that Mel doesn’t feel it’s necessary to discuss Alex’s behaviors and the things she’s been doing with her father. I think she fears it’s going to make her look like a bad mom but I personally believe not only does he have a right to know about this very serious situation but she could stand to benefit from his backup with this.

7,1d01i43,AITA for telling my roommate to rehome “their” dog or find a new place to live?,"AITA - Roommates and bad dogs

My roommate took on a dog for what was supposed to be 2-6 weeks or so, but it has now been 6 months with this full grown dog that pees and poops in our house (often getting onto children’s toys, bedding, and books), gets into and destroys garbage, and both dogs they have get onto the counter or table to eat ANYTHING, thawing meat, cooked food, snacks, things off plates or pans, and food quite literally straight out of my kids’ hands. My roommates reaction to being upset and wanting something done is to now state the dog is theirs when previously ownership always belonged to their ex/babydaddy, and  is refusing to find a new living solution for him. They Claim crates are inhumane and get mad when you lock them in their room because they’ll destroy the bedroom. The roommate also claims this behavior is normal and any dog would do these things, they feel as though the messes are inevitable- and maybe even sometimes they are, SOMETIMES, but multiple times every week? 

Here is why idk if I’m the AH-   Is letting them know they need to find a new place for the dog like they were originally supposed to, or for them all, an appropriate reaction or uncalled for?  Obviously a lot has been going on, there are a lot more things they’ve been doing as well. My other roommate is on my side about this all, they have felt the same about the issues the whole time. 

Extra information-   Only 400$ was paid between them and their partner to move in, plus a pet deposit because they had one dog when we moved in to begin with and we added a cat as a group. They still owe our landlord another 100$ in deposit which was required if the guest dog was going to be here more than 2 weeks and they are late on rent nearly every month without communication.

My roommate took on a dog for what was supposed to be 2-6 weeks or so, but it has now been 6 months with this full grown dog that pees and poops in our house (often getting onto children’s toys, bedding, and books), gets into and destroys garbage, and both dogs they have get onto the counter or table to eat ANYTHING, thawing meat, cooked food, snacks, things off plates or pans, and food quite literally straight out of my kids’ hands. My roommates reaction to being upset and wanting something done is to now state the dog is theirs when previously ownership always belonged to their ex/babydaddy, and  is refusing to find a new living solution for him. They Claim crates are inhumane and get mad when you lock them in their room because they’ll destroy the bedroom. The roommate also claims this behavior is normal and any dog would do these things, they feel as though the messes are inevitable- and maybe even sometimes they are, SOMETIMES, but multiple times every week? 

Here is why idk if I’m the AH-   Is letting them know they need to find a new place for the dog like they were originally supposed to, or for them all, an appropriate reaction or uncalled for?  Obviously a lot has been going on, there are a lot more things they’ve been doing as well. My other roommate is on my side about this all, they have felt the same about the issues the whole time. 

Extra information-   Only 400$ was paid between them and their partner to move in, plus a pet deposit because they had one dog when we moved in to begin with and we added a cat as a group. They still owe our landlord another 100$ in deposit which was required if the guest dog was going to be here more than 2 weeks and they are late on rent nearly every month without communication. Our landlord isn’t sure he can do much about it but he’s trying and in contact with his lawyers.

8,1d00xwz,AITA for finding my daughters vape and using it? ,"I (41 F) am a single mom to 3 daughters. (16,13,11) We are a close knit, loving family, and all of my daughters know that it is never okay to vape,smoke,drink,etc until they are older. 

This has never been an issue until about a month ago. I started noticing my oldest  was acting strange but didn’t think much of it. For example, it started out as her leaving her window open at night and me always yelling at her to close it. I didn’t think it was concerning, it more annoyed me because we usually kept our AC on. But starting about a month ago, I started hearing her cough loudly. Not a normal cough, a very scratchy one. I started getting very suspicious and knew something was going on. 

Sure enough, I found a vape while tidying up her room about 3 weeks ago. I decided not to talk to her about it. I was truly dissapointed in her because we have always set boundaries and expectations that vaping is never okay, and she knows that. I am usually one to stay true to my word, but I do vape occasionally. 

Ever since I took her vape, I have found myself hitting it at night when my kids are asleep. It’s very relieving and I can’t always trust myself to not touch it. I made sure to be slick about it, not letting my daughters know that I do hit it. 

But the other night, my daughter came downstairs to catch me in the middle of taking a hit of her vape. She immediately yelled at me saying how it’s not okay to take her things, and how I’m a hypocrite for not staying true to my word. I apologized but told her how she shouldn’t have had the vape in the first place.

I do feel bad for taking it and not staying true to my word, because I struggle to hold myself accountable too, but on the other hand she knows it is not okay to vape and the consequences of her actions are that the vape gets taken. I don’t know what to tell her after that night. AITA?

The next day I told my bf I would be hanging out with my friend for the day since he would be gone the next day and I offered ways to help him be more comfortable with us hanging out, he asked me to message him every 15 minutes while I was at his place, felt a bit over board to me but I understood and did that, the next visit was a few weeks ago and I wanted to hang out with my friend since I had stopped regularly calling him after December in fear my bf would be upset saying I was calling him too much (originally we call once a week to catch up on what’s been going on in life and how his collage is going, now it’s twice a month at most now)

He had changed his mind and didn’t want me hanging out with him by myself and that he didn’t trust me anymore, I tried to explain again that nothing was going on and he was free to call or message me while I was at my friends house whenever he wanted, but he did not want me going at all, by this point we had gone back and forth on this for two hours I had gotten sick of the arguing,I told him in the nicest way I could that he is my friend and realistically I can go hang out with him and whoever I want when I want and that I only asked if I could hang out with my friend to let him feel more comfortable with everything also that he can know what’s going on. 

I can understand his frustration so that is why I’m wondering if I’m the one in the wrong",Asshole,2024-05-25,"AITA for continuing a normal friendship with my best friend I (19M) and my boyfriend (18M) have been in many arguments over me visiting with my friend who moved away, who I had a past friends with benefits situation with before my relationship with now bf. me and my friend had made strict boundaries of no intimate actions other then smashing, we only agreed to do it because we were both not in any relationships at the time and he was moving in two months. we only did it three times and had agreed that it would not affect our friendship and we would not be continuing after he moved.

I notified my family 3 years ago that we changed internet provider. I asked them to change their emails to Gmail because their email connected to the old internet provider would be cancelled. Well after 3 years of continuous reminders and reassurance that they have switched I finally cancelled.

I waited this long because of my kids always saying they didn’t have time to change their emails. Now they are angry with me because they didn’t fully change their email contact info.

20,1czzd3g,AITA for not staying the night at my boyfriend’s temporary place after I surprised him saying I would stay the night ,"My (21F) boyfriend (22M) is an international student who has staying been staying in his apartment with his brother for about 5 years. The apartment management randomly decided to renovate their floor and put them out without notice or accommodation. They had 2 months to try to find a place. The rental market was and is still incredibly difficult in our city especially for students on a visa so long story short he wasn’t able to find a place and has been couch hopping for the last 6 months or so. 

I still live at home and am not able to offer him a place to stay but I’ve been helping him look for listings and driving him to the showings. I’ve personally experienced the racism and apprehension at the showings. It’s been really hard on him and I know this. 

His friend’s mom is out of the country for 2 months so she offered him the place to stay while no one is there. I planned to come down and see him for the day a few days after he moved in, we were going to get food and walk around the city as the apartment is actually in a nice and busy area. I decided to pack an overnight bag and surprise him and tell him I would stay the night!  

It was an hour train ride, I met up with him and we went up to the apartment first to drop my bag. He warned me that it was incredibly hot inside and the building had no a/c. But I wasn’t expecting what I walked into. The minute I walk in the first thing that hits me is the smell, I literally said “it smells like an old people home in here” and he said …”it is”. I was like oh.. It just smelt like musty cat piss plus it was SO HOT and HUMID. We get up to the floor he’s staying on and the heat keeps intensifying the more we walk down the corridor. It was about 29 degrees Celsius outside (we were also having a heat wave) but inside the building it felt like 39. In the apartment there was only one room with one bed in it, one two seater couch and a reclining chair. He was staying there with a friend and his brother… Where was I meant to sleep? I don’t know… We drop my bag and head out and had such a beautiful day, we got ramen and icecream. It was a great day, we get back around 9pm and I tell him I’m going to grab my bag and head back to the train station because I wasn’t comfortable staying there. He visibly got really upset and went quiet. I asked him what was wrong and he said “I don’t understand why you can’t just stay with me. It feels like you don’t consider me as much as I consider you because if I had to be uncomfortable for one night, I would do it for you”. I tried to explain that it just didn’t even really seem to make sense because there wasn’t really that much room and honestly I wasn’t comfortable staying there, I didn’t even know this friend would be there too. I could see that he was really hurt, I stayed and comforted him for about another hour and I felt really bad but I still did go home though. AITA?
