0,1d0e1x0,"AITA for arguing with my brother after he ""stole"" my favourite name?","I (27F) am the oldest sister of four children. I have three younger siblings, aged 24, 23, and 21. My youngest sibling recently came out as a trans man and everyone in our family is being super supportive, which is great. I have loved being able to support my brother through the earliest stages of his transition process.

The problem is with the name he has chosen for himself. I am someone who is very focused on my career but I have always known that I do want children eventually, and there is one name in particular I've had picked out for my future son since I was 14. I don't want to say the actual name because it's not too common, but let's pretend it's ""Evan"".

It's common knowledge in my family that I have always loved the name Evan. I have made it clear over the years that I intend to name my son that.

A few weeks ago, my brother sat the family down and told us that he is ready to change his name to a name that really fits him. He then told us that he is changing his name to Evan. I thought he was joking at first but once everyone started hugging him, I realised that he was serious. Without really thinking, I said, ""But that's my name."" He just shrugged it off and was like, ""Well, it's my name now.""

I tried not to get too upset about it because it felt very petty and I wanted to be supportive. But then everyone in my family started calling him Evan and I could feel myself being less and less okay with it. I tried to confide in my mum but she told me that I was being ridiculous, trying to claim ownership over a name.

Eventually, my brother asked why I wasn't calling him by his name and I asked him why he had to choose the one name that I've always wanted for my son. He told me that I was being unfair, trying to gatekeep a name for a baby that might never arrive. He said that I was ""further away from having a baby than ever"", which was hurtful because I recently broke up with my long-term boyfriend and moved back in with our parents. But from his perspective, ""Evan"" feels like a good fit and he is already here (unlike my future son), so he should take priority.

I do see where he is coming from and I do want to support him, but it hurt me that he and my mum were so willing to dismiss my feelings over it. It might not be a big thing to them but I've had this name picked for ages, to the point where my family have jokingly referred to my future son by name sometimes. I told my brother that he was being selfish and an AH.

1,1d0dq4z,"AITA for saying that dog-sitting for my best friend for two weeks (short notice) was a huge favor? Especially since I am currently having mental and physical health problems (IMO it was a huge favor, in their opinion, they were giving me “a sort of vacation”)","Hi y’all! Both me and my best friend are 23 y/o nonbinary and live at home with our families.

Recently, my absolute best friend in the world (of about a year and a half) asked me what I consider to be a huge favor.

The message I ended up sending in response included:
“When you did message me after a week of silence”
“You said a nice compliment and asked for a huge favor, and nothing else.”
“I have been having an extremely hard time lately due to”
“Was very disheartened that the first thing you’d want to say to me during this incredibly difficult time was to ask me to do something for you.”

They responded and implied I was TA:
“The ‘favor’ I asked was one I thought of bc I Know you’re having a hard time at your house and after discussing it with my parents, I thought it could be a sort of vacation for you to come here, play PS5, have food and drink, a pool, and some time away from family. We would even have paid you.”

Things about the request from my perspective:

-I’d stay over at their house and take care of their dog full-time for 2 weeks with only a week’s notice.

-IMO dog-sitting is a huge deal because you have to walk, feed/water, handle behavior, and live with a dog. I have never personally owned a dog and I have not dog-sat for anyone besides family (only once for my Dad). IMO dog-sitting for my best friend is a lot of responsibility and a lot to ask of someone with very little experience.

-I personally feel very uncomfortable and at times unsafe around dogs. I don’t like them and have made this clear to everyone I know. Even if my friend’s dog is small, her barking scares me, I don’t like that she jumps a lot, and I typically don’t feel comfortable being alone in a house with any dog, including my friend’s dog. 

-The only info I had was it would be watching their dog for two weeks. They didn’t tell me why it would benefit me like they said later on or anything else and didn’t allow me even a day to accept before finding someone else.

-All these “benefits” seem good but I already have access to almost all at my own home or I’m not interested. Respectfully, they seem like nice things to offer, but I believe even doing these things/being there aside from dog-sitting would actually end up being a huge amount of work for me in the end (cooking, cleaning up after myself, etc)

-“We even would pay you.” IMO for that amount of time, responsibility, and labor that should be a given. I consider myself a generous person, but if I am going to do something like this and for it to be free, I’d like to be the one offering to do it and/or offering for the service to be free.

So guys, I have already ended our relationship (edit: due to a lot of other issues-not enough space to describe: onesided) but, hypothetically, if I wanted to work through THIS issue, would I be TA and need to apologize or take accountability? 

Perhaps their opinion is more valid than I can see right now. Maybe their request is reasonable and these are good benefits.

2,1d0coo7,WIBTA for trying to bring my dog to my moms house?,"*EDIT*

My wife (F20) and I (M20) share our two pets that we brought into the relationship, her cat and my dog. We love both these animals the same but I somehow feel I have a little bit more say in what my dog does because I’ve had him since I was 10.

 Before we had an apt we lived with my mom, she’s not the greatest person (trans/homophobic, mental abuse, alcoholic, you know the whole 9 yards) and it was ruining my relationship with my wife so we moved to a different state when we turned 19 and saved up enough money. Now since I’ve moved I’ve gone from no contact to little contact as tensions aren’t so high anymore. I have to go back to my hometown for a special doctors appointment and she offered to host us, we are trying to come up with an excuse to stay at a hotel and visit for a few hours and keep an eye on my dog the whole time. She really misses my dog since he lived with us. I really want to let her see him but she made it very difficult to move and I had to sneak in and steal the dog back. My wife says she doesn’t want to bring him because she doesn’t want her to take the dog again, and he would be in the house or hotel while we went out. I understood this and it makes perfect sense but as much as I don’t like my mom, I understand how hard it is to not see a pet that lived with you for 10 years. I wish I could let it go but I can’t. We don’t have a car and I am not telling my mom my address for her to visit. WIBTA for bringing my dog against my wife’s objection?

3,1d02k49,AITA for implying to my dad’s neighbour that he’s senile to avoid being randomly outed?,"I (26M) am a transgender man. I’ve been out since I was 16 and started medically transitioning at 19. I’m pretty burly and I have a beard, so at this point no one would have any reason to think I’m trans unless I tell them. My dad (67M)’s perspective on this is basically “I won’t argue with you about it, but I’m also not going to change the way I refer to you.” If I directly call him out on it he just awkwardly waffles and dismisses it. It’s annoying, but I can live with it, especially because the rest of my family is largely supportive and trying to maintain a relationship with them while not interacting with my dad would be difficult and frustrating for everyone involved. 

I was visiting a couple of days ago, and my dad and I bumped into his neighbour from a few doors down and ended up in a conversation about a tree that had fallen down in the street. My dad introduced me to his neighbour with “this is my daughter, (old name).” Not really wanting to have to explain to this random stranger that I’m trans, I just said, “no Dad, I’m (name), your son, remember?” in a concerned/pitying tone of voice, then sort of looked at the neighbour with a sad expression. My dad, as usual, just awkwardly dismissed it and tried to continue the conversation without acknowledging it. The neighbour sort of did an “ah, gotcha” expression, and for the rest of the conversation he spoke slower to my dad.

Later, my dad told me he didn’t like that I’d made his neighbour think he was senile, because he might have conversations with him in the future and would have to spend those conversations being treated like he’s in the early stages of dementia. For my part, I think he invites it by referring to a guy no one would suspect is trans as a woman (not that I think he should refer to *any* trans person as their birth sex) and it was only a matter of time before someone thought he was nuts. I also feel that I had the right to keep it private that I’m trans to this stranger. My dad can feel free to explain the situation to him later, but in the moment I didn’t want to potentially have to get stuck in a conversation defending my identity as a trans person to him.

4,1d020dw,WIBTA for telling my niece’s dad what’s been going on with her?,"For some context, I’m a mid 20s female and I own my house. My sister (mid 30s, we’ll call her Mel) fell on hard times and I’ve let her and her 3 kids (16M, 14F, and 6F) move in with me. I love them all very dearly and for the most part we get along really great. We coordinate all of our child care together and she pays me to stay with me. Her children’s dad lives across the country but is very present in their lives.

However, lately we’ve been running into issues getting progressively worse with my niece (14F) who we’ll call Alex. What started as your typical teenage attitude has progressed beyond what is appropriate especially for her age. It used to be just lying, breaking things and not saying anything, stealing and hiding things, blaming her younger sister for things, and putting us down repeatedly but within the last day we’ve discovered that she’s been sneaking her boyfriend into my house when I’m not there. I work night shifts and Mel sleeps in the attic, so Alex has him climb the side of our house and in through her window. I feel so disrespected and hurt by her actions lately but this really is the icing on the cake. I wasn’t a good teenager by any means but this? I feel as though my hospitality has been taken advantage of by her and now I have lost any and all trust. It hurts because we used to be more close than anyone. I don’t exactly know why but just the fact that there has been someone in my house when I’m not there, teenager or not, also has me feeling uneasy about not being there now. 

The problem, besides the obvious one, is that Mel doesn’t feel it’s necessary to discuss Alex’s behaviors and the things she’s been doing with her father. I think she fears it’s going to make her look like a bad mom but I personally believe not only does he have a right to know about this very serious situation but she could stand to benefit from his backup with this.

7,1d01i43,AITA for telling my roommate to rehome “their” dog or find a new place to live?,"AITA - Roommates and bad dogs

My roommate took on a dog for what was supposed to be 2-6 weeks or so, but it has now been 6 months with this full grown dog that pees and poops in our house (often getting onto children’s toys, bedding, and books), gets into and destroys garbage, and both dogs they have get onto the counter or table to eat ANYTHING, thawing meat, cooked food, snacks, things off plates or pans, and food quite literally straight out of my kids’ hands. My roommates reaction to being upset and wanting something done is to now state the dog is theirs when previously ownership always belonged to their ex/babydaddy, and  is refusing to find a new living solution for him. They Claim crates are inhumane and get mad when you lock them in their room because they’ll destroy the bedroom. The roommate also claims this behavior is normal and any dog would do these things, they feel as though the messes are inevitable- and maybe even sometimes they are, SOMETIMES, but multiple times every week? 

Here is why idk if I’m the AH-   Is letting them know they need to find a new place for the dog like they were originally supposed to, or for them all, an appropriate reaction or uncalled for?  Obviously a lot has been going on, there are a lot more things they’ve been doing as well. My other roommate is on my side about this all, they have felt the same about the issues the whole time. 

Extra information-   Only 400$ was paid between them and their partner to move in, plus a pet deposit because they had one dog when we moved in to begin with and we added a cat as a group. They still owe our landlord another 100$ in deposit which was required if the guest dog was going to be here more than 2 weeks and they are late on rent nearly every month without communication.

My roommate took on a dog for what was supposed to be 2-6 weeks or so, but it has now been 6 months with this full grown dog that pees and poops in our house (often getting onto children’s toys, bedding, and books), gets into and destroys garbage, and both dogs they have get onto the counter or table to eat ANYTHING, thawing meat, cooked food, snacks, things off plates or pans, and food quite literally straight out of my kids’ hands. My roommates reaction to being upset and wanting something done is to now state the dog is theirs when previously ownership always belonged to their ex/babydaddy, and  is refusing to find a new living solution for him. They Claim crates are inhumane and get mad when you lock them in their room because they’ll destroy the bedroom. The roommate also claims this behavior is normal and any dog would do these things, they feel as though the messes are inevitable- and maybe even sometimes they are, SOMETIMES, but multiple times every week? 

Here is why idk if I’m the AH-   Is letting them know they need to find a new place for the dog like they were originally supposed to, or for them all, an appropriate reaction or uncalled for?  Obviously a lot has been going on, there are a lot more things they’ve been doing as well. My other roommate is on my side about this all, they have felt the same about the issues the whole time. 

Extra information-   Only 400$ was paid between them and their partner to move in, plus a pet deposit because they had one dog when we moved in to begin with and we added a cat as a group. They still owe our landlord another 100$ in deposit which was required if the guest dog was going to be here more than 2 weeks and they are late on rent nearly every month without communication. Our landlord isn’t sure he can do much about it but he’s trying and in contact with his lawyers.

8,1d00xwz,AITA for finding my daughters vape and using it? ,"I (41 F) am a single mom to 3 daughters. (16,13,11) We are a close knit, loving family, and all of my daughters know that it is never okay to vape,smoke,drink,etc until they are older. 

This has never been an issue until about a month ago. I started noticing my oldest  was acting strange but didn’t think much of it. For example, it started out as her leaving her window open at night and me always yelling at her to close it. I didn’t think it was concerning, it more annoyed me because we usually kept our AC on. But starting about a month ago, I started hearing her cough loudly. Not a normal cough, a very scratchy one. I started getting very suspicious and knew something was going on. 

Sure enough, I found a vape while tidying up her room about 3 weeks ago. I decided not to talk to her about it. I was truly dissapointed in her because we have always set boundaries and expectations that vaping is never okay, and she knows that. I am usually one to stay true to my word, but I do vape occasionally. 

Ever since I took her vape, I have found myself hitting it at night when my kids are asleep. It’s very relieving and I can’t always trust myself to not touch it. I made sure to be slick about it, not letting my daughters know that I do hit it. 

But the other night, my daughter came downstairs to catch me in the middle of taking a hit of her vape. She immediately yelled at me saying how it’s not okay to take her things, and how I’m a hypocrite for not staying true to my word. I apologized but told her how she shouldn’t have had the vape in the first place.

I do feel bad for taking it and not staying true to my word, because I struggle to hold myself accountable too, but on the other hand she knows it is not okay to vape and the consequences of her actions are that the vape gets taken. I don’t know what to tell her after that night. AITA?

20,1czzd3g,AITA for not staying the night at my boyfriend’s temporary place after I surprised him saying I would stay the night ,"My (21F) boyfriend (22M) is an international student who has staying been staying in his apartment with his brother for about 5 years. The apartment management randomly decided to renovate their floor and put them out without notice or accommodation. They had 2 months to try to find a place. The rental market was and is still incredibly difficult in our city especially for students on a visa so long story short he wasn’t able to find a place and has been couch hopping for the last 6 months or so. 

I still live at home and am not able to offer him a place to stay but I’ve been helping him look for listings and driving him to the showings. I’ve personally experienced the racism and apprehension at the showings. It’s been really hard on him and I know this. 

His friend’s mom is out of the country for 2 months so she offered him the place to stay while no one is there. I planned to come down and see him for the day a few days after he moved in, we were going to get food and walk around the city as the apartment is actually in a nice and busy area. I decided to pack an overnight bag and surprise him and tell him I would stay the night!  

It was an hour train ride, I met up with him and we went up to the apartment first to drop my bag. He warned me that it was incredibly hot inside and the building had no a/c. But I wasn’t expecting what I walked into. The minute I walk in the first thing that hits me is the smell, I literally said “it smells like an old people home in here” and he said …”it is”. I was like oh.. It just smelt like musty cat piss plus it was SO HOT and HUMID. We get up to the floor he’s staying on and the heat keeps intensifying the more we walk down the corridor. It was about 29 degrees Celsius outside (we were also having a heat wave) but inside the building it felt like 39. In the apartment there was only one room with one bed in it, one two seater couch and a reclining chair. He was staying there with a friend and his brother… Where was I meant to sleep? I don’t know… We drop my bag and head out and had such a beautiful day, we got ramen and icecream. It was a great day, we get back around 9pm and I tell him I’m going to grab my bag and head back to the train station because I wasn’t comfortable staying there. He visibly got really upset and went quiet. I asked him what was wrong and he said “I don’t understand why you can’t just stay with me. It feels like you don’t consider me as much as I consider you because if I had to be uncomfortable for one night, I would do it for you”. I tried to explain that it just didn’t even really seem to make sense because there wasn’t really that much room and honestly I wasn’t comfortable staying there, I didn’t even know this friend would be there too.

21,1d0oyr4,AITA for telling my mum no when she is pushing me to arrange my wedding?,"I F42 have just been through two rounds of IVF with my partner M45. We’ve been together for just over 5 years, and though we wanted to buy a house, get married and have children, COVID, and life kind messed that up. We agreed to try IVF twice. Luckily, and against all odds, I am now not quite 12 weeks pregnant. My mother loves me and has been quite supportive although she really hasn’t understood the toll that IVF took on me physically or mentally.

This started with a little argument just as I was starting the second round of simulation injections. I had explained to her many times that the doctors tell you to avoid any stress during this time to try to improve egg quality. I have not been able to get married because many years ago, my parents bought a flat and put my name on the deed. A new law in 2019 meant that if I buy any property they class this as a 2nd property and charge me double stamp duty. I have never benefited at all from having my name on the deed of the flat, indeed it made many things more difficult. We had been trying to sell, but had a few sales fall through.

Just before 2nd cycle IVF, we managed to sell. Anyway, the argument was because I had asked her to not cause me any stress for a month whilst I was injecting, explaining this was the last time I would put my body through this, and I wanted to give it my best shot. She then said, “Why don’t you arrange your wedding now?” I admit that I hit the roof a bit. I mean, most people recognise that arranging that kind of life event can be stressful, and I’ve just told her that I need zero stress during IVF. Why was she pushing this now? She said she thought it would be fun. I told her it wouldn’t be. My partner found me in tears as she wouldn’t listen.

Fast forward to 9 weeks pregnant; I have been very sick for weeks. Anyway, my mother messages me to say that I should get married this summer. I can organise it in a couple of months. I tell her that it is stressful and that I want to enjoy my wedding rather than feel sick and awful. Also, it wasn’t until I’d already started the 2nd round of IVF that I could even get married due to the flat being sold. She got sullen and said, “oh well, I guess we’re not the same, even though we have the same face. I think of it as double happiness” Er, no!

My hair is greasy, my skin is more oily, I don’t feel great most days, plus it will be extra stress on my body and mind whilst I’m trying to grow a healthy baby. I was upset and angry that she keeps pushing this. My partner is supportive and thinks she doesn’t want a grandchild out of wedlock. Ideally I would have wanted my life to be in a different order, but what can you do? We also think maybe she’s feeling her own mortality, but I don’t think it’s wise or right to add stress to my plate during such a delicate time. I don’t feel super relaxed about the pregnancy, so I’m just doing my best to try to remain cautiously optimistic.

24,1d0o4yy,WIBTA for cancelling a month long trip with my best friend/co-worker?,"For the last 4 years, I (30M) have been working at a certain company where I met a co-worker (27M), who became one of my best friends. After finding out that he shared the same hobby as mine, we connected, bonded and regularly engage in activities pertaining to our common hobby.

Apart from my usual hobby, every year I also go for solo traveling to overseas, mainly in Japan and other countries from East-Asia. Due to being introvert, I do not like traveling with others as I love the freedom of able to set my own schedule and go wherever I want.

For this year's trip, I have decided to go to Japan for about a month in December. Whilst I was chatting with my co-worker about our upcoming annual leaves, I told him about my plans to travel to Japan to which, he stated that he was also interested in Japan and would like to tag along with me. Due to our matching hobbies and having similar taste in sub-cultures, I believed that traveling with my co-worker would be an exciting thing for me to try and break away from solo traveling. In the end, we made a decision to book in for a month worth of annual leaves in December, which were approved by our HR department.

When my co-worker and I were discussing about acquiring plane tickets, accommodations etc, we delved into where we want to go and do activities. Here, I realised that my co-worker had a completely different outlook on what to do in Japan. They were completely opposite of where I wanted to go. I now realised that if I do go with my co-worker for a whole month with his schedules in mind, I will not enjoy staying in Japan at all and will be stressed out to force myself to go with his itineraries. Ultimately, I realised that I made a mistake of planning a trip with my co-worker in the first place where, I should have just stuck with solo traveling.

All in all, I am planning to speak to him and tell him that I want to cancel our trip to Japan in December. I will probably use a fake excuse (e.g. family commitments) as I believe that if I tell him the truth for cancelling the plan, our friendship will most likely break, which I do not wish.

Having said that, I probably deserved it for cancelling the trip without a valid reason.

Just to clarify, my co-worker had not paid for his plane ticket, accomodation or anything related to the trip. The only commitment he had made was booking in a month worth of annual leave in December. He did mention that should we cancel the trip, he will probably organise a trip to his home country and visit his family. Though, he is extremely keen on travelling with me to Japan in December.

26,1d0nrnq,AITA for refusing to spend the holidays and My Mother-in-Law’s Birthday with My Boyfriend’s Family?,"I (24) and my boyfriend (26) have been together for four years.

My bf mom is really difficult. She insists that everything be done her way and doesn’t accept other people’s opinions or plans.  Even if you say no multiple times, she will do her own.

The point of the story is that his parents are celebrating their birthdays at the end of the year, and my boyfriend planned a trip to another country. I told him from the beginning that I didn’t want to participate because I want to spend the Christmas with my family. However, I offered to compromise by joining them for three days for his mom’s birthday. He wasn’t happy but reluctantly agreed, although he expressed concerns about explaining it to his mom.
After more discussions, we decided I wouldn’t participate, so I made preliminary plans with my friends for New Year’s Eve, knowing I would be alone. Now, they’ve changed their plans, deciding to stay in our hometown for Christmas, so my boyfriend believes there’s no reason I can’t join him and his parents.
I told my boyfriend about my plans with my friends, which made him even more upset. I tried to compromise again, suggesting we organize the trip right after Christmas, celebrate his mom’s birthday with his family, and then I would leave to join my friends for New Year’s Eve. This didn’t make him happy either. He said that while it’s fine if I care about it so much, his parents won’t like it and will make comments, possibly ruining the trip and forcing him to make new plans again because of me.
I can see that my boyfriend is really hurt by my stance, but I feel like if I don’t stand up for myself and what I want, our whole life will be overshadowed by his mom, dictating what we do. I fear he will always say, “You know how she is, nobody can do anything about that.” I feel frustrated because I clearly expressed my feelings about the trip and my relationship with his mom from the start. I told him I don’t appreciate her behavior anymore and want him to stand up more. We are both very sensitive and easily manipulated, but I’m working on this in therapy. However, it doesn’t seem to help when it comes to his mom.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-25,"AITA for refusing to spend the holidays and My Mother-in-Law’s Birthday with My Boyfriend’s Family? I (24) and my boyfriend (26) have been together for four years.

My bf mom is really difficult. She insists that everything be done her way and doesn’t accept other people’s opinions or plans.  Even if you say no multiple times, she will do her own.

The point of the story is that his parents are celebrating their birthdays at the end of the year, and my boyfriend planned a trip to another country. I told him from the beginning that I didn’t want to participate because I want to spend the Christmas with my family. However, I offered to compromise by joining them for three days for his mom’s birthday. He wasn’t happy but reluctantly agreed, although he expressed concerns about explaining it to his mom.
After more discussions, we decided I wouldn’t participate, so I made preliminary plans with my friends for New Year’s Eve, knowing I would be alone. Now, they’ve changed their plans, deciding to stay in our hometown for Christmas, so my boyfriend believes there’s no reason I can’t join him and his parents.
I told my boyfriend about my plans with my friends, which made him even more upset. I tried to compromise again, suggesting we organize the trip right after Christmas, celebrate his mom’s birthday with his family, and then I would leave to join my friends for New Year’s Eve. This didn’t make him happy either. He said that while it’s fine if I care about it so much, his parents won’t like it and will make comments, possibly ruining the trip and forcing him to make new plans again because of me.

27,1d0nn8i,AITA for not stopping to explain what I was doing to a bystander while I was helping a seizing man?,"Please do not share this outside Reddit. 

I’ll try to keep it short. I (40F) witnessed a dude have a seizure, which I was able to identify bc my best friend is epileptic and has been since we were kids. A few bystanders came over and helped me stabilize him as he was a big dude and I’m an average sized woman. Another woman and I were on the ground with him when suddenly a not-at-all-good-Samaritan we’ll call Dick shows up and starts barking (wrong) orders and instructions. Neither of us listen to him or act on his demands. He gets louder and louder and starts recording, saying it’s evidence that “these women refuse to let me help this man!”  

Eventually the seizing stops and EMS and the police show up. Dick immediately accosts the medics AND cops shouting about how he was trying to help and nobody would listen to or let him.  After everyone chatted, EMS confirms what we did for the seizing man was correct. 

Dick is outraged and then decides to direct his ire square at me and tells me that all I had to do was explain it to him in the first place. Internally I was like: What? You’re suggesting the “correct” answer was for me to take my attention off a medical emergency and explain to you why and how I was doing what I was doing/not doing? But I said, “I do not owe you or your ego any explanation for anything, ever, most certainly not in the middle of a medical emergency,  but for your information my best friend of 25+ years is epileptic. This is how I know what to do and not to do in the event of a seizure.” He YELLED, “That’s all you had to say!” At this point even the cops piped up and one said, verbatim, “No she didn’t, bro. She was focused on helping the guy.”  

I felt like I didn’t do anything wrong but was also kind of rattled, so when my friend’s wife later said I was being harsh and arrogant by not acknowledging and/or addressing Dick during the actual seizure and later referring to his ego in my “speech” to him I kind of felt like an asshole. 

She said he too was also just trying to help and “possibly prevent a disaster,” and then asked who anointed me the “Jesus of the situation.” I said I wasn’t being arrogant Jesus, I was simply the first one to get to the guy, knew he was having a seizure, and knew what to do, so I did it and didn’t concern myself with a dude screaming (again, WRONG!) orders in the background. 

Outside the screaming guy it was really a scene full of good people trying to help and made me feel better about humanity even. And then this friend’s wife basically called me an arrogant asshole.

Most weekends we would hangout, I've met his parents and siblings multiple times, and we have deep conversations every day about anything and everything.

I always celebrate his milestones and achievements, and I've given him gifts for christmas, his graduation, his birthday, etc. when he didn't even wish me happy birthday.

The dresser I currently have at my apartment is built terribly, I tried my best to build it but I am clearly terrible at it because the drawers don't even shut. Everyone makes fun of this when they see my room, him included. I just moved into a new apartment, so I was thinking about buying a new dresser. When looking, I noticed most all of them don't come assembled. Knowing how it went when I tried to build it, I thought I would ask him if he would build it for me by chance if I bought one. This was a hypothetical, I hadn't even bought one yet and knew I probably wouldn't if he said no, no issues there. But I was shocked when his response was ""Out of the kindness of my heart?"" I asked him what he meant, and he said ""I'm asking why I should do it?"" This shocked me, because I always help friends in need. In the past, I've noticed he is pretty selfish and lacks empathy towards people, so I genuinely was concerned at that response and said ""Friends help eachother, it's what friends do? I've helped you countless times for nothing in return, you even insulted me when I helped you a few times."" Sure, that might have been rude, but it's true and he never has apologized for things he said so I guess I still harbor a lot of sadness from that.

I live with my parents and 2 of my siblings (26 M & 29 F) full time, while my other 2 visit often. When my brother visits (usually once a month), my mom always gives him my room to stay in and forces me to clean it every time he comes. Last year, she even gave him my room for 2 months while he visited, and I had to stay with my sister’s in her room (it was awful). 
My mom knows that I hate giving up my room, but forces me to anyway bc he’s “my older brother” and he’s her son and wants him to be comfortable.

Where I live, June is my busiest school month, as it is the last school month. Meaning, I have multiple tests and assignments every single week of June. My mom just informed me that my brother will be coming over and is most likely going to be staying at our house for over 3 months while he looks for a job. Without even asking me, she’s giving him my room. I protested, telling her that I deserve the right to feel comfortable too, as it is MY room. I also mentioned that this last month of school will be so busy, and I want to be able to focus on studying for my exams in my own room. 

We also have a pretty good sized room in the basement of our house, which came up in the conversation, but because we rent our house and technically aren’t supposed have access to it, (we would have to pay money to rent it) my mom isn’t allowing me or my brother to have it while he’s here. 
We also have a whole other house that he could absolutely live in for 3 months, but my mom is refusing bc it is her house, and in her words, “doesn’t have air conditioning, and I want him to be comfortable”. I don’t understand why he can’t just get a fan?? But no, she insists on giving him my room. 

I should atleast have a say in whether or not I even want him staying in my room, right? She’s never asked my permission. Where the hell am I supposed to go for three months??

37,1d0lfjw,AITA for inviting my stepmom to my graduation instead of my stepdad?,"My (18F) high school graduation was a couple days ago. In our school you're only allowed to invite 4 people to watch you graduate I guess to prevent people from bringing their whole family. 

Obviously, my mom and dad were two out of four of my invites. Also my grandma has lived with me and my mom all my life and has been a main caregiver in my life so I invited her. Both my parents are married to other people but I chose my stepmom over my stepdad as my fourth invite.

My mom assumed I would be inviting my stepdad over my stepmom and when she found out I had invited my stepmom instead, she was pretty mad. 

We ended up getting into an argument about it with her telling me all the reasons I should have invited my stepdad and telling me I was ungrateful for everything he's done for me.

Her first reason is that I've known my stepdad longer as he and my mom married when I was 3 vs. my stepmom who married my dad 7 years ago. 

She claims my stepdad raised me while my stepmom is more like a friend to me. 

My dad was in the army (Special Forces) when I was young and I didn't see much of him until I was around 9. My mom's always bragging about how my stepdad was around when my dad wasn't and she brought it up again for this argument. I really resent this, my dad was fighting for our country and spent all the time he could with me. On top of this when he got out the army he went out of his way to spend as much time with me as possible and we are very close now.

She tried to make it seem like I wasn't inviting my stepdad because I didn't like him or something. The reality is  I respect my stepdad and his place in my life. But I don't really enjoy him as a person and we both have a sort of shared disinterest in one another that I've learned to not take personally. This isn't me saying he's a bad stepdad, I know I can rely on him to be there for me when I need him, we just don't spend more time than necessary together.

On the other hand, my stepmom and I get on really well. I enjoy spending time with her and she always makes me feel prioritized. I chose my stepmom over my stepdad because I knew it would mean a lot to her and it did. She was really excited to be invited and was filming and taking photos at my graduation. 

My stepdad didn't seem to care about not being invited, it was only my mom who seemed to take it personally. 

My mom's been mostly ignoring me since my graduation and is also mad because today my dad and stepmom are throwing a graduation party for me. She, my stepdad, and all her family have been invited yet she's refusing to attend.

Whenever I spoke against her I would be called disrespectful and she would get mad and throw it in my face how she “always took care of me and sat in the hospital by my bedside and I’m being ungrateful for that.” There was a time I was given 2 years to live but obviously I survived and she once told me she wished the doctors were right and I didn’t make it past those 2 years.

Even while we were on the phone she kept saying “idk why that date feels important to me but oh well I guess it’s not important” and I didnt buy into the bs and just said maybe she’ll remember before she eventually said “oh yeah that’s your birthday isn’t it.”

42,1d0kks5,WIBTA if I refused to to return a Taylor Swift ticket that Stub Hub is demanding back from my co-worker?,"Hey reddit! My (f27) coworker “Emily” (f27) sold me a Taylor Swift Eras Tour ticket last November for one of her shows later this year for $700. Expensive, yes.  But the seats are fantastic - just at the end of the catwalk 7 rows back or something. I have been a huge Taylor Swift fan for a very long time, and I felt like I hit the jackpot when she sold me my ticket because I know how disgustingly overpriced tickets are currently reselling for, especially for her North America shows.

Before Emily sold me the ticket she had it up for sale on Stub Hub for $2700, but nobody bought it. I knew this when buying the ticket and assumed that once I bought the ticket, she’d take it down. A few weeks ago when I saw Emily in the office, she told me that she had forgotten to take the ticket off of Stub Hub when I bought it, and someone else bought it earlier that week. I didn’t think too much of it because I figured that she’d have to just contact Stub Hub to explain that she didn’t have the ticket anymore and that would be that. 

Today, I got a DM from Emily telling me that I need to send the ticket back to her. Apparently, Stub Hub has a policy where if someone sells a ticket they don’t have, they’re on the hook to pay for a similar replacement ticket for the buyer at an equal or greater amount than the price it originally sold for. This means that she’d likely have to pay $2700 or more to Stub Hub for her mistake. She was apologetic, but I am devastated. I’ve grown up listening to Taylor and I am such a huge fan. Going to this concert truly meant so much to me, and I can’t afford to see her anywhere else other than my City. I am so so so sad.

I haven’t answered Emily’s message yet. She has offered to give me half of the sale profit for sending her the ticket back so I can maybe find another ticket, but here is where i may be the asshole. I want to ask her for all of the profit so I can at least have a fighting chance at a nosebleed seat or something.

44,1d0kbvg,WIBTA If I didn't invite my sister to my wedding because she mocked my propsal?,"I F got proposed to on my birthday by my lovely fiance M.
It was a massive surprise and made me so happy, he proposed to me with a cute pink froggy ring which is just a temporary ring as he wanted me to be able to pick a ring myself that he knew I would love to wear which I really appreciate.
I as anyone would told my family about it as I was ecstatic, my older sister who I have little to no relationship with decided to mock the temporary ring and whole ordeal behind my back and didn't think I would find out.
Little context, my older sister has caused many problems in my life with the outstandingly awful decisions she made. She has always only thought about herself and didn't care about the repercussions it would have on everyone else.
She  acts like she cares about me but she is a massive snake and her words are always insincere.
I think I've just about had enough of how she has treated me that I really just do not want her at my wedding anymore, she makes me uncomfortable and I'd rather not spend my day feeling so worked up and anxious.

So would I be the a**hole?

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-25,"WIBTA If I didn't invite my sister to my wedding because she mocked my propsal? I F got proposed to on my birthday by my lovely fiance M.
It was a massive surprise and made me so happy, he proposed to me with a cute pink froggy ring which is just a temporary ring as he wanted me to be able to pick a ring myself that he knew I would love to wear which I really appreciate.
I as anyone would told my family about it as I was ecstatic, my older sister who I have little to no relationship with decided to mock the temporary ring and whole ordeal behind my back and didn't think I would find out.
Little context, my older sister has caused many problems in my life with the outstandingly awful decisions she made. She has always only thought about herself and didn't care about the repercussions it would have on everyone else.
She  acts like she cares about me but she is a massive snake and her words are always insincere.
I think I've just about had enough of how she has treated me that I really just do not want her at my wedding anymore, she makes me uncomfortable and I'd rather not spend my day feeling so worked up and anxious.

So would I be the a**hole?

Edit: so she basically laughed and took the piss out of the ring infront of some of my family.

45,1d0k89o,AITA for saying no to my family?,"Hi. I, 26F will be getting married to my partner,  26F this September. 

We have been planning our big day, and we mutually agreed that we want an intimate wedding. The venue would be at her parent's backyard (it's big enough to fit a wedding tent) to save money and meet our budget. Overall, we have 55 guests coming to the wedding and this includes both our immediate families, and very close friends. 

My partner and I saw my parents, my older brother and his wife a few weeks ago for lunch, and we discussed what we currently have planned for the wedding. Excitedly, my partner and I answered their questions while feeling giddy at the thought of marrying each other and starting our life together. 

When we told them that we were only inviting immediate family and close friends, my mom questioned""Why not invite the aunts, uncles, and cousins to the wedding?""

I said that it's too many people and that we're trying to meet our budget. My mom didn't like that and offered to pay for costs for a different venue, and costs for catering. 

For context: I'm Filipino, and Filipinos have a family-oriented culture where you have to listen to your parents, and in my experience- ALWAYS prioritize family over anything else. Growing up, that has been engraved in my brain. Especially growing up in Canada, where I realized that this mentality that I was taught can be toxic. I've had panic attacks over this my whole life. They can be controlling, and sadly that is part of the culture. It sucks. I love my family, I want them to be happy, but I can't have them control my whole life. 

Last night, my mom sent me a message asking me and my partner to reconsider and that, ""there is just something that's not settling well with me about your decision to not invite my siblings on your wedding day. They would love to see you both say your I do's and be part of your very special day."" I replied with ""Mom, we just want immediate family and close friends. I'm sorry you feel this way, but we can have a celebratory dinner with the extended family sometime after the wedding to compromise."" 

No reply yet from my mom, but my older brother told me that the uncles and aunts were not happy with me. There was a gathering at my parent's house not long ago (my partner and I were not present at that time) where they've been talking behind my back, and questioning me and my partner's decisions. Again, the topic of ""Why is she prioritizing friends over family?"" 

I understand that there would be more friends than family coming to the wedding, but just because we decided it that way doesn't mean I don't love my extended family. I hate this drama, and I feel anxious that my family is hating me for this. I'm starting to question myself about it too. I want to be able to make decisions without anyone making a fuss about it. I talked to my partner about what is going on, and she urged me to stand up for myself, and put my foot down.

46,1d0k6v9,AITA for turning down my dad's fiancée's offer to go wedding dress shopping with her?,"I (18f) was invited to go dress shopping with my dad's current fiancée Natalie (38f). My two sisters (25f and 22f) were invited also. I turned down the offer and Natalie was upset because my sisters also turned her offer down.

We've all been here before So. Many. Times. My dad has been engaged at least 11 times that we know of and married at least four times. He has 7 kids. Not all of us are from marriages. None of us are from the same mom. My mom didn't even know he had kids when she married him. He was a huge liar earlier in his serial marriage life. Mom finding out about his past triggered their divorce. After mom he stopped lying about having kids or being married before. But it didn't stop him from getting into these whirlwind serial relationships and getting engaged and married a bunch.

I don't believe any of his relationships will last more than a few years. Four years was his longest marriage and that was only in the legal sense. He has filed at least one annulment that we're aware of.

At this point none of us plan to go to his future weddings or play pretend in these pre-wedding events. My paternal siblings all feel the same way. None of us really know Natalie or have anything to do with her as a person. I met her once before. Some of my siblings twice. But she's not part of our lives or anything.

After every one of us said no to Natalie she sent a group message to us all saying she expected more from us. That we're about to be family and none of us want to welcome her into the family. She said she has a lot of maternal love to give and would like for us to embrace that and open our minds and hearts to her being more than another of our dad's wives. She said most of us aren't children anymore and even the ones who are could do with being more open to having another mom in their lives. She said she'll be the mother of more siblings one day and for that reason alone we should reconsider how we're treating her.

47,1d0k4xt,AITA for leaving friend at concert after phone died,"
I went to a concert with my friend a few days ago. We had already been bickering a little bit throughout the day and lately we’ve been susceptible to arguments as we’ve both had a lot on our plates. The plan was for us both to get a taxi I pre-booked for about an hour and a half after the concert was finished (midnight) in a specific spot in the town centre

Anyway, about 40 minutes before the concert ended I went outside (still feeling very conscious even if my texts didn’t show it) to get food. I rang a friend to arrange us both meeting up with them instead of going straight home. I texted my friend to see if she wanted to go while I was outside and I think she took this as I was going anyway and would ditch her if she didn’t want to go. I went back to the stadium to try and find her but she kept moving closer to the front throughout the night so I couldn’t find her. Then all of the sudden I got a headache, was struggling to hear and just lost a bit of control over my mind so I decided to wait outside the stadium. I stopped drinking at this point.

The problem was my phone was about to die, so I sent her a message saying that I was outside the nearest pub so that she could meet me however, my phone died before the message reached her (sent but not delivered). I waited about 10-20 minutes for her after the concert finished and she didn’t show up. And she replied to my messages while my phone died. It’s worth noting that she met up with her neighbour and their friends at the concert just before I went outside and a relative was there that she could have called (something I already advised her she could do earlier in the night when we already lost each other once). 

With this in mind I decided to leave the stadium area and walk to town centre to try and get some cash out and get home another way (so I could get home asap and so she could jump in the taxi I booked). However I forgot to take my debit card out. Thankfully I was able to charge my phone for 2 minutes at a pub nearby paying for their power pack so I could track the taxi but not enough charge to call my friend (2% batter). I ultimately went to just get the taxi I booked in advance, my friend wasn’t there.

So I got home, texted and called my friend as I was worried about her and she said she walked home alone. Then I got some rather abusive messages from her when I tried to explain what happened and she accusing me of cancelling the taxi. I understand her getting pissed off at me but I feel like I couldn’t have done much more to avoid the situation once I was already outside to grab my food other than waiting at the front of the stadium 

I still feel guilty about the situation. I left my friend in a vulnerable position but I feel like I was in a vulnerable position also. I also know she had cash to jump in a taxi as she didnt pay for any drinks at the stadium (not something she should have had to do). It sucks that our friendship might end over this.

51,1d0jmu5,AITA for forgetting my friends birthday?,"I (19m) forgot my now (19m) friends birthday. Happy late birthday. I knew my friend bday was coming up but I wasn’t sure when exactly it was. I tried checking calendars and journals I owned before but I couldn’t find it. 

When I met with him at another point I asked if he had anything planned which he said he didn’t. I was kind of hoping to get a bit more info on when exactly it is. 

I’m terrible with birthdays and hate myself for it. I only remember my dad and sisters bdays because they were my DS password and bike lock. (Please don’t hack my DS🥴). I wasn’t sure if my friends birthday was may or June. I confuse his birthday with my mom’s for some reason and assumed his was June. 

I wanted to confirm and not mess up the date so I asked his sister what his bday is. She said “10th”. I should’ve assumed she meant the 10th of the month coming but I was worried she might just not wanna give me the month cause I should know as his friend. 

During this time I got a girlfriend, had to start working more shifts at work and was approaching my colleges final major project. I basically didn’t message my friends for the month and if I did it was very brief. 

At work I realised I’d missed my friends bday by 13 days. I felt terrible and started asking my college friends for advice. Most people said it isn’t a big deal and just to say sorry. I wanted to make a song in the style of Steven universe(his fave show) about how I appreciate him and I’m sorry, but my friend thought that was a bit over the top.

I would have also liked to buy a gift that cost 1 GBP for every day late I was to say happy bday. I’m pretty tight financially atm though because I wanted to save up for a trip w me and my gf.

After I messaged my friend he didn’t read my message. I messaged his sister and she wasn’t pleased with me either. I started asking around w my friend group and it turns out most of them are annoyed w me for not messaging them over the month.

I am not a big texter and like to talk over a call  so it’s not that weird for me to not message. But they mentioned they would have liked an explanation of why I was gone or at least check ins over message. This was from one friend on behalf of everyone though because most weren’t communicating with me.

I went to comic con today and felt miserable trying to think of a solution. I keep losing friend groups and I can’t tell if I’m a horrible friend, the friend group I’m in don’t share the same quality time/communication as me, or if it’s just an age thing where we’re all young and immature and not good with each other. 

My mom and sister both said I’ve been mature and tried to resolve it. They said I have my own life and fell in love so they should be understanding with how I have tried to communicate. I feel bad for my gf too who has had to see me drained at what should be a fun day for her and me.

(Also, me and my gf cosplay Leon and Ada for those who care)",Asshole,2024-05-25,"AITA for forgetting my friends birthday? I (19m) forgot my now (19m) friends birthday. Happy late birthday. I knew my friend bday was coming up but I wasn’t sure when exactly it was. I tried checking calendars and journals I owned before but I couldn’t find it. 

When I met with him at another point I asked if he had anything planned which he said he didn’t. I was kind of hoping to get a bit more info on when exactly it is. 

I’m terrible with birthdays and hate myself for it. I only remember my dad and sisters bdays because they were my DS password and bike lock. (Please don’t hack my DS🥴). I wasn’t sure if my friends birthday was may or June. I confuse his birthday with my mom’s for some reason and assumed his was June. 

I wanted to confirm and not mess up the date so I asked his sister what his bday is. She said “10th”. I should’ve assumed she meant the 10th of the month coming but I was worried she might just not wanna give me the month cause I should know as his friend. 

During this time I got a girlfriend, had to start working more shifts at work and was approaching my colleges final major project. I basically didn’t message my friends for the month and if I did it was very brief. 

At work I realised I’d missed my friends bday by 13 days. I felt terrible and started asking my college friends for advice. Most people said it isn’t a big deal and just to say sorry. I wanted to make a song in the style of Steven universe(his fave show) about how I appreciate him and I’m sorry, but my friend thought that was a bit over the top.

I would have also liked to buy a gift that cost 1 GBP for every day late I was to say happy bday. I’m pretty tight financially atm though because I wanted to save up for a trip w me and my gf.

53,1d0iglh,AITA for calling my dad a dick for supporting my sister's business but not mine?,"5 years ago, my sister (25 at the time) decided she wanted to open a preschool. My dad was completely on board, helped her pick out a piece of land, bought the land, got her set up with a modular building company, paid for the building, donated supplies, and paid for everything for the first year. Every year his company donates thousands of dollars to her school. They provide backpacks, lunchboxes, and water bottles to each of her students every year, they donate food on special occasions, they fund graduation every year, and they provide teacher gifts for Christmas and ed of the year. She talked about wanting to expand and his company donated a whole ass building and new playground. 

I (27f) want to open a salon. I asked my dad to help me open it like he did with my sister's school. He recommended I spend a few more years working then he'll consider it. 

I reminded him that he helped my sister when she was 2 years younger than me but he said it's different because she started babysitting at 11, working at a swim school at 13, started working with preschoolers at summer camps by 15, and got a job as a preschool teacher fresh out of high school. He also said she had a good understanding of how the business would work and had great ideas for location and specialization to attract parents.

I told him I do have good ideas but he's just not willing to listen and spend half of what he did on my sister on my business. 

He said the only way he'll reconsider is if I get at least an associates in business, get a job in my field and keep it for 3+ years, and save at least half of the start up costs. All of this has to happen within 4 years. 

We got into an argument and I called him a dick for supporting my sister and spending tens or hundreds of thousands on her business but either refusing or making me jump through hoops for me to get half of what she got. He says I'm being ungrateful and unrealistic and can't expect something just because my sister has it.

55,1d0i8a7,AITA for not apologizing,"A group of friends of mine turned 40 last year and wanted to plan something fun to do. The basic consensus was to go on a cruise. I helped plan the cruise and I had talked to my friend's husband to see if he would join us (he doesn't like being around large groups of people so I wasn't sure if he would come) and he said 'No I am planning my own events for my birthday this year' (he was turning 50). So when I sent out the planning email, I didn't include him on the email since he said he wasn't interested.

After the email was sent, I noticed he was being particularly cold to me. I dismissed it as he can be moody sometimes. But after awhile it was noticeable. He would constantly talk  
over me, interrupt me when I was talking to someone and start having his own  
conversation with them. He also had an issue with anything I did (from how I  
sat, when I sat, what I said, what I did). He planned a lot of events for his  
birthday (he has a lot of money) that I wasn't invited to. The one I was  
invited to, he heard I was on antibiotics and tried to encourage me not to come  
the day of because I was 'sick' (if you didn't want me there, then why did you  
invite me?). He also gaslit me into thinking we were invited to a birthday  
dinner when we were never told about it (he said 'we just forgot'). I was  
confused but thought maybe it would pass and withdrew from them for a bit. I  
didn't know what his issue was but I thought if he had an issue, he would talk  
to me and tell me like an adult. I found out later that the reason he is angry  
is because I didn't include him on the email for the cruise (now this is 6  
months later). Honestly, I thought that if I did include him he would be angry  
because he told me he wasn't interested.

I was disappointed when I found out the email was the reason as I wasn’t being mean intentionally. However, he has continued to be intentionally mean and cruel to me rather than telling me his issue and it hasn't stopped. There are a few times I thought he  
may have moved on but then he does something mean again (my husband and I were  
recently invited to a birthday dinner for him, but then he said it was  
cancelled, and I am pretty sure it wasn't). I've thought about apologizing but  
at this point I don't want to due to his childish and mean behavior. If he  
treats someone like this 'because of an email', I'm not sure I want to be  
friends with someone like that. Friendship is about honestly and I feel if he

We are still fighting this because the kids are in a bad place and the 4 year old is having to start therapy now after being kicked out of 2 daycares under moms care. All of the kids are under 6.

Well in March his ex took us back to court and managed to double his child support because she put the kids in a more expensive daycare and that made things even more difficult.
So he is changing companies to try make more money and im still going to school full time and working part time. 2 weeks ago he turned around and told me I need to work at least 30 hours a week so we can pay bills and keep ontop of things which I normally wouldnt have a problem with but I took a condensed semester for school from May to June because he wanted me to be off for the summer with the kids.

Last week this girl who isn’t part of my friend group but sits next to me in 2 classes and is quite friendly with me was throwing a sweet 16th birthday party at her house and said I should come and bring my friends. My friends and I are more introverted and don’t really go to many parties, but I convinced everyone to go because we couldn’t just stay inside all the time and miss out on crucial high school experiences.

We planned on getting ready together and helping each other choose outfits and do our makeup. One of my friends “Nikki” said that she was going to the party, but she couldn’t get ready with us because she had plans to hang out with her friends from out of school. We agreed that we would get ready without Nikki while she hung out with her friends, and all 8 of us would meet up at the party. So the 7 of us went to the party, and a while later, Nikki also arrived with 2 of her friends from out of school.

Another girl in our friend group “Ellie” has autism. She agreed to come to the party but brought noise cancelling headphones. Around 30 minutes into the party she says she we should go home, but the rest of us were having fun and we didn’t want it to end so soon. We went into the garden for a few minutes to get some fresh air, which Ellie said made her feel better.

There was alcohol at the party and Nikki got drunk, but not so drunk that she had trouble walking/talking. Nikki also ended up taking drugs, which caused a huge argument when Ellie said she was concerned for Nikki. After this, Nikki ended up drifting away from us for the rest of the party. Sometime later, we saw Nikki hanging out with the popular girls and flirting with a guy.

Eventually everything must have gotten too much for Ellie, and she ended up having a panic attack. She said all the lights and music and sounds were too overstimulating. After helping her through her panic attack, I suggested we take an Uber to Ellie’s house and spend the rest of the night just watching anime and playing video games like we usually do.

We went to get Nikki, but we saw that she was still flirting with the guy and I didn’t want to block her chances. I hadn’t seen those 2 friends she came in with since they arrived, but I figured that they would be going home with her since they came together. I texted her that we were leaving and then left the party.

I told her sorry but she was mad at us and wasn’t even hanging out with us at that point so I assumed she wouldn’t want to leave with us either. She burst into tears and said I was an awful friend, and I said I was only looking out for Ellie and I didn’t mean to ‘abandon’ her.

I asked her if she was sure she wasn’t missing out someone, but she assured me there were only 19 kids in her class, and I was just misremembering.

Fast forward to her birthday, and this girl “Kamilla” shows up with an entire box full of gifts: teddy bears, perfume, candles, nail polish, flowers, chocolates, etc. I remembered picking up my from school at the beginning of the school year and seeing her chatting and being very friendly with Kamilla, so I assumed they were quite good friends. When Kamilla went up to hug my daughter and wish her a happy birthday, she lightly pushed her away and told Kamilla she couldn’t attend as we forgot to book her place. I apologised to Kamilla and her mother and offered to talk to the people in charge and pay for her place, but my daughter insisted that Kamilla couldn’t come. Kamilla was very distraught over this and started sobbing.

I pulled my daughter aside and asked her why Kamilla couldn’t join, even though they used to be friendly and she’d invited every other student in her year. She said that Kamilla was just really weird, obsessive, and creepy, and she didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. I asked her if Kamilla was bullying her, and she said no, she just didn’t want to be around Kamilla. Kamilla’s mother had found out about the party through another parent and Kamilla decided to surprise my daughter knowing she hadn’t been given an invite.

I returned the gifts to Kamilla, apologised again, and gently told her that there weren’t enough spaces. Her mother started screaming at me, telling me that I was a grown adult woman bullying a preteen girl. I told her that it was my daughter’s birthday party, she could invite whoever she wanted. She accused me of raising my daughter to be a bully, and that she couldn’t just invite the entire class and exclude one girl. She claimed that Kamilla was my daughter’s “best friend” and she had to right to be invited.

I told her that my daughter’s a teenager, not a 5 year old, she can’t be forced to invite the entire class just to be nice. I said that I didn’t want to raise a doormat. I didn’t want to teach her to value the feelings of others at the expense of her own - if my daughter feels uncomfortable around someone, then I prioritise HER wellbeing over that of a stranger’s.

Kamilla’s mother is now talking to the teachers to punish my daughter for “bullying”. I’ve tried explaining to her that my daughter was simply setting her boundaries, she shouldn’t have to face consequences for that.

But mom never explicitly said that she wanted to date/remarry, all she said that she feels old, she don’t have zeal for any hobby, and my wife took it as loneliness and started convincing her to go out and start dating!

My BIL & nephew also told her to back off, but she wouldn't let the matter drop. So when I finally had the chance to go, I left without saying a word. I still haven’t mentioned it, & don't plan to at all.
* I recently learned that I’m being downsized from my job. Since I'm not ready to retire, I see this as a chance to explore something new, professionally.

I'm pretty sure my dad has picked on this and tries to make up for it and everyone picks on that. 

So anyway my older brother was rushed to the hospital this morning for an emergency surgery, I'm not gonna go into to much detail but it's not serious, just a minor surgery. My parents usually have medical aid but they cancelled it recently because the one they had didn't cover dental (I have braces) and my father is in the process of getting a new one.

I'm pretty sure my dad has picked on this and tries to make up for it and everyone picks on that. 

So anyway my older brother was rushed to the hospital this morning for an emergency surgery, I'm not gonna go into to much detail but it's not serious, just a minor surgery. My parents usually have medical aid but they cancelled it recently because the one they had didn't cover dental (I have braces) and my father is in the process of getting a new one.

69,1d0fj61,AITA for remarking that my sister's fiance isn't her usual type ?,"I (24F) have a sister (26F) that just got proposed to by her 1 year long boyfriend (27M). In the past my sister used to date masculine looking buff men, the military type essentially, while her fiance is much more feminine than all of her exes, wearing earrings on both ears, having painted nails and even being shorter in height than my sister. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely still cute, but if you'd knew my sister, you'd definitely wouldn't expect her to date someone as feminine as her fiance.

When they announced their engagement I expressed my surprise over my sister getting married to someone that isn't her usual type. My sister said that I'm wrong and that her fiance is her perfect type on paper. I laughed a bit over this comment and she asked me what was so funny. I told her that everyone knows her type are masculine military looking men as that's how all of her exes look like and that her fiance is the outliner in her dating history.

My sister that all her exes are exes cause they weren't her actual type and then her fiance said something about how thinks he can be as masculine for his girl as these dudes were, at which I laughed again. At this point both my sister and her fiance start getting defensive and calling me disrespectful and accuse me of pot stirring in order to ruin their engagement announcement and even our mom took their side, telling me that I shouldn't have brought up her past exes just as my sister announced that she's getting married.

Personally I don't think what I said should've been that big of a deal and I think both my sister and fiance got defensive over my sister only liking masculine dudes in the past, which are clearly the complete opposite of her fiance and our mom was just trying to defuse the tension cause she knows my sister is usually the sensitive one in our family.

70,1d0fb59,AITA for encouraging my children do disrespect their uncle?,"In 2013, my mother was a new widow, and we bought out her remaining mortgage on her home. Mom has been living in that home since but now has Parkinson's. My brother Nate moved in to help take care of her. Nate had a home health background, so I thought it would be great. 

My daughter(17) Sky picked up my son (19) Parker, from college. My family and I were going on vacation for Memorial Day. 

Parker and Sky made a slight detour to see their grandma. It was about 7 pm, and the house was dark, and they let themselves in. The place was disgusting. As a teenager, Sky started a livestream and bad-mouthed her uncle, who was supposed to care for my mother and the house. They get to the kitchen, and moldy dishes and bugs are everywhere. My brother comes out screaming at my children for trespassing and ripping my daughter's phone out of her hand and throwing it. 

My daughter's friends and a cousin on my hubby's side see it, and the police are called. I’m called, and instead of making our flight for our trip, we are cleaning up my mom’s home. Thankfully my mom’s room was clean, and her bathroom also, but my brother let the house go to shit and hasn't been cleaning or doing dishes unless he knew we were coming over and we should show up. I reminded him it is technically our home, and we paid off the mortgage taxes. The deeds and title are in my name, so my kids can stop by and visit their granny whenever they want. 

Nate goes into how Sky recorded him and the home, making him look bad. He may face some legal issues of neglect because of what people are saying on TikTok, and the police did come to talk to my brother about it. So instead of going away for the weekend cruise, my family is out thousands of dollars and is pissed at Nate. Nate is angry at Sky.
My mother is. My husband wants to evict my brother and get a private nurse because my brother can no longer be trusted in “our” home to take care of mom. 

My brother acts like he forgot we bought out the home and saying the situation isn't fair to him because he was acting like mom told him he could have her house for taking care of her and doesn't know what is really going on and he’s been fighting with Sky and Parker. Sky refuses to help us clean if Nate is there and my husband wants to press changes and sue my brother but I want to first clean up the house and focus on mom and all sides are mad at me.

Update: I told my husband we will start contacting lawyers on Monday. I feel like the police will be involved because there has been multiple wellness checks on the house as my husband I clean. My son has been sitting with my mom and a social worker came buy and talked to her and both police and social worker has talked to family members.

Background: my mom and I don't have a great relationship. I'm the oldest of her 3 kids.  I don't have kids but was the first to buy a house.  It took her almost a year to come see it.  Didn't help me move but helped my sister move across the county and then to Marylandand got her church to help.  She's been her once in 3 years.  Sees my other in town sibling all the time and goes to Maryland from Ohio once a year to see my other sis.

I found some old license plates.  I then started buying old plates to cover my workroom walks when I finally bought a house.  I finally started that project and posted a picture.  My mom asked for a specific set of plates of my grandpa's if I came across them.  I don't know why she knew this plate number yet. She had her chance.

72,1d0erpl,AITA for refusing to pay my intrusive coworker back for a gift she got me months ago?,"For context I’ve asked a few people if I should pay her, & I’ve gotten split answers.
I (23f) was working next to another vendor (63f) from November 23 to March 24. In that time we became close & she started treating me like a daughter (she has a medical condition known as MS & never had children even though she wanted them) During casual conversation, she asked where I lived, because she thought we might be neighbors, & I told her the name of my apartment complex which was a BIG mistake. One day I came into work & she said “wow you look tired” I was EXHAUSTED because I was in a bad living situation with the noisiest neighbors you could imagine, by this time, I had put in three complaints to my apartment management, so I told her “I am tired” she asked why, I briefly explained the situation & she seemed more irritated than I was. She kindly gifted me earplugs & I thanked her. After that, every time we worked on the same day, she asked me if my neighbors were still being loud, they were, so I was honest & said yes & that the earplugs weren’t helping. She seemed even MORE angry, & suggested we start leaving bad reviews for the complex, contacting the higher management, knocking on their door/leaving a note, etc. at this point I started to get weary of why she was so involved, & told her I would handle it. Next thing I know, she calls me while I’m at work, she knows my schedule, & I was with a customer. When she called I picked up, she quickly asked “what’s your apartment number?” Before I could fully process, I responded with the number, & she thanked me & hung up. After I was finished with the customer & I processed what she had asked, I called her & asked her why she needed my address. She jokingly said, oh I just wanted to know where you lived & I ran into one of your neighbors. I just brushed it off & went back to work since she was a very kind lady. When I got home, my neighbor across from me asked if she could speak to me & looked TERRIFIED, to make a long story short, she spoke to me for 3 hours, her story was that she (the neighbor) asked her (the coworker) if she needed help finding anything, then noticed my coworker had a gun sticking out of her jacket. My coworker told her she was with the police (impersonating is a felony) intimidating & threatening her, saying she needs to tell the neighbors to be quiet, & that if they refuse, the police will get involved. Coworker took a picture of my neighbor, as well as vehicles in complex, & left. After speaking with my neighbor I sent her a message stating the following.
“ Hey (coworker) when I got home, my neighbor that you spoke to came out & talked to me. She was very concerned & felt unsafe. She said you impersonated a police officer,(which is a felony) that you said they were severely harassing us, she said that you were very aggressive & threatening, so she’s gonna report you to management as well as the apartment security complex. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about or who you were, & that I had just put noise complaints in but that was it. I said I would send my noise complaint to security as well as let them know that she (the neighbor you spoke to) told me about someone suspicious in the complex. Please don’t come back, if she sees you & calls the police & tells them you impersonated an officer you could get arrested for that as well as stalking (she claimed you said you’ve been watching all of us for weeks). Anyways thank you for your concern & for your help but we are just going to set up an appointment with management & ask them about getting out of our lease & moving as soon as possible. I appreciate you trying to help, but I don’t want any confrontation or anyone to get into any trouble, talking to her was terrifying, so we can handle it from here. You’re great & I really do appreciate your support. I’ll see you soon.” 
I was trying to be as nice as possible since I still had to see her often & I did end up telling the neighbor that I knew her & that it’s taken care of.
Right after I sent that message she called me laughing, said my neighbor was exaggerating, & told me a whole different story. She said she claimed she was a PI, not an officer, & wasn’t being aggressive at all. I pointed out that she said my coworker took pictures of her & vehicles & she admitted to it, & tried to justify it. My neighbor went over her story multiple times & nothing changed, so I believe the neighbor. Fast forward a few weeks, my membership to the store we work in expired, & I needed a battery for my truck because my work required me to drive long distance for a work event. I was going to leave work early to go to a different store to get one, but my coworker offered to get it for me on her membership since it was cheaper. I thanked her, we went & got it, & I turned in my old battery so she could get some money back for it. At first she told me I could make payments to her, & I told her I could afford it. I handed her the money in cash when she started to tell me to keep it. I interrupted her & said “NO. I can afford it, keep the money, I’m not going to argue with you.” & walked away, at the end of her shift, she walked over to me, shoved the cash down my shirt, & said to keep it. That it was a gift from her.
At the work event I mentioned earlier, I told my supervisor about the apartment situation, I told her I was concerned about coworkers health, & asked if I should call in a wellness check or something, I also told supervisor that I knew she didn’t have any family & that I was extremely concerned about her. My supervisor just told me to keep it professional, & not to share anything personal.

About a month ago, my coworker texted me saying I disrespected her by telling my supervisor, that it was confidential, & that she no longer wants to be friends. I asked her if she wanted the money for the battery back, she sent the following message.
“ You don’t get it it’s not about paying me back that was a gift that the Lord asked me to do and I do what the Lord asked me. I would never ask back for that. I’m glad that I can help you and your boyfriend out so I remember being at your age sometimes it’s really tough with finances so I don’t expect anything back. Have a great life.”
I sent back “you too, take care”
Last week she sent me a message saying she hopes I’m well, & asked for the money back, I sent
“ Thank you, I appreciate that. I’m sorry, but unfortunately I can’t give you money, we had over $6,000 in moving expenses this month. I’m sorry you are tight on money, but I tried to pay you for it twice & you didn’t accept the money. I am working in (store) again so I will see you around. Have a great day
She said “Im in a tough financial situation. I think we can work together as friends on this, I am just asking for some compassion.”
I sent her a screenshot of her previous message saying she’d never ask for the money back & said “ I’m really sorry to hear that you are in a tough situation, that’s really unfortunate. Even if I had the money to give you, I can’t. I gave you the money in full the day of, as well as asked if you wanted the money on the day you decided to end the friendship (without even caring to ask for my side of the story), so unfortunately I can’t help you. Here is what you said. (Insert screenshot) I’m not going to give you a call, but I hope your circumstances improve. Take care.”
She responded with “you’re a fucking thief, god sees this”
I said “ I’m sorry you feel that way, but that’s why there are laws regarding this. I offered you money, you refused twice & said it was a gift. I’m not trying to be disrespectful to you.

73,1d0ed9s,AITA wife’s ex husband continues to play a large part in our lives,"She was married to him for years and she has 2 children of her own but they never had a biological child together. The kids biological dad is a chump so they naturally developed a loving relationship with my wife’s ex husband because he did do things for the kids their dad wouldn’t do. They have been divorced for 5 years and we have been seeing each other for that long. Parenting and coparenting are all new subjects for me that I’m trying to navigate. I digress—

I took him in when he didn’t want to live in his friend’s house anymore and couldn’t stand living there anymore. Beforehand I had asked if he had a stable job before he could move in to help with rent but he said he needed to leave as soon as possible and would find a job as soon as he moved in. He said he would only stay for 3 weeks so he could get back on his feet. (more like 3 months and going)

He doesn’t have a healthy relationship with his parents so he wouldn’t go back to them…ever. In the first month he had moved in with me i’d ask him if he applied for jobs and he’d say yeah and is just waiting for a call back. He never got a job. He would sometimes go with a friend to do some farm work to get some money. But hasn’t gotten an actual job and it’s been over 3 months.

I come home and he’s just laid down on the couch with the AC on which kinda irritates me. It’s been 3 months since he’s moved in and i want to kick him out truthfully.

I told her how it's a waste of time and energy and that I would much rather they speak whatever they want because I know myself and what they say doesn't subtract anything from my life. They don't mean anything to me and their words matter less.

She kept on insisting that I defend and speak up for myself but I don't feel like it. She says how I can't go through life letting people step all over me, that she was only trying to help me speak up for myself and how it's so unfair that I am telling her this when she was only trying to defend me.

76,1d0d6ww,AITA for refusing to share batch cooked food with my sister?,"I'm (27f) a mom of two with my third on the way. To make life easier and because I work from home (self employed) around my kids that means my husband or I will batch cook and freeze a lot of food so we're not super stressed about how we're eating. Typically we will batch cook 1-2x a week and store it on our large freezer. We have more than enough to keep us going for a while. I bring this up because it might be relevant info for some.

Anyway, my sister (36f) has two kids of her own. We're not close but last month her husband was in the hospital for a week and as a favor to my parents I babysat my sister's kids. She was okay with this and even though I never met her children before it went well. But after my sister's husband got home from the hospital she called me up and told me she couldn't believe the kids ate so much at my house and what the hell was I feeding them. I gave a rough list of the things they ate, she scoffed at it and then ended our call. I was rolling my eyes so hard at her for this.

Apparently between then and two days ago she had spoken to our parents who mentioned that I balance all the stuff I give my kids and they let my sister know her kids would have eaten some kind of veggie at my house. Seems they don't really go for fruits or veggies easily but especially veggies. With this information my sister reached out again and told me to send her a bunch of the food I have in my freezer because she's tired of her kids not eating their veggies and if she has to do it 'my dumb way' then she will until her husband is back on his feet. I told her after the way she demanded I send her food and after the insulting way she did it too, the answer was no. I told her she doesn't get to treat me like crap and then expect favors. She told me I could easily spare some since our parents made it sound like I make a lot of food in advance and I should be willing to help out family.

I told her I already helped and my answer was no to more help. She grew more annoyed and told me I was a selfish little brat and hung up on me. Yesterday she texted me to say she hopes I'm proud of myself for not helping out.

For those who'll ask why we're not close. My sister judged me for getting pregnant in my 20s, she didn't think I could be a good mom because we don't share the same parenting opinions and she was so rude about all this. She was setting me up to fail and I can't get over that. Plus she has always acted like I'm just a screw up and a baby and that's not true.

78,1d0cdyr,WIBTA to stop running my homebrew dnd campaign? ,"I (20f) have been running a homebrew dnd campaign for a few months now, this campaign started off years ago but recently I revived it with two of the old players and two new players. It has been going well for the most part but I’m starting to debate whether I want to continue running it at all. 

I have helped some of the players make their characters and some of them have in world things that they have asked me to have control over (gods patrons and the such) and some thing they wouldn’t know from their backstories. I have regularly asked the players what they do and do not want to know about their backstory and how they want backstory related stuff to be run, so I could get this right for them. This worked at the start of the campaign, but now two players are causing massive issues that have left me disheartened.

One player continually requests information about their character that they previously told me they didn’t want to know, and then will change their mind sporadically on aspects of the character and how they want them to be played. This has ended up with me having to rewrite the entity/god that was controlling/messing with them because they asked for it to be rewritten since they didn’t like how it was being played, only for them to say they actually liked the old idea and are sad it was spoiled and changed.

The other player has started frequently shutting down during session when things don’t go their way, becoming cold and distant when something isn’t the way they envisioned. This could be me interrupting long conversations or playing scenes they were looking forward to wrong, and when they shut down I find it difficult to try and include them in the session and I’m finding this really difficult to deal with. They have also started making some unpleasant passive aggressive comments recently, which is why I have began questioning how much of this is on me and my DMing.

I am far from the perfect DM, there are many things in this campaign I have done wrong, patched together, flexed the rules too much or been too lenient, but I have been learning about a lot of these things through one of the players who the others complain to instead of talking to me about it, despite me asking. This lead to us arguing about the game and player behaviour but both of us are dealing with some stressful background issues right now, so I don’t want to allot any blame on this.

I decided to take a couple months break due to exams and an overwhelming amount of work, but as we are getting towards the end of that break players are looking to organise a game and I am getting more and more stressed over the idea of running it again. I’m worried it will create just more drama and upset and drive me closer to a breakdown again.

Would I be an asshole for stopping the game, and how would I do so without hurting people and friendships?

79,1d0cbfq,AITA for leaving food in the sink?,"Sounds weird but let me explain. 

I (23M) am roommates with  Roman (23M) in San Francisco. We both graduated college last December and the company we work at set up a new hire exchange where we met and found we had a lot in common, we both like working out, we have similar degrees, and we both frequently have side projects taking up most of our time. However I think the main difference between us is college. 

I moved far from home for university. Throughout 4.5 years in college I’ve had 10 roommates (6 of them were in a seven person flat for a 6-month study abroad, 2 I crashed with during a summer internship with this company, and 2 from the frat I lived in) and I’ve had great relationships with all of them. Were they perfect? No. We had disagreements and they were generally small but were resolved as at the end of the day we were friends. I’ve never been the perfect roommate, but I’ve always made an effort to be understanding and correct my behavior. 

Roman however lived with his parents throughout university and I’m his first roommate. I know his parents did a lot for him based off the stuff he doesn’t know. He thought he was using fabric softener for a month before I told him that he was using regular detergent, and he didnt want to pay for a cheese grater on the grounds that he has one (he doesn't, he has a zester. I was making a meal my grandma always made for me to cope with her terminal diagnosis and I didnt have the energy to correct him). stuff like that. i mostly dont mind because this is small stuff not worth bringing up. 

Roman and I have our disagreements and while they are resolved they're rarely resolved in a way I'm satisfied with. I've apologized for genuine mistakes (I once let eggs stay in trash too long and smelled up the apartment, my bad), but I don't think he has ever given an apology that hasnt gone along the lines of ""I'm sorry but you understand where im coming from?"". 

Now to the reason I'm making this post. roman is REALLY anal about food in the sink. I'm very diligent about cleaning my dishes (always within an hour after I'm done eating/cooking) but sometimes I'm up late or just exhausted and forget to take out the small scraps of food that collect in the hole cover thingy. I don't think it's a big deal as roman will leave dishes in sink all day/night, which isn't an issue as he'll usually get to it or sometimes I clean these dishes as theyre in my way/I'm already cleaning. Plus he is either in a live game or programming so it's not worth it to bother him. (plus, why not do something nice?)

but he always interrupts me when I'm on my laptop working to tell me about. at first it was whatever, I'm either watching youtube or working on something that can be paused and I shouldn't leave food in the sink anyway (again, my bad), plus it takes ten seconds so why argue?

I've been good about it lately but last week it happened and now I think he's the problem. I woke up early to take him to work so that after work I could drop him off at the airport for a two week trip. we usually drive separately and he goes into work earlier than I do but he wanted to leave his car at the apartment. as I'm putting shoes on he comes out of kitchen giving me attitude about food in the sink. I was up late and I was still coping with my grandma's diagnosis and missed it. 

hes like ""how many times have I told you about this?"" (like ten times over six months) ""it feels like you leave it for me to clean"" (he says this every time despite that I've made it clear that this is not the case) ""I just cleaned this for you yesterday"" (fair, but he's still going away for two weeks so why make a stink?)

I took the ten seconds it takes to clean but it left me seething with rage.  I've been in anger management and know screaming doesn't resolve anything so I took him to work, thought about what I wanted to say, and talked with him. It ended the same way as before with him saying ""I'm sorry but you understand where I'm coming from?""

I've tried to be patient and understanding but I'm tired. my grandma died a few days ago and I can't tell if my anger and frustration is justified. I've never been so angry about something so stupid and I don’t know if it’s because he’s problematic or if I need to grieve.

80,1d0arsr,AITA for not letting my brother stay at my place,"A little backstory, so I moved to a different city a couple years ago but since last September I’ve been living on my own flat (it’s a 2B). Ever since I moved to my new place, my brother has come up to visit me every month or every two months, and he usually only stays for a few days. Me (21f) and my brother (20m), haven’t always gotten along, we used to fight a lot as kids but our relationship got better when I first moved, but now that I’m living alone and he visits often we fight every time. The thing is my brother is a zaza smoker and he smokes at the window or sometimes even inside the room he stays in. This bothers me a lot. I’ve tried talking to him about it with no luck. When he was here in January he called saying he was coming the next day… with a friend… I freaked out a little bit but I said ok and got their room ready. The thing is, they only came here to party and left the house a mess. They did their best at doing the dishes, which I appreciate of course, but they ate all my food, didn’t take out their own trash, left the room untidy etc. When my brother visited again in february, he didn’t bring a friend with him from back home, no no, he brought 3 friends!!!

AITA for not wanting my brother and his friend to come over next week?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-25,"AITA for not letting my brother stay at my place A little backstory, so I moved to a different city a couple years ago but since last September I’ve been living on my own flat (it’s a 2B). Ever since I moved to my new place, my brother has come up to visit me every month or every two months, and he usually only stays for a few days. Me (21f) and my brother (20m), haven’t always gotten along, we used to fight a lot as kids but our relationship got better when I first moved, but now that I’m living alone and he visits often we fight every time. The thing is my brother is a zaza smoker and he smokes at the window or sometimes even inside the room he stays in. This bothers me a lot. I’ve tried talking to him about it with no luck. When he was here in January he called saying he was coming the next day… with a friend… I freaked out a little bit but I said ok and got their room ready. The thing is, they only came here to party and left the house a mess. They did their best at doing the dishes, which I appreciate of course, but they ate all my food, didn’t take out their own trash, left the room untidy etc. When my brother visited again in february, he didn’t bring a friend with him from back home, no no, he brought 3 friends!!!

81,1d0ak2q,AITA for not giving my sister half of my gambling winnings?,"I (29 M) and my sister (24 F) were on a cruise with our family. Our step siblings (who we are not close with - there’s no animosity, we just never lived together as a family and were always 1000+ miles apart) and us killed time by going to the casino. Just playing video poker. Not winning or losing too much money. 

One evening, as we were leaving the casino, we were walking by the roulette table and my sister turns to me and says, “You should put money down on 19.”

I don’t know what cause her to suggest this, but I shrugged and threw $5 on 19. And it hit! As I was being giving my $175, my sister immediately demanded half of it! She said since she gave me the idea, half of the money was rightfully hers. 

I refused, saying that if she wanted to win money, she should have risked her own money. After all, she wasn’t about to give me $2.50 if I lost. 

This caused a HUGE fight between us, souring the rest of the trip. The rest of the family mostly stayed out of it, but it made things uncomfortable at times, which wasn’t cool particularly since we hardly see (or know) some of them. 

I agree, that a nice gesture would have been to buy her a drink or something along those lines, but her immediate insistence that I give her half of the money even prevented me from doing that. So… am I the asshole for not giving my sister anything?

82,1d0afct,AITA for telling my sister off for how she uses my tablet and changing the unlock pattern to it,"So last year, I (18f) got a Samsung tablet last year as a birthday present with a small compromise of sharing it with my siblings every now and then, mainly my sister (30f) and one of my brothers (29m) and I was okay with that as long as they took care of it like I did and I still had the last say.

Unfortunately, my sister has a history of breaking things like her high-end PC, our brother's motorcycle, our brother's netbook and my laptop and even a few phone stands and chargers. She even takes and uses stuff without asking which drives me up the wall because I always ask permission to use or borrow stuff to make sure no one else needs it and if it's food, that weren't saving it for later.

Now about 3 weeks ago, I allowed her to borrow my tablet which was a bad decision in my opinion. I give it to her at around 60-90% charged and every time she returns it, it's usually at 20% and a few times, she returned it with 2% and it's always overheating because of the streaming app she's using (Livestream app where you gain points per hour and can convert it to money) and it's constantly running in the background unless you force stop the app in the settings. She also takes it without asking when I'm asleep.

I've told her off (clearly annoyed) about returning it nearly dead and overheating, as well as about taking it while I'm sleeping because I use it all day at school for notes, viewing presentations and writing papers while I'm on campus and unfortunately, my campus does not have easy access to outlets. She only has 1 charger so she can't charge it immediately so I told her to just bring it to the room and plug it into my other charger (I have 2, 1 for my phone and 1 for my tablet and bluetooth earbuds). Her room is like 10 steps away from mine. It's not that hard, she's not ill or anything but she keeps doing it so as a last resort, I've changed the pattern to stop her from using it without my permission and she was visibly upset when she realized I did change it.

I am firm with my decision because I'm tired of having her overheat my devices but I have this nagging feeling that I might be overreacting and I remember my brother's body language when I mentioned I was thinking of doing it was kind of like ""a little harsh but ok"". After all, it's a tablet. I can still charge it. It hasn't broke yet but still, her inability to take care of it irks me.

83,1d0a46k,AITA for competing against my school's graduation dinner?,"Basically the school planned for us (without asking or anything) the graduation dinner & night at school for a not so cheap price of 60 euros per person. These 60 euros are for a mediocre dinner AT SCHOOL, with catering & service. Nonetheless a good amount of my classmates and I, disagree with this, as

1. We never got a choice of how we want to spend our money; so even if the catering and all is worth the 60 bucks, we never asked for a middleman to plan it for us.
2. When we asked the vice principal about an alternative to the dinner, she said to go home.
3. There are plenty of restaurants with better vibe, food & atmosphere.

Because of this, I took it as my personal responsibillity as Headstudent to provide both me and classmates with a better, more worthy alternative, And messaged everyone in my class who i knew disagreed with the dinner individually & added them to a groupchat. I chose to do this in order to not stir drama in the main groupchat for our class as I know that there are a few select people who strongly disagree with me. Anywho, I now have this groupchat with 23/29 members of my class and we already started looking at restaurants and stuff. I also planned to use some money that we saved up throughout the year to pay for a bus to get us from school to the fancy restaurant we'd choose. My plan is that the day that the school sends an official email asking who is going to the dinner at school I'd send a poll in the whole class groupchat asking who is gonna go, this way, everyone who was in the gc I made would vote no, and the remaining 7 would go with us as well. Before that I also have a plan to use all this organising as leverage to negotiate a lowering in price with the school, getting the message across that if I they don't lower the price, no one will go, in a last attempt to not go directly against them.

I told all of this to my mom, and she strongly disagrees, as she thinks that I should be more grateful for the school and the teacher, and that I have no right to tell people where they should go. She told me i have a huge ego and asked me who I think I am for trying something like this, and that I am using people.

All I wanted to do is create a better alternative for my classmates and I, and bringing them together, albeit not at school, as some of them were gna go with their families in different places anyways.

84,1d09zz4,WIBTA if I keep Her Security Deposit?,"My roommate got transferred to another state (she applied for it without telling me) and unfortunately we signed a lease to a new place already. She’s leaving at the end of June and we were supposed to move in our new place at first week of June.

So me basically having no time to look for a new roommate I just decided to get a 1 bedroom in the same apartment complex, which was more expensive. They were very gracious in letting me be able to transfer my lease information and deposit over to a new unit.

Also instead of having to pay 2 months rent plus security deposit for leaving she only had to forfeit her security deposit, any other money she gave them and she relinquished all her rights and responsibilities to the apartment. She signed a roommate removal form agreeing to all of this. 

Now she wants me to give her back the $500 out of the 1k deposit we gave to the apartment complex. I’ve asked a couple of people and some said legally I don’t have to give it to her, especially since she put me in a tough spot waiting last minute to tell me.

Others have said they’d give it to her to avoid drama.

I want to keep it especially since she knew it’d be almost impossible for me to find someone willing to to split the already insane rent we were paying, plus I barely had time to vet anyone.

What do you guys think?

85,1d09utc,AITA for preferring my wife's family?,"Me M33 and wife 30 have been together for 11 years and have a 3yo son.  

My family is what they themselves call 'traditional'. That means I was spanked as a kid, dad drinks too much and mom is overbearing. My oldest sister was parentified and is very resentful towards the whole family and my brother is an alcoholic. I cannot have an honest conversation with my parents without mom overstepping or dad berating me. My mom hates my wife and my sister's husband just for existing. You get the picture. They're not bad people or anything and I do love them but we're not the happy family my mom pretends to be on facebook.  

My wife's family, on the other hand, is just... nice? She's best friends with her siblings and they're all very close. Over the years, I've become good friends with her sisters' husbands too. When we first started dating I was like wow, your parents are really good at controlling themselves and not quarrelling in front of us during dinner. She was like '???' It took me some time to really fathom that this is just how they are and that family relationships like this are possible. Anyways, from the very start they treated me like a member of the family and I feel very comfortable and enjoy spending time with them.  

I used to feel guilty for spending more time with my wife's family than mine. It changed when our kid got seriously sick and nearly died. My wife's family stepped up and did all in their power to help us without overstepping. Meanwhile, my mom acted like the main character, constantly calling my wife for updates and crying, expecting us to console her while my dad shut out and drank. I understand everyone reacts to stress differently, but this situation really made me realise what example I want to set for my kid.  

So I no longer try to ensure 'equal time' for my parents during holidays. We go to in laws because the atmosphere there is good. I make sure to call my parents and visit them but I no longer drag my wife and kid along as neither of them enjoys it and it's not the right example for my son.  

Now, my birthday is coming up and we have a trip planned. My MIL will be flying with us and babysitting. I'm really grateful because I was not comfortable leaving our son behind but we also wouldn't have been able to attend certain events there if not for MIL's help.  

My parents wanted to come visit on my birthday and I had to tell them all about the trip because mom kept asking.   

This resulted in mom disowning me for taking MIL on a trip when it should be her I'm treating. However, she's not going there to be treated she's going there to help. Also, my mom is morbidly obese among other things and I wouldn't trust her with a toddler so I can't take her instead.

86,1d09he7,AITA for excluding and ignoring a friend during a difficult time?,"Throwaway + English isn’t my native language, so sorry for any mistakes! 

I’m (25F) currently on a Masters scholarship abroad with others from my country. Four of us live in the same building albeit on separate floors, so we see each other near daily / quite often. 

However I am closest to my friend, S (27F). We have grown incredibly close and I spend most of my time over at her flat, go out together, shop together etc. Basically we are glued to each other. R (29F), the other friend, is less present. A few things happened between us at the beginning of our studies here, including her bad mouthing me to another friend and then backpedaling and basically blaming me for her actions when I confronted her and the group. Needless to say I’m not very close to her and generally avoid messaging or talking to her unless something is up or there’s mutual friends coming over to see us. 

S recently lost her young brother. While I won’t get into the circumstances, it’s been incredibly heartbreaking and difficult since she’s abroad and due to current circumstances in our country, she’s unable to visit home.  Me and R have been spending time with her most of the days to keep her company and also just help around with anything she needs. But in the recent few days R has stopped coming by, or only comes by at nighttime when S is tired or I’m about to head back to my place. She repeatedly would say she’ll come at this time only to bail out at the last minute, and has continued to go to parties, hang out with her friends and generally returned to her normal routine while A is still grieving for her brother. Short version: I find her actions tacky and did voice that to my friends, especially because she keeps lying about where she’s going when we ask generally. 

I personally never invite her along. Two days ago a mutual friend came over for the night. We ended up staying the entire day together, went to grab some stuff for a few occasions, and generally S was in a better mood. But R repeatedly texted us and S if we were home because she wants to see us– I guess she saw that we had a guest over at reception (we live in a private student accommodation, so you have to sign in guests). At the same time she had a friend I really hate at her place, which meant she’d bring said person along. I didn’t reply, neither did S. This morning she sent a lengthy text in the lines of “why do I feel like I’m being forgotten” and “do you remember me? I live with you. I’m R.” In a very condescending tone. It’s not the first time she’s done this (she’s very fond of going out with friends and never telling us to join, but if we do that and she finds out she gets incredibly upset and will send massive rants) but in the current situation it truly felt… cheap.

My father is divorcing his now wife, and she is currently working in a place, where I work.

I told her that he had done things like that in the past and that was one of the reasons they got divorced.

1 hour ago he calls me that he wants to meet and give me some clothes, we meet, and he just starts yelling ""what the fuck have you told her, we are divorcing right now because of you, all your generation does not know how to hold your tongue shut, you should have said you didnt know anything, etc etc. he also said, that she doesn't matter as much to him, and he wants me to know this lesson to know my mouth shut.""

88,1d09en2,AITA for stealing a $3000 bottle of champagne?,"Every Christmas we have a huge family lunch. Kris Kringle happens after Lunch when everyone is intoxicated. You’re supposed to wrap a $50 gift, put it on a pile and someone random picks one they want to open, then the person next to them ect. House rules are any person after the first is allowed to trade/steal off someone who has already opened theirs.

Since we have such a wealth gap some ppl go way over budget. It turns Kris Kringle into a horrible game of “I’m going to steal whatever I think is worth the most.” Every year my Uncles FIL brings a bottle of champagne worth up to $3000. I’ve watched it end up back in his hands each time, or someone wealthier. Watching my relatives, who would never be able to drink something like that so exited to get it, or anything else that they would consider a luxury, only for the person who bought it to steal it just because they can feels cruel and unusual.

I turned 18 last year, so I’m included in Kris Kringle. It went like usual with the grossly inappropriate behaviour and stealing. I can drink/not planning to, but I went to steal the bottle of champagne. My Aunts mother told me no, “you can’t take this if you’re not going to drink it.” I said I was going to give it to my parents, because I was and there shouldn’t have been a problem with that. There’s no rules about using/sharing the gift you pick, but she was adamant what I was doing *was not allowed* and that I was purposely stirring up trouble. It blew up because I asked for a proper reason why I wasn’t allowed to. My grandparents tried to get them to let it go, but they ended up fighting. My uncle called me ungrateful and my mum went off on him saying he was just as ungrateful towards the $50 presents, that he treats us different because we’re struggling to pay our bills ect. In the end he, my aunt and her parents walked out, and took the bottle with them. It ruined the rest of the afternoon and they flew back early. 

My parents didn’t blame me at the time and let me know they understood why I did it, but that i should have just given up the bottle. I apologised to them because I had no idea it was going to be taken so seriously. I never would have taken it if I knew. 

Now it’s may and they’re still not talking. My parents say it’s because of Christmas and want me to apologise. My mums other brother says he’s on my side and this kind of thing has happened before, that they’ve always been like this. My mum agrees but just wants to smooth things over.

I don’t want to apologise. I don’t even think it’s really about the champagne. I think my relatives are blowing what happened completely out of proportion because I inadvertently pointed out their bs behaviour and they don’t like that.

89,1d097hy,WIBTA for refusing to go to my nephews bday party?,"Hello Reddit. I (F30) have a brother and SIL roughly the same age as me. They have two children (M8 / M10).

We were all at a family gathering when my SIL's mother idly commented 'I'm looking forward to seeing you at Nephews birthday party tomorrow'. Now this shocked me because despite knowing he had an upcoming birthday, I'd heard nothing about any party and assumed there wouldn't be one this year, or that it was going to be late next week and invitations had yet to be sent. Clearly, this was not the case, and I told her that I know nothing about any birthday party. She looked a bit awkward and apologised before changing the subject.

Well, I was quite upset at the revelation that there was apparently a birthday party planned with family but I hadn't been invited, and I left quite shortly after that interaction. It's important to mention that while there has been some family tension since I split with my partner as my brother was extremely close friends with him and often took his side, there have been many birthdays for kids and adults since, and I've been invited/attended them.

After the family catch up, I received a text from my brother inviting me to my nephews birthday. There was nothing really to the text, just a 'oh hey, Nephew's birthday tomorrow if you're free'.

My knee jerk reaction was no. I am free, and I love my nephew, but I believe I was either out right forgotten, or that I just wasn't invited. And now, because the cat is outta the bag, he's inviting me to save face and so he can't be called the asshole for not inviting me. I don't know that I want to walk around a birthday party hosted by two people who, in all likelihood, didn't want or care to have me there in the first place. Plus, because I knew nothing, I don't even have a present for my Nephew. But I'm worried about the potential long term fallout or hurting my nephews feelings.

His mother (56F) and I usually get along great until something that happened last night. We had just finished shopping for some new clothes. I set them down on a table in our room that's opposite to the door of our bathroom. 

After I finished showering, I stepped outside and saw her handling our clothes with a pair of scissors. To be honest, I was pretty shocked by this. I sort of went ""Hey! What are you doing??"" and she turned around and screamed. She started accusing me of threatening her life, since something like this could have given her a heart attack.

91,1d090rt,AITA For using the dryer when my housemates 3 year old is sleeping?,"Am I the asshole for using the dryer after my housemates child has gone to sleep? 

I live with coupled housemates and their almost 3yo. 
I work 5 days a week doing 9 hour shifts between 6:30-6:30 and one of my housemates also works 5 days, the other is a stay at home mum but will work 2 half days throughout the week. 

Often I will try get all my washing done on a Saturday morning, but frequently my house mates choose to do washing on a Saturday too. Meaning my washing gets pushed to the afternoon/evening resulting in my washing needing to be in the dryer during the same time the child goes down to sleep at 6:30. I feel they need to use the 3-5 other days a week depending on her work schedule to get their washing done. 

They regularly ask me not to use the dryer after their child is going to sleep or once she is asleep. 
But when I work full time and get home at 6:30 that means I am not allowed to do any washing after I get home throughout the work week. 

I completely understand I need to be respectful of their child and not making excess noises when she is sleeping, I can assure I am by no means a noisy housemate as I spend the little spare time I have in my bedroom sleeping. I also make sure to wait until the child is asleep before I turn the dryer on just incase it disrupts her falling asleep. Every time I have had the dryer running while she is sleeping she has never woken up, but they still don’t want it on. 

I just simply can’t understand why the dryer is a problem at all. She sleeps in her own bedroom with constant white noise playing, with the bedroom door shut and typically will not wake up until it’s morning - the child is a good sleeper. The dryer is in the laundry behind a closed door. With the door shut it isn’t disruptive. 

When I work an earlier shift in the week it’s not a problem as I can do washing then, and in summer this isn’t really a problem as I can hang all my clothes up to dry, but at the moment in winter everything takes so long to air dry it starts to get that wet dog smell while it’s drying, meaning I need to use the dryer. 

I don’t think that the dryer is a disturbance as the child has never woken up when the dryer has been running. Am I the asshole for using the dryer after she has fallen asleep, am I being unreasonable?

I was also a little stressed about immediate schedule changes at work and was planning to request the boss for working remotely.

It was just the boss, friend and me around that late evening. They both were talking about logistics for returning her badge, equipment etc I did not interfere, was just sitting there. After they were all done and were not talking anything much, I brought up my remote working topic with the boss. My friend also started talking actively. They were getting very distracted and moving to other topics and twice i had to bring the topic back to my request. She was actually making suggestions to the boss about my request. I told her those won't work for me. I even told in a very low voice to my friend that i wanted to take care of it. 

I later told my friend that i wanted to deal with it myself, her involving was only making the discussion get distracted. She got mad and started crying. She said she knows better about the boss and was trying to help. If i wanted to deal with it myself i should have gone to a conf room and not when she is around.

I believe her intentions, she always wants to help but she did not understand how much important my request was to me and how stressed i was about it when the talk with boss was getting distracted. My approval is still pending and i was upset but i had to spend the rest of evening consoling her.

My understanding is, when two people are discussing something important others stay out of it.

96,1d086pp,AITA for finally saying something about my husband consuming everything in the house especially items I get for myself,"So context. I grew up really poor. I didn’t get to buy snacks for me, or drinks I like. So as an adult, I get things that I enjoy but I don’t run through it within a day. Example, I drink like one diet soda a day. I buy plenty of groceries and separate snacks for my husband. I’ll actually buy him more than I get myself. I’m not a snacker often. I’ll get one or two things for me, and plenty for him. I’ll also get plenty of meals to make, and some easy quick pop in the microwave meals just in case I’m not home to cook dinner.
 
Everytime I buy something he’ll eat everything so fast. Like I’ll go to make dinner, it’ll be missing ingredients for said dinner. His snacks will be gone, and he’ll start eating mine. He claims he doesn’t like soda, he then drinks all of mine because he said “it’s there.” 
 
At first I really didn’t want to say anything about it. But it’s frustrating because I budget, I don’t plan to have all these extra expenses of having to refill the fridge after three days when it’s a week or more worth of groceries. 
  
I finally say something in response to this, because he polished off a whole bag of my favorite snack and drank like 6 16 oz diet sodas in one sitting. He gets so tore up at me. He tells me I’m selfish, he won’t touch my stuff ever again. Tells me I’m basically his dad and wouldn’t unpack that subject. Tells me I act as if we can’t buy more. This fight literally turned into a huge ordeal in which I just tried to explain, I’d buy him his own of the same thing if he really likes those items. 
  
He refused that option saying that he knows what I’m thinking even though I’m not saying it. When I asked to explain he ran off to our bedroom and went to bed. I tried to talk to him, and tell him in no way was I being hostile which ended with him screaming and telling me to shut up.

100,1d07zz3,WIBTA If I moved out and kept our stuff without informing my soon to be ex-boyfriend?,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. Also sorry for my English, it's not my native.

In the earliest parts of our relationship, I let my him stay with us at home (with my mom and brother). He didn't pay rent or help with the bills except for his own food sometimes, slept peacefully in my room with AC, played games with our fast as fuck internet, free Spotify and Netflix, and didn't even help with housework. This went on for 8 months until I kicked him out and had a shouting fight for being horribly disrespectful to me due to his bad temper.

We broke up for a month but later decided to try again. He promised to change, and so we moved in together. He promised to help with housework, and it's not his first time moving out since he lived alone in an apartment before. 

When we moved in, every decision about the apartment suddenly came down to me. From what's for dinner, which appliance to purchase next, to groceries, cooking, decorating, throwing the garbage, and cleaning the bathroom, all of these became my responsibilities, which left me miserable and exhausted.

I had to beg him to wipe the spills off the counter after making coffee, to wash the shorts he soaked for a fucking month that have dried and turned brown, to wash my cup as well, to stop being condescending, and to literally stop shouting at the cashier at the pretzel shop for making a simple mistake.

I'm done with this spoiled imbecile who can't even do the bare minimum. I have become a single mother to a 32-year-old manchild at 29, teaching basic things that he should have known two decades ago.

We shared expenses for most furniture, but then again, those decisions came from my mental load. I'm the one who put their mind to it, all he did was give me half the cash. After everything I did to improve our quality of life, he has the audacity to ""kick me out of the apartment"" and tell me I'm the one using him for my own benefit, how I was the narcissist in this relationship when we had an argument due to his bad temper again.

I want to find a better job and move out to a new place alone with my cat and just move on, but this would take months or a year of preparation for me (everything is too expensive and I'm not earning enough). Considering the fact that I'm the only one carrying the mental load of running the house, I feel like I should keep most of our stuff and just move on. Letting him keep them would just make me feel more used.

I think he'll reach out and somehow make a scene as to how he should have a say, but it's impossible to have a proper adult conversation with him. I'm thinking of getting a loan to give him a half estimate of his shares as a pacifier, but I don't know if it's worth it. So now my final solution is to leave quietly while he's at work and take all the stuff with me. WIBTA here if I did this?

My mom knows my situation and she keeps calling me. i have no issues with her calling me but every phone call i received is always an unpleasant phone call. its either she complains about her work, or reminding me of my past mistakes.

103,1d07uw7,WIBTA for nor going to a conference with my friends?,"
I (19F) am in a group of 4 friends (all girls) and we are all in the same class. We have been friends for 5 years now and we had our ups and downs. 

Last Monday a guy in our class told us that he and some other people organised a conference in another town (1/2h away ) and he shared a form that we had to send with our informations IF we wanted to join the conference. 

Since Wednesday I kept asking my friends if they wanted to go to this conference, which would imply that we would miss school. Friends kept telling me that they didn't want to go because it was a long drive and we couldn't be bother to drive there, spend an hour looking for a parking spot (busy city in busy working days yk) and they couldn't be bother to spend 3 hours listening to a boring conference.

I agreed with them but just to make sure, I kept asking every day if they changed their mind, and last time I asked was via text on Friday at 4 pm, to which they respond that they didn't want to go. We had time to sign the form until Friday at midnight, but they said that they DIDN'T want to go so I thought it was a closed conversation. 

Friday night I decide to go to sleep early (10.40 pm) and I didn't check the phone until the morning after at 9.30am. BUT I received a text at 11pm from one of my friends informing me that they all ended up signing the form and she asked me if I wanted to sign it too. I was a sleep so I didn't see the text until the morning so I was too late to sign the form formally.
Yes I could text the guy from our class and I'm sure he can find me a place but I don't want to because I feel left out.

It's not the first time they decide to do something without me and informe at the very last. And yes I could get a place but in a world where we don't know the guy who organised this thing, I would be left out because I went to SLEEP and I didn't stay awake and alert waiting for them to decide last minute. 
In the end I wrote to the girl that texted me during the night and told her that I won't go to the conference and I don't think I'll want to go out today with them IF they invite me.

I feel left out, maybe they didn't do it on purpose but still I feel like I can't get a minute of peace and I need to be always ready if I want to do stuff with them and be included. It doesn't really matter to me but the day during which the conference take place would also he my birthday so now I know that I'll spend it home alone just because I went to sleep and didn't see their text. It doesn't seem fair and it's not the first time they do this kind of things. But an outsider could take their side because they informed me that they changed their minds and it's my fault if I didn't see the text.

So would I be the asshole if I get mad at them and not go to the conference?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-25,"WIBTA for nor going to a conference with my friends?

104,1d07tb0,AITA for telling my nephew's mom and her family that they have double standards I don't agree with?,"So my brother has an 8 month old son with his ex, who was also my best friend for 20 years. My friendship with her went downhill after she and my brother started dating. They didn't seem good together. She asked and I told her as much and she didn't like that. So she wasn't really talking to me. Then they had a surprise pregnancy and broke up almost immediately after that. Apparently my brother's reaction wasn't what she wanted because she thought the pregnancy was a bad thing initially and he was excited. She was so sour about it when they told us she was pregnant. It was no surprise when they broke up. She tried to befriend me after the breakup again and told me how much she missed me and how right I was. Her family, who I was close to for many years before, weren't as thrilled by her reaching back out to me because they felt like I cursed the relationship between my brother and her.

During the pregnancy she started dating someone else and moved in with him. My brother went on some dates with his now-girlfriend and was called out by the ex and her family for dating while he should be focusing on being a dad. They said he was disrespectful to her dating while she was carrying his child. That double standard astounded me because she was the one who broke up with him and she was also dating and LIVING with someone else already.

My nephew was born and they complained about my brother's involvement and how he wouldn't just leave her with baby for as long as she liked. A DNA test was carried out because they weren't married, custody was set up and now they split time with the baby. My brother and his girlfriend are still dating. My nephew's mom broke up with the other guy.

Since the breakup my nephew's mom and her family have been trying to get me back into the fold with them and I have kept my distance, but politely. They recently asked me about this though and why I was so cold with them and I told them they have a double standard I don't agree with. I told them they treated my brother like trash and acted like he was a monster for dating while she was pregnant but she was allowed to live with another man and be with him, even having him at the birth of my nephew, but they were still angry my brother had a girlfriend who he didn't live with or even have around my nephew yet. I told them I wasn't okay with that and couldn't get on board.

They told me I should see how it's different and accused me of being a sexist asshole.

105,1d07ov9,AITA for ignoring my bf bc he came home around 6AM 'from a bar somewhere with 2 guys you wouldn't know'?,"When i asked him which bar, he mumbled angrily 'please stop talking'. So well there you go im ignoring  you

The thing that upsets me also is that we were actually going to have some drinks together at home after he got off work. And i waited for him feeling sorry that he had to come home so late (he's a manager in a bar himself). 

We stopped going out together a long time ago, bc he doesnt like drinking anymore and also because he doesn't feel comfortable with me drinking in a club/bar whatever. I dont mind that much as i am shy anyways and wont be having a good time if hes feeling uncomfortable. But him just going out with people i dont know, at the same time blowing me off without notice or an apology, just hits me where it hurts. 

(Perspective: id been having a very hard time the last few months - also why i am so active on reddit now lmao - and hes been amazingly patient, helpful and sweet. So i really dont know if 'its valid' for me to be this angry about 1 night out. But... why not just tell me, even just a Quick call or text saying, 'sorry babe i need a night out w friends i am at X location dont wait up' or something? This no explanation thing just makes me paranoid besides that he was with women that he doesnt want to talk about. I know his friends and they're all exactly the type to encourage cheating, the type that has wife and Kids at home but thinks its completely justified to drink & party the whole weekend.)",Not the A-hole,2024-05-25,"AITA for ignoring my bf bc he came home around 6AM 'from a bar somewhere with 2 guys you wouldn't know'?

106,1d07h0u,WIBTA if I take my two bio kids for a beach weekend when my stepkids are with their mom?,"I (32f) have two stepchildren who are 14m and 13f and two bio children who are 4m and 2m. I don't have a very good relationship with my stepkids right now and they don't have a good relationship with their half siblings. This makes having family time together a very rough experience. It's also impossible for us all to have a good time if I take all four kids anywhere alone. It's a mess. So when my sister asked me if I'd like to have a beach weekend when my husband is out of town for work next month, I said sure. Her husband owns a beach house and she was planning to go with her kids and our mutual best friend and her kids.

My MIL did not like the plan because my stepkids will be with their mom and she feels something like this should wait until I have the kids despite the fact nobody would have fun doing this. My husband TJ supports me going and told his parents as much. I admit I'm conflicted.

For those who need BG: I met TJ 12 years ago. My stepkids were both under 3 years old. Their mother was engaged to someone at the time too; We got along fine. TJ and I got married after 2 years together. Not long after things changed with the kids' mother. Her engagement broke down sometime before TJ and I married. A while after my marriage she became very toxic and angry. She hated me most of all and accused me of trying to replace her with the kids and make her look like a bad mom. None of this is true.

This started years of alienation and an unsettled parenting time split with the courts sometimes taking custody from her, giving her every other weekend or 50/50. Currently it's 50/50. The kids are in therapy, we have all been ordered into mediation, co-parenting classes, family therapy as a group of five and therapy between TJ and the mom. She has been arrested three times which has influenced the courts rulings on custody at times. The kids believe her that I'm trying to replace her. They believe I tried to make her look bad. They hate me. When they interact with me they tell me I am not their mom and they won't do chores when only I'm home or they won't go to the store with me. My husband ended up hiring someone to help when he works. They behave way better with him except where our bio kids together are concerned. They have been punished at times for their behavior. It's not ideal. It doesn't work. They're still in therapy. I don't need them to love me. But to not get angry and lash out from my presence would be ideal. To not be cruel to their half siblings.

It's so tough finding the right balance between supporting and loving them and being here and not overstepping or inserting myself where they don't want me and making things worse. What's hardest is my husband's family believe I am better for the kids than their mom is and they encourage me to build up a mom relationship with them and they judge me for not trying to give the kids that.

107,1d07glz,AITA For Telling My Mom 2 Out of Her 3 Kids Think She’s a Horrible Person  ,"I basically told my mom that she’s a horrible mother and that she’s only married to my dad for appearances. She used to post photos of herself on Instagram saying she  “might not be a good person but she loves her kids” so I told her that 2 out of 3 of her kids hate her. I told her that she has a loyal husband who loves her but she continues to pick other man over all of us - even though he has no desire to marry her or be with her. I was very harsh and very mean - mostly just tired of her crap tbh. 

Backstory

I’m the oldest of 3 and growing up, my mother would tell me that I ruined my life and wished I was never born - because of my existence, she had to stay with my dad, who she hates. I love my dad and I hate when she’s mean to him or belittles him. She blames me and my dad for her life not turning out the way she wanted. Dad came from wealthy family but left it behind when they both ran away together. 

My mom cheated on my dad when I was around 10 or 11. They had an ongoing relationship and my parents used to have horrible yelling fights. At one point, she left us for a couple of days. Another time when I was around 12, she had gotten into a really bad car accident with that man - she had to be hospitalized. Other man ended up in jail because he was on probation at the time. My mom even brought me to jail for a visit with him, which looking back at it seems so wild. 

As an adult now, I’m trying to repair the relationship with my family. I’ve been married for 7 years, my husband is my best friend.

Her and my Dad’s birthdays are a few days apart not long after Mother’s Day. I had initially asked to take her out for brunch on Mother’s Day and then do a joint lunch/dinner for their birthdays. Mother’s Day came and she was being really dodgy about choosing a place to eat. The day before she tells me she’s just going to stay home. I was hurt. My sister later texted me that my mom doesn’t want me to always spend money (I always pay for meals/lunch/dinner).

For their joint bday, I had suggested a day in between their birthdays, my dad’s bday is on the 24th, hers is on the 27th. She said she couldn’t celebrate her birthday early due to cultural traditions so we waited for the next weekend. On my dad’s birthday, I also had to take him to a doctor’s appointment. My mom asked if she could come to the doctor’s appointment and if I could drop them off at Disneyland. In my gut, I felt a little weird about this situation but luckily she said my dad didn’t want to go. I texted her asking if she wanted to grab a cake with me afterward so we could have a little surprise for my dad after the doctor’s appointment. She said yes. However, when I picked them up, she was wearing her Disney shirt and said they wanted a ride. 

Life has always been like this with her. There’s never any communication or planning - it’s always chaotic.

And reinforced it wasn’t a joke cause later on in other meets if I ever did anything wrong, embarrassing or even if I just was acting silly she said to my wife “there’s still time..” or “you can always leave” which I never confronted at the time cause when there was drama between my mom and M&M regarding a Facebook post ( M&M got offended about a post that my mom was tagged in) she chose to keep her kids (she has 3 total 2 at the time)away from my parents for I think a year. I lived with my parents still and if I confronted her I felt that she would take the kids from my parents again. So for the time being I bit my tongue.
Time goes by still dealing with the same comments and and overall ridicule M&m continues to throw. While getting more confident that she starts pointing out flaws I have when my wife is away. I was still insecure at the time and she knew that. So anyways my wife and I get engaged she amazing, beautiful, kind, and very family oriented. When we tell my brother and M&M my brother is happy for us and congratulates us while M&M says “nice” and doesn’t congratulate us. For our engagement party my mom asked M&M to make cookies for us (which she did to make extra money) and she said ok we even pay her $150 dollars cause they’re decorative and day of she comes down with the “stomach flu” along with her kids and can’t give us the cookies in case she or the kids contaminated them. We never got the refund back nor has she acknowledged it to this day and her kids were fine the next day.

That’s brings us to now my wife whom is getting ignored by M&M and even skipped my wife when she was having everyone hold her 3rd baby and when M&M heard that I was getting a house she had no reaction.

111,1d078e6,AITA Are my parents toxic or am I not doing enough?,"Hello! I need an outside opinion because I always feel drained around my parents. Lately, I've stopped reaching out to them and feel much better not being around them.

I'm in college and just finished my finals with mostly A's and two B's. Finals ended a week ago, and I'm currently jobless. My mom used to call me frequently, asking about college and finals. Once finals were over, she started asking about my job hunt.

Earlier in the semester, my parents insisted I must have a job before the semester ended. They even drove six hours to help me drop off my resume at ten restaurants, but none have contacted me since. I already felt drained after a few hours with them. They are paying for my college, rent, and car, but I will pay them back for the rent over the summer, which I appreciate.

Weeks went by, and I kept checking in with three high-end restaurants where I really want to work, but no luck so far. Recently, my mom asked how summer was going and brought up job hunting. I've been talking to friends about job opportunities, but the best advice I've received is that I might get hired at the end of summer. I've also applied to two other places online and am waiting to hear back.

My parents keep telling me to visit every shop downtown and hand out my resume everywhere. When I spoke with my mom, it turned into an argument. She questioned why I didn't have a job yet and implied I wasn't trying hard enough. I explained that finals had just finished and I was still searching, but she didn't believe me. I had to end the call to take a break.

I sent a long text to my mom explaining that I needed a break from the phone calls and arguments about finding a job. My parents then called me back, yelling that I was using my anxiety as an excuse and that I was spoiled because they were paying for my expenses. This reminded me of last summer when they yelled at me for not finding a full-time job even though I had a part-time one.

After their lecture, they told me that if I didn't have a job within a week, they would take my car. Since they live six hours away, my car is my only way of getting around and visiting them. It's only been a week since finals, and my parents are angry that I didn't find a job during the entire semester. I now dread their calls and texts and don't even want to visit them. I haven't seen them in two months, and I still don't want to.

I also asked my brother for advice since he is successful in his career. It turns out my parents told him everything, and he talked to me about it too, but he was much cooler about it. I've been telling my friends about this issue, and some of them are going through the same thing. Some say my parents are toxic, but I don't want to believe them. They also say the job market in my town stinks. I've cried multiple times after arguing with my parents. Am I wrong? Should I have done better? Even if I'm right, how should I address this issue?

112,1d076lq,AITA for wanting my partner to apologize for taking her seat belt off?,"I was driving my car today with my fiancee in the passenger seat. I’m Australian, and in my country it is the law to wear a seatbelt at all times. As we were driving along a busy highway, in a section heavily-populated with government-owned cameras aimed through car windscreens (and large electronic signs saying “It is an offence to not wear a seatbelt, fines and demerit points apply”), she realised that she was uncomfortably hot, and undid her seatbelt for 20 seconds or so as she removed her sweater.

I was a little annoyed at this - especially as she’d just broken the law AND done it in an area where the chances of being caught for it are high (and it is the driver who is penalised for passengers not wearing seatbelts - not the passenger). I asked her to please not do it again, as I was quite annoyed that she had just put me at risk of getting fined. She couldn’t see what the problem was - and when I asked her to apologise she refused to.

Her argument is that she only had the seatbelt undone for 20 seconds, and she should only have to apologise if I end up getting a fine.

113,1d070br,AITA for not having a low volume on the TV after midnight?,"I, 17M have had a rocky relationship with my sister (Kate, 25F) for as long as I remember. There were instances where I would’ve been less than double digits in age where I would’ve done something wrong in either my actions or what I have said and whenever she gets the chance, she always brings it up to spite me or so she can humiliate me in front of others.

Last week, my mother was called into school because of an incident in which I verbally retaliated to some people harassing me in school. On our way home, we went to get some groceries. She bought me some snacks because while I’ve been looked after by my sisters (my parents live in Dubai for work, my Mum just happened to be home for a visit), they’ve not allowed me to get some of the drinks or foods I would normally get if my parents were still in the country. When we arrived home, Kate said my mother was an ‘awful parent’ for indulging in my ‘junk food cravings’ even though in actual fact, I’m quite underweight and don’t really have that much sweets, soft drinks etc. She then went on to say she thinks our mother is so horrible that she probably told me ‘nothing’ was my fault in the incident which happened at school. When I told her I actually took responsibility for my part in it and our Mum had yelled at me before and after we went to get groceries, she said to me ‘That’s a likely story’ and left the room.

Yesterday, I stayed up until midnight to watch Doctor Who. It used to air earlier but since it got some big investment from Disney, they’ve been airing it later to suit American people’s timing better. My volume was on 7. It was quite low that even I could barely hear it and had to put subtitles on. In the next room was my Nan and she was asleep. Upstairs, was Kate in one room and then my brother, sister in-law and baby nephew in another. Then on the top floor was my other sister and her boyfriend. 

Kate texted me right at the end of my show saying ‘Keep the noise down, tryna sleep’. I replied to it saying ‘Sorry if you find it loud but it was below 10 and it was so low I had subtitles on and you know I never have subtitles on so I really don’t see the issue when everyone else is asleep’. She then went on this whole rant about how inconsiderate I was. I suggested she might have selective hearing and given our inability to be amicable to each other, maybe she was just looking for another excuse to argue and to this she responded ‘Keep victimising yourself’. I said to her that it isn’t my fault she was still awake, probably FaceTiming her boyfriend (which I have seen her do this late in the night before). I said to her if other people complained then I’d understand but there were two people in the house closer to the tv room that were fast asleep and when I brought it up this morning, told me they couldn’t hear a thing.

114,1d06umt,AITA for not allowing my siblings to visit my home until they can be respectful of our differences?,"My siblings and I lost our mom, or as they call her, their biological mom, when we were young. I (24m) was 6 when mom died and they were 3f and 2m. Two years later our dad met his second wife as I see her while they see her as their mom. This was not something I always understood. For a few years I always thought they would see mom as their one and only mom like me and I really had a hard time with them calling dad's wife mom. My dad did an awful job of trying to help me with that. He tried to insist she was our new mother and that really made it worse and my dad's wife handled it even worse by spewing a lot of religious stuff at me about mom asking Jesus to send us a new and better mom. I don't think she was trying to be malicious but not the way to speak to a kid who loves and remembers his mom.

It was my grandparents (maternal) who helped me eventually, where even therapy couldn't. They told me that the kids were so young when mom died that for them a piece was missing and dad's wife filled that for them and they felt loved and comforted around her which was the most important thing and we should want that for them if it's what they need/crave. They admitted to hating it as well and wishing it was different but also said they loved my siblings more than they hated the situation. It really helped me. Also getting to talk about how different it was for me because I had my own memories of mom while they only had other people's memories of her. So I came to accept that we were so different now. They had a different mom to me. But I still loved and wanted the best for them so I learned to be okay with that.

This is not true for my siblings who don't understand why I can't see their mom as my mom. They don't bring it up all the time. But they always do when they visit my home. I always had a photo of mom and us somewhere no matter where I lived but now I live with my girlfriend and we're in our own home and I have more traces of mom around. They always bring up how I have mom in my home but not their mom. How I should have ""real"" family photos and not old ones. They come to see me more now that I live here and it comes up way more. 

So I sat my siblings down and told them we're different. That's something I accepted a long time ago. That yes I used to have issues with them accepting dad's wife as mom. I was a kid. I learned to do better. But it didn't change how I feel or perceive dad's wife and they should work on accepting the same, because it's driving us apart. They told me the difference is I cherish a memory while they cherish the living person who took care of us. I told them we would never be on the same page and that's okay. But they should learn to be respectful of those differences and until that point they can't come over anymore because they won't stop trying to pick a fight about it.

They got mad and accused me of overreacting.

They always bring up how I have mom in my home but not their mom. How I should have ""real"" family photos and not old ones. They come to see me more now that I live here and it comes up way more. 

So I sat my siblings down and told them we're different. That's something I accepted a long time ago. That yes I used to have issues with them accepting dad's wife as mom. I was a kid. I learned to do better. But it didn't change how I feel or perceive dad's wife and they should work on accepting the same, because it's driving us apart. They told me the difference is I cherish a memory while they cherish the living person who took care of us. I told them we would never be on the same page and that's okay. But they should learn to be respectful of those differences and until that point they can't come over anymore because they won't stop trying to pick a fight about it.

They got mad and accused me of overreacting.

115,1d06okh,AITA for getting my son's ears pierced (and for not getting another son's ears pierced)?,"My family is complicated. I (34M) have 3 bio sons from 2 different women. Geo (10M) is my oldest from my ex, Quinn (38F). She and I share custody 50/50. Jay (8M) and Rob (7M) are my two youngest from my ex-wife. I have full custody. I live with my fiancée, Sam (32F), and her three boys (from her ex-husband): Gage (14M), Gannon (10M), and Gabe (3M).

This is about Rob and Geo. Rob has always been more ""feminine"" than other boys. Since he was born, he has been mistaken for a girl constantly (he is a beautiful child; it is what it is). He mostly wears more feminine clothes, and his favorite activity is dance. Since we have so many boys in the house, Sam and I often get accused of pushing Rob to be feminine because we ""wanted a girl"", but this is who he is. Geo isn't as ""feminine"" as Rob, but he is a bit ""feminine"" himself.

Rob has been wanting to get his ears pierced since he was 5. Sam and I now decided that he was responsible enough to have it done, so last month I took him to a piercing shop and paid for it to be done professionally. He loves them! And he takes really good care of them. Gage promised that if Rob got teased, that he (Gage) would get his ears pierced too haha. But most of the kids at school only have nice things to say about his pierced ears. For some reason, though, Quinn (who I have always gotten along with before), has started to say some negative things?

She says that he's going to get teased at school - he has been way in the past, but it's been taken care of (moved to a better school). Quinn says that people are going to think that he's a girl or that he's gay... I've kind of ignored Quinn's comments, but she's become very insistent that I take away Rob's earrings and let the piercings close. I don't know why? Rob's not her son. She's known him since he was born, but she has never had any kind of parental relationship with him, ever.

We've been getting into fights recently about this. She told me that I'm selfish for doing this to my son (?) and an AH, and that little boys shouldn't have piercings (?). She told me that Rob's going to hate me for doing this to him when he's older - but he wanted it done. I'm afraid that Geo's picking up on this tension between Quinn and I, and I'm afraid it's going to harm our relationship or his relationship with his half brothers.

So, then... Geo asked for his ears pierced too. He has brought it up before, but never as consistently as Rob (maybe like 1-2 times a year for the past 3 years?). I told him that I was okay with it, but that he needed his mom's permission. She obviously got really mad (at me). She told me that I'm pushing this onto him (and Rob) and that there's no way she's going to approve of this. Ever. Now Geo is accusing me of loving Rob more because I got Rob's ears pierced but not Geo's... am I the AH?

120,1d04eti,AITA: sleeping on the couch instead of in the bed.,"Hello Guys,
 
This is my first AITA post so if it’s a little rough, I do apologize.

So recently, my boyfriend and I got into an argument. The argument was because I have been sleeping on the couch recently and he just doesn’t like it. 

There are several reasons I prefer to sleep on the couch and none of them are because I don’t want to share the same bed as him (which I explained to him).

My reason for sleeping on the couch are:

1.) Having to work at 5 am, which means I have to get up at 3 am. And out of respect for him and not wanting to wake him up, it’s easier to just sleep on the couch.

2.) We have 2 dogs, they both sleep in the bed( I know this might be a bad habit but I don’t know what to do about it) both dogs hog the bed and I am always the one who is being kicked and or having the blankets ripped off of me, so this results in me not getting good sleep. He never deals with this issue because the dogs like to sleep up against me.

3.) We also have two cats, who LOVE to cuddle and sleep with me, and they never get the chance to because my boyfriend wants them out of the room, and we sleep with the door closed. But I feel so bad for them and I feel like when I’m able to cuddle and sleep with them it’s makes them so happy. My cat actually gets excited and waits for me to lay on the couch with him. 

4.) We don’t have aligning off days sometimes, and so when I’m off the next day I like to lay in the living room and stay up pretty late, watching Tv, reading, playing games etc. 


I think I’m being considerate, towards him, my cats and myself by choosing to sleep on the couch. But he doesn’t seem to think so. He gets so angry at me and when I try to tell him why and explain 1 of the 4 reasons why I want to sleep on the couch, he says that I have to many excuses. And then continues to be pissed at me for the rest of the night. 

This might sound silly or dumb, but i just don’t know if I’m the one out of line here.

So AITAH????

Recently, she updated me about her romantic life and mentioned that she had lost feelings for him, they never got to date or anything, she didn’t even hit him up. That same day, over text, i asked her about which career and university she had chosen to which she replied that she didn’t feel like doing it now, and was confused. 

And I mentioned to her that maybe the “idea” of starting a romantic relationship with someone had “pushed her” to worry about what she’d do with her life. To which she replied that she hadn’t asked for my opinion, and that he didn’t had anything to do with the fact she wanted to study because she doesn’t rely on him to make decisions. I told her I didn’t mean what i said in a negative way, and that sometimes we think and worry about the future when we face a potential relationship. 

She then went on saying that i was exhausting, and that she doesn’t want me to psychologically analyse her, and that if she wanted to she’d ask her psychologist, not me. 

I said that she had misunderstood me, and that I wanted to explain what i meant. To which she said that I think im better than everyone else because i see them as study subjects, and because i study them I’m lowering them and putting myself above, and also that I didn’t know how to apologise.  

(In other occasion she told me she didn’t like to make other people to feel displaced in conversations, and she includes everyone in. And i mentioned to her that usually people who’s been left apart in the past tend to do such things)

Now, the thing is the way i approach the world is by making paths to understand people, is hard for me to feel empathy. So in order to understand others I need to analyse them and follow that path until i can finally understand the way they feel and the way they act. 

But the things she said to me (that I’m unapologetic, and that i have a superiority complex) really got me thinking. That’d be the reason why i haven’t been able to think about this incident clearly.

123,1d03zbw,AITA for not letting my friend near my service dog unsupervised?,"Before I begin I love my friend and they are a great person, they just make mistakes sometimes . Please go easy on them!

I have a mastiff pup who is training to be my service dog. Recently I’ve had some issues with my friend over his care. 
Due to the nature of my disabilities they offered to help with his care when I am struggling and I agreed however they have overstepped boundaries multiple times.

Strike one: 
They offered to toilet him for me one morning when I was half asleep and I agreed. They took him into the kitchen and let their reactive dog near him. The dog is very sweet with people he knows but highly reactive with other dogs and resource guards people and food. My pup was 10  weeks old and to add neither dogs were vaccinated. Since then I caught the dog growling outside my pup’s crate with hackles and tail up. There was a door from the room I was in that lead outside so they had no reason to take him in the kitchen. They said they forgot that door was there yet they’ve lived in that house over 10 years.

Strike two:
They love grooming dogs and have proper tools and skills to do so. They offered to bAwth my pup so I said yes. They left him outside soakng wet which I discovered when I went out for a smoke. He was very cold and took me using blankets and a dryer to get him warm again.

Strike three: 
We both feed raw to our dogs, it costs less if I give them money and we bulk buy. I gave them the equivalent of $150 to buy my dog’s food with and they bought their dog’s food bur spent all my money saying that a girl they are friends with needed it. This girl has been pretty nasty in the past including hurting me and my older SD and stealing from me. I can’t afford to buy more of that food so my dog is on kibble that his stomachs doesn’t like. 

I have restated boundaries each time bur they don’t listen so now I am refusing to let them toilet, train or walk my dog and they are not allowed with him unsupervised. I will also no longer give them any money as they have broken my trust. 

I have PTSD due to people hurting me and my animals so are these boundaries me being overly emotional or are they fair? 

Edit: friend and I are taking a break for a few weeks. Thank you all for calling me out for not enforcing boundaries sooner, I am a bit of a doormat!

I spoke to my friend and said I am not comfortable with how many dogs we have as they have 4 so their pointer now lives at their parents and so does the reactive dog. 
They said the reason they introduced them was because he has been fine meeting the other dogs so they wanted to try: I told them not to do anything like that again unless I’m there and give full permission wich is very unlikely due to how they handled it. 

They get paid in a few days and said they would order his raw and bought me another bag of kibble which I use as a mixer and for training. The kibble was about $50 so I’m happy to call it even and accept the apology however if they fall through with the raw I’m kicking them out of my house. 

Last but not least I took my pup to grab coffee and I got him some new treats. I contemplated on what some of you said and realised that the answer was easy; I had been choosing my friend over my very adorable lifeline and for that I am the asshole. 
From now on I will be choosing him no matter what.

",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-25,"AITA for not letting my friend near my service dog unsupervised? Before I begin I love my friend and they are a great person, they just make mistakes sometimes . Please go easy on them!

I have a mastiff pup who is training to be my service dog. Recently I’ve had some issues with my friend over his care. 
Due to the nature of my disabilities they offered to help with his care when I am struggling and I agreed however they have overstepped boundaries multiple times.

Strike one: 
They offered to toilet him for me one morning when I was half asleep and I agreed. They took him into the kitchen and let their reactive dog near him. The dog is very sweet with people he knows but highly reactive with other dogs and resource guards people and food. My pup was 10  weeks old and to add neither dogs were vaccinated. Since then I caught the dog growling outside my pup’s crate with hackles and tail up. There was a door from the room I was in that lead outside so they had no reason to take him in the kitchen. They said they forgot that door was there yet they’ve lived in that house over 10 years.

124,1d03rjd,AITA:For not speaking with my Mom,"I (16yo female) moved to the U.S. from a foreign country when I was 7 years old. Prior to moving I lived with my mother as her and my father were divorced and he lived in the U.S. my father wasn’t very active in my life before I moved here with him. Even when I was here his job required him to move around a lot so I lived with my grandmother and my aunt because his wife(my step mother) was is school. 

Since moving I have only visited my mom and her family once when I was 12 years old, but I still stay in touch with my mother through FaceTime and messages. I will admit we don’t communicate as much anymore as I am very busy with school and my extracurricular activities. Additionally the 8 hour time difference makes it difficult to communicate. 

I am an only child, my father and stepmother have no children of their own as they are unfortunately unable to have kids due to their age. My mother on the other hand is still young and able to have children, but when she brought up the topic to me I said having a sibling would not be ideal because of the large age gap and the distance meaning I would never be able to see them and have a real relationship with them. My mother insisted there is nothing wrong and I’m just stubborn so we left the topic at that. 

Today she called me at 6 pm and reveals that she gave birth to a baby girl around 2 weeks ago. When she told me I turned my face away from the camera as I was in shock and had no I idea how to react to this. From what I know she hasn’t been seeing anyone since my father but she could have been keeping it a secret. My mother asked me why I wasn’t saying anything and I told her I didn’t know what to say because I was in shock. I asked her why she didn’t tell me and she said she wanted it to be a surprise. That was where the phone call ended because we had guests come over to our house. 
I feel guilty for not being happy but I’m hurt that she didn’t tell me and left me in the dark for so long, especially since she knew how I felt about having siblings. I don’t know what will happen but I feel really sad right now because I know I won’t have a relationship with the baby as I won’t be able to go back for another 3-4 years.

126,1d0300d,AITA for having a free-range guinea pig in my house?,"I (28F) have had my guinea pig, Twix, for 3 years now. I live alone, and my boyfriend of 6 months (29M) stays over at my house a lot. Twix is “free-range.” Not completely, because that would be dangerous, but he’s able to move freely between a small screened in porch area and a bedroom. I don’t have any other animals, but I don’t want to accidentally hurt him or let him hurt himself.  He has toys and water throughout the space, it’s totally his, and I love being able to provide him with more freedom than a traditional cage.

Bf has always found this gross but never made it a big deal. But it must have been boiling inside him, because when I was in the room playing with Twix the other day while bf was over, bf came into the room as well and stepped in some poop (which is bound to happen every once in a while with a free range guinea pig). Bf WENT OFF about how gross it is and how having this space for Twix was inconsiderate to him and if I loved him I would put Twix in a regular size cage and repurpose the extra room in my house for his use/more space for us to be together. My house is 2 bedrooms and like I said, I live alone, it’s not like bf officially moved in. I love Twix and I don’t think it’s fair to let someone change the way I’ve always treated him. I feel like if Twix was a dog or cat it wouldn’t be a problem because that’s seen as more normal. My mother agrees I’m not being fair to bf by “putting an animal above a person.”

Edits for clarification: 
The areas Twix has free access to are covered in rubber and PVC flooring. Basically how you would set up a playpen, just larger scale.

when we get there, Boyfriend has just gotten a new dab pen and Leah's anxious to try it. i have no issue with the two of them smoking around me and they take hits while they eat. Leah takes a larger-than-intended hit and gets very high very quickly. she tells Boyfriend that she wants to essentially jump his bones, and i laugh it off (in my own experience, i get quite horny when i'm high, so i understand and again, didn't mind. i even told her a story about how i had ""kicked a friend of mine and their partner out of their room once so i could get off"". i didn't mention that i was sexually involved with that friend at the time, as the conversation changed, and that i had said ""kicked"" for dramatic effect - the friend had offered and i had accepted.)

i told her that when she finished her water i would head right out and let them get to it. she's notorious for not hydrating and i was honestly a little worried because of how high she was. she begged me to leave so she could have sex with her boyfriend and she would drink it after. she got off the bed and began to grind on his thigh and beg me to leave.

i ended up snapping at her and asking her to stop so i could finish eating and then i would go. she got upset and i immediately felt bad, packed up my things and left.
