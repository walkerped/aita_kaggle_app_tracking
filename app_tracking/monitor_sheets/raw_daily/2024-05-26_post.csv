0,1d19qky,AITA for not telling my parents that I'm trans,"I (24F) started my social transition five months ago and my medical transition three weeks ago. My siblings and my friends know, but not my parents nor my extended family. 

However, I dress in a very feminine way most of the time, and my parents have caught on that something is going on that I'm not telling them. My mom asked me if I was trans a couple of months ago and I gave her an indecisive answer (tbf I was actually indecisive back then).

My siblings are mad at me because they say that I'm keeping them in the dark and making them confused and worried for no reason. Let me say that I'm not worried that they'll be transphobic or not accept me or whatever, I'm just not emotionally ready to tell them and just find coming outs awkward, so I'm just basically waiting for it to be obvious enough that it doesn't really become a shock to them when they officially find out.

1,1d0rsid,AITA for “slandering” my mom to the rest of my family ,"Yesterday I made plans with some friends to hang out at their house to make smores. My mom gave me permission to go but refused to drive me so my friends picked me up, which I already was mad at my mom about bc the friend only lives 5 minutes away and my mom was planning to leave the house pretty soon anyway. I never asked my mom what time I should be home by but I assumed she would tell me if it was urgent. Well time passes and now it’s around 9:30 pm so I call my mom to ask if she can pick me up on 10. I call her in front of my friends and friends parents bc I didn’t think it would be a big deal. She goes off on me saying she can’t pick me up bc she has to wake up at 4 am for church and I that I should’ve know better than to stay out so late and I’d better call a taxi or Uber or beg my friend to drop me off at home bc she shouldn’t have to deal with me if I choose to “go out to the streets”. I try to stay calm because again I’m in front of everyone so I just ask her “why are you mad at me” and again she just starts repeating everything she said then abruptly hangs up, essentially abandoning me (yes ik that i was safe/not in danger but the fact that she would even do that really hurt my feelings). She made my dad come and get me even though he’d just gotten back home from working All day (I didn’t call him for that reason). I get home and don’t speak to her but 10pm rolls around and she’s chatting on the phone with my aunt which confused me because she just claimed she couldn’t pick me up because she had to be asleep by 10. 


I would be able to drive myself if we had more parking space or if she’d just let me drive her car. No I wasn’t on the streets like she said. I was in a middle class suburban neighborhood and she has no reason to not trust me. I’ve been friends with this person for 9 years now and she’s met them. I go out with friends 1-2 times every 2 months and each time it’s to go to a restaurant or each others houses. I’m also a really good kid otherwise and I thought that after I got into Cornell, Princeton, and UMich and then committed to Princeton she’d finally be nice to me. 


This morning I asked my mom about why she couldn’t pick me up and she just replied “you can run around being a ho god knows where but don’t get me involved”. Later on some family came over but I was still visibly upset so my aunt asked me what was wrong and I basically had a break down about it all. I tell her everything that happened and that I don’t understand why she’s like with me. My aunt lectured my mom and ofc my mom got mad at me for making her look bad.

3,1d0rdvb,AITA for not responding to a friend who’s experiencing serious anxiety?,"To start, 11 years ago whilst I was at university, I (now F30, from the UK) made a friend online from the USA (now F27), we became friends over shared interests and the fact we’d had similar experiences growing up as we were both autistic. One thing I learnt quickly is that she did not have a good childhood at all. Her parents were neglectful and abusive and for the most part she was basically left to raise herself. Over the years we became very close as friends and remained in regular contact.

Now back to the present, in the past year she managed to move to Las Vegas from California to get away from her family. This is where things took a turn. It started when she was struggling to find work. She was getting extreme anxiety over said struggle, and although I tried to be supportive, understanding and encouraging, all I was met back with was anger and hostility (something of which I did not need at the time as my partner had just been fired from their job, so we were both feeling similar anxiety). It got to the point where I felt afraid to say anything without feeling like I was just making things worse.

She also began requesting video calls on Facebook and immediately hanging up just to get my attention during moments of said anxiety so I’d be able to respond fast.

It got worse in December when she broke a clavicle during a car accident (for reference, at this point she had/has a casino job). She was panicking that she would never be able to work again and would be homeless. Despite my attempts to understand and reassure her the injury alone shouldn’t stop her from working again, next morning I woke to lots of angry messages about how she would be homeless and how she hated that people were downplaying her issues.

I’ve really wanted to help, but I started to feel like I was being mistreated. At this point I was only ever being messaged when she had an issue, and although she did apologise when I explained how I was going through a lot of my own issues and started to talk more calmly, she still only talked to me whenever she had an issue.

Two things happened that made me feel I had enough. One was where she tried to get my help right as I was on a train in pain from what was later revealed to be a broken hand, and another when she tried calling me right when I was in the middle of a work shift. Granted, she couldn’t have known I had an accident or that I was working, but it made me feel like I was just a form of therapy rather than a friend. She even once said she needed some “therapy” from me. I know I should talk to her directly about how I’m feeling, but I can’t help but feel afraid she will get angry again.

I do still talk to her. But as I can’t help but feel anxiety (and some personal stuff going on), I’ve been much slower to respond. These past few days I’ve just not been able to respond at all. Nobody’s directly called me an asshole or even hinted at it, but I can’t help but feel I am and that I’m abandoning a friend in need.

4,1d0rc48,AITA for asking a man in his 40s to leash his large dog that keeps running up and barking at a disabled woman with a 🦯,"I was confused at first because this dog was running off leash to groups of people at a park. and nobody called when he ran up to a disabled person (appeared to have downs syndrome) who was walking with a white cane and singing. Given, she was walking kind of funny so I understand why the dog freaked out, ran up, and was barking. 

She froze and the dog backed off.

Once she starts walking again, the dog runs up, starts barking, disable woman screams and jumps to the side and cowers. She doesn't move until the dog runs away again.

Finally, the dog runs to the people right in front of me.  People in their 40's lounging on a park bench appear to be those the people who never left this small town after highschool.

The woman walks past this couple and they seem to be looking and snickering at her behavior.  Their dog crouches and walks towards her again.

I take a couple of steps forward, ""hey, is your dog?"" clearly confused how they had zero response to what was going on.

They appear to not have been bothered, so I explain what has taken place. As the disabled woman is walking towards the center of the park, I ask if they can leash their dog because she seemed afraid. This guy gets incredibly defensive that his dog is well trained and adamant that he saw what happened and it wasn't a problem because his dog is friendly.

Clearly the dog is scared of the woman and the woman is scared of the dog, but kind of not able to defend herself.

At this point, in my mind, this guy isn't someone to reason with so I just say, hey, please leash your dog because she's scared and there's leash laws here. Nope.

At least the dog is sitting right in front of me by this point because I have a piece of pizza in hand.

By happenstance a cop pulls up to the park and I walk over and explain the situation that the dog had run up to the woman barking, the disabled woman is clearly afraid of the dog, and the owners are doing nothing. He said he'll chat with them.

I go back to what I was doing on the other side of the other side of the park. While the cop is talking to him, the guy points at me, I wave, and just go back to what I was doing. He puts the dog on a leash.

After the cop leaves, this guy brings his 10 y/o over to throw a football and starts saying ""are you even local, are you from here? You should leave town now, you better watch out"". 

At this point, I just ignore this guy and do my thing. He walks back by me, takes his fingers from his eyes and points to me and says ""you better watch out"". 

The fact that he was threatening me gives me pause to the whole situation.

I think the family dynamics are slowly settling and I’m seen as the more “stricter” (I.e. probably overbearing) type that tries to provide routine, structure and safety to my child. My husband does the same but being an LCSW he takes a different approach. I do have anxiety and can get flustered easily which has always been my personal struggle since my teenage years. For the past few weeks/month or two my son constantly mouths “f*** you” to me all the time with a smirk on his face. My husband is OBLIVIOUS to these types of boundary pushes even when I ask him to pay a little more attention.

Cut to this weekend. My in-laws are up for the long weekend. We went out to an outdoor festival for the day and all day my son continues to push my boundaries, refusing to listen, mouthing “f*** you and “you little shit” and ignoring anything I ask. I tried putting up with it all day until this evening. Originally I told him bedtime was 8:15pm but then my husband told him he can stay up until 9:15pm without telling me. Which is fine and wasn’t my frustration. Well we are all sitting in the living room and when it’s time for my son to go to bed, I keep stating “ok it’s bedtime”. He ignores me until I repeat myself a few times and the turns to me and mouth “f*** you” with my husband and in-laws sitting right there. I finally got fed up and yelled “it’s time for bed” and he went off to bed with my husband tucking him in.

My husband is pissed for how I presented myself in front of his parents but I’m super upset and annoyed at how my son continues to speak to me and was just finally exhausted from it. I took the PS5 away and locked it in my office until I feel he can start straighten himself up. Was I in the wrong? Should I have just taken it until everyone went to bed and just removed the PS5? I feel like I should have done that. But was I the asshole who flipped out in front of everyone?

One thing VERY significant about A is that she and I are very close. To the point where I'd say she was my special person. And when she blew up on me my already tanking mental health hit rock bottom. Now I feel like I was the asshole for not asking first so hears the question.

8,1d0qqae,AITA for taking my friends credit card away from him?,"I (24M) have a friend (23M) that has horrible spending habits. He will come back from a trip out with 20 unnecessary things, and at minimum 100 dollar receipts. He buys things like take out, kitchen gadgets, little toys, infomercial products he never uses. I once saw him throw a whole xbox into the cart (he already has one). I promptly reminded him that he had one already, he responded “but this one is black.” He now has two xbox series S in two different colors.

He works a minimum wage job so he struggles to pay for anything essential. He always has to beg his mother for the change to pay for his apartment. I always tell him to stop, and he says he will work on it and budget better, but I see no changes. His mother also buys him groceries and he doesn’t own a car, but he ends up not having money for anything he needs.

He also has an addiction to collecting exotic fish. He will spend 2 hours sometimes perusing Facebook marketplace for his newest salt water fish that he can barely feed. Some of them started dropping dead from the water being so murky because he can’t afford a new filter.

He also has crippling credit card debt. He opted for the option to pay it over time slowly but he always amasses more somehow.

I had enough and to help his sorry ass out, I threw his credit card into a sewer drain. He can get a replacement but at least he won’t do it for awhile because his mother helps him manage his bank, and she only visits once a month.",Asshole,2024-05-26,"AITA for taking my friends credit card away from him?

Our relationship was rocky, and to be honest pretty unhealthy. I broke things off with him for good, and he decided to move out and let me have the apartment (We are both on the lease, which is important for later.). He still has things at the apartment and his key.

Let's just say he isn't being the healthiest about our break up, and I don't go a week without him blowing up my phone over something. He'll text me and tell me how miserable he is one time and then text me about how happy he is about everything. He's trying to get me to reach out to him, but it hasn't been working until now. 

He texted me today his information for an account he set up with Byte for me and asked me to take over the payments on it. If you don't know, Byte is a company that sells aligners for teeth straightening. Let me just put it out there that I never asked for this product, and was very comfortable with my body and appearance, but he wasn't. One of the reasons we broke up was because he was always criticizing my weight, teeth, and just body in general. No matter how much I told him it hurt me, he would tell me I was making a big deal over nothing and that he was just trying to encourage me to ""better myself"". He bought me the Byte aligners for Christmas, even though I told him that he didn't have to buy me such an expensive gift. I've been struggling with money since I've been trying to pay off my debts, so I wasn't able to get him anything super expensive like that. He insisted, and got them for me anyway.

My parents are separated. My grandfather provides for my mother and our family while my uncle provides me with my pocket money. I live in an apartment building and both my grandfather and uncle reside in the same building.

I am currently feeding 3 stray dogs regularly. As a result, they have started to wait for me day and night in the building's surrounding area. Any person that they think is me, they immediately gather around them. The society members have not raised any complaints against it.

However, my uncle has. He said that his daughters (he has two adult daughters and one has a newborn baby) get scared of the dogs because they surround them when they're walking with the newborn (they do so once a week).

I argued that those 3 dogs are strays, and they also will run away if you even lift a finger at them. They are scaredy cats. My uncle asked me to feed them outside the society's gate and I agreed. However, he is now telling me to stop doing that as well because they follow anyone they think is me.

My grandfather sided with my uncle and told me to stop feeding them as well.

I still want to continue feeding them and I have been distressed about it. I don't want to be disrespectful to my elders so I have kept quiet about it, and have tried to feed them in secret.

I live on a side street next to a private high school, and on Saturdays they often have a ton of sports games. On especially busy days, people will often park on the side streets rather than parking in the parking lots, as my street is closer to the fields where the games are played.

I park my siblings' and I's shared car on the street, as our driveway is taken up by my parent's cars. I usually park right in front of my house, and as I turned into my neighborhood and saw how packed the street was with cars, I was worried my spot would be taken.

12,1d0pgmy,AITA for making a one-off gibe at my brother’s girlfriend’s fake boobs and fake nose after her and my brother insulted my Hinge matches?,"I [22M] went hiking with my brother [27M] and his girlfriend [25F] yesterday. I told them 2 weeks ago that I just got on Hinge. My brother asked me about how that was going while we were on the hike. I showed him my matches and a few noteworthy conversations. His girlfriend seemed interested too as I was showing them the stuff on my phone.

After showing him 3 conversations, he asked me why I’m wasting time chatting with ugly girls. I asked him if he was busting my balls or if he really thought they were all ugly. He said those 3 are ugly and told me to show him a hot one out of my 30 other matches. I showed him one who I felt was pretty hot. He said that she’s like a 6 at best and asked his girlfriend what she thought. His girlfriend said “no comment” with a smirk.

I didn’t appreciate that arrogance out of her. My brother kind of pissed me off a bit, but his girlfriend pushed me over the edge. She teases me sometimes and seems to have an inflated ego, but I have never heard her put down another girl’s looks before. What really makes that worse is that she got a boob job and a nose job last year. Sure, she might be considered LA hot now, but I felt like I needed to check her ego.

I said that at least none of these girls I matched with have “more silicone than brain”. My brother’s girlfriend isn’t that dumb. That was the first gibe I could think of. I read that on an online forum a few years back when a user commented that phrase on a thread with photos of a plastic-looking model and I always thought it was funny. This was the first time I used it in real life. I tease my brother’s girlfriend sometimes too, but never about her appearance. I don’t like going there. She’s usually cool with my teasing.

However, this time, both my brother and his girlfriend were triggered. My brother told me that was super low of me and to never talk to his girlfriend that way. His girlfriend said that she didn’t even mean to imply with her “no comment” comment that she thought the girls were ugly, just that they were not as pretty as I probably thought they were. I said “sure” in a dragged and disbelievingly tone. She said I had the privilege to continue simping over these girls if that tickled my pickle. I told her I will. The rest of the hike wasn’t as bad as I had thought it was going to be. We were able to get back close enough to how it was before.

Later last night, my brother called me. He said that he shouldn’t have ragged on my matches the way he did, but also said that I shouldn’t have said what I said in retaliation. I told him that he’s right, but that he needed to check his girlfriend’s ever-inflating ego. He asked me what I was talking about. I said that she’s displaying more bitchy tendencies every time I see her. He didn’t even ask me to elaborate.

It was a very stressful and toxic environment that I did not want us to stay in.

My son’s birthday is this Monday and, since my ex and I were not in such really good terms when we separated, I made plans to have a small celebration with two of my girl friends from work and their kids (5M and 3M). 

About two weeks ago, my ex said he regretted his actions and wanted us to try again. I was hesitant because I didn’t want to fall in the same pattern again but I can’t deny that I would love for us to be together and be a family again. 

I told him about the plans for our son‘s birthday and he always seemed to get upset about it because he said he also wanted to be part of it, but I told him that I really wanted to stick to the plan since he and his family hadn’t given me any other options either. He later suggested going to a water park the day before, so the 3 of us could celebrate and I agreed to that since I thought it would be fun. 

Today we got into an argument because last night I sent him a picture and a video of when I was pregnant because I was very emotional and he didn’t reply back until later today and didn’t mention anything about that at all. When I told him I was upset that he didn’t even acknowledge what I had sent him, he blew up and started saying that he did see it, he just ‘didn’t know what to respond to that’ and that ‘I always do this to him’. What he meant by that was that I share my feelings and want to talk about it when I’m upset.

15,1d1eez5,"AITA for not inviting my friend to my birthday party, after they didn't let me crash at their place even though they offered it in the first place? ","A few weeks ago I was struggling with where I was going to sleep for a week since I had no money to book a place whilst my new apartment was handed to me. About a month before moving, I told a friend F(24), lets call her Leslie, how worried I was and that I hadn't been able to find another place. At the time she offered to help and said I could crash on her living room or her floor (if her roomates weren't cool with me using the sofa.) 

Two weeks passed and I called her to ask if this was still an option, because I would need to crash for four days, planning on staying also with another friend. She didn't say no, but she beated around the bush and said she would let me know, that she needed to discuss with her romates and so on and on. A few days later I met with some friends in a bar, I was enjoying the night, trying not to worry about the whole thing, however Leslie was there (because of friends I introduced to her) and found time to complain to me about her problems, how she hasn't found a job and how she is very unhappy with her partner. Brief parenthesis: she has been looking for a job for over a year now, but won't do any kinda job, she says the supermarket is beneath her. I would do any odd job I can get if I was in her situation.

The time passed, another friend helped me out and was so kind about letting me stay on his sofa, not accepting any payment and even being surprised when I cooked for him and did the dishes.

A few weeks ago I was struggling with where I was going to sleep for a week since I had no money to book a place whilst my new apartment was handed to me. About a month before moving, I told a friend F(24), lets call her Leslie, how worried I was and that I hadn't been able to find another place. At the time she offered to help and said I could crash on her living room or her floor (if her roomates weren't cool with me using the sofa.) 

Two weeks passed and I called her to ask if this was still an option, because I would need to crash for four days, planning on staying also with another friend. She didn't say no, but she beated around the bush and said she would let me know, that she needed to discuss with her romates and so on and on. A few days later I met with some friends in a bar, I was enjoying the night, trying not to worry about the whole thing, however Leslie was there (because of friends I introduced to her) and found time to complain to me about her problems, how she hasn't found a job and how she is very unhappy with her partner. Brief parenthesis: she has been looking for a job for over a year now, but won't do any kinda job, she says the supermarket is beneath her. I would do any odd job I can get if I was in her situation.

The time passed, another friend helped me out and was so kind about letting me stay on his sofa, not accepting any payment and even being surprised when I cooked for him and did the dishes.

I essentially have to spend $650 on her bachelorette party. I spent $100 on my dress and i’m going to have to spend $1.5k-$2k for my husband and I to travel and stay. not to mention i’m also helping out the bride with some custom decor/items she wants (i have a few professional machines to do so). 

I was added to this groupchat with the bridesmaids (no bride). I have no idea who any of these people are, im also the LEAST close to the bride in the group (me and her husband served in the military together). myself and the bride are great friends but we aren’t super close.

Everyone in the groupchat got on a document together and we made a list to sign up for items to be in charge of getting for the bachelorette party. i signed up for the custom shirts, custom cowboy hats, and a lots of other party decor. a week AFTER we signed up, it was decided by 2 girls that you have to cover the cost of whatever you chose to get. which is BS because some girls are bringing cups and plates. some others are spending around $200. i’m spending $650. 

So i screenshotted the custom shirt total (it was $300 and the only thing we’re custom ordering elsewhere) and my venmo. sent those into the chat, asked everyone to cover their own shirt ($30 ea). One girl paid. The next girl told me her charcuterie board was $130. Another told me i should be glad this isn’t a destination event (but it is for me!). the rest didn’t respond. 

i don’t want to start drama. bride and i have a good relationship but i don’t know what telling her about this would do. so im thinking of calling my buddy and dropping out, considering the $300 lost a present for the bride, and attending the wedding normally so no more money, time, or effort is wasted.

I said in a slightly angry term “can you please stop asking me that you ask me every single time I see you”. I did not mean to be or come off rude but it really pisses me off. Kind of like when I was a little kid and he asked me if I had a girlfriend yet. That brought me to tears one time.

But the problem is nobody was doing anything and all totally silent it’s fucking boring and I wanted to leave and I did. I was talking to my mom later and she mentioned that my dad was all pissed off still and also was angry at me for “lashing out” on my grandfather. 
I don’t feel comfortable talking about school. I have stated multiple times that I don’t know when it is going to start. And I have answered the question many more. It really got on my nerves because it’s all anybody not even my grandfather asks. Non stop.

19,1d1de91,AITA for arguing with my sister over moisturiser?,"I (16M) have a skin condition called psoriasis. It is very annoying to deal with and gets very itchy when it is bad. I went to a dermatologist with my Mum and she gave a prescription for steroid cream and non-steroid cream that help clear the psoriasis and a moisturiser to use on it and some of my dry skin. My Mum bought them for me and they were quite pricey. I don’t know the exact price but it was quite expensive and the dermatologist appointment to get them was €150-€250. I normally leave all three in the bathroom that I share with my siblings as I need to use the mirror to apply the creams.

The issue I’ve been having with my sister (24F) is I caught her using the moisturiser which got me a bit mad. I told her to not use it and she said ‘You don’t even use much of it’ which is true but my Mum bought it for me to use. I told her she could easily afford to buy her own if she stopped buying clothes and going on expensive trips with her friends and boyfriend. She got angry and said that since she has to pay for some of her masters degree in college (My parents are paying the rest) that she can’t afford it. It was an obvious lie. I grabbed all three of my bottles of stuff and put them in my room so I can just bring them to the bathroom when I’m using them then bring them back to my room. This pisses her off since she can’t use it. She is giving me the cold shoulder and saying I am just petty and that since my Mum pays for it, it shouldn’t matter to me whether she is using it or not since my Mum can just buy more.

I was fine with the idea because I loved spending time with those two.

Yesterday I was doing my homework in my room and my mom (F39) suddenly came in my room and told me that “they wanted to see me.” I was like “yeah sure that’s fine.” So they spent about 15 minutes in my room crawling around and i was hanging out with them, trying to entertain them as best as I could. 

As I’m playing peekaboo with my 2-year old cousin, I see the other little rascal (I’m not saying that to be mean) was trying to reach for one of my shelves. I was confused, so I asked him “what are you doing?” and he told me he wanted to play with the bunny stuffed animal that was on that shelf. I said no, as that was my childhood stuffed animal and I don’t want a kid slobbering on it and playing with it (again, not to be rude).

My mom was in the room supervising us just in case something wrong had happened, and told me not to be so mean because he’s just a little kid but I told her again that I didn’t want them touching it as it’s mine and I shouldn’t have to let them play with it just because they’re my younger cousins.

She told my I was overreacting and being a total bitch because it’s “just a stuffed animal” and gave them it. I got mad at her because she can’t just do that?? Again, it’s MINE and I have the right to not want to share it with them.

I immediately took it back and placed it back on the shelf. My 4-year old cousin started breaking down when i did so and i just shrugged it off. I did apologize, saying “sorry guys but i just don’t want you playing with that toy, but I have others for you” because I didn’t want to worsen the problem.

A lot of this wedding has been budget friendly and centered around that, which is really nice considering that most of us are young with entry level salaries, not to mention how expensive things are at the moment. The only thing i’ve had to do so far is buy my bridesmaid dress, which I expected. In accordance to the dress, i have to buy round trip flights for my husband and i, book an air bnb, and we’re going to have to get a rental car since this will be in a rural area. 

All good things that i agreed to when i got the invitation and bridesmaid proposal seven months ago. I even talked to the bride and told her that if she needs anything custom made i could make her things for the wedding. So her and i have coordinated a few things for me to help her out with. 

The issue that im having started two weeks ago when I was added to a bachelorette group chat (without the bride). The girl who added us sent a message stating that we are in charge of the bachelorette party, including inspo pics sent by the bride on how she wants it to be. 

Girls were sending links to party decor/food ideas/etc. I sent in a pic of custom shirts among many things, and everyone loved them and wanted them. i mentioned ordering the shirts from the seller i saw them from and making everything else (between party items and bride’s wedding items, it’s a lot of stuff to make meaning lots of time). everyone agreed. 

I signed up for matching shirts and matching custom cowgirl hats… two main things that were requested by the bride. i also did some party decor that i could make. i’m like etsy-level crafty and could easily make a lot of this stuff. Custom shirts would be $300, Custom cowgirl hats are $200, the rest of the decor is around $150, and im also helping the bride out for other wedding items. 

A week after we all signed up for respective things for the party, someone finally inquired about how to split the funding. Another said that we should all just pay for what we signed up for. Apparently I missed this message and saw it two days later.

Some girls are spending max $200. Some are just bringing cups and plates. I’m spending $650 and that’s a rough estimate. I really don’t mind spending around $300, so i screenshotted the custom t shirt order, my venmo, sent those two pics and asked if everyone could cover their own shirt (id cover mine, bride, shipping and handling). 

one girl paid. two others replied to me and said “well weddings are expensive, we should be glad that none of this is destination hahaha!”…. it is for me. the other said “well the charcuterie board is $130 and i’m not even done getting items for it yet.”

i have to pay $650 party, $1500- $2k traveling, $100 dress, and help out the bride with her items. That’s a lot of time and money for me and i’m literally the least close to the bride out of the group. i’m actually bummed i can’t be with the groomsmen id much rather be a part of my best friend’s side of the night.

I would normally start calling people out but i don’t know ANY of these people. only the bride groom and some military buddies attending. i thought about talking to the bride about this but what could that do? start drama? people are already weirded out by me as the grooms best friend.

22,1d1d2lf,AITA because I want equal access to my son’s phone as his dad?,"Update:  Thanks for the responses, especially those who recognized I’m in a tough spot.  The line between “controlling” and “parenting” can be very fine and for anyone who is a parent, you know it’s not for the weak.  

That being said, I’ve decided I am not going to pursue the two different phones or access to the app anymore.  It is more damaging to my son and my relationship than it is beneficial.  I need to spend the energy on mirroring the behavior I wish to see from him, or focus on building a better relationship with him in other ways.  I do not plan to abandon all management of the phone, because despite the opinions of some, a 14 year old kid needs boundaries. But that’s what I want it to look like - boundaries, not control.  

Thanks again, everyone. 

OP: Looking for sympathetic honesty, please.  

I (43F) share 50/50 custody of my 14 year old son with my ex husband (44M.)  We were married for 15 years and have been divorced about 8 years now.  His father remarried about 7 years ago.  My son has one step sibling about 4 years younger than him.  We have been high conflict coparenting for at least a few years.

When our son was about 10/11, his father got him a cell phone.  He did not ask my opinion because he knew I wouldn’t approve at such a young age.  Since that point in time, my son has been constantly on the phone, and emotionally attached to any regulation to using the phone.  His father uses an app to manage his access and monitor his use, but I have been denied access to that app.  When I take the phone from my son, whether it’s because it’s a distraction from his homework or he’s just been on it too long, my son gets extremely hateful towards me.  I’ve learned to not let that bother me as much but it is apparent that my son feels like because I do not pay for the phone, I should not have access to the phone.  He also thinks I shouldn’t have access to his phone due to his right to privacy, despite his only being 14 and the only thing I’ve asked for is the equal amount of access to his phone as his father and stepmother have.  No more and no less.  
A lot of back and forth has happened in the last three years since he’s had the phone but  I recently told my ex that if we cannot settle on a shared app, our son will have a phone at each house instead.  He warned me that our son will be mad at me. My son already told me he wants to live with his dad most of the time, but it is because there is a lack of structure and discipline in his dad’s home and it has historically been this way as they do not want to have to enforce rules on the younger child either.)

Basically, I guess I’m wondering if I’m making too much of the phone thing? Should I burden my kid with putting up with two phones for this reason? Or AITA who just seemingly wants to control everything? ",Not enough info,2024-05-26,"AITA because I want equal access to my son’s phone as his dad? Update:  Thanks for the responses, especially those who recognized I’m in a tough spot.  The line between “controlling” and “parenting” can be very fine and for anyone who is a parent, you know it’s not for the weak.  

That being said, I’ve decided I am not going to pursue the two different phones or access to the app anymore.  It is more damaging to my son and my relationship than it is beneficial.  I need to spend the energy on mirroring the behavior I wish to see from him, or focus on building a better relationship with him in other ways.  I do not plan to abandon all management of the phone, because despite the opinions of some, a 14 year old kid needs boundaries. But that’s what I want it to look like - boundaries, not control.  

Thanks again, everyone.

23,1d1d1y8,AITA for telling husband his family is disrespectful of ours?,"We had a wonderful holiday weekend planned that included a large birthday party at our house for our 5 year old daughter. I work in healthcare, so I had to request off months ago to be off this whole weekend. We planned the birthday party for months. The day finally came, after days of setting up. 6 days before the party, though, my husband’s brother announces he’s coming to town (not for his niece’s birthday, a coincidence). So, they are going golfing, which of course takes 7 hours, but my mother in law was going to watch them while I got the house back in order the day after that party.  My husband comes to me 30 minutes into the party and says, I am actually golfing tomorrow morning even earlier (leaving our house at 6:30am), and my mom doesn’t get up that early, so she can’t take the kids. I told my husband, no. We can talk about it after the guests leave, but not going to work…we needed to rest and get our house back in order. That had been the plan for months. 

Later we talked, and he said it wasn’t his decision to go earlier or that his mom couldn’t help. It wasn’t his decision, it was his family’s (brother and father). I said you still have the option not to go, and that’s what I’m asking you to do, not tomorrow morning. He continues to say it’s not his decision. I say it is. Ultimately I get to the point I’m saying his family is disrespectful our ours and of our time. The worst part is that they told him of this change during our child’s party. Even worse, my husband seemed to agree the decision to change plans last minute seemed inconsiderate of them, but he still went. My poor children had a crappy exhausted mom solo today.

AITA for telling my brother I hate him and I’ll probably never be able to forgive him 

Background I 27f and brother 25m were raised by a single dad our mom left we didn’t really have family so we only had each other. I’ll refer to my dad as dad and brother as James. Fast forward to 18 year old me my dad was diagnosed with schizophrenia that took a lot on me mentally because my brother refused to help. My dad accepted help and was put on medication fast forward to 23 year old me my dad had a stroke and was diagnosed with heart failure. I was the sole care taker and it was breaking me. He still worked and could fully function unless he had an episode which was rare with the meds. Fast forward I move out of the state for my peace and a break my brother James promised to step up. September of 22 I could tell my dad was going off the deep end so I called James to advise of POA rights James told me I was being dramatic and didn’t need to worry about it cause I was selfish and left. Fast forward November 2 days go by I didn’t hear from my dad. I called a welfare check and they found him deceased believed heart attack. I immediately flew back home that day. When I get there james drunkenly confesses to me he seen him the day before and describe him as “unrecognizable, sick, couldn’t eat, move or anything.” James brought him some energy drinks and left quoting “if it was that bad he’s an adult and would’ve asked to go to the doctor.” I stood there stunned. No words. My brother kept pushing me to say something when finally I snapped and said “I hate you, I’ll probably never forgive you for this. The one time you had to be an adult you couldn’t and had you did there’s a possibility he could still be alive today.” He called me a heartless b* and now all of my family is saying the same but I feel my feelings are valid so AITA? 

Edit to add: I understand eventually I would have had to come to terms with him dying, but the part I’m angriest about is my brother robbed me of his final moments, I didn’t get to say goodbye. I didn’t get to tell him how much he meant to me. I didn’t get to tell him how he was my hero. I didn’t get to say thank you for still loving me everyday when my birth mom left us cause we were a burden. I feel like I was robbed of so many things. 

Edit 2: I did explain to the police the next week what happened and exactly what my brother had told me when the autopsy on my father was performed. When I spoke to the detective they said basically I was SOL because I had no proof other than his confession that I also had no proof of. An because I couldn’t concretely prove my dad was in a manic state at the time of the incident that nothing really could be done especially giving the heart failure diagnosis that was given 2 years prior. I also want to say thank you so much for all of the support even the non supportive ones. I understand that me leaving the state did make me responsible and I take accountability for that and regret that everyday. But I have taken up seeing a therapist who specializes in grief. Ive been very angry for a long time. My dad had living brother and sisters and a dad who lived in the same state who knew everything and also did nothing. I guess while my main focused anger has been at my brother for a long time I’m angry at everyone who I begged to help who promised they would and didn’t. Either way there’s a lot of comments and I can’t really keep up through the tears. But I again want to say thank you.

25,1d1clmy,AITA For asking my boyfriend to speak to me differently? ,"I’ll try to condense this…

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years. We both rock climb and we were at the climbing gym the other day together when he started to say “it’s okay” that I fell off a boulder problem. 

Now he is a much stronger climber than I am and usually warms up in the things I try very hard to climb. That’s fine. What bothers me is that I know it’s okay to fall, and I wasn’t even upset about it. I know he means well by it, but to me it feels condescending and unhelpful. 

This time, when he said it to me, I gently said:

 “hey, can I talk to you about something really quick? I know you mean it encouragingly, but when I come off a problem and you say “it’s okay”, it doesn’t feel that way to me. It feels kind of condescending..and I KNOW you don’t mean it that way, but it just doesn’t feel very encouraging to me…Do you think we could think of some other phrases that are more encouraging?”

In the moment he said yeah of course, but later that night we got in an argument and he told
Me what I said earlier was disrespectful. I tried to explain I didn’t intend to hurt him by it, but rather just wanted to let him know and see if he could find another phrase. He told me that it was my problem that it didn’t feel encouraging and that I shouldn’t have brought it up. I told him I thought it was actually really helpful to bring up when we don’t like the way one of us is speaking to the other and it’s something that really isn’t an issue if we can come together on it.

He started to raise his voice and told me he’s mad because I can’t see that I’m just wrong and disrespectful in this situation. He said that’s my own shit I need to figure out and he’ll say whatever he wants to.

A brief background on James, he is one of those guys that was always the group leader, and is used to having all of the control.

Initially, James added a distant friend to the group. We were all confused as he did not fit into the friend group and some of us did not know him that well. But we thought nothing of it as the distant friend is a pretty cool guy. But him and one of the other guys(llet's call him Chris) in the group decided add their siblings. Now, our friend group does know their siblings pretty well. But they do not really fit the group. They are few years older than us and have a tendency to take control.  Furthermore, James, Chris and their siblings are all best friends. I'm afraid that if we plan this trip like this, the trip will have 2 factions which simply will not be as fun.

I did something when I was younger that I was not proud of and trusted her to keep it a secret ( mind you I had only told like 3 people) but anyways, she was notoriously known for talking shit about people and had a lot of enemies because of it. I was always too distracted to notice, but I found out a lot of people didn’t like me either just because I was friends with her. Anyways, we had been recently growing distant because we had gotten in to multiple fights. So, I was talking to my other friends and turns out that she was talking shit about me A LOT and had a code names for me like whale, safe to say I was extremely pissed. Then somehow it got brought up by one of our other friends that she had actually told a lot of people the secret she PINKY PROMISED never to tell. I was furious and started to scream at her in front of a crowd

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-26,"AITA for screaming at my now ex best friend in front of everyone? Me and my best friend have always been really close for the past two years when we met. She was probably the most toxic person I had ever met, but I was so happy that we were as close as we were. We shared so many secrets with eachother that we promised we would never tell a soul. I did something when I was younger that I was not proud of and trusted her to keep it a secret ( mind you I had only told like 3 people) but anyways, she was notoriously known for talking shit about people and had a lot of enemies because of it. I was always too distracted to notice, but I found out a lot of people didn’t like me either just because I was friends with her. Anyways, we had been recently growing distant because we had gotten in to multiple fights. So, I was talking to my other friends and turns out that she was talking shit about me A LOT and had a code names for me like whale, safe to say I was extremely pissed. Then somehow it got brought up by one of our other friends that she had actually told a lot of people the secret she PINKY PROMISED never to tell. I was furious and started to scream at her in front of a crowd

My parents live in India, as does my Aunt.

My father in law will always visit my parents and my aunt when he visits India; my parents and Aunt live next door to each other.

My father in law visited India earlier this year and I asked my husband to ask his father to not visit my Aunt, because she and my parents weren’t on speaking terms. My husband said my father in law complained that I was bring him into a family argument that wasn’t his but he ultimately agreed not to visit her house.

Last week,  I received an olive branch from my cousin, Aunt’s daughter, who invited me to a birthday party.

I’d like to go but my father in law has started to complain very forcefully that he’d lose face if I attended the party, because he didn’t visit my aunt when he went to India.

I don’t see a problem: my cousin and I weren’t speaking then but are speaking now. My husband had shown no support, and is on his father’s side and says inshould have never involved him.

I feel upset as I thought I could count on some support from my in laws.

33,1d1b920,AITA for calling a girl overdramatic when she was crying after rear-ending me? ,"Last weekend, I attended my brother’s college graduation. After the ceremony, I found the rear of my trunk had been hit. The other driver was still there. She was an 18 year old who was crying hysterically while her mom tried to calm her down. The girl apologized profusely and said she had overestimated how much room she had to back out and hit my car. I wasn’t upset because mistakes happen. I asked if she had insurance and she was too worked up to answer. So, I turned to her mom and she said yes, they’d go get it as well as call the police so there could be an official report for the insurance company. Cool. The girl was still really worked up. I told her, it’s fine. Don’t worry about it. I’m not upset and accidents happen.
 
She’s still a mess when the cops show up. I found this a little overdramatic and admittedly rolled my eyes. I obviously don’t know this girl but it was beginning to feel like she was trying to manipulate her way out of trouble-even though the cop and I both said these things happen and that the insurance would likely take care of it. Eventually, the police left. I told the girl to calm down, it’s over and stop being dramatic. Then, I got in my car and was ready to leave.
 
My sister was with me the whole time. She told me I was unnecessarily mean to the girl. I said she was being overdramatic for no reason, especially as no one yelled at her the entire time. My sister pointed out this girl is likely a new driver, probably worried she ruined whoever she was there to celebrate, etc. Plus, she’s probably worried about her rates going up. Or maybe she has anxiety or whatever. Even if she was trying to manipulate with tears, I didn’t “have to be a dick”. I shrugged it off and let it go. So far, her insurance has been cooperative and it seems this will all be resolved rather quickly.
 
The subject came up at the party we had for my brother. Most of my family thought I was being a dick. Though some agreed she needed to calm down. AITA?

they went to prom but during the night, she was sending me message when i was watching tv with our mom, where she was crying and feeling alone. i tried to cheer her up to go have fun and forget that she’s lonely, make new friend and go dance with her date. after exchanging messages with her, i decided to sleep a bit because we were supposed to hang out after all together for their after prom. 

i woke up around 11pm with screams coming from the kitchen. my brother was mad that we couldn’t go hang out because she ruined the night. my mom was mad so she went to bed. i decided to go to bed too because i was really tired. she tried to talk to me but i couldn’t listen clearly i really wanted to crash. so i told her that we’ll talk in the morning. 

the next day, i’ve got her side. from her side, he was being really touchy with him and so she tried to get away from him all night. when i talked to him, he was really devasted, he only wanted to dance with her, taking pictures but she rejected him and stayed with other girls, mocking him and not letting him approach her even to talk. he also told me that he always asked her when he wanted to touch her to dance, put his arm around her waist or shoulder, etc… and because she was feeling not good, she told him that she wanted to leave early and go home (that was the only moment she talked to him after the incident). 

you need to know that my sister had problem when she is not the center of the room and this prom was not about her, it was about him and his friend and because she didn’t know anyone, she had to make a scene to be the center of attention. this is why everyone is mad. 

my thing is, i was really mad that she was trying to make my friend looked like a c*w*rd. he was nothing but a c*w*rd. he was the sweetest boy ever. also he was his only prom in the US, and i’m sad he didn’t get to experience it fully. the way he invited her and how he tried to make her happy by matching their outfit was really adorable. 

now i’m wondering, was i the asshole for not taking her side and being on my friend’s side?

So I 25F live with my partner 31M and have been living together for 2 years he has kids from his previous relationship as for me I have none. His oldest son was culminating from elementary school and his child personally invited me to his culmination and he let me know he asked his mom first if he could invite me. I of course was like okay I’ll go as I have a good relationship with his children whom all are under the age of 12. When it is my partners days to keep them I do all the cooking cleaning washing their clothes taking care of them when they’re sick ect (he pays the rent and household bills) I pay my personal bills like phone car insurance ect. So of course when he invited me I was going to go. However my partner heard me say yes and later in private told me he did not want me to go. As he did not want to make the mother of his children feel some type of way. Yet there have been times when she can’t take them to an appt and I have had to take them and she knows and has let the dentist office know it’s no secret that I am very involved in their lives. So my feeling we’re hurt when he told me this. Fast forward a couple of days it was the day of the culmination and I went to work. My partner went to the culmination with his mom(my mother in law) the kids grandmas. After the culmination they all then went out to eat my mother in law  my partner his ex and all the kids, this is what really set me over the edge okay I get going to your child’s culmination but I felt as they did not all need to go out together. Her and do not have any time of relationship and in the past she has still tried getting at him and has talked shit about me and has called me out of his name yet I never have for the sake of the children. So them all going out and acting like one happy family really set me off. He could’ve simply waited and we could  have taken the kids out later. He really made me feel as if I’m just a side piece even tho we live together and when his children are with us I do all the household work and help him with everything. When in my opinion we are a family of our own of course I know they are not my children but I take care of them as if they were. So this last days I’ve really felt upset am I wrong for this ?

My dad is financially unstable and doesn't really scold us and take part in taking care of the family, so my mum is the man in the relationship. I always try to help ease my mum's burden by taking over, taking care of my siblings. The thing about my brother, he is always mentally unstable starting last year. I'm not sure if it is because he hated his life so much, he failed miserably his national exam, and not pursuing his studies like other kids. That's not a reason though, there are still courses he can take up, but he seem unbothered with his future and we're so tired about caring for him when he doesn't even care. We are currently on vacation, he had a small fight with my mum which is a very stupid fight, my mum got pissed off with him and nagged him but that's it. He has this thing of stonewalling all family members when he's angry, but yesterday was too much. It's so annoying we're on a family vacation together, taking trains and etc. but he wants to walk alone, which is fine until it's not.

41,1d1a87v,AITA for charging my adult brother $500 rent for two months?,"
My brother recently moved out of my mother’s house after they got into an argument for reference he’s about 26 years old. He left on bad terms and moved in with his girlfriend who had a house nearby.  Turns out that her house wasn’t hers and she was living with a friend who allowed her to let him move in. So after about a month there he is kicked out along with his girlfriend who now has to leave to move back in with her parents. The reason he said he was kicked out was because although his rent has virtually free he refused to clean up after the owners pet, an elderly dog. So with nowhere to go I open my doors to him for two months where I charge him $500 a month to stay with us. He ended up paying only for a month as our mother paid me for the second month. 

Truthfully my wife thought he should pay more since he is an able bodied grown man but I vouched for him and that was the price. During his stay my father was coming into town to visit us as we live across the country. My wife had a great idea to take my father to Disney World and I warned her that by extension my brother would need to go as my father wouldn’t like him to miss out. We agreed to have my brother to come along but I made sure I was clear with him that he help us pay for the trip. We asked him that in two months time he pay us $1,000 which is 1/10th of the total cost. The trip happened during his stay and now he has moved out after asking our mother for forgiveness so she would co-sign an apartment with him. I asked him a couple days ago if he was aware that the money was due to which he told me there was no way he’d be able to pay me back. 

After me sending a couple text messages and being ghosted I sent him a text suggesting perhaps we should just sell a guitar he left in our garage. I was promptly called and got sworn at for being a “dickhead” and told “fuck you”. I was told I did nothing for him and now that he’s moved out he’s had time to think about how by asking for rent we took advantage of him and that my wife and I are greedy. I’ve been told to sell the guitar and to leave him alone. Also his girlfriend moved in with him with 10k in savings which he refuses to ask for because he’s the “man”.

42,1d19zhp,WIBTA if I turn my mom in for fraud?,"WIBTA if I turned my mom in for taking student loans out in my name and hid the evidence for years?

Context:

When I was graduating from high school I went to a college fair at my local community college and I signed up to win a raffle. It turned out that it was for the Art Institutes and they started sending letters to my house and my mom pressured me into applying. I got in but it was so expensive I said I didn’t want to go because I couldn’t imagine going into that much debt to go to art school. I refused to even pack my things and I knew that I was not going to have success going. 

At the time I was an undiagnosed autistic 18 year old and even undiagnosed my mom knew I couldn’t take care of myself and attempted to get me on SSI for what she thought was bipolar, even hiring a lawyer when the claim was denied. Her reasoning is because I have a hard time talking to people when I’m “flipping out” or other people are rude to me. But if I’m being honest I also struggle with daily tasks and nonverbal communication.

Well I was told that I would 1) not have to pay for anything because my mom would and 2) if I didn’t go I would be homeless. So less than a month out of high school I was in student housing attending classes. 

I know I signed all kinds of paperwork for the school but I don’t recall ever signing anything for loans. It’s entirely possible that I did though because I was being given paperwork by my mom and at the time I was convinced that I was crazy and she had my best interest at heart. I was also only 17 and 18.

I was unable to complete the program (no surprise being that I had no support four hours away from family and having the worst college experience imaginable).

So fast forward several years and I see an open letter on my mom’s counter with my name on the envelope, it was from a student loan saying I owed $15,000. I tried to confront her but she refuses to answer any questions, she won’t even tell me how many loans she took out and for what amounts nor give me any account information.
I have gone no contact with her since for reasons unrelated.

 I don’t know what to do because if I turn her in I run the risk of losing my family, but I also kind of want justice somewhere for how she has treated me and she is going to ruin my financial future.
I have tried to do a change of address through USPS and I have never received any mail being rerouted from her address. 

The only thing I can think of doing is getting a lawyer but I don’t want to ruin my mom’s life even if I am done with her, I don’t wish her wrongdoing.

Edit: I checked the dates and they were for after I already started attending, so I was four hours away and couldn’t have signed the paperwork. 

The last time I asked my mother I was told I have four loans out by my mom two for a little under 3k one for 7k and one for 19k. 

I have only found two of them on credit Karma that she stopped paying as of a few months ago, and I’m getting it taken care of. I tried going to the student aid government site (thank you for telling me about that) and it said it was down, so I’m going to check back later.

Thank you for the suggestions, I’m going to contact the companies that I owe money to (apparently the schools are shutting down?) and hopefully get some kind of resolution and if not I’ll get a lawyer.

I understand that I went to the school, however I didn’t feel that I had a choice in the matter and I absolutely wouldn’t have gone if I knew I would have been financially responsible for it.

43,1d19n4g,AITA for not answering my parent’s calls?,"I am currently a junior in college and I am 21. My major is extremely busy. My time at college is comprised of multiple all nighters and long hours of studying and projects. I am also pressured to maintain a high GPA since a scholarship is paying for more than half of my college tuition, but to keep it I have to maintain an extremely high gpa. I also have some pretty bad focus issues. I have ADHD so it definitely makes my academics a lot harder. 

This week is finals week and it is extremely busy. I have been pulling consecutive all-nighters and have a lot of projects and tests due soon. My parents have been calling me repeatedly. I didn’t see because I left my phone on silent so I could pay attention to my work, but once I saw the multiple calls I called back. When I answered the phone they were passive aggressively like “whoaaaa look who decided to call? Do you even care about us anymore”. I apologized and said I was extremely busy with finals. I warned them that calls with me would be pretty infrequent because of how busy I was. They also have a tendency to call me during class even though I have repeatedly told them my schedule. Still they don’t listen yet they still get mad at me that I don’t answer right away. 

After I explained my finals situation they asked if I was stressed. I said yes extremely so, my grades depend on how well I do in finals and maintaining focus is extremely hard for me. They told me over the phone that I’m lucky to even be in uni so I shouldn’t complain about the stress (but they asked?) also they basically told me that their jobs are more stressful so I shouldn’t be such a baby. I always get insulted to a certain degree during these calls so I kind of dread them, but I still call. I kind of wish that they’d just appreciate what I do and acknowledge that I’m a hard worker and I do a lot. This morning while I was taking a break to eat, my mom called me. I let it go to voicemail because I was currently in the loud dining hall so I wouldn’t be able to  hear her through the phone anyway, but I had the intention to call back. She left me a voicemail that I read (my phone puts voicemails in text form). My mom basically said that her and my dad are making a new rule that if I don’t answer their phone calls in a timely manner they will stop paying for the phone bill and they will take away my phone. I am currently in a situation where I cannot pay for this, I can’t work while I’m in college since I’m so busy, I can only work during summer and winter break. She also said they would take away my phone if I continued this behavior yet I would still have to pay the phone bill. I am an adult and I just wish they would treat me like one sometimes without trying to punish me like I’m a teenager.

I am currently in a situation where I cannot pay for this, I can’t work while I’m in college since I’m so busy, I can only work during summer and winter break. She also said they would take away my phone if I continued this behavior yet I would still have to pay the phone bill. I am an adult and I just wish they would treat me like one sometimes without trying to punish me like I’m a teenager.

44,1d19n11,AITA for not wearing the cosplay costume my husband made me?,"Ok a little background first. I (26F) is married to Eric (26M) for 2 years now. We met at a comic-con type event and immediately hit it off. We both share our love towards cosplay, video games and a lot more.

I was into cosplay since I was a kid. In college I found some like minded friends, and we were hitting many comic conventions with our awesome costumes. 

But I was never a good designer nor a seamstress. It was always buy something that I like and do little mods and add accessories kinda deal. But I enjoyed it a lot.

It was during this time I met Eric, and oh golly he’s a master designer and he's good with electronic stuff too! He makes these really awesome costumes with lights and stuff that is on another level when compared with what I do. ( his proudest achievement is an iron man costume with a light-up arc reactor, eyes and palm rockets which is a sight to behold at night )

Anyway after we met he made costumes for me also, and we hit conventions like it’s no ones business.

Ok coming to the problem now. My college friends invited me to a convention a month ago, and I said yes. I decided to go as starlight (the boys). I did not mention this explicitly to Eric.

Today Eric surprised me with an ongoing project of ours. We were on our way making a Malenia costume (elden ring) for me, for a convention that’s later this year. Eric had finished the costume early to surprise me for the convention next week. Mind you, this is a very complicated piece to put on and it has some electrical plugs too while putting it on which I'm not too comfortable doing alone.

I said already decided on going as starlight, and he asked to show the costume, so I showed the one-piece starlight costume I got for this event.

He said it was a typical slutty hot girl costume, and I said maybe I want to be a slutty hot girl with my friends, and not be completely out of place at a not-too-fancy convention with a fancy sophisticated costume. I just wanted to be simple and just feel sexy in my hometown with my old friends.

I could see that he was very hurt by my remark, and I said I can still wear to the original convention according to our plan anyways. He said still I should have mentioned about my costume earlier, so he could not have rushed the Malenia costume. Then I told him that he should have asked me first and that it’s not his responsibility to make me costumes for everything.

He had to leave for work, so this is where we stand now. Sorry for the long rant, I’m typing this all to calm down my nerves a bit because we never had a argument of this magnitude before. AITA here?

PS - I read this all again, and I want to clarify that when he said ‘slutty’ it was not disrespectful. We review a lot of costumes on our free time, and we give them a ‘slutty-ness’ ranking out of 10 amongst other scores. I have worn 10/10 slutty-ness costumes with and without him before and it’s not an issue. It’s just that he thinks the store made ones are too generic.

When it 1st happened, I dealt with medical communications. Negative things happened between he and I, so he's been handling it (not very well.)

We're still on good terms, so we have convos about his health and the issues he's dealing with trying to get medical treatment. Just listening to him, *I'm* frustrated and pissed with his treatment (or lack thereof, I should say). I've asked multiple times over the past 8 months if I could help him. He continues to say no, he can do it. I've respected that.

However, in these past 2 months his health has drastically declined. He's suffering, overwhelmed, and borderline giving up. We have a 2yo child together who utterly adores hubby. I'm deeply concerned that if this decline continues, he will no longer be around for our child. 

I told hubs I will take over communications to get the ball rolling. He got frustrated with me and says I'm treating him like a child and he's capable. (He has no patience when it comes to handling important business and communication with staff goes south quickly.) He says its AH-ish of me to overstep his wants.

I've spoken with his dad and my mother about the situation. My mom agrees with hubs and his dad agrees with me. I need outside judgment, WIBTA?

EDIT: I have legal documents signed by my husband allowing me to communicate with and receive info from his providers. They have copies, as do I, and I'm also in their systems as a person medical info can be discussed with.

EDIT 2: I took the advice given and had a serious conversation with hubby, laid out all my concerns and how I wanted to assist. I apologized for my approach and intentions to overstep, explained the reasoning behind it. I even showed him the comments on here. I could see the shift in his eyes as he listened and *heard* me. 

He admitted he was scared of becoming a burden to me, especially since he's always been the type to be ""superman"" and he too apologized for being stubborn. He then *asked* me to help him.

They called her their miracle baby as long as I can remember and used to pick fights with family members because Abbi got away with everything when she was little (still does) and extended family were pissed when she would steal toys off cousins or take everything she wanted without thinking of others. This happened everywhere. At grandparents house, in public, at home and our parents were furious when family members would step in to correct Abbi. They'd also correct her for taking stuff from me and my parents would always tell family I didn't care.

Then when Abbi was 5 she got really sick with the flu which turned into pneumonia and she was in the hospital for weeks. My parents were worse after that. She *had* to be the priority, her happiness was everything, and that ruined my life completely. They would agree to let me do stuff with friends and then make me cancel or would just tell me I couldn't go and wouldn't let me cancel so I could play with Abbi because she wanted to play with me. One time my friends parents had paid for me to join them at the amusement park and my parents told them as the others showed up at our door. It was so embarrassing. 

Abbi and I would fight a lot. She'd tell me I had to hang out with her and I'd say I didn't want to. Then my parents would say Abbi was right and I had to. When she had other kids to hang out with I'd catch a break but when she wasn't allowed to play with them anymore or when they'd fight, she'd demand me.

My parents were also those parents to send Abbi with me to parties if she had no other plans and when parents were like no way in advance, my parents would only let me go if Abbi had plans.

2 years ago Abbi stole from one of my friends while he was at our house. My parents defended her and refused to make her return it. So his parents stopped us from being friends.

My parents made her impossible to be around and I wish I never had to see her again. We can't even see extended family now because my parents pissed them off so bad over Abbi.

My parents are now pissed at me because the camp they're sending Abbi and me to this summer is separating us and they wanted me to ask for them to keep us together. The camp ignored my parents so they expected me to do it for them. But I refused and they told me I should think of my sister and how lost she'll be especially for her first year at this camp.

51,1d18lpd,AITA for uninviting my brother’s “friend” from my wedding since they’re not a couple?,"My brother is very private, 21 years old. Two years ago, this friend of his suddenly became a significant part of his life. They live together for a lot of the year, my brother always talks about him when they’re not together, and his friend is always hanging around for the rest of the year when he’s living with our parents, even though he lives pretty far away. Everyone thinks they’re a couple. My mum asked me about it, after my sister had mentioned it to her, and I'd already assumed. My brother hasn’t had many girlfriends, and his friend seems gay. To me, the ultimate “proof” was that his phone’s wallpaper used to be a pic of them together, and when my mum asked about where they were in it, he acted cagey and changed it. They're very affectionate and my brother acts like a different person with him. 

Our parents include his friend like they do my fiancée and our younger sister's boyfriend. Mum is worried that he hasn’t come out because he feels unaccepted, so she's made an effort to be inclusive. I personally don't believe they're together anymore after my brother told me a story about a bad date he went on. I like his friend and I think he’s nice, but he’s a lot. He’s always shown up every time he’s invited, and he’s loud and chatty. I know he wouldn’t mix well with my fiancée’s more traditional family based on his personality. Her parents are paying for the wedding too. We've invited family only, with partners counting, and we invited my brother and his friend together under the impression that the friend counted under “partner.” It’s very feasible for us to rescind our invitation to him so we did, I just told my brother it’s not fair to other guests that can’t just grab a mate and bring them too. His friend doesn’t work so it’s not like we imposed. My brother asked why I couldn’t just make an exception for him, and I said that wasn't fair. He asked if teenagers dating count as ""partners"" (because my sister's boyfriend is invited) and he told me to ""just admit I don't like"" his friend, which isn't true. I made the mistake of saying that he wouldn't have had a good time with my fiancée's family anyway, which made my brother say we have ulterior motives to uninviting him (again, not true).

I get friendships are important and I don’t mean to devalue that, but we’re not having friends as plus-ones and my fiancée and I don't feel like we’re losing anything by not having him. My fiancée even says it's a relief because of her family. But I do feel bad for my brother, and I feel like this is casting a shadow over things when I do ultimately like his friend. My mum and sister have been treating me like I’m the devil for this because they believe they’re in a relationship and I’m being unfair to him, too. I’d feel less bad if I didn’t invite him at all, but the more I think about it, going out of my way to rescind the invitation seems like a shitty thing to do.

They're very affectionate and my brother acts like a different person with him. 

Our parents include his friend like they do my fiancée and our younger sister's boyfriend. Mum is worried that he hasn’t come out because he feels unaccepted, so she's made an effort to be inclusive. I personally don't believe they're together anymore after my brother told me a story about a bad date he went on. I like his friend and I think he’s nice, but he’s a lot. He’s always shown up every time he’s invited, and he’s loud and chatty. I know he wouldn’t mix well with my fiancée’s more traditional family based on his personality. Her parents are paying for the wedding too. We've invited family only, with partners counting, and we invited my brother and his friend together under the impression that the friend counted under “partner.” It’s very feasible for us to rescind our invitation to him so we did, I just told my brother it’s not fair to other guests that can’t just grab a mate and bring them too. His friend doesn’t work so it’s not like we imposed. My brother asked why I couldn’t just make an exception for him, and I said that wasn't fair. He asked if teenagers dating count as ""partners"" (because my sister's boyfriend is invited) and he told me to ""just admit I don't like"" his friend, which isn't true. I made the mistake of saying that he wouldn't have had a good time with my fiancée's family anyway, which made my brother say we have ulterior motives to uninviting him (again, not true).

I get friendships are important and I don’t mean to devalue that, but we’re not having friends as plus-ones and my fiancée and I don't feel like we’re losing anything by not having him. My fiancée even says it's a relief because of her family. But I do feel bad for my brother, and I feel like this is casting a shadow over things when I do ultimately like his friend. My mum and sister have been treating me like I’m the devil for this because they believe they’re in a relationship and I’m being unfair to him, too. I’d feel less bad if I didn’t invite him at all, but the more I think about it, going out of my way to rescind the invitation seems like a shitty thing to do. AITA?",1.0,1.0114444494247437,1,1
52,1d18k5y,AITA for asking my daughter to share her money ,"I have 4 daughters 29f 23f 16f and 15f

My oldest works a good job and does a side hustle so she makes really good moeny for her age.

My 23 year old chose not to go to collage She didn't want to have to do chores and other work at home. She moved out last year and we gave her 25,000 dollars which was her collage fund unfortunately rent costs a lot here so we have to help her out with food water,expenses pretty often The 25,000 was gone in a year.

We have to spend lots of money on her so she can afford her life as she doesn't really want to work. My husband isn't able to work much anymore due to health issues with my income alone I can no longer afford to support my 23 year old with my salary. My oldest daughter lives in a pretty rich state and makes quite over 100,000 per year although she lives in a pretty hcol area.

This is more than what I make so I asked my oldest if she could give some money to support her sister she doesn't want to as it'll be expensive and she wants to save on a house but I really want her to as it'll help her sister a lot my older daughter told me to ""tell my youngest to work and not freeload off everyone else"" I told her she was being selfish and asked her to pay atleast 2000 per year and I'd ask my 23 year old to get a part time job she still refused. I think it's selfish of her to put buying a house over helping her sister. She says she'll be willing to help her sister look for a job and to give her 500 a month not anymore than that.

I did ask for my daughter to get a part time job but she doesn't want to.

Now my oldest is upset I'm trying to use her and that I'm spoiling my 23 year old because she had to work and go to college but I told her I changed my parenting style.

53,1d18jxa,WIBTA if I don't go to my niece's graduation party? ,"Ok, so I need help here.  I(41f) have a niece that just graduated high school and her graduation party is tonight.  My mom called me a little while ago and asked of I was going. I'm really inclined to say no, but I know it will upset my mom. 

For some context, my brother has 4 daughters with his wife and they do all sorts of things with my SIL's family quite frequently, which means my mom often feels left out. My SIL has a large family and they do almost everything together,  she and her sister are inseparable and do everything together.  Even my niece's graduation party us combined with SIL's sister's kid and held at their house.  

All 4 of my niece's are involved in different activities, sports, dance, theater etc. and my mom often gets upset because she doesn't always know when my niece's have something going on. 

For the graduation party, formal invitations were sent out. I wasn't sent one, my brother added my name to the one that was sent to my mom and step-dad. He told my mom it was because he didn't have my address,  but he never contacted me to get it either and he has my number, so does my niece.
 
I get the distinct impression every time I'm at anything to do with my brother and his family, they don't want me around.  My brother and I have a tense relationship to begin with and are cordial with each other and that is about it. I also cannot stand his wife, and though I haven't told my brother that and has never said anything, I get the feeling it's mutual. My brother also tends to be a bully and make nasty, snide comments about appearance, vehicle, what I do for work and many other things and then claim he's ""just joking"" when I get upset. 

For the sake of my mental health, I have slowly been withdrawing myself from many events I know my brother and his family will be at. I do go to holidays at my mom's, but I only went to a couple of my nieces' events in the last year. My niece's are 18, 13, 12 and 6 and all except the 6 year old have phones and my number and could easily contact me if they wanted me to come to something.  None of them ever did. I haven't heard anything about the 18 year oldest graduation party except from my mom who mentioned it a couple times. My brother never reached out and neither did my niece. I feel as though I am not wanted and therefore don't want to go. My mom says that I should because of how often she gets upset at being excluded and my brother is trying to include us this time. I get her point, but I also feel like I'm not wanted and it just be another awkward afternoon if I went because other than my mom, no one really wants me there. I'm also extremely introverted and neurodivergent so I may have missed some social clues. I tend to do that.

54,1d17xif,"AITA for ""underdressing"" at a party?","A few days ago I (19 F)  was invited to a birthday party for my friends roomate (who ill call brandon) as a plus 1. I dont know the guy very well but I decided I'd go along anyway since it was my friend who invited me.

The day before, I went out with her to pick out some clothes for it. I eventually decided on a nice  crop top I found. I was told by my friend that it should be fine, and that I wouldn't be offending anyone by showing off a little skin, plus I thought it looked cute so why not?

Come the time of the party: at this point I arrive wearing the crop top that I picked out, and some shorts. I also had a hoodie tied around my waist incase we went outside for a fire later in the night. Most of the party was fine up until people started getting tipsy. The birthday boy in particular, had a few words to say about me. First it was little jabs at how I look, stuff that could be played off as playful banter... but then he started getting more aggressive with it as the night went on, eventually it got so bad  that I put on my hoodie to see if hed stop, but after he didn't I decided to leave. (I left quietly without a word). 

This morning I was woken up to this absolute essay of a text message from the guys girlfriend. The tl;dr was basically explaining how she was ""dissatisfied with the outcome of the party."" She continued to explain that me leaving prematurely without saying goodbye was rude, and that I had no right to arrive so ""underdressed"".  I tried replying to the message to explain my side of the story but she blocked me. 

I reached out to my friend asking if they are aware of any of this happening on their end and she told me that after I left, brandon went on a huge rant when he realized I was gone about my choice of clothes and that he made the claim that I was trying to ""come onto him"" which isnt true at all. She also said that she was the one who gave his girlfriend my number, but that she was told it was to ""comfort me about the situation"" part of me believes she misheard ""confront"" as ""comfort""

He got home around 9pm so there was no way to find anyone to come look/fix it. Naturally I got upset but not at him (my car is a 2010 so it’s not perfect) just at the situation my birthday is approaching and I had enough money for my half of the bills and literally $500 for my birthday I get paid biweekly and my next check goes to bills and my babies birthday. I’m 35 weeks pregnant with three kids at home, all I wanted to do was get my hair/nails done. I never do anything for myself, all my time and money goes to him and the kids. So I made a promise to myself that I would do something for me. Well Monday comes, I had to call off work because I’m the only one with the vehicle and also had to cancel my doctors appointment for that day.

57,1d17ixa,AITA for not letting my sister-in-law’s family stay with me after she gives birth?,"Using a throwaway account. My brother and his wife are expecting their first child this summer. My sister-in-law is from a different country and her first trimester was not easy and I know that she misses her family a lot. Her parents are planning to stay with them for a year when the baby is born (with a quick trip home in between so they don’t overstay their visa). She was thrilled that they could do this.

She recently asked if her sister and her sister’s family (husband and two children under the age of 6) could also come out with her parents and stay with me because they won’t all fit at their house. But she wants them to stay for 6 months. I asked if maybe they could do 2-3 weeks or even a month but she wasn’t happy about that at all because she really wants her sister to be here to help too. 

AITA for thinking that this is unreasonable and feeling imposed upon? Her family would not be able to drive and I live 30 minutes away from my brother and I work so I wouldn’t be able to drive them to see her every day and I don’t think my brother will have time to pick them up every day. 

Technically I have the space. But I like my quiet time and having four people that I’ve never met stay with me for six months feels overwhelming. They don’t speak English so it would also be a little awkward in the beginning, I think. The plan is to homeschool the older child while they’re here (the younger one isn’t school age yet). I don’t fully understand the husband’s job but apparently he’s able to do it remotely. That would mean he’s on calls and video meetings in the middle of the night though.

 I understand that it’s hard to have a baby so far from your family and I want to be supportive of my sister in law. I’ve been firm in my stance that  a 6 month visit is too long but she’s pretty upset with me and her and my brother haven’t been speaking to me for a couple of weeks now so I’m wondering if I’m just being cruel or selfish here.

EDIT: thank you so much everyone for your comments and for helping me to feel much better that I was not being unreasonable. I’m reading through all the comments but wanted to reply to a few ideas that many had shared.

1) My brother and SIL cannot afford a short-term rental, nor can her family. But beyond that, in her culture, it would be considered rude to put them up somewhere else if family can accommodate them. I believe they briefly looked at AirBNBs and short-term rentals but in addition to the expense, her family’s lack of permanent status for that long of a stay might have been a concern for some (not sure of exact details or convos and maybe they just told me that to make it seem like they had no other option) but bottom line, they can’t afford it

2) Thank you to all who pointed out some of the potential legal issues with the husband working remotely here on a tourist visa, and the sticky situations that could come out of being here for so long. I had not considered that and I really appreciate the advice 

3) If she were to go back to her home country with the baby instead of everyone coming here, my brother could only stay for a few weeks. And ironically, her family doesn’t have room for them to stay with them

I’ve been firm in my stance that  a 6 month visit is too long but she’s pretty upset with me and her and my brother haven’t been speaking to me for a couple of weeks now so I’m wondering if I’m just being cruel or selfish here.

EDIT: thank you so much everyone for your comments and for helping me to feel much better that I was not being unreasonable. I’m reading through all the comments but wanted to reply to a few ideas that many had shared.

1) My brother and SIL cannot afford a short-term rental, nor can her family. But beyond that, in her culture, it would be considered rude to put them up somewhere else if family can accommodate them. I believe they briefly looked at AirBNBs and short-term rentals but in addition to the expense, her family’s lack of permanent status for that long of a stay might have been a concern for some (not sure of exact details or convos and maybe they just told me that to make it seem like they had no other option) but bottom line, they can’t afford it

2) Thank you to all who pointed out some of the potential legal issues with the husband working remotely here on a tourist visa, and the sticky situations that could come out of being here for so long. I had not considered that and I really appreciate the advice 

3) If she were to go back to her home country with the baby instead of everyone coming here, my brother could only stay for a few weeks. And ironically, her family doesn’t have room for them to stay with them

58,1d17flt,WIBTA for going to a game night at my place that my partner isn't invited to?,"Hello reddit. 

I am currently working abroad through a government program where I have colleagues from all around the world that have come here to work. I have been friends with and worked alongside a group of people the whole year I've been here, including my roommate. My roommate and some others from the group have put together a game night where everyone must be in even pairs for it to work. They asked to have it at my apartment and my roommate and I have agreed. 

My partner is from the city we are living in and we have been together for 3 months although we have been friends since I got here as well. He has hungout with some of the people in the group various times throughout the year but not regularly by any means because he's had to work. 

Anyways, the teams were made, my partner has not been included because it's an uneven number if he comes and everyone else is in the program. I have asked if we can add someone else to the roster to make it even so he can come and we tried to ask some other folks and they said they could not make it. At this point they have agreed they'd rather keep it as it is even though I've told them I don't feel comfortable with hosting it and leaving him out. WIBTA if I attend game night as it's the last night with my colleagues before they move away? I am staying here with my partner after they leave.

59,1d178fs,AITA for making my moms bf give me money for rent/bills/etc?,"
For context: I (25 F) moved back home almost 2 years ago to help my mom. She is a single mom and was having a hard time keeping up with bills. 

I just graduated with my masters and have been working full time while going to school full time during undergrad and during my masters program. I would still contribute as much as i could while trying to make sure i had enough money for my own rent/bills/etc.

The beginning of January  - she had met this man who i personally have an unsettling feeling about. Without any warning, i notice that he is here every single night. 

Fast forward to end of Feburary - he is basically living here and acts as if this is his own. Yet he doesnt pick up after himself, basically has my mom attending to him, etc. Its pathetic. So i say something to her...

the response she gave me: ""its my house and i own this so i make the rules""

After 3 months (March).... i told him he needs to send atleast $2,000. He gave me it. Now he is asking when ill pay him back. I only asked because it was not fair to me that i moved back home to specifically help my mom out - only to be taking care of some random man living in my home.

He ran up the water bill to about $1,000, the mortgage that i pay half for is a total of $1,600, gas has sky rocketed because he is using the washer and dryer 3x a day.... and electric is just unreal..and dont get me on the groceries.... he eats all that i buy and leaves none for me. 

(i also just started my big girl job and i am starting to make a bit more cash now... which my mother is taking advantage of).

In my head im thinking ""is this guy homeless?""

After doing some digging - he is in a court battle with his 2nd ex wife and she is living in their home rent free while he pays for it.

That is not my problem. He is not my father and to be quite frank i am extremely uncomfortable around him. But my mom doesnt care to hear any of my concerns. 

to add to this nightmare.... while i was gone on a work trip, i came back to his car being gone (he sold it) and things moved around in my car.... with an empty tank of gas (it was filled up completely before i had left). 

I had asked him if he used my car and if so , he needs to ask before hand and atleast replace the gas he used. No answer. 

My mom then texts me separately telling me i can fill it up myself and she will not allow him send money to replace the gas he used because ""he's a man you should be ashamed that you even asked.""

The cherry on top is.... i just found out that he recently quit his job and is unemployed.

60,1d170ru,AITA for stopping talking to my friend when she said I was bad for her?,"I (23) stopped talking to my friend Jane when she texted me that I was bad for her.

She and I met when we started college. Her friends were the ones who started talking to me and I joined her group of friends after several meetings and outings.

Jane is bisexual and once one of our friends mentioned to me the possibility that she might like me. I didn't know what to say. I am straight and figured that if Jane confessed her feelings to me she must be sincere, but she never said anything of the sort so I assumed it was a misunderstanding on our friend's part.

Over the next few years I felt more that we had a strong friendship and knew each other well. She would talk to me about her relationships that didn't always end well and ask me for advice. I also had a partner who cheated on me and Jane was there to listen and comfort me.

I thought we were good friends. I really believed it. But this year she started acting distant and strange. At first I thought it was normal since both of our jobs keep us both very busy. I would still try to communicate when I could to see how her week was going, although she was very curt.

One day she invited me to a coffee shop, since we had some free time. I tried to chat with her as usual, but she seemed really distant and cold. After that we said goodbye and went to our homes. When we arrived I saw a message from her saying that lately she was getting out of her life what was bad for her and that today she knew that I was one of those people she needed to get away from. It was not good for her and she needed to cut off contact with me.

I didn't understand the action, but she knows me. If that was what she wanted I would give it to her. I apologized and told her I would give her her space.

From there I never communicated with her again. Our friends notice that we were no longer talking to each other in group chats and have asked me if something happened. I don't feel I have an obligation to explain what happened, because it was Jane's decision, so I have some people all over me constantly asking me about Jane and what happened.

I don't know if I did wrong, but we're not kids anymore. If Jane wants me out of her life for whatever reason, I will walk away.

To a point that I no longer believe what he tells me, even when it's something apparently seriously, until he presents me with evidence.

He had appeared to of stopped lying when he did eventually have 2 legitimate children, so for 3 years he had slowly started to earn back my trust as he stopped with all the wild claims. However, October last year he claimed to have had a heart attack, I was sceptical but went along with it at first. His lie soon fell apart when his girlfriend said she didn't believe him either. Apparently the ambulance came out, confirmed he had a heart attack, but that he didn't need to go hospital? Bollocks. If you have a heart attack, you obviously need to go hospital. It's important to note that we are only 26, it's not normal to have hearts attacks at this age, and you certainly would have to go hospital if you did!

Anyway, flash forward to the early hours of this morning, and he calls me up in a panic claiming he's having black outs, pissing blood and more. My reaction was ""Okay whatever"" and hung up.

This evening he has sent me a few stroppy messages about how we're supposed to be best friends and there for eachover but I abandoned him when he needed me the most.

We agreed that we'd both like to move in together around September of this year. He told me that he'd be looking at apartments with just his kids and use them to make his final decision for where we'd move. Understood that his children will be his first priority, but I had consulted with him a couple of days later stating that I'd like to be apart of the conversation in where we live too, as it'd be mainly me and him since his kids live with their mother and visit once a week on Sundays.

On Wednesday, we made plans for me to spend a couple of days at his place like I typically do every other week. Yesterday being the day that I would come over from work, he asked me to come to his job first because he wanted to see me. I was confused, but obliged. Afterwards, he asked me to follow him from his job and I did. As we drive, we pull into an apartment complex I've never seen before and ask him why we're here. He proceeds to tell me that this is where he's chosen to live with the help of his kids. I'm taken aback, seeing that we're supposed to be moving in together in September.

I ask him why I wasn't asked or even consulted, seeing that he now has a new place that I'm expected to live in without so much as even knowing that his lease was up earlier than he let on. He then reiterates that I already knew he was going to let his kids be the decision makers and that it isn't a big deal? I get upset and we start arguing about how I should've had a say because we're still supposed to make sure we're both comfortable in a place that me, him and his kids are ok with.

You can look up the original phrasing below. The occurance of remains unchanged, I mostly just added details that were asked for.

My (f26) partner (m25) got invited to a colleague's wedding and I was his +1. He asked me if I'd really want to come since I didn't know anyone there and I have social anxiety issues. But I wanted to join him because I like weddings and I was happy he finally involved me in work-related stuff which he usually prefers to keep seperated from his private life.

We went there, I was introduced briefly to some of my partner's colleagues who were there aswell and after dinner, he engaged in a conversation with them. I attempted but failed to join in and didn't really know what to do since I felt left out. My phone had died in the meantime. I wandered off and to the deserted children's corner where there was a stack of selfmade (someone had printed out random wedding-themed cliparts, folded and stapled them into a book), pocket-size coloring books and pencils. I took one and some pencils and went back to my place at the almost empty table.

I was coloring a bouquet of flowers when my partner told me that I was embarassing him in front of his colleagues and that I should stop. I should come dance with them instead. The dance was one of these group dances where you have close physical contact with a lot of people and I hated the music, so I declined and kept drawing.

2 coloring book pages later, they (my partner and his colleagues) had vanished and when they didn't come back, I went outside to look for my partner but he was nowhere near the venue and it was too cold outside for me too go any further. It was freezing. My jacket, phone charger, powerbank, keys and wallet were inside the car and he had the key. So I was stuck inside the venue, where I knew nobody. At 1 A.M. I had finished coloring the entire book and he was still gone. Everyone else was drunk and behaving strange and the music had gotten better. I wanted to blend in, pretended to be drunk aswell and entered the empty dancefloor, mindlessly spinning around until I felt dizzy to ease the anger I felt.

When he came back, he was angry with me for behaving so childish and embarrassing him in front of his colleagues and everyone else for the entire evening.

He usually wants to keep work stuff and private stuff separated and apparently, this wedding counted as work stuff for him so he didn't really want me there, which I was made aware of during the first group conversation at the reception. I came to support him and in the end acted childish and complained about being neglected, but he just left me in a place filled with strangers, knowing about my neurodivergent struggles (which I don't want to use as an excuse, I think it still helps to explain the situation) and without telling me that he was leaving and where to, so AITA?

65,1d169mi,AITA for telling my girlfriend that she needs to face her anxiety?,"Basically I just had an argument this morning with my girlfriend. We are (were) planning to go to a wedding event out of town on Friday, but realized that pride would be happening where we live on Saturday and Sunday. We were trying to navigate ways to be able to attend both things, and the options were to leave town Thursday night and head back early Friday morning (6 hour drive each way), or to just fly (about an hour each way) for the convenience. My girlfriend has flight anxiety, but she has flown multiple times before. However, her anxiety has been higher lately so she said she doesn’t know what she would prefer to do since driving would be inconvenient but flying frightens her. I told her that I kind of need an answer as soon as possible, because if we end up flying, the prices will go up the longer we wait. She got mad at me and said I’m not being considerate of her anxiety, to which I told her that I’m sorry she’s feeling anxious and not trying to invalidate her, but her not giving an answer, nor a timeline for when she could answer, is being inconsiderate of my finances.

She said I am being very rude and hurtful by putting a timeline on her anxiety.

Basically I just had an argument this morning with my girlfriend. We are (were) planning to go to a wedding event out of town on Friday, but realized that pride would be happening where we live on Saturday and Sunday. We were trying to navigate ways to be able to attend both things, and the options were to leave town Thursday night and head back early Friday morning (6 hour drive each way), or to just fly (about an hour each way) for the convenience. My girlfriend has flight anxiety, but she has flown multiple times before. However, her anxiety has been higher lately so she said she doesn’t know what she would prefer to do since driving would be inconvenient but flying frightens her. I told her that I kind of need an answer as soon as possible, because if we end up flying, the prices will go up the longer we wait. She got mad at me and said I’m not being considerate of her anxiety, to which I told her that I’m sorry she’s feeling anxious and not trying to invalidate her, but her not giving an answer, nor a timeline for when she could answer, is being inconsiderate of my finances.

66,1d15iz2,WIBTA if I went to a 6 day conference?,"I have a chance to go to this training at the end of June. It’s fully paid for by my union, some of it will have to be reimbursed later, but it's such a great opportunity for me and my career because I'll be able to teach a course on it when I'm done, and the union will hire me to teach it twice a year. This will give me experience teaching adults, which is good in case I do ever decide to leave child education, so it will help boost my resume for teaching and non-teaching jobs. And I would also get 40 CPDU's (credits I need to renew my teaching license, I need 120 every 5 years). The training is in DC, and I'll be gone 6 days. I have no idea when another opportunity like this will come up.

The problem? I have a newborn son who will be just under 5 months old during the conference. My husband is the one who works from home and takes care of him while I'm at work. Them coming on the trip would be complicated because we have pets so we'd have to get someone to watch them, we would have to make the 12 hour drive because we can't afford to buy 3 round trip plane tickets and only get reimbursed for 1, and my husband would have to work and take care of our son for 6 days in a hotel room.

Going to work and being a new mom again has honestly been rough on me. I have to get up early to feed him before work, and then I take over feeding as soon as I get home so that we can maintain our small milk supply. I pump during my planning period and right after work. And because the year is winding down the kids are a little hard to handle lately. So all of this has left me really tired when I get home. Some days I also have a headache so I need to lay down and my husband has to make dinner (something I usually do). I've been trying hard to take over with our newborn as soon as I get home, and I exclusively breastfeed and take care of him on the weekend, I've just had some bad days lately.

My husband thinks this is all bad timing. He doesn't want to have to be alone with our newborn for 6 days, and is worried that this training is going to add another things to my plate. He thinks I'm not spending enough time with our son, and points out that it's only going to get harder once he's moving around and doing more, so I shouldn't be taking on more responsibilities. Even though I am already giving up teaching summer school this year so I can stay home with the baby. He just thinks I'm putting too much of a burden on him and our son.

one of the irls would then text me a couple days later asking if i was serious. i told her i was like '30% serious and making a joke how i considered it but ultimately was not going to apply'. she then said that based on this politicians views, that she could no longer be friends with me and would not hang out with me.

i was pretty shocked and tried to inform her that while i respected her decision, a) this did not represent my own views b) i thought i was clearly joking even if insensitively. i also apologized.

70,1d14bvx,AITA for asking my BIL to stay at a hotel? ,"I've (34F) been married to my husband (34M) for 5 years, and we've been living in his parents' house since we got married. My in-laws, who have since passed away, left the house to both my husband and his brother (39M). However, his brother lives in a different state and only visits once a year. Since moving in, we've expanded and renovated the house, with his brother contributing a small amount.

The problem arises when his brother visits, as he stays for 2-3 weeks, which is much longer than just a weekend. This extended stay frustrates me because it feels like I have no privacy in my own home. I know he is well off and can afford a hotel but he never does so. 

This year, he made two trips: one at the beginning of the year and one this month, the last one lasting almost three weeks. I finally reached my limit and politely suggested that he book a hotel room for his next visit if it would be as long. This offended him since he still considers this his house too. He didn't confront my husband about it, but it seems he told one of their cousins, and now many family members I interact with daily are upset with me—something he doesn't have to deal with because he doesn't live here.

Something that destroyed her life not long after I was born. She was sick for years, her family didn't always recognize something was badly wrong, she lived a petty typical life until she got pregnant with me and then pregnancy hormones made her untreated mental illness so much worse. My parents were married and my dad sorta buried his head in the sand even as mom got worse. She left when I was 2. I saw her occasionally after that but she was never a big presence in my life. She was too sick to be. She was so far gone and her family tried to help her but she rejected help. She was hospitalized a few times but always ended up back where she began.

My dad ignored the warnings that I could inherit mental illness from mom. He decided I was perfect and we would be perfect. He moved on from the marriage and liked to pretend everything was fine. He married someone who was pretty awful about mental illness and she was hard for me to be around. I don't know where all her views came from but they meant mental illness was stigmatized in the household and it made it even easier for dad to ignore when I started showing signs. It was something I was told time after time not to bring up. Then he'd say mom was just a bad person and his wife would say I should be glad they weren't trying to turn me into a freak like my mom's family was, because they saw the signs and they tried speaking out too.

It freaked me out that I could get worse. Especially when teachers and people at school started to notice. In the end I turned 13 and found myself having multiple breakdowns a week because I could tell something wasn't right.

I have my own job and car, I do still have bills but for the most part, they are all covered by him. Except sometimes groceries.

I've made a post similar to this subject a while back and it's still eating at me. My mother is disabled, she has lupus so her getting around and doing things is not as easy as before she was diagnosed. I have a brother that still lives at home(19, will be 20 this year). 

Yesterday, I went out to Nashville with my boyfriend and his parents to see his cousin, who is in the hospital, for his 21st bday. On my way back, I call my brother since my mom wasn't picking up, tell him where I was at and that I just wanted to check on everyone/explained where I was the whole day, the phone is given to her, I hear my brother tell her where I was...and she gets mad at me, going on a whole rant, telling me that I need to start telling her where I'm going, how it feels like I'm just wanting to not tell her where I am???...and how I keep choosing his family over my own(keep in mind we barely see his family even more than once a week). 

She gets frustrated at me because I don't hang out with my brother often(he doesn't have too many friends), and she also goes on about how I never go up there to see her especially since we live in the same city....but I try to see her at least once every week.

75,1d13d6w,AITA: aita for being petty about my “step” brought,"
For context i invited let’s say Jason out with me and my friends as he had no friends. I was very nice and respectful towards him so as were my friends for as far as i know . However he has decided to start unnecessary drama towards my life. 

Firstly, at a family event i was not at Jason decided to tell my own mother that me and my friends were ‘ bitches’ towards him . Forcefully got him drunk etc . Not true as he barely even spoke to them and i have been nothing but nice to him and he had one drink . 

Secondly, he has now decided to tell let’s say Maddie that i said she hated him , Jason shouldn’t be friends or talk to him . NOT TRUE i only said that be careful because they were laughing at Jason’s hair, coat and skinny jeans …. So apparently i said they shouldn’t associated with each other when i do not even know this girl . 

Thirdly, Jason has told everyone we are step siblings we aren’t . For context our parents are not married and i would never class him as a siblings ever for all that he has said and because of his father . I think personally it’s weird to call us step siblings as we haven’t spoke since October, and barely even spoke before that . 

 Along with this ,Jason decided to show his father my social media to try and get me in trouble ? just weird why are you showing a middle age man my social media posts of me and my friends are you jealous ? 

So i have expressed this to my mother and she’s took his side i feel … As apparently i am a nasty petty  person for feeling this way towards him . I also want to confront him but i don’t know if i should or how to for making me feel like i’m in wrong ? AITA?

76,1d1311w,AITA for calling my dad a shitty father?,"All my (24F) life my dad has always been selfish and superficial. Around 7 my older brother moved in with my dad but refused to let me see him more often. I could only see him every other weekend. When we would have midweek visitation, he would pick me up from my mom’s and take me with him to run errands (aka Lowe’s, Home Depot, and Costco) then take me back to my mom’s. When I came home from school insecure about my body hair (was 8/9) he encouraged me to start shaving. He would tell me I looked homeless because he didn’t like the outfits I would choose to wear. (Clean clothes just mismatched cause I was a kid) He would tell me if I wasn’t “lady-like” and looking “presentable” at all times, it made him look bad and it would be embarrassing for him. Whenever he wanted something from me, he would start promising he would get me a puppy. He would take me to go look at puppies saying we will come back another time to buy one, but then after he got what he wanted he would “change his mind.” When I would see him every other weekend, he would usually take my brother and I to a babysitter 1 or 2 nights so he could hang with friends. When he got remarried (I was 11) he convinced me to move in full time with him and see my mom every other weekend. (I now know it was so he would pay less child support) He told my step mom to start encouraging and teaching me to do my hair/makeup. As I got more insecure, I began gaining a bit of weight as I used food to comfort my depression. My brother (3 yrs older)started calling me a “fat heifer” and when I’d cry and ask my dad to defend me, he would tell me to stop whining because “boys will be boys”. More stuff like that continued to happen as years went by. Fast forward to last year, I decided to confide in him about some trauma my older brother caused to me that he didn’t know about. At that point things seemed to be alright between us and he told me I could trust him. I found out 3 months ago, that not only did he tell my brother everything I told him, when I found out and said he broke my trust he said, “he deserved to know.” Then said I was the one breaking trust, and I was abandoning family and being selfish. He ended the convo with “Goodbye [insert name].” A month after that he reaches out to invite me to his church meeting and after I didn’t respond favorably given our last conversation, he started saying he was sorry for me that I still haven’t found peace. And that I’m still resentful of things from years ago. I expressed how he has never taken accountability and always blamed me for things he did and he ended it by saying he “wishes” me the best. That was the last straw and I finally told him he was a shitty father who brought me more pain than joy.

77,1d130so,AITA for not letting my best friend use my credit? ,"So for context my (27F) best friend, let’s call her Ari (29F) it’s always struggling financially because of her own bad decision, I love her to death but I can’t with how she handles her money and priorities. 

A year and a half ago I had very bad credit, paid a lot of debt and now I have a good credit that obviously I’m careful with (taking into consideration that I have a boyfriend who we are looking into getting married and have some joint finances so I’m also mindful on that). I also had a bad experience with an ex-best friend in the past, I signed the apartment for both of us, she left early and I was left with 2 months on the lease I couldn’t afford, so I also have my trauma with that.

Ari decided to move 2 years ago to an expensive city for the artsy life, she said she was going to get an extra job to recover but she didn’t and ended up just living life, which led to letting her car get repossessed (Nov 2023). Context for this, she had a car co signed by a friend, they got into an argument, friend forced her to get her name off the vehicle, Ari’s only option was to get a new used car that was $600 a month + insurance which it is a lot. 

When the struggle with the new car started and she was considering letting it get repossessed I tried finding solutions with her and advising her on the importance on credit, Ari said one time : “I was talking to X and what they said is true, credit can get fix is not like I’m looking to buy a house”. 

She doesn’t take advice well and she ended up letting the car get taken, making obviously the credit worse than what it was. Now with her saving $800 a month that she was spending in car and insurance she had plans to save but that never happened.

Fast forward to now :
She had an incident at her current apt that she was expecting some kind of discount on the rent, they didn’t and she asked what’s the soonest she can leave, they replied 3 weeks after with a date to move out and now Ari has to leave in 1 mo 1 week because of pettiness imo.

She wants to move to an apt complex that requires a decent credit for less deposit (6,500 and with good credit 3,500), she asked her mom to applied, moms credit is not the best, I get a msg from her asking me if I would co sign with her and with lots of explanations as to how she’s doing better but I immediately told her no and explained why. 

I know Ari very well and I’m sure she’s thinking badly of me and how can I’m not helping her when my situation is better than hers, she tends to think that people should bend over backward for some situations when everyone has their life, just because you made the decisions you did doesn’t mean I have to feel sorry and solved your life, I really do think she has a hard time with adulting. 

As much as I feel bad and wish I’d assist her with this, I can’t help but think about future outcomes, uncomfortable situations and just in general being tied up to something so serious, am I the asshole?

78,1d12ume,AITA for refusing to go to my mother's church even though they got me a graduation gift,"Fair warning: I have nothing against religion or having a relationship with God. I have a best friend who is Christian and we get along super great but the difference between what her and my mother believe is huge. 

Long story short: My mother dragged me to church from the time I was born until around when i turned 18 and decided that I wasn't going to go there. I have a bit of religious trauma from my mother and have talked to her about the multiple reasons I don't want to attend church at her church. 

Jumping to recently now: she told me about a week ago the church wanted to get me a gift for graduation. I told her something along the lines of ""well thats nice of them but I don't need anything and I won't be going to that church"" she acted like she has no recollection of me telling her all the reasons through the years of why I won't go to that church. She texted me this morning and is trying to convince me to come even though I have told her multiple times I won't come back. 

She texted me ""The church will have your graduation gift for you today.  Could you come to church at 11:00 to receive it?  It would make us all happy."" And I told her ""I told you I will not go"" she hasn't responded yet but I'll update if something more comes from this. 

So am I the asshole? What do you think? 🤔
of course there is way more that I could have prefaced this story with but then the post would be a novel so I'm just trying to stick with a little context and the basics of what happened recently. I definitely don't fit in at her church and haven't felt safe or welcomed in a decade. 

So yea, am I the asshole for refusing to go to receive a college graduation gift from the old church I haven't been to for a service in around 5 years?

Again! I am not going so don't worry about me going I'm not!

I have been in an on/off relationship with my partner for 10 years.  We have a 6yr old and he has an older kid from previous relationship. He had an extremely toxic relationship with her

He and I have gone through extremely hard times We had talked about children and when I got pregnant he changed. He constantly told me a trapped him, got pregnant on purpose, our son wasn't his. He's always been emotionally and mentally abusive. I wasn't good enough, I had to work to earn his love and attention be keeping the house clean etc. after our son was born I had very bad PPD. I tried to tell him something was wrong he told me to suck it up. I however got help or either myself and/or our son would have not made it. As a precaution we stayed where we would be safest with my family.

fast forward we've both gotten better and started working through things. He lives with his oldest and his grandmother who he takes care of.  I have worked really hard to earn back his trust after a few years of lieing to him about certain things. It got to the point where I just couldn't take it and would lie to avoid a fight or being verbally attacked. we have been working through our problems. I have been working hard to make him happy - cleaning his home, laundry, taking care of his grandma not easy to have to diaper another adult. But I do it for him. I even do paperwork for him for his job.  

At times he still tells me I'm not doing good enough. I have never cheated on him or even thought about it.  Today I got a notification an old friend who posted a video on TT. Once he saw he asked to see my messages. I told him no. This goes on back and forth until he accuses me of cheating.  I have been working very hard over the last few years to learn that I am in control of my own life, no one not even he can make me do something.  He told me to either show him or get out. I refused. I feel like I've worked hard enough that he should be able to trust me. At this point he started calling me a whore and a cunt which really pissed me off. I'm used to him calling me names when he's angry but when he tried to take my phone from me I got extremely angry. He told me to get out and he took our son and I home. He told me If I left we were over but he told me that if i didn't leave he'd call the cops.  He wouldn't even let me use the washroom unless I left my phone with our son.

phone. I feel like I should have given in to him and done what he wanted but I feel like if he really loved me he would have trusted me enough by now.

He says if I really loved him I would have let him have my phone.

81,1d12q5p,AITA for asking to set boundaries with my big brother?,"I (23 nb) have two brothers but my middle brother (29m) is the ""problem"". Also I'm very sorry if my English is kinda broke, I'm tired and sad and I mostly speak Spanish. 

So, a little background: my brother always had this complex for being the middle child, we all know what is that about, the difference is that my parents never treated him badly, they payed for everything while we all were on school and they worked their asses off, we traveled, we had modern cellphones, love, affection and attention. But sometimes i feel people outside managed to make him think that he wasn't wanted or loved, and now that he's older he acts like he was alone all this years. Maybe is something mental health related, I do have problems myself so is a valid point. 

The thing is that the past week he came to visit (he lives far away for work) and just came to eat, pretended that he's the king of the house even if he pay no shit, told rude stuff to my mom, fighted (verbally) with my grandparents and told me to be less useless.

My dad got mad and I got mad at my parents because if they settled boundaries a long time ago and stopped enabling his behavior, we wouldn't have this problem now, so I asked them and nothing has changed, because they seem reluctant to do it. Ok, days passed, house is tense, I'm the only one who's still mad and the rest is asking like nothing happened. 

Yesterday I snapped and put my foot down and told them (I screamed) that if this situation doesn't get better, I don't want him in the house anymore, so they're all now pissed at me because they think I don't like my brother anymore. I know they want peace, no problems, but I want peace too. I feel anxious and sad because I feel no one is listening. 

I don't want them to cut him off if they don't want to, I just want to be comfortable in my own house, I need to know that if he come to visit it doesn't mean walking on eggshells or listening to rude comments about everyone.

82,1d12jvv,WIBTA if I asked my exes sister to send me back something that belonged to my grandfather?,Long story short I (24F) broke up with my ex (27M) over year and half ago after 3 years of dating. It was a very painful breakup since we still loved each other but he has since moved on with the girl we used to fight about. We are not on speaking terms except annual happy birthday text. Now onto the issue. I left something that belonged to my grandfather that passed away when I was a child at his place in a different country than the one me and him are currently living in. Pretty early on after the breakup we talked about him sending ALL my things to me asap. After over half year later I gently reminded him he has my things and said that the only thing I care about getting back is that one thing of my grandfather’s. He apologised and told me he will send it around Christmas. That didn’t happen so I sent him another text 11 days ago (almost half year after the time I hoped he would send it) and he still hasn’t responded. I know his sister is at the place where my thing is quite often and she could easily take it and send it. I’m not in regular contact with her but we chat casually from time to time. The object isn’t of any significant value except sentimental and I do want to have it back since it wasn’t mine to give away in the first place.

83,1d11xl2,AITA for spending too much of my boyfriend’s vacation budget?,"My boyfriend and I (both in our early/mid-twenties) recently went on an international vacation together. Background context is that he comes from a wealthy family that fully supported him through college. Because of this he has a large amount of money saved. This is not my situation, I worked through college to support myself and I have no savings at all. We are now early in our careers, we make the same amount of money working full-time, and it’s not enough to save.

Several months ago my boyfriend suggested that we take an international vacation together. I told him I fully supported him going by himself or with other friends who can afford it, but I can’t afford it. He ended up insisting that he would cover me. He booked the flights and most of the accommodation out of his own pocket and his parents covered the remainder of our hotel stays. I didn’t contribute at all to this as we’d agreed. I felt a little uncomfortable with it but I’d never travelled abroad so I took the opportunity. 

On our first night, we went to an expensive restaurant of his choosing and we each got an entree, shared an appetizer and we each had a drink (a cocktail for me and a soda for him because he doesn’t drink). We then went out for ice cream and another drink later that night (also his idea). It was wonderful and we were both in good spirits the whole time.

The next morning, he became withdrawn and was looking at his phone. He told me that we were burning through the budget and I should “cool down on my spending” and should be paying for my own appetizers, drinks, desserts and other extras. I let him know that I was sorry if he misunderstood things but I can’t afford restaurant food in a tourist town. I told him that if I am supposed to be paying for those things myself then I just won’t order them anymore, which is ok with me (I was just happy to be there). Admittedly I was feeling a little defensive, and I pointed out that everything we ordered had been his suggestion and he never told me in the moment that it was too much. I said it felt like he was insinuating I was going crazy and burning through his money.

It became a big argument and he accused me of trying to make him feel shitty for not having enough money to make all my dreams come true, and for making it sound like he’s depriving me of fun extras during our vacation. I told him that that wasn’t my intention at all, but that we should’ve had a clearer conversation about budget before we took this trip (and I accepted responsibility for that too). He feels strongly that I made him feel bad for not being able to give me the world, basically. The entire day ended up being tense. 

AITA for responding that way? He thinks that I should’ve shown more gratitude and not gotten defensive. In hindsight I agree that since he’s paying for everything I should’ve maybe just said ok rather than arguing.

Edit to respond to some frequent comments: 
-Some people interpreted my description as my bf saying that he wants me to pay for ALL of my own food. This isn’t the case, he was saying he wanted me to pay for “extras” like dessert, drinks, appetizers.
-I did not bring $0 to this vacation. I have enough to pay for some activities and extras for myself, but just not at the places he was choosing bc they are very expensive.
-My issue was not with him asking for more of a contribution from me but with him blaming me for going over-budget and that was the reason for the argument.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-26,"AITA for spending too much of my boyfriend’s vacation budget?

84,1d117iv,AITA for walking out of the house and staying out for the whole day while family were visiting after my parents brought up my older sister's not adoption again?,"My parents are hosting extended family for a couple of weeks. It's my maternal and paternal grandparents as well as my aunt and uncle on my paternal side. It was going okay until last weekend when my parents brought up a topic of conversation that I (17m) am so tired of hearing and being pulled into.

So let me explain the non adoption and why it bugs me. My dad had a kid before he met my mom. My half sister (24f). My dad had primary custody of my half sister, her mom was in and out of her life. My parents met when my half sister was 2 and got married when she was 4. Her mom was in and out of prison, was on and off drugs and alcohol and she was really disruptive to my half sister's life and to my parents. She refused to stay away but refused to be a good mom too. When I was 2 or 3 her mom offered to walk away for good but only if they removed any chance that she could be sued for child support, etc. My mom was willing to adopt my half sister. The three adults wanted this to happen but because of my half sister's age, her wishes held a lot of weight and she didn't want my mom to adopt me, and it never happened. So her mom kept the back and forth for a few more years before giving up the relationship with my half sister completely. My parents were so upset that my half sister rejected having a stable and loving mom in my mom for a woman who even she admitted was so mean to her and didn't take good care of her. But my half sister never really liked my mom from what I witnessed. 

It's a really big deal to my parents and I have grown up hearing about it way more than I need to. They told me details I didn't need to know, when I was too young to be hearing them, they would suck the fun out of things bringing it up. And I know they hold it against my half sister. They think my sisters (14f and 13f) and I do too but the lack of closeness has nothing to do with the not adoption and everything to do with our half sister not wanting to be close to us. I asked my parents to stop bringing it up around us a few times. They ignored me. Until they said they got it and would listen.

But last weekend my parents brought it up while family was over and I was so not wanting to hear about it so I got up in the middle of breakfast and left the house and didn't come back all day. My parents were so mad at me for that. I told them I couldn't listen to them talk about it again and they couldn't help themselves but I wasn't going to turn it into a fight to stop them. They told me walking out without permission is bad enough but when we have family here is disrespectful and they told me I'm old enough to know and do better. This was a sore point the whole week.

85,1d10ww2,AITA for not inviting my cousin’s girlfriend to my wedding reception?,"My (27f) fiancé (29m) and I are getting married in August. It is a tiny ceremony with only my parents and his two closest friends in attendance. We are then holding a party a couple of days later, where the wider family are invited to come and celebrate with us at a local venue.

We have struggled a bit with the guestlist – his mother isn’t invited, and various other people who we either don’t like or don’t really speak to. It’s not exactly an exclusive event, but we have prioritised the people we care about most. It’s not a huge venue, so we can’t invite everyone.

The issue is that my eldest cousin’s girlfriend bullied me when we were teenagers. We were best friends since nursery, but when we started secondary school, she (for no reason I am aware of) told me she didn’t want to be seen with me anymore. I don’t want to go into detail about it, but her bullying caused me to have an eating disorder so severe I was taken to hospital and received treatment. She made horrible comments about my body and got other people to join in as well. This went on for years. After we left secondary school, it stopped. 

I have seen her a few times since - I have not made conversation, but given her a polite nod and left it at that. She hasn’t tried to talk me and she has not apologised. I know it may be silly to hold onto something that happened so long ago but I still receive therapy today for the issues caused by the bullying I experienced. 

I have not invited her to the party, as I don’t want anyone there who has said those kinds of things about me and done the things that she has done. My cousin has unfortunately said this means he will not be coming. This also means that my aunt is very upset and feels we are being unreasonable and she is also threatening to not come unless we extend the invitation to her as well. My family do not know everything she has done - they think it is just “silly teenager bickering”, but it was so much more than that to me. 

I am feeling really conflicted about it as I do want my cousin there, he is one of my favourite family members and does mean a lot to me. Am I being unreasonable? Should I suck it up for one day and let her come? I know it may be silly, but I just don’t know what to do. My dad thinks if I don’t want her that I shouldn’t have her there, as it should be about me and my (soon-to-be) husband. My mum wants me to keep the peace and keep the family together on what she feels is a very important day. I just don’t know what to do. My fiancé says it is entirely my decision as the experience is mine and therefore it could only be my decision.

87,1d10ttm,AITA for yelling at my gf for having her ex bring her food ,"AITA for yelling at my gf for having her ex bring her food when i’m at work 

So to start, my gf and her ex have a pretty weird relationship, they dated for a long time and he’s basically a part of her family. He was pretty shitty partner while he was hooked on drugs but has since sobered up and is doing better. after a really long time of not liking him i finally decided to talk to him myself and needless to say it sorta made things better for me i guess. it still sits weird with me that they’re close still but i realized that’s a battle im never gonna win and id rather just stay with her. 
anyways, the past few days i been running rather low on money but mainly because i had to pay rent this coming week and she asked me for money to help pay for her anger management class, i told her i can help but it would leave me basically broke, she understood and was appreciative. 
she was texting me at work yesterday telling me she was hungry and i definitely was a bit hungry myself. but i told her the only money i had left i had to save to afford dinner for us. I usually don’t eat lunch or anything in between so i can use the money for the both of us to eat later on. 
i came home last night with our dinner and she was asleep with a bunch of empty mcdonald’s wrappers next to her, and i said “wait where did u get all the food i thought u needed help?” 
and she then told me her ex dropped it off to her. 
i then got pretty upset and said it was weird that i couldn’t really afford food in the middle of the day so she ends up getting her ex to bring her food for her, and i told her it felt like she was being selfish with her money asking me to help her with her class but then making sure she has enough money to buy food for herself, all while not even offering to help split the dinner i was saving my money to buy for us later that night.
she argued back saying i was being “insecure” and i was upset over “mcdonald’s” and i was just jealous i was hungry all day and didn’t have anything to eat but she did. I mean, look…. maybe i was jealous? idk, i practically starve myself through the day to pay for dinner for the both of us. so i guess i just got bitter over it? i talked to him and he apologized and said he should be communicating to me if he plans on doing stuff for her which i appreciated. 

she told me it was actually selfish of me to expect her to suffer without food just because i am, and that she never asks me to feed her like that so what i’m doing by not eating and spending my money on us and struggling in the process more or less is my own problem. 

maybe im crazy? am i over reacting?

I mean, look…. maybe i was jealous? idk, i practically starve myself through the day to pay for dinner for the both of us. so i guess i just got bitter over it? i talked to him and he apologized and said he should be communicating to me if he plans on doing stuff for her which i appreciated. 

she told me it was actually selfish of me to expect her to suffer without food just because i am, and that she never asks me to feed her like that so what i’m doing by not eating and spending my money on us and struggling in the process more or less is my own problem. 

maybe im crazy? am i over reacting?


edit: thank you for all the cooking from home suggestions but honestly the main reason i made this post was regarding me getting upset with her acting in a way that seemed almost inconsiderate to me. But i appreciate the tips! ",2.0,0.9962959885597229,1,0

The other guy who was going to get the train says my name and says “Sorry please can you go and get [girl’s name] because our train leaves in literally 2 minutes”. I’m the only one who can get her because I’m the only other girl. So I quickly run to the toilet to get her.

When I get back I start talking to my ex again and he says “I was talking to you and you left”.

I said that he said my name so I’m not going to just ignore someone when they say my name. And when he said their train leaves in 2 minutes I realised I had to go and get the other girl right away.

91,1d0zvr9,AITA calling out my brother for being rude to my wife in an effort to get her to side with him on a baby name debate with his wife?,"My brother and SIL are expecting their first child in July. So far they have no name and in the last 3-4 weeks my brother has been trying to get my wife involved in this discussion. The reason he wants my wife to give her input is because his wife likes names he does not, he finds them ugly and not fit for grown people names (so boy names on girls, girl names on boys, unisex names, nicknames as full names and nature or word names). My wife and her siblings have names that fit all the things SIL loves and my brother hates. For example my wife's first name is Birdie and one of her brothers is Delaney. My brother has a particular issue with my wife's name for hitting three of his no-no categories, nature, word and nickname.

My brother has been arguing with SIL that the names she likes do not work for adults and she should go for something classic and sophisticated and not something that ages badly. Because of my wife and her siblings names, he believed she would be on his side. Now, given my wife has kept her name for 28 years you would think it would be clear this is not true and that she clearly doesn't hate it or feel like it's ruining her life. But my brother has asked her via text, DM and in person to get involved and speak about the issues with the names SIL likes.

I told my brother to stop four times already. The other times that I didn't know about when they were happening, my wife told him she didn't feel she should get involved.

My brother is getting more rude about it. Because he's insulting my wife and her siblings names by using them as examples, insulting their intelligence by saying anyone with those names would be idiotic to keep them as an adult and he's generally being a dick about it by telling my wife she NEEDS to speak to SIL for him. That she NEEDS to speak up. When she doesn't need to do anything he tells her.

I called him on being rude two days ago. I told him he can't make my wife side with him and he can't make her get involved when she doesn't want to. I said we both know this isn't our business, that this is their kid and they need to figure it out. My brother argued with me and said he wasn't being rude and he's allowed to ask for help to point out the dangers of giving a dumb fucking name. I told him he isn't owed her support and he owes her an apology for being so rude and insulting. My wife chimed in that he wouldn't like what she has to say.

My brother told me not to be such a dick about him looking for help so his kid doesn't end up with an awful name.

92,1d0zv8g,AITAH for wanting to go on a trip?,"I (f19) want to go on a trip with my bf (m19). We are graduating in about 2 weeks and I am terribly stressed so a few day trip away from everything after the graduation is just what I need. 

I asked my bf if he was interested in going w me and he said yes. First we looked into going to a hotel in our home country for an extended weekend, with a spa and wellness. But that would be quite expensive.

So I got the idea to go somewhere else. A city in our neighbouring country which is about a 2 hour drive away from my hometown. I know it very well as we went there a lot with my family for summer holidays as it is quite cheap and there is a lot to do. I speak the language and as I said, know the city well.
  
I presented the idea to my bf and he didn’t seem to have a problem with it. So you might think everything is okay. 

Well, everytime I plan a trip for us, even tho so far it has been always just a few hour thing, like for example visiting a waterfall near my hometown, visitng castle ruins, going to my local waterpark etc…… He spent the majority of the time complaining. Either the way to the sights was too long (the waterfall and ruins) or there was too much people (the waterpark) and a lot more other things. Which makes me scared that he will spent all of the trip, which we plan to make 3-4 days long, complaining with me feeling terrible for dragging him there. 

I told a friend of mine about his, and she told me that I am an a-hole for wanting him to go on a trip with me if I know he is not going to enjoy.

95,1d0y0l2,AITA For doing home renovations with my own 2 hands in an apartment we share with my granddad without discussing changes.,"I live with my grandad in an apartment we own 50/50. I do laundry, cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, etc.

I also do home renovation all by myself with my own money and labor, essentially making a Pinterest worthy home out of a scuffed old people den.

I mostly don't discuss changes  with my GD, but I also don't meddle with his half of the apartment. I fix up my small room, bathroom, hall, the kitchen and the balcony. His two large rooms are untouched.

I'm a big proponent of discussing things first with your close ones, but I don't discuss changes with him because he's a mild hoarder and if I start running things by him first nothing will ever get done, because ""the crumbling to dust wardrobe is good enough"".

So according to my GD I'm an asshole, even though I don't even throw away old broken stuff but instead give him an option to do something with it, or to take it to his summerhouse. Am I?

Feel free to ask any specifying questions, didn't want to make this too long.

96,1d0xwsb,AITA For Telling My Husband He Needs to Parent His Friends?,"Here’s a little information before I get started. My husband 27m and I 24f own a 3 bedroom 2 bath home. We found out in Sept 2023 that we were expecting our first child and my mother 47f moved in with us to help us with the baby in December 2023. My Husband found out in March 2024 that a couple that is his friends 26m and 27f were struggling bill wise and offered for them to move in with us. I only agreed after setting some boundaries he said they would agree to. My boundaries were, they had to help keep the house clean, they could not bring some of their feline animals, and they had to be aware they needed to get jobs asap. I also told my husband to let them know they are moving in during stressful times and told my husband any issues they have he is to deal with because “Not my circus not my monkeys.” They moved in in early April and to my husband and I surprise, our child was born 4 weeks early in the end of April. The worse has started in the few weeks of me being home from recovery. I am on maternity leave so I have been home 24/7 to take care of our child and recover. I have been noticing small disgusting things all over our house, such as packages of open raw meat in the fridge next to my pumped breast milk, the trash over flowing, half washed dishes thrown on top of clean dishes, food covering the oven, walls and stove. I have tried my best to keep up and clean but as stated I am still recovering and not only had a difficult pregnancy but also am having a hard recovery. I am struggling with Postpartum Depression and guilt for things like sleeping and not being able to produce enough breast milk for our child. The only person helping me with the house and some of the postpartum things is my mother, she is constantly working but still comes home almost everyday to clean the house, do dishes, and cook. However lately she has been confiding in me, more than six times a day, about small things my husbands friends are doing. Whether it’s using the kitchen scissors on something in their Bedroom, or not taking out the trash, I’m the first she tells. I have asked her many times to confide this information to my husband or even to his friends but she refuses and when I ask my husband to take the weight of her complaints my husband ignores her. For the last two weeks I have been going to my husband and asking him, please talk to your friends about XYZ to try and resolve the issues but he just shrugs or says he will and doesn’t. It had gotten to the point where I was trying to clean up something in the kitchen my mother was complaining about and tore one of my stitches. This led to me having a major breakdown and sobbing for over two hours while my husband and Mother tried to calm me down. This was not the first breakdown I had, and though I expressed my stress to them the situation still has not been fixed. Yesterday I noticed that my husbands friends have been dirtying the bathroom and not cleaning it, on top of that they moved all the items in the fridge I needed to get to, milk and other items, to cook and feed our child. When my husband got home from work I was so livid I told him I was tired of being the adult in the situation and he needed to teach his friends how to clean and do the dishes. Now he is ignoring me and angry saying they are adults and they are much cleaner than they’ve been in the past. Am I the Asshole and should apologize for over reacting or was I in the right?

I come over to my home usually on christmas but I am hoping to head over more often when I get a better job. My (54) mum and (53) auntie are comming over to see me in a month.
 
My mum has come over every year since I moved here, she started with my step dad but as much as he liked to see me he doesnt like leaving the small town much and decided he didn't want to come over again which is fair, I live in a historical and student city ao theres really nothing for him to do.

My mum loves history and shopping so she comes over she even ventures out to near by towns and city's if im busy, but she got abit sad comming on her own. So she asked one of my aunties to come join her. My 3 aunties live in the same country as me just the other side, it's quite expensive for us to go see each other for some reason ,so only one auntie can really afford it because she has a well paying job.

She came over last year and I brought my boyfriend out to come see my family too and we all hung out and had a really good time. However last night I found out that since they are comming over to visit next month they want to bring my cousin who is around their age. 

Honnestly my cousin is nice and I dont hold any ill will against her. However we arent very close, she was an adult my entire childhood and honnestly she interrupts me alot and can be alittle unintentionally rude at times. I have autism myself so I try to be patient and understand where she's comming from. But it does make me abit uncomfortable having her be there.

I dont want to be rude or hurt anyone's feelings but honnestly sometimes I feel like she doesn't like me too much and wonders why I am there. Like if im at my mums house and walk into the kitchen she seems to not like my presence and ignores me if my mum tries to get us to interact. It feels like she wouldn't enjoy comming over to see me because we really don't know each other. She goes on family and friend trips with my mum and auntie and sometimes even my mums co -workers often.

She also lives down the road from my mum so it's not like they don't see each other all the time. Again she is still very nice when we do talk and I dont hold anything against her , I just don't think we are that close and that she would wanna come over and see me. I think that she will just see it as another girls trip and I might be ignored again on the few days they are there.

101,1d0x8eb,AITA for telling my boyfriend to train his dog?,"I (21F) have had a small fear of big dogs. My Nan has a labrador, about 8 years old, that is extremely energetic. While he is a loving dog  I've never felt comfortable to pet him. I've always been scared of large dogs since I was a kid and got knocked down by 3 and had to get stiches.

I have a Shih Tzu cross myself and so when I first met my boyfriend (24M) he talked about going on walks with our dogs ect. Which I diddnt mind but explained that I'm quite nervous around meeting new dogs that are quite big and he diddnt have an issue with it. Unfortunately it was quite a few months before I would meet his dog due to what he said were family things he diddnt want to talk about. 

Those months before meeting his dog were great, as I'm not terrified of big dogs whenever I walk mine I tend to just walk around those walking big ones and there no issue. When meeting a big dog (of people I know) they always keep the leash on their dogs while I meet them. I know the dog isnt going to attack me it's just the size that intimidates me at first and mixed with the energy of meeting someone new it's a bit hectic.

My boyfriend has never said anything about my fear and usually walks in between me and whatever big dog is passing so I thought he would understand when I met his. We met up at a field and his dog who is a black lab, was pulling on his lead and while I dont want to criticise my boyfriend it honestly looked like he had no control.

Before we even reached eachother he let his dog off the leash and it came running at us.  I kept calm while my boyfriend laughed and his ran off with mine to play.

When I came time to leave I called my dog gave her a treat and clipped her leash back on. When he called his the dog never came and continued to run about so my boyfriend went after him as I stood there for about 10 minutes watching. I also watched as my boyfriend tried to give him a treat and he nearly bit his hand to which he started yelling at him. There argument came when he said he wasnt going to put a leash on his dog. I know lots of people dont use leashes but we had to cross a road when cars are known to speed and by a primary school. 

From watching how he pretty much has no control over his dog I urged him to put the leash on so we could leave. He asked why so I told him his dog needs some training. He started yelling at him saying how his dog is trained and that I should let my ""silly little fear"" get in the way of his dog. When we crossed by the school there were a few kids outside and his dog went upto every single one until my boyfriend grabbed his collar and walked him away.

When we got back he yelled at me some more about how I hate his dog only because of his size and told me he was going home.I've never said I hated his dog,his dog just seems very untrained. I also dont expect people to make accommodations for me but would've thought that he would understand when meeting his. I dont know if I could've handled it better but he's my first boyfriend and I dont want to break up over this

I stated that it was a penny stock and he insisted it was not, to which I questioned his perspective and didn't believe it in an instance, so I told him my logic behind it and he had to explain his perspective to me. 
He got annoyed and told me that because he is my man I should not question his statements as much. But the thing is that to me it was a normal debate and a conversation where I wasn't just blindly stating my opinion but was rather asking questions to understand better what he ment. 
To that he replied if I talk to other man in the same way and I said yes, because we are literally talking about investing, so a debate topic. To me a debate is to tell what I know, get others perspectives and then talk about it. He says I was challenging him. He also told me I should think why do I talk to other man in the same manor I do with him. He was a bit cold and harsh doing it.
For me the date was instantly ruined because I felt like I can't have a normal discussion and ask questions and have to be careful around what I say not to annoy him, but the thing is this is just me, but I don't know, he is saying it disrespects him as a man.  
So AITA? Should I just believe everything to show him respect?

103,1d0wi1o,AITA for calling by father out on his actions?,"I (23F) finally had enough of my dad(43M) getting away with playing the victim. My father has always lied about stuff he hears. He constantly talks behind everybody's backs and thinks that it's okay but the moment that somebody says something about his lies, he gets defensive and pissed off.

This morning we were all sitting by the campfire when D said something that my father told him another person(H) said but then H flat out told them what she had said and it was one of those sentence that if you emphasize certain words of the sentence, it can be interpreted differently. All in all this issue was resolved in about 20 mins but the part that pissed me off was the fact that my father took off all pissed off and left us at the campground and drove home (45mins) with the only vehicle we had here and he loaded up all of our four wheelers and took them home as well even though we were going to be riding the next day. So now we can't go riding with all of our group.

So now we have nothing to do and I'm pissed because I'm the one who paid the $300 to come camping here on the trails since they didn't have the money and he took my fourwheeler. He has no regard for anyone else's time or money or property at all and what he wants or says goes so finally I lost it. I yelled at him that he's the problem and that he's the one causing the rift between everyone not D. I flat out told him that if all he was going to do was bitch about the group were with then he shouldn't have came camping in the first place. I yelled at him that he is responsible for his actions not D and that he needs to man the fuck up and face the consequences and that he was a grown ass man. He proceeded to tell me that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here and that I needed to shut up and mind my business.

Now I have never been one to hold my tongue against my father at all. I will tell him straight out that he has nothing without my mom because he likes to tell everyone who will listen that he has four wheelers, campers, cars, etc. but in reality they are all my maternal grandfathers and I will NOT have my father take credit for my grandpa's hard work. My father is a bipolar narcissist and likes to just say ""I don't mean to yell"" but then proceed to scream at my mother or me. I have literally gotten yelled at for having a panic attack while he's been on the phone before and instead of attempting to help calm me down just screamed at me to shut up and get away from him. I have never once gone to him for anything and if I was ever in trouble or need help, I sure as hell would never call him since he has never been reliable in my life ever before. I flat out screamed at him that he had no right to say shit about D's choices when D has more to his name then my dad has ever had and that at least D admits that he has a anger problem and that even those D is only 23 he's still more mature than my father is.

104,1d0wdwm,AITA: Aita for telling my husband he can't invite someone to the movies with us? ,"I (39 enby) and my husband(38 m) have been together for 10 years and are polyamourous. He recently started pursuing a lovely woman I'll call Mandy. Now Mandy is a very sweet person and I have no problems with her at all and I'm excited for him but here's the issue. 

My husband had bought tickets for an upcoming film for him, me, and my partner of a year(34 m) to go to. This is not unusual as we do outings the 3 of us regularly and affection is kept to a minimum out of respect. He also purchased a ticket for Mandy. When he asked about it, I told him I wasn't comfortable with it as I didn't know her very well and wasn't to that point yet. Apparently I wasn't clear and he invited her and bought the extra ticket anyway. Today(2 days later) we discover the original plan was as an early b day gift for me since the movie release is a month prior to that day. 

Here's where I may be the a-hole. I informed him of the bday information and repeated I wasn't comfortable after I was already grumpy about an issue at the store, telling him I'm used to not having anything for myself at this point. He got upset, canceled 1 ticket and canceled the outing with her due to ""other stuff going on"". I feel guilty for establishing a boundry but will be refusing to not post pictures and tag him in them. 

So aita for not wanting her there and likely causing him to cancel? 

EDIT: I want to clarify a couple of things. 1. Yes my husband invited my partner as a friend no different than any other friend. This is normal for us. 2. Mandy and my husband are not dating as of yet and she  is still basically a stranger to me. while I'm excited to get to know her I don't feel a birthday  activity for me is an appropriate time to do so.",Asshole,2024-05-26,"AITA: Aita for telling my husband he can't invite someone to the movies with us?

105,1d0w7ld,AITA for not washing the dishes?,"So i (M22) live with two other roommates, Julie (F20) and Brooklyn (F22). We all have it planned out for us that it works better if we have weekly chores split between the living room, kitchen, and bathroom rather than cleaning throughout the week or waiting on whoever to clean up after themselves. We also share essentially everything in the house besides the stuff in our rooms (and something else i'll mention later) so it's more equal/fair this way.

I usually clean the living room, until Thursday i came home to the living room and bathroom clean, but not the kitchen. My roommate (Julie) told me she was tired so she cleaned the living room instead since it was easier, and it was my turn to do the kitchen since our other roommate did the bathroom. This would be fine except I have contamination OCD and don't use any of their dishes. I have my own small collection of dishes that i wash immediately after use and they're not allowed to touch. This is the one other thing in our house that we don't share besides the stuff in our bedrooms. I had used them throughout the week but, as i said, i wash them immediately after use and they were already put away so none of the dishes in the sink were mine.

I told her this, and offered to clean the rest of the kitchen, but that i wouldn't be doing the dishes. She argued that that wouldn't be fully cleaning the kitchen then, and that i should just do it because it's just this week. I argued that it wasn't fair for me to clean a mess that isn't mine, which she argued about how we agreed to share these responsibilities regardless of who made the mess which isn't entirely true. I was fine with cleaning up after them in the living room and bathroom because i also create mess in there, which is why i agreed to this arrangement. We argued a bit more after that, and i got tired of it and walked off. I did exactly as i said i would and cleaned the kitchen (floor, counters, etc.) but left the dishes.

The next day (Friday) Brooklyn asked why the dishes weren't done and i explained which led to another argument between me, and both Brooklyn and Julie. That argument ended in all of us ignoring each other, but i still refused to do the dishes. I wasn't sure what would happen, I honestly planned on either Julie or Brooklyn doing them and then making up for it next cleaning week, but later that day i had my boyfriend (Dylan, M23) over and on Saturday morning i woke up the Julie putting the dirty dishes on my bed while both of us (me and Dylan) were in it. I got out of bed and started yelling at her, which made Dylan get involved. He ended up taking her side, which is what made me start questioning if i was TA.

I ended up doing the dishes after Dylan left and i cleaned my room but i'm still mad at my roommates (mainly Julie) and haven't talked to them, they keep trying to talk to me and tell me i'm overreacting but i don't know, i was fine with cleaning the kitchen, just not the dishes.

I (19F) am currently on a girls trip with my friends, I'm gonna call them X (19F), Y (18F) and Z (19F). X is one of my best friends and we're in one room together, Y and Z are my close friends.
Yesterday we decided to visit the city. It was a long trip - about 1.5 hour bus drive through the mountains, a lot of walking, and a 32* heat. We arrived around 12:00, and at 6:00 we decided to sit down for a couple drinks and relax. By that point I was exhausted. I have some issues that cause me to be in pain for no reason. When I'm tired, no matter how I sit, stand up or lay down, something always hurts me and I can't find a comfortable position. So, I changed into a tshirt, put my hair up, and tried to relax.
At some point Z asked me, X and Y to pose for a photo. At first I moved away, so l'm not in it, but she kept asking me to move back. So I did. When she showed us the photo I immediately got upset - I looked like I haven't slept in the last week and gained 10kg. I said I hate it but she said I looked nice and asked to take another one. I moved away again, but she didn't want to take it until l posed. So I did, and the second photo wasn't better.
I have severe body and image issues. I hate having photos or videos taken of me. I also have an eating disorder. I've been struggling with anorexia since I was 12. For the past year, due to stress and trauma, l've been stuck in a binge cycle, which caused me to go gain a lot. I'm super insecure about my body. The photos were awful, I looked huge and tired. Especially next to my friends, who are very beautiful.
I thought she wouldn't post them. But when we came back to the hotel, around 11pm, Z asked if she can post it on her story. Both X and Y immediately said yes. I was exhausted and in pain by then, so l reluctantly said yes, but I think u could tell I wasn't happy with that by my tone. Soon after we went back to our rooms and I saw Z tagged me in her story. I looked disgusting. Knowing all of our mutual friends - which is 90% of my friends, we went to school together - saw it upset me so much, I started crying in the bathroom.
X kept asking me if I'm okay cause she heard that I was crying. I kept saying yes and that she didn't do anything and I'm fine, but she kept pressuring me. At some point I just told her that ""I'm fine, god”. I didn't want to say anything. I was afraid they're gonna think it's stupid and get mad at me. X said it's fine, but if the next day I'm gonna be upset, she's gonna get mad.
Now it is the next day. The girls went to breakfast but I stayed in our room. I pretended I was still asleep, but I'm just skipping it, cause I still feel disgusting and sad.

109,1d0vmot,AITA for telling my grandmother that I won't cry when she dies?,"here is some context.
I (22) do not have a good relationship with my biological father, nor my paternal grandmother.
When I was 18 years old, It happened that that day I went with my dad to another city (where my university is), on the way back we passed by an aquarium where they sold fish and my dad went in to buy 1 for his personal fish tank and I stayed in the car to wait for him checking my phone and trying instagram filters.
At that time, I began to identify as a bisexual boy and I had a lot of self-esteem problems. I didn't feel handsome or attractive, so I didn't like photographs or taking photos of myself.
My paternal grandmother is a ""well-off"" person because of her job, she tends to judge my tastes, hobbies and personality very easily, since I am his first grandchild and I have many of my dad's physical traits, adding the factor that it is also VERY conservative.
When I was testing Instagram filters, I decided to take a photo with a filter that I liked but because of the lighting from the sun I couldn't see what THAT filter added blush and the effect of painted lips, at that moment I felt good about myself and thinking that I rarely take photos where I am ""genuinely happy"", I didn't think about it and uploaded the photo to Instagram.
When I got home with my mom, I received a call from my paternal grandmother, furious, saying why the hell had I put that on my face, saying that I looked horrible and disgusting, I didn't understand anything until I saw the photo and I tried to explain to him but she didn't listen to me, ALL BECAUSE OF A FUCKING INSTAGRAM FILTER!
Obviously I started to cry, my dad saw this and instead of calming me down and telling my grandmother that she was exaggerating, he decided to turn against me too, my mom obviously got upset and ordered them to shut the hell up.

I (22) do not have a good relationship with my biological father, nor my paternal grandmother.
When I was 18 years old, It happened that that day I went with my dad to another city (where my university is), on the way back we passed by an aquarium where they sold fish and my dad went in to buy 1 for his personal fish tank and I stayed in the car to wait for him checking my phone and trying instagram filters.
At that time, I began to identify as a bisexual boy and I had a lot of self-esteem problems. I didn't feel handsome or attractive, so I didn't like photographs or taking photos of myself.
My paternal grandmother is a ""well-off"" person because of her job, she tends to judge my tastes, hobbies and personality very easily, since I am his first grandchild and I have many of my dad's physical traits, adding the factor that it is also VERY conservative.
When I was testing Instagram filters, I decided to take a photo with a filter that I liked but because of the lighting from the sun I couldn't see what THAT filter added blush and the effect of painted lips, at that moment I felt good about myself and thinking that I rarely take photos where I am ""genuinely happy"", I didn't think about it and uploaded the photo to Instagram.
When I got home with my mom, I received a call from my paternal grandmother, furious, saying why the hell had I put that on my face, saying that I looked horrible and disgusting, I didn't understand anything until I saw the photo and I tried to explain to him but she didn't listen to me, ALL BECAUSE OF A FUCKING INSTAGRAM FILTER!
Obviously I started to cry, my dad saw this and instead of calming me down and telling my grandmother that she was exaggerating, he decided to turn against me too, my mom obviously got upset and ordered them to shut the hell up.

110,1d0vlsk,AITA- I got mad at my family for eating some of my christmas gift,"Leading up to last year's Christmas, my family was asking what I wanted and I only had a couple answers. One of those was a bulk box of my favorite potato chips. The company only makes them in small bags, so I was getting a box of 25 5oz bags. The other big gift I got was a Nintendo Switch and a game to go with it. My mom got me the Switch and game, while my grandma got the chips. 

When I was opening my box of chips on Christmas day, I noticed there was a little bit of empty space in the box, but I didn't say anything. I took out one of the bags and started eating the chips. I asked my family members if they wanted some, and my grandma said she'd already had some. I asked if she had bought some at the store, but she said no, that her and my uncle opened my box after it arrived in the mail and each ate a bag on their own. I was mad when she told me that and I'm pretty sure nobody in my family understood why I was angry. 

I was 17 that Christmas, going on 18, and I felt a little patronized. I guess they ate some because they decided it wasn't a big deal, and to be fair it is not a big deal, but I can't think of when it has ever been normal to eat a bit of somebody's gift. My christmas gift for that year only had 5 or 6 things on it, and I got 4 of the things (I did get other presents from my family btw.) I'm not trying to demonize my family or sound ungrateful, I'm just a little pissed that my relatives helped themself to some of my Christmas gift and acted like it didn't matter.

Some context: My birthday is a little over a week after Christmas, so I don't get many gifts on my birthday. My mom was going to buy me a Switch the year before, but I declined because there were no games i wanted to play on it (Tears of The Kingdom came out in between the 2 Christmases so I had a reason to get it)

How it worked was that you threw 1 dollar coin and had to try and land it onto the chocolate bar, and if you did you won the chocolate bar. Now, my friend had bought 15 or so coins which he gave around to our friends and I had used 5 of his coins and won nothing, whereas he was quite good at landing coins onto the chocolate bars and he had already won 5 bars by this point. After we had all used up my friend's coins we decided to take a lunch break after lunch, I told him that I would give him 5 more coins to try and win more chocolate and we promised that we would evenly split the chocolate he won with my 5 dollars among us two. After we had lunch the event was wrapping up so the organisers of the chocolate event decided to stack the remaining chocolate bars into one big pile (around 11 bars of chocolate), with the 5 coins I gave my friend, he went and won the stack of chocolate. But before we could split the chocolate we had to go to class so my friend decided to lock all the chocolate we won into his locker and told me he would give me the chocolate after class. But after class, my friend left without splitting the chocolate and didn't leave me a single bar, when I texted him asking if he took all the chocolate he just said ""Mb I will give it to you tomorrow"".

114,1d0v07u,AITA for Continuing Our Street Bubble Show Despite Complaints from Nearby Vendors?,"My partner and I perform a street soap-bubble show, which is our only source of income. We found a public place with a lot of foot traffic that fits all the criteria for a proper show. There are also street vendors (selling popcorn) and a few other artists working in the area. We obtained permission from the local authorities, who were very positive after seeing our show.

One of the vendors is an immigrant who worked hard to establish his small business and supports a large family. We became friends initially, but after a few days, he became enraged and cold towards us, accusing us of harming his business because people get too absorbed by our show to buy popcorn. He was very aggressive and didn't want to discuss solutions. We later found out that his youngest son had developed a tumor, which explained his upset behavior. We offered any help we could, which he was too proud to accept, but we ended up on good terms again as he said, ""only my son matters now.""

We continued working a few times a week for a few hours and visited him every day to ask about his boy, who enjoyed playing with bubbles. Recently, however, he became angry again, accusing us of stealing his business. He also convinced the nearby painter, a friend of his, to say that our show harms his business too. I don't believe this is true—how can a bubble show harm someone selling paintings or popcorn? Despite offering to find a solution together, he insists that the only solution is for us to perform for just one hour per day, 2-3 days a week, which doesn't work for us.

I understand his difficult situation and feel bad for his son, but he constantly tries to guilt-trip me using his family. I also rely exclusively on this income and my family has serious health problems that drained all our savings. I think, since I have permission, I should continue working normally and not pay attention to him unless he genuinely wants to find an inclusive solution.

116,1d0u5ta,AITA for ending the friendship?,"A month before my elopement, my best friend (30F) of 10 years (who was part of my bridal party) told me I was taking away from her elopement because me and my fiance were getting eloped on the same mountain as her when she got eloped a couple years ago. 

We had our own personal reasons we wanted to be on that mountain and we wanted our friends to be there because they are like our family. I thought she would be excited for me, and she was the first person I told about our plans. 

A month before the elopement, she calls me and says that she feels upset about how we didn’t ask her if we can get eloped on the same mountain that she got eloped on and by us having our elopement there, we were taking away meaning from her day because it was her and her partner’s special spot. She told me she thought I was shoving my elopement plans in her face,  bringing all of our friends there when we are already planning a bigger wedding next year, and that she didn’t have a big wedding. She continued to say that I was copying her elopement and that it was like getting the same wedding dress as her. 

Our elopement location was on the same mountain, in a totally different location, had a different back drop of mountains, and was during the winter with snow. Hers was during the summer. 

I told her that didn’t realize it was on the same mountain because hers was planned so privately and that I didn’t want her to feel this hurt. So my partner and I considered changing our elopement plans and location (this is weeks before the elopement after we made our hotel accommodations and our friends were going to make a weekend out of it). Eventually we decided to keep our plans because it felt true and authentic to our relationship. 

I later found out that they didn’t actually get eloped there. They took elopement photos and said their personal vows there, then got eloped in the city with only their immediate family members present. She didn’t end up coming to my elopement because I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable having her there because it felt weird to me that she was going to be having all these feelings and thoughts during a special moment in our lives. I also asked her to be a guest instead of a bridesmaid. 

This brought so much stress to the planning and ruined my excitement for the day. When I got to the mountain, I cried because of not having a dear friend there and due to all the stress and sadness she made around something so special to me. 

Now it’s been a few months after we got eloped, and I’ve been hearing that she is still upset about this and that she is the one who is hurt in the friendship. I decided to end our friendship because it was clear to me that she wasn’t going to reflect deeper and gain more self awareness around this situation. 

Am I missing something here and did I do something wrong to hurt my (former) friend? Should I have never ended the friendship at all? Should she still be invited to the wedding?

We had our own personal reasons we wanted to be on that mountain and we wanted our friends to be there because they are like our family. I thought she would be excited for me, and she was the first person I told about our plans. 

A month before the elopement, she calls me and says that she feels upset about how we didn’t ask her if we can get eloped on the same mountain that she got eloped on and by us having our elopement there, we were taking away meaning from her day because it was her and her partner’s special spot. She told me she thought I was shoving my elopement plans in her face,  bringing all of our friends there when we are already planning a bigger wedding next year, and that she didn’t have a big wedding. She continued to say that I was copying her elopement and that it was like getting the same wedding dress as her. 

Our elopement location was on the same mountain, in a totally different location, had a different back drop of mountains, and was during the winter with snow. Hers was during the summer. 

I told her that didn’t realize it was on the same mountain because hers was planned so privately and that I didn’t want her to feel this hurt. So my partner and I considered changing our elopement plans and location (this is weeks before the elopement after we made our hotel accommodations and our friends were going to make a weekend out of it). Eventually we decided to keep our plans because it felt true and authentic to our relationship. 

I later found out that they didn’t actually get eloped there. They took elopement photos and said their personal vows there, then got eloped in the city with only their immediate family members present. She didn’t end up coming to my elopement because I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable having her there because it felt weird to me that she was going to be having all these feelings and thoughts during a special moment in our lives. I also asked her to be a guest instead of a bridesmaid. 

This brought so much stress to the planning and ruined my excitement for the day. When I got to the mountain, I cried because of not having a dear friend there and due to all the stress and sadness she made around something so special to me. 

Now it’s been a few months after we got eloped, and I’ve been hearing that she is still upset about this and that she is the one who is hurt in the friendship. I decided to end our friendship because it was clear to me that she wasn’t going to reflect deeper and gain more self awareness around this situation. 

Am I missing something here and did I do something wrong to hurt my (former) friend? Should I have never ended the friendship at all? Should she still be invited to the wedding?

Edit:
This is how I’m using the word elopement

He went against a black girl and lost. I have never seen a black girl as a board one and was happy to see her succeed. Black people aren’t seen as the most intelligent in society and there aren’t many black people in chess, at least there weren’t many that went to state and succeeded. There also aren’t many women who succeed in chess at least compared to men. So I thought this would be recognized as a good thing. I waited a little while and while we’re practicing, I said, well I wanted the black girl to win. He was talking to a black girl at the time and he is also my best friend. I thought he would see that as a positive, if I didn’t I wouldn’t have said anything. I personally think I should have worded it better or gradually built up to it. I don’t hate white men, nor do I think black women are the best people alive. I just wanted to express my support for her while attempting to cheer up my friends. AITA?

118,1d0txwr,AITA for refusing to clean cat poop off the floor?,"This may be a gross one, so warning for themes of cat poop. So I (20F) moved into an apartment with a roommate (19F) that I met off a roommate search website for our college. I brought my cat with me, and I got along with the girl pretty well, she’s just a bit of an entitled rich girl - her dad pays her rent and I had to teach her how to use a mop. I do most of the cleaning because she ignores the cleaning schedule. Whatever, I put up with it because she’s nice and I’m a bit of a people pleaser. My cat was never an issue, I always keep his litter box clean and she loves him. 

One day, my roommate and I decided to visit the animal shelter that I volunteer at from time to time. We go and she starts freaking out over these two kittens. I’ll admit they were cute, but I made it clear that they would be her responsibility and I wouldn’t be taking care of them because I didn’t want to adopt anymore pets. But I figured she’s an adult and our apartment is big enough. We bring them home and everything is just peachy. 

Within a couple weeks, the apartment STINKS. I realized she hasn’t been cleaning her cats’ litter box. I was upset but I cleaned it because I couldn’t stand the smell anymore and text her about it. She apologizes, says she’s just been busy and will fix it. Time goes on and it keeps stinking, I keep cleaning it because I can’t stand it, keep texting her, nothing changes. I start spending more time at my boyfriend’s apartment because the smell is so bad. I’ve come home before to find POOP on the floor because even the kittens can’t stand their biohazard litter box. I talk to her and she just argues with me saying “my schedule is so much busier than yours, it takes priority, I just don’t have time to clean it.” I feel bad for the kittens, so I suggest she takes them back to the shelter since she doesn’t have time for them but she won’t. Now it’s gotten to the point where they poop on the floor and she pretends like she doesn’t see it because she knows I’ll come home and have to clean it up because I’m not the kind of person that would leave poop on the floor.

Well tonight I came home to a pile of steaming hot shit on the floor and just stepped right over it and told her I’m done cleaning up after her cats and I wasn’t doing it anymore. I told her it’s disgusting and disrespectful to leave cat shit on the floor all day and that she was gross. She starts crying and tells me she’s just been so stressed and busy with summer classes and that it was just “inconvenient” for her to clean the litter box and that she just figured it wasn’t that bad for me to clean it because I’m not as busy. I feel bad because her parents obviously failed her and she never had to clean up after herself before. I feel disgusting right now because the poop is still marinating on the floor but I am NOT going to clean it up. So AITA because I refused to clean it up and made her cry?

119,1d0tozo,AITA for defending a girl who manipulated and broke up my friend group,"We are all F17

I  was a part of a friend group, made up of a bunch of guys and girls. As of this year we started hanging out with this girl let’s call her Meg.
I just want to say that Meg has been through a lot in life. I don’t want to say this specifics because it’s not my story to tell. She carries a lot of trauma and PTSD from that. 

About a month ago, I get a call from my best friend  let’s call her Grace and she’s was upset. I asked her what happened and she tells me that Meg told her that a couple people in the friend group were accusing me and Grace of talking shit about them and saying that we didn’t actually like anyone etc. I then  call Meg. I asked her what happened, at first she was really mad that Grace told me. I thought that was weird, she then sent over screenshots of the messages she shared with this other person in the friend group called Aly. Aly was apparently the one telling people this. This is when I started noticing red flags, text messages Meg sent had sections cropped out. There was also a point  where Aly was trying to get us all together to talk and Meg said that wasn’t a good idea.

The next day I get a notification that a group chat had been created with most of the other people in the friend group but not Meg. There was a message from Aly and others saying Meg had lied to all of us and was pretty much manipulating everyone. At first I didn’t believe this because that just seemed crazy. I start texting in the group chat and we decide to meet in an empty classroom to discuss what was happening. I’m not gonna get into the finer details of what exactly happened but to put it simply Meg had been talking to pretty much everyone in the friend group and telling lies to different people  so basically what she told me she also told everyone else, but the opposite version. Aly also showed me the actual text conversation and confirmed that the messages were definitely cropped when they were sent to me. We decided to cut her off and stopped being friends. (We told her this)

this past week Aly and a few other people in the friend group have been going around and  shit talking Meg where I do understand that they are upset the things that they are talking about are not anyone’s business. They have been telling people personal things about Meg and going into detail. They have also been making fun of her at every single chance they get.

I want to stay right now that I do not like Meg but I don’t believe sharing others peoples personal matters is okay.

Grace and I decided to say something. we told Aly and the others that what they were doing wasn’t okay and where we understood how Meg had hurt all of us it wasn’t okay to share really personal information like that. 

They all got really mad and called us fake and said that we’re on her side now. Which is not true I’m still very upset about what she did. However, I understand that it  looks like I’m defending her actions. 

so am I the asshole for defending her even though she ruined our friend group?

I'm a (16F) and recently moved from Mexico to the USA, in Mexico I never had the need to take care of my brother but now since we moved here to America both of my parents now have to work. For them this means I have to take care of my 3 year old brother even though I don't want to. Recently they started treating me as a babysitter even when both of them are here and are just sitting there doing nothing, I don't mind helping with stuff like serving him food, changing his clothes and making sure he is safe, but I don't like the idea of actually having to be fully responsible for a kid all by myself. Today we were all in the same room (me, brother, mom and dad) and they asked me to change his diaper and put his pijamas on, I said I would put his pajamas on but I didn't want to change his diaper (I have never changed his diaper before), they both got mad at me and started saying it was my responsibility to take care of him, I said it's not because he is not my child but they started talking about how I was heartless and if they weren't here one day (referring to if one day one of them passes away) I would be the one to have to look after him.
