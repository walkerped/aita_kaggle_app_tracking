0,1d19qky,AITA for not telling my parents that I'm trans,"I (24F) started my social transition five months ago and my medical transition three weeks ago. My siblings and my friends know, but not my parents nor my extended family. 

However, I dress in a very feminine way most of the time, and my parents have caught on that something is going on that I'm not telling them. My mom asked me if I was trans a couple of months ago and I gave her an indecisive answer (tbf I was actually indecisive back then).

My siblings are mad at me because they say that I'm keeping them in the dark and making them confused and worried for no reason. Let me say that I'm not worried that they'll be transphobic or not accept me or whatever, I'm just not emotionally ready to tell them and just find coming outs awkward, so I'm just basically waiting for it to be obvious enough that it doesn't really become a shock to them when they officially find out.

1,1d0rsid,AITA for “slandering” my mom to the rest of my family ,"Yesterday I made plans with some friends to hang out at their house to make smores. My mom gave me permission to go but refused to drive me so my friends picked me up, which I already was mad at my mom about bc the friend only lives 5 minutes away and my mom was planning to leave the house pretty soon anyway. I never asked my mom what time I should be home by but I assumed she would tell me if it was urgent. Well time passes and now it’s around 9:30 pm so I call my mom to ask if she can pick me up on 10. I call her in front of my friends and friends parents bc I didn’t think it would be a big deal. She goes off on me saying she can’t pick me up bc she has to wake up at 4 am for church and I that I should’ve know better than to stay out so late and I’d better call a taxi or Uber or beg my friend to drop me off at home bc she shouldn’t have to deal with me if I choose to “go out to the streets”. I try to stay calm because again I’m in front of everyone so I just ask her “why are you mad at me” and again she just starts repeating everything she said then abruptly hangs up, essentially abandoning me (yes ik that i was safe/not in danger but the fact that she would even do that really hurt my feelings). She made my dad come and get me even though he’d just gotten back home from working All day (I didn’t call him for that reason). I get home and don’t speak to her but 10pm rolls around and she’s chatting on the phone with my aunt which confused me because she just claimed she couldn’t pick me up because she had to be asleep by 10. 


I would be able to drive myself if we had more parking space or if she’d just let me drive her car. No I wasn’t on the streets like she said. I was in a middle class suburban neighborhood and she has no reason to not trust me. I’ve been friends with this person for 9 years now and she’s met them. I go out with friends 1-2 times every 2 months and each time it’s to go to a restaurant or each others houses. I’m also a really good kid otherwise and I thought that after I got into Cornell, Princeton, and UMich and then committed to Princeton she’d finally be nice to me. 


This morning I asked my mom about why she couldn’t pick me up and she just replied “you can run around being a ho god knows where but don’t get me involved”. Later on some family came over but I was still visibly upset so my aunt asked me what was wrong and I basically had a break down about it all. I tell her everything that happened and that I don’t understand why she’s like with me. My aunt lectured my mom and ofc my mom got mad at me for making her look bad.

3,1d0rdvb,AITA for not responding to a friend who’s experiencing serious anxiety?,"To start, 11 years ago whilst I was at university, I (now F30, from the UK) made a friend online from the USA (now F27), we became friends over shared interests and the fact we’d had similar experiences growing up as we were both autistic. One thing I learnt quickly is that she did not have a good childhood at all. Her parents were neglectful and abusive and for the most part she was basically left to raise herself. Over the years we became very close as friends and remained in regular contact.

Now back to the present, in the past year she managed to move to Las Vegas from California to get away from her family. This is where things took a turn. It started when she was struggling to find work. She was getting extreme anxiety over said struggle, and although I tried to be supportive, understanding and encouraging, all I was met back with was anger and hostility (something of which I did not need at the time as my partner had just been fired from their job, so we were both feeling similar anxiety). It got to the point where I felt afraid to say anything without feeling like I was just making things worse.

She also began requesting video calls on Facebook and immediately hanging up just to get my attention during moments of said anxiety so I’d be able to respond fast.

It got worse in December when she broke a clavicle during a car accident (for reference, at this point she had/has a casino job). She was panicking that she would never be able to work again and would be homeless. Despite my attempts to understand and reassure her the injury alone shouldn’t stop her from working again, next morning I woke to lots of angry messages about how she would be homeless and how she hated that people were downplaying her issues.

I’ve really wanted to help, but I started to feel like I was being mistreated. At this point I was only ever being messaged when she had an issue, and although she did apologise when I explained how I was going through a lot of my own issues and started to talk more calmly, she still only talked to me whenever she had an issue.

Two things happened that made me feel I had enough. One was where she tried to get my help right as I was on a train in pain from what was later revealed to be a broken hand, and another when she tried calling me right when I was in the middle of a work shift. Granted, she couldn’t have known I had an accident or that I was working, but it made me feel like I was just a form of therapy rather than a friend. She even once said she needed some “therapy” from me. I know I should talk to her directly about how I’m feeling, but I can’t help but feel afraid she will get angry again.

I do still talk to her. But as I can’t help but feel anxiety (and some personal stuff going on), I’ve been much slower to respond. These past few days I’ve just not been able to respond at all. Nobody’s directly called me an asshole or even hinted at it, but I can’t help but feel I am and that I’m abandoning a friend in need.

4,1d0rc48,AITA for asking a man in his 40s to leash his large dog that keeps running up and barking at a disabled woman with a 🦯,"I was confused at first because this dog was running off leash to groups of people at a park. and nobody called when he ran up to a disabled person (appeared to have downs syndrome) who was walking with a white cane and singing. Given, she was walking kind of funny so I understand why the dog freaked out, ran up, and was barking. 

She froze and the dog backed off.

Once she starts walking again, the dog runs up, starts barking, disable woman screams and jumps to the side and cowers. She doesn't move until the dog runs away again.

Finally, the dog runs to the people right in front of me.  People in their 40's lounging on a park bench appear to be those the people who never left this small town after highschool.

The woman walks past this couple and they seem to be looking and snickering at her behavior.  Their dog crouches and walks towards her again.

I take a couple of steps forward, ""hey, is your dog?"" clearly confused how they had zero response to what was going on.

They appear to not have been bothered, so I explain what has taken place. As the disabled woman is walking towards the center of the park, I ask if they can leash their dog because she seemed afraid. This guy gets incredibly defensive that his dog is well trained and adamant that he saw what happened and it wasn't a problem because his dog is friendly.

Clearly the dog is scared of the woman and the woman is scared of the dog, but kind of not able to defend herself.

At this point, in my mind, this guy isn't someone to reason with so I just say, hey, please leash your dog because she's scared and there's leash laws here. Nope.

At least the dog is sitting right in front of me by this point because I have a piece of pizza in hand.

By happenstance a cop pulls up to the park and I walk over and explain the situation that the dog had run up to the woman barking, the disabled woman is clearly afraid of the dog, and the owners are doing nothing. He said he'll chat with them.

I go back to what I was doing on the other side of the other side of the park. While the cop is talking to him, the guy points at me, I wave, and just go back to what I was doing. He puts the dog on a leash.

After the cop leaves, this guy brings his 10 y/o over to throw a football and starts saying ""are you even local, are you from here? You should leave town now, you better watch out"". 

At this point, I just ignore this guy and do my thing. He walks back by me, takes his fingers from his eyes and points to me and says ""you better watch out"". 

The fact that he was threatening me gives me pause to the whole situation.

I think the family dynamics are slowly settling and I’m seen as the more “stricter” (I.e. probably overbearing) type that tries to provide routine, structure and safety to my child. My husband does the same but being an LCSW he takes a different approach. I do have anxiety and can get flustered easily which has always been my personal struggle since my teenage years. For the past few weeks/month or two my son constantly mouths “f*** you” to me all the time with a smirk on his face. My husband is OBLIVIOUS to these types of boundary pushes even when I ask him to pay a little more attention.

Cut to this weekend. My in-laws are up for the long weekend. We went out to an outdoor festival for the day and all day my son continues to push my boundaries, refusing to listen, mouthing “f*** you and “you little shit” and ignoring anything I ask. I tried putting up with it all day until this evening. Originally I told him bedtime was 8:15pm but then my husband told him he can stay up until 9:15pm without telling me. Which is fine and wasn’t my frustration. Well we are all sitting in the living room and when it’s time for my son to go to bed, I keep stating “ok it’s bedtime”. He ignores me until I repeat myself a few times and the turns to me and mouth “f*** you” with my husband and in-laws sitting right there. I finally got fed up and yelled “it’s time for bed” and he went off to bed with my husband tucking him in.

My husband is pissed for how I presented myself in front of his parents but I’m super upset and annoyed at how my son continues to speak to me and was just finally exhausted from it. I took the PS5 away and locked it in my office until I feel he can start straighten himself up. Was I in the wrong? Should I have just taken it until everyone went to bed and just removed the PS5? I feel like I should have done that. But was I the asshole who flipped out in front of everyone?

One thing VERY significant about A is that she and I are very close. To the point where I'd say she was my special person. And when she blew up on me my already tanking mental health hit rock bottom. Now I feel like I was the asshole for not asking first so hears the question.

8,1d0qqae,AITA for taking my friends credit card away from him?,"I (24M) have a friend (23M) that has horrible spending habits. He will come back from a trip out with 20 unnecessary things, and at minimum 100 dollar receipts. He buys things like take out, kitchen gadgets, little toys, infomercial products he never uses. I once saw him throw a whole xbox into the cart (he already has one). I promptly reminded him that he had one already, he responded “but this one is black.” He now has two xbox series S in two different colors.

He works a minimum wage job so he struggles to pay for anything essential. He always has to beg his mother for the change to pay for his apartment. I always tell him to stop, and he says he will work on it and budget better, but I see no changes. His mother also buys him groceries and he doesn’t own a car, but he ends up not having money for anything he needs.

He also has an addiction to collecting exotic fish. He will spend 2 hours sometimes perusing Facebook marketplace for his newest salt water fish that he can barely feed. Some of them started dropping dead from the water being so murky because he can’t afford a new filter.

He also has crippling credit card debt. He opted for the option to pay it over time slowly but he always amasses more somehow.

I had enough and to help his sorry ass out, I threw his credit card into a sewer drain. He can get a replacement but at least he won’t do it for awhile because his mother helps him manage his bank, and she only visits once a month.",Asshole,2024-05-26,"AITA for taking my friends credit card away from him?

9,1d0qaf4,AITA For refusing to pay for a gift that my ex bought for me?,"My ex boyfriend and I broke up about 2 months ago, and were in a relationship for a total of 2 and a half years. Our relationship was rocky, and to be honest pretty unhealthy. I broke things off with him for good, and he decided to move out and let me have the apartment (We are both on the lease, which is important for later.). He still has things at the apartment and his key.

Let's just say he isn't being the healthiest about our break up, and I don't go a week without him blowing up my phone over something. He'll text me and tell me how miserable he is one time and then text me about how happy he is about everything. He's trying to get me to reach out to him, but it hasn't been working until now. 

He texted me today his information for an account he set up with Byte for me and asked me to take over the payments on it. If you don't know, Byte is a company that sells aligners for teeth straightening. Let me just put it out there that I never asked for this product, and was very comfortable with my body and appearance, but he wasn't. One of the reasons we broke up was because he was always criticizing my weight, teeth, and just body in general. No matter how much I told him it hurt me, he would tell me I was making a big deal over nothing and that he was just trying to encourage me to ""better myself"". He bought me the Byte aligners for Christmas, even though I told him that he didn't have to buy me such an expensive gift. I've been struggling with money since I've been trying to pay off my debts, so I wasn't able to get him anything super expensive like that. He insisted, and got them for me anyway.

Now since we are broken up, he is asking that I pay for the rest of it and he is trying to make me put in my card information on the account. Now that I am paying the whole rent by myself, I am not able to afford that payment. I feel that since it was a gift to me, I shouldn't have to pay for it. Plus I haven't even gotten my second set of aligners. I've tried contacting them about it, but haven't heard anything and it's been about 3 months. 

He can be petty in many ways as well as controlling. I'm worried that if I refuse to pay for this, he will try and do something to me, the apartment, my cats, or my stuff.

10,1d0q6d6,AITA for feeding stray dogs even though my family is scared.,"Hi. I'm a 16yo female that comes from a highly strict conservative family. I've always adored strays (cats and dogs). I save up on my pocket money to buy food for them in order to feed them daily.

My parents are separated. My grandfather provides for my mother and our family while my uncle provides me with my pocket money. I live in an apartment building and both my grandfather and uncle reside in the same building.

I am currently feeding 3 stray dogs regularly. As a result, they have started to wait for me day and night in the building's surrounding area. Any person that they think is me, they immediately gather around them. The society members have not raised any complaints against it.

However, my uncle has. He said that his daughters (he has two adult daughters and one has a newborn baby) get scared of the dogs because they surround them when they're walking with the newborn (they do so once a week).

I argued that those 3 dogs are strays, and they also will run away if you even lift a finger at them. They are scaredy cats. My uncle asked me to feed them outside the society's gate and I agreed. However, he is now telling me to stop doing that as well because they follow anyone they think is me.

My grandfather sided with my uncle and told me to stop feeding them as well.

I still want to continue feeding them and I have been distressed about it. I don't want to be disrespectful to my elders so I have kept quiet about it, and have tried to feed them in secret.

11,1d0ptby,AITA for parking in front of my house?,"I (22f) was coming home from a coffee run this morning and got into a little ""argument"". I live on a side street next to a private high school, and on Saturdays they often have a ton of sports games. On especially busy days, people will often park on the side streets rather than parking in the parking lots, as my street is closer to the fields where the games are played.

I park my siblings' and I's shared car on the street, as our driveway is taken up by my parent's cars. I usually park right in front of my house, and as I turned into my neighborhood and saw how packed the street was with cars, I was worried my spot would be taken. It wasn't taken by a car, which relieved me, but rather a middle aged woman standing with her arms outstretched.

I put my blinker on and rolled down my window as I got in front of my house, and the woman asked me ""parking for the lacrosse game?""

Before I could say ""no"" she cut me off, saying, ""I'm saving this spot for my sister, she's just a minute away but I saw this spot for her so I told her I'd save it.""

What she said next still makes me laugh. She gave me a smile and said ""I know the family that lives here, it's my best friend's family."" She pointed to my house.

I DO NOT KNOW THIS WOMAN. She clearly thought this lie would work on me, but her smile dropped when I told her, ""I live here, this is where I usually park.""

She began to argue with me, saying she was saving the spot because it was right next to the lacrosse field. I told her she could park in the parking lot, and she told me to park somewhere else. My street was filled with cars at this point, so ""somewhere else"" would have been the next street over.

Despite how angry I was, I told the woman, ""Please move, I'm parking here and I don't want to hit you."" She crossed her arms and started cussing me out, especially when I put the car in drive and started parallel parking.

12,1d0pgmy,AITA for making a one-off gibe at my brother’s girlfriend’s fake boobs and fake nose after her and my brother insulted my Hinge matches?,"I [22M] went hiking with my brother [27M] and his girlfriend [25F] yesterday. I told them 2 weeks ago that I just got on Hinge. My brother asked me about how that was going while we were on the hike. I showed him my matches and a few noteworthy conversations. His girlfriend seemed interested too as I was showing them the stuff on my phone.

After showing him 3 conversations, he asked me why I’m wasting time chatting with ugly girls. I asked him if he was busting my balls or if he really thought they were all ugly. He said those 3 are ugly and told me to show him a hot one out of my 30 other matches. I showed him one who I felt was pretty hot. He said that she’s like a 6 at best and asked his girlfriend what she thought. His girlfriend said “no comment” with a smirk.

I didn’t appreciate that arrogance out of her. My brother kind of pissed me off a bit, but his girlfriend pushed me over the edge. She teases me sometimes and seems to have an inflated ego, but I have never heard her put down another girl’s looks before. What really makes that worse is that she got a boob job and a nose job last year. Sure, she might be considered LA hot now, but I felt like I needed to check her ego.

I said that at least none of these girls I matched with have “more silicone than brain”. My brother’s girlfriend isn’t that dumb. That was the first gibe I could think of. I read that on an online forum a few years back when a user commented that phrase on a thread with photos of a plastic-looking model and I always thought it was funny. This was the first time I used it in real life. I tease my brother’s girlfriend sometimes too, but never about her appearance. I don’t like going there. She’s usually cool with my teasing.

However, this time, both my brother and his girlfriend were triggered. My brother told me that was super low of me and to never talk to his girlfriend that way. His girlfriend said that she didn’t even mean to imply with her “no comment” comment that she thought the girls were ugly, just that they were not as pretty as I probably thought they were. I said “sure” in a dragged and disbelievingly tone. She said I had the privilege to continue simping over these girls if that tickled my pickle. I told her I will. The rest of the hike wasn’t as bad as I had thought it was going to be. We were able to get back close enough to how it was before.

Later last night, my brother called me. He said that he shouldn’t have ragged on my matches the way he did, but also said that I shouldn’t have said what I said in retaliation. I told him that he’s right, but that he needed to check his girlfriend’s ever-inflating ego. He asked me what I was talking about. I said that she’s displaying more bitchy tendencies every time I see her. He didn’t even ask me to elaborate.

Lea continues by saying that when she sits down she gets a tummy, that she hates that and wants to loose it. I told her that’s totally normal that we have organs and that’s why we have a small pouch sometimes when we sit.

So much that, about a month and a half ago, I decided to move out of where we were living at for my son’s and my own peace of mind. It was a very stressful and toxic environment that I did not want us to stay in.

My son’s birthday is this Monday and, since my ex and I were not in such really good terms when we separated, I made plans to have a small celebration with two of my girl friends from work and their kids (5M and 3M). 

About two weeks ago, my ex said he regretted his actions and wanted us to try again. I was hesitant because I didn’t want to fall in the same pattern again but I can’t deny that I would love for us to be together and be a family again. 

I told him about the plans for our son‘s birthday and he always seemed to get upset about it because he said he also wanted to be part of it, but I told him that I really wanted to stick to the plan since he and his family hadn’t given me any other options either. He later suggested going to a water park the day before, so the 3 of us could celebrate and I agreed to that since I thought it would be fun. 

Today we got into an argument because last night I sent him a picture and a video of when I was pregnant because I was very emotional and he didn’t reply back until later today and didn’t mention anything about that at all. When I told him I was upset that he didn’t even acknowledge what I had sent him, he blew up and started saying that he did see it, he just ‘didn’t know what to respond to that’ and that ‘I always do this to him’. What he meant by that was that I share my feelings and want to talk about it when I’m upset. 

So after that, I don’t really feel like going to the waterpark anymore and would rather stay home with my son and wait until Monday to celebrate with my friends.
