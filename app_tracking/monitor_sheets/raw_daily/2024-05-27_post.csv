0,1d1i31m,AITA for not supporting all the choices my daughter made over her wedding weekend?,"My daughter, Anastasia, got married a week ago. In the months leading up to the event, she was understandably anxious, which her father and I tried to help her through as much as possible.

Originally, Anastasia planned on having a wedding weekend. She married on a Sunday but wanted everyone there that Thursday to kick off the weekend with a few activities. Most guests were coming from across the country. First, she changed the welcome barbecue to basically just cold cuts and chips, even when her dad and I offered to buy the stuff she originally promised. But she said no. Then she cancelled all the activities and said she was too stressed to do any of them. She said it was nothing the family did, just her stress. While I understood her side, I did also understand the side of her guests who were upset they spent all this money to come early, have accommodations for a full weekend and now, they had very little to do.

Then, a few members of the bridal party who had flown in out of state with plus ones stated they felt bad for their partners for basically abandoning them. They ended up skipping a few events because Anastasia had told them to treat Thursday and Friday as a vacation then took that back and expected them to ignore their partners.

Anastasia was pissed and began venting to me. I tried to be understanding at first. Eventually, she only had myself, her maid of honor and one bridesmaid attending a movie night she arranged. The bridesmaid ended up leaving early because she felt bad her partner had basically been cooped up in their hotel alone (there really isn’t a ton to do around here). She and the other bridesmaids promised they’d be there for the sleepover they had always planned for the night before the wedding so everyone could get ready together morning of.

After this, Anastasia threw a fit, saying she felt abandoned by most of her bridal party. Her maid of honor was reassuring her that she did the right thing and they were being assholes. They both looked to me and my husband for support. Eventually, I said I understood her bridesmaids. I also understood why our family was upset. While it’s understandable she’s stressed and why she didn’t want to do the originally planned events, she did cause a lot of people to waste money and time coming down here. As well as put her bridal party in an awkward position.

Anastasia refused to discuss it more. The rest of the weekend went on as she wanted. The wedding was beautiful and everyone had a good time. Then Anastasia and her husband went on a short honeymoon. They returned on Friday and we had dinner on Saturday. At one point, Anastasia confronted me privately and said I was wrong for not supporting her. She said I was supposed to be on her side. I said I would’ve been but she was teetering on bridezilla territory. Just because it’s her special day doesn’t mean how she handled things was okay.

She insists that I was in the wrong for not backing her up. AITA?

1,1d1hnr5,AITA for telling my wife she’s gatekeeping my time when it comes to our kids and her emotions?,"Before we go into the situation, I (33M) own my own company, but the job requires me to be away from home for weeks at a time. When I am home it’s usually only for 4-5 days before leaving for work again. My wife (30F) is a SAHM who is often overstimulated and who just recently started her own small business. Now on with the situation.


So my wife text me this evening saying I may want call my daughter tomorrow and talk to her, because she’s had a rough day. According to her my daughter was tired our two boys were fighting and this caused my daughter to become upset and start crying for me. My wife being overstimulated didn’t let her call me so she could talk to me.  When I asked why my daughter wasn’t able to call me my wife responded with “I was overstimulated and just wanted them to go to sleep.” 

When I read the word “overstimulated” I called her.  My wife’s love language is affirmation and I’ve learned that calling and giving her words of affirmation helps her calm down. We talk for several minutes with me telling her how great of a job she’s doing with the kids and with sales at her business. Because honestly she has been doing great with keeping the business up and holding down the home front. Then she asked, “are you mad that I didn’t let her call you?” I said “no but it does upset me when I find out one of my children was literally verbally crying for me but wasn’t allowed to call me.”

This caused her to blow up on me saying I don’t know what she goes through on a daily basis because I’m always gone for work and that she feels like I don’t respect her feelings as much as I do our children’s feelings. So I brought up that this wasn’t the first time she’s done this and asked her how it would make her feel if one of the kids were crying for her but weren’t allowed to call her. She again said I wasn’t considering her feelings. So I asked her why she doesn’t let them call me if they’ve been “bad”. And she replied “I’m hanging up now. I don’t appreciated being told I gate keep my kids phone time with their dad as a form of punishment or that your not respecting that I didn’t let her call because I was overstimulated. Call her in the morning.” And she hung up.

I never once downplayed the fact she was overstimulated. I just pointed out that I don’t want my kids to EVER feel like they can’t call me, when they need me to talk to them after a bad day, because it might cause someone else to be upset. So AITA?

TL;DR my wife didn’t let my daughter call me when my daughter was upset and is now mad that I implied she gate keeps their phone time with when she’s overstimulated or trying to punish them.

2,1d1hls1,AITA for telling my friend to stop talking about his culture so much.,"I (18M) have a friend ‘Adam’ (18M) who is very out spoken about his culture and ethnicity. He is a Louisiana creole who speaks French as a first language, and he is extremely proud of his culture especially since he claims it’s a dying ethnicity. The only problem is sometimes it gets overbearing. He’s often making posts in French and the Louisiana creole language, he’s always talking about his French ancestors, he listens to creole music very very often, he talks to himself in French, he’s always talking about this history of Louisiana creoles and the colonization of Louisiana. Like ok we get it you’re creole. I was starting to believe that he was obsessed with his culture, and thought lower of me for not being creole since he spoke so highly and proudly of his ancestors. I’m Puerto Rican and I’m proud of my culture, but never to the extremity that he was. He always taught us stuff about his culture and Louisiana when we didn’t ask for any of the knowledge. Well one day I kind of lost it. We were having dinner with some other friends, and he started talking about a certain creole dish. I immediately stopped him and told him that nobody cared that he was creole. I told him that everyone just thinks he’s a lightskin black man, and to stop talking about his culture because it’s annoying. He was astonished and quiet for a minute then he responded with “Imagine if there was 10,000 Puerto Ricans left on this earth. Let’s see how you’d feel about your culture.” He didn’t even finish his dinner after that. He stayed quiet for 5 minutes and then he got up and left. My other friends at the table told me that I didn’t have to say that and I was being TA. I haven’t heard from Adam in a week and we use to talk everyday.

3,1d1hi4d,AITA for being indecisive about whether to attend my best friend of 15+ years wedding? ,"I 27 F, just started an intense 2 year healthcare school program. However, my bestfriend (we have been bestfriends since 6th grade) 28F is getting married on a Sunday this year. Basically, I just started this intense schooling program where more than one absence can get you expelled. I have waited 4 years to be accepted into this program and finally was accepted this year. My best friend, we will call her Emma, lives in a separate state (about 1,000 miles away), she is getting married on a Sunday later in the year. My school is Mon-Thursday 8 am- 4 pm.

I am her maid of honor and am expected to attend her bridal shower which is months before and is on a Saturday, which is no problem considering I have a full day to either fly or drive back home to make it to school the following Monday. 

Her wedding will be held at 3 pm on a Sunday and I am expected to be in class at 8 am that following Monday. The wedding venue is one hour from the nearest airport and driving would take 14 hours and flying would only take 3 hours but, if I miss the last flight out or god forbid my flight gets delayed/ canceled, and I miss school, I could get dismissed/ expelled.

Am I the asshole for considering not attending? (Keep in mind she is totally understanding about the whole thing) However, I just don’t know if my feelings/ anxiety about missing school are valid enough to miss her wedding. And I need to make up my mind soon so she can make the proper arrangements to replace me and add another bridesmaid. PLEASE give me your advice, I am desperate. Thank you

4,1d1hfg2,AITA for telling my husband not to drive my cousin home from work? ,"


My (29F) husband (30M) and I were friends since we were born so he was always around my family and everyone considered him another member, except my cousin. She (28)always had a crush on him and it was noticeable to everyone, I mean she was pretty obvious because they kissed a few times and she declared her love for him but he didn't reciprocate, and when we started dating at 18 she got depressed and stopped talking to me for weeks.  

Long story short, she got over it and started dating several men and even got married, and when that happened she moved close to us and wanted us all to be friends again like when we were kids but I don't feel comfortable with that because she doesn't give me good vibes. And the last straw was that she asked my husband if he could pick her up from work for a few days since her car is damaged. She asked him that because her job is close to his and he told me because he wanted me to tell him what to do because he doesn't feel comfortable with her either. So I told him no, and she told me that the Uber will cost too much money and I told her I'm sorry but my husband has to pick up the kids (8F, 5M, 3F) from school and if he picks her up he'll be late.

It was a pretty lame excuse but I hoped she would understand but she didn't, and she got angry and told me that I was being inconsiderate of my own family and that it was selfish.

5,1d1h8a9,AITA for not helping my depressed brother?,"I, (14 F) have a brother, (12 M) who I will call jake. While we don't have much in common, I would say that we are fairly close, and have a pretty good sibling relationship. Recently, however, me and my dad have been noticing him feeling down and overall demotivated, which my dad decided to diagnose as depression. My dad, fully believing he is depressed, talked to me about it to try and get me to help him by cheering him up, hanging out with him, etc. Often, I am busy with school and tests, but I try to be nicer and hang out with him more while being normal.  
This weekend, we were up at our upstate house as we have the long weekend and we have a pool there, my dad asked me to take jake to the pool and hang out with him to make him happier. The only problem being, is that, I have severe self-image issues and the only bathing suits at the house are 2-piece ones I last wore when I was 10, and it is horrible enough to try to fit into them to see if I even still fit, let alone be in a pool with them with people watching me. I am also extremely insecure about people looking at or touching me, etc. especially when I have less clothes on for personal reasons. My dad is unaware of this and I know he is unaware, nor am I keen on letting him know, however, I did tell him that I was not comfortable with getting in the pool for personal reasons and I was just overall uncomfortable with even the idea of it. I have said this many times before including mere hours before he asked me to join my brother in the pool. When I told him no repeatedly and stated I was uncomfortable with being in the pool, he didn't say anything except ""depression is a really scary thing and I'm worried for him"" with a look on his face that looked weary and slightly frustrated with me. I am aware of how dangerous depression is, seeing as I have had it and kept it hidden for 5 years. I am well aware that my brother may have depression and I am trying to help him however I can, and, while at the time, I thought that it was fine to not do it as I felt uncomfortable, I'm wondering if I'm really doing the right thing, putting my needs before his own.

6,1d1h70k,AITA for not inviting my friend to my wedding?,"I am getting married at a destination wedding with a very small group of guests—24 guests to be exact—which my family and closest friends will be attending.

My fiancé’s family won’t be attending our destination wedding for reasons that won’t make a difference; however, my fiancé and I are having a small lunch after our registry at a local restaurant for family and a couple of friends who are not attending our destination wedding.

We have communicated with some of the friends months prior to the invitation, mentioning the lunch is for those who won’t be attending the ceremony and reception overseas.

More than half of the guests for the lunch are family only. My friend Amy and her partner were invited to the lunch as they couldn’t go overseas. My friend Sarah was not invited to the lunch as she had RSVPed for the overseas wedding a few months prior.

Here is where the problem begins: Sarah got extremely upset with me because she wasn’t invited to the lunch even though she was going to the actual overseas wedding.

I texted her, called her, and apologised. It was never my intention to get her upset because of that, and I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. If my fiancé’s family was attending our overseas wedding, this lunch wouldn’t even be happening.

I was able to get a spot at the restaurant for her; she said she wasn't sure if she would be able to attend as she might be working. Sarah has a great job, is financially stable, works two weeks per month, and has two weeks per month off.

Sarah messaged me a few days ago and told me she won’t be attending the overseas wedding anymore as her financial situation is compromised for X reasons. I said it was fine, and I understood if she couldn’t come as it's overseas and not everyone can go. I met up with Sarah and Amy two days after Sarah told me she wouldn't be coming for the overseas wedding, and Sarah was showing me that she bought this expensive handbag and pair of shoes (let's say those two items would have cost at least $10,000).

Yesterday my other friend Lana started organising my bachelorette party, and I messaged Sarah, asking if she would be able to attend and, if so, to share her schedule so Lana could organise something that was easy for Sarah. Sarah said to not get worried about her dates because she will most likely be working extra shifts.

I called Amy to ask if she knew if Sarah was upset with me because she hasn’t said anything, but it looked like she didn’t want to attend any of the events. Amy said she didn’t mention anything about being upset, but she wasn’t making me a priority when I didn’t prioritise her at my wedding. She was invited to the wedding but not for lunch as she was already going overseas. Amy asked her if Sarah was going to, at least for lunch, and she said she would be travelling overseas with her friend and she wouldn’t be changing the dates because of me and that I am not a good friend.

Amy asked her if Sarah was going to, at least for lunch, and she said she would be travelling overseas with her friend and she wouldn’t be changing the dates because of me and that I am not a good friend.

Our friends had a cookout today to which my girlfriend and I were invited. We had to leave the cookout party early to pick up our cat from the vet. However on the way to the vet I realized we left our lawn chairs and my high noons at the party. I asked my girlfriend if we could pick up the cans before we head home with our cat. She wanted to go straight home as our cat hates car rides and vet told us to keep him unstressed. I agreed but asked if I could go get the cans right after we get home because I didn't want anyone to drink them. My girlfriend was okay with me leaving but then asked if I would pick up pretty litter before I went to grab my cans. I was pretty irritated at this because I don't think we need pretty litter. We could just look to see if the litter is moist. Furthermore it would be out of my way to grab the litter, bring it home and then get my cans. So I called her selfish for not valuing my time and how long it would take me to grab the cans and return home. Then I left to go grab my cans. She called me in hysterics for calling her selfish and not helping separate the cats and getting them set up with their own litter, water and food  in their own rooms. I felt she was being dramatic as I was going to be home in less than a half hour to help her. I told her she was being dramatic and she accused me of caring more about my high noons more than helping her. I felt like I have nothing to apologize for and I was being honest that she was being selfish and dramatic. Am I the asshole?

8,1d1gt5u,AITA for not taking weight loss advice from my friend that lost 40lbs on Ozempic?,"I (25F) have been friends with Jackie (25F) since our freshman year in college. Jackie has been overweight for as long as I’ve known her. I’ve seen her struggled with her weight a lot, and in college, she was constantly going on fad diets and then quitting. However, last year, she went on Ozempic and started eating less because the drug made her feel ill. Combined with light exercise, she has lost over 40lbs and looks incredible. 

Recently, I’ve gained a lot of weight that I’ve been trying to lose. Jackie is understandably proud of her weight loss and has been trying to give me advice about how to manage cravings and losing weight through CICO (calories in, calories out). I’ve been listening to it because she’s really passionate, but I haven’t been taking it. This wasn’t an issue until she noticed me taking advice from our mutual friend, Louisa (27F). Louisa has been relatively thin her entire life, but over the past few years, has gone from skinny-fat to building a considerable amount of muscle. I have been actively texting her for advice and copying her protein meals/workout routines, especially since she has my dream physique. 

Since I started taking Louisa’s advice, I’ve been steadily losing weight. I hyped up Louisa’s gym routine and meal planning to basically all my friends, saying how great I’ve been feeling and how her tips have really helped me. This led to Jackie asking me why I was taking Louisa’s advice but seemingly none of hers. I tried to make up excuses, but she didn’t believe me. She told me that we’ve been friends for so long that I should respect her enough to tell her the truth. Eventually, I said that because I was trying to lose weight naturally, I wanted to take advice from someone who also achieved their physique naturally.

Hearing this, Jackie got really mad. She said that I was discrediting all the hard work she had to do and that Ozempic wasn’t a miracle drug. She said I was judgemental and that she had genuinely good advice if I was open minded enough to listen to it. I feel bad for hurting her, but at the same time, I think she’s making a bigger deal out of this than she should be. I wasn’t judging her for taking Ozempic, but she wasn’t able to lose weight without it in the 7 years that I’ve known her. I just wanted to take advice from someone with a healthier relationship with food.

I've been lucky to have a sucessful career in Tech the last few years whereas she started off wealthier in her career (and recently sold a house to buy a new property) but has chosen to follow her passion (less lucrative as a ceramist). We've been not as close the last few years with us living in different cities and I've tried a ton but she often says shes bad with keeping in touch if people aren't in the same city, this has left me feeling hurt but I've tried to understand. I got married towards the tailend of covid so our dream wedding venue (5 star hotel) gave us a huuuuge 70% off discount on a wedding so we thought why not do it! It ended up being quite flashy which we were a bit embarassed about given we're both from humble beginnings. My best friend said she would like to make me something and I was really excited. At the wedding (I was mostly distracted being the bride) she seemed quiet and not herself. She isn't into fancy things and looks down at anything she perceives to be capitalism or materialistic. She didnt seem happy for me at all and wasn't her usual happy-go-lucky life of the party which bummed me out a bit.

After the wedding, she said all the right things but she never made me a ceramics pieces and she was the only guest to not give anything to our honeymoon fund. It's been 1.5 years and it still bothers me. Its also on top of struggling to stay close (me trying one way) and her not seeming to care much about me.

12,1d1gj0k,AITA for attending a Memorial Day pool party but not church,"I (18F) was just recently put on birth control two weeks ago. As I’m sure all of you know, birth control comes with a laundry list of side effects, especially when your body is first acclimating to the hormones. One of those side effects I have been cursed with is debilitating nausea and vomiting.

My father (43M) is extremely religious and has forced me and my siblings since birth to go to church and adhere to its absurdly strict modesty rules. The only time we are really allowed to miss church is due to sickness or travel that is out of our control. (I, while also religious, don’t agree with the doctrine of the church we currently go to and will be looking for another one once I move for college. My dad doesn’t know this.)

Anyway, today was the usual routine. Get up, get dressed, and go to church. We get there and I am hit with a wave of that terrible nausea that has been haunting me for the past two weeks, so I run to the bathroom and throw up. Afterwards, I find my dad and tell him that I need to leave because of said vomiting episode, and he lets me. However, our pastor’s wife (We call her Bobo because she’s literally one of the sweetest people ever) overheard and before I hit the door invited me to a little pool party for Memorial Day that she was throwing at her house after church, and that she was praying for me to feel better so I could make it, and she bought me some pineapple to have at the party since I am allergic to watermelon (see told you she’s the sweetest). I told her I would take some medicine and rest and try to be there if I’m feeling better by then.

Cut to after church. I took some medicine and felt better so I got dressed and went to the party. I ran into my dad first after getting there and he asked what I was doing there. I told him that I was feeling better and Bobo bought me a pineapple so I was there to eat it and have a good time. He then blew up and told me to go home because he would not allow me to skip church and only go to the “fun stuff”, and that he has a reputation to uphold and that allowing his kid to do that looks bad. (Ik there shouldn’t be “reputations” when it comes to church but unfortunately that’s how it is at ours)

Now here’s where I might be TA. I told him that I don’t care about his reputation and that I was going to enjoy myself and entered the party anyway. I did enjoy myself but my dad made himself scarce.

However, I know what it’s like to be judged by a church. Bobo may not judge but that doesn’t account for the rest of the church. (I’m a bit of a black sheep in not only my church but also my family). So I understand if you have a good reputation with the church, why you would want to uphold it. No one likes to be judged, but you know they will.

13,1d1gg2m,AITA for not talking much during my old friend's marriage?,"I'm writing this because I need some unbiased point of views about it and I'll use fake names for privacy. Some days ago, I (21F) traveled along with my parents for an old friend (20F) marriage, Hope. We used to be close when we were kids but we lost contact and didn't talked at all for almost a decade, but our parents remained friends. There wasn't any fight or drama between us, she just moved far away and we lost contact.



Her family is religious and in their church, if you're dating, you have to marry asap. She started dating last year and now has married. The point is my behaviour during the traveling days made my parents get angry at me. I'm not a very talkative person, I'm more introverted and sometimes, it's hard, it's like I have to prepare myself before talking. I do talk with my close friends, but Hope and I aren't friends anymore to be honest.



I'm not saying it in a mean way. We just didn't talked for almost a decade and we grew very different. The problem is both our parents didn't seem to understand this and started to basically demand we hug and talk. We tried but we don't have much in common. I also don't like being touched, especially frequently, and I know her mother didn't mean any harm, she's a wonderful person, but she touched me a lot, kissing and hugging me all the time and I just kinda froze. She also wanted me to eat a lot and I just couldn't (literally) but my parents continued to enable her to make me eat even when they knew I was about to throw up.



I've talked with them about it when we were alone and they said they were angry at me for not being happy and that Hope's mom was just being nice which I don't disagree in the last part. After it, they started to compare me with Jane's (their other friend) son, saying that they should marry us and, because, I quote, ""the two of you are anti social weirdos"".



For context: Hope's mom, Jane and my parents are all friends. Jane's son, Ed, normally doesn't talk much to people and hides in his room. He never got therapy for long enough for a diagnostic but it's said he might have PTSD and depression due three robberies some years ago. He never really got the right treatment and still suffers with the trauma, but everyone, even his parents, downplays it.



In the wedding's night, I didn't talked much, altough I tried and prepared myself to try talking. When Hope talked with me, I shook her hand and congratulated her in a low tone of voice. We just talked for like 2 minutes because she had to talk with the other guests. When we got alone, my mother got furious at me saying I barely talked and I embarassed her so much it k-word her out of shame. My dad also said he was disappointed and that I need to learn how to communicate better.

14,1d1gfog,AITA for telling my friend I can’t go to a concert because I have to work,"Here’s the situation, my friend (21 F) sent me (22 F) links to two different concerts in February, one of the concerts took place in March (we went, I drove, and it was fun) and the other one is in June. At the time, nearly 5 months ago, I only bought tickets for the one in March and did not have the money for the one in June, so I thought I would wait. We recently bought tickets to another concert and she reminded me about the one in June, but I had completely forgotten as it was so long ago. I’m scheduled to work on the day of the concert (I work two jobs I need all the hours they’ll give me). When I told her that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the concert she was really upset. She is mad that I made a commitment to this months ago and now I’m saying I can’t go.

when i (now 16) was 13, i came out as nonbinary to my very religious mother. she screamed at me for three days before i gave up trying to convince her to accept me and moved in with my dad. the day after i left, she sent me multiple texts calling me a horrible person and said i was a pos just like my father. 

over the past three years we’ve had fights but things have been getting better. she invited me to watch a movie with her and my brothers to bond today, so i came. we had a minor fight when she tried to insist that my black friend’s dad was a criminal when i told her that he had been pulled over unfairly the other day but i let it go.



after when i was waiting for a ride back to my dad's, i put on a show i like where the main characters are brothers. it was fine until she said one of them was cuter, i laughed and said they looked the same to me because i don’t like men. she tried to show me the difference, saying one of the character’s foreheads were akin to that of a ""monkey"" or ""neanderthal."" my little brother and i told her that was rude, but she and my stepdad defended her by saying it wasn’t harmful because the actor didn’t hear it. we both tried to tell her that those kinds of comments are in poor taste anyway.

she then tried to say my comment about them looking the same was like saying all black people look the same, which i denied, because it was about my own sexuality, not the subject’s race. she then said it was sexist against men which i also denied, and she asked if i was saying you couldn't be sexist against men like i say you can't be racist towards white people. this made my stepdad (patriotic type) join in, and i tried to explain to both of them how racism goes further than just mean words.

at this point my mom was bawling and my stepdad said i should shut my mouth because she’s my mother. i tried to explain that i’m a human who should be able to express my thoughts but my mom said i couldn’t say that, claiming i left her house because she had opinions on my gender that she didn’t like. i told her that my identity, which she has no right to control, is different from political opinions.

she stormed out of the room then and said she was never going to invite me over again. i screamed at her that she was being immature and she screamed that i was my father’s daughter, and to call him because she wasn’t fucking taking me anywhere.

i blocked her because i have a tendency to convince myself i'm the villain in every situation and i'm expecting she will try to send me another barrage of texts telling me how much she hates me because that's become common of her when we fight, but without her telling me that i'm a horrible person i just don't fucking know what to think. it's been an hour and i've tried every coping mechanism i know, i still feel fucking terrified. so. am i the asshole? please be brutally honest, the last thing i ever want to do is hurt people and i can't bear the thought of unknowingly doing so to my own mother.

19,1d1furb,AITA for not fighting for us to get our cat back?,"My wife and I rented one half of a duplex for 4 years. In that time, we adopted our cat, Addie. A year and a half ago, there was a fire caused by someone on the other half of the duplex. The house was destroyed. We lost a lot, but luckily Addie was okay.

We temporarily moved in with my brother’s family. They were amazing to us. The kids loved Addie. 

It soon became clear that our landlord was going to have to tear down the duplex and rebuild as the damage was that bad. We needed to find a new place to live. After endless searching, we realized all the vacancies that we could afford in our area didn’t allow cats. My brother and SIL generously offered to keep Addie while we tried to get off the waitlist at a pet friendly apartment. In the past year and a half, we’ve visited their home frequently and have gotten to see Addie. 

To add, if it matters, my brother’s family began financially taking care of her. Including vet bills, food, etc. They refused to take our money. 

The more time that passed, I knew the odds of us being able to take Addie back were slim. My SIL works from home so Addie’s gotten used to someone being around. Whereas my wife and I work in offices in a different city. The kids were also growing more attached. I tried to have this conversation with my wife multiple times but she was in denial.

Last month, we finally got off the waitlist for a better apartment that allows pets. My wife instantly called my brother to ask about Addie. He asked that we meet with him and his wife for dinner. 

As I expected, they asked if they could keep Addie. They said they had grown attached to her. That the kids would have a hard time but they felt Addie would too as she’d gotten used to them and their lifestyle. I have to admit, Addie does seem happy there.

My wife started to protest but I said we’d think about it. At home, I told her this was for the best. She got pissed and said she wants Addie back. That we had a deal. I said we need to think about what’s best for Addie and also what’s fair to everyone.

Ultimately, she reluctantly agreed. We still see Addie, but my wife acts different when we’re there. Sometimes I feel she resents my brother and his family for keeping Addie. But she won’t discuss it. Recently, a friend asked if we’d ever get another cat. My wife said no as she feels I’d just give it away again. I was hurt and said I never would’ve given her away if not for the circumstances. She made it clear she’ll never understand my choice.

She didn't interest me at first and there was no way I was going to approach a new student. We actually grew closer after I asked for a pen via one of my friends.

We shared everything but had very apparent differences. She was the talkative extroverted person and I was the quiet introverted one, I liked reading and didn't like trends while she was more into watching movies and was aware of everything on the internet. After some time, we exchanged homemade gifts for our birthdays.

I noticed something was off with her and she seemed sick. She ghosted me for hours and only responded to my messages when I gave her the homework but I decided to brush it off thinking that she'll come talk to me if she needed to. When she was online, my friend was too: the one who asked for the pen years ago (that friend was very social with others but seemed to only like me sometime and hate me when they didn't get better grades than me. I think it was because of the pressure since we both had stricts parents. I'm kind of a straight A student)

I noticed she was avoiding me at school and only spent time with my friend. I started to spend more time alone and was getting jealous of all the attention my friend was having from her. When I tried to enter their conversations, they would always switch topics and left me aside during breaks but my friend's bestfriend decided to keep me company. I knew from my friend's face that it didn't please them at all. My bestfriend's birthday was near and I was preparing a necklace. I gave it to her Tuesday since her birthday was Thirsday.

I found the exact same necklace hanging around my friend's neck the next day. I confronted her about it and her sole excuse was: she wanted it so I gave it to her. I snapped. I just yelled at her for ignoring my existence 4 months and ghosting me just to hang out with someone else without telling me if something actually bothered her. She shouted at me accusing me of not caring about her feelings, saying that her grandfather was in poor health how she was stressed at home and I was a bad friend to not care.

I decided to not engage a converstaion with her anymore after that because of the guilt I felt. I still got an invitation to her birthday but I refused to come to the party. The drama extended but with the rumours about me, most sided with them. I had the solid proof with message and everything but didn't do anything because I didn'tI want bad things to happen to her. The rumors got worse accusing me of betrayal and how bad I was to her. The worst part is that my friend kept telling her bestfriend to not approach me, told her I was toxic and every friendship I had got ruined because of me.

She was the talkative extroverted person and I was the quiet introverted one, I liked reading and didn't like trends while she was more into watching movies and was aware of everything on the internet. After some time, we exchanged homemade gifts for our birthdays.

I noticed something was off with her and she seemed sick. She ghosted me for hours and only responded to my messages when I gave her the homework but I decided to brush it off thinking that she'll come talk to me if she needed to. When she was online, my friend was too: the one who asked for the pen years ago (that friend was very social with others but seemed to only like me sometime and hate me when they didn't get better grades than me. I think it was because of the pressure since we both had stricts parents. I'm kind of a straight A student)

I noticed she was avoiding me at school and only spent time with my friend. I started to spend more time alone and was getting jealous of all the attention my friend was having from her. When I tried to enter their conversations, they would always switch topics and left me aside during breaks but my friend's bestfriend decided to keep me company. I knew from my friend's face that it didn't please them at all. My bestfriend's birthday was near and I was preparing a necklace. I gave it to her Tuesday since her birthday was Thirsday.

I found the exact same necklace hanging around my friend's neck the next day. I confronted her about it and her sole excuse was: she wanted it so I gave it to her. I snapped. I just yelled at her for ignoring my existence 4 months and ghosting me just to hang out with someone else without telling me if something actually bothered her. She shouted at me accusing me of not caring about her feelings, saying that her grandfather was in poor health how she was stressed at home and I was a bad friend to not care.

I decided to not engage a converstaion with her anymore after that because of the guilt I felt. I still got an invitation to her birthday but I refused to come to the party. The drama extended but with the rumours about me, most sided with them. I had the solid proof with message and everything but didn't do anything because I didn'tI want bad things to happen to her. The rumors got worse accusing me of betrayal and how bad I was to her. The worst part is that my friend kept telling her bestfriend to not approach me, told her I was toxic and every friendship I had got ruined because of me.

It actually hurted. When I didn't show up at the party, more whispers were heard in the hallways.

Am I a bad friend for not supporting her even after she told me about her situation?",2.0,1.0062214,1,0

25,1d260d0,AITA for 'stealing' 30$ from my parnets?,"When I was 16, I was working for a coffee shop. I made decent money and some tips that would get me through the week when my employers started to cut my hours. I was making a lot of change from this which added up to about 30$. I had been putting them in an old cider jar I had gotten while shopping. However, about two months before I had quit my job, my mother noticed that her change jar was looking pretty empty. She had accused me of stealing the change from her because I had so much in the jar. 

My stepfather on the other hand had never been able to keep a job for long. He would always quit and he barely made enough money to help sustain me and my mom, but also his three other kids he had in previous marriages. He never really had enough money to do fun things like go out for ice cream with his son or take me and my stepsister out to the skating rink when we were younger. But once my mother's money had started going missing, he all of a sudden was coming to take me to school with a bunch of food wrappers in the car. Everyday there would be a new container from quick-star or some fast food joint. He sometimes even bought my step brother dinner just because, even though he knew my mom had made dinner beforehand. I had started to connect the dots and realized that the missing money must have been stolen by my step father. But when I confronted him about it he got defensive and said that it wasn't my business what he does because it's his house, he's my dad and he's an adult. He is an adult and I was a minor then but he had never really been my dad or helped out my mom enough for me to consider him to be even partially the owner of the house. I wanted to tell my mom about this to clear my name but I do have a history of lying about stupid things like eating ice cream or taking a drink I wasn't supposed to have- which I totally get.

But when I begged my mom to give me back my money everything kind of blew up. I told her that her husband was an abusive lazy freeloader who doesn't take care of his kids properly and that he's a terrible person.

I also told her about the names he was calling me and how I felt unsafe with him whenever he got mad. She told me that I was ungrateful for everything he had done for me and that I should leave those things in the past. I then told her that he was stealing the money from her and then she called me a liar. I said some things to her that I regret now like saying I hated her which was entirely untrue.

This one girl, Abbie, never spoke up even when I specifically asked her. I didn't know her well but wanted to include her, but she would just mumble and not give a definitive answer. Eventually we settled on korean food.

There were few people in the group who weren't too familiar with the food so I explained the menu. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food and I thought that was that.

Towards the end of the meal, Abbie started whining about the food. She didn't like this, she didn't like that, she was unfamiliar with the food, she couldn't even ""choose"" the restaurant. Few people reminded her that I specifically asked her where she wanted to eat and it was a group consensus.

I asked Abbie why she didn't speak up earlier and she responded she didn't want to upset anyone. My tone turned harsher and said ""well you could've said something earlier instead of whining and causing a scene now. Why bring it up at the end of it if you didn't want to cause trouble?""

I'm autistic and sensitive to noise  and he cranked the speakers up. I asked him if he'd mind turning down the volume as it was hurting my ears .
He tutted and kept asking if I was pissed w him. 
I said no and he kept telling me to tell that to my face during the movie.
I apologized.
At the end of the movie he seemed in a bad mood and I asked if everything was ok. He said just felt I didn't like his speakers and was taking away from his experience. I said I was sorry and would do my best to get used to it .
He said people are fed up with all the requirements I make and need about noise, lights and other things . I just feel so awful because I didn't mean to ruin things ",0.0,-0.01298163365572691,0,1
33,1d24u4k,AITA for kicking my brother out for making our house a biohazard ,"So me (15 Male) and my older sibling (27 Nonbinary) have recently connected with our brother (16 Male). We have been getting to know each other after separation and he has been in a pretty bad living situation so we had offered our house to him to stay in for as long as he needed. He asked how to earn money around the house, he made a lot of promises to help out around the house with us, including cleaning up after himself. But after a few weeks we had noticed absolutely no progress or help within the house. Things were messer and messer and then he would lie about helping. So one day we had dropped him off at his family’s house for the weekend, when we got back home we had realized that we should clean up his and ours mess because our roomates were due to be home soon. We had started on the kitchen and we were making very good progress until we saw a suspicious bag right next to the sink under some dishes. We had picked it up to see what it was and apon opening it we found out it was shit. Literal human feces. We both almost threw up because of how badly it smelled, we tried to not drop the bag and in that process we stepped in some of it. To preface our brother had been very sick a week before and he had an accident where he shit himself. We both scrubbed the kitchen for hours trying to get rid of the stench, meanwhile crying because of how unbelievable the situation was. Now we thought that was the end of it but when we tried to clean upstairs where he had been sleeping we found a trashbag and it had fallen over, we found a ziplock bag filled with a semen like substance. ON TOP OF THAT, we were cleaning our bedroom and found a jug of piss. Which he had been sleeping in our room aswell. He had “cleaned up” after he shit himself, he told us he took a shower but his hair was literally never ever wet neither were any towels, which leads us to assume he just slept in disgusting shit all night. 

In result of this he is not allowed at our house for the time being, we had also taken back the phone we had given him prior because he had not cleaned at all whatsoever, he had agreed to those terms however. He understood that no cleaning means no phone. We know it was not our roomates because they are not here all month, only for a few days every month.

34,1d24dao,AITA - For fighting with a friend ,"Okay. So long story. My best friend and I got into a fight a few days ago. We both did edibles and I ended up falling asleep pretty early on the couch. 

I woke up a few hours later.. i over heard my best friend talking on the phone to her BF. I thought they were making fun of me bc I heard my name in a conversation where I was hearing insults.

 When I got back from work we got into a big fight about it. I told her I heard her and her bf talking about me. I handled the situation really badly. I got upset and said “this feels like a break up” and she got her BF involved into the fight (which I didn’t like) 

Apparently I misunderstood and they weren’t taking about me. She left the house which I didn’t realize bc I was on the phone to cool off. 

So I sent her a text and asked if she could talk. 

She came back and we talked and  apparently she didn’t like how I was acting while she was crying.

Context about me ( I’m bad at handling emotions. Since we were fighting pretty bad.. I like to think about what I say so it doesn’t make it worse) we talked then hugged 

Then I told her if I ever think there’s miscommunication I will talk to her about it instead of jumping to conclusions 

hung out the rest of the day I thought we were good. 

The next day she sent me a text telling me she doesn’t know how our friendship would be the same ever again over this fight. 

Which I took ownership I messed up and I shouldn’t have jumped to that conclusion. 

Now she is saying “thought you were my family guess I was wrong”
And saying other things I find hurtful. 

She is telling me she is just being honest and she can’t view our friendship like it was. 

I’ve apologize multiple times over and over again. I took ownership for the fight and my short comings  in all of this. I’m not sure how to fix this but I wanna try am I the asshole ?

35,1d240bm,AITA for asking our babysitter to set alarms when she sleeps?,"My wife and I(34) have three children ages 7, 4 a 9 month old. I work a demanding job(in the medical field) and work many many hours, my wife not so much but she does have night shifts often. We just got a new babysitter a few months ago after our one we had for 2 years moved for college.  Our new babysitter is only 16, but she had been babysitting one of my coworkers children for awhile and I trust him. 

A few nights ago my wife and I were both working nights and I saw on the camera that our babysitter was asleep on the couch and the baby had woken up was crying for almost 30 minutes while she slept. That bothered me, so without talking to my wife when I got home in the morning I had told my babysitter maybe she should set alarms throughout the night to make sure she’s awake since the baby monitor didn’t wake her and that it was not okay for her to leave the baby crying like that.

 I guess it hurt the kids feelings because she mentioned it to my wife and my wife is really upset with me because “she’s only 16” and what I was asking is unreasonable and that this has never happened before so again I’m being unreasonable and that I should’ve talked to her first because this could’ve been a “learning experience.” She also said I was completely out of line as well.

37,1d23x7j,AITAH? Mum / daughter arguments ,"Ive (27F) have been butting heads with my mum (49F). 
Context, growing up I relied on my family as I was unwell. We’re with each other all the time.
Shes been tracking my phone for yrs and whenever I leave the house rings me to ask where I’m going. I’ve turned it off but it’s caused arguments and she keeps asking me to put it back on.

I found a partner (33M) mum introduced us 1yr & a half ago. He has 2 kids 4F & 7F. 

Fast forward a few months and Pam has now started making comments about my partner and how he’s not good enough for me, she doesn’t like how he parents his children etc. its got to the point now that when the kids are here she always looks for them misbehaving to tell them off. She’ll leave sweets on the side and then tell the kids off for “stealing” because they’ve taken one. Makes sly comments, saying I’m glad they’re not my grandchildren, shall we go out and get some peace and leave my partner to deal with them etc. 

Shes started moaning about my partner using the deep fryer she got him as a present! 
Moans about the washing up (partner cooks every night for us all and either him or I wash up) Moans that I don’t talk to her. We’re with each other 24/7 there is only so much you can talk about! 
Moans about me and my partner going to bed after dinner (he works 14hrs a day 5-6 days a week so it’s the only time we really get together) saying I don’t spend time with her. 
Moaned that I went out with my partner for 1hr and I didn’t give her a kiss bye.

We’ve just found out I’m pregnant with twins!
We’ve been talking about moving out. Pam keeps saying how my partner can move out and I can stay here with the kids, she says it’s a joke but with all the other things she says it doesn’t feel like it. All I get is you won’t be able to cope with 2 kids by yourself. Even when he’s home he won’t step up. How I would be better bringing the twins up without my partner.
She keeps saying my babies as in hers.
She’s got everything and I mean everything for the twins. I haven’t even had chance to get anything myself or be included in any of it. 

The day we found out the twins genders, My partner and I went to open the envelope. My partner screamed happily. We come downstairs to tell Pam, she didn’t even smile, didn’t look at me, just blankly said congrats. She didn’t like this. Saying I took away a moment from her that she thought we would share together.

Pam’s gone to my nan to moan about all of this so my nan ends up moaning at me, saying things like I won’t be able to cope, I need Pam to be able to cope etc. my partner won’t be any help to me. I’ll be left with all 4 kids. What am I gonna do if I’m ill with the twins, etc. They even moan at me if I have a lay in.

38,1d23txo,AITA for refusing to pay off my boyfriend's overdraft?,"I've known Ron as a casual acquaintance for a few years, but we started dating about two weeks ago.  I'm 19 and he's 20.  He has a full-time job and only pays his mum £40 a week for bills/food.  His only other expense is his car.  So he has a lot of disposable income, but he doesn't save, he blows it all on nonsense like gadgets that he then never uses again.  So much so that he's overdrawn by £2K.

I'm a full-time student who babysits on the side, and I'm frugal.   I've managed to save £3K.  It has taken me about 2 or 3 years to save that.  Tonight I mentioned that some friends of mine are going on holiday in September and I am going to join them.  Ron asked me ""How will you pay for that, you don't have a job apart from babysitting.""  I said ""I have £3K in savings, so I will just use some of that.""

Suddenly Ron got a really calculating look in his eyes, and just outright asked me to pay off his overdraft.  He said he would pay me back £200 a month.  I said he should just pay off his own OD at £200 a month.  He said ""But then I have to pay interest!""

I refused to lend him the money for several reasons:

1. He's such a spendthrift I don't believe he would pay me back.  If he can't set aside £200 a month to pay off his own OD, he is not going to set aside £200 a month to pay me back.

2. I earn a small amount of interest on my savings.  Why should I lose that to save him interest?

3. What if I have an emergency, or an opportunity like my upcoming holiday?  I then  won't have any money to pay for it.

And I didn't say this one to him, but also I don't want to lend him the money because he has such a bloody cheek.  I know we've casually known each other (friends of friends) for a few years but we're only really just now getting to know each other properly and I just think it's such a rude and selfish thing to ask.  It's really made me see him in a different light and I don't like what I'm seeing.

This summer, I decided to get a job and not take any classes so that I could purchase my own things and not upset my parents by asking for money. My mom has a bad habit of telling people about my business because she's, I guess, “loud and proud,” whatever that means. 

I honestly am an introverted and to-myself kind of person, even with extended family. I wouldn’t say I hate them, but I feel like I just tolerate them. I don’t have anything against them, but they constantly talk about my appearance, and in my culture, it’s wrong to talk back to adults. Plus, I’m not too fluent in the language since I’m first-generation American and mostly speak English, whereas they’re learning it as a third or fourth language. I genuinely plan to keep a minimum of contact with them as soon as I’m able to avoid them more often because I’m practically forced to spend holidays and events with them. 

That’s just background info, though, so anyways, I’m getting a job soon, my first, and I of course told my mom. I only told my parents, sister, and one friend because I didn’t want anything to possibly sabotage my chances, and my sister agreed with me. 

So I’m at my aunt’s house for the weekend, and she mentions my appearance, specifically my weight.

Arlo is at least 14 years old, but there’s no way to know for sure because Arlo was a rescue 10 years ago for my wife, while she was in another marriage. This dog is a menace. Arlo refuses to pee or poop outside and instead has filled our basement with his excrement. It doesn’t matter how many times a day we put him in the back yard or take him for a walk, he will only go in the basement. 
Arlo breaks at least one dish a day trying to get human food. We try so hard to put things out of his reach but somehow he keeps figuring out how to get at dishes. We also have 3 little kids, age 7, 5, and 3 that will leave food in places Arlo can access. 
Arlo makes more mess in the house than the 5 of us people combined because in addition to the pee and poop issues, Arlo has figured out how to open closet doors and get into the trash, dragging trash throughout the house every day and also getting into the cat litter and spreading it all over the house. 
We took Arlo to the vet about a year ago for a checkup and the vet said Arlo had really really bad periodontal disease. In the year since, Arlo has lost most of his teeth. I have suspected seeing blood in his poop when cleaning the basement, but my wife thinks it’s just “something he ate that was red.” 

My wife’s argument is that she feels that it is wrong to put a dog down because of behaviors and because the dog is an inconvenience to us. Arlo still has a lot of energy and no mobility issues. My wife wants us to try using dog diapers again (we have tried and given up on the diapers more times than I can keep track of) and to try blocking off the basement so Arlo can’t go down there. I am convinced that the dog diapers will not work and I think if we block off the basement, Arlo will just pick a new spot in the house and it will be worse because he will ruin our hardwood floors. I told my wife last week that I was done helping her with Arlo and that I would no longer do anything to help her take care of the dog, including cleaning up any messes the dog makes around the house. If she thinks it’s too much, or she can’t keep up, she can get rid of the dog. We’ve been fighting constantly for the better part of a week over this. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: We take it for a minimum of two walks a day. We have tried training, we dropped it off with a trainer every day for a month last fall.  We have tried diapers. Spending hundreds of dollars on dog diapers and trying different brands/fits. We hired a dog walker/trainer to come in the middle of the workday to take him out, we tried deterrence sprays that are supposed to stop dogs from going to the bathroom in certain spots, we tried puppy pads, we tried a artificial grass type mat that is supposed to help. Nothing works. The amount of poop /pee this dog generates is unnatural. We tried putting it on a more controlled diet, but that made his aggression in going through the trash and trying to get human food worse. 

My wife refuses to consider either solution of rehoming the dog or putting the dog down. I am certain that I am seeing evidence of internal bleeding and that he is sick. My wife refuses to even take the dog to the vet to confirm that. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-27,"AITA for wanting to put down my wife’s dog?  I think it’s time to put down my wife’s dog Arlo.

42,1d2337n,AITA for not taking my boyfriend's dislike of Spaghetti-O's seriously?,"Hello! My boyfriend and I (both 35M) have been together for about five years. He's a little bit of a fussy eater, and in general I do most of not all of the cooking in our relationship.

I regularly make pasta dishes and he's completely fine with eating them - he even says that my pasta bake is his favourite food. One food which he absolutely hates is Spaghetti-O's - they're not really an important food to me so we just don't buy them.

I went and bought the groceries for the week and happened to pick up some Anelli pasta so I can make pasta bake, his favourite dish. For those who don't know, Anelli pasta is hoop-shaped like Spaghetti-O's. As soon as he saw me putting them away in the cupboard he got really annoyed at me, and asked why I bought them knowing he had an issue with Spaghetti-O's. I said it's not the same thing, it's just dried pasta with the exact same ingredients as the other shapes of pasta he eats every week.

He said he's been very clear that it's a food he won't eat, and he wants me to go out and buy a different type. I said I know he doesn't like Spaghetti-O's, but maybe if he's eating his favourite meal he won't notice them and it might help him get over his issue with them.

46,1d22ow3,AITA for asking my Fiancé to do drug tests while supporting him to get clean?,"I recently found out my Fiancé has been taking coke regularly for at least a year. We have 2 kids and drew down on our mortgage last year. 

I found out because I was applying to skip a few months mortgage payments. To do it, you need to both submit bank statements including app banks like Venmo. I had been suspicious of his spending and behaviour for quite a while. I’ve found empty bags in the house but he said they were casual (which I don’t mind). Another fight about money last week sparked me to comb through his statement and the transactions were all there. I confronted him and he confessed to taking it regularly (it’s been 4.5k worth since March) 
 we’re only recently drawn down on the mortgage and have 2 kids (one of them is very new) I asked him how he could jeopardise all of this. He broke down and said he would stop - that he would do whatever he had to. 

I’m not stupid enough to think someone could go cold turkey without any problems. I told him that he was free to take all of the rest that he needed. (I looked up withdrawal symptoms and his big one seems to be over sleeping) I also asked him to talk to me, that I expect wobbles and struggles and I’m here for him. Every time I ask him how he’s doing he rolls his eyes and tells me to stop asking. 

This past weekend I got suspicious. His movements were a bit shady which isn’t important. What’s important is that I quickly realised that I had lost all trust in him. I asked him today if he’d be willing, just for a couple of weeks, to allow me access to his statement to see where his money is going, and to take some drug tests for no other reason than to reassure me because his word just isn’t enough anymore.

His reaction was really bad. He blurted out flippant come-backs like “what’s the point of this relationship if you don’t trust me”, “what, like you’re my Mam?’ And “i’ll actually do a drug test so I can LAUGH at you”. 

If I didn’t suspect it before asking, I definitely do now that he’s on a come down - there’s no need for such defensive behaviour. But is it that unreasonable to ask him for those things just for a few weeks? I’d get it if we didn’t have kids or joint assets but we do so I need to think of that above anything else.

My maternal grandfather passed away about a month ago and my entire family (mom, dad, and 2 younger brothers) flew back to my mother’s home country for the funeral. I, unfortunately, could not go as I’ve only recently started a new job. I wasn’t particularly close to my grandfather so I wasn’t too upset about staying behind. 
My family was gone for a total of 22 days and we FaceTimed and stayed in constant communication during their trip. I think it’s great that my mom got to reconnect with family and that my brothers got a chance to meet everyone.

My birthday was last Friday (2 days) after they got back. TBH, I wasn’t expecting more than birthday wishes from everyone, but the day past without a word from anyone. Was I annoyed? Sure. But I wasn’t too upset. I’m not the biggest birthday person. I ended up having a nice birthday dinner with my boyfriend and a few friends. 
All hell broke loose Saturday afternoon when I got a really angry phone call from my dad. I guess my boyfriend did a special IG post for me and my brothers saw it and showed my parents. I had no idea he did this as he isn’t a big poster. Anyway, I could hear my mom crying in the background while my dad laid into me saying that they were sorry they forgot, but not saying anything and then posting about it online was passive aggressive and mean. I told him that I wasn’t upset and that I didn’t think a 33rd birthday was that big a deal anyway. He said a few more things before abruptly ending the call.

My sister, Sally (F32), got me (f21) a job at the restaurant she was working at last spring. I am attending university 7 hours away, but I spend the breaks at home. This is my second summer working at this restaurant. I work as a cook n she worked front of house as a server. The chef before the current head chef, Pete (M53), was an avid user of coke. The current head chef is Car (M32). I was really close to Pete. Car and my sister are close; it is rumored that they were caught together in the walk-in a couple times, but from my knowledge, they never actually did anything. She quit a bit ago.

This situation happened on a Thursday night. The night prior there was a very heated argument between two line cooks, and this really stressed Car out. He wasn't there for the fight. One of the cook that got into the fight was working, and he kept going off about the situation. Car isn't the best at controlling his emotions. He is a really nice guy and has never made me uncomfortable at work before this situation. Apparently, Car thought it would be a good idea to get absolutely wasted. He yelled in face and ordered me around like a child.

 He apologized to me and I didn't forgive him. This cause Sally to EXPLODE. She starts yelling at me saying I would've forgiven Pete for this and just because it is Car that is why I don't forgive him. In her exact words from a couple days later she says ""You're the one that was completely okay being all lovey with a guy on cocaine all the time who was your boss but one bad day for Car and hell breaks loose \*eyeroll\*"" I said many things around the lines of ""hop off of Car's dick"" and saying ""By defending him to me doesn't make her chances of fucking him better."" Eventually, she wouldn't let up and just kept yelling, so I told her to mind her own fucking business and I don't have time of this stupid shit and continued to eat my soup.

When we got home, she left for her boyfriends. I was concerned for what she would have texted Car, my boss, so I decided it would be best to text him about how I truly felt honestly. We had a long convo and made up mostly.

Basically, Sally is saying that she never yelled at me in the car nor did she ever defend Car. She thinks I need to apologize to her for shutting her out and ""not"" telling her what happened. Sally has also stated that she is friends with my boss and if that upsets me, there is nothing she can do about it. When responding to the fact he scared me, she just said ""If he made you feel that way then just leave. Don't know why you would still work there if he made you feel that way.""

49,1d22369,AITAH for asking my sibling for payment for the weed I sold her?,"So, my friend grows and sells marijuana. I started buying in bulk from him last year to sell to close friends and family that don’t easily have access to herbs. This has been a great side business for me, but I’ve had several problems with my sibling (21F) when it comes to making a business deal. My price is $30. My sister asked if she can get weed for $25 instead because she’s family and I agreed. However, after I give her the weed she walks away and goes to her room without paying me. And when I ask about payment, she usually ends up pissed at me, says I’m rushing her/doing too much and then eventually sends payment days later. Other times, she’ll text me for weed and after I give it to her she’ll just send over $20 instead of the agreed $25. I’ve never had this issue with any of my other customers. They ask for weed, I give it to them, they give me money, end of story. 

Last night, I was hanging out with my sister and some friends and she wanted to buy $60 worth. Of course, I give her the $50 discount price and when I woke up the next morning I realized I never got the $$ for the weed. I text my sister a reminder and she sends over $45, not $50. When I asked for the additional $5, she yells at me and says I’m making a big deal over “5 measly dollars”, that I need to grow up and I’m a bad business owner.

Today, I got the opinion of a family friend about this and they told me that, because she’s my sister, she may be expecting me to be lax regarding payment and that she may not have the money to pay the full price and doesn’t know how to communicate that to me. They said communication on both parts is bad. But in my opinion if I’m giving product in full I’m expecting payment in full. And not days later. Do you think I’m the AH here?

51,1d21wc5,"AITA for ""shutting"" my Sister (F32) Out After She Screamed at Me (F21) Over a Situation at my Work?","Before I get into this story, I would like to provide some background information:

My sister, Sally (F32), got me (f21) a job at the restaurant she was currently working at last spring. I am attending university seven hours away, but I spend the breaks at home. This is currently my second summer working at this restaurant. I work as a cook, whereas, she worked front of house as a server. The chef before the current head chef, Pete (M53), was an avid user of cocaine and other drugs. (This is relevant to the story I promise.) The current head chef is Carmen (M32). I was really close to Pete, and we got along well, but Pete and I have always been a little tense around each other. Carmen and my sister are extremely close; it is rumored that they were caught hooking up in the walk-in a couple times, but from my knowledge, they never actually did anything. My sister left her job about 6 months ago, and she tried to come back, but they didn't have any openings. This is also a small mom and pop diner, so there is no real ""head hancho."" (I apologize if this is poorly written, I am flustered right now.)

This situation happened about a week ago on a Thursday night. The night prior there was a very heated argument between two line cooks, and this really stressed Carmen out. He had Wednesday off, so he was not there to fully understand the situation. One of the cook that got into the fight was working, and he kept going off about the situation and telling Carmen he had to fire the other cook. Carmen has a lot going on in his life, and he isn't the best at controlling his emotions. He is a really nice guy though and has never made me uncomfortable at work before this situation. Apparently, Carmen thought it would be a good idea to get absolutely wasted. I am unsure what he was drinking, but he was severely intoxicated.

Carmen was so drunk that he was having issues preparing food for the customers and even started stumbling. He was extremely upset and stressed, so he began to take his anger out on the staff. I had just finished a long rush of tickets, so I was drinking my water while standing off to the side. Carmen sees that I am standing around, and he bellows over and gets in my face while yelling at me for not sweeping. (There is only one broom for the kitchen, and one of the waitresses were cleaning up a dropped plate.) When I tell you I was genuinely afraid because this drunk man was screaming in my face, I was shaking. The rest of the night he kept making passive aggressive comments to me and interrupting everything I had to say. At one point, he yelled across the kitchen on how I needed to stop being useless and go grab him something from the back. The entire night, the entire kitchen was on edge. When he finally left, I WAS LIVID.

My sister is friends with the host that was working that night, so she was invited in after to close to sit and catch up with Sam (f40). I went out to my sister, and I started complaining to her and telling her everything that Carmen did that night. A few of my other coworkers followed suit. Another cook and I were having a conversation in front of her about how although life is hard for us, we still have to get up each day. (A bit of background I was placed into foster care at age 12, never got adopted and aged out. I am completely financially independent etc. This cook just got out from a 25 year prison sentence.) Nothing much else happened that night besides we were on commenting on what happened and how we worried if Carmen ended up making it home that night ( he lives about 25 minutes from the place.)

The next day, I came into work (I need money, okay, I can't just quit.), and Carmen was there. It was a a pretty normal day, but I went out of my way to not engage with him. I still respected his orders as my boss, but I did not want to be personable with him. I think he noticed this because he pulled me aside later on and apologized for his actions the night before. I didn't say anything besides a ""I appreciate this."" My sister was picking me up this night because my car needed a alternator. When I got to her car, I was holding a soup cup and spoon from the restaurant. My sister asked why I took it with me, and I said I wanted to finish my soup and if the head chef can be drunk at work then it shouldn't matter if I took a small bowl and spoon. By this point, I could already tell she was apprehensive about something, and she explained that I shouldn't be stealing from work. I now understand that was something I shouldn't have done. After I went off about that, I asked if Carmen had come and given the same apology speech because apparently he had left a few questionable voicemails. She said yes, and I was like yeah he did the same to me, but I don't forgive him.

This cause Sally to EXPLODE. She starts yelling at me saying I would've forgiven Pete for this and just because it is Carmen that is why I don't forgive him. In her exact words from a couple days later she says ""You're the one that was completely okay being all lovey with a guy on cocaine all the time who was your boss but one bad day for Carmen and hell breaks loose \*eyeroll\*"" I definitely messed up because while she was going on this rant, I said many things around the lines of ""hop off of Carmen's dick"" and saying ""By defending him to me doesn't make her chances of fucking him better."" Eventually, she wouldn't let up and just kept yelling, so I told her to mind her own fucking business and I don't have time of this stupid shit and continued to eat my soup. 

When we got home, she left for her boyfriends. I was concerned for what she would have texted Carmen, my boss, so I decided it would be best to text him about how I truly felt honestly. I explained that I think he is a very passionate cook and I looked up to him, but after this incident, it has changed. I thought it was extremely unprofessional for him to get that plastered while working and that something much worse could have ended up happening (him cutting or burning himself badly or even crashing and killing himself or someone else on the drive home.) I have also been extremely open to him about my brother's addiction because I have had to miss work to get him from jail, the hospital, and help take him to rehab. Carmen said he understood why I was upset, and that he was truly sorry and he was going to start therapy and try to get back on his medication. He also promised that there was going to be change in the kitchen, and he really did want to lose me as an employee. We have since talked in person, and we are working towards becoming friendly again. 

Sally, on the other hand, I have not made up with. Since the incident on the ride home, I told her I appreciated her picking me up, but that I would rather find other ways to commute home. I have also not talked to her since because I am waiting for her to apologize first (immature I know, but I am sick of her acting like everything is about her.) I explained to her that I am upset because she got involved in a situation that had nothing to do with her (she was not in the diner when this happened nor in the kitchen), yet she still went on to share with Carmen everything anyone said at the host stand that night. This has caused backlash on me because coworkers are coming up to me and asking why she is trying so hard to involve herself in this issue. A few other reasons I am mad is because she is trying to invalidate my feelings because she thinks I am only upset because it was this person and that I shouldn't be mad at his little mistake. She also stated that I should apologize to her because I got upset that she was defending Carmen and his actions without sharing my side of what happened. (even though I told her the night before at a celebration for our other sister's engagement along with a few other close family members.) 

Basically, Sally is saying that she never yelled at me in the car nor did she ever defend Carmen. She thinks I need to apologize to her for shutting her out and ""not"" telling her what happened. Sally has also stated that she is friends with my boss and if that upsets me, there is nothing she can do about it. When responding to the fact he scared me, she just said ""If he made you feel that way then just leave. Don't know why you would still work there if he made you feel that way."" (I am currently seeking other employment, and I have an interview Friday.)

I am hurt and angry because she is trying to make herself the victim in the situation. She wants me to apologize because I didn't provide enough information for her to make a full judgement, but I just told she needs to stay the fuck out of my business. I recognize that she got me the job, but she no longer works there, and even if she did, she doesn't control the relationships I have with my coworkers. That fact that she would rather take the side of the man who drunkenly screamed in my face than her sisters hurts me. I don't care if she wants to be friends with him, but based off of this and her denial and lack of ability to take accountability for anything she said to me the night, makes me not want to speak with her. She is now arguing that she never yelled or screamed at me in the car: ""You can say I did but I know screaming and yelling and I sure as hell didn't do that to you. But whatever."" The fact she thinks she did no wrong is making me question if this is a person I should even continue to have a relationship with. 

Why I would be the asshole?: I was very rude with what I said to her for defending her friend. I also have multiple times told her she needs to stay in her own lane and mind her own fucking business. As well as I refuse to apologize for anything in this situation because if she wants to be treated nicely, she should not scream at me for something she knows nothing about. 

She is my sister and has helped me a lot when I needed it. I love her so much, but this argument has made me see a totally different side of her. So, AITA for shutting my sister out until she apologizes? And if she doesn't, would I be the AH for not initiating contact until then?

52,1d21k92,AITA for choosing to separate myself from my family when we have family dinners?,"So when we have family dinners, I (19F) choose to go upstairs or outside when the talking begins. The main reason is because when I do join the conversation they act like im invisible or just completely disregard me. For example we could be talking about food and as soon as I say something I usually get talked over. It’s not like they don’t hear me, they (especially my mom) act like im not there. 

Another situation happened where I had just got a new macbook because my other one was stolen. I was walking up the stairs and my brother tried to snatch it. Everyone got mad at me except my grandma bc I held on it tight and I got upset. I told them, if he would have asked to see it I would have let him. But as I’m walking upstairs don’t snatch it because it could have fallen and broke. I was yelled at because I always had a attitude but my grandma stepped in and told them they’re wrong. I can admit that I do have attitudes sometimes but when I don’t like something and I get a attitude when I told them I don’t like it but they still do it. Another example is I don’t like being touched above my shoulders, I don’t know why but I can’t stand it. I expressed that I don’t like it and for my brothers to please stop. Usually I will deal with it because they’re playful but our last dinner I got fed up with it and got mad. Anytime I get mad or express I don’t like something it’s either that im stuck up and can’t just joke around. but I dont like those jokes😕 

I understand that siblings always joke around I’m fine with that but that’s one of the things I CANNOT stand. 

Today we had another family dinner and I expressed to my grandma how i feel after she kept calling me a introvert because I go upstairs or outside. I told her why (which i’ve already explained why) and it’s because I’m ignored or always talked over. I’ve gotten to the point where I really don’t care to engage in the conversations. And every time, everyone has something to say and I am tired of repeating myself. 

So AITA? 

update: yesterday’s dinner was sh!t. my brothers did respect my boundaries which was a win win. it was my sister, which we don’t get along anyway (long story). However I didn’t go upstairs, I did go outside but not upstairs. I mainly tried to stay downstairs with everyone else. The same thing happened again tho, i did take yall advice about the conversation starters but they didn’t work. I did sit back and listen to the conversations and tried to sit back. Overall: i am going to reflect on myself, express how i feel one more time, me and my sisters and I relationship was ruined",Not the A-hole,2024-05-27,"AITA for choosing to separate myself from my family when we have family dinners? So when we have family dinners, I (19F) choose to go upstairs or outside when the talking begins. The main reason is because when I do join the conversation they act like im invisible or just completely disregard me. For example we could be talking about food and as soon as I say something I usually get talked over. It’s not like they don’t hear me, they (especially my mom) act like im not there. 

Another situation happened where I had just got a new macbook because my other one was stolen. I was walking up the stairs and my brother tried to snatch it. Everyone got mad at me except my grandma bc I held on it tight and I got upset. I told them, if he would have asked to see it I would have let him. But as I’m walking upstairs don’t snatch it because it could have fallen and broke. I was yelled at because I always had a attitude but my grandma stepped in and told them they’re wrong. I can admit that I do have attitudes sometimes but when I don’t like something and I get a attitude when I told them I don’t like it but they still do it. Another example is I don’t like being touched above my shoulders, I don’t know why but I can’t stand it. I expressed that I don’t like it and for my brothers to please stop. Usually I will deal with it because they’re playful but our last dinner I got fed up with it and got mad. Anytime I get mad or express I don’t like something it’s either that im stuck up and can’t just joke around. but I dont like those jokes😕

54,1d20s4o,AITA for accepting job 6 hours drive away?,"I (late 30s F) had a job opportunity land in my lap. My bf (early 40s M) of 1 year thinks I'm TA for accepting it.

The situation:

I enjoyed my current job until the beginning of the year. Management changed, lots of experienced staff left, promises have been broken, and there have been H&S issues that aren't being taken seriously (one of which seriously impacted me to the point where I had to get therapy to deal with the aftermath). I was unexpectedly offered a job in a city 6 hours drive from here- I hadn't applied for it, the company contacted me directly based on my previous work. I initially turned it down, but they came back with a revised offer and clearly really want me. The new job offered a short probation period, hybrid working, a 32% salary increase (& shares in the company), and the location means I can live right on the coast.

The new city is one that my bf and I had been talking about moving to in future as we both love it. I have friends living nearby, and I used to live in the area. When this job came up, it seemed like kismet.

However, my bf flatly refuses to move. His parents are elderly (not sick, just in their late 70s. They still live independently in their own home but have poor mobility) and he doesn't want to move 6 hours drive away in case they need him. He currently visits them every Sunday (45 mins drive away). I have come up with compromises (e.g. paying for someone to come in a couple of times a week, travelling with him to see them every third weekend, paying a larger chunk of bills if he would rather work a 4 day week and travel down more frequently to see them, paying bills if he wants to go back to uni to do a Masters degree in the new city, moving his parents to the new city) and it's a resounding no to everything. He says he doesn't have anything else keeping him in our current city, and he would be happy to move once his parents are gone.

edit: he has asked me not to take the new job, and said that my current job 'is not that bad' so I should just stick it out and see if things improve. We both acknowledge that his parents could be around for 5+ years.

My job is quite specialised, so it would be difficult for me to find another job in our current city. His job is much more generalised.

We met in high school and all lived in a similar area. Recently, Jayleen moved and now lives much farther away from the rest of us. We all still keep in contact as we all value our friendship. 

Yesterday, Katrina had a graduation party for her little brother and invited all of us. However, Jayleen had a work event at the same time and couldn’t join us. She invited us to go since they allowed others to join, but since we knew Katrina’s family better than her coworkers, Giselle and I went to the party. We had a great time catching up as we haven’t seen eachother in a while.

 Afterwards, Giselle and Katrina wanted to get drinks with each other and I asked to join. They said yes and afterwards we went to Katrina’s house to have a girls night. Throughout the day, we weren’t on our phones because we were at the pool for the party and wanted to be off our phones to enjoy the moment and spend more time with each other. 

This morning, Jayleen was very upset that we spent time together and “didn’t invite her” and had sent a message explaining that to each of us. She was mad at all of us, but mainly me. Giselle had texted her the night earlier saying that she missed her and was trying to make the situation better this morning. Jayleen doesn’t blame Katrina because it was her brother’s graduation, so it would be bad if she missed it. I had done nothing on my part as we all contributed to Giselle’s message of apology. 

Now she’s texting me saying I’m a bad friend and that I haven’t been there for her when she needed me to recently. I have recently been struggling with my own things, so I don’t have the mental capacity to help someone right now. When she has texted me, I tried my best to help her as that’s what I do for everyone. I am also not that much of a touchy-feely person, so expressing my emotions and helping others can be hard to me.

I have already said I’m sorry but I’m not sure if she forgives me. I honestly don’t know what to do as this could mean losing a valuable friendship.

56,1d202tg,AITA for wanting to ask my roommate‘s friend out after my roommate rejected me?,"So I (23m) have 3 roommates. Over the past 8 months I’ve developed feeling for one of them, Maya (21f). We were pretty close friends and I couldn’t wait any longer and asked her out. She said she would need to think about it over Easter break, and after a month she finally said no.

I told her it shouldn’t affect the friendship because she’s a really great person, but I would probably need some time to get over it. I avoided her the next few days because I was honestly a mess, and she was a bit hurt by it. I sent her a message after she moved out where I wanted to clear the air, apologized for avoiding her, and she said the air is clear.

At the same time, I saw her friend Abby (22f) while I was waiting for the bus and we chatted for a bit. I knew Abby might be into me (she told maya she thought I was cute a couple of months back) and I thought she was cute as well. Since me and maya are back to being friends, I figured I would message Maya asking if Abby is single. She replied she think she might be seeing someone but she can check if I want to and I said thanks.

A few days later I was talking with my other roommate, Hannah, and apparently Maya told her about it and she thought it was very weird (Hannah thought my message was photoshopped because she couldn’t believe I did that). She told my I was an asshole because for weeks Maya seriously considered dating me and it seems inappropriate.

So, AITA?

Edit: a lot of people seem to take issue with me telling Maya how I felt. This post was about my other fuck up because I don’t think telling her was a mistake.

We’ve had a somewhat flirty friendship before I grew feelings and I felt it would be unfair towards her to keep it up without letting her know. She would ask for hugs, make a lot of sexual innuendos, and even cuddle once or twice. I thought it would be better if I was upfront with her and keep the friendship going whether I got a yes or a no. When I got a maybe and waited for a month to get a no, that’s when things got complicated.

57,1d1zvu4,AITA for having sex in my friend's room while subletting after she asked me not to,"TLDR at bottom, names have been changed

My (21M) two friends (Sarah 22F, Kate 21F) moved away for spring/summer semester and had to keep their apartment. To minimize costs for all of us, Kate offered to let me stay there for those semesters at a price cheaper than dorms so I accepted. I was to stay in Sarah's room but it was too cluttered to put my stuff in, had poor sunlight for my plants, and was overall the worse room IMO. I wanted to live a little more comfortably since I'd be there for about 4 months so I asked to stay in Kate's room instead.

I discovered that they wanted me to stay in Sarah's room because she didn't care if I had sex on her bed, but Kate didn't want any shenanigans in her room whatsoever. Kate is also very particular about a few hygiene things like not having ""outside clothes"" on her bed, not letting her plushies touch the floor, etc.; She agreed to let me stay in her room after I said I'll bring Sarah's mattress and put it on the floor instead of the bed frame, and also keep it in my pants while I was in her room.

My partner (20NB) usually stays over 3 days a week which both of them were aware of. One thing led to another and after like 2 weeks of trying to be respectful we ended up having sex there anyways. Now also keep in mind this was on Sarah's mattress which I brought into Kate's room. I also removed the mattress topper, layered a fitted sheet + thick winter blanket + regular sheet on top of it, and was careful to stay on the mattress the whole time. At this point we are having sex there pretty regularly as it's where we sleep. The only other places we could think of was the couch in the living room (which I think they would dislike even more) or running to the shower each time (lol no).

I understand that it was wrong, but I'm also paying to live in an already full apartment which was not cleaned before they left. Other than this issue I've been as good to it as anyone could ask. I cleared out the rotting food + garbage they did not throw out before leaving, deep cleaned the kitchen and bathroom, organized their storage room, saved their fish from a swim bladder infection by buying a new tank and equipment, taken care of their plants, etc.

I realize I feel guilty about breaking my promise and violating a boundary and am trying to justify it; but I think my point is that for the time being this is also my home. I've made good accommodations and treated their home respectfully, but I also deserve to live comfortably. I know should tell Kate but am wondering how realistic her request was in the first place, and whether I completely fucked up or made a reasonable but impulsive mistake.

TLDR is basically this last paragraph \^

EDIT: Just some extra info I should've mentioned but no I didn't intend to stay in that room and wanted to know the extent to which I was wrong, how forgivable that sort of mistake is, etc. We're also not exactly within the bounds of a legal or formal sublet, they don't know anyone else in the city well enough who both needed a place to stay and was ok with that sort of arrangement. I would've just stayed in dorms if the price they gave didn't save me 50/month. Their only other options were to either let a stranger live with all their stuff, or throw their money into a fire for the spring and summer.

I thanked her for the invitation, but I told her that I don't want to go to a party where I don't know anyone and where alcohol is allowed.

60,1d1zny7,AITA - Pet parrot causing conflict with neighbors,"We have a Moluccan cockatoo who has been with us for five years. We gave Peaches a home, because a family member couldn't keep him due to allergies and Peaches' was in bad health. (He was being kept in a cage all day and was feather plucking.)  

Peaches is now a completely different bird.  He's much happier.  He's stopped feather plucking entirely.

He now has lots of attention and out of the cage time.  We even built an outdoor aviary for him, so he can enjoy playing outside. 

This is where the ""AH"" factor might come in.  

New neighbors moved into the house across the street from us.  In April the mom knocked on our door, and said that Peaches is making too much noise and it is waking her baby up.  This happens when Peaches is indoors or outdoors in his aviary.  

We said we would make changes.  These have included:

  
1) We asked what the baby's schedule is and we don't let Peaches out during those hours.

2) We have added additional sound proof paneling inside our house.

3) When Peaches is loud, we discourage him from screaming.

The neighbors returned yesterday and said that Peaches is still keeping their baby awake and that he has to go. They said they'd be filing a noise complaint if we didn't get rid of him.

  
Other facts:

1) We let Peaches play in his aviary for about 2 hours each day and it is always supervised.  We don't just stick him in the aviary and go off and do our own thing. If he starts getting loud we try to distract him or we bring him in doors.

2)  He is never outside during early morning or evening hours or during the baby's nap hours.

3) It is hard to teach a cockatoo to be quiet.  

4) We live on a 1 acre property in the suburbs (not a town house or an apartment). None of our other neighbors have ever complained about Peaches.

5) It would be very difficult to rehome Peaches, especially since he is a feather plucker.   We are his third family.  When we got him, it was with the understanding we'd be his forever home.  He has grown very attached to us and I am afraid if he was rehomed, he would start plucking again.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-27,"AITA - Pet parrot causing conflict with neighbors We have a Moluccan cockatoo who has been with us for five years.

We were happy to help and despite not having alot of money ourselves we bought her a washer and drier for her new home. I called  to check in with her regularly and see how things were going and if she needed anything.  I know she changed jobs mid year and I wanted to make sure she'd still be ok financially.  She assured me she was good and everything was fine.  

We started noticing inconsistencies around Christmas when our credit score took a hit due to 2  late payments on her house.   Our daughter told us it was a mixup with the bank since a new bank took over her mortgage and she would sort it out.   A few months later it still had not been corrected so I called our daughter again. Something seemed off so I called the bank since my name was on the loan and found out my daughter was 6 months behind on the mortgage.  When confronted she said the new job wasn't working out so she quit back in December and hadn't been able to find a new job.  I thought this was strange since we taught her not to quit a job until you have a new one in place to be responsible.  I also asked her why she hadn't come to us and she said she was embarrassed. 
We gave her some leads on new jobs because we couldn't afford to pay the full amount she owed on the house at this point and suggested she get a roommate and if she could get those things done we would see what we could do.  

It was a couple of months before she found a job(I don't think she even looked into the leads we gave her) but still had no roommate to help with the bills.  At this point we found out from her grandfather that  she had taken a large sum of money from her from him during that first year (over 20k) and had just asked him for more but  he said he was sorry and  he didn't have more to give.   We still have no idea what she did with any of the money  and she never told us about this. Our daughter continued lying to us about paying the bills and has not done anything to help herself or save her home.  The mortgage company said they sent her documents for a hardship extension which she never returned. We finally made the decision to not take money out of our retirement (which was our only option since our credit scores were now in the toilet because of this and we can't get a loan) to save the house.  

This was not an easy decision to make, but we made it mostly because she had not tried to help herself at all and lied to us over and over again for more than  a year.

64,1d1z5af,AITA for expecting a frail old lady to help me stand up to a bum?,"Hey. English isn't my first language. 

This story involves 2 of my neighbors. Here's some background on them:

One of my neighbors is an older (70-ish) Lady, a widow. Very slight build, around 4'7 and 80 lbs, just to paint a picture. She is very kind and seems to have motherly/grandmotherly feelings towards me.  I treat her like I would my own mom/grandma.

The other neighbor  is a teenage escapee from a country that isn't safe to live in rn. He once asked to join me when I was doing my job because he was struggling for money. I agreed, and paid him after the job was done.

HUGE mistake on my part. From then on, he started frequently harassing me for money. He goes to extreme lenghts, such as calling me 7+ times on 6:50 am on a Sunday to ask for money. Unfortunatelly, my assertiveness is non-existant, plus there is a pressure in my country to put refuges like him on a pedestal, and I oblige each time.

This Saturday morning, I was set to take a train to a job site. I was having coffee at the elderly neighbor's house, after which she was supposed to walk me to the train station with her dog.

My phone rang and it was the escapee with another sob story asking for money. I just said I was going to the train station in a few, and to meet me down the street; we'd figure something out.

The older neighbor heard our conversation and was outraged; she started talking about how it is necessary to finally stand up to this guy. I figured this situation was perfect; we were going down the street together, and it is much easier to stand up to smebody when there is two people + the intimidating factor of the dog being with us.

However, as we went down the street and the guy approached us, the lady and the dog... just ran off. She literally jogged off, I could only watch their backs in shock.

Feeling betrayed, I quickly gave the entire contents of my wallet (minus my train fare) to the guy and left for the station.

The lady and the dog both waited for me there, the first thing that came off her mouth was ""what took you so long, you wanna miss the train to work?"" Which pi\*\*ed me off even more than I already was.

I said I hadn't thought she would leave me like this. That I had counted on her support and the intimidating presence of the dog to stand up to the beggar.

She was confused. She said she didn't want to be involved in this situation. She said that, had I been a kid, she would've helped me - but I was a grown man.

What immidietaly came to my mind was - ""well you're a grown woman, so maybe you should mow your own lawn, make your own firewood, shovel your own driveway and fix your own stuff.""

I didn't say that part out loud, but I still may be TA. She is right - I wanted to involve a tiny old lady in a confrontation between two men and that might have been unfair and selfish. On the other hand, there obviously would've been only a verbal confrontation between us, plus she was so outspoken about having to stand up to him just a few minutes before.

67,1d1yoij,AITA for changing topics after my best friend’s relative died?,"This happened about a year ago when “Gia” (16F) announced to me (16M), “Adri” (16F), and “Nat” (16F) that her aunt just passed. I privately DM her saying that I’m sorry for her loss and that I’d support her as best as I can while she grieved. She thanked me and that was the end of the conversation. About 30 minutes later, I messaged the GC about homework and I received a couple of cold messages from G about it. I thought it was odd but I moved on. The next day at school, “Gia” was acting strange and cold towards me and confronted me at recess while we were sitting with the rest of our friends. She said that it was rude of me to switch topics suddenly after she told us about her aunt’s death. I valued our friendship strongly, and even though I was a bit thrown off, I apologised immediately. “Gia” seemed to accept the apology and I thought that was the end.

Over the next week, “Gia”, “Adri”, “Nat” and another friend “Charlie” (16F) start acting coldly towards me, even leaving me out of a hangout sesh (I found out via Insta Stories). Then while we were having breakfast together at a McDonald’s, all of them sat me down and started confronting me about my “unacceptable” behaviour. They yelled at me that I was a “bad listener” and that I “never give good advice”, that I had “no understanding of personal space” and that I “treat them all like dogs”. I was extremely shocked and hurt at this and was about to apologise when “Gia” interrupted me and gave me conditions for an apology. Firstly, they would not be friendly towards me (hang out with me, eat lunch with me, talk to me, etc). Next, they wanted a deep and sincere apology by a certain date (that being that week’s Friday). I valued our friendship, and decided that I was going to apologise. I thought long and hard about it and I apologised in person to all four of them separately. I fell sick shortly after this, and I couldn’t go to school for a couple days. When I came back, my friends were still acting cold towards me and even my classmates and band mates were ignoring me. One of my classmates took pity on me and told me that there were some nasty rumours going around about me. I was shocked and I tried going to my friends for comfort but I was instead either ignored or outright yelled at. I really don’t want to say this but I think that they might have spread those rumours. I tried fixing the friendship but nothing worked and I feel extremely guilty about all this happening. 

So, to sum it up, AITA for changing the topic of my best friend’s relative’s death to something unrelated?

Kim is not the most considerate person, I’m pretty sure she suffers from mental illness. She doesn’t talk to us and just keeps to herself, which is fine because me and the other roommate are the same way.

However whenever we have tried to talk to her about sticking to our agreed rules, she gets angry and defensive. For example we have a rule where you have to clean up your dishes within 24 hrs. Kim will refuse to wash them for a week because “I’m a grown adult and have a job”, and when we being it up politely she gets angry and starts accusing us of bullying her. 

Kim slams doors REALLY hard. She slams her bedroom door (which is right next to the other roommate’s room) to the point where things are knocked off the wall. There’s a crack on the doorframe because of it. Even the downstairs neighbors have complained about it waking up their children. We have talked about this with her multiple times but she gets angry and says “I don’t realize I’m doing that.” I even suggested we can get those muffling things for her door, but she got angry and said we will regret it if we even touch her door. Other roommate has a heart problem so sudden loud noises like that make her very queasy and she throws up. Kim does not care. Kim for some reason DOES care what strangers think about her because when the downstairs neighbors yelled at her for it she became very self conscious. She didn’t change for long though. 

Me and my roommate decided to do this thing where we yell “STOP SLAMMING THE DOOR” or “JESUS CHRIST KEEP IT DOWN” or something when she slams it. When I’m talking to family (Kim is an eavesdropper) they hear the slamming and say things like “wow, what a crazy lady, she must have anger issues” or something. I have my phone on speaker and since she listened to my conversations she gets butthurt and quietly closes the door.

Kim finally told us she doesn’t appreciate us telling strangers about her problems. She doesn’t like being shamed for something she claims she can’t control. She also stomps like mad too which is why I know she’s standing outside my door listening. She said she’s going to report me and other roommate to management for harassment and (lol) invasion of privacy and get us kicked out.

71,1d1xae5,WIBTA if I deliberately didn’t go to my stepbrother’s birthday?,"Throwaway account + fake names cos of how personal this story is.

My (17M) parents divorced when I was 8 years old. Since then I have lived with my dad and, for the last 5 years, my stepmum who is an amazing person.

My mum moved to a town which is about a 55-60mins train journey away from my house. I usually go there during school holidays for usually around a week at a time. A few years ago my mum married another man, “Frank”. Frank has a son called “Noah” (14M). Noah is, for lack of a better term, a complete and utter brat.

All he talks about is himself, what Frank has bought him and how expensive it is. He has a tantrum every time something doesn’t go his way, which is both amusing and absolutely ridiculous considering his age.

There’s lots of other reasons why I don’t like the guy. For example, I write my own music recreationally. Since learning about this he has got Frank to buy him the exact same software as me. Now he just brags about how good he is at using it (when he isn’t), and tells people that the stuff I’ve already written is his own to make himself look better.

I also have a brother “Matty” (10M). He was born with really bad vision and can’t see without glasses. He gets picked on at school for it and that affects him a lot. He’s also autistic and isn’t great at communicating with people. Noah treats Matty like a dog: ridicules him for everything he does, belittles him, breaks his stuff etc. It’s gotten to the point where Matty cries before/during the train ride to their house because he doesn’t want to go.

I regularly confront both him and my mum about his behaviour towards Matty. But unfortunately for us, my mum always chooses to side with Noah instead of us. Even if she sees it herself. The sad thing is the relationship between me and my mum is getting worse because of it. Doesn’t matter that me and Matty are her actual kids, she still always takes his side. It’s to the point now that even though I still want to see her, we just end up arguing and by the end we hardly talk to each other. 

Anyway, Noah’s 15th birthday is coming up in late June, and my mum wants me and Matty to come to his “massive birthday party”.

For a bit of context, I work every weekend and I have to let my boss know way in advance the days I’m unable to work. So this would mean I would have to call in sick for an entire weekend, and then spend that weekend in another house an hour away, celebrating the birthday of my spoiled stepbrother who borderline abuses my disabled younger brother.

So now I’m at a crossroads. Neither me or Matty want to go, and I know my mum will be furious about it if we don’t go. However, the big issue I have is that if I refuse to go, I have a feeling that the relationship between me and my mum will get even worse. 

So I’m not entirely sure what I should do. My dad says we should go anyway, because it seems really rude if we don’t. But I’m at the point now that me and my brother really don’t want to deal with him anymore.

I (30M) am getting married to my fiancé (30F) next summer. We are an interracial couple. I am South Asian American and she is Italian/ multi generational American.

She wants to have an South Asian style wedding. Red wedding sari. Gold ornate Jewelry. A horse. Choreographed dance numbers. 3 days. A LARGE guest list. Every stereotype you can think of a South Asian wedding.

I (30M) am getting married to my fiancé (30F) next summer. We are an interracial couple. I am South Asian American and she is Italian/ multi generational American.

She wants to have an South Asian style wedding. Red wedding sari. Gold ornate Jewelry. A horse. Choreographed dance numbers. 3 days. A LARGE guest list. Every stereotype you can think of a South Asian wedding.

76,1d1v00a,AITA for demanding my older sister to return my baby items she took from me because I was saving them for my future children?,"I (22F) have been saving my baby items from when I was young. This ranges from clothing, blankets, bibs, bottles, decor, crib bedding, and other miscellaneous items. I had it all in boxes in my closet -- some decor I had displayed in my room. I have sentimental attachment to it and want to pass it down to my children in hopes of it being a family heirloom one day. 

My sister (26F) had her first child, my niece. I love my sister and her little family. I adore and love my niece and I've gotten a few baby items or toys for her as well. 

When I returned home from university, i noticed that the decor I had displayed was gone. I asked my mom about it and she said my sister saw the decor and she told her to take it. I told her that I was saving it for my future children and my mom just denyed that it was valuable to me. 

Regardless, I didn't want to argue with her about it. I went back to my room and saw that all of my boxes were gone as well. I call my sister to confirm and yes, she had taken everything. I tried to be reasonable and I told her, ""i'd like everything back once you're done with it."" My sister got very angry at me, saying that it was hers now and she plans to use it for her other children - and then pass it down. I told her that this was all MY baby stuff and if she wanted heirlooms, she should have saved her own baby items. Her argument was that she never planned on having children so she didn't save anything, mom gave her the stuff so now it's hers, and that I should just deal with it because ""if it was so important, why didn't you take it with you (to college)?""

At this point, i felt like i was arguing with a brick wall. I demanded my stuff back immediately and said I'd go over to her house and get it back myself. I tried to be nice and let her use it until my niece grew out of it but she just doesn't want to give it back at all. She told my mom and my mom yelled at me saying that technically, all of my baby items are my mom's possessions since she purchased them, thus my mom has every right to give to whoever she pleases. My mom and sister also claim that i'm lying about these items being valuable to me and im just saying that to be rude. 

Mom, sister, and BIL say I'm in the wrong, my dad isn't getting into it, my others siblings are minors (below 10 y/o) so i'm not taking their opinions seriously. Basically the entire family is against me and I don't know what to do. I do know that my sister isn't well off but I did offer her to keep the items for now but that wasn't enough for her. AITA? 

tl;dr: My mom gave my older sister (26F) all of my (22F) baby items that I was saving for my future children while I was at university. My sister refuses to ever give them back.

EDIT: i wanted to add some clarifications due to comments. my mom saved our things (as well as my younger siblings) and we all have them in our closets. those items were mainly clothing and bedding. when my sister moved out, she was sorting through things and decided she didn't need them. her reasoning (to my understanding) being she didn't plan on having children. ever since she was a teen she said she didn't want children. so she decided to donate them all, she was maybe 23 or 24 when she moved out so it wasn't that long ago and imo, she was grown enough to see the impact of that. we have a younger sister and she didn't take her things 1. bc my mom didn't let her and 2. bc my things are closer to the time my sister was born in and she wanted more older style items rather than modern.

however, a lot of the items - such as toys or decor - were used on my room until i did a remodel of my room in my teens. those items were my decision to save. also the bottles and bibs were in the back of the kitchen storage which i also decided to save once i was older. my mom does take the credit for saving clothing and bedding and some blankets, but some of it was my decision to save as well (other blankets, decor, bottles, toys, etc)

Also, i still live at home. i go to university out of state so i live on campus during the school year and come home during breaks. my room is still mine until i move out, which is hopefully soon once i graduate in december. 

EDIT 2: i am mexican so a lot of the items are culturally significant. my bibs were not regular bibs you can buy at walmart, they have cultural significance. the bottles are glass and the nipples have been removed. some of the blankets (and bibs) even have my name embroidered. i'm not sure what my sister is doing with those items - or if she will remove my name and put my nieces name over the top. i know it might seem silly to pass down these items to my kids but i have that sentiment and that was my plan for years now.

I then checked my phone and saw that Belt had texted me and asked to pick up her shift for Friday which was the following day; because, she had her grad party. Although when telling me why, she never mentioned a grad party and simply told me that she needed to sort out college stuff before 6pm. I decided to just leave it until the next day. So then the next day I told her I couldn’t pick up the shift and that I had a date which I had already had planned earlier that week and I assumed that would be it with no troubles. So I go along my day and as I’m texting one my friends who was on shift that night; he called me an asshole for not taking her shift and that was when I was told about the grad party. This was at 4pm and I was going to pick up my date at 6:30 and we both were already getting ready. Yes I did feel like an AH that she couldn’t go but I feel as it isn’t my fault and stand by that decision. I don’t exactly know if she only asked me or what, but I know there are multiple things she could’ve done to not be put on shift, such as: putting the day as unavailable bc of the grad party or even asking in the workplace group chat. The managers are super chill and definitely wouldn’t have  put her on if they knew before hand. Though I can see how I could be seen as the AH I don’t believe I should be to blame.

78,1d1un9v,AITA for not letting my mom stay at birthday party?,"I'm a 20 y/o student and live with my mom. We have a pretty good relationship and relatively open dialogue.

A month before my 20th birthday, I asked her if she could leave me the apartment so I could have a party. She said it was ok, no problem, she would stay at my uncle's house with her laptop for work.

A day before the party, though, she said she couldn't spend the night at my uncle's anymore because of an issue with her work, which would require her to use the home PC.

This upset me because ever since I started having friends she has a history of disrespecting my boundaries and privacy whenever I would bring them over. She wanted to get drunk and smoke weed with us, overshared details about her sex life, and her presence obviously prevented me from talking about anything I wouldn't want her to hear.

This also happened at my 18th birthday party and one time when one of my friends had his birthday party at our apartment.

I got mad at my mom and we fought. I said this was the only thing I'd asked her for the party and she couldn't even keep her promise. She couldn't seem to understand why her presence at my party with my friends would bother me.

I believe that having a month to prepare to spend one night away should've been enough to prevent any sudden problems that would've required her to stay at home.

I also believe that no one owes an eternal debt of gratitude towards their parents simply because they are parents. I felt disrespected by my mom expecting me to be okay with her breaking a deal made a month before.

She used money against me saying that she pays for my stuff (info: my mom owes me money since I started working as a child, so I don't think that's a valid argument) and said I mistreat her by leaving the house messy (she's messier than me, leaves dirty dishes everywhere and expired food in the fridge).

In the end she managed to pack her stuff and go to my uncle's, and the next day my dad sent me a voice text saying I needed to apologize to her and invite her to the party. I didn't.

I think I might be TA for making my mom upset and ignoring my dad's request to invite her.

80,1d1uev0,AITAH For Not Acting More Excited for My Mother’s 3rd Marriage?,"For some background: my mom (63F) divorced my dad back in early ‘00’s. They had been married about 20 something years. She met my stepdad during their divorce, lived together with my sister and I for years, and got married in 2008, I believe it was. In 2016, my mom’s job was outsourced and he was retired so they moved out west (where she had no other family except a brother), and after 2 months of living there my stepdad dropped dead of a massive heart attack. 

Flash forward through COVID, pandemics lockdown, getting Q radicalized, and almost dying from COVID herself, and we finally get her to move back home where all her family is. She’s very independent- goes to dance clubs every weekend, and since she’s been back she met a guy we will call “Joe” in the club last year. In October they apparently started dating, and she said both are widows so they “get it.” She said very quickly they knew they wanted to be together and by this past February they were already planning to move in to his house when her lease was up this August, so she promptly started having him upgrade his appliances, repaint his home, etc. I feel like she’s just barged into his life and started making changes, but she insists they’re things they’ve decided “together.” Then she says she’s told him if they’re gonna live together she’s told him they need to get married because she’s not just going to be someone’s love-in girlfriend. 

So about a week and a half ago, “Joe” proposes to her spur of the moment. Now she’s trying to get married ASAP. She’s changed her stance from getting married shortly after they move in to they absolutely must do it before they move in together because she “reads the scripture and doesn’t want to disappoint god.” I keep trying to tell her to make sure she’s making rational, wise decisions but she brushes me off and says “neither of us is getting any younger,” and insists he’s told her all his secrets. But to this I point out she said the same thing about my stepdad, until years into their relationship he had a health scare that prompted him to have to tell her he was actually 16 years older than he told her he was this entire time. Things she’s conveniently forgotten. She always talks down about people that meet their partners and then get married quickly, but that’s exactly what she’s doing. She also says it’s never a good idea to make big decisions when you’re in that “butterfly, starry-eyed” phase of a relationship but that’s exactly what she’s been doing. I am frustrated because she’s very gullible, and a hopeless romantic. I want her to be happy, but I also want her to make smart choices. Am I wrong here? ",No A-holes here,2024-05-27,"AITAH For Not Acting More Excited for My Mother’s 3rd Marriage? For some background: my mom (63F) divorced my dad back in early ‘00’s. They had been married about 20 something years. She met my stepdad during their divorce, lived together with my sister and I for years, and got married in 2008, I believe it was. In 2016, my mom’s job was outsourced and he was retired so they moved out west (where she had no other family except a brother), and after 2 months of living there my stepdad dropped dead of a massive heart attack. 

Flash forward through COVID, pandemics lockdown, getting Q radicalized, and almost dying from COVID herself, and we finally get her to move back home where all her family is. She’s very independent- goes to dance clubs every weekend, and since she’s been back she met a guy we will call “Joe” in the club last year. In October they apparently started dating, and she said both are widows so they “get it.” She said very quickly they knew they wanted to be together and by this past February they were already planning to move in to his house when her lease was up this August, so she promptly started having him upgrade his appliances, repaint his home, etc. I feel like she’s just barged into his life and started making changes, but she insists they’re things they’ve decided “together.” Then she says she’s told him if they’re gonna live together she’s told him they need to get married because she’s not just going to be someone’s love-in girlfriend. 

So about a week and a half ago, “Joe” proposes to her spur of the moment. Now she’s trying to get married ASAP. She’s changed her stance from getting married shortly after they move in to they absolutely must do it before they move in together because she “reads the scripture and doesn’t want to disappoint god.” I keep trying to tell her to make sure she’s making rational, wise decisions but she brushes me off and says “neither of us is getting any younger,” and insists he’s told her all his secrets. But to this I point out she said the same thing about my stepdad, until years into their relationship he had a health scare that prompted him to have to tell her he was actually 16 years older than he told her he was this entire time. Things she’s conveniently forgotten. She always talks down about people that meet their partners and then get married quickly, but that’s exactly what she’s doing. She also says it’s never a good idea to make big decisions when you’re in that “butterfly, starry-eyed” phase of a relationship but that’s exactly what she’s been doing.

81,1d1u9hl,AITA for not changing my travel plans?,"Me and my friends have been planning this trip for ages. Basically X has lived in the country we’re going to for a year and we (me and Y) were going to come see her before she moves back home.

I am broke so I originally said I couldn’t go, because it always gets really expensive when I travel with them but eventually they convinced me by saying that we would get to stay at X’s apartment for free.

The number one thing to do in the country is to hike… so I obviously wanted to do that, but they thought it would be too tight with our 8 days. So I said that’s fine and planned to do it before I met up with them instead.

Eventually they were intrigued though, and when it was time for Y to book her flights they had both decided they wanted to join me for the hike, making it a 14 day trip instead. Everyone’s happy, all good….

Then slowly the problems start to pile up. So first of all X decides to move and gets a contract that will end before our trip.  This meant that we would now have to book accommodation. (Yet I was not complaining)

But for whatever reason Y really wanted to book a place for the full 14 days and use that as a “base” to leave her bag, which to me made little sense as I travel light and since we wouldn’t be there for a large proportion of the time anyway.

This led to a fair bit of argument but after a while we came to the conclusion that she was gonna get it anyway and that she was fine with me just paying for the days we were there… me and Y were both okay with this agreement as money is not a problem for her and this way we both got what we wanted (the agreement also included that I would sleep on the sofa etc.). X was less happy about it, not because she was bothered about paying, but because she felt like it was selfish of me to not want to pay for the whole duration. I explained how it simply wasn’t gonna work out for me to pay for double accommodation but that if it bothered her that I could just stay at a hostel or whatever. Eventually she let it go but with some repressed anger.

Eventually it’s time to look into the hike and book stuff (it’s a very touristy hike so you have to book accom well in advance). I’m told to do it. So I spent hours figuring out the best route etc.

However… for whatever reason Y then decides she didn’t wanna do it anymore. Not because she didn’t like the program I had put together, she just simply didn’t feel like going on a hike anymore.

And this is where I might be the asshole, cause I then said I kinda still wanna do it.

X also still wanted to do it, but it obviously makes little sense to leave Y alone (and X lives there anyway and could do it whenever)… but for this reason she wants me to do it with her “before the trip” instead (which now apparently is the whole 14 day thing).

As much as I would want to do that, I’m not able to afford a 20 day trip and I’m not really willing to give up on the hike only to spend 14 days in the tiny capital (like 8 days would’ve been pushing it already).

When I expressed this they just said “u can always leave earlier if u so stressed”, but I have plans to meet up with another friend in the neighboring country afterwards and she has already booked her tickets too, so I would have to wait around for her anyway… 

And now they’re turning it into me being selfish and inflexible. X even brought up the accommodation thing again saying that I can’t cut the trip short/cancel on them now that the accommodation is booked? Even if the original plan was that I wouldn’t pay for it when we were on the hike anyway…

83,1d1sy3c,AITA (we) for not including our step sister in a gift for our mom-her stepmother?,"
Recently our mom celebrated a really big milestone birthday. Over a year before her big day she invited all of us on a cruise to celebrate. We are her four bio kids-47F, 45F, 42F and 33M -our half brother- and our partners and kiddos our step dad who essentially raised us and our step sister. Our mom and step dad have been married for 35 years- He has a daughter (51F) from his first marriage which ended 14 years before our mom married him. 
Our step sister was always really difficult-she was an only child and in our perception was spoiled and acted entitled. She rarely visited and when she did-maybe 3-4 time a year-she was demanding and petulant-she was in her 20s and we were middle school age and younger. 
There was a falling out for a few years in her late 20s between our step dad and his daughter-they didn't speak at all-The rest of us got on with our lives-college, marriage, etc.
 After a few years our mom tried to be ""the peace maker"" and bring them together -she arranged for them to visit her where she lived-3 hours away-made sure there were acknowledgments of birthdays and holidays, made arrangements for her to attend family milestones like weddings etc. 
Our step sister moved out of state (she lives with her mom and step dad.) Our mom arranged for mini trips to visit with her-she has a minor disability and doesn't work.
During this time our step sister never showed any gratitude or appreciation for what our mom was trying to do-she rarely wanted to be included in family gatherings (but would complain if she wasn’t 
invited) 
Fast forward to the family cruise (which my mom was paying for.) We-her bio kids-wanted to do something really special-we all chipped in for a very generous gift card to a spa/retreat. She has always been there for us and has been generous in helping when needed. She really deserved something special. 
The first night of the cruise we presented her with individual cards and our gift. Later that evening our stepsister railed on our brother-her half brother- for not including her. She ranted that she was so embarrassed and humiliated because she wasn't included (she didn't even bring a birthday card) In all honesty we hadn't even considered her because she rarely interested in participating in any of our ""family"" events and besides this was our Mom- So-AlTA -(we) because we didn't ask if she wanted to be included? (She showed up empty handed-not even a cheap birthday card) As a side note-she has never acknowledged any of us -ie-birthdays, etc. Once in a while she will ""like"" one of our posts on Social Media-but has never reached out otherwise. Essentially she really doesn't give a flying leap about any of us -not even her dad. We really believe she maintains the minimal amount of communication with him to stay in his will.

Despite me and my brother, 25M, telling her to not take the cats with her, she decided to anyway. She’s currently in [insert country she’s moving to], and all 4 cats are there too. She’s been there for a week and over the past few days they’ve been progressively getting more and more unwell, but she can’t afford getting them proper healthcare there (this was one of the main reasons my brother and I wanted the cats to stay with us - here, we’re eligible for free veterinary care).

My mum had another cat in [insert country] who literally died a few days ago from being severely ill, and now my baby (my fav cat) is starting to mimic that cat’s symptoms, so I yelled at my mum over the phone blaming her for all of the cats getting ill saying that my brother and I warned her this could happen and she chose to be selfish and take the cats with her instead. 

Naturally, she’s pretty pissed off at me now, but she went as far as to get her friends to message me berating me because “she’s your mother” but they don’t even know the full situation.

In the meantime, she’s been travelling back and forth between where we live now and where she’ll live to move all of her belongs bit by bit. 

Despite me and my brother, 25M, telling her to not take the cats with her, she decided to anyway. She’s currently in [insert country she’s moving to], and all 4 cats are there too. She’s been there for a week and over the past few days they’ve been progressively getting more and more unwell, but she can’t afford getting them proper healthcare there (this was one of the main reasons my brother and I wanted the cats to stay with us - here, we’re eligible for free veterinary care).

My mum had another cat in [insert country] who literally died a few days ago from being severely ill, and now my baby (my fav cat) is starting to mimic that cat’s symptoms, so I yelled at my mum over the phone blaming her for all of the cats getting ill saying that my brother and I warned her this could happen and she chose to be selfish and take the cats with her instead. 

Naturally, she’s pretty pissed off at me now, but she went as far as to get her friends to message me berating me because “she’s your mother” but they don’t even know the full situation.

87,1d1rxev,AITAH for being picky about cannoli? ,"My boyfriend and I are vacationing in Italy. Yesterday I bought an amazing cannoli (my first cannoli in Italy). My boyfriend discouraged me from buying another one to go (which is what I wanted to do) because he thought it would melt in the car.

Today we left the island we were on and are staying in Naples. I saw a cannoli in a dessert shop that looked identical to the one I had yesterday while we were pulling our luggage on the street on the way to our Airbnb which was very close. I pointed it out to him and said “yay! They have the cannoli I want, look it’s exactly like the one yesterday.”

After we were settled for a few minutes in the Airbnb, I said “I really want to go back for
that cannoli I saw and get a lemonade too.” My boyfriend then said “How about you take a shower and I will go get it for you?” I was thankful and said that would be awesome. When he came back he had lemonade for us both, a dessert for himself, and two cannoli that were nothing like the one I saw. He told me he couldn’t find the one we saw. After taking a bite (it was not very tasty in my opinion) I said, “thank you so much for getting this for me and at the same time I really wanted the cannoli I saw” 

He was livid and told me I was ungrateful and high maintenance. And turned it into an argument about how I am so hard to travel with.

88,1d1rq8m,AITA for telling my cousins to cut their dad some slack?,"So my(m35) uncle(m47) is currently going through a divorce with his wife.


And while I generally don’t enjoy getting into other people's business, this weekend, given memorial day, I spent quite some time with my cousins Kate(18f) and Mary(21f).


And frankly I couldn’t stand the way they talked about their dad. I didn’t want to say much, but at some point Kate said something like: “i guess it was inevitable since mom’s getting old for him to cheat on her”


Yeah, I couldn’t stand it. Sure my uncle did cheat, but not because their mom was getting old, rather because she’s been an ungrateful PoS who’s treated him like a slave and money printer, and has been a complete recluse for the past 4 years.


For context(I explained all of this to my cousins too, they’re old enough to know now):


13 Years ago my uncle left his corporate job to start a business with me. I had the idea and the money(grandad croaked and left me everything), he had the technical know how.


For the past 9 years this man not only worked his ass off to provide for his family and grow the business I’m talking 90 hours work weeks, but he was also, housekeeper, cook, driver for my cousins. He didn’t miss ONE soccer match, or school play etc.


Maybe this’ll give a better perspective. One time, about 5 years ago, the dude overworked himself so much I had to drag him to a doctor to force him to take a week off. 


And while he was literally bedridden, his wife wakes him and tells him there are no groceries in the fridge so he HAS to go buy some.


She was always either too sick, too tired or “too busy with her job”.


I don’t think she drove the girls to a soccer match even ONCE.


And after covid things got worse. Now that her job is remote she became a complete and total recluse/germophobe. If before the household chores were 70%/30% now it’s more like 90%/10%. And she refused him any sort of physical intimacy for the past 4 years. And when he asked her to go for marriage counseling she just refused.


Oh and let’s not even mention their lifestyle creep which she took full advantage of despite her job’s pay not increasing that much.


Honestly my uncle’s been in a miserable marriage for a loong fucking while and the only thing that kept him together was the fact that my cousin’s were in the middle. 


Now that Kate is going off to college, which btw my uncle is paying in full for, and bought her an apartment near campus (he did the same for Mary).


I guess he had no more of a reason to stay with her.


Mary, kind of just stood there frozen, then she started crying and calling her dad to apologize.


But Kate just got angry at me and called me an asshole.

89,1d1rlp3,AITA-I didn't consult my girlfriend on kids lower school graduation and party.,"My 11 yo daughter is ""graduating"" lower school tomorrow.  My ex wife texted me mid week last week and said she thinks we should do something for our daughter after graduation.  I said ""sure"" and on Friday, she offered to host a party at her place.  That was fine by me, and she asked if I could bring a cooler of ice with some beer and I agreed. I think the party is small maybe 3-5 other kids and some parents. 

I told my girlfriend(18months) about the graduation and the after-party on Sunday morning, two days after the plans were made. I made the mistake of saying ""My ex wife and I"" were hosting a party for the kids.  She got really upset with me that 

1. I didn't consult her and that by having the party at my ex's it somewhat excluded her due to the awkwardness of my ex wife around my gf.

2. She feels ignored and that I'm favoring the ex wife and her feelings. She thinks my ex is using her power to gain my attention. ( I have no feelings for my ex, fwiw)

&#x200B;

From my perspective, a lower school graduation is kind of a non event.  My girlfriend might want to go, maybe not.  She is very close with my kids but going to their ""events"" is a more recent thing.  I can see her side of it because I wasn't thinking of her when agreeing to the after party at my ex's.  However, it doesn't seem she see's my perspective on this and is making a very big deal of this and we are in a fight over it. AITH?

90,1d1rfv3,WIBTA for telling my friend to carry a handkerchief? ,"My best friend has horrible seasonal allergies. Her nose runs and runs to an astounding degree. Just 24/7 oozing. She takes OTC allergy medication, but it doesn't seem to do much for her. If she blows her nose ever, it must not be often enough for me to witness. Instead, she just sits there miserably sniffling the most disturbing sounding wet, oozy sniffs. No air can make it through her passageways. Sounds miserable.

Anyway, as you can imagine, it is not ideal to spend time with someone when they are in a constant state of running mucus.. but obviously it isn't her fault and I love her/want to spend time with her.

Where this really goes off the rails for me, though, is that she doesn't carry something to wipe with. She uses her fingers/hands and wipes her nose. Everyone does this from time to time (often to a dry nose with no mucus), but she's constantly wiping against her very wet-filled nose with her hands. I figure she \*has\* to be getting mucus on her hands, right?

Sometimes she will grab a few bar napkins and use them to ""plug"" her situation up, but then she will pull them out and rotate them/put new ones in. The whole thing makes me very queasy. I don't understand plugging being the move when blowing your nose seems like it would help more, but I don't have allergies so I may be missing something.

The worst part, and the reason I'm tempted to say something, is that we order nachos or cheese fries for the table, and she is the first person partaking in the shared appetizer. I love sharing food with friends, but the idea of sharing with someone who has been rubbing snot all day grosses me out.

Would it be rude to ask my friend to carry a handkerchief, or even to ask her to wash her hands?

91,1d1rdeh,WIBTA - For not letting my extended family know ahead of time my sister is skipping our Mother's death anniversary event,"

 My brother (28), sister (26), and I (30) lost our mother almost 20 years ago suddenly. It has deeply impacted our lives, unsurprisingly, but due to us being 5 to 10 years old we do not have very many personal memories of her. Our family,  including extended, don't really talk about their memories of her as well, as it is very painful and we are all the stoic type when it comes to grieving.

It is soon approaching the 20 year mark of her passing, so I contacted our surviving family and her best friend to gather, pay our respects, and have a late lunch / early dinner aftwards. This is the first time I think we have done something like this since her funeral, all opting to visit as individuals or just my immediate family from time to time over the years. Everyone is on board, except recently; my sister.

While she did agree to it in a group call a month or so ago, after I sent something to the family group chat recently she said she was only going to the lunch since she ""didn't grieve that way and would rather do it alone on her own time"". The reason this statement bothers me is that she has never expressed an aversion to going with us over the last 20 years, she didn't bring this up when I first spoke of the plan or when we all saw each other recently, and it overall broke my heart.

I completely understand having your own ways of expressing grief, but I think it is important to be with your family, relationship depending ( none of us are non or limited com with each other ), during events like this. This is about being there for our family and honoring our mother, so for one of her daughters to not be present with no history of doing so prior is selfish. I did ask her if there was another reason privately, but she said there wasn't and she just didn't want to go.

I've opted not to tell my extended family ahead of time and since there will be less then 10 people there, we have lost a lot of our family members especially over the last 5 years, her absence will be painfully felt. I'm not stopping her or the other members of my immediate family from telling them, but I'm not. I feel that if there is fallout for her behavior she will need to be the one to deal with it.
 
Also, I am not blind to the fact that I could be the one who cares too much and me trying to mitigate damage could make it worse. Seeing how much it effects me I also doubt I could keep my bitterness from showing and making it look like even more of a slight. Even if no one else shares the same reaction as me, I am fully aware that I am disappointed in her truly and I will go limited com after this. At the very least, to let my emotions simmer down. 

So with all that, WIBTA for not telling my Mother's remaining siblings, her best friend, and those coming with them in support that my sister will not come to the grave with us for the 20 year mark and possibly let her face thier judgement at the lunch directly afterwards?

Edit/update/reflection: 

I really do appreciate all the feedback and perspectives. Truly, I understand that IATA and WBTA in this situation. I'm happy I asked ahead of time, but obviously I have a lot of other work to do. Sometimes it's good to get your ass kicked on the internet.

While this post will never be able to convey the full spectrum of either side and my relationship with any living/deceased members of my family or what led up to this; it is good to hear from outside p I should compartmentalize situations better instead of using it as another straw on a strained camel's back. She is her own person and is not wrong for how she wants to express her grief no matter what else is going on outside of that.

As I said in some of my replies I forget that in trying to be selfless I am selfish because I become inflexible; in that I have created a bitter bed to lie in.

Hopefully, this all made makes sense.

TL;DR: IATA, thank you for telling me.

Per our tradition, couples usually tell each other's parents first that they wanna get married. Then they'll start planning for the proposal/engagement ceremony and the wedding.

Her fiance's dad wants a big wedding and agreed to pay for the wedding, from inviting 300 people, the decor, the dress, the Wedding Organizer, down to their customized wedding rings. They both started planning with their WO since January this year. Safe to say, my bestfriend's stress has been high. She's been complaining about how busy she is with the whole planning with the WO. I've offered to help with some, but she declined and said this is her event, she doesn't want to bother/burden us with anything. For weeks now I've been thinking where the hell is her fiance in all this planning?? She's the one who made appointments for suit and dress fitting for them, the one looking for decor/color theme, the venue, the food, making guest lists, looking for invitation vendors, guest souvenir vendors, and many others. Her fiance's SIL criticized a lot of her choices (calling her color is wrong for December wedding, to telling her what time is best for holy matrimony so SHE (the SIL) won't have to wake up early), and her fiance didn't defend my bestfriend at all.

Last week she mentioned that she had a fight with her fiance cause she'd been asking him to check out the venue for their engagement photoshoot together with her (which she also looked for herself), and he kept delaying it. They finally did, but she's still annoyed at how laxed her fiance has been in all this. The final kicker was when she said her fiance HASN'T even made any appointment with the jeweler for their customized wedding rings. The wedding is 6months away and it takes at least 4months to get a customized rings here, could take longer.

Now I know my words next was a little harsh, but I just couldn't keep quiet about it. I told her that her fiance has been a big AH. This is THEIR wedding, not just hers. I asked her if she's 100% sure she wants to marry this guy now. Their 5 years haven't been smooth sailing, but now, all the little things they fought over when they were dating have become glaring red flags. The one asking to have this big wedding is HIS dad.

She went silent, then told me that I shouldn't have called her fiance an AH and that he's just not good with planning stuff. She said I'm being very insensitive and mean about the whole thing, that I wouldn't understand since I don't even have a bf, and hung up on me.

93,1d1r18g,AITA for telling my boyfriend his family made a bad impression after he told me the same thing? ,"My boyfriend and I went to his sister’s wedding over the weekend. It was the first time I met his family. We left Thursday evening and came back yesterday. 

For context, my boyfriend James is British, while my family is not, so this might be a contributing factor as to why the weekend was pretty uncomfortable. Which it was.

On the way home yesterday, James was talking about meeting my family sometime soon, and I said maybe when my dad is next in town (he lives in Spain). James joked he hoped he’d pass the dad test and I said my dad isn’t that kind of parent. I made some joke about this weekend being a “Balmoral test” and if I passed. James got kind of squirmy and said it wasn’t a big deal, but I didn’t make the best impression on his family. I obviously asked what he meant. 

Things I apparently did that were faux pas:

- Woke up too early and dressed for breakfast
- Chose to go to pick up food with my boyfriend and his dad rather than staying with his mum and sisters
- Wasn’t friendly enough to the kids
- Didn’t eat enough 
- Said no to too many offers (snacks, tea, shower gel) 
- Bought wine I liked at a supermarket 

Now, I completely respect their right to feel how they feel about the things that I did. I may not agree, but between cultural and personality differences, if they just didn’t like me that is fair enough. However, I feel like it was a bit unnecessary of James to mention this to me. It seemed like he was fishing for some kind of apology from me. I said as much and James said he was just being honest. I said that in the interest of being honest his family made a bad impression on me too. 

Things I mentioned that made me uncomfortable:

- Badgering me about my eating habits
- Calling me “stunted” because I went to boarding school 
- His mother not allowing me to do anything for myself, such making my own tea
- Repeatedly trying to convince me to play with his sister’s kids and telling them to bother me when I said no 
- His teenage cousins making extremely inappropriate remarks to me at the wedding 
- The whole family getting absolutely paralytic at the wedding 

James said I was being cruel about his family and that I should have kept my comments to myself. He said he was just trying to make the point that I should loosen up when I next see his family, not saying there was something wrong with me, but I had basically called his family uncouth thugs.

95,1d1qldg,AITA for saying my sister ruins fun things for me and I won't let it keep happening?,"My sister Emily (15f) does not do good around people or places she's not familiar with. She hates being away from our parents and gets really homesick. She gets overwhelmed easily. Our parents will then make sure to take her out of the environment or cancel plans so she's comfortable again and they do this for all of us and not just for Emily and one parent so I (16f) could enjoy things still. It's all of us that leave. This includes our own birthday parties, sleepovers with family members, trips with and without our parents and plans with friends. This happens to me a lot. I don't think I ever got to fully enjoy one of my birthday parties, and I never get the option to have a party without Emily, even like a friend thing where we go see a movie. Emily will just text or call my parents and then they blow up my phone. One time I tried to ignore it and they stormed into the theatre after us and made me leave with her and berated me the whole way home about letting Emily be miserable for my sake.

We did a summer camp for the first time last year and Emily didn't even last the full day. The camp counselors were trying to talk Emily into waiting just a while but she called our parents and they took both of us home.

Another time we went on a multiclass fieldtrip and she hated it and wanted to leave after two hours and my parents demanded that I was going with them. My teacher was trying to tell my parents I could stay and go home like normal after the fieldtrip but they weren't having it.

I have tried everything to get through to my parents from heart to hearts, to acting out, to crying to them about it. None of it works. None of it will ever work. I gave up on them ever doing better. They told me I can't make Emily feel like a failure. Sometimes Emily will find out my plans and will tell me she's going to ask our parents to make me let her come. A few times I told her she fucking sucks and I hate her because she knows she won't stay but she doesn't care if she ruins my fun. Emily told me our parents told her that a good sibling won't resent their sibling for needing to leave early.

I'm so over it all. I was over it years ago but felt like I had no control. Now I'm just hiding plans I really want to keep and trying to make sure Emily can't join. Then my best friends parents kinda fucked me over without meaning to. They asked my parents if I could go on vacatio with them and my parents were trying to make the invite happen for me and Emily.

99,1d1pd2z,AITA for attending my son's game when his mother said I shouldn't?,"I (34M) have been divorced from my ex (31F) since December. We got divorced after I spent a summer trying to fix our marriage when I discovered her affair. After saying she'd never be faithful to me again, we separated and were finally over. We share our 4 year old son who is just my whole world. I only live in this town because we moved here for her to go to school, where she met AP and left me; so I'm really only here for my son. He is currently playing T-Ball and had his second game the other week, where the issue started.

I'll spare some of the other drama for another post if needed, but after that game, my ex and I got into a few verbal arguments about how I treated her AP and mother and that I was apparently 'rude' and 'unwelcoming' to them. I still don't know what I should have done in that situation....was I supposed to be jolly and act like their affair and lies didn't matter? Like I was supposed to treat them as family? No thanks. I don't plan to be rude, but I don't see any need to be friendly either, I'm just neutral as I'm tired of giving her or them any of my emotions. Now, to the issue:

My son and his team were invited to the local Triple-A ballclub for their season opener to meet the team and watch the game on a Wednesday. So I said I told my ex I would meet them there as this was a fun event that I wanted to be present for with my son. She said that I was not invited and should not go as it is her day to have my son and because I created an uneasy feeling for her being around my ex, I shouldn't go. I took this very personally as there was no way I was going to be denied time with my son for her issues. She said ""Well, if you're there, just know it's my right if we do not come at all"" to which I responded ""I will be fine and can handle being around you all, so if you don't come, that's on your conscience""

Well, I went to the game, and she did not. She did not bring our son, so there I was as the only parent without their kid present for the game. I still joined the team as I'm an honorary coach and wanted to support them all, but I left soon after as I just didn't know what to do. I feel as if she has chosen her 'comfort' over what was best for our son. I'm not even mad, just disappointed and realizing how selfish she is. But Reddit, AITA? I know I have every right to be at my son's events, and I'm not going to sacrifice that time with him, but this was just hard to bear so I'm seeking advice. I felt like my son was robbed of a wonderful moment and that this will be a theme for our post-divorce life and I don't want that for my kid. We have not spoken on the issue since it happened and I'll be seeing her for the first time today to get my son back. She says we need to 'respect' each other and act like stable parents, but then she goes and pulls this on me, which I feel is way more disrespectful, but could I be wrong?

I was happily telling by boyfriend (26M) about it, but he yelled at me and called me insensitive. 
In my defense, he didn't plan on losing any weight and I didn't judge him at all on that. I think he's beautiful and I've always told him that so I didn't think he had some insecurities regarding his weight. 
I didn't mean to offend him and I think he's still mad at me. But he won't listen when I try to apologise or explain myself. Am I really the asshole?

Edit:

This isn't the first time I talked about my weight but he's never yelled at me like this before. He used to just say ""That's great, baby"" and continue on with whatever he was doing.
I understand that it may be insulting to him if I were criticising myself and pointing out the negatives of not doing what I do, so I do not do that.

I will admit that I do stop him often from buying too much fast food, but it's not because of his weight, but rather, I don't want him to get cancer or have some vitamin deficiencies or whatever.
I don't care about his weight, I love him dearly. I absolutely don't want to break up.

Thanks for everyone's replies, though. It makes me feel a little better knowing I wasn't being awful even if it may have come across that way to him.

I won't be sharing my boyfriends weight, but I'm a 5'8 woman who's currently 134 lbs. I used to be 144 lbs., but I've never exceeded 150 lbs. I've never been under 115 either, if it's relevant. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-27,"AITA For Talking To My Chubby Boyfriend About My Weight?  I (23F) have been really strict when it comes to my weight. I am careful with my food and I go to the gym regularly. I've been wanting to lose weight and recently, I lost ten pounds.
I was happily telling by boyfriend (26M) about it, but he yelled at me and called me insensitive. 
In my defense, he didn't plan on losing any weight and I didn't judge him at all on that. I think he's beautiful and I've always told him that so I didn't think he had some insecurities regarding his weight. 
I didn't mean to offend him and I think he's still mad at me. But he won't listen when I try to apologise or explain myself. Am I really the asshole?

102,1d1p5zx,AITA for not letting someone switch seats mid-flight,"My wife (36f) and I (34m) were flying back from Dublin to Washington DC. We were assigned the middle and window seats in a row. The aisle passenger no-showed so we ended up having the entire row to ourselves (huge win). Before leaving the gate, I moved to the aisle seat and my wife stayed at the window.

Nothing eventful happened for the first 4.5 hours of the flight. FAs were amazing and even gave us extra drinks for the “guy in the middle”.  Randomly, the passenger from the aisle seat across from me comes over with her friend who was sitting a few rows back and ANNOUNCES that her friend would now be taking the middle seat to get away from an crying baby further back. She did not ask - she told us this was happening. There were about 3 hours of flight time remaining. 

I ask the woman whether the Flight Attendants are on board with this. She said yes, but since these deals are usually brokered by the FA, I called over a FA. The FA said the agreement was that they could take an available aisle seat but could not disrupt anyone’s seating arrangements. The woman then starts bitching about how I was assigned the middle but then moved to the aisle before takeoff, so I shouldn’t even have that aisle seat. I had been sitting there for almost 5 hours and we had already distributed our items all over the row. 

The woman and her friend disappear to talk to another FA for about 5 minutes. The woman across the aisle then comes back to her seat and proceeds to yell at me saying that “her friend would not be sitting there - not because she was not allowed to, but because I was so incredibly rude” and that I was a “fucking asshole”.  I kept my eyes on the show I was watching. 

The only thing I did this entire time was ask to talk to the flight attendant. I did not say anything else to this woman, though I would have liked to.

At first they ""were on a break"" while she spent some time living separately and enjoying the freedom of singlehood. She had some fun for a while, but after a couple months started having casual ""fun"" with another friend of mine, 38M, and they continued this situationship on and off to present day. They ended up developing feelings for each other and the whole thing was a bit of a mess.

HOWEVER, about a year ago was when the cheating started, as she had endeavored to stop living the free life and was committed to fixing her marriage. But as you already know, it wasn't long before she secretly went back to the casual fun situationship guy. Their secret played heavy on many people in our friend group, but she assured us time and time again that she owned her mistakes and wanted to be better at fixing her marriage. This didn't last long as she felt she could stay friends with situationship guy, which always led back to them becoming more than friends.

Flash forward to almost 3 months ago, we all took a trip away for a concert and went out drinking afterwards. After bearing the burden of their secret for so long, obviously ""drunk-me"" had had enough and decided to tell my bestie how much keeping their secret was affecting me while we were out in the clubs. I didn't remember this convo until a week later where she sent me a text that refreshed my memory explaining that I had threatened to tell her husband if she didn't. There was a lot in her message, but she explained that by saying that I crossed a boundary. She said she didn't want to fight, so I only said I was sorry and that although I couldn't remember much, I definitely used the wrong time and place to have that conversation. She then ended up telling her husband everything that week because of what I had allegedly said. (And for those nosy people wondering, I don't know what the status of their relationship is at present).

Since then, I remembered a bit of what happened and how much the situation was affecting me. I had said I felt it was getting to the point where I felt so guilty I may have to tell her husband. But, we have not had a chance to talk as I've given her space, with one message to check in and tell her I loved her a few weeks ago. 

I've talked with quite a few friends because I didn't know if I was the a-hole because she was so upset and so distant, but so far all of them said NTA.

104,1d1orcz,AITA for p*king on grass?,"Warning for people who have emetephobia this will have mentions of p*king. 

For context I am 8 weeks pregnant, and I have emetephobia (phobia of p*king) .

I do not puke often for obvious reasons but I suspected that it would most likely happen since I am pregnant. 

This morning I was at my friends house. I was alone in the loungeroom and felt a sudden wave of nausea come. This really scared me so usually when I feel nauseous I go outside. Going into a bathroom when I feel nauseous causes me to panic more. Anyways unfortunately I did end up puking outside on the grass. 

Anyways my friend is still asleep so I let his housemate, let’s call him Barry, know what just happened and I was going to ask if he wanted me to hose it into the grass. Barry then says “did you actually?” Which I confirmed. He then said “Just try to aim for the toilet next time” in a very obviously annoyed voice. He then says he’s going to go hose his lawn which at this point I was to flabbergasted to ask if he wanted me to do it. 


Barry came back after finishing and repeated the same thing of “just try to aim for the toilet”. For context as well I have told Barry several times that I have emetephobia. After he said that to me again I said “well I can’t guarantee that for the future and if I puke again on the grass I can just wash it off”. He once again emphasised he wanted me to use the toilet instead so I told him he was being a bit insensitive because of my emetephobia and he said “oh you have emetephobia “. I mean it when I say I have told this man at least 20 times because him and his mates get drunk a lot. The conversation just stopped after that but he still seemed annoyed. Even though my friend was still asleep I decided to leave because I felt uncomfortable. 

So am I the asshole? 

Edit: this is the first time I have gotten sick from being pregnant so I was completely caught off guard. The house is 2 storeys and the bathroom is upstairs so even if I wanted to I wouldn’t have made it. In saying this though I will admit I didn’t want to use the bathroom. The reason is explained above. He knows I’m pregnant and he knows what emetephobia is. 

A few people pointed out Barry might have assumed I wanted him to clean it up since I didn’t immediately say I would do it. I feel bad for him because that was totally not my intention to make him think I wanted him to do it as it would have been really easy for me to do it and I had only had vegetables to eat so far and water to drink. Even if it wasn’t easy for me would have done it and will do it in the future if it happens again. I would never want to impose that kind of thing on another person.

I had purchased Greyhound bus ticket, checked in as per instructions and boarded the bus when it arrived (its two tickets, one to border and one from border)

  
As I was inside guy came to me and said that I have to exit the bus because I didn't register my details at the desk (nowhere on ticket did it say that and I was even asking employee about the bus and he never mentioned it) and driver needs those details for TSA, but also that its fine and that next bus leaves in 30-40 minutes and I'll just board that one and will have enough time to catch the bus from border. But after I left the bus and it departed they just told me at desk that they made mistake and next bus actually goes to Mexicali and crosses border to Calexico (I had documents filled only for San Diego crossing) and I should take taxi to border instead. I did that, because no other options, and when I arrived cabbie told me to buy ticket for minibus which will take me to border which I thought its scam so I declined and said I'll just wait in line. Little I knew that waiting time in line is up to 4 hours. When I found out I started walking back to minibus kiosk, but got stopped by some local who told me he is selling 'tickets' for border (way he explained it they have people waiting in line and you'll just swap with them) for 30 USD. Figured its a victimless crime and took the deal, sat down at their office for a bit and eventually guy came to take me and older Mexican couple for 'swap'.

We arrived at nearly end of line and guy just parked with us next to the line and was texting someone, when I asked him if he's looking for guy who we are supposed to swap with he said yes and just kept moving with us slowly and before I knew it he bolted and was away. Yeah, turns out there was never any guy waiting in line and those guys are just professional line cutters, the Mexican couple looked just as confused as I was and straight away some guy started arguing with them that they cut the line and need to go back to the start of it and threatening to call guards if they don't. For life of me I'll never know how they didn't notice me (I'm fairly tall and hardly small guy, maybe those two were just easier target, IDK), but they didn't and they got all shit while I got away scot free and crossed the border soon afterwards and just barely managed to catch my bus. Don't know what happened to them as I tried not to attract attention.

As I was inside guy came to me and said that I have to exit the bus because I didn't register my details at the desk (nowhere on ticket did it say that and I was even asking employee about the bus and he never mentioned it) and driver needs those details for TSA, but also that its fine and that next bus leaves in 30-40 minutes and I'll just board that one and will have enough time to catch the bus from border. But after I left the bus and it departed they just told me at desk that they made mistake and next bus actually goes to Mexicali and crosses border to Calexico (I had documents filled only for San Diego crossing) and I should take taxi to border instead. I did that, because no other options, and when I arrived cabbie told me to buy ticket for minibus which will take me to border which I thought its scam so I declined and said I'll just wait in line. Little I knew that waiting time in line is up to 4 hours. When I found out I started walking back to minibus kiosk, but got stopped by some local who told me he is selling 'tickets' for border (way he explained it they have people waiting in line and you'll just swap with them) for 30 USD. Figured its a victimless crime and took the deal, sat down at their office for a bit and eventually guy came to take me and older Mexican couple for 'swap'.

We arrived at nearly end of line and guy just parked with us next to the line and was texting someone, when I asked him if he's looking for guy who we are supposed to swap with he said yes and just kept moving with us slowly and before I knew it he bolted and was away. Yeah, turns out there was never any guy waiting in line and those guys are just professional line cutters, the Mexican couple looked just as confused as I was and straight away some guy started arguing with them that they cut the line and need to go back to the start of it and threatening to call guards if they don't. For life of me I'll never know how they didn't notice me (I'm fairly tall and hardly small guy, maybe those two were just easier target, IDK), but they didn't and they got all shit while I got away scot free and crossed the border soon afterwards and just barely managed to catch my bus. Don't know what happened to them as I tried not to attract attention.

  
So that is my perspective, from perspective of someone who been standing in that line for 4 hours in direct heat I'm just a guy who cut line. So IAtA?",2.0,1.020959496498108,1,0

109,1d1nm9n,AITA for not waiting my friend because he was late?,"First of all, all the involved are latinos, and latinos has this ""latino hour"" thing where you say to someone ""meet me at 4pm"" and both of you show up 2 hours later. I am latino, but I found that very annoying and everybody knows that.

I (32M) was visiting a city where I lived before and I had a tight plan so I could do everything I want. My friend (32M) invited me to a restaurant, it was for us to catch up and for me to meet his new girlfriend, and we agreed on 7pm. He didn't want to make a reservation, but I did anyway because I hate waiting in lines.

Timeline:  
7pm - I am in front of the restaurant and he's not there.  
7:20 - I texted him telling him that I'll wait inside because they hold reservations for only 20 minutes.  
I enter to the restaurant. I order a drink.  
7:40 - He answers saying that he's on the way.  
7:44 - I call him asking where he's and he says that he's on the way and should arrive in 20 minutes.  
I am already really annoyed and I tell him that. I order another drink.  
At this point there aren't tables and I can notice the waiter looking at me because I was alone using a table for 4.  
8:10 - He's not there yet, I am very frustrated and I decided to order a snack, something small, while waiting. The waiter asks me if I want to change to a smaller table and explain that I am waiting for friends.  
8:20 - I call him again and he doesn't answer. I order another drink.  
8:45 - He texts me saying ""10 minutes"". I pay the bill and I leave.  
9:01 - He calls me, I don't pick up and I text him saying that I left.

He doesn't say anything at the moment, and then one hour later calls me angry saying that I embarrassed him, that his girlfriend felt bad thinking I didn't wait because I didn't want to meet her, which is a total stretch to me, and we had a little bit of an argument.

I asked the opinion of a common friend and he said ""he should be on time because we know how you are with time"", which makes me feel like I am right, but at the same time makes me feel like I am the problem here.

110,1d1nl65,WIBTA for trying to stop my brothers wedding?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

My brother is getting married to his childhood sweetheart soon. I didn't like the whole idea of the wedding because they're practically still kids and it would be dumb for them to get married so young. Our parents (ours and hers) are pretty pissed about it too but going along with it anyway because they were worried they might just elope and go NC otherwise.

Also, I'm in love with his fiancee. We all sort of grew up together (neighbours for 5 years when we were teens, parents close friends now etc) and she always had a big crush on me, but I ignored it because she was a kid, and really annoying, but her and my brother were always best friends because they were the same age. We had a bit of a thing when we were like 18/16, but again, I thought she was too young and also I was dealing with a lot of personal shit  at the time so I ended up pushing her away and making her think I didn't want her because I didn't want to hurt her worse in the long run, even though I kind of did start to really like her. I guess I thought she'd just be there when I was ready or something because she'd always been so obsessed with me.

Cue my freaking brother riding in on his white horse when I broke things off with her and them getting together, which was always his gameplan I think. FF four years, and apparently they're getting married. She's more religious than us and they've always done the purity ring bullshit so obviously my brother just got bored of waiting and wants to get married now so he can get laid. I don't think he's good enough for her and I never did, especially in the light of what I know now.

Anyway, my brother got really drunk the other night and told me that when they broke up for a while (I don't know why they broke up but I remember he was really cut up about it) last year he fucked someone else just before they ended up getting back together and he was going on to me about how bad he felt about it and how he didn't know she was going to take him back when he did it and he wished he hadn't (whatever, dick). I don't think she knows what he did, and I don't think she would marry him if she knew he'd  gone and cheated on her when they were broken up, especially if they are doing the whole no sex before marriage. 

WIBTA if I told her what he did, and told her how I really feel about her and maybe stopped the wedding? I really think she's my soulmate and that deep down she probably wants to be with me too she just doesn't know I'm in love her/still an option or that he's just a cheat?

At first he was super nice and kind. Very “accepting” of all her friends.  A few months in he wasn’t comfortable if she went out with our friend group if I wasn’t there, “ as I’m the only other girl in a committed relationship and he trusts me”.

As the months went on she was always making plans with me and then cancelling at the last minute with a lame excuse. It is at the point where she is lying to me and saying that she has to work. 

3 weeks ago we finally went for a coffee before work. She told me that he guilts he into staying home.  He tells he that she should do what makes her happy, but just know that he is not comfortable even if it is just the two of us going out. Apparently he is afraid of others guys approaching us.
He downloaded a location app on her phone and messages her if her location stopped at a place for too long even when he knows precisely where she is. 

Recently, it was one of our friend’s birthdays and she organised a girls trip. GIRLS TRIP!!!
She told me that when he saw the group chat on her phone he started crying and didn’t speak to her for 6 hours. 
Everytime she doesn’t go out with me(us) he brings her flowers and gifts as if he is rewarding her for not doing what she wants.


She hasn’t visited her parents alone in over a year. He wants her to quit her job( that she LOVES) so she can move to his town. She is actually really outgoing and free spirited.

 A week ago she asked me if me and my boyfriend of a year “allow “ each other to go out alone. I simply told he we don’t “ allow “ each other anything. We have an adult relationship and discuss these things. Most of the time if I need a girls night of he needs a guys night we just tell the other one and send a live location.

A few days ago I told her that she is losing herself and that I’m scared that I’m going to lose her. I also told he that she should stand up for herself because a 22 year old is controlling her from a town 3 hours away. 
She said that she understands where I’m coming from, but that she loves him and he treats her right. She wants all of us to go for coffee and to talk through this, so that HE can hear MY concerns. Am I the AH?

I (21F) am a college student. I originally started college about fall of ‘22, but due to a decline in my mental health I decided to go on medical leave. With that being said, I decided that I should take another shot at college starting this past fall. 

I also set a goal for myself to graduate in ‘26 instead of being in school another year. Unfortunately, the college I go to now is shutting down next month due to… a lot of reasons. With that, I decided to take advantage as much as possible and take some summer classes.

 Seeing that i recently changed my major, I thought it be a good idea take an online summer class for it. That’s where the story starts. My professor asked me to talk via zoom and I put it off thinking it was a general meeting, especially since it’s an asynchronous class. I did my best to get the owed work done since I joined late, which took me a couple hours minimum.

Less than a week later I get an email for an Academic Integrity referral. Dumbfounded is an understatement for what I was feeling. Seeing that it would be a meeting through zoom, I asked for a detailed written outline before the meeting so I could gather my thoughts. 

Both the professor and the Dean have so far been trying to twist my words around and not answer the question. For example, after the 5th out 11 times that I asked, I said the outline wasn’t negotiable and I wouldn’t attend the meeting without it. The dean tried to tell me I’m not allowed to negotiate the meeting. 

They keep ignoring the question and continue to refer to the policy they have, as if there is no proof. I sent an email stating that, in short, if there is proof I need that documented outline. I also said that I shouldn’t have to of asked 11 TIMES, if there is proof it shouldn’t be such an issue to get a document and I refuse to just take the professor’s word for it.


 Seeing that the college closes June 21 (less than a month now) this whole thing is ridiculous. I also sent the email to the dean quoting the professor word for word so they can read it. I don't know what type of plagiarism it is, just that it's apparently plagiarism?? So far that’s it.

114,1d1msid,AITA For not driving back for party?,"AITA For not wanting to come back to the place where I work for a party?

I want to start with the fact that this is my first time on reddit, so I apologize if it's a bit messy.

So let's start! The last few months have been absolutely crazy! Me and my fiance have been wedding planning and trying to keep ourselves calm and collected (our wedding is in 2 weeks). Recently, I got my sister in law's boyfriend (I'll call Damian (40 M)) a job where I work. Lately, it's been hell week!! We've been deep cleaning as much as we can because the owner came in and was not happy with the state of our kitchen. Normally, I work 4pm-10pm but in the last handful of days, I've been working 3:30pm-2am. Today was the worst of it all. I got absolutely ambushed by 4 walk-in parties (not scheduled) at the same time. Due to the intensity and stress, I called my manager to come back into work, to help me. I threw up 3 times in less than an hour, rushing around the kitchen cooking. Well, here's where things start to go wrong. Damian booked his party where we work because we get a 50% discount on everything. I told my sister in law that I would most likely be working during his party but that I wouldn't be able to participate. However, my manager wrote up the schedule for the week me and my fiance leave to go back to our home state for the wedding. I'm now working morning shift (10am-5pm) and this week will only be focused on cleaning. I come home everyday, soaked in sweat and smelling like bleach. I texted my sister in law, that I will most likely not be staying for the party that starts at 6pm-10pm. I even called Damian and told him, I'd stay the extra hour to say happy Birthday when he showed up but I would probably go home and not return for the rest of the party. We live 30 minutes away and after work I'm just too exhausted to keep driving. When I got home tonight at 2:30am, my fiance told me her sister was upset that I didn't want to drive back for the party and also told me her sister said ""If he doesn't come back for the party, that's it. Me and Damian are cutting ties with him"". Damian had no issue with me not wanting to drive back but now I feel pressured into going because I don't want to cause family drama with my fiance and her sister. My fiance and surprisingly my mother in law, sided with me. I haven't been able to talk to my sister in law as I just got home and showered while everyone was asleep. (besides fiance, who told me what sister in law said)

AITA For not wanting to come back to the place where I work for a party?

I want to start with the fact that this is my first time on reddit, so I apologize if it's a bit messy.

So let's start! The last few months have been absolutely crazy! Me and my fiance have been wedding planning and trying to keep ourselves calm and collected (our wedding is in 2 weeks). Recently, I got my sister in law's boyfriend (I'll call Damian (40 M)) a job where I work. Lately, it's been hell week!! We've been deep cleaning as much as we can because the owner came in and was not happy with the state of our kitchen. Normally, I work 4pm-10pm but in the last handful of days, I've been working 3:30pm-2am. Today was the worst of it all. I got absolutely ambushed by 4 walk-in parties (not scheduled) at the same time. Due to the intensity and stress, I called my manager to come back into work, to help me. I threw up 3 times in less than an hour, rushing around the kitchen cooking. Well, here's where things start to go wrong. Damian booked his party where we work because we get a 50% discount on everything. I told my sister in law that I would most likely be working during his party but that I wouldn't be able to participate. However, my manager wrote up the schedule for the week me and my fiance leave to go back to our home state for the wedding. I'm now working morning shift (10am-5pm) and this week will only be focused on cleaning. I come home everyday, soaked in sweat and smelling like bleach. I texted my sister in law, that I will most likely not be staying for the party that starts at 6pm-10pm. I even called Damian and told him, I'd stay the extra hour to say happy Birthday when he showed up but I would probably go home and not return for the rest of the party. We live 30 minutes away and after work I'm just too exhausted to keep driving. When I got home tonight at 2:30am, my fiance told me her sister was upset that I didn't want to drive back for the party and also told me her sister said ""If he doesn't come back for the party, that's it. Me and Damian are cutting ties with him"". Damian had no issue with me not wanting to drive back but now I feel pressured into going because I don't want to cause family drama with my fiance and her sister. My fiance and surprisingly my mother in law, sided with me. I haven't been able to talk to my sister in law as I just got home and showered while everyone was asleep. (besides fiance, who told me what sister in law said)

(Side note: this situation is even more tense because future sister in law, is a bridesmaid for the wedding.)

115,1d1mkzq,AITA For declaring visiting family is not a birthday present?,"DH and I have been married for nearly 20 years. We met while at university, maintained a long distance relationship for several years, and when we decided to get married I immigrated to his country.

(I do get homesick occasionally).

DH has been back to my country more in the last twenty years than I have, probably twice as many times.  Some of his work trips have brought him near my family so he'll schedule a few extra days to visit. A few times, in lieu of a big birthday present, he'll visit his good friends who live near my country.  This is how he chooses to spend his ""fun money"" and that's fine.

It'll have been six years since I've been home and I'm starting to worry about elderly family members.  Also, my 25th high school reunion and my niece's 18th birthday will be next year and it would be nice to coordinate with those.

116,1d1mawy,AITA for using the toilet while clean laundry was nearby?,"Hello all,

My fiancé and I recently moved into a 1.5-bathroom townhome where the washer and dryer are in the full bathroom. This has become an unexpected source of conflict. When we first moved in, she insisted that I never poop in the full bathroom, as she thinks it is very unsanitary to have a toilet in the place where we wash our clothes. I disagreed, but only used the half bathroom anyway to avoid conflict. After a week or so she relented and said it was ok to use the full bathroom toilet as long as the washer and dryer are not running. I still felt that this was unnecessary, but I considered it to be tolerable.

An hour or so ago, I pooped in the full bathroom while both machines were not running. Apparently, the dryer was full of freshy cleaned clothes though, and now she's furious with me. She said the clothes were brand new clothes she was very excited about, and now she has to wash them again, which she claims is a big deal because ""every time you wash clothes you ruin them a little"". She also claims that the dryer should still be considered ""running"" if the clothes haven't been taken out yet.

I feel that I am not TA because

1. No one else would reasonably interpret ""running"" to include a full dryer that has completed its cycle and turned off
2. It's ridiculous in the first place that we can't use an entire bathroom just because it's also the laundry room
3. She was the one who picked out the house in the first place and didn't tell me about this rule until it was too late to back out

Now she wants to ban the use of the full bathroom toilet entirely. I feel that I'm solidly in the right, but I've come to ask reddit anyway just in case there's something I haven't considered.

118,1d1m07m,WIBTA for spying on my sister to prove she’s lying,"I (18m) and my sister (20f) have been homeschooled all our lives. And for all our lives as well, my sister has been using her temper as a ""get-out-of-jail-free"" as she knows our parents are afraid of her due to her past actions almost destroying the family.

Ever since she was about 15, my sister has been throwing out all kinds of self-diagnoses about having ADHD, anxiety disorders, and depression, despite refusing to go to a medical professional. (we live in the UK, it's free here, not even like she's saving money).

She at one point had a job, but then had to quit because her mental health was spiralling. She doesn't take care of herself in any way, barely showers, and she doesn't brush her teeth. All in all, she seems in a bad way mentally, regardless of the authenticity of her disorder claims.

Recently though, she's been using Discord all the time, hanging out with internet friends. This is a good thing, as it seems to be helping her through her rough time and giving her something to be genuinely happy about.

However, one of the main sources of her issues is that she's not sleeping. She sleeps in  
super late, screwing over everyone else's mornings unapologetically. Wouldn't be a big deal, if it weren't for the fact that I know what she's doing: staying up all night on her phone, on Discord, then lying to us about it.

Since I'm neither her parent, landlord, nor legal guardian, I didn't really care. If she wanted to screw up her own life, it's her life right? But then, when I was in the process of getting set up for my first job (something I think is universally stressful) she came out with this spiel about how *me* getting a job was stressing *her* out so much that it was pretty much ruining her life, as it was the main reason she couldn’t sleep. Despite the fact that I  
know that’s a lie.

My parents partly believe me but are too afraid of her to confront her, but I hoped that with definitive proof maybe I could convince them, or even confront her myself to get her to stop making others feel guilty for her actions. 

So I stole my sister's phone and found out what server she's on. I didn't have time to look at her messages, but I could easily make a burner and go on the server myself to look if she's sending messages late at night.

Then, I started thinking that I was going too far. That even despite her knowingly ruining her own life and then (kind of) blaming it on me, it wasn't an excuse to violate her privacy like that, and that I was just becoming an asshole that's just as bad as her, if not worse. She values her privacy a lot, and I think that's partly the reason she's lying about the Discord thing at all: to make it so no-one snoops on her.

So WIBTA to follow through with my original plan and find out definitively if she's lying, or would that be a gross invasion of her privacy that I have no real excuse for?

P.S. this is my first reddit post ever, sorry if it's clumsily written.

Btw… He was the very first guy I ever liked and it really hit different because as a teenager boy that is bi, it’s hard to find that you really want in a relationship. One day is a boy and the next it’s a girl. But you never know what you will find in a relationship one you find that right one for you. 

Getting back to the story, At the beginning of junior year, my friend has been talking about on how cute this guy is and I would totally agree because I had a huge crush on him.  my friend and I would always talk about how he is as a person and how sweet he is etc. this has been going on for too long so I just decided to get them together so I can fantasize on what it’s like to have him in a relationship. This would also feed into my delusions about him being with me instead of my friend.

Fast forward to January of 2024. It was a new year and I was ready for what the word has got to test me with, and the first thing the world get to get a good clean shot of me is that my best friend that I shared my deepest confession of this man has got together.

I was mad at the fact she is really dating the guys I have been head over heels with ever since freshman year.

121,1d1kzis,AITA with not wanting my wife to call the non-emergency police line for a noise complaints on a business complex with loud music blasting to where it’s still loud in neighborhoods a few miles over?,"Context: 
Over the last month we have heard music starting around the hours of 10:00pm and ending anywhere from 1:00am to 3:00am every Saturday and/or Sunday.

It was so loud, we thought it was coming from a neighbors 8 houses down at the bottom of our culdesac but it actually got quieter when going down the hill.

Today my wife and I drove around and found the source of the music, about 3 miles away behind a business complex, where the sound bounces off the highway and surrounding structures enough to get to us and still be loud (can feel the bass vibrations in the walls). When we pulled in, there were several people dancing to Spanish music, portable stadium lights, lifted trucks, and more. We have no idea if the business complex knows this is happening. 

Obviously they were having a good time; however, it was too intimidating to get out to try and ask kindly for them to turn the music down with how many people were present, the one way entrance to the back of this business complex, and the fact that this specific day is a holiday weekend. 

My wife is a rules following on some things, plus is a teacher with early mornings and can’t sleep well with the bass reverberating through the walls. I personally don’t feel it is as bad as she makes it out to be, but acknowledge she is more sensitive to the noise.

Being that the people present at this party are assumed to be Spanish/hispanic, I did not want to call the non-emergency police line as I am very concerned about the people that may be harmed if a bad/racist cop ends up responding.

My wife believes that being inconsiderate towards others in the regard to blast loud music at all hours of the night, warrants calling the non emergency police line, even at the risk a bad cop being the one to respond, and is a risk anyone takes on when they choose to break the law (noise ordinance for our county is between 11:00pm-7:00am)

Further context: we are both white between 25 and 35 years old and own our house together. 

Also, any recommendations on what to do in this scenario (preferably without police involvement) would be appreciated.

122,1d1kv99,AITA for continuing stupid arguments with my friend?,"
I've had a couple best friends for over 10 years and we've always gotten along well. One of these friends though I constantly get into stupid arguments with. We are infamouse in our friend group for stupid arguments that can last multiple days and even lead to anger on both sides. These stupid arguments can disrupt our friend group for a day or so.

Things we have actually argued about:

Whether crocs are shoes or sandals?

I took the position that Crocs were shoes, and therefore sandals because sandals are shoes. He took the position that Crocs were sandles and that sandals were not shoes. No number of dictionary entries could convince him. This one was at a restaurant and got so heated that he shoved the table into my stomach (we were sitting across from each other) and stormed out dramatically stating he was walking home. This one didn't last more than that night and did involve alcohol, but only a drink each. We then followed him in a car until we could convince him to get back in the car and get dropped off.

Whether or not a smartphone is an audio video recording device?

We were going somewhere that didn't allow video audio recording devices. I wondered if this would include phones. He said he wasn't worried about it. Then I ask him if he considers a smartphone a audio video recording device. He said it depends on what you are currently doing with it at that second. I argued that a microphone and camera probably would not be allowed in even if they were not recording at the moment. This one got pretty heated and my dad even joined, but on his side. My dad didn't seem to have a good grasp on that argument though.

I have WAY MORE like that. Most of these would get heated enough to involve some mild yelling. I always kinda just wrote it off as my friend being difficult and stubborn, but I recently had a similar fight with my dad and now I'm worried I'm the problem.

My difficult friend is looking to get a bike and I'm helping him shop.  I started riding motorcycles on a 2014 yamaha bolt 950 which makes a maximum of 60 horsepower. My friend sent my dad and I link to a 2014 gsxr 1000cc bike that makes about 180hp. I told him this was a lot of bike to start on and he should shop for a 650 sport bike at most. My dad doesn't like that I told him to go smaller because I started on a 950 and we had a long argument about how different the power of the bikes would be. Top speed, speed in each gear, 0-60 time, and hp evidence on Google all failed to convince him of the difference between the bikes. 

I can't stress enough how much I love these people and how important they are to me. We also get along really well most of the time and I don't know why we clash so hard. From my perspective they are just unbelievable stubborn and maybe I need to stop arguments if they are pointless. But it's really hard for me to stop when I think the person I'm arguing is so blatantly wrong.


",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-27,"AITA for continuing stupid arguments with my friend? 
I've had a couple best friends for over 10 years and we've always gotten along well. One of these friends though I constantly get into stupid arguments with. We are infamouse in our friend group for stupid arguments that can last multiple days and even lead to anger on both sides. These stupid arguments can disrupt our friend group for a day or so.

Things we have actually argued about:

Whether crocs are shoes or sandals?

I took the position that Crocs were shoes, and therefore sandals because sandals are shoes. He took the position that Crocs were sandles and that sandals were not shoes. No number of dictionary entries could convince him. This one was at a restaurant and got so heated that he shoved the table into my stomach (we were sitting across from each other) and stormed out dramatically stating he was walking home. This one didn't last more than that night and did involve alcohol, but only a drink each. We then followed him in a car until we could convince him to get back in the car and get dropped off.

124,1d1km6q,AITA for indirectly breaking up a family?,"My apologies. This might be a long read.

27M. For context, I met a lady (38F) on Tinder. We didn't align relationship-wise, nor were there any casual intentions, but we did get along talking to each other, albeit infrequently at times

Fast forward months later, she calls me at 3 in the morning. She'd met a guy on Bumble. They hit it off well, she meets up with him and she brings him to meet her father who's hospitalised due to a lung infection. They got close enough in a few months that she knew of his work, his friends/contacts, and eventually, his relationship status.

He was married from the start despite claiming otherwise in the beginning. His Facebook had a photo of him and his family of 4. Despite him claiming he was unmarried. Needless to say, she was a mess of anger sadness at that point and only wanted to expose him to his contacts and family, whom she had contact access to.

I advised her not to. It wasn't worth the risk of getting herself into more emotional disarray when what was done was done, but I eventually relented. I didn't advise her on how, I just told her to be careful. To think about whether it was worth it to chase after a relationship that lasted months, even if she was heartbroken.

A few days later she messages me and tells me that she successfully made a police report, while she had also spread their chat to all of his friends and relatives. Although it seemed redundant, she reported him because he worked as a pastor for a church, and her intent was to throw shade on his name. Last I heard, he and his family fell apart. I don't know about his work. There never was word from her, nor anything on the news.

Growing up, she'd always be trusting of people and their ""intentions"", which led to her getting taken advantage of and wanting to be constantly protected by someone physically/emotionally, needing someone she could ""merge"" with and feel secure in. At least, that's what I understood from her.

I (tried to) put myself in the pastor's shoes before all this and no. I don't feel bad. If you throw something, it comes back to you doesn't it? And leaving your personal details online for people to see, then screwing around seems like a dull move. Knowing that, a large part of this event was me saying ""Okay. He lied to you.

I have two kids. My girl is 18 and in college, and my son is 16 in high school.

When I realized I was having a son, I was disappointed. I wanted another girl really bad, and felt like I wouldn’t connect with a son as much as I would a daughter.

I tried to get myself more excited about having a son, but I kinda wasn’t? It freaked me out, too, and I was really stressed about it for a while.

I wish I could go back and tell myself it would be fine because it’s absolutely fine. My son (like my daughter) is the best thing to happen to me and I love the two of them so much.

I genuinely sometimes look at him and have to hold back tears because he’s so precious to me.

He does good in school and has his friends he’s do anything for and is empathetic and caring and loves reading and animals.

I was in the car with my daughter and son and I was talking about it.

I mentioned that I was depressed when I found out I was having a son and freaked out and not sure if we’d be able to connect. I said thank god, that didn’t happen, and I have a great kid.

My son said, “Oh, I didn’t know you didn’t want a boy.” I said, “Well, I guess I never said it, but yeah.”

My daughter for some reason got so offended at my son’s behalf. She said, “If you weren’t sure you could connect with a son, why would you have kids in the first place? Of course there was a chance you’d have a son. A parent’s love shouldn’t be conditional on what genitals a kid has.”

It took me aback. I said, “I love kids and always wanted them, I just wasn’t sure and was stressed out. But it turned out fine, not sure why you’re upset.”

She said, “Well, I’m not sure why you told us you didn’t want a son. I would be sad if dad said that to me about having a daughter.”

My son said, “I’m not sad. It’s okay,” to his sister.

She said, “No, it’s not okay. There is a lot of hate for men/boys right now, but I want you to know I’d love a boy if I had kids one day, especially one like you.”

I genuinely rolled my eyes. I said, “There isn’t a lot of hate for men or boys, most people would love a boy. I never meant to insult my son, I felt comfortable saying it because it’s obvious that we’re close and I love him.”

My daughter doubled down and said, “It’s all over social media, specifically from women, but okay. If you love him so much don’t tell him to your face how you didn’t want him.”

I said, “Jesus, you are making a big deal out of nothing.” I swear it does feel she just wants to start a fight. She wants to be a lawyer and it’s obvious because she’s so argumentative.

My son was kinda like, “Please don’t fight,” so I let it go. But this girl genuinely frustrates me. She had to go start a fight over nothing. AITA here?

My girlfriend has a cat as well, and she will bring him over for a week at a time, and her cat does go into the windows, is commonly seen by neighbors and also spills drinks, chews (breaks) the blinds, jumps on tables and counters (including cabinets and the oven).

  I was worried about the charges for the broken blinds, pet fees, of even eviction and loosing my security deposit and it makes me think we aren’t keeping a close enough eye on him when he’s over so I suggested we either find a way to keep him out of the windowsill, keep him out of the kitchen where the windowsill is, or reduce how often he’s here all together so that we don’t have to worry about him when we aren’t in the apartment. I let her know I don’t want to feel like I have to watch her cat all the time and that worrying about these things makes me anxious.

  I told her all of this and she largely went quiet aside from originally fighting the argument to find alternatives by pointing out my roommates cat and mentioning that she was sure other people also have similar situations and aren’t caught by renters, but when I let her know that I already felt I was lenient in letting her cat be here for a week at a time when I already told her she could only keep him here days at a time when she originally brought him over she went quiet and said she needed time and space to think.

  I understand she doesn’t get to spend a lot of time with her cat when she wants to spend more time away from home, it’s why she brings her cat in the first place. Otherwise she forgets to take care of her cat and he has to stay in her room at home where he can’t move around as much. My girlfriend’s parents were threatening to get rid of her cat because he would scratch and meow and wasn’t too friendly with their dogs and they kept having to take care of him. My girlfriend even said she would pay for damages but when I mentioned the cost of the security deposit she said she wouldn’t be willing to pay that much.

  I love her, I love her cat, but she isn’t taking responsibility for her cats destruction when we aren’t around so I thought presenting solutions and reducing the time her cat is over was a good idea despite what I know about what her parents say about her cat at home.

136,1d1hwdn,AITA for not supporting my cousin's baby announcement?,"My (45f) younger cousin (30m) just announced that he is having a baby. He is a bit of a chav, and both him and his partner live with his mom. He has had previous children, which were taken away by family services due to abuse/neglect with a previous partner. He is sporadically employed and struggles with substance abuse, as does his partner.

His partner was pregnant previously, but miscaried in the 2nd trimester. The last time that I saw her she was visibly pregnant, and also visibly tipsy, smoking in the driveway. When she miscaried, I felt relief, but my family was very insistent that they needed to grieve, that they name the fetus, and they had a whole funeral for the fetus. I did not attend. My cousin did some crazy stuff after the miscarriage, and he has subsequently refused therapy, and his substance abuse has escalated (mostly alcohol and weed AFAIK, not hard drugs - though he has engaged in this previously).

After the miscariage, they learned that my cousin's partner would continue to be high risk of miscariage if pregnant again due to genetic factors. Her substance use/abuse has remained at its baseline levels AFAIK (which is not great, but at least not escalating). I think she is roughly my cousin's age, but I am not sure. Neither have completed highschool or held a job for long. They are also deeply in debt.

When my mother told me that my cousin's partner is pregnant again, I said nothing. I can tell that she is cross with me, but I can't bring myself to say congratulations. I was basically in shocked and appalled silence, not knowing how to respond without suggesting an abortion (which I know is not appropriate, and I generlally don't express opinions about other people's healthcare unless asked).

138,1d1h082,AITA? Friend is getting high on edibles every time we hang out and it's getting annoying.,"I have a very close friend of very many years and we hang out constantly. We pretty much consider eachother brothers and essentially grew up together. However starting about a year ago, he has become almost entirely dependent on edibles for relaxing late in the day. If I we don't hang out in person during the day, we usually play games online or I go over to his place. Now I don't mind marijuana or edibles at all. I actually smoke a bit here and there, but this guy takes it to a whole new level. He takes two or three edibles every single night, and is almost completely blacked out or is in the kitchen for thirty minutes at times looking for something to eat because he's high out of his mind. I just got off of a discord call with him a few minutes ago while we were playing a coop game because he was barely sentient during the entire call and he hasn't come back from the kitchen since he went AFK half an hour ago. He isn't even aware I'm not on the call anymore. I'm considering saying something to him about it because it's actually starting to get very annoying and there's no way this is healthy. 

Am I being unreasonable for leaving or accusing him of having a substance abuse problem? This is making it nigh impossible for us to hang out together anymore because he becomes essentially braindead until the following mornings. I'm pretty sure his girlfriend has said something to him about it as well because it's immediately apparent when he's taken edibles.",No A-holes here,2024-05-27,"AITA? Friend is getting high on edibles every time we hang out and it's getting annoying. I have a very close friend of very many years and we hang out constantly. We pretty much consider eachother brothers and essentially grew up together. However starting about a year ago, he has become almost entirely dependent on edibles for relaxing late in the day. If I we don't hang out in person during the day, we usually play games online or I go over to his place. Now I don't mind marijuana or edibles at all.
