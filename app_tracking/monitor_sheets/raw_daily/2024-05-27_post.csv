0,1d1i31m,AITA for not supporting all the choices my daughter made over her wedding weekend?,"My daughter, Anastasia, got married a week ago. In the months leading up to the event, she was understandably anxious, which her father and I tried to help her through as much as possible.

Originally, Anastasia planned on having a wedding weekend. She married on a Sunday but wanted everyone there that Thursday to kick off the weekend with a few activities. Most guests were coming from across the country. First, she changed the welcome barbecue to basically just cold cuts and chips, even when her dad and I offered to buy the stuff she originally promised. But she said no. Then she cancelled all the activities and said she was too stressed to do any of them. She said it was nothing the family did, just her stress. While I understood her side, I did also understand the side of her guests who were upset they spent all this money to come early, have accommodations for a full weekend and now, they had very little to do.

Then, a few members of the bridal party who had flown in out of state with plus ones stated they felt bad for their partners for basically abandoning them. They ended up skipping a few events because Anastasia had told them to treat Thursday and Friday as a vacation then took that back and expected them to ignore their partners.

Anastasia was pissed and began venting to me. I tried to be understanding at first. Eventually, she only had myself, her maid of honor and one bridesmaid attending a movie night she arranged. The bridesmaid ended up leaving early because she felt bad her partner had basically been cooped up in their hotel alone (there really isn‚Äôt a ton to do around here). She and the other bridesmaids promised they‚Äôd be there for the sleepover they had always planned for the night before the wedding so everyone could get ready together morning of.

After this, Anastasia threw a fit, saying she felt abandoned by most of her bridal party. Her maid of honor was reassuring her that she did the right thing and they were being assholes. They both looked to me and my husband for support. Eventually, I said I understood her bridesmaids. I also understood why our family was upset. While it‚Äôs understandable she‚Äôs stressed and why she didn‚Äôt want to do the originally planned events, she did cause a lot of people to waste money and time coming down here. As well as put her bridal party in an awkward position.

Anastasia refused to discuss it more. The rest of the weekend went on as she wanted. The wedding was beautiful and everyone had a good time. Then Anastasia and her husband went on a short honeymoon. They returned on Friday and we had dinner on Saturday. At one point, Anastasia confronted me privately and said I was wrong for not supporting her. She said I was supposed to be on her side. I said I would‚Äôve been but she was teetering on bridezilla territory. Just because it‚Äôs her special day doesn‚Äôt mean how she handled things was okay.

She insists that I was in the wrong for not backing her up. AITA?

1,1d1hnr5,AITA for telling my wife she‚Äôs gatekeeping my time when it comes to our kids and her emotions?,"Before we go into the situation, I (33M) own my own company, but the job requires me to be away from home for weeks at a time. When I am home it‚Äôs usually only for 4-5 days before leaving for work again. My wife (30F) is a SAHM who is often overstimulated and who just recently started her own small business. Now on with the situation.


So my wife text me this evening saying I may want call my daughter tomorrow and talk to her, because she‚Äôs had a rough day. According to her my daughter was tired our two boys were fighting and this caused my daughter to become upset and start crying for me. My wife being overstimulated didn‚Äôt let her call me so she could talk to me.  When I asked why my daughter wasn‚Äôt able to call me my wife responded with ‚ÄúI was overstimulated and just wanted them to go to sleep.‚Äù 

When I read the word ‚Äúoverstimulated‚Äù I called her.  My wife‚Äôs love language is affirmation and I‚Äôve learned that calling and giving her words of affirmation helps her calm down. We talk for several minutes with me telling her how great of a job she‚Äôs doing with the kids and with sales at her business. Because honestly she has been doing great with keeping the business up and holding down the home front. Then she asked, ‚Äúare you mad that I didn‚Äôt let her call you?‚Äù I said ‚Äúno but it does upset me when I find out one of my children was literally verbally crying for me but wasn‚Äôt allowed to call me.‚Äù

This caused her to blow up on me saying I don‚Äôt know what she goes through on a daily basis because I‚Äôm always gone for work and that she feels like I don‚Äôt respect her feelings as much as I do our children‚Äôs feelings. So I brought up that this wasn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs done this and asked her how it would make her feel if one of the kids were crying for her but weren‚Äôt allowed to call her. She again said I wasn‚Äôt considering her feelings. So I asked her why she doesn‚Äôt let them call me if they‚Äôve been ‚Äúbad‚Äù. And she replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hanging up now. I don‚Äôt appreciated being told I gate keep my kids phone time with their dad as a form of punishment or that your not respecting that I didn‚Äôt let her call because I was overstimulated. Call her in the morning.‚Äù And she hung up.

I never once downplayed the fact she was overstimulated. I just pointed out that I don‚Äôt want my kids to EVER feel like they can‚Äôt call me, when they need me to talk to them after a bad day, because it might cause someone else to be upset. So AITA?

TL;DR my wife didn‚Äôt let my daughter call me when my daughter was upset and is now mad that I implied she gate keeps their phone time with when she‚Äôs overstimulated or trying to punish them.

3,1d1hi4d,AITA for being indecisive about whether to attend my best friend of 15+ years wedding? ,"I 27 F, just started an intense 2 year healthcare school program. However, my bestfriend (we have been bestfriends since 6th grade) 28F is getting married on a Sunday this year. Basically, I just started this intense schooling program where more than one absence can get you expelled. I have waited 4 years to be accepted into this program and finally was accepted this year. My best friend, we will call her Emma, lives in a separate state (about 1,000 miles away), she is getting married on a Sunday later in the year. My school is Mon-Thursday 8 am- 4 pm.

I am her maid of honor and am expected to attend her bridal shower which is months before and is on a Saturday, which is no problem considering I have a full day to either fly or drive back home to make it to school the following Monday. 

Her wedding will be held at 3 pm on a Sunday and I am expected to be in class at 8 am that following Monday. The wedding venue is one hour from the nearest airport and driving would take 14 hours and flying would only take 3 hours but, if I miss the last flight out or god forbid my flight gets delayed/ canceled, and I miss school, I could get dismissed/ expelled.

Am I the asshole for considering not attending? (Keep in mind she is totally understanding about the whole thing) However, I just don‚Äôt know if my feelings/ anxiety about missing school are valid enough to miss her wedding. And I need to make up my mind soon so she can make the proper arrangements to replace me and add another bridesmaid. PLEASE give me your advice, I am desperate. Thank you

4,1d1hfg2,AITA for telling my husband not to drive my cousin home from work? ,"


My (29F) husband (30M) and I were friends since we were born so he was always around my family and everyone considered him another member, except my cousin. She (28)always had a crush on him and it was noticeable to everyone, I mean she was pretty obvious because they kissed a few times and she declared her love for him but he didn't reciprocate, and when we started dating at 18 she got depressed and stopped talking to me for weeks.  

Long story short, she got over it and started dating several men and even got married, and when that happened she moved close to us and wanted us all to be friends again like when we were kids but I don't feel comfortable with that because she doesn't give me good vibes. And the last straw was that she asked my husband if he could pick her up from work for a few days since her car is damaged. She asked him that because her job is close to his and he told me because he wanted me to tell him what to do because he doesn't feel comfortable with her either. So I told him no, and she told me that the Uber will cost too much money and I told her I'm sorry but my husband has to pick up the kids (8F, 5M, 3F) from school and if he picks her up he'll be late.

It was a pretty lame excuse but I hoped she would understand but she didn't, and she got angry and told me that I was being inconsiderate of my own family and that it was selfish.

5,1d1h8a9,AITA for not helping my depressed brother?,"I, (14 F) have a brother, (12 M) who I will call jake. While we don't have much in common, I would say that we are fairly close, and have a pretty good sibling relationship. Recently, however, me and my dad have been noticing him feeling down and overall demotivated, which my dad decided to diagnose as depression. My dad, fully believing he is depressed, talked to me about it to try and get me to help him by cheering him up, hanging out with him, etc. Often, I am busy with school and tests, but I try to be nicer and hang out with him more while being normal.  
This weekend, we were up at our upstate house as we have the long weekend and we have a pool there, my dad asked me to take jake to the pool and hang out with him to make him happier. The only problem being, is that, I have severe self-image issues and the only bathing suits at the house are 2-piece ones I last wore when I was 10, and it is horrible enough to try to fit into them to see if I even still fit, let alone be in a pool with them with people watching me. I am also extremely insecure about people looking at or touching me, etc. especially when I have less clothes on for personal reasons. My dad is unaware of this and I know he is unaware, nor am I keen on letting him know, however, I did tell him that I was not comfortable with getting in the pool for personal reasons and I was just overall uncomfortable with even the idea of it. I have said this many times before including mere hours before he asked me to join my brother in the pool. When I told him no repeatedly and stated I was uncomfortable with being in the pool, he didn't say anything except ""depression is a really scary thing and I'm worried for him"" with a look on his face that looked weary and slightly frustrated with me. I am aware of how dangerous depression is, seeing as I have had it and kept it hidden for 5 years. I am well aware that my brother may have depression and I am trying to help him however I can, and, while at the time, I thought that it was fine to not do it as I felt uncomfortable, I'm wondering if I'm really doing the right thing, putting my needs before his own.

6,1d1h70k,AITA for not inviting my friend to my wedding?,"I am getting married at a destination wedding with a very small group of guests‚Äî24 guests to be exact‚Äîwhich my family and closest friends will be attending.

My fianc√©‚Äôs family won‚Äôt be attending our destination wedding for reasons that won‚Äôt make a difference; however, my fianc√© and I are having a small lunch after our registry at a local restaurant for family and a couple of friends who are not attending our destination wedding.

We have communicated with some of the friends months prior to the invitation, mentioning the lunch is for those who won‚Äôt be attending the ceremony and reception overseas.

More than half of the guests for the lunch are family only. My friend Amy and her partner were invited to the lunch as they couldn‚Äôt go overseas. My friend Sarah was not invited to the lunch as she had RSVPed for the overseas wedding a few months prior.

Here is where the problem begins: Sarah got extremely upset with me because she wasn‚Äôt invited to the lunch even though she was going to the actual overseas wedding.

I texted her, called her, and apologised. It was never my intention to get her upset because of that, and I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. If my fianc√©‚Äôs family was attending our overseas wedding, this lunch wouldn‚Äôt even be happening.

I was able to get a spot at the restaurant for her; she said she wasn't sure if she would be able to attend as she might be working. Sarah has a great job, is financially stable, works two weeks per month, and has two weeks per month off.

Sarah messaged me a few days ago and told me she won‚Äôt be attending the overseas wedding anymore as her financial situation is compromised for X reasons. I said it was fine, and I understood if she couldn‚Äôt come as it's overseas and not everyone can go. I met up with Sarah and Amy two days after Sarah told me she wouldn't be coming for the overseas wedding, and Sarah was showing me that she bought this expensive handbag and pair of shoes (let's say those two items would have cost at least $10,000).

Yesterday my other friend Lana started organising my bachelorette party, and I messaged Sarah, asking if she would be able to attend and, if so, to share her schedule so Lana could organise something that was easy for Sarah. Sarah said to not get worried about her dates because she will most likely be working extra shifts.

I called Amy to ask if she knew if Sarah was upset with me because she hasn‚Äôt said anything, but it looked like she didn‚Äôt want to attend any of the events. Amy said she didn‚Äôt mention anything about being upset, but she wasn‚Äôt making me a priority when I didn‚Äôt prioritise her at my wedding. She was invited to the wedding but not for lunch as she was already going overseas. Amy asked her if Sarah was going to, at least for lunch, and she said she would be travelling overseas with her friend and she wouldn‚Äôt be changing the dates because of me and that I am not a good friend.

I met up with Sarah and Amy two days after Sarah told me she wouldn't be coming for the overseas wedding, and Sarah was showing me that she bought this expensive handbag and pair of shoes (let's say those two items would have cost at least $10,000).

Yesterday my other friend Lana started organising my bachelorette party, and I messaged Sarah, asking if she would be able to attend and, if so, to share her schedule so Lana could organise something that was easy for Sarah. Sarah said to not get worried about her dates because she will most likely be working extra shifts.

I called Amy to ask if she knew if Sarah was upset with me because she hasn‚Äôt said anything, but it looked like she didn‚Äôt want to attend any of the events. Amy said she didn‚Äôt mention anything about being upset, but she wasn‚Äôt making me a priority when I didn‚Äôt prioritise her at my wedding. She was invited to the wedding but not for lunch as she was already going overseas. Amy asked her if Sarah was going to, at least for lunch, and she said she would be travelling overseas with her friend and she wouldn‚Äôt be changing the dates because of me and that I am not a good friend.

Our friends had a cookout today to which my girlfriend and I were invited. We had to leave the cookout party early to pick up our cat from the vet. However on the way to the vet I realized we left our lawn chairs and my high noons at the party. I asked my girlfriend if we could pick up the cans before we head home with our cat. She wanted to go straight home as our cat hates car rides and vet told us to keep him unstressed. I agreed but asked if I could go get the cans right after we get home because I didn't want anyone to drink them. My girlfriend was okay with me leaving but then asked if I would pick up pretty litter before I went to grab my cans. I was pretty irritated at this because I don't think we need pretty litter. We could just look to see if the litter is moist. Furthermore it would be out of my way to grab the litter, bring it home and then get my cans. So I called her selfish for not valuing my time and how long it would take me to grab the cans and return home. Then I left to go grab my cans. She called me in hysterics for calling her selfish and not helping separate the cats and getting them set up with their own litter, water and food  in their own rooms. I felt she was being dramatic as I was going to be home in less than a half hour to help her. I told her she was being dramatic and she accused me of caring more about my high noons more than helping her.

8,1d1gt5u,AITA for not taking weight loss advice from my friend that lost 40lbs on Ozempic?,"I (25F) have been friends with Jackie (25F) since our freshman year in college. Jackie has been overweight for as long as I‚Äôve known her. I‚Äôve seen her struggled with her weight a lot, and in college, she was constantly going on fad diets and then quitting. However, last year, she went on Ozempic and started eating less because the drug made her feel ill. Combined with light exercise, she has lost over 40lbs and looks incredible. 

Recently, I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight that I‚Äôve been trying to lose. Jackie is understandably proud of her weight loss and has been trying to give me advice about how to manage cravings and losing weight through CICO (calories in, calories out). I‚Äôve been listening to it because she‚Äôs really passionate, but I haven‚Äôt been taking it. This wasn‚Äôt an issue until she noticed me taking advice from our mutual friend, Louisa (27F). Louisa has been relatively thin her entire life, but over the past few years, has gone from skinny-fat to building a considerable amount of muscle. I have been actively texting her for advice and copying her protein meals/workout routines, especially since she has my dream physique. 

Since I started taking Louisa‚Äôs advice, I‚Äôve been steadily losing weight. I hyped up Louisa‚Äôs gym routine and meal planning to basically all my friends, saying how great I‚Äôve been feeling and how her tips have really helped me. This led to Jackie asking me why I was taking Louisa‚Äôs advice but seemingly none of hers. I tried to make up excuses, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She told me that we‚Äôve been friends for so long that I should respect her enough to tell her the truth. Eventually, I said that because I was trying to lose weight naturally, I wanted to take advice from someone who also achieved their physique naturally.

Hearing this, Jackie got really mad. She said that I was discrediting all the hard work she had to do and that Ozempic wasn‚Äôt a miracle drug. She said I was judgemental and that she had genuinely good advice if I was open minded enough to listen to it. I feel bad for hurting her, but at the same time, I think she‚Äôs making a bigger deal out of this than she should be. I wasn‚Äôt judging her for taking Ozempic, but she wasn‚Äôt able to lose weight without it in the 7 years that I‚Äôve known her. I just wanted to take advice from someone with a healthier relationship with food.

I've been lucky to have a sucessful career in Tech the last few years whereas she started off wealthier in her career (and recently sold a house to buy a new property) but has chosen to follow her passion (less lucrative as a ceramist). We've been not as close the last few years with us living in different cities and I've tried a ton but she often says shes bad with keeping in touch if people aren't in the same city, this has left me feeling hurt but I've tried to understand. I got married towards the tailend of covid so our dream wedding venue (5 star hotel) gave us a huuuuge 70% off discount on a wedding so we thought why not do it! It ended up being quite flashy which we were a bit embarassed about given we're both from humble beginnings. My best friend said she would like to make me something and I was really excited. At the wedding (I was mostly distracted being the bride) she seemed quiet and not herself. She isn't into fancy things and looks down at anything she perceives to be capitalism or materialistic. She didnt seem happy for me at all and wasn't her usual happy-go-lucky life of the party which bummed me out a bit.

After the wedding, she said all the right things but she never made me a ceramics pieces and she was the only guest to not give anything to our honeymoon fund. It's been 1.5 years and it still bothers me. Its also on top of struggling to stay close (me trying one way) and her not seeming to care much about me.

12,1d1gj0k,AITA for attending a Memorial Day pool party but not church,"I (18F) was just recently put on birth control two weeks ago. As I‚Äôm sure all of you know, birth control comes with a laundry list of side effects, especially when your body is first acclimating to the hormones. One of those side effects I have been cursed with is debilitating nausea and vomiting.

My father (43M) is extremely religious and has forced me and my siblings since birth to go to church and adhere to its absurdly strict modesty rules. The only time we are really allowed to miss church is due to sickness or travel that is out of our control. (I, while also religious, don‚Äôt agree with the doctrine of the church we currently go to and will be looking for another one once I move for college. My dad doesn‚Äôt know this.)

Anyway, today was the usual routine. Get up, get dressed, and go to church. We get there and I am hit with a wave of that terrible nausea that has been haunting me for the past two weeks, so I run to the bathroom and throw up. Afterwards, I find my dad and tell him that I need to leave because of said vomiting episode, and he lets me. However, our pastor‚Äôs wife (We call her Bobo because she‚Äôs literally one of the sweetest people ever) overheard and before I hit the door invited me to a little pool party for Memorial Day that she was throwing at her house after church, and that she was praying for me to feel better so I could make it, and she bought me some pineapple to have at the party since I am allergic to watermelon (see told you she‚Äôs the sweetest). I told her I would take some medicine and rest and try to be there if I‚Äôm feeling better by then.

Cut to after church. I took some medicine and felt better so I got dressed and went to the party. I ran into my dad first after getting there and he asked what I was doing there. I told him that I was feeling better and Bobo bought me a pineapple so I was there to eat it and have a good time.

(Ik there shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúreputations‚Äù when it comes to church but unfortunately that‚Äôs how it is at ours)

Now here‚Äôs where I might be TA. I told him that I don‚Äôt care about his reputation and that I was going to enjoy myself and entered the party anyway. I did enjoy myself but my dad made himself scarce.

However, I know what it‚Äôs like to be judged by a church. Bobo may not judge but that doesn‚Äôt account for the rest of the church. (I‚Äôm a bit of a black sheep in not only my church but also my family). So I understand if you have a good reputation with the church, why you would want to uphold it.

13,1d1gg2m,AITA for not talking much during my old friend's marriage?,"I'm writing this because I need some unbiased point of views about it and I'll use fake names for privacy. Some days ago, I (21F) traveled along with my parents for an old friend (20F) marriage, Hope. We used to be close when we were kids but we lost contact and didn't talked at all for almost a decade, but our parents remained friends. There wasn't any fight or drama between us, she just moved far away and we lost contact.



Her family is religious and in their church, if you're dating, you have to marry asap. She started dating last year and now has married. The point is my behaviour during the traveling days made my parents get angry at me. I'm not a very talkative person, I'm more introverted and sometimes, it's hard, it's like I have to prepare myself before talking. I do talk with my close friends, but Hope and I aren't friends anymore to be honest.



I'm not saying it in a mean way. We just didn't talked for almost a decade and we grew very different. The problem is both our parents didn't seem to understand this and started to basically demand we hug and talk. We tried but we don't have much in common. I also don't like being touched, especially frequently, and I know her mother didn't mean any harm, she's a wonderful person, but she touched me a lot, kissing and hugging me all the time and I just kinda froze. She also wanted me to eat a lot and I just couldn't (literally) but my parents continued to enable her to make me eat even when they knew I was about to throw up.



I've talked with them about it when we were alone and they said they were angry at me for not being happy and that Hope's mom was just being nice which I don't disagree in the last part. After it, they started to compare me with Jane's (their other friend) son, saying that they should marry us and, because, I quote, ""the two of you are anti social weirdos"".



For context: Hope's mom, Jane and my parents are all friends. Jane's son, Ed, normally doesn't talk much to people and hides in his room. He never got therapy for long enough for a diagnostic but it's said he might have PTSD and depression due three robberies some years ago. He never really got the right treatment and still suffers with the trauma, but everyone, even his parents, downplays it.



In the wedding's night, I didn't talked much, altough I tried and prepared myself to try talking. When Hope talked with me, I shook her hand and congratulated her in a low tone of voice. We just talked for like 2 minutes because she had to talk with the other guests. When we got alone, my mother got furious at me saying I barely talked and I embarassed her so much it k-word her out of shame. My dad also said he was disappointed and that I need to learn how to communicate better.



I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with, but I've tried, I really tried. My parents keep saying I'm TA for not speaking much in the wedding or during the travel at all.

after when i was waiting for a ride back to my dad's, i put on a show i like where the main characters are brothers. it was fine until she said one of them was cuter, i laughed and said they looked the same to me because i don‚Äôt like men. she tried to show me the difference, saying one of the character‚Äôs foreheads were akin to that of a ""monkey"" or ""neanderthal."" my little brother and i told her that was rude, but she and my stepdad defended her by saying it wasn‚Äôt harmful because the actor didn‚Äôt hear it. we both tried to tell her that those kinds of comments are in poor taste anyway.

she then tried to say my comment about them looking the same was like saying all black people look the same, which i denied, because it was about my own sexuality, not the subject‚Äôs race. she then said it was sexist against men which i also denied, and she asked if i was saying you couldn't be sexist against men like i say you can't be racist towards white people. this made my stepdad (patriotic type) join in, and i tried to explain to both of them how racism goes further than just mean words.

A year and a half ago, there was a fire caused by someone on the other half of the duplex. The house was destroyed. We lost a lot, but luckily Addie was okay.

We temporarily moved in with my brother‚Äôs family. They were amazing to us. The kids loved Addie. 

It soon became clear that our landlord was going to have to tear down the duplex and rebuild as the damage was that bad. We needed to find a new place to live. After endless searching, we realized all the vacancies that we could afford in our area didn‚Äôt allow cats. My brother and SIL generously offered to keep Addie while we tried to get off the waitlist at a pet friendly apartment. In the past year and a half, we‚Äôve visited their home frequently and have gotten to see Addie. 

To add, if it matters, my brother‚Äôs family began financially taking care of her. Including vet bills, food, etc. They refused to take our money. 

The more time that passed, I knew the odds of us being able to take Addie back were slim. My SIL works from home so Addie‚Äôs gotten used to someone being around. Whereas my wife and I work in offices in a different city. The kids were also growing more attached. I tried to have this conversation with my wife multiple times but she was in denial.

Last month, we finally got off the waitlist for a better apartment that allows pets. My wife instantly called my brother to ask about Addie. He asked that we meet with him and his wife for dinner. 

As I expected, they asked if they could keep Addie. They said they had grown attached to her. That the kids would have a hard time but they felt Addie would too as she‚Äôd gotten used to them and their lifestyle. I have to admit, Addie does seem happy there.

My wife started to protest but I said we‚Äôd think about it. At home, I told her this was for the best. She got pissed and said she wants Addie back. That we had a deal. I said we need to think about what‚Äôs best for Addie and also what‚Äôs fair to everyone.

Ultimately, she reluctantly agreed. We still see Addie, but my wife acts different when we‚Äôre there. Sometimes I feel she resents my brother and his family for keeping Addie. But she won‚Äôt discuss it. Recently, a friend asked if we‚Äôd ever get another cat. My wife said no as she feels I‚Äôd just give it away again.

She didn't interest me at first and there was no way I was going to approach a new student. We actually grew closer after I asked for a pen via one of my friends.

We shared everything but had very apparent differences. She was the talkative extroverted person and I was the quiet introverted one, I liked reading and didn't like trends while she was more into watching movies and was aware of everything on the internet. After some time, we exchanged homemade gifts for our birthdays.

I noticed something was off with her and she seemed sick. She ghosted me for hours and only responded to my messages when I gave her the homework but I decided to brush it off thinking that she'll come talk to me if she needed to. When she was online, my friend was too: the one who asked for the pen years ago (that friend was very social with others but seemed to only like me sometime and hate me when they didn't get better grades than me. I think it was because of the pressure since we both had stricts parents. I'm kind of a straight A student)

I noticed she was avoiding me at school and only spent time with my friend. I started to spend more time alone and was getting jealous of all the attention my friend was having from her. When I tried to enter their conversations, they would always switch topics and left me aside during breaks but my friend's bestfriend decided to keep me company. I knew from my friend's face that it didn't please them at all. My bestfriend's birthday was near and I was preparing a necklace. I gave it to her Tuesday since her birthday was Thirsday.

I found the exact same necklace hanging around my friend's neck the next day. I confronted her about it and her sole excuse was: she wanted it so I gave it to her. I snapped. I just yelled at her for ignoring my existence 4 months and ghosting me just to hang out with someone else without telling me if something actually bothered her. She shouted at me accusing me of not caring about her feelings, saying that her grandfather was in poor health how she was stressed at home and I was a bad friend to not care.

I decided to not engage a converstaion with her anymore after that because of the guilt I felt. I still got an invitation to her birthday but I refused to come to the party. The drama extended but with the rumours about me, most sided with them. I had the solid proof with message and everything but didn't do anything because I didn'tI want bad things to happen to her. The rumors got worse accusing me of betrayal and how bad I was to her. The worst part is that my friend kept telling her bestfriend to not approach me, told her I was toxic and every friendship I had got ruined because of me.

It actually hurted. When I didn't show up at the party, more whispers were heard in the hallways.

Am I a bad friend for not supporting her even after she told me about her situation?",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-27,"AITA for not going to my best friend's party after a dispute? I'm pretty young and have poor social skills since I get too anxious to talk but I made a bestfriend 3 years ago. She didn't interest me at first and there was no way I was going to approach a new student. We actually grew closer after I asked for a pen via one of my friends.

We shared everything but had very apparent differences. She was the talkative extroverted person and I was the quiet introverted one, I liked reading and didn't like trends while she was more into watching movies and was aware of everything on the internet. After some time, we exchanged homemade gifts for our birthdays.

I noticed something was off with her and she seemed sick. She ghosted me for hours and only responded to my messages when I gave her the homework but I decided to brush it off thinking that she'll come talk to me if she needed to. When she was online, my friend was too: the one who asked for the pen years ago (that friend was very social with others but seemed to only like me sometime and hate me when they didn't get better grades than me.

24,1d1err6,"AITA for telling ""f*ck u"" to my dad, his partner and my aunt on Facetime?","I'm (30F) going through a migration since November 2023. Because of the economical crisis, I didn't have a stable job or prospects in my country. I'm college educated and have a working VISA in the country of destination. I knew it would be difficult to make it so far away from everything and everyone I know, but I decided to try and take the risk. 
So I was chatting with my dad, his partner and my aunt about this and I was telling them about how difficult it is to get a job. I've been through a thousand interviews but still nothing. This is very scary because I only have money to sustain myself till July. It's also very frustrating, I'm under a lot of pressure right now.
I was telling them about the time I got rejected in an interview because I don't have a car or license, and they got all crazy about it. They told me I should have lied, I should have said I had a car and then figure it out. Then they called me dumb because I didn't think of it.
I got so mad at this that I yelled at them that the job wasn't even that good (it was low payment and I was supposed to work late night shifts -I explained this to them) and f*ck them if they were going to call me dumb.
They told me I was too sensitive and that I should work it out if I wanted to get a job.
