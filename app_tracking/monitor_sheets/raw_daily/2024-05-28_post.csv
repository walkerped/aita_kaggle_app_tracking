41F and my friend is a 42F. Went swimming with a friend yesterday. We had gone shopping the day before and my friend had gotten a cute dress. While we were lounging, I raved about my friend’s dress and how good it looked on her. She was a little self conscious because she’s well-endowed and it wasn’t really covering her chest the way she wanted.

Late in the afternoon, after I tried to help her adjust the straps to no avail, she turned to me and said, “I don’t think it’s going to work for me, would you like it since you don’t have any boobs.”

I’m a transwoman (and a relatively new one) and my friend has always known that I struggle with body image issues, particularly about the size of my chest. After she said it, I let me friend know the remark stung a little and that it had hurt my feelings. I didn’t get loud or rude, I just calmly stated it without making it a big deal.

My friend proceeded to rip me apart and tell me how I was overly sensitive and couldn’t take a joke. She told me how ridiculous I was being and how she wouldn’t apologize because she has seen me say mean things about people (not to them, just about them).

I’m hurt and confused. I tried to just let the issue go, but honestly it makes me feel really insecure being around my friend and I feel like she doesn’t really care how her words or actions impact me.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-05-28,"AITA - Feelings Got Hurt, Friend Says I Have No Bewbs AITA

Not gonna say it’s not at all my fault but no 5 year old was eating enough to be 145 lbs ya know? I’m also chronically ill and disabled.

 My dad has always been. Well he’s been. He’s supported me and my mother financially as well as he could by working as a long haul trucker since I was about 6. So he was never really around and I never developed a true relationship with my dad. Now my dads “love language” is teasing and poking fun at you and while I can take it to a certain extent I’ve tried to make it clear that we don’t have the type of relationship where I’m okay with him making fat jokes at my expense.

 His comments do hurt me deeply and I’ve tried to make that clear without being a jerk but he always ignores me or calls me sensitive. On top of that he refuses to use my proper name and pronouns since coming out but I’m not gonna fight him on that. Still hurts tho. Well this last week he was “teasing” me about my snack choices and basically I told him to “f*ck off” about my eating habits. I guess that hurt his feelings and now I’m being guilt tripped by my mom and grandma. The same ones who’ve watched me sob and ask why my dad hates me so much. Anyway. AITA or should I apologize?

4,1d29nnz,AITA for refusing to return someone’s car keys,"Some friends and I went to the lake for Memorial Day. I prepared a lot of snacks, drinks, and other things so we have whatever we could need for a lake day. One of the people in our group, let’s call him Jake, brought nothing. Nada! He didn’t even know if he should bring a swimsuit or a towel! The only thing he did was drive us to the lake. We met up with some other friends there and we all got settled in. Jake and friend #1 began drinking, heavily. We were supposed to leave by 3pm. That was the hard cut off time to leave the lake what we all agreed to. 
When 3 came around, we began to pack up. My friend and Jake  got invited to go on a strangers boat at that time. I told them we are leaving and they decided to stay behind. My friend came up to our tent area and took her and Jake’s stuff to friend #2, who got there later than us. Me and the others packed up and left. It’s important to note that there is no signal at the lake. When I got home, I unpacked and I found  Jake’s keys in my bag. I never put those keys in my bag. I didn’t know those keys were in my bag. I tried getting in touch with the friends still at the lake to tell them I had his keys but I didn’t get a response.
I got frustrated because I wasn’t the one who got drunk and got on some strangers boat. I don’t think I should be responsible for Jake’s lack of planning as well as extreme drunkenness. I had a lot of work to do when I got home from the lake so I wasn’t  going to go back and give him the keys. I also think giving the keys back would have been a terrible idea since friend #1 and Jake were intoxicated. 
Friend #2 was there was the only one who could get ahold of me. She asked me to bring the keys and I replied that I wouldn’t. I also should note friend #2 took an Uber to the lake with her friends and they didn’t have a ride back. She got angry at me for not coming back. I told her that she should get an Uber or ask someone to take them. Eventually, friend #1 and Jake were able to get a ride from a stranger. I met them to give Jake’s keys back. They were then able to go back to the lake from another friend’s sister and get Jake’s car. 
Now Jake and friend #2 is angry at me. Friend #1 knows that the situation was frustrating for all of us and isn’t mad at me. I could have gone back, but to me, it’s the principle.

5,1d29bw3,AITA for telling my (ex) best friend my opinion about her (ex) boyfriend?,"This is a long story made very short! Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.

I (F18) have been best friends with a girl we will call Ally (F17) for 15 years. Ally and I have always been very close friends and our biggest flex was that we never fought.

However, when Ally and her (now ex) boyfriend (M17) got together, things changed. This is expected of course and I have been in a relationship for three years so I understand the adjustment. But, when Ally got a job, she spent all of her free time with her boyfriend. The time she did spend with me consisted of constant complaining about how tired she was and how she never got to see her boyfriend. I never got to hear anything else about her life. Despite Ally always talking down on girls who ditched their best friends for their boyfriends, she was now that girl, so we drifted a lot.

It was like this for a few months. During the peak of this, Ally went on a trip and returned to a nasty break-up text from her boyfriend. She immediately texted me for support, which I provided as I knew how much she loved him despite her distancing herself from me.

This is when it all goes downhill really fast. My high school graduation was now here and my boyfriend was kind enough to take her as his ""date"" to our events. The whole time she was mopey about her ex and how he was there but she could not talk to him. A week later, she was messaging me about how her ex was the only one who was there for her. I said ""Well I am here for you just as much"" and she flipped out and claimed I did not know anything that was going on in her private life and that I never noticed her crying at school. Keep in mind, that we have not spoken for months but I still loved her just as much. I apologized and said I did not know how she was feeling and all that, as I was truly sorry.

A month later, Ally asked me, unprompted, what my opinions were on her ex and if they should get back together. I have never spoken my mind about him, or anything really, to her, and even now I restrained myself. I said, ""He has done some bad things and has hurt you, so I am not sure"". And she lost it. She said that she knew I would respond like this and that I never supported her. Since this, things have been tense and awkward. I moved away for university, and she has barely cared. She has confronted me about how she has been feeling but does not seem to want to fix anything, just picks a fight.

6,1d29b8j,AITA for not paying for my girlfriend's rent (Financial responsibilities in a relationship),"Apologies for wordiness, as this includes both the issue in the title as well as some more general, related incidents.

My (25M) girlfriend (26F) of three years is going to be moving into a summer sublease next week. We looked at a few places for her and she was split between two places in the same town. One is a room in a shared house with 2 other people (co-ed) and the other is a studio apartment that costs 60 more per month. She thought that the studio would be more comfortable and make her feel safer than living in a co-ed space with strangers for roommates, but really did not want to pay the extra 60 dollars per month. I wanted her to feel safer so I offered to cover the additional 60 for her so that she would not have to have such a tough decision, while also helping me feel more secure with her living situation. She was pretty happy about this arrangement and signed the lease.

She recently had a conversation with a new friend (who I don't know very well) and told her friend that I was helping her cover 60 dollars of her 800 dollar rent. Her friend apparently scoffed at her and said ""Only 60""? Now she is upset at me because she says that I'm being cheap/stingy for only covering 60 dollars of her rent, where a ""good boyfriend"" (according to her friend) should cover at least 100 dollars, if not half to all of the rent. She says that since I would be coming over to help her out and to hang out at her place, I should be paying more since I would be using the space too. 

I told her that I thought that was a stupid reason and that she should be grateful that I'm even covering any rent at all for her, since I won't be living there (I currently pay rent to my parents to live with them, since I am working part time and studying full-time at my graduate program, and can't realistically afford to move out at the moment). This spiraled our conversation into something else. She began to say that if she ever needed to count on me to pay for her, I'd be useless. She brought up a recent vacation she took with some friends, where she was a few hours late to arrive to her destination because her flight was delayed and she did not want to pay a hundred plus to change flights. She said that she can't count on me to pay for her changed flight. I am confused because I feel like it shouldn't be my responsibility to help her change a flight so that she can get to her vacation (which I was not a part of) a few hours earlier. I want to be a good boyfriend to her, but I honestly do not know whether things like this are a part of a boyfriend's ""normal"" responsibilities or if she is trying to take advantage of me. 

TLDR: Girlfriend is mad that I am not paying for more of her rent (for an apartment that I will not be living at). Girlfriend has been resentful of me for similar situations of me being stingy/cheap. I am kind of stupid and don't really know if these sorts of expenses are normal for a boyfriend to cover, but feel like I'm not in the wrong here.

He's reserved, but he cares a lot about the family and works hard to support us. He does have a few conservative opinions, but it's more a culture thing than anything else. He wants me to go to college.

A few months ago I was forcibly outed as queer to him, and it shocked him so much that he essentially told me to get out, after an uncharacteristic screaming match and fight. Whatever happened, I absolutely injured him too, and I regret it. I did get out, and I've been living with my aunt (28) since. He hasn't contacted me at all, which is upsetting because we had such a good relationship. This came out of nowhere.

I don't know if he knows where I am, or what I'm doing, or what's going to become of my future. Insane how quickly he threw away 16 years of investment. He was even ready to pay for my college. I've tried talking to him so many times, but he doesn't respond to any messages or calls. Apparently he's told my sister not to contact me anymore.

While he was at work last week, my sister invited me over (against his wishes) to pick up some of my things. I've been gradually moving out. Purely on impulse, I took the only picture of my dead grandfather he had, hanging on the kitchen wall. My dad was very close to his father, and was devastated when he died. My grandfather, living in extreme poverty, saved enough to send my dad to college and struggled all his life for his kids. One of the few times I've ever seen my dad show real emotion was when he hung up this picture. So it was probably needlessly cruel of me to take it, though it was satisfying.

My sister says my dad actually cried after he saw the picture was gone. I don't know if it's from stress or this, and I don't think he knows I was the one who took it. She says he's still searching for it when he gets the time. If I return it now he will no doubt try to fight again and all hope of him ever talking to me again would be out the window.

9,1d293sb,AITA for eating leftovers before my narcissistic dad could? ," For extra insight into this, I, (19F) and my mom, (56F), just got back from a concert that happened last night when we spent the night over in another city. 

 We got back this afternoon after we had lunch and hung out with some friends who also went to said concert and when we got back we had two trays of food from our respective plates. Flash forward to about four hours later and I finally get up to eat my plate of food, only for my dad to get up from the couch at the same time and say he wanted food too. He waited until I plated the food and then put it in the microwave to start talking to my (24F) autistic sister to thank her for saving food for him. I didn’t hear what he was saying and gave a laugh at something I’d knocked over and he proceeded to look directly at me and say, “Yeah the one smirking over there.” Referring to me. 

 I was stunned, though I should have expected this as he does things of this caliber all the time, repeatedly and it’s caused a strain on my parent’s marriage for about two decades now. I proceeded to ask him directly if he wanted food, though he was already making some of his own and had already said earlier that he didn’t want any, anyways. 

 This back and forth had me seething in moments, I admit, and I was very aggressive each time I replied to him, and he went as far to just all together deny he ever said he declined my offer. That led to a stand off, where I left my food in the microwave as it was heating up and left to cool my head. I came back only when we went outside to feed our animals and snuck away like I’d done something bad. I wouldn’t have felt like I had to make a post, but he even checked the microwave to see if I’d left the food and slammed the door when he didn’t find it. I’m sick to my stomach, and this isn’t the first time he’s made me feel like this. 

 Am I the asshole for eating my own food my mother bought for me and blowing it out of proportion, or is there something I should be worried about? 

edit: I want to clarify how I just want some closure for how I feel and some insight as to what could be wrong with me or my father. If it’s a relationship thing or if it’s something else. I should also add, it was not just one question to me and I was angry, it was a slew of “well I said I was hungry,” and “I didn’t say I didn’t want any food,” from my father. I really enjoy the feedback that he could be joking, but by no means has my relationship with my father ever been normal and he cannot even hug me normally, if that provides any more insight into how messed up our relationship is.

11,1d28yud,AITA: A Woman and her Husband Walk into a Restaurant…,"Well…not quite like that. For context: my husband and I are on our honeymoon - today is the first day. I unfortunately am in a bad financial space and until a deposit enters my account (tomorrow) I only have $15 to my name - my husband knows this and just a few days ago expressed anger at me that we might not be able to do things on the trip because my financial situation is holding us back. I reiterated to him that once I get paid (after the first day) I will have more than enough to cover the trip and fun experiences.

 Fast forward to today (first day)- a local woman recommends a particular restaurant. Husband had looked it up previously and agreed he wanted to go so I was up for it too. Irregardless of the price, I wanted to go because I didn’t want him to miss out on a nice dinner bc I couldn’t afford it. For reference, we have always paid separately for things and it works for us. So my husband drops me off at the restaurant and circles the block to park. Meanwhile, I get us a table and look at the menu. The following text exchange then takes place:
 
Me: the cheapest starter here is $28. This is a nice place..
H: ok. Too much? Open to other fish options nearby
Me: I’m already sitting down - you can come and eat :) I just prob won’t get anything 
H: Well then find another option cheap pants 🙂 it’s just food…I just want fish
Me: I feel really awkward now bc a couple people have helped me and poured us water. Hahah
H: Run away?
Me: just get here when you can and we can decide. The menu looks good!

Again - given our previous convo, I just wanted him to see the menu so as not to miss out on a nice meal just bc I couldn't. So he enters the restaurant and sits down/starts observing the menu. I tell him again that I’m not getting anything but he’s more than welcome to. He then starts shaking his head and says “We take this $6k trip and then this…”. (Side note - all of this was paid for by wedding gift $). I’m now starting to get upset. The waiter walks back up to take our order and he orders a small dish and a drink. I kindly decline to order anything. Now my husband is visibly upset with me and won’t talk to me, though I am attempting convo with him. He said he was more uncomfortable with just him ordering than he would have been just getting up and leaving. I told him I gave him the out but I wanted him to see the menu. We awkwardly sat there for the next 20 minutes while he ate his meal and then left. 

This then escalated into a huge argument, him saying I should have left before he got there and me saying I wish he would have told me that he wasn’t going to want anything if I didn’t order anything. Again, given our previous convo, I didn’t want him to miss out just bc of my financial situation. Replaying again and again, I can’t figure out what I would have done different. AITA?

UPDATE: I've gotten a lot of ESH feedback so I appreciate the opinions! What I could have done differently is looked at the menu before going in and letting him know that I wouldn't get anything.

Hi reddit! 
    So first off; my fiance and I are newly engaged as of January and we have a very loving relationship. In fact we HARDLY ever argue or fight about things, he and I are exact opposites in personality but have the same interests. 2 years ago, we opened up a small business and run the business from our home. We use a computer my fiance built from his gaming days that he had been using in his music studio. He is a producer, but has been taking a break. Well as of this year my Fiance has been requesting we purchase a business computer or use my laptop from college  to use for our small business so he can return back to his music and gaming. I have no problem with that and would love to see him make music again, however as of right now it isn't in our business funding to purchase a new computer and he's told me he understands that we need to save up for it. Well this is now May almost June and the computer has been a discussion every other week. Where he reminds me he wants his computer and I remind him we need to save up or purchase a new one from our personal accounts.    
     Beginning this tax season, My Fiance and I agreed for him to take care of the books since he wanted to be involved in the financing, going against the fact I have a degree in business and am educated in the accounting and filing department well enough to be able to create a ledger. Any ways, today I brought up the fact the expense report, the sales, etc. Basically the entire ledger hasn't even been started yet and they NEED done and that he agreed for responsibility of those items. I gave him til the end of this month (4 days) to get it done so I can get an idea of where we are as a business for this year. He didn't like that I gave him an ultimatum,  so he brought up the computer. He said he doesn't understand how I can give him an ultimatum on reports if he hasn't given me an ultimatum on the computer. Shortly after our argument, he left for his parents for a memorial day get together and I stayed to work on business stuff (orders that came in earlier). 
     While he was gone, I unhooked his computer and put it in his man cave for him, and now have my college laptop set up in the office area. However the problem is I was in college a long time ago, this laptop is from 2014 and I'm 28 years old. So it's very outdated which my fiance knew before all of this and was aware that's why we needed to just purchase a new desktop. He came back home to me sitting on the laptop trying to just open our email, I had been waiting for an hour already for the laptop to just update after powering on.  We got into a huge fight after that and he says I wanted to make him feel sorry for me by swapping the computer out for my laptop, which isn't true. I told him I'm sick of hearing about the computer when he knows why we haven't got a new one yet. AITA for being so stubborn about the situation?",Asshole,2024-05-28,"AITA for being stubborn?

Also I don't want to talk overly bad about Ella to my friends because that's so humbling.) Something to note is that during the relationship, she cared a lot who I spoke to. 

While Ella and I were together she came to a couple of parties with friends of mine but mostly kept to herself so she never established friendships with any of my friends. We do share one close mutual friend, “Polly” who originally introduced us and who we are both still on good terms with.

This was the first time that Ella and Christine properly met, and they seemed to get along. Ella started making plans for them to hang out later this week in front of me and Polly which we both thought was rude since they were talking across Polly and didn't make any effort to include her.

For reference my friend Christine is straight and Ella has a new girlfriend so this is a platonic hangout.

basically i grew up in a very strict cuban household. My dads emotionally abusive n is constantly manipulating me and my mother. he’s cheated on her multiple times n prohibits her from working and doing certain things (long story short he’s controlling tf outta her). my mom knows of this behavior as he treats her like shit yet she never says anything. 

my dad is a control freak n doesn’t let me do ANYTHING. i can’t have my phone after 12, can’t close the door when i have friends over, can’t go out w my friends even if their parents are going (either my friends go out w us or i don’t see them), can’t join any sports in school simply because he “doesn’t want me to”, finds literally everything disrespectful (hugged my man infront of him n he said i need to have some self respect), etc etc. my breaking point was yesterday. 

my parents had invited my bf to come w us to the beach since we go every year. mind u my bf is a very respectful person who has done nothing but treat my family very nicely yet they somehow find a way to talk shit abt him. we had nicely asked if we could sleep in the same bed (there’s 2 beds in the hotel room n i have a brother. my parents had brought the air mattress for my bf to sleep in, but we rlly wanted to sleep in the same bed n didn’t see the harm in it as we js wanted to cuddle eachother comfortably until we fell asleep) n my parents LOST IT. they made it a huge deal n called me various names (disrespectful ones too) saying that i have no self respect n im a whore, simply because i wanted to sleep w my bf. 

my dad then proceeded to stay up ALL NIGHT watching my bf like a hawk to see if one of us would go to eachothers bed. it was very disturbing. not only that, my mom also took it upon herself to take my bfs PHONE and put it on the tv table infront of him, which is also disrespectful. on the way back home after dropping my bf off at his house they proceeded to tell me that if i lose my virginity ill get kicked out. don’t know how we went from falling asleep w my bf in the same bed to me losing my virginity, but ok. 

i already lost my virginity (YES YES IK IM ONLY 15) so im debating if i should tell them n see what happens. i know how this seems like he is just trying to protect me, but please understand that my father is a very controlling abusive man with a bad history. it’s one thing to be protective and another to be borderline controlling. there are times where i dont even feel safe in this house.",Asshole,2024-05-28,"AITA for wanting to leave my house at 15 years old?

my dad is a control freak n doesn’t let me do ANYTHING. i can’t have my phone after 12, can’t close the door when i have friends over, can’t go out w my friends even if their parents are going (either my friends go out w us or i don’t see them), can’t join any sports in school simply because he “doesn’t want me to”, finds literally everything disrespectful (hugged my man infront of him n he said i need to have some self respect), etc etc. my breaking point was yesterday. 

my parents had invited my bf to come w us to the beach since we go every year. mind u my bf is a very respectful person who has done nothing but treat my family very nicely yet they somehow find a way to talk shit abt him. we had nicely asked if we could sleep in the same bed (there’s 2 beds in the hotel room n i have a brother. my parents had brought the air mattress for my bf to sleep in, but we rlly wanted to sleep in the same bed n didn’t see the harm in it as we js wanted to cuddle eachother comfortably until we fell asleep) n my parents LOST IT. they made it a huge deal n called me various names (disrespectful ones too) saying that i have no self respect n im a whore, simply because i wanted to sleep w my bf. 

my dad then proceeded to stay up ALL NIGHT watching my bf like a hawk to see if one of us would go to eachothers bed. it was very disturbing. not only that, my mom also took it upon herself to take my bfs PHONE and put it on the tv table infront of him, which is also disrespectful. on the way back home after dropping my bf off at his house they proceeded to tell me that if i lose my virginity ill get kicked out. don’t know how we went from falling asleep w my bf in the same bed to me losing my virginity, but ok. 

i already lost my virginity (YES YES IK IM ONLY 15) so im debating if i should tell them n see what happens. i know how this seems like he is just trying to protect me, but please understand that my father is a very controlling abusive man with a bad history. it’s one thing to be protective and another to be borderline controlling. there are times where i dont even feel safe in this house.",1.0,-0.012706611,0,0
16,1d28m9v,AITA for telling my friend I don’t want to have child friendly meet ups anymore,"My friend Daisy (32F) and I (33F) are both child less and meet up regularly for coffee or lunch. Daisy has a 3 year old niece who she babysits often and now that she’s of the age she can take out more easily she’s started bringing her to our meet ups. 

Initially I assumed this was just an occasional thing when she wasn’t going to be available to meet up otherwise so I didn’t mind too much. It was a bit of a novelty at first and I like children. However this became a regular thing eventually and the meet ups became more and more child orientated, with the timings and location dictated by what was best for her niece. And also during the whole time together it was inevitably taken over by Daisy’s niece’s needs, her being sleepy, hungry, thirsty, needing the toilet, getting upset, playing up etc. All normal expected stuff from a child, but not normal for two child less women to revolve their meet ups around and it started to basically feel like I was getting tricked into babysitting as well in all my social time. 

Eventually recently when Daisy messaged about meeting up at a cafe next to her niece’s nursery so that she can pick her up and meet me there I replied saying it might be better if we tried to meet at the times she’s not babysitting so that she can enjoy the time as well and can keep her time with her niece as quality time with her. 

She replied back annoyed and seemingly angry saying children aren’t something you can just put aside and that she doesn’t have time to meet without her niece, and then asked me what will I do when I have children of my own, which is utterly bizarre as it’s not the same comparison. 

Additional Info - I know Daisy’s brother personally too and he has a very good marriage and they adore their child. From what I’ve gathered since their daughter was born Daisy has been doting on her and wants to babysit all the time as she loves to spend time with her, so it’s not like she’s required to because they are neglectful or anything. And of course that’s completely fine, it’s just the bringing to all our social meets and acting like she’s the mother that has no choice that’s getting a bit odd.

17,1d28m2j,AITA if I don’t let my brother see my kids without speaking to me first?," My (34M) family and I are traveling back to our home state next week. My wife and I have two girls (3 and 1), and this will be the second maybe 3rd trip home since having our first child. My brother (28M) and I aren’t currently on speaking terms. Long story short, on my first daughter’s first birthday I snapped at my mom for talking shit about my wife in front of me while opening presents. The reason was because my wife was not in the room while we were opening presents. She had her reasons, but ultimately she agreed she should have been there. 
I myself was relatively was overwhelmed by the day and everything that came along with having two sets of parents visiting simultaneously. I told her that if she was going to keep talking shit about my wife in front of me, she could leave. She was speaking about my wife, the major difference being attention was definitely on me. My brother defended my mom and I quickly reacted and told him he could leave as well. 
Sometime went by and my mom, my brother, his girlfriend, and his father all decided to leave early. My wife found out and chased them out to try to get them to stay. I then heard they were leaving, went outside and all hell broke loose. It almost came to blows between my brother and I, because he was enraged. He said a lot of things you can’t un-say and neither of us have spoken since. 
Fast forward, we are going home for my second daughters 1st birthday and he wants to see them. He didn’t call me, he told my mom and his dad and they approached me about it. They thought that his dad could take my wife and I out to dinner, and while my mom watched the girls he could come by. I said no. That if he wants to see them he needs to speak to me first. Idc about discussing the incident, what I want to make sure is that if he plans on coming into their lives that he has every intention in staying in them. For the last 2 years he hasn’t been, and I’m not interested in my girls only being payed attention to when it’s convenient for him. If he can promise me that regardless of our relationship that he will still make me effort to be in theirs I am ok with him being apart of their lives. But that this visit I still don’t feel comfortable with it, because they are young and I believe they would be to shy around him and just freak out. They do it with a lot of our guy friends who they are around all the time. Mainly though, my wife and I are uncomfortable with it and don’t want to be adding more stress on to the trip.

But by the time Friday came, I was back at school, and it was the day of the presentation. I asked the girl and Debbie if they had finished their part of the slideshow, and they laughed at my face. Why? Because they decided on changing our subject of our project and made one themselves last minute without informing me in anyway, as well as deleted all the 4 hours of research and work I had already put into the original project. Now something to note, is that I am someone with a very short temper, especially when it comes to things like this, but over the years, I have learned to control it.

I ""23M"" met a girl ""23F"" when I was younger ( when I was 18 ~ 19 years old ) 
The bond between us became unique since the first text 
At this time she was in a relation with a guy that was kinda toxic to her, and I tried to help her in that relationship, when we were talking it was like we were made for each other 

Well i will keep it simple here, a year passed I fell in love for her and she for me but, we were living at 200km from each other. 

And one night she asked me if I was Ok that she goes out with her friends for a party, I was not the type of dude to block her everything, but I had a feeling that she shouldn’t be going to that particular party and I said no but she went and after some glasses she called me saying that her ex ( the toxic one ) called her and wanted to try again their relation and she accepted, I was devasted she was honestly the girl I loved from deep down my soul and after that they got back together I remember hardly that she wanted to cut bonds with me out of respect for him 

I will be honest I cried a lot, at this moment i didn’t cried since I had 10 years old 
And I cried really a lot, I missed school and everything, all I wanted is to got her back with me, I was destroyed 

Well after almost 2 years I finally moved from this relation 
Ans 2 years later, in 2024 she texted ( she tried to talk to me during 4 years but i kept refusing to talk because I would have fell in love again and I would be destroyed again) 
After 4 years I finaly accepted and talked to her 
I was falling again in love but in 4 years I became more religious I learned to put boundries and I knew that I can’t fall in love again cuz I will want to do stuff that I dont want 
A I told her that if I talked to her it would be with the intention that I would like to mary her but i hate to say it I would have to change a lot in her life and I dont find it fair

So I said to her that out of pure love for her I cant talk to her because I am not anymore compatible with her and I dont want to change all her life for me

23,1d28ekt,AITA for yelling at my parents over allowing my sister to skip a grade when they denied me the same opportunity a few years ago?,"I (14F) have a sister who is also (14F). I have a June birthday, so I’m one of the younger ones in the grade. My sister, Eliza, has a September birthday in the same year. (We aren’t biologically sisters, I’m technically her cousin genetically.) So while I’m one of the younger ones in my grade, Eliza is one of the eldest in hers. She’s a grade lower due to the age cutoff.

 We go to a small private school with only one class per grade (about 20-30 kids). The school recently recommended that she be skipped a grade, because she’s advanced. My parents jumped at the opportunity, because they’ve been trying to convince the school to let her in my grade since forever.

I (14F) have a sister who is also (14F). I have a June birthday, so I’m one of the younger ones in the grade. My sister, Eliza, has a September birthday in the same year. (We aren’t biologically sisters, I’m technically her cousin genetically.) So while I’m one of the younger ones in my grade, Eliza is one of the eldest in hers. She’s a grade lower due to the age cutoff.

 We go to a small private school with only one class per grade (about 20-30 kids). The school recently recommended that she be skipped a grade, because she’s advanced. My parents jumped at the opportunity, because they’ve been trying to convince the school to let her in my grade since forever.

25,1d289mk,AITA for asking my mom to pay child support?,"I’m a 20 years old college student. My parents have been separated since I was 14 years old, my mom had my custody, we got child support from my dad. I’ve always had a great relationship with my mom. I’ve been living on my own so for three years and my mom would transfert me the child support every time she got it from my dad since I live on my own. Here in Canada, Quebec, even after 18 years old you still get the child support if you’re a full time student ( not sure how it works in other places )

However, I noticed I didn’t get the child support every two weeks like the court intended. I was getting third of the money about every 3-4 months. When I asked my mom about it, she said it was my dad not paying the child support to the government. I believed her, because I had no reason to not trust her and my dad had an history of not being a great person overall according to my mom.

After talking about this to my older sisters both in their 30s, they were really confused by this, because according to them my dad never missed the child support payments, my dad even helped my sisters in some difficult times. This really made me doubt what my mother said, because I know my sisters would never lie to me. 

So, after, I said to my mom that I wanted to make a change to the child support deposits so that the gouvernement deposits could go directly into my account. She then proceeds to tell me a bunch of stuff on why it isn’t a good idea. I shared what happened with one of my older sister and she confirmed those were lies ( she has some knowledge about child support). I then understood my mom was lying to me.
 
Therefore I went low contact with her while taking some legal steps to make the change concerning the deposits. Meanwhile, I went over my bank account transactions of the previous three years, there was thousands of dollars missing. Got a confirmation from the gouvernement that my dad didn’t miss any payments in those three years, my mom was stealing from me. 

Therefore, I legally took steps to make her pay child support and pay back what she stole. After this, I was wondering why my mother would do that to me and I realized she had a cannabis addiction, I’m talking smoking at least 3-4 times a day. Before, I didn’t see it as an addiction, because I didn’t know any better. Now I see it and I’m only assuming she was stealing money from me to pay for her drugs even tho I was struggling. 

Now she blames me for this situation, she says I’m being cruel, she insults, e.t.c basically every time we try to talk. Besides, while this whole thing was happening, I never wanted to cut contact with her, because I wanted to help her get over her addiction. Despite expressing this desire to stay in contact, my mom just assumed I didn’t want to talk to her anymore for some reason, even after repeating I wanted to stay in contact.

So to give some quick context:

I've been in a friend group for a little bit close to 9 years. Theres about 7 of us (6 if you dont include me)most of them about a year to a year and a half apart. 
Also to be noted that all of us live in different times zones. We have also met up in person and things went pretty smoothly! I do know that we all grew up differently and have vastly different personalities but we all still manage to get along for all these years...or so I was to believe. 

Now to the issue:

My friends like to jest and poke the bees nest and get a rise out of everyone from time to time. We all know that no one really means it from the heart or an mean place. That's what we all would say time and time again. 

Except lately this year has felt so different and it's been really tricky to navigate since it's felt that I'm either a doormat or a ticking time bomb. 

Now I'm from Texas, I know we dont have the best things going on right now. Trust me, I hate it to. But they make it seem like I'm in control of what goes on here. ""Ugh I can't believe you love there like that"" ""shows what you really want in life"" ""guess all Texans are just that stupid"" Stuff like that. 

Now if that's something said once or twice I can throw it over my shoulder and laugh it off. Thing is, it's almost a reccuring thing that they always bring up but with slightly different wording each time. 
Every time I try to poke back and the places they live they get a bit defensive.
One friend just wants everyone to get along and worries about all of us but when they're in the chat they do absolutely nothing to assist in putting out a potential fire. They try to console me with ""that's just how they are"" kind of talk. But they never used to be like that! We both know that! 

Another time I got a slut by one of them ""accidentally"". 
They were playing Ace Attorney and there was a girl that hair the same color hair as me and they literally said ""hey! It looks just like you"" and at first I laugh. Then literally seconds after I started laughing they followed with ""man she looks like a slut though!"" 
I paused and responded with ""didn't you just say that to you that looks like me?"" They tried to back peddle and say that wasnt what they ment as they were laughing. It didnt feel genuine at all. I got that same comment ""open mouth insert foot, don't let it get to you"" and I just couldn't take it. 

One of them reached out and said that I should, in their literal words ""be a bitch to them"" but if I am they get all apologetic and play the victim card.

31,1d277ch,AITA for not acting as a B&B for visiting friend?,"My friend (35M) asked if he could come visit me (34F) and stay in my apartment on my couch. I said that would be fine, stupidly, before I knew how long he was coming for. I then learned he was planning on 9 days! I had already agreed so I (again stupidly) let it be.

He arrives and it’s not too bad at first. I am feeling depleted as he is around all the time but we are making do. However, it very soon becomes apparent that he expects me to drive him around everywhere, feed him when we are at my apartment, and hang out with him at all times while we are at my apartment. 

When he first came, we went to the grocery store and picked up some groceries. I made sure to ask him what he wanted during his trip. In hindsight, I should have told him to buy himself some snacks. Instead, he kept saying “I don’t know” and vaguely suggesting a pasta dinner dish. Okay, fine. I got some stuff. When it came time to pay, because a lot of the stuff was me replenishing my pantry, I just paid for it. No biggie. 

However, sometimes when we weren’t out doing an activity and got home, I would rest in my room to get some time alone. The first day or so, I hung out with him but after a couple days, I just got so worn out. He was left to his own devices. Every time I left my room during the evenings we were home, he would make comments and/or stare at me like I am being rude for not being in the living room with him and making food with him. Clearly ordering UBEReats was not something that crossed his mind. And clearly time spent apart is bothering him.

Finally he confronts me and tells me to sit down in the living room so we can talk (thanks for the invitation to my own living room). He asks me if I am ignoring him. I get upset at this situation and say no. I tell him that I am introverted and need time to myself.

The next day, we move on. However, tomorrow and the next day, I have to work. I remind him of this and tell him that he should be prepared to also get dinner for himself. He says “don’t worry, it was pretty clear from the beginning that you weren’t going to make meals” in a passive aggressive tone. Then I get very upset. I confronted him and told him that I didn’t agree to be his bed and breakfast. 

During this trip he has paid for 3 things. One, a tank of gas. Two, he paid for a $5 ticket for me for one of the many museums. And three, he paid for a $5 parking pass for a state reservation park. I paid for the food we’ve been eating at my place (and the 2nd tank of gas). We each paid for our own everything else.

He is unwilling to take an uber places by himself. Either I am ferrying him around, or he is sat in my living room. He also is expecting me to drive him to and from the city on the days I work.

It really feels like he is expecting me to wait on and entertain him and I don’t understand when I ever agreed to that.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for not acting as a B&B for visiting friend? My friend (35M) asked if he could come visit me (34F) and stay in my apartment on my couch. I said that would be fine, stupidly, before I knew how long he was coming for. I then learned he was planning on 9 days! I had already agreed so I (again stupidly) let it be.

He arrives and it’s not too bad at first. I am feeling depleted as he is around all the time but we are making do. However, it very soon becomes apparent that he expects me to drive him around everywhere, feed him when we are at my apartment, and hang out with him at all times while we are at my apartment. 

When he first came, we went to the grocery store and picked up some groceries. I made sure to ask him what he wanted during his trip. In hindsight, I should have told him to buy himself some snacks. Instead, he kept saying “I don’t know” and vaguely suggesting a pasta dinner dish. Okay, fine. I got some stuff. When it came time to pay, because a lot of the stuff was me replenishing my pantry, I just paid for it. No biggie. 

However, sometimes when we weren’t out doing an activity and got home, I would rest in my room to get some time alone. The first day or so, I hung out with him but after a couple days, I just got so worn out. He was left to his own devices. Every time I left my room during the evenings we were home, he would make comments and/or stare at me like I am being rude for not being in the living room with him and making food with him. Clearly ordering UBEReats was not something that crossed his mind. And clearly time spent apart is bothering him.

Finally he confronts me and tells me to sit down in the living room so we can talk (thanks for the invitation to my own living room). He asks me if I am ignoring him. I get upset at this situation and say no. I tell him that I am introverted and need time to myself.

The next day, we move on. However, tomorrow and the next day, I have to work. I remind him of this and tell him that he should be prepared to also get dinner for himself. He says “don’t worry, it was pretty clear from the beginning that you weren’t going to make meals” in a passive aggressive tone. Then I get very upset. I confronted him and told him that I didn’t agree to be his bed and breakfast.

33,1d26rd4,AITA for not mentioning that my best friend/roommate and I are NOT a couple?,"First, a little bit of backstory. I'll try to be as clear as possible.

I (26) am a straight man. My best friend, ""Chase"" (24) is also a straight man. We first met when we were roommates in college, 7 years ago. We became best friends pretty quickly and we have remained close to this day. While we were in college, I had a fling with this girl who got pregnant with twin boys. She told me that she didn't want them but she also didn't want an abortion, so she was going to put them up for adoption. I convinced her to let me raise them by myself. They are now 6. Chase has helped me with them for their entire lives, by his own choice. He was there for their birth and they now call him ""Papa"" (We did not encourage this. In fact, we discouraged, but eventually gave up. They know that he is not their father and that they have a mother).

After college, Chase, the boys, and I moved to another state and found jobs at the same company. It's a tight-knit and kind of family-run (my father worked there before he died, my uncle works there, and Chase's sister works there). Because of us working together and most of our friends being either from college or from our workplace, Chase and I have never had to introduce each other to any of our friends (with new people, we obviously introduce as friend/roommate).

Here is the issue: apparently, for the past few years, our friends have thought that we are a couple. Neither Chase, nor I, had any idea of this. People at our workplace talk a lot with each other, so I guess word somehow spread that we are together (which we are not and never have been). He is my closest friend, we live together, and he is heavily involved in raising my sons, but we have never interacted in any romantic way in front of any of our friends, ever. We hug sometimes and that's it. Also, maybe important, neither of us have been in serious relationships probably ever.

We learned that everyone thought we were a couple when one of our friends (""Bob"") introduced Chase and I as ""boyfriends"" to someone. We thought that he was joking and I told him after that that kind of joke wasn't funny. Bob asked what I meant, and I told him that I didn't like him joking about Chase and I being boyfriends. Bob was genuinely confused, so I said, ""Just because two guys are good friends doesn't mean you should joke about them being a couple"". Me saying this sort of shocked the friend group and they thought I was joking at first. Chase and I both clarified that we aren't together and that we're both straight. So now, our friend group is mad at us, saying that we lied to them. Calling us AHs for pretending that we were a ""perfect couple"" (?). One friend even said that he had looked up to us as what a relationship should look like (????).

I don't think Chase and I did anything wrong. We've never said that we were a couple, but Chase is kind of on the fence and feels like we should apologize.

While I enjoy the company, I have to pay the entirety of the rent, all utilities, etc. and she never contributes anything.. like at all. She does clean occasionally which I appreciate, but she makes food for herself and really never offers to help out. 

It’s an uncomfortable conversation but am I wrong for wanting her to contribute more? Whether it’s financially, or just making food from time to time? ",4.0,0.98237914,1,0
41,1d26kbf,AITA if I want to ditch my friend with a chronic illness?,"I (46f) have a close friend (44f) that I've known for about 10 years. I am single and she is married. We met through a networking event when we both lived in the same city. We hit it off pretty quickly and it wasn't long before we were hanging out regularly. We shared a similar sense of humour, political/social passions, music tastes, and we just liked doing things around the city together. Within a couple of years we were calling ourselves besties. 

About 6 years ago she was diagnosed with MS. I've tried to provide a shoulder and a safe space for her to talk about it, but she has always preferred not to. She'll often talk about doctor's appointments, tests and treatments, but never the mental toll it must be taking. 

When we go out, she hides her symptoms and pretends everything is fine. She mostly vents about her job, friends or family issues when we get together. She'll go on for ages about her toxic parents, friends, and coworkers. It can be extremely tedious sometimes, because there's just no end to her anger and negativity, yet she keeps going back for more abuse, with a big fake smile on her face. 

2 years ago I moved to a smaller town about 1½ hrs away because I wanted to be around more green space, and be able to afford a nicer apartment. She was disappointed, and I have made an effort to visit her regularly. She doesn't drive though, and she's just not a planner, so it's always on me to make plans. 

Over the last 6-8 months, she has been slowly reducing contact. I'm always the one to reach out. When I text her, she'll take up to a week to reply. We'll schedule a video call and she just doesn't answer, replying the next day to say she was napping, without much of an apology. 

Now, we've always had an understanding between the two of us, since long before her diagnosis, that it's totally ok to bail on plans if we're just not feeling up to it. A simple text is all that's needed, and nobody gets upset or angry. I know that her disease can be debilitating at times, and I totally understand that it can be unpredictable. She knows she just needs to say the word and we can call off plans - no problem at all. So given that backgroud, the lack of communication now feels intentional.

She'll say she misses me terribly, but then she'll go for weeks without a peep, except to send random memes, which are often sappy ones about friendship. After years of listening to the way she talks about the other people in her life, I can recognize that the fakeness is now being directed at me. 

I know the mature thing to do would be to talk to her about it, but I don't think this relationship is important enough to me anymore to keep trying. If I stopped contacting her, I wonder how long it would be before I heard from her again. I don't want to be that horrible person that ditches their friend when they get sick, but I also think that if she wasn't sick, I would just accept that it has run its course, and I wouldn't think twice about walking away.

42,1d26j4i,AITA For not tagging my sister’s name to ‘Thank you’ cards for a joint party.,"My sister and I graduated college recently and our parents hosted a joint party. I went to school out of state, so it was my first time being around family and friends in a while. Growing up my sister was much more community focused and she was always known as the kinder and more present sister. 

It was a great party and my parents’ friends were very generous. After a few days at home, I went back to my new home. On a weekly FaceTime call, my family happened to catch me while I was writing thank you cards. I had gone to a local stationary store and bought cards to mail thank you letters. On the call my sister asked if I was attaching her name to the letters, to which I told her I had not. I wasn’t doing this to be malicious, she talked about thank you letters when I brought it up when were together. I thought she would mail letters of her own, but apparently she threw the checks out after she deposited them, so she did not have the addresses to mail letters. 

Since our parents’ friends were generous and both gave us our own checks, I feel as though it would only be right for her to write her own letters. My parents sided with her saying it was selfish to leave out my sister, given it was a joint party and it would take no extra effort to add her name at the bottom. My parents are even suggesting I reopen the sealed letters and add her name before I mail. 

EDIT: and since I’m out of state she was heavily involved in the planning and coordination of this party. She feels as though the least I could have done was to add her name to the thank you letters.

44,1d26cx6,AITA for slut-shaming a friend?,"Disclaimer: I take full accountability for my actions. I don't think it was ok, but I also don't think what I did warranted everyone's actions. Also this is a pretty lengthy post. I would appreciate it if this doesn't end up on TikTok! I will be taking down this post if it ends up circulating too much. 

For starters, we'll call this person Mai (F). She had a pretty bad reputation, especially losing all her girlfriends and seemingly keeping all her guy friends. She became part of our friend group since she joined the sorority I was in and I invited her to one of the parties where she ended up patching things up with one of the people in our friend group. At first, I was hesitant to become friends with her due to her reputation but I gave it a chance because I'm not one to judge a person based on what others say.

Things already started off rocky with some of the guys instigating that we wouldn't be good friends. One of my gal friends didn't like Mai for seemingly flirting with the guy she liked. It was a pretty messy situation considering the guy wasn't exactly single either.

Regardless, I become good friends with Mai but I still constantly heard outside noise from others, more specifically the other girls in the group. A LOT of the people in the group called her an attention-seeker and other things that I don't want to say. It got worse when a lot of people thought her and a friend in the group, Rory (M), were dating. A lot of buzz about this went around in the group and I confronted Rory about it because it wasn't a good look. He didn't like that I butted in their business and I ultimately only did it because people in the group kept asking me about it which I didn't like either.

Fast forward, Mai and Rory and I stop being friends. The other girls in the group said that it's fine and they didn't like her anyways. This a pretty important detail to note is that it didn't help that a lot of the guys would often make jokes of pitting us against each other. The guys always seemed to have done that even before Mai entered the group. I tried my best not to take it too seriously, but it got to me at times when the girls aren't backing up the girls, and this was what I was constantly surrounded with. To give you an idea of how bad their instigations are, one of the couples in the group almost broke up because everyone kept joking around that she was probably hooking up with one of the guys in the group every time they would hang out 1 on 1.

Eventually with Mai still being in the group, we end up patching things up and clearing the air. Apparently, I had told people that she was playing Rory and that they shouldn't be together which wasn't what I said at all. People asked of my opinion and my words got twisted -- I said that Rory could get hurt because Mai wasn't looking for a serious relationship and he was catching feelings. Anyways, we end up being friends but it wasn't the same anymore.

I began seeing someone, Sam (M), and I would bring him as my plus one to parties. We met through one of those co-rush events and he was in the frat that hosted it. We first started off casually seeing each other but we had a complicated relationship since he wanted a serious one and I didn't. We were constantly on and off, mostly reaching out to one another when we wanted attention. I brought him to a friend's party where him and Mai interacted quite a bit. I didn't really care but what kind of ticked me off was when Mai splashed him with bubbles and soapy water (it was a summer party). They got close I guess but it was whatever during this time in my life. I told him that they seem to get along and that maybe they would end up dating (considering he wants a serious relationship). He said no and I quote ""I know girls like her, it's just all attention"". He continued on saying that he wanted to be with me but I wasn't ready yet.

A few months pass by, I end up telling Sam that I wanted to be in a relationship and I didn't want to play around anymore which was kind of true. We kind of start talking again and we end up hooking up for the first time. I of course gave him the ""what does this mean for us?"" question to which he said that he was still thinking about it. Liz (F), one of the girls who seems to absolutely not like Mai, started to not like me as well. I became some what good friends with her boyfriend since we had the same hobby of playing Volleyball and we would both go to the park to play with some of our other friends. I guess me being single made her felt threatened which I always found weird because not once did I show interest in her boyfriend.

Anyways, Sam ends up telling me that he's not interested in me anymore and that he felt like I ""played"" him. He explains that he caught feelings for me and that I just led him on. This is the part that confuses me because 1) we had only known each other for maybe a month when I first brought him to a party 2) we didn't consistently meet up AT ALL. I only mostly saw him at parties 3) he was talking to other girls besides me.

Despite everything, I apologized anyways since that wasn't my intention. I thought I made it clear that I didn't want a relationship but I guess not.

Here's where everything goes down -- all of us in the group go to a frat party. Everyone is there and I end up getting pretty messed up because mentally, I wasn't doing the best at the time. I pass out, wake up, and find Mai and Sam cuddling together on the couch. His arms are around her for most of the night and he lends her his letterman jacket, the same one I've worn before. I asked why he would do this and he said he only wants to be friends. In that moment, I asked him not to do this especially when he knew everything I've been through. I felt extremely upset.

A couple days later Liz and another friend, Ana (F), seem to be concerned and brought up to me how they didn't like seeing Mai get cozy with Sam. Ana especially says how she hates when Mai gets drunk because she gets really touchy with the guys. Liz just straight up slut shames Mai. Two other guys also end up telling me how they don't think what Sam and Mai did was cool.

Everyone was just feeding me fire, and not a single person was giving me any reassuring thought to it.

I end up blowing up on Sam first because he told me that he was going to hang out with Mai. It's also good to note that he apparently has a girlfriend already at this time. This party happened about 2 weeks after we officially broke things off by the way. I told him why Mai out of all people? And that he says they're just friends. I blew up and said she wasn't my friend and that none of the girls liked her either.

Mai ends up hearing about everything I said before I could confront her too. The people who I thought would back me up, all ended up dropping me. The entire group stopped talking to me. None of the girls talk to me anymore, even though they instigated most of the hate towards her. It's funny still seeing how they still hang out with her.

I felt bad for saying those things about Mai and will always regret blowing up like that, but was it right for everyone else to stop being friends with me? Not a single person has explained what I did wrong to them personally and I understand that I did her wrong, but everyone seems to be forgiving towards anyone else. I've been trying to move past this situation since I've made so many new friends who I consider my long-term friendships. It just really sucks because if I wasn't in that friend group to begin with, I think Mai and I could've been good friends.

45,1d2yga1,AITA for getting mad that my housemate’s boyfriend is staying over again?,"My (F26) housemate (M21) had a friend (M24) stay over back in February. M24 ended up staying for 2.5 months, not paying any rent or bills or anything towards the house. 

M24 has ended up dating my other housemate (F22). While M24 was staying, my housemates were paying for everything for him because he’s jobless and moneyless, but not homeless. This bothered me a lot because I mostly saw my friends getting used. 

Throughout this time period, I was not home a lot because I had some engagements and holidays and things going on. But I genuinely think I was mostly away because there was a stranger in my house and I’d rather be anywhere but. 

I had asked housemate M21 near enough every week when M24 would be leaving, and I always got excuses as to why he couldn’t go. Until I snapped and said he needs to go now, I’m not asking anymore. So he left a few days after.

Less than 3 weeks later, housemate F22 asks if I’d be bothered if he comes to stay for a few days. I said, “I would’ve preferred if I had more time in the house without guests, but if you need that then that’s fine”. She also assured me he’d have travel back booked so he definitely was going. (She has complicated mental health issues, so I was allowing her some grace). He leaves 3 days later, as promised. 

She then went to visit him last Monday, returning Thursday. With him. Again. And I lost it. 

I asked why he was back at the house again. She said she shouldn’t have to ask to have her partner stay. I said it was different because he was here for so long and he’s been back twice within a month since leaving. She said I was rude for bringing it up in front of him, which I agree with. But at this point I don’t really care. I feel like he never left. I also feel like I’m well within my rights to ask for a break from him being in the house.

I also have complicated mental health issues from childhood and more recent trauma. Having a stranger in my space makes me feel unable to relax and feel comfortable. She knows this as I’ve expressed it.

The relationship with my mom was not easy, but that necklace reminds me of happy times with her. We had talked many times about me having it, and she had even spoken to a jeweller about getting a copy of the necklace made many years ago because I loved it so much.

Before my mum passed, a friend of hers visited to say her last goodbyes. My mum invited her to choose some items to take home, and she picked the necklace along with other things. The problem is that the necklace had been promised to me before. I understand this was forgotten and it is understandable given her ill health.  I didn't speak up then because I wanted to honor my mum's wishes and it didn't feel right to make a fuss over a necklace.

I've stayed in touch with my mum's friend and asked if she would be willing to leave the necklace to me if she ever passed. I explained the situation, apologized, and she said that the other things my mum had given her were more valuable, and she'd happily send me the necklace. I felt guilty about asking, so I didn't follow up, but I recently told her that I would like to take her up on the offer. She has read my message but hasn't responded. It's been several weeks now, and I'm worried that I may have upset her.

I'm torn about this situation. On the one hand, I feel like I shouldn't be so concerned about a material possession, but on the other hand, the necklace holds a lot of sentimental value for me.

So am I the asshole for asking for this necklace?

I believe the answer is probably yes, but I would like to hear other people's thoughts. I'm unsure whether to message my mum's friend again or just leave it. I find myself thinking about the necklace a lot. 

Ultimately, I know this is just grief, and I miss my mum a lot.

49,1d2yap7,AITA For having a panic attack in the computer lab?,"Hello all. I’m a 21 year old currently in my junior year of college. This event happened a couple weeks ago, but I still think about it sometimes and it irks me, so I want to clear my conscience.

A couple weeks ago was midterms. I was really stressed out because I had ALOT of work to do. On top of that I had had 3 deaths in the family in a span of months. Needless to say, I was extremely stressed. I also suffer from multiple anxiety disorders so I struggle greatly with managing my stress, but I still manage to keep it to myself so as not to stress others. I also have ADHD, which definitely makes my academics harder, which adds to this stress.

Well, with all this pent up stress, I finally broke. I was in the computer lab in my dorm common area. It’s a small room with 7- 6 computers, so not very big. I was working on my midterm assignments there while my bf was sitting next to me. Well unfortunately, the pent up stress made me have a panic attack. It was really bad and the hyperventilating was loud, but I attempted to calm myself down by taking deep breaths and saying words (something that helps me calm down is saying certain words repeatedly, idk why.)

Well, there was a girl at the computer behind me. I noticed she kept loudly heavy sighing but I was obviously too preoccupied to pay too much attention since I was trying my best to quickly calm down so I wouldn’t be loud. I desperately wanted to just leave the room and go somewhere that was more private, but I was very dizzy and my legs were shaky, so I was worried I’d fall over.

While I was attempting to calm myself down, eventually this girl had enough. She bolted up and slammed her chair against the table. She started yelling at me which ultimately made my panicking worse. She told me that nothing was worth stressing out this much and being so loud and that I was a spoiled and melodramatic baby to even be acting like this. I couldn’t believe this, she doesn’t even know me. Some more really hurtful things were said, but I really don’t wanna revisit that because it makes me feel awful. She continued to yell at me and make loud noises while I was attempting to calm down, but to no avail because the screaming wasn’t helping and was only making my panic attack worse. Finally after about 10 minutes, she stormed out of the room, leaving me in tears. 

I felt awful and still do. I feel so awful to know I was disturbing someone and distracting someone. But I feel even worse because I was being a loud and annoying distraction when I try my absolute hardest not to have these panic attacks in public, but I failed and ultimately made other people pay the price. Idk I haven’t told a soul about his because it’s extremely embarrassing, but I need to get it off my chest. I just really need to know, what do you guys think?

50,1d2y199,AITA for saying that it’s rude to speak in another language when people who do not speak that language are present?,"Half of my (33F) family speaks French. There are a number of people however who only speak English. All of the French speakers also speak English. I recently got into a debate with another family member, “James” (30M) because frequently some family members will switch to French when there are English only speakers in the room. I called them out for it, as I think it’s extremely rude to speak a language that some people in the room do not speak when everyone shares a common language. James disagreed and said sometimes people might want to have a private conversation and they should be able to do that in their second language. I said if they needed to have a private conversation, they should be stepping into another room or waiting until the non French speaker is not in the room. Occasionally, the French speakers will be having a conversation in English with an English only speaker and then suddenly switch to French and give a half assed translation at the end (leaving the English speaker with a limited way to add to the conversation). There was a long back and forth between James and I with him insisting it isn’t rude to exclude someone from the conversation if it’s in another language. It got a bit heated and ended with James saying that it’s entitled of the English speakers to think that everyone should “accommodate them” and that I was an AH for insinuating that he lacks manners.

52,1d2xrsc,AITA for not paying $600 monthly to a house I helped buy my mom buy?,"A little background my mother rents a small house which she has filled because of her hoarding. She doesn't work, but she does have money in other places that I don't know about. On the other hand I do work and rent a house right now. The money I had saved up was being invested which was getting me some decent ROl. We have been wanting to buy a house for a while but didn't have enough funds by ourselves. But together we would have the amount of money needed to buy a house with cash, so I sold my investments and started house hunting with her.

Originally the plan would have been to live together until I saved up enough to buy a house, 1-2 years. In that time she would pay me back my money and the house would be hers, if she couldn’t then we would share ownership of the house, and continue living together. I would pay house taxes, handymen work will be on me as well and major fixes are on her, no rent for either of us.

After house hunting for a few weeks we finally found a house that we both liked and decided to put in an offer which did get accepted. I would be paying about 46% of the house and she would pay the remaining 54% of the house.

But my mom decided that it would be better if I lived in the house for 1-2 years, pay her rent $600, half of the taxes, major fixes are on her and she gets one room in the house to do what she wants with in the meantime. I didn’t think that was fair so my rebuttal was that if she wants a room then I’m not paying $600 rent and I’m not paying taxes in either of those situations. At the end of the day your getting a whole house and I’m paying you rent even if it’s half of the rent rate in my area. She said if she doesn’t get a room in the house then I would have to pay her the going rate for rent in my area. That’s about where the conversation ended.

My initial thoughts are that she wants the room in the house because she wants some sort of control over the house while not committing to being there.

issue happened earlier today. we were out for most of the morning and i was absolutely fine for all that outside of getting kinda warm, as we all did, because it's new york in late may. we wandered for a bit, went to see ground zero and then came back to the hotel, with the original plan being that we would all go on the ferry ride around the city together. i started feeling nauseous whilst we were back at the hotel, like i was minutes away from throwing up. i went to the bathroom and tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away quickly before we left, but as the title suggests this did not happen. i told my parents i felt ill so we tried sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for it to clear up. it did not and my parents agreed to let me stay back by myself at the hotel whilst they and my sister went on the ferry. i have been told to text my dad every hour to let him know i'm okay, which i'm doing. however when i left them they seemed very annoyed and whilst we were leaving the room my mum told me i needed to learn to stick stuff out sometimes, such as feeling ill or walking long distances/standing for a while (i tend to sit down more than your average person during those things as i tire out quicker i guess). i feel insanely guilty for causing something like this on a trip that's for my mother and i'm already going to apologise when they get back and hopefully talk to them about it.

issue happened earlier today. we were out for most of the morning and i was absolutely fine for all that outside of getting kinda warm, as we all did, because it's new york in late may. we wandered for a bit, went to see ground zero and then came back to the hotel, with the original plan being that we would all go on the ferry ride around the city together. i started feeling nauseous whilst we were back at the hotel, like i was minutes away from throwing up. i went to the bathroom and tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away quickly before we left, but as the title suggests this did not happen. i told my parents i felt ill so we tried sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for it to clear up. it did not and my parents agreed to let me stay back by myself at the hotel whilst they and my sister went on the ferry. i have been told to text my dad every hour to let him know i'm okay, which i'm doing. however when i left them they seemed very annoyed and whilst we were leaving the room my mum told me i needed to learn to stick stuff out sometimes, such as feeling ill or walking long distances/standing for a while (i tend to sit down more than your average person during those things as i tire out quicker i guess). i feel insanely guilty for causing something like this on a trip that's for my mother and i'm already going to apologise when they get back and hopefully talk to them about it.

i am aware that getting a place within 30 days will logistically be difficult for him. he has no car, no job, no credit, only 19, just has this check money. i feel bad, but i do not want him in my house anymore, so i am putting my foot down.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for kicking out my roommate? life will get very difficult for him after this, and our friendship will be destroyed, but this needs to happen I \[20M\] live with my best friend \[20M\], and his ex-boyfriend \[19M\]. we share rent in my childhood home together. i gave his ex-boyfriend a 30-day notice to leave the house today.

55,1d2x49n,AITA For Calling My Friends Out For Ditching Me On A 7 Hour Road Trip?,"Hi Everyone,

First time poster, this is kind of a complex situation. So I have two ""friends"", we will call them Jack and Sally. Jack and I have known each other for years and have been good friends up until now, Sally and I are acquaintances. We all play and coach volleyball in Wisconsin, and we were supposed to road trip to Columbus on Sunday together to play on our respective coaches' teams in the Men's and Women's Volleyball Adult National Tournament starting Monday morning.

All of us played in another, different, tournament the night prior to leaving (Saturday) and discussed the plan for us then that Jack would pick me up at 6am from my house Sunday even though we don't play until Monday at 9am, because Jack and Sally want to party the night prior to us playing with some other players. Tournament finishes up, I go home to work, pack, and prep the house and pets for a long week away. Don't sleep well.

Sally responds to me at 5:43am that she's up, I respond at 5:45am that I'm all packed and ready to go and that she should meet me at place, since Jack will be picking me up there and it would save a trip. I know where Sally lives, it's about a half hour, so I tell her I'm going to set an alarm for 30 minutes from now and get more sleep.

I wake up at 8am. I slept through the alarm I set (damn), and my phone was accidentally on vibrate. Jack and Sally never showed up. I open up my messages from Sally and she said she was going to park somewhere different and Jack and I would pick her up around 6:10. Jack called at 6:45 a few times. Sally then formed a group chat with us and messaged at 7am this was ""not cool and not funny"" and that I ""need to wake up and tell Jack I'm ready to go"", they then agreed on a completely different address and said whoever's not there is getting left in Wisconsin, all while I was asleep.

Mind you, Jack was supposed to meet at my house. Jack then says in this group chat ""Oh hey, look at that we made a plan and showed up somewhere on time nice"", and left without me. I call Jack, Jack told me he never showed up when I didn't answer his call, even though Sally sent him the messages saying I was ready, she should meet me, and I was going to lay back down. Jack tells me ""maybe it's not worth it to go down man, it's just a tournament"", I say no and book a Greyhound to Columbus.

From here, I hit the Greyhound to Chicago and the connecting bus for Columbus leaves without me in a mess of errors on both me and staff. I'm not giving up yet, so I book a flight out of O'Hare same day, and that gets cancelled at midnight, never made it to Columbus, missed nationals.

Meanwhile, on the drive for Jack and Sally, Jack has the gall to text me, ""If we die in this storm, it's all your fault because you made us late"". I snap at him and tell him it takes two ounces of energy to ring a doorbell, and to fuck off, it also takes two brain cells to pull over in a storm. I'm ready to cut Jack & Sally off.

I wear my normal every day clothes to work and nobody has any issue with it because nobody ever sees me. 

Recently my mom (55 F) decided to spend over $100 to get me work clothes, clothes I didn’t need with money we don’t have right now. My dad recently past away in April and I am currently the only one with a job. When I went to look at the clothes after she handed them to me I immediately noticed that these clothes were all size 5-6 XL. I wear a L-2XL depending on brand.

Once I saw that the clothes were comically oversized and looked like they were made for someone about 40 years older than me, I told her I didn’t want them and that she should return them to get that money back since we could really use it for bills. She got upset with me and kept saying “I am so sorry I offended you” and a part of me felt bad but at the same time it made me feel horrible about how she perceives me.

57,1d2wxwr,AITA Im not travelling to see my boyfriend anymore,"Im 26f and my bf is 28m, we’ve been in a relationship for 1 year. Im always making an effort to travel to his house roughly 30minutes away weather I finish work at 10pm or 10am I work doing sleepovers at my job also so can work 3days in a row doing 2 sleeps a week sometimes then finishing at 10pm on my last shift day 3. I make the effort because I want to see him but it seems to go unnoticed when I’m with him he sits on his computer for hours and then might sit with me for 30mins to an hour to watch something later on. He’s autistic so also isn’t very emotionally expressive and likes his space when with me all of which I have come to terms with and don’t mind but I feel unwanted. My problem is that he never drives to see me or to my house, if I ask I get the response “dunno” “maybe” “not sure” or “no I don’t want to”. Usually with the reasoning that my room is small or that he doesn’t like how loud my family can be as it seems like they are always shouting.  Iv just begun to feel like the relationship is completely one sided. I’m the only one that says “I love you” first im the only one to instigate a hug or any form of affection and I’m the only one to drive so we can see eachother. He hasn’t been to my house since march and that was for 1 night as we went away on holiday as my house is closer to the airport. I’m worried that im TA for feeling fed up with the situation and like he’s not arsed about me. I left his house and messaged him saying ‘when he wants to see me he knows where I am’ because I’m sick of feeling like their is zero effort and like he’s not arsed about seeing me or being with me. He has made me feel unreasonable for feeling low and upset about all this and their is such a lack of affection and I’m trying to bring it up to communicate but it always ends in an argument that’s my fault or I’m told to “shut up” because he doesn’t want to talk about it or hear about it.

58,1d2wwbm,AITA for not giving my ex enough warning about child’s needed medication refill?,"My ex and I share 50/50 physical and legal custody and we split medical bills 50/50.  I used to pay the bills in full and he would reimburse me upon a copy of the receipt.  A few years ago, he requested to pay the providers directly to avoid owing me money (he owed me quite a lot of money a few years ago and is now caught up).  This works great for us except for pharmacy stuff.  

We used to have whomever had physical custody of the child when a refill was needed would just go pick up and pay for the med and the other would reimburse half of it.  Now we have to keep up with who paid for which med and when so there is a lot more communication throughout the month (child has many prescriptions).  His solution was to put the child on his pharmacy account and now he can pay when it is his turn via the app and I can just go pick it up the child runs out at my house.  The only issue was he still expected me to physically deliver the meds to him when it was my turn to pay since I couldn’t pay via the app since they were on his plan.  When I brought up this problem (that I always had to pick up the meds) he was unwilling to budge on his expectations.  

There was an app update recently and now I can have the child on my own account and pay via the app and not remove his ability to pay via the app.  I thought this was resolved (whoever’s turn it is to pay can do so via the app and whomever has physical custody can pick up the refill), but now he has a new problem.  He is upset if, when the child returns to my house, I contact him that night or next morning saying that he will need to pay for a refill within the next week.  Now, to be clear, I always make sure she isn’t totally out (or down to two or three pills) before they comes back.  So this is say a notification on Monday morning that I need him to pay for a refill by Thursday night.  He insists that I need to check for the entire week I’ll have the child before I send them to him (so plan for two weeks in the future).  I think, since he only needs to log into the app and pay, that 3-4 days is plenty of time.  

He says it’s not about the money or time.  It’s about me being inconsiderate to him.  I’ve offered in these scenarios to just pay for it myself and he can pay me back later or just pay for it the next two times, but he doesn’t want that either. This is a lot of medication to sort out day and night doses and half pills and stuff so I’m not really wanting to get another pill organizer and do this just because he is telling me to.  These are monthly meds so I think he could plan ahead himself if he is that concerned.  There is a history of emotional abuse/control from him and I’d really just like to not talk to him any more than is necessary if I can help it.   I had to do years of therapy after our divorce to learn to set boundaries with him.  So this seems like he’s just looking for a reason to cause drama. AITA here?

59,1d2ww3o,AITA for leaving a groupchat? ,"Recently I discovered that my bf is in a group chat with his cousins, friends, and ex. My bf claims he’s over his ex and wants nothing to do with her. He told me that he has had multiple chances to get back with her, but he wants to be with me. To me this did not sound romantic because her husband died last year, so I thought his comment was inappropriate. What gets to me is that 2 weeks before he asked me out he told me he was going to ask me out but this group chat hung out together and he had mix feelings. I guess seeing his ex and interacting with her made him relive his moments with her. I know she is his first love because not talking to her for 10 years, but seeing her once made him catch feelings again. I asked him how long did it take to get over his feelings for her after seeing her for the first time in 10 years, and he said it took a week. So that means he asked me out a week after his feelings for her went away. I don’t know if I am nitpicking everything but I basically removed him from the group chat, he said it did not matter to him if I did it. But I know they have another group chat as well. Also I saw in the text messages that they hung out as a group on December, so after we started dating.

PS: 1)We are not from the same state so he hung out with them during our college breaks.
 2)At the time he told me had mix feelings about asking me out, I did not know it was due to his ex until after we started dating.
3) I am 20f and he is 26m , so they dated when they were 16-18, but he said their relationship was toxic  (on and off). I know he cheated on her but supposedly he states that she cheated as well.

ANYWAYS, one day i jokingly mentioned to my friend Beer that we should make him a get well card. she responded with “yeah omg” and i said wait seriously? just to verify she was for real cause i actually did wanna make one. she said yeah and i started goin crazy about how we can make it all cute and stuff. 

I went over to her house and we made the card, it was all coquette with pink glitter and ribbon and pink marker and all the fun stuff. after finishing and signing our messages and names, she was like “let me scribble my name out” and i was just like wtf no we just made this together. and she was like “no i don’t wanna e a part of this” and internally i lost my sht because she was jumping ship so late, but i just laughed it off. she continued to mention this and i continued to laugh it off as it would always be said in a joking manner (this could make me TA) and eventually i told her off saying that why would she pull this BS cause i have been holding the card for so long waiting for him to get back (he came for the first time  today but i ddint see him cause he had to make up his finals) and i told her how if she SERIOUSLY was uncomfortable that i didn’t get why she agreed with me initially. she claimed she was “confused” and didn’t get we were making him a card and this confused ME cause i v made it very clear on multiple occasions saying things like “i’m excited to make Mushrooms card” and whatnot. she also claims that i can present it to him on my own and fully discredit her which will absolutely spark a reaction from his friends and it’ll be kinda embarrassing imo. she said it’ll make her look bad and i might as well do it myself and take all his friends BS.

To sum it up, during my childhood up to the day I moved out at 18 and in with my dad, she has always had a problem with alcohol. She was the type that left home to buy groceries or maybe do the laundry and then come back home 5-7 hours later, by the time it had gotten dark outside with the excuse that she met her friends and had to talk with them. Every time it was the same excuse and every time she came back she was drunk.

Because of this but also other stuff I don’t want to be in contact with here at all. The other stuff include the times she took money I had saved and lied about it, or told me I was sensitive to feel the need to know where she was when she was gone for more than 3 hours. During the time I was too young to be home alone she also dragged me along to the bars. When I cried that I wanted to go home she blames to others that I was tired and gave me money to go and buy candy to distract me. Moreover the rest of my childhood I had to be the parent for her.

Today she and I only have contact through text and sometimes meet up (never alone and always with my aunt) to receive presents and other things she wants me to have. She’s trying to act nicer and more motherly by texting me advice and sometimes getting me things she thinks I need like recipe books or emergency packets. My aunt though she also has been hurt by my mom through words and behavior she still thinks that mom has actually changed for the better.

In my family women are very stubborn, my mom and my grandma always have to be right and love to say 'i told you so', if they are wrong they'll get very angry and stop speaking to everyone for a couple of hours or days depending on how wrong they were, according to my husband, I'm stubborn but not to that level, I know when to stop.
   
I gave birth to my daughter almost four months ago, and my grandma came to help me during the first 40 days, and we had A LOT of troubles with each other, because she said that my baby was ALWAYS hungry (she is breastfed, and I have a lot of milk thank God) even if she just finished eating, for my grandma if she cried it was hunger, it got to a point where I cried because she wouldn't stop, and my breasts were sore.
   
When that happened my mom talked to her and made her stop, things got better, but a couple of weeks ago my daughter found her hands and loves to suck the side of her hand, ever since that day my mother insists she is hungry, even if she just fed, it's like it's all starting again.
  
Last week, we began teaching her to sleep on her own, which means not on me, but beside me, it been a process but we're getting to the point where she understands that she has to sleep, she now cries for a couple of minutes, 5 tops, and sleeps on her own sucking her hand.
   
Today my mother was visiting and when it was my baby's time to nap, I did the routine, and when she was falling asleep my mother woke her and handed her to me saying she was hungry, because she was sucking her hand, which led to a massive screaming session (because no one wants to be woken up suddenly).
  
So I snapped at her telling her to stop saying that, she just ate, and now she'll have trouble falling asleep again (which happened, the only way I could calm her was letting her fall asleep in my arms).
  
Now my mom is angry with me, but I'm really angry with her as well, because this is not the only time she is disrespecting the way I try to teach my baby. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for snapping at my mother? This is going to be long

63,1d2wdi9,WIBTA if I tell my roommate/best friend just how disgusting I find them.,"For some backstory we’ve been friends for almost 3yrs and have been living together for about 7 months. He’s an amazing and super friend but can be inconsiderate and just nasty at times. I’m constantly having to clean up after him and it’s becoming very mentally draining. He never puts his dishes in the sink, he showers and leaves bits of hair and dirt(?) behind in the tub, almost never cleans the apartment without being asked to in advance. He constantly smells like B.O and garlic which I can sometimes smell around the apartment after he’s left, his room always stinks because he doesn’t clean it and leaves his window shut and you have to basically force a healthy meal down his throat because all he does is drink energy drinks, coffee and eats junk and snacks. And just so you know, I’ve had multiple conversations with him about these things. 

When I went to go use the bathroom I saw his half flushed poop floating around in the toilet bowl. This is not the first time, it happens a couple times a month. I yelled at him to go take care of it and that it was a disgusting thing to have to walk in to. He didn’t say anything and flushed it. 

I tend to keep my toothbrush in my room because he poops like 3x a day and the idea of the germs spreading onto my toothbrush disgust me, but I had forgotten the day prior to put it back. So when I decided I’d go take a shower and brush my teeth I saw that my toothbrush was wet and used. Mind you he has a bad habit of not rinsing off his toothbrush after use so his always builds up with spit/toothpaste and gets all grimy and nasty. I yelled at him for the second time today just pissed off because wtf. I was disgusted! He deflected and blamed me for leaving it in the bathroom to begin with and huffed and puffed that he’d just get me a new one and left. 

I’m at a loss, I can’t afford to move and neither can him. I’m so pissed off I have half the mind to just yell at him about all the nasty and annoying things he does but I know that it’ll upset him. But at the same time I’m the one that’s constantly dealing with all this stuff and my mind keeps telling me that he should deal with the burden of my frustration the same way I deal with the burden of his inconsiderations.

Genes are weird, what are you gonna do?

Both my kids and myself have my husband’s last name, which is a popular Dominican last name. There have been times we get looks when people hear our last name and my husband isn’t around. But it’s never been too bad and usually, I shrug it off.

Due to my husband’s work schedule, he’s rarely at school events. So, most people just know me. There’s another little girl in my daughter’s class with the same last name as us. Her mom also volunteers often. When we met, she flat out said “you’re not Dominican.” I said, “no. My husband and kids are.” She said “but your last name is (x)”.

I said I never claimed to be. She said my kids aren’t either and that my husband is probably only a little Dominican and we’re claiming a culture that’s not ours.

I was dumbfounded. All I could ask was “are you stupid?” She said there was no need to be defensive. Finally, I had enough, pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of myself with my husband and the kids. She stared at it for a moment and mumbled an apology.

I don’t blame him for this; we all have our moments, but in the moment I was quite upset so I confided in this girl who I thought I was very close with. *SPECIFICALLY, I DID SAY TO HER THAT ME AND MY BOYFRIEND HAVE BEEN IN A ROUGH SPOT RECENTLY, AND WE DISCUSSED POTENTIAL BREAKUP (VERY LIGHTHEARTEDLY)*.In the moment, she offered me a lot of support, and even referenced the troubles of her own relationship in comforting me. I felt like it brought us closer.

A few months later, when I was abroad, my boyfriend texted me very upset about me allegedly saying that I ‘wanted to break up with him’ and that I was actively upset in the relationship. I was very confused, until I realised that he had been speaking to this girl. She had gotten drunk, and told him this comPLETELY out of context, as well as using phrases which I just did not say. Not only had she complained about her own relationship to me, making this hypocritical, I just didn’t see why she would do it. 

I called her to ask, and she decided to play the moral card and claim that my boyfriend just ‘had to know’ - there were no severe issues at hand between me and my boyfriend. So, I theorised (and still believe to this day) that she was simply intoxicated, and seeking attention from men. She also reported this information to a wider group of people as she told him at a party - making me look like a terrible girlfriend.

She has never apologised, and still sticks to her defence of her moral duty. I think this is pathetic - she used my personal business as a conversation starter, and not only seriously upset my boyfriend but made and continues to make me look like a shitty person. If she really was concerned, couldn’t she have come to me first? I told her off over the phone, and people have criticised me for it. Am I the asshole for being super pissed off about this?

68,1d2vsqq,AITA for how I responded to my husband?,"My husband (29m) & I (29f) got into an argument this morning over the dishwasher... I WFH as a product manager for a software company. 50% of my time is dedicated to product demos after we announced a huge partnership. My husband is unemployed but is in school & he graduates next quarter.

Today he brought me Chipotle for lunch & I was eating it at my desk. He sat with me in my office for awhile & we made an inquiry call to a property management company to take over our out of state rental when our current tenant moves out.

When I was done eating, I handed him my plate and we went about our separate business for the day. I was preparing for Friday's demo. About 10 mins later, I hear him holler from the kitchen but didn't hear what he said, so I replied ""What?"" he responds ""Is the dishwasher clean?"" I said ""I don't know what's the light say? (there's a blue indicator light when they're clean) and he said there was no light... So, I walk out to the kitchen and he's extremely frustrated. This totally caught me off guard.

He told me I had no reason to be upset because he was just asking me about the dishwasher and a simple yes or no would have been fine. I said I didn't know, that's why I came out here to take a look and I wasn't upset?! He’s acknowledged I came out with no attitude or hostility but said the damage was already done, he was angered by my initial tone. I tried to explain that maybe it came across that way b/c we're several rooms apart yelling back and forth and I was preparing for a demo Friday, so maybe I had a hard time mentally switching gears while focused. Ultimately, I still said I'm sorry I never want to make him feel bad & I'll work on my tone. I understand we may not always be aware of how our tone is perceived by others. 

I suggested a solution for future communication that instead of assuming I'm upset, he asks me if everything's OK, or if I'm busy. He shut that down and told me the best solution is me having a good tone with him all the time despite whatever I have going on. I said that's not really realistic... communication would go a long way here.

He then starts going on about how he was just in my office and I wasn't even doing anything. I again explained I was on lunch & after handed him my plate, I went back to work. This isn't the first time he's made comments like this about my work and I've asked him to stop. He has no idea what I do all day. Just because I'm home when you're home doesn't mean I'm available.

Am I the AH for canceling the BF plans I made for his 30th after changing them 3 seperate time to accomidate his changes of mind?

I planned a whole weekend away as his birthday falls on a saturday for the BF to drive a steam train & tram and spa day all things he had mentioned on his before 30 bucket list but didn't do.

I told him I made plans but not what so they would be a surprise on the days.

He then told me his family were comong to town so he 'couldn't' see me on his birthday which is a saturday.

I said fine then canceld the weekend.

Then I booked him tickets for a very expensive concert also on the bucket list that cost more than all the original plan combined.

He then wont give me a straight answer to what day I can see him.

I snaped when he was being cagy about giving me a day and time to meet a few weekends back and it ecilated into multiple examples where I said ""you can't even give me a day to see you for your birthday.""

We had a discusion and I said how much effort I put into the original birthday plan and its imposible to plan anything as he wont commit to a day or time ever for anything - everytime we are at mine its always a 20 min back and forth ""what do you want to eat?"" He can't seem to make any decisions and I keep telling gim it is infuriating. 

Then he suddenly wants to see me on his birthday and bumps his family to Sunday.

I can't rebook the original things because they get booked up months in advance. He still dosen't know what it was.

So I picked a VR thing & hotel for Friday night and a broadway show for Saturday all things he wants to do. We are staying in our own city so he can have all Sunday for the family wothout having to rush anywhere.

Then today he sends me texts that he wants to take days off work wed-monday and go somewhere.

I say fine, then give him some options based on the places he wanted to go.


Then it turns out they are only half days which is pointless to go somewhere because on his half days he wont finish until 2 then on Sunday he would still need to be back to see his family...

I told him he can pick what he wants to do and can plan the things and tell me where to meet him because I have planed and canceled so many things at this point I am not doing it again.

I canceled what I planed except for the concert tickets that wont be for months and will still give as a present.

70,1d2vpc3,WIBTA for not allowing my FIL to see my children,"My Father-in-law (FIL) is TOXIC; he walks over boundaries my husband and myself have set for our children, disrespects my daughter (his granddaughter) - to the point where I question if he wants her to exist. When I was preggo with my son (oldest child) FIL was over the moon excited about the baby, two years later with my daughter he was indifferent at best to the news that we were having a girl.

FIL has four grandchildren, 2 boys from BIL and his wife, and 1 boy and 1 girl from my husband and me. He fawns over my nephews (whatever, they live right across the street and we live about a 10 min drive away), tries to be present for my son, and acts like he doesn't care that my daughter exists. We have requested that my children not receive more nicknack type toys - this request has been frequently ignored by FIL; but to add insult to injury it was my nephew's birthday and we were all together, FIL decided to get the other nephew something also (whatever, his $) - he also bought something from my son, all the while leaving my daughter out completely.

If we are over for a family meal (which is most saturday evenings) and the kids are getting a bit too rough/loud for my preferences, I will ask my children to settle down/stop running inside/ use inside voices... (not my nephews unless they were harming my children). FIL will retort, 'My house, my rules and I didn't tell them no'. It is his house, but it was only my children that I was correcting because I, as the mother of said children, deemed the behavior inappropriate. There are also issues where I've told my kids that they need to need to try something before being allowed dessert (or seconds of something else) and FIL decided that it's acceptable to allow my children the desserts or the seconds without them having tried the other food.

Add to this list other similar issues and the result is that I'm ready disallow FIL from seeing (even pictures) my children or getting any information updates on the kid's lives (5m,3f). As far as I'm concerned by his continued disrespect for my daughter and myself, FIL is making an active choice to be completely removed from both of my children's lives - no pictures, no visits, no general info updates...

MIL is a sweetheart and we get along great, she would be welcome to stop by and visit the kids if she came w/o FIL. Potential cousin issue - since the cousins live right across the street from FIL any visits between the two groups would need to be at a 'neutral' location like a park so that FIL wouldn't see my children while they are visiting their cousins

72,1d2viy6,AITA for wanting to share a private hotel room in Vegas with my bf for my friend’s bachelor/bachelorette party?,"My friend and her fiancée decided to have a joint party in Vegas a week before their wedding. My bf is friends with her fiancée so he is coming on the trip as well. 

We started getting ideas going and my friend said we would stay in one room and drive up together since my boyfriend was driving the guys up. I wasn’t into the driving part so I was going to fly up and meet them later (hadn’t told them yet because this is months prior). 

Two months before the trip my friend texts me asking if they can use my car to drive to Vegas. I said no that I was planning on flying. She responded surprised since my boyfriend was driving (he loves roadtrips and I really do not and the flight is really short from where I live). 

So eventually my friend reaches out to the group chat and announces that we are all flying to Vegas instead since we don’t have a car. Then there is silence on dates and times for flights for weeks. She has provided no further information. 

My birthday comes around and my friend decides not to acknowledge it or say anything to me. She commonly does this when she is mad at me and it’s her petty way of showing it. I am out of town visiting family but my boyfriend is going over to see my friend so I ask him to try to see what is going on. He claims she’s upset because I haven’t booked a flight yet so she doesn’t know if I am coming. How am I supposed to book a flight if none of us have been given information? 

So I reach out to the chat and ask if we have picked a time and some other girls send me their ticket info. So great I buy a ticket and just ignore that they didn’t communicate with everyone. (Also I’m not the only one in the group who hadn’t been told about these tickets until I asked about them, so why take the anger out on me?) 

Once I buy the ticket then they start talking hotel rooms. My boyfriend and I had already decided to get a room together since the girls had booked a room full before I had the chance to get the PTO approved from work (and I wanted my own bathroom). 

My friend then asks me and one of the girls who I have never met before to get a hotel room together, just the two of us. We would be paying more than the other room of 4 girls which I thought was unfair. I told them I was planning on staying with my boyfriend because he didn’t want to share with the guys. 

Then my friend starts messaging me saying I’m ruining the girls/guys trip. All we would do is sleep in the room and spend the rest of the time with our respective groups. I just need to know if I am being an ahole or if I should just jump ship on this trip all together.

I'll try keep this short...
My bil is insisting that he has contributed equally to fil Stone unveiling, but we have a laundry list of reasons to believe we have in fact been manipulated into paying the entire thing. 

His only  'proof' is a screenshot of him sending 'his' portion to a 3rd party via bank transfer, and a second screen shot of him forwarding our portion to the 3rd party, which we reluctantly paid to him. (Unfortunately necessary due to circumstances I won't get into). 

Thing is...and this is what we need the sanity check on... although the date is different on each and time differs by precisely an hour, the BANK RECEIPT number is identical on each! In addition, the currency conversion is also 100% identical to the 4th decimal despite each being (supposedly) transfered 7 days apart. 

Is this even possible? Everything we know tells us recipt numbers HAVE to be unique each time but when we called him out on this, he has reacted very defensively and insists we are wrong.

..though tellingly he can't explain it but only complains as to why we look at such details. 

We are 99.99% sure he is gaslighting us.

Is this even possible? Everything we know tells us recipt numbers HAVE to be unique each time but when we called him out on this, he has reacted very defensively and insists we are wrong.

..though tellingly he can't explain it but only complains as to why we look at such details. 

We are 99.99% sure he is gaslighting us.
Is there is a chance we are wrong?",0.0,0.983012855052948,1,0
74,1d2vcqs,AITA for requesting that my birthday gift cards not be used for everyday purchases?,"UPDATE: We sat down and talked about this after the kids went to bed and cleared the air. She started of still really adversarial about it but we eventually got down to the real issue and our disconnect in terms of how we believe gift cards like mine can and should be used.

First of all, she was irritated with me because she was having a tough day at work and claimed my bringing this up ""ruined her lunch break"" as it didn't allow her to relax. I'd only brought it up because her lunch breaks are our only chance to talk during the work day, and I had only meant to verify that she knew she had used by gift cards and nothing more. I call her on her lunch break every day, and this topic just happened to come up in conversation. I didn't call specifically to talk about this. She was also irritated because she didn't understand why I would even be mildly annoyed because it just seemed logical to her to use the balance since we were placing the order now versus the money sitting there until I eventually ordered something. She knew I had ordered something already but didn't know when I'd be using the rest (and neither did I, really) so she figured...why not just use it? She didn't consider it ""my money"" anymore once it was in the account and figured I would be fine with ordering whatever and putting it on the credit card.

This mostly stems from the fact that she uses her own gift cards, usually Target and Costco but sometimes Amazon, whether received from work or from family and friends for birthdays and Christmas, for things we need versus things for herself. I wasn't aware of this, mostly because she knew if she told me I would insist she treats herself rather than spend the money on necessities. She assumed I would be okay with using mine in the same manner.

In the end we realized we simply have different thoughts about how gift cards should be used, and in the future she'll ask first before using any gift card balances, and I'll simply only input them into the account as I use them versus loading them all in at once. Both of those changes together should prevent this from happening again. Best of all, we were able to end the evening on a happy note, no longer irritated at each other. She saw I had the item in the cart I had wanted and placed the order for me.

UPDATE 2: We just set up her own Amazon account and linked it to our Prime Membership, so this will not be an issue again in the future. It will mainly help keep gifts a surprise when we order things for each other or have the kids pick things for us, but it will also avoid anyone using the other's gift card like this going forward.

Original Post:

I recently celebrated my birthday, and a large portion of my gifts were, by request, Amazon gift cards. I added the balance of each card to our account and ordered an item, and had some funds left over. Today I went to order a few more items only to discover that my gift card balance was $0.00. I was confused and surprised, and at first thought something had gone wrong. Maybe I ordered more than I meant to with my first purchase...and then I remembered my wife had placed an order for some items for our kids the day before. I checked the order details and sure enough, she used the remainder of my gift cards on those items. It was everyday stuff like mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, etc.

I asked her if she realized she had used my gift cards for this purchase and she said yes and that “we might as well, better than paying out of pocket.” I expressed annoyance since that money was for my use and not to use towards everyday items, to which she replied “So just buy what you want and pay out of pocket, it’ll all come out even”  I understand...if she hadn’t used the gift cards we would have paid for those items out of pocket and we’ll end up spending the same amount anyway. Yet something still bothered me about it, mostly because she used the money without informing me, leading to my momentary confusion when I went to place an order. It also just seems somewhat rude to use someone’s birthday money for everyday things, especially without telling them first.

I wasn’t angry, just mildly annoyed and I asked her, in the future, to not use my gift cards for her own orders. It’s simple enough to uncheck the box that says “use gift card balance” and if, as she says, it doesn’t matter in the end, then just don’t use the gift cards. Call it irrational or illogical but when I buy something I want but don’t exactly need (some aesthetic upgrades for my PC in this case) I feel way more guilty about buying them when it’s coming out of pocket versus being covered by a gift card. Again, I realize that it’s six of one, half a dozen of the other but mentally it just \*feels\* different, and now I feel less inclined to spend the money. I’m the one in the family who always watches our budget and manages the money, so my frugal side is saying to let the gift card cover the stuff we need and skip the stuff I want but at the same time, I know that’s not fair.

Meanwhile, my wife is now angry with me for “whining” and “making a big deal out of nothing” when I simply expressed some mild annoyance and asked that I be allowed to use my own money in the future. She’s now talking about opening her own bank account and never ordering from Amazon again to avoid this, which A. wouldn’t solve anything because a separate bank account has nothing to do with Amazon orders (we use an Amazon credit card) and she obviously doesn’t need to stop ordering altogether...just simply don’t use someone else’s gift cards going forward.

75,1d2vb3g,AITA for backing out of lease with GF last minute due to losing my job.,"M (23 currently living alone) and my GF (23yo single Mom W/ 4yo kid) were just about to sign a lease for a 1 year term out of town and I find out the day before signing that the company I was supposed to work with doesn’t need me anymore. We had both our names on the lease and were about to sign it but due to my lack of work in the new area I decided not to follow through.

 The landlord at first was willing to rent it in her name alone since she makes enough to cover the rent and works in that town but now he wants me on the lease as well, I was gonna help her with the down payment but as I still have work here where I’m at I’m hesitant to sign off on the lease If I’m not going to be staying in that house or town until another job offer comes up which I have no idea when that could be. 

She really wanted this place since it helps her out a lot and she works in the town of said apartment but I don’t want to sign the lease if I’m going to still be living and working in another town while also being legally responsible for half of the house and it’s expenses. (Even tho she said she would pay until I find work)

She also seems upset with me about the whole situation since we talked about moving in and we were excited about the whole idea of living together, but my gut feeling is telling me that it’s not a good idea financially. She currently has her own apartment out here in the town I’m working/living in that she’s been staying at, the only thing is she has to drive 45minutes to work in the morning and would rather move as it helps her out. 

While she was texting with the landlord he stated to her that I am a “Red flag” and I think that got into her head as well, the whole vibe with her has just been off ever since I spoke on my situation and why I don’t want to sign the lease. AITA?

(TLDR; I backed out of a lease with my GF last minute because I lost and have no work in the new area of lease (where she is working) and am currently working where I am at, she has her own  car and apartment where we currently live but drives 45minutes to work and wants to move as it helps her out. AITA?)

P.S : we’ve been dating for 2 months but talking for about 4.

77,1d2v8ot,AITA for Setting Boundaries with a Difficult Roommate and Her Destructive Cat?,"Hi Reddit fam,

I need your judgment on a situation with my former roommate, J (33F). I (31F) lived with my previous roommate, A (30F), and her well-behaved cat for seven years. We shared a place for four years before moving to our current apartment, where we stayed for three more years. When A decided to move out, I invited J, a friend who had previously lived with me rent-free for two months, to move in because her current place was too expensive.

Here’s some backstory: When J lived with me rent-free, her cat often peed and pooped in my room, which I tolerated, thinking the cat was just adjusting. Eventually, J moved out, and we stayed friends. When A moved out, J moved in earlier than planned, so I nudged A to leave a bit sooner. J and I agreed to split the rent equally, even though I had a larger closet.

Problems started immediately. J’s cat peed everywhere, ruining my shoes, bathroom rugs, and other belongings. Despite my suggestions to check for health issues or get a new litter box, J did nothing for 11 months. Even then, the cat began scratching the window screens, causing significant damage that J refused to acknowledge, blaming A’s cat instead.

Aside from the cat issues, J was a terrible housemate. She never cleaned, left dirty dishes for days, went on vacations without cleaning up, and used my shower brush to clean up cat messes. When I'd mention something she'd say I was micromanaging. She also left items in shared spaces against our lease terms.

After nearly a year, J insisted I should pay more rent because of my larger closet, despite her cat causing so much damage. I suggested she pay a pet deposit to the landlord or we split the rent, but the landlord decided he didn’t want a pet at all, so we had to hide her cat. This caused tension, and she refused to split the rent as we originally agreed.

When I got a boyfriend, he visited a few times a week, but J complained, even though she had multiple guests over frequently. Including her best friend who stayed for free at the apartment for the last 2 months she was living there, which she never discussed with me. Eventually, she decided to break the lease early and move out. She rented a carpet cleaning machine to clean her carpet but chose not to replace the damaged screens (which were damaged months before she left) due to availability of the size. she used some quick-fix tape. She left heavy pet stains and a viscious candle wax spill on the carpet. The landlord took 90% of her deposit for the damage, and J blocked me on everything, leaving a nasty letter with personal attacks. I genuinley don't think it was my fault nor could I have seen that coming.

78,1d2v7nw,WIBTA for not seeing my father?,"i (16f) and my father (43 m) have never been on good terms. my parents divorced when i was around 8. 

originally, i thought it was a civil divorce where no one was at fault. i had assumed that they simply did not work out and my mother (43 f) told me i would understand when i was older. 

my dad married again about 6 months after the divorce to a woman who he worked with. i ended up staying with them every other weekend and wednesday nights. it was rough. she was very strict with many rules like no running in the house, no yelling, no coming out of our rooms before 8:30 am (they would lock their bedroom door), and many other rules. i can’t remember them all off the top of my head but i remember crying almost the whole time i was there every single time. she also had two kids which treated me very, very poorly. 

they ended up divorcing after a few years and maybe 2 years ago my dad started to date another woman. i’m fine with her. i don’t really like nor dislike her, because she’s not really relivant to the story and because i rarely see her. 

me and my dad always argued throughout all this. he would make us leave my mom’s house on christmas day (and really any holiday) to drive up to his parent’s house which is around 2 hours away on really curvy roads. i get extremely carsick and would regularly throw up. 

 about a year ago i was working at a fast food place with a friend, i’ll call him M. M was a student at the high school my dad’s ex wife taught at and randomly mentioned how much he hated this teacher. she had the same last name as me. well, come to find out, she was my dad’s ex wife. after lots of talking i realized that my dad had actually cheated on my mom with her. 

i go to confront my mom and she tells me the whole story. apparently, my mom had been having lots of pressure at work from this older man who was her boss. he was always pressuring her and many of her other female coworkers to have dinner with him or be around him more than they were comfortable with. he also happened to be my dad’s best friend. 

my dad ‘caught’ them at dinner one night when someone took a picture of them and sent it to him and he decided he was so hurt that he had to (his words) cheat on my mom. apparently he began cheating with the previously mentioned woman and when my mom confronted him he admitted it. when my mom begged him to try to work out their marriage, he didn’t want to and forced her to divorce him. all the while he was expecting my mother to be happy for him and tried to force her to let him stay in the house.  


so, here’s my question, would i be TAH for not wanting to see him now and once i turn 18? should i confront him, should i just not say anything and ignore him?

 i am aware that both my parents are human. i detailed everything my mom did ‘wrong’ and left out no details about her. i did leave out details about my father, such as how he refuses to pay enough in child support.

79,1d2v3gf,AITA for slut-shaming a friend?,"Disclaimer that there is more to the story & this has been simplified to meet character limit. 

Mai (F) had a bad reputation, especially losing all her girlfriends and keeping most of her guy friends. She entered our social circle through the sorority I was in. Mai got along with the boys & this didn’t make the girls happy, but i gave her a chance anyways.

A LOT of the girls called her an attention-seeker and other things. We became good friends but I had a hard time trusting her because of what the girls would tell me. They said she would flirt with their boyfriends, go out of her way to hang out with them & wont acknowledge them as the girlfriend.

Mai and I end up in a misunderstanding with the guys always pitting us against each other. I tried my best not to take it seriously, but it was hard when the girls would always talk badly of her. Mai and I clear the air and start talking again.

I start seeing Sam (M), who I met through a co-rush event. We were on & off because I wasn't ready to commit to him and he knew that. I brought him to a friend's party where him and Mai met. I got upset seeing how touchy she got with him even though she knew he was my date to the party. I joked that maybe he'd end up dating her instead but he said he knew Mai only wanted attention and he wanted me not her.

I tell Sam I wanted to commit to him and we start talking again after a month. We end up hooking up for the first time and thats when it started to feel off. He tells me that I did nothing but hurt him and lead him on. I was confused since, we've only known each other for a month when I first brought him to a party, I only mostly saw him at parties, & he was talking to other girls besides me. I felt used.

Week later, group goes to a party. I end up drunk and find Mai and Sam cuddling together on the couch. His arms around her and he lends her his letterman jacket, same one I've worn before. I felt upset and betrayed.

Liz and Ana (F), brought up to me how they didn't like seeing Mai with Sam. Ana especially says how she hates when Mai gets drunk because she gets really touchy with the guys. Liz just straight up slut shames Mai. 2 other guys also tell me how what Sam and Mai did was disrespectful. Everyone was feeding me fire.

Sam and I get into an argument. His excuse is that he has a girlfriend and he wasn't trying to get with Mai. This party happened 2 weeks after we broke things off so I think its crazy that he got a gf that quick. I blew up on him, said she wasn't my friend and that none of the girls liked her either.

Mai hears about everything I said because Sam told her and she felt slut-shamed. People who I thought would back me up, all dropped me. The girls who instigated the hate towards her, stopped talking to me.

I felt bad for saying things about Mai, but was it right for everyone to stop being friends with me? No one explained what I did wrong to them and they all still talk to Sam.",Asshole,2024-05-28,"AITA for slut-shaming a friend? Disclaimer that there is more to the story & this has been simplified to meet character limit. 

Mai (F) had a bad reputation, especially losing all her girlfriends and keeping most of her guy friends. She entered our social circle through the sorority I was in. Mai got along with the boys & this didn’t make the girls happy, but i gave her a chance anyways.

A LOT of the girls called her an attention-seeker and other things. We became good friends but I had a hard time trusting her because of what the girls would tell me. They said she would flirt with their boyfriends, go out of her way to hang out with them & wont acknowledge them as the girlfriend.

Mai and I end up in a misunderstanding with the guys always pitting us against each other. I tried my best not to take it seriously, but it was hard when the girls would always talk badly of her. Mai and I clear the air and start talking again.

I start seeing Sam (M), who I met through a co-rush event. We were on & off because I wasn't ready to commit to him and he knew that. I brought him to a friend's party where him and Mai met. I got upset seeing how touchy she got with him even though she knew he was my date to the party. I joked that maybe he'd end up dating her instead but he said he knew Mai only wanted attention and he wanted me not her.

I tell Sam I wanted to commit to him and we start talking again after a month. We end up hooking up for the first time and thats when it started to feel off. He tells me that I did nothing but hurt him and lead him on. I was confused since, we've only known each other for a month when I first brought him to a party, I only mostly saw him at parties, & he was talking to other girls besides me. I felt used.

We didn't communicate much with her; mostly, I initiated conversations, and she responded dryly or commented on how she didn't like something. Eventually, she stopped responding altogether and complained to him that I didn't write to her.

She's so selfish because she knows about these problems and she says that she's too old to change and we need to accept her the way she is. There are a lot of things to say, but during our long-distance relationship, only I was traveling to meet him. He didn't try to visit me because of his mom.

81,1d2uw5r,AITA for not moving out to help my sister start her family?,"My husband and I, both in our late 30s, have been living in a 3-bedroom house owned by my parents in Los Angeles for a little over a year. We have a lease agreement to stay here for five years while we save enough for a down payment on a home.

My sister and her husband, both in their early 30s, are planning to move back to LA from out of state and start a family. Given the high cost of housing and rent, they’ve struggled to find a place to live. While my sister hasn’t directly asked us to move out, she has hinted at it, and our mom has strongly suggested it, primarily because my husband and I don’t plan on having children. They believe it would be best for my sister and her future kids if we vacate our current home.

My husband and I have discussed this and decided to stay until we are explicitly told to leave. Even then, we plan to bring up our verbal agreement to stay for at least another four years. With the current housing market and economic conditions, buying a home is not feasible for us right now. If we were to rent another place, our budget would only allow for a one-bedroom apartment, which isn’t ideal given that I work from home and need the extra space.

We are comfortable where we are and have been diligently saving to eventually buy our first home. However, I can’t help but feel guilty for potentially hindering my sister's plans to start a family because they can’t afford a place of their own. As the older sister, I wonder if I’m being unreasonable. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: To clarify some things:

1) We pay rent of $3,000. With 10% increases each year. Not living there for free.  
2) We have a written lease that is now month to month.  
3) The ""verbal agreement"" part was that we are planning to stay there for about 5 years. Still month to month.

He did not ever mean a down payment for a home in Colorado, where my wife and I have lived since we were in college.

My Dad confronted us about this because we won’t come for a summer break trip and told me that I was being a selfish, entitled brat because I hadn’t gotten my way. That I was essentially punishing the rest of the family because we “assumed” what his gift would be.

I drove to the store and got a refund as the 30day refund policy was very close. She was very hurt that “hated it so much that I had to return it”

89,1d2tg3l,AITA for argument with LDR GF?,"Hello strangers,

My gf went out to enjoy festival in her city. I supported her, telling to go out and have fun with family and friends, because it was 1 year since she was home.

I told her i only had 3 conditions.

1) ENJOY
2) don’t get wasted (due to SA(happened before we started to date))
3) to update me once she is home

My issue is that i said to update me when she is home, because i wanted to enjoy a bit of time for myself.

After she came home from festival she was drinking with her cousins and siblings, i wasn’t included in conversation, since i don’t speak their native launguage.

I told her to end the call so she can enjoy rest of night with family. But she was calling me non stop so i was in call, silent.. Then she told me we can talk, but i just didn’t want to due to interrupting their conversation, and her talking to me for 15 seconds and back to original conversation for 5-10 minutes each time.

If I were ever tested and diagnosed as being somewhere on the autism spectrum I don’t think a single person I’m close to would be surprised. I have not been tested/diagnosed so I can’t say it’s an excuse, but that’s just how my personality seems to be.

 I (41M) don’t like funerals. I’m not squeamish or bothered by them I just personally don’t get the point and usually sit there very bored trying not to fidget/look bored. I get that some people need them for closure but I just don’t. I also don’t begrudge anyone for doing what they feel they need to I just don’t want to be part of it. That being said, I go to funerals of close family/friends but maybe not for my 2^(nd) cousin twice removed whom I’ve met once.  
My GF (42F) has recently had a few funerals she’s gone to and has expected me to attend with her. The first one required me to take off of work in the middle of a busy time and I told her I couldn’t. She convinced me to go with her and I told my boss I needed a few hours off (basically half a day because it was a late-morning thing) to attend the funeral. He was fine with it and asked how I knew the person. I said “it’s my GF’s cousin’s wife’s stepfather”…and saying it out loud just made me feel silly for taking off of work for something like that. For clarification, I have never met this person and my GF has never mentioned him in the 5 or so years we’ve been together. This is not someone either of us were close to but she felt obligated to go and, thus, I was also expected to feel obligated. A few weeks after that I agreed to go with her to another funeral of her coworker. There were literally 6 eulogies, several songs/poems, and an outright sermon making the church portion somewhere around 2-2.5 hours long. After that I’m kind of to the point where I’m going to tell her if she feels obligated to go then that’s fine but I shouldn’t then feel obligated also. 

For just a bit more clarification (just in case): her grandfather died a few years ago and the thought of not going to that funeral never even crossed my mind. I knew it was someone important to her and she would probably like someone there with her for whatever she might have needed. If it’s anyone even remotely close there wouldn’t be a second thought on my part, just for the people neither of us know very well I really don't want to go. Also, we are not having a fight about this or anything, she hasn't tried to make me feel bad about the one I missed. I'm just trying to get an unbiased assessment of my feelings.

93,1d2s8av,AITA for snapping at my stepsister after she tried to get her mom to ruin a trip?,"Throwaway because I have family on my main account.

I have a stepsister, “Ellie” who is the same age as me. Ellie has a brother, “Seb”, who is two years older than us. Our parents (my dad, their mom) got married three years ago. Seb has 30/70 time at his mom’s, while I have 70/30 at my mom’s. Ellie has 90/10 at her mom’s. 

Seb and I are close, but Ellie isn’t close to either of us. Pretty much the only reason I go to my dad’s as often as I do is because Seb is there. But it’s become really miserable to go there because of Ellie. She’s incredibly self centred, obnoxious, jealous, and just exhausting to be around because she is a professional victim. Ellie is bullied in school and apparently has been for her whole life, so doesn’t have any of her own friends. Because of this her mom always forces Seb and me to take her everywhere with us and it’s really difficult for us to just hang out in a room without her. Ellie actively participates in this by tattling on us and demanding her mom tell us to include her. When Seb isn’t there it’s not as bad because my dad won’t force me to do anything but since he’s not Seb and Ellie’s parent he doesn’t intervene. 

Four days ago I was at my dad’s and I mentioned to my dad that I had been invited to go with Seb and his dad to a sporting event in July. Ellie overheard this (I didn’t know she was home) and went to tattle to her mom, who came down and interrogated me. I only answered when the event was because beyond that she should be talking to her ex and my dad said as much. Ellie said it wasn’t fair that Seb was taking me and not her, and her mom agreed and said she would “fix it” and Ellie had this smug smile on her face, which was the last straw. I said she is a cruel person for ruining this and for never wanting anyone to be happy except herself. I also said that I have no idea what she enjoyment she gets from forcing her presence on people because it doesn’t make anyone like her and if it’s just fun for her to make me and her brother miserable then that should embarrass her. Then I told my dad he’s being a crappy dad for not standing up for me more and I went back to my mom’s. 

Apparently things devolved into caplets chaos after I left. Ellie cried for hours and according to my dad won’t speak to anyone now and has taken two days off school. Her mom is livid with me, and her ex for letting Seb invite me on the trip, and Seb for inviting me. Also now neither I or Seb really want to go over there because it’s a shit show so that’s caused issues between all the parents. 

My dad is saying this is my fault for saying all that to Ellie and that I need to apologise. I don’t think I do, because honestly I think someone else is Ellie’s life should have said that to her earlier. Maybe I was harsh about it but it’s something she needs to think about.

Now, my father and I aren't close. Far from it. There had been a lot of compilations with my mother's health when I was born, and she passed away not to long after. Afterwards, my father practically dumped me off onto his father, my grandfather, who raised me instead.

95,1d2rpqd,AITA? Previous home owner is trying to stick me with the bill,"So I’ve (m24) never posted on here before but I’m looking for an opinion on a situation I’ve found myself in. I bought a duplex from an elderly couple about 6 months ago to live in one half and rent out the other the duplex was completely trashed on one side, needed a full remodel and the other side was probably a 5/10 and needed a lot of cosmetic work. I negotiated a fair deal and agreed to clean everything out myself because I knew the elderly couple couldn’t. 

Part of the deal was that their adult son in his 50’s let’s call him Mike would stay in one side of the duplex for 3 months after I purchased it so that they could get the rest of their belongings out and the adult son could finish out his job and then move with his parents to another state. This wasn’t an issue because I intended to renovate the side that needed the full remodel during that three months. 

The issues started popping as soon as his parents left. Mike took the other unit from a 5/10 to a 2/10 in a matter of weeks. Letting his dog use one of the bedrooms as a bathroom. Leaving open food every where attracting   bugs and generally just being disgusting and sitting around all day while he was supposed to be packing. I decided to keep quiet because I knew I was going to have to do a lot of work on that side anyway and I didn’t want to make it harder for his parents who had been in and out of the hospital. The three months had come and gone and Mike was far from finished packing his and his parents stuff and was demanding more to which I said he could pay market rent for more time or he could leave because I needed to fix that side to move my family into it. He got mad and said they couldn’t pay to which I said he couldn’t stay. He left a lot of their stuff here and I had to throw most of it away due to it be infested with bugs but I kept things I thought would be sentimental and sent them to the elderly couple. They started sending extended family over at odd times to try and take things from the house while my wife and daughter were there and I had to make them leave on several occasions. 

Everything was quiet for a month or so and then I start getting messages demanding that I pay the past due utilities on the side that Mike stayed in for those three months. At this point I’m fed up with it and I tell them that I won’t be doing that as kindly as I can. And they proceed to threaten me and call me a piece of shit. AITA?

I negotiated a fair deal and agreed to clean everything out myself because I knew the elderly couple couldn’t. 

Part of the deal was that their adult son in his 50’s let’s call him Mike would stay in one side of the duplex for 3 months after I purchased it so that they could get the rest of their belongings out and the adult son could finish out his job and then move with his parents to another state. This wasn’t an issue because I intended to renovate the side that needed the full remodel during that three months. 

The issues started popping as soon as his parents left. Mike took the other unit from a 5/10 to a 2/10 in a matter of weeks. Letting his dog use one of the bedrooms as a bathroom. Leaving open food every where attracting   bugs and generally just being disgusting and sitting around all day while he was supposed to be packing. I decided to keep quiet because I knew I was going to have to do a lot of work on that side anyway and I didn’t want to make it harder for his parents who had been in and out of the hospital. The three months had come and gone and Mike was far from finished packing his and his parents stuff and was demanding more to which I said he could pay market rent for more time or he could leave because I needed to fix that side to move my family into it. He got mad and said they couldn’t pay to which I said he couldn’t stay. He left a lot of their stuff here and I had to throw most of it away due to it be infested with bugs but I kept things I thought would be sentimental and sent them to the elderly couple. They started sending extended family over at odd times to try and take things from the house while my wife and daughter were there and I had to make them leave on several occasions. 

Everything was quiet for a month or so and then I start getting messages demanding that I pay the past due utilities on the side that Mike stayed in for those three months. At this point I’m fed up with it and I tell them that I won’t be doing that as kindly as I can. And they proceed to threaten me and call me a piece of shit. AITA?
EDIT: there was a standard lease agreement in place stating that they were responsible for utilities. I changed the utilities of the other unit into my name right after closing ",4.0,0.016140956431627274,0,0
96,1d2rnvd,AITA for refusing to pay for my younger sister's wedding despite my parents insistence?,"
Hi everyone to start this off I just came here to tell you about what happened. This is a bit long, but I need to get this off my chest. I'm a 32-year-old man, and I have a younger sister,
who we will call Emily, who is 24. My parents have always spoiled her, and it’s only gotten worse as we’ve gotten older. I don’t mind helping family, but this situation has gone too far. Here’s the story.

I started working right out of college, saved diligently, and now I own a small but successful business. My parents, on the other hand, haven't been great with money. They’ve always lived beyond their means, and as a result, they never really had savings to fall back on.

Emily, being the youngest, was pampered throughout her childhood and teenage years. She got everything she wanted – new car at 16, fully funded college tuition (which she dropped out of), and frequent shopping sprees. I, on the other hand, worked part-time jobs and took out student loans to get through school.

Fast forward to now: Emily is getting married to her boyfriend of two years. They announced the engagement a few months ago, and my parents were over the moon. They immediately started planning a lavish wedding, far beyond what they can afford. Naturally, they turned to me for financial support.

At first, it was small things – ""Can you help with the engagement party?"" and ""Could you chip in for the dress?"" I agreed, thinking it wouldn’t be much. But then they started asking for more – ""We need help with the venue deposit,"" and ""The catering is going to cost a lot, can you cover it?""

I sat down with them and explained that while I’m doing well financially, I’m not made of money, and I have my own expenses and future to think about. They brushed it off, saying it’s my duty to help family, especially my sister. They even suggested I take out a loan if necessary.

The last straw was when they asked me to pay for the honeymoon. I put my foot down and told them I’m done funding the wedding. My parents were furious. They accused me of being selfish and ungrateful, saying that family should come first. Emily, of course, sided with them and is now barely speaking to me. She’s posting passive-aggressive stuff on social media about ""selfish people"" and ""not being able to rely on family.""

My parents are now telling everyone in our extended family that I’m refusing to help my sister in her time of need, and I’m getting a lot of backlash. Some relatives have called to scold me, while others are staying out of it. I’m starting to feel guilty, but at the same time, I think it’s unfair to expect me to bankroll such an extravagant event.

So am I the asshole for this?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for refusing to pay for my younger sister's wedding despite my parents insistence?

98,1d2rjfy,AITA for excluding and being mean to a guy from an exchange?,"AITA for excluding and being mean to a guy at an exchange?

So I (female) did an exchange and I met an acquaintance of my exchange student. She told me he wasn’t getting along with his exchange student (she was crying the whole time because of him, which I learned later on) and that he was alone.

She warned me of him but I didn’t mind much at that time. At first, I thought he was nice, extroverted and open.
But it got weird pretty fast when he constantly complimented a friend of mine and me and also only talked about himself. But nothing happened. 

The next day, there was a party organised by the exchange and well yes😐 He drank too much and got really touchy and came too close.
My exchange student noticed and had an argument with him. We both left early. The next day, we all planned on having dinner together and my exchange student and her friends said it would be best if he didn’t come (they also told me they didn’t even know him well and told him before the exchange they wouldn’t spend time with him that much).
I agreed and they told him, but he was very angry. 

He texted multiple friend of mine who were also coming and tried to get an invitation from them, but I already told them what was happening before so they didn’t. I texted him saying “sorry we have a reservation and it would be too many people if you came”. But he called one friend of mine and they had a call for over one hour. 
When I talked to her later she told me it wasn’t okay to be excluding him. 

The next day, I saw a message from the guy I excluded saying “The others told me you didn’t like me?” and I texted with him for a while.
I told him how I felt and that he should respect my boundaries and he kept repeating he didn’t want to be a weight for us and if he’d known we didn’t like him he wouldn’t have spent time with us.

I told the others on that evening, and some of my friends told me I did the right thing and he was very manipulative but the others told me I was too harsh and that he wouldn’t understand because he’s male??
The friend of mine he called eventually screamed at me (yes, she screamed) for talking so bad about him and said that I should be ashamed of myself.

When we left the restaurant, the guy was waiting for us (he was there because it was an exchange event but he left 10min prior). He asked as where we were planning on going and we told him we don’t know and then he left. It was very weird.

When we had our exchange to Italy, he behaved normally around me and the other friend he was touchy with but the friend who screamed at me told me later on he was inappropriate towards her.

Tldr: we adopt a guy because he was very alone during our exchange, guy behaves very weird, gets drunk, behaves inappropriately and touchy during an exchange event, gets angry I didn’t invite him for dinner, texts that he knows I don’t like him, I text him he should learn to respect boundaries and my friend screams at me for being to harsh",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for excluding and being mean to a guy from an exchange?

99,1d2ricu,AITA My step dad is way too friendly and i freaking hate it,"Hey y'all, I gotta vent. I’m a 15-year-old girl, and I live with my mom and my stepdad, Rick (fake name). Rick’s been around for about a year now,and hes been trying really hard to be my friend, but he’s just overstepping boundaries, and it’s making me super uncomfortable.

When Rick first moved in, I thought it was cool he wanted to bond. But now he’s doing way too much. Every single day, he’s tryna hang out, insisting we watch movies or play video games together.Even when i just want to be alone and I’m just tryna chill in my room, but he doesn’t get it.

Rick doesn’t even knock before coming into my room. He just walks in, asking if I wanna do something with him. I’ve told him I need my space, but he’s always like, “I just want us to be close” or “I want to get to know you better.” I get that, but I need my privacy.

One time, I was on FaceTime with my best friend, and Rick just popped in and started talking to her like they were besties. It was so awkward. My friend played along, but I felt so embarrassed. Afterward, I told him he can’t just jump into my conversations, but he looked hurt and said he was just tryna be friendly.

Rick also tries to get involved in my interests, but it feels fake. Like, I’m really into K-pop, and he’ll randomly start talking about it, pretending he knows all the groups and songs. It’s obvious he doesn’t, and it just makes me cringe. I don’t need him to pretend to like what I like.

He even goes as far as tryna join me when I’m doing my hair, asking if he can help or watch. Taking care of my natural hair is a personal thing for me, a time when I can relax and take care of myself. I don’t want an audience or a helper, especially not from someone who doesn’t get what it means to me.

I’ve tried talking to my mom about it, but she thinks it’s sweet that Rick is making an effort. She says I should be more open and let him in, but it’s not that simple. I just don’t feel comfortable being that close to him. It’s nothing personal; I just need my own space to breathe and be myself.

I don’t wanna hurt Rick’s feelings, but I also don’t wanna feel suffocated in my own home. How do I set boundaries without coming off as rude or ungrateful? I want him to understand that while I appreciate his effort, I need my space and time to myself. How do i handle this? Is this just going to be my life now?

102,1d2reky,AITA for wanting to set up a phone someone gifted to me later,"for background im a college student, my dad pays for my rent, tuition and phone plan

a few months ago i accidentally broke my phone and i havent gotten a new one yet since. my plan was to just survive without one for the remainder of the semester and once summer rolled around, get a job for the summer and purchase a new one after earning enough money. however before i got that job my mom wanted me to visit her for a few weeks and i accepted since im an important person to her and we only get to see eachother one or two times a year. when i told her i havent had a phone for a short while now she offered to give me a spare phone she happened to have and intended to sell, which while i felt tentative to accept i ended up saying yes to, since she said it was a spare anyways and itd be rude decline such a generous offer like this.

So I have 4 sisters
All 3 of my older sisters have had debts paid off by my grandparents, they have had their homes furnished and carpeted. And she's made a big point to help them especially with their carpets as it's quite pricey. They never asked, she just offered! She has helped them massively over the years. 
I myself have never ever asked for a penny, even in the hardest times where I needed it, I never asked as I'm just not one to ask for help and when I do ask for help (small favours) it's always a no... so I just don't bother.
In the next year I'll be moving into a new home and I would love the extra help if offered. I mean, my grandma paid for my sisters carpets and I would love it if she did it for me, I don't like to ask so im hoping she would offer.
BUT if she doesn't offer, I will ask nicely if she could help me as she helped the older girls... I have a strong feeling she's gonna say no. I don't know why but I just do. Would I be an ass if I get a bit annoyed about this if she does say no?
I want to save myself looking like a spoiled brat if I do show how it will upset me when I do get rejected, perhaps she might help me but she has always favouritised them over me and my younger sister. 
My partner has told me to not even bother asking as they will just throw it in our faces anyway but we do struggle with saving and could really do with that extra bit of money 

UPDATE:
I have decided not to bother asking, if my grandma did help me, I know I would never hear the last of it anyway and that's not something I want
Also if she did help she would probably only do it because she felt pressured or like she HAS to! I'd rather help from someone who truly wants to help. ",Asshole,2024-05-28,"WIBTA if I get annoyed with my grandparents for not helping me with my new home but helps my siblings?

106,1d2q9nv,AITA for going home when my friend changed the plans? ,"A few weeks ago a university event was going on and a friend, Clara (19F), invited me (19F) and a couple others back to her house afterward (she lives very close to the venue). A few people were going to a bar immediately after the event, but our plan was to go back to hers and go to the bar much later.

She had left the event around 15 minutes before me, presumably to go home, so I begin to walk back to her house. I soon realise, however, that she had gone back to the bar which she said she didn’t want to. 

I am not bothered at this point, but go into the bar to find her. Of course, everyone from the event is now sat in this bar, and there is MINIMAL room for anyone else to sit. I say to her, are you planning on staying here for long? She says only around 30 minutes, so, already frustrated, I sit ALONE and wait for her to finally get up and commit to her original plan. Note that she does NOT make ANY attempt to make room for me to sit, but rather dismisses me and returns to her conversation.

I become increasingly frustrated, and return after the 30 minutes has passed. She is showing no signs of movement, but is happily entertaining various men, giggling away as if I have not been sat alone. Becoming increasingly frustrated after an hour, I just left the bar and went home without saying anything. I found it incredibly selfish and, to be honest, upsetting. If she had let me know what she was doing, maybe I could have come to the bar with her in the first place. We never addressed it again.

UNTIL A few weeks later, when she asks me what happened that day. Many people were around, so in an attempt to de-escalate I tell her ‘it’s fine, we will talk about it later’, to which she responds ‘NO, it’s not fine. You left without saying goodbye?’ In an accusatory, outraged way. What??? You made plans and effectively cancelled them on me, with no intentions of including me in your new plans. Am I the asshole?

108,1d2pqo5,WIBTA: Noise Complaint for Barking Dog,"So, just moved to a new city. Love my new apartment. But the dogs... let me explain.

This complex is ruled by barking dogs. My biggest issue and my WIBTA is about dog #1 and #3. Especially #3.

Building layout context; I live in a 4 unit complex, two units downstairs, two units upstairs. I'm on the top floor and my balcony faces into the parking lots/green space with other buildings.

**Dog #1 I hate:** My direct downstairs neighbor has these two dogs. He's elderly and tbh looks as pale as death. My balcony sits right overtop his porch space. He has a little slice of yard and he lets his two chubby, gotta be maybe 30 lbs soaking wet dogs poop and pee on it. He doesn't clean it up either so the poops just fester there. It's gunna be the heat of the summer soon and I've already contemplated my move for fixing that situation.

**WIBHA** if I go to him and offer to help him clean up after his dogs since I can smell the dog poop in my apt when I have the balcony door open/sit on the balcony. I feel like it'd be technically a nice gesture but also a ""hey I smell your dogs shit, clean up after your animals"" nudge. WIBTA?

**Dog #2 I hate:** My upstairs neighbor, directly to the left facing my unit, has this dog that barks every time I walk past their door to get to my door. I hate it. They never walk their dog other than to bring it outside to bark at its shadow and pee and nip at passing people. Not much I can do about it. It just sucks. Needed to vent.

**Dog #3 I LOATH:** OKAY. This dog. I hate this dog. The neighbors directly across from my unit, in another building, in the downstairs unit have this tiny yappy little shih tzu looking dog that *does not stop barking* when it's left on their patio. Barks at everything. I've only seen the dog once outside of the apt and it was running like crazy up and down the parking area. But they leave it outside for hours on their porch, usually between 4-6 PM when I'm just finishing work, wanting to read outside on the balcony and catch the last bit of the sun and relax. And it just barks, and barks, and barks.

**WIBTA** if I send in a noise complaint to the city? It goes on public record and I really don't want my name anywhere, nor to put those people in any sort of trouble. But also, take care of your dog? WIBTA?

--

I know none of this dogs are at fault which is why it makes me feel weird about wanting to complain about dog #3. It's the dog owners in this apt unit being the worst dog owners in the world. But I also don't want to get anyone in trouble. Just want the dog to stop barking for hours on end.

I will never understand why people get a pet to let it rot beside them. If you have or are thinking about getting a dog, just walk the thing. Make the poor animal happy and loved. Or don't get one.

109,1d2pn6x,AITA for asking my younger brother to take responsibility for the family pets for 3 days?,"(I’m a 17 year old girl btw) 

My family bought a caravan a few years ago and since then try to spend as much time as we can down there. When it was first bought we had two Labrador’s and two rabbits. We’d take our labradors with us and pay one of my cousins (who lives very close by) to take care of the rabbits while we’re gone. However, we recently bought a cat as well who hasn’t had his injections yet so I’d stay home by myself and takes care of all the pets while the rest of my family go down to the caravan. I generally don’t mind this and I’ve been doing it more and more often. 

Now our cat is old enough to come down with us and I’ve began coming down as well, but due to my aunt (who had severe cat allergies) going down I stayed home again with all the pet’s. This was roughly for 4 days. Earlier today my mum asked if I wanted to go down with her and my grand parents because my dad and younger brother (15) would be home. I honestly did want to go down but my dad would be working a lot and my brother isn’t the most mature so I was uncomfortable with the idea of them being left in charge of them, despite my younger brother claiming he could do so. My younger brother isn’t the type to be given responsibilities to. He doesn’t remember to feed the cat, he never cleans his litter tray, and he refuses to set an alarm to let the rabbits out of their hutch and feed them in the mornings (he sleeps really late). So instead I decided to stay home but asked my brother to take care of all the pet’s needs (like we would have to if I wasn’t there) so I could be more comfortable leaving him in charge of them next time a simular situation comes up. I’m not expecting a lot from him, just to feed them all on time, clean the cat’s litter tray, let the rabbits out of their hutch and put them to bed. He has no responsibilities of his own and is probably going to spend the entirety of his day playing video games or scrolling TicTock on his phone. 

But my younger brother doesn’t like this idea and say’s he doesn’t have to because I’m there, so why should he have to. I tried to explain to him that it was so I could trust that he’d be able to take care of them all in the future so I can relax as well but he refuses to budge. To be clear, the animals aren’t purely my responsibility (unless i’m the only one home) I generally do half of the cat feedings, clean his litter box, deal with the rabbits in the morning and sometimes feed the dogs if my parents are busy.

So AITA for asking my brother to take full responsibility even though I’m there to do it?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for asking my younger brother to take responsibility for the family pets for 3 days? (I’m a 17 year old girl btw)

We’d take our labradors with us and pay one of my cousins (who lives very close by) to take care of the rabbits while we’re gone. However, we recently bought a cat as well who hasn’t had his injections yet so I’d stay home by myself and takes care of all the pets while the rest of my family go down to the caravan. I generally don’t mind this and I’ve been doing it more and more often. 

Now our cat is old enough to come down with us and I’ve began coming down as well, but due to my aunt (who had severe cat allergies) going down I stayed home again with all the pet’s. This was roughly for 4 days. Earlier today my mum asked if I wanted to go down with her and my grand parents because my dad and younger brother (15) would be home. I honestly did want to go down but my dad would be working a lot and my brother isn’t the most mature so I was uncomfortable with the idea of them being left in charge of them, despite my younger brother claiming he could do so. My younger brother isn’t the type to be given responsibilities to. He doesn’t remember to feed the cat, he never cleans his litter tray, and he refuses to set an alarm to let the rabbits out of their hutch and feed them in the mornings (he sleeps really late). So instead I decided to stay home but asked my brother to take care of all the pet’s needs (like we would have to if I wasn’t there) so I could be more comfortable leaving him in charge of them next time a simular situation comes up. I’m not expecting a lot from him, just to feed them all on time, clean the cat’s litter tray, let the rabbits out of their hutch and put them to bed. He has no responsibilities of his own and is probably going to spend the entirety of his day playing video games or scrolling TicTock on his phone. 

But my younger brother doesn’t like this idea and say’s he doesn’t have to because I’m there, so why should he have to. I tried to explain to him that it was so I could trust that he’d be able to take care of them all in the future so I can relax as well but he refuses to budge. To be clear, the animals aren’t purely my responsibility (unless i’m the only one home) I generally do half of the cat feedings, clean his litter box, deal with the rabbits in the morning and sometimes feed the dogs if my parents are busy.

110,1d2phz1,AITA for kicking out my brother for spending money?,"I, 30F, let me younger brother, 22M, move in with me back in mid-Apri beause he and his long-term gf broke up and he was living with her. 
When he moved in, we sat down and had a long talk about what expectations I had and what he thought he could handle. The rules were the following:
1: pay me $100 a week for rent
2: put $200 in his savings account 
3: do not touch the money in his savings account unless there is an emergency 
4: have quantifiable proof he's looking for a place by the 1st of each month
5: would like him out by Aug 1st 
I told him that this was just what I'd thought of and I was more than happy to switch things up based on what he could do/afford. We also sat down and looked over his finances and set up a budget where I'd asked him about all of his expenses (bills, loans, etc.) and he'd agreed to all of the rules I'd set.I looked at his bank accounts and he had about $1000 on his savings and he showed me for the first 2 weeks when he paid his ""rent"" that he'd moved the money into his savings. I even commented on how proud I was of him and he was doing great.
However, as the weeks went by, he got complacent (I think) and I got busy and he ended up putting his rent on the fridge or on the table so I didn't get a chance to check his account to verify (this was going to be for the security deposit and 1st months rent for his new apartment). So yesterday I realized I hadn't checked in a while so I asked him to show me so I could make sure he was on track. He sputtered then told me he had only $400 left after blowing through it all (nearly $1000). I was floored! He has basically no expenses, just a Netflix and a phone bill, so I asked him what the emergency had been that he needed to spend that kind of money and he said there hadn't been one, just things he was doing like going to a concert and weed & stuff. Needless to say, I was incredibly pissed off. 
So here is where I might be the ahole. I told him that he knew the rules about staying with me and what my expectations had been and he wasn't following them and I felt incredibly disrespected and upset because I'd tried to help him and he'd just kicked himself all the way back to step one. I told him I was very much contemplating making him leave.He begged for another chance and apologized and promised to do better. I told him I'd think about it and give him my final answer today. 
I talked it over with my mom and a few friends and my boyfriend and it's pretty evenly split. My mom is on my side and also reminded me that he hasn't done anything to prepare for a new apartment (finding furniture, applying, or even looking). The only time he'd even looked online was when I made him sit down with me and we looked together. But some say that we all made dumb mistakes in our early 20s and I should give him another chance and I'm being too harsh.

111,1d2pcx9,AITA for calling my partner unthoughtful? ,"Some context: I just graduated nursing school two weeks ago and my bf asked me what I wanted as a graduation gift. I told him a camera because I used to have a camera back in high school that stopped working and I really enjoyed using it. I gave him several options a few days before I graduated so that he’d have some time to order one.

 I’m super easy to please usually and don’t expect a lot, but it’s pretty hurtful to me that I have to remind him about a gift that he already said he’d order. The camera I wanted was around $100 and money isn’t really a problem for him so financial struggles aren’t a factor in this problem. It’s become less about the camera and more about the principle to me. I just feel so unheard and unacknowledged by him. 

He usually doesn’t remember stuff I say that’s important to me and it seems to go over his head because he’s too preoccupied with his own worries about life. And I get it, ofc he needs to worry about his life stuff too. But, he’s so forgetful when I mention anything and acts clueless when I tell him stuff that’s important. It’s just getting to a point where it’s starting to piss me off because I moved to a whole new state where I know no one to be with him to end our long distance. 

Once after I graduated, he mentioned something about still waiting to get the camera and I just bypassed it because I was like ok we’ve been busy focusing on the move and stuff. I also have to take an exam to get my license and had to pack up everything and take days off my study time to prep for the move. I just feel like he doesn’t appreciate it and drops the “you’ll be fine” when I bring up how stressed I am about missing study time. I don’t expect anything, but he couldn’t even say a lousy thank you. I’ve told him over 10 times how much I hate it when he says “you’ll be fine” bc I really just like to feel heard or acknowledged when I’m stressed. I just feel like to be loved is to be known and I do that for him but he doesn’t do that for me.

I only have $500 until I get my first paycheck in the middle of July and I had to buy a bunch of tape, boxes, and bubble wrap for the glass furniture worth over $100. So not only am I spending money to move for this man, but I’m also spending the time to pack and he couldn’t even say a lousy thank you. I also left all my friends and family behind which makes it more annoying.

I quit smoking nicotine a few days ago and he blames it on my smoking withdrawals and I know that if I had a vape in each hand, I’d just think he’s still not very thoughtful and a little self-centered. I brought up the camera issue (the principle!) two days ago and I asked him if he got one this evening. He’s like “give me time”. He spends so much time on TikTok, and I just feel like the gift is honestly no longer special anyways. 

Anyways, I just don’t feel heard, acknowledged, or important to him and I’m wondering if I’m overreacting or does his ways need to be set straight? Thank you!

113,1d2p7by,AITA for not telling my girlfriend about how close my friend is with my ex-girlfriend?,"My girlfriend Caitlin and I commonly hang out with a couple Amy and Joe. Before I started dating Caitlin, I dated Molly and we would also hang out with Amy and Joe. Amy and Molly became good friends and would hang out without Joe or I being there. After Molly and I broke up I had no issues with Amy and Molly continuing to be good friends.

Fast forward a little over a year and I start dating Caitlin. At the beginning of my relationship with Caitlin before Caitlin had met Amy or Joe, we were talking about exes and I mentioned that my friends still hang out with my ex without detailing anything about the relationship beyond that. I forget the exact language that I used here, but I at a minimum conveyed that there was at least some form of relationship between them still. This has become a small point of contention, but either way I don't think it really matters.

Fast forward another few months and Caitlin and I are doing great and have hung out with Amy and Joe multiple times and we are all becomming good friends. One day before going to see them, Caitlin remembers what I said about having friends that still hang out with my ex and asked if it was Joe and Amy and I said yes. She had no big reaction in the moment and we went out to get dinner with them.

While at dinner Caitlin and Amy get pretty drunk and towards the end of the night Joe has already gone home and it's only Caitlin Amy and me in the car as I drive to drop off Amy at her house. Caitlin brings up the fact that I mentioned Amy still hangs out with my ex and Amy says that she does. Caitlin then asks Amy who she likes more, her or Molly. The vibe gets awkward and Amy gives a very diplomatic answer about how her and Molly are great friends but she still really likes Caitlin and thinks Caitlin and I are great together. We get to Amy's house soon after and Caitlin gets out of the car and gives her a hug I don't know what was said but it was a classic two drunk girls hugging it out.

The next morning I tell Caitlin that was weird and that she owes Amy an apology. She said she already apologised when she hugged her outside the car but texts her another apology.

Caitlin a little later tells me that she thinks I should have given her more details around the extent of Amy's relationship with Molly and that her not knowing what I knew about how close they were set her up for failure. Caitlin had previously let me know she is a jealous person and that is one of the things she is working on in therapy.

My boyfriend (25) and me (26) have been together for over 4 years and I feel unappreciated. For context, I am the sole cook and cleaner of our apartment. If anything, he takes out the garbage every once in a while. We split our bills down the middle. Over the weekend, I was cleaning up and I did all of the laundry and folded it. There was a shirt he wanted hung up, which he asked if I could and I said yes. Four full laundry loads later, and I forgot to hang it up. This morning, he asks me to choose an outfit for him for work and I do so. He decides he wants the shirt instead that he asked to hang up, and notices it wasn’t. He turns to me and in a disappointed voice and expression goes “you didn’t hang it up” where then I say, “well you can choose any of the other clothes that I washed and folded today and hang it up right now.” And he says, “you said you would hang it up and I asked you too.” And I tell him that he can do it himself if he wants it perfectly done. He didnt even thank me for doing his laundry, I only got this comment. So we start arguing and I blew up his phone this morning with saying how unappreciated I feel and how selfish he is acting. He refuses to thank me for what I do and is just saying “it’s the truth” and that comment shouldn’t upset me. So am I the asshole?

There was a shirt he wanted hung up, which he asked if I could and I said yes. Four full laundry loads later, and I forgot to hang it up. This morning, he asks me to choose an outfit for him for work and I do so. He decides he wants the shirt instead that he asked to hang up, and notices it wasn’t. He turns to me and in a disappointed voice and expression goes “you didn’t hang it up” where then I say, “well you can choose any of the other clothes that I washed and folded today and hang it up right now.” And he says, “you said you would hang it up and I asked you too.” And I tell him that he can do it himself if he wants it perfectly done. He didnt even thank me for doing his laundry, I only got this comment. So we start arguing and I blew up his phone this morning with saying how unappreciated I feel and how selfish he is acting. He refuses to thank me for what I do and is just saying “it’s the truth” and that comment shouldn’t upset me. So am I the asshole? 

Edit: for full context, I did call him names in texting him, like selfish, and to F off. ",0.0,0.07006913423538208,0,1
117,1d2oxs9,AITA for 'being mean' to a guy friend after he played with my feelings? ,"My friend group originally consisted of 3 girls, (2+me) who we'll call Jane and Mary. We were as close as college girls could be, constantly hanging out and telling each other everything, literally inseparable. Then this guy, we'll call him Dave, joins the group.

Dave doesn't really know how to treat women, and he's *really* flirty. I gave into the flirtiness, thinking we were just friends and who cares. But the flirtation coming from his side got to a point where I started to question, ""does he like me? Do I like him?"" And so I sat down with him and had a convo. During all of this, Mary seemed to be supportive and on my side ""no matter what happens."" I didn't pick up on any signs of jealousy. Then Dave said he only saw me as a friend and I was a little taken aback, not out of ego but out of ""how could you treat a woman like that and then not have any feelings?"" I got upset at him for feeling like he was a womanizer, and I don't really want to be friends with a womanizer.

A few months go by and Dave and I have had a rocky relationship. I just don't want to deal with him, and he seems to be avoiding me. One day I open up to Mary about something totally unrelated, talking about a really recent low point of my life. She completely brushes me off and tells me that I've hurt Dave's feelings and that I need to talk to him and stop being mean. For a week at most, I had been throwing some mean comments toward Dave, but at this point, it had been at least a month ago and I couldn't remember what I had even said. All I could remember was calling him a dickhead for ditching me and not telling me he wasn't going to show (basically ghosted me that morning until the group met up for lunch).

note that we're all in college, between the ages of 18 to 20

Dave and I talk, I express that I'm upset he went to the group, instead of talking to me. He says that I've been overly mean and he won't tolerate it any longer. I apologize despite not knowing what I said and take responsibility for getting mean when my feelings are hurt, then I ask why he went to the group, since he'd been deflecting the question. He says that he didn't go to them and that they brought it up to him. Suddenly, I'm torn between my girl friends, thinking they're talking about me behind my back.

Jane and I are close, and we're perfectly fine, but Jane is starting to view Mary as hypocritical and is hurt by her choosing a guy over us. And Mary has become attached at the hip with Dave, and I'm really broken up about it thinking I'm losing my friend. I also feel betrayed like how Jane does, as in, how could she be choosing him over me. It's been pretty clear to me through her actions that she has been picking sides and Jane even told me that Mary had been talking shit about me when I got close to Dave.

She has a tendency to be quite overbearing and rude. ""Mom why did you leave the coffee put on?""

Why did you do this she always says. Since the last few weeks she has not responded to any of my messages. 


Ive also seen this happen to me before with friends and my brother. Is it because im an asshole and not just telling them what they want to hear?

And even though I end conversations and leave him on read sometimes too still he throws more fillers in the conversation and re initiates... He has not really flirted too openly but I get the vibes, like asking me have I had dinner or asking me to pick me up etc etc

120,1d2omii,AITA for insisting my Aunt make me a partner since she needs me to run my deceased Uncle's business?,"I have worked for my Uncle's landscaping business for the past six years.  Quite sadly, we lost my Uncle this past January.  Since his passing, I have been running his business, as his wife (my biological Aunt) had no involvement with it or idea as to how it managed.  I'm the one talking to clients, managing the books, ensuring people are getting paid, etc.  Meanwhile, my Aunt is nowhere to be seen.

At the beginning of this month, I told my Aunt that I am running her business but really getting nothing in return for my effort.  I told her that I wanted to become a partner in the business.  I also feel that as the one doing all the work, I should deserve a larger stake, and so my suggestion was 65/35.  My Aunt already has a very good paying job, so this would just be passive income for her to enjoy while having to do absolutely nothing in return.

Naturally, she has refused.  She says I'm exploiting her situation, and feels I should respect my Uncle's wish that their son take over the business.  Meanwhile, their son is only fourteen and has expressed no interest in running the company at all.  Hell, he threw a tantrum at the suggestion of working a few weeks with me this summer to learn some of the ropes.

I did offer to teach my Aunt how to do the job, but because of her existing job, she declined.  And I have said that I will not train another person in the company to replace me, since obviously such an arrangement only harms me.

This past weekend, I told my Aunt that if she does agree to my terms then I plan to leave her company this coming July.  I have not told her this, but I am considering starting a competing company, and I know for a fact that several of her employees and clients would follow me.

Since laying out an ultimatum, my phone has been blowing up.  My Aunt has called me every name in the book, accused me of shitting on my Uncle's legacy, and has been very clear that she'd fire me if she could.  Other family members are also upset.  My grandparents have outright told me I'm exploiting the dead, and my mom feels I should leave my Aunt her company and just ask for a raise for my extra work.  Others have either remained neutral or suggested its probably best for me to leave and find other work and let her sort her own situation.

Him: You at home miss hot legs?

Me: Not if you put it that way

Him: lol don't be bashful

Me: Imagine some 87 year old lady insisted on talking to you that way.

  
He is a 62 year old man, I am a 37 year old woman. We have helped each other out a lot in the last year - he helps me with things like my lawnmower, and I am his I.T. wizard. But I'd pretty much decided to stop asking his help with things because he's been getting weirder and weirder about it. 

Last time with the lawn mower he showed up and insisted I eat some candy he brought for me before he would look at the mower. I refused because honestly....it was weird. Then he made me drive him in his car back to his house half a mile away to get a special screwdriver, and was mad when I didn't go inside to look for it with him.  

That day I offered to pay him, instead of cleaning his house or whatever like he wants. He knows I'm a single mom with a full time job and a very high maintenance old house, and I have told him over and over I would rather pay him, because I have more money than time. And he said ""I've never had a woman with money before."" To which I replied, ""You still don't."" So I've taken the mower to the shop instead of asking him for help again, and will continue to not ask him for help.

But I would still want to be friends with him if he weren't almost always either hitting on me or bitching about the government.  He doesn't talk to me like that around my son, and when I met his son, he introduced me as his adopted daughter. He thinks he is flattering me, telling me I'm beautiful and he's smitten with me and stuff but I have told him I am in no way attracted to him. Its just becoming more and more repulsive. Still, I think I hurt his feelings pointing out our age difference. I sent him another message a couple days later that said ""I hope we can be friends without you trying to talk to me like we are lovers, and I hope you're enjoying the beautiful weather"" and he is now ghosting me. So I guess the friendship is over, which I'm not that upset about even though I know almost no one else in the area. 

But I wonder if I owe him an apology for hurting his feelings.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for hurting my neighbor's feelings? The last text exchange went like this

124,1d2od6w,WIBTA if I ask my bf to distance himself from his female best friend,"My bf Josh (24m) and I (23f) have been dating for ~1yr. He has 2 best friends that he's known since high school: Mia and David.

Mia has said a number of things about me that I find rude. When Josh and I first started dating, he paid for all our dates. She made numerous comments about how he shouldn't do that, I should be paying because I make more than him, I'm a yellow flag because I didn't even do the ""fake-out"" pay. Josh and I have had multiple explicit conversations about this, and he has made it very clear he likes paying. Mia also said I must be cheap because I'm Chinese and was raised that way (she and Josh are viet) and that I rely on my parents financial support (I do not). She also said I might be anti-Palestine since I go to Starbucks occasionally (we have never discussed politics).

Now for the most recent comment that sparked this post. She lives out of state and was in back town for a bit, they decided on a time and place for them and some other friends to meet the night before. Josh didn't see the message until the day of the meetup. We'd just moved in and adopted a dog together in the week leading to the meetup, and we were furniture shopping that day and were running late. She had plans for most of the day and had a hard 1.5h of free time to meet, but we were 1h from the meeting spot and would've only had 30min to hang out even if we rushed. Because of this, he let her know we wouldn't be able to make it and maybe they could hang out tomorrow. She was very upset and later texted their group chat (them+David) saying that just because he and David are in relationships doesn't mean they can neglect their friends. She also screenshoted my ig story and said that Josh prioritizing me over her was like a slap in the face, and she was his best friend who he doesn't get to see much and to get his priorities straight. 

For context, we've hung out with her twice this year already, once when we flew to stay with her for 3 days, and again about 2 months ago. They also text in their gc daily and video call often. 

From my perspective, we were not only busy at the time, but the meetup was also last minute. He says she might be lonely as she lives far from most of her friends and because her 2 best friends are both in long term relationships while she is not. David said she needs to understand they have other priorities and should work on her neediness (his words). Josh has also talked to her about this and some previous issues but only after I asked him to. He is self admittedly very conflict avoidant so it's hard for him. 

I really don't want to be the gf that controls who he can talk to, especially since they're such good friends, but I'm tired. I'm tired of being insulted, but at the same time I'm not sure if I'm blowing these things out of proportion.

He has 2 best friends that he's known since high school: Mia and David.

Mia has said a number of things about me that I find rude. When Josh and I first started dating, he paid for all our dates. She made numerous comments about how he shouldn't do that, I should be paying because I make more than him, I'm a yellow flag because I didn't even do the ""fake-out"" pay. Josh and I have had multiple explicit conversations about this, and he has made it very clear he likes paying. Mia also said I must be cheap because I'm Chinese and was raised that way (she and Josh are viet) and that I rely on my parents financial support (I do not). She also said I might be anti-Palestine since I go to Starbucks occasionally (we have never discussed politics).

She lives out of state and was in back town for a bit, they decided on a time and place for them and some other friends to meet the night before.

126,1d2ny6x,AITA if I cancel my father’s birthday dinner?,"AITA For Not Inviting Stepmother & brother?

Let me preface this by stating that my sister and I are both adults with families of our own - both of us have non-biological kids (step kids) that we love very much and are very close to.  

Unfortunately, we have always had a bumpy relationship with our biological father, and things only got worse after our parents divorced many years ago.  He was verbally and emotionally abusive while he lived with us and afterward, he continued being this way until we chose to stop seeing him every other weekend.  After we became mothers ourselves, we tried to show him some grace and began trying to mend our relationship.  Our father remarried and had two sons who are now in their 20's.  We have the kind of relationship now where we call about once a month and visit a couple of times a year.  Conversations are light and nonconfrontational, never anything deep or of substance.  His sons are his pride and joy.  

He recently celebrated a milestone birthday with a party.  My sister and I were not invited and only found out on social media.  This has been the norm for the past 25 years.  His wife and sons are his ""real"" family while my sister and I are afterthoughts.  We have never told our father how we feel because he's older now and we don't want to upset him.  He would NEVER see our point either, in his mind he's been a wonderful parent to us.  We have just accepted things as-is while trying to connect with him regularly.  

Because this was a big birthday, we wanted to take him out ourselves for a nice meal.  He agreed and plans were made.  He later reached out to us and asked if his sons could come too.  My reaction was immediate and beyond angry.  My sister felt the same way.  We want to cancel everything and just say ""forget it"".  We used to meet up with him for coffee every few weeks and it was nice to be able to speak freely and have one-on-one time with him.  The last time we met up, he didn't ask, but said: ""Next time make these plans later in the day so your stepmother can come too"".  We never met for coffee again.  

There isn't enough time in the day for me to explain all of the nuances of our existing relationship, but he has always struggled to connect and communicate with girls (his daughters).  There is no conversation we can have that he doesn't shift to his sons and how amazing they are.  It's exhausting.  So, at this point, we don't want to take him out at all if it's going to be his sons and wife too.  Them being there removes the possibility of us having a real conversation with our father because his wife dominates all conversations she's in the vicinity of.    Please, tell me, AITA for wanting to say FORGET IT altogether???

*How could I forget to mention this?!  His sons didn’t know that we were their sisters until they were about 7-8 years old.  One of them asked us why we called his dad our dad.  Our father said that our stepmother didn’t want to confuse them.  She avoided us for about 3 months after that.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA if I cancel my father’s birthday dinner?

127,1d2ntqd,AITA for my neighbor's dog chasing me until it was hit by a car?,"This Sunday I was on a morning run, just finishing up back at my house when the dog from a neighbor's house just up the road started chasing through the middle of the road. I live on a fairly busy street where the speed limit is 45mph. It might sound unsafe to run on this road especially given it doesn't have a sidewalk and the shoulder is only about two feet wide but there's a side street with sidewalks and a lower speed limit only about 800 feet down the road so I usually just stay vigilant to the road at the beginning and end of each run. The dog's owner's house sat in this stretch of road.

Anyway, the dog chased me just about right up to my driveway where it got hit and run over by a van and ultimately killed. A series of unfortunate events only became worse for me when the dog's owner and his three small children came out hysterical that they had obviously lost their pet. Not to mention there were three MORE young children accompanying their parent in the van obviously distraught by what they'd just witnessed as well. The whole neighborhood came out to see what had happened where they come to find the dog's owner cussing me out for causing this disaster to happen.

I tried to calmly state that I didn't intend for the dog to chase me and that I've been running on this stretch of road each week but consoling the heartbroken family (and onlookers) was just about impossible at this point. After I realized there wasn't really anything I could do to improve the situation I told the owner that I lived here and would be happy to do anything I could to help the situation. I went home and after a few moments the situation appeared to have ended.

In hindsight it may not have been the best idea to tell them where I lived, but I didn't think anything bad would come of me because of the situation. I was on the opposite side of the road (facing oncoming traffic) from the house and I maintained my rate of speed and direction as I went by. I figure the dog should have been put on a leash if it had a history of sprinting off. As it turns out the owner of the dog is also the head of the Highway Department in my town and has a LOT of pull in the community. He's since gone on an angry tirade on the community Facebook page accusing me of causing the incident.

I still in no way think this is my fault but I have no idea how I'll convince the town I'm not at fault in the situation given the neighbor's influence in my small community. Moving is not really an option at this point as I live in the same town my elderly parents are where I spend a few days each week taking care of them. I'm just worried about going to the store and ending up in a confrontation without people being able to hear my side through. Please let me know if there was any way I could have handled this situation better.

I 29F just lost my grandmother 90F last week and her funeral was today. I didn't go, even though I loved my grandmother with all my heart; I couldn't go.

My car wasn't going to make the drive, I'm physically ill, and there was going to be a lot of people that I went NC with. Because of those people I had to severely reduce my contact with my grandmother just so she could have peace in the last years of her life. (If I could change it, I would.)

She didn't even get to meet my youngest son because of this that was born 2 months ago, that she was excited to meet. I may be the ah for not going because I know she would've wanted me there but I just couldn't have her funeral at an uproar.

I told him that I would loan him the money but that if his investment didn't pay off then he had to pay me back from his education fund.

130,1d2nk2f,AITA for telling my parents we aren’t giving them money and they need to humble themselves? ,"Throwaway to keep this separate from my normal account. 

I(38F) and my husband(41M) have been stressing over my parents. My parents are screwed as they took out of their pensions at 55 and have only about 100-130k each left. Their house has some equity but not as much as you would think as they have withdrawn from their equity line of credit several times. My dad has a 100k truck and a vintage Porsche and my mom has a 7 seater when they are the only ones now. My dad is very prideful and refuses to take anyone’s advice so it was a shock when they came to me and asked for money. He has had a lot of health issues and told me he is going to be taking social security now (he is 68) and quitting his job. Which means they cannot afford their mortgage or car payments. They totally blindsided me, I had no idea how bad it was until now. Thinking back I guess I should have known as they buy so much unnecessary crap but my parents always acted they were rich.

I told them point blank I wasn’t funding them until I could see all their accounts and assets and this caused a huge fight but they eventually relented. I went through what they have and they really don’t need my help. They just need to downsize dramatically. My husband is a CPA so he knows this stuff and we went though and told what they needed to do. They need to sell all the vehicles and get a reliable sedan. They need sell their 3400sqft home and buy into a single home with a basement suite or an apartment. I think the apartment is better as my dad struggles to mow the lawn and hires someone now anyway. But my mom insists she needs land for a garden. After that their ss payments would be enough and they would still have a small nest egg. 

This was met with them complaining that they would be living like prisoners. My parents were angry if they got a small single family they would need to rent out the basement. My dad insists the basement which he has as a man cave is necessary for life and my mom refuses to downsize as she has a whole room full of clothes at their current home that can’t fit in a smaller house. I got mad and told them they need to humble themselves since they are the ones asking for money. This resulted in them yelling how ungrateful I am over the phone until I hung up. 

I told them they have to do this because I’m not helping. They still have more assets than my husband and I and we have a son to save college funds for. My parents have been trying to guilt me by saying they gave me great Christmas presents and college fund so I owe them. I feel like that was a tiny proportion of their spending and it didn’t put them in this position but am I obligated to help support them when they can support themselves if they downside?

I feel like that was a tiny proportion of their spending and it didn’t put them in this position but am I obligated to help support them when they can support themselves if they downside?

131,1d2nk15,WIBTA for calling animal control,"I was in the front room and heard my wife yelling that something’s wrong with the chickens then she said there’s a dog out there harassing them (they are in a fenced run and dog was running around the outside chasing and barking). I was expecting a coyote and when I go out and there is little dog with yellow “safety” jacket on so clearly someone’s pet. I put on my best deep voice and yell “hey get outta here” and clap my hands really loud. The dog scurries toward the front yard and toward the road (about 150ft). I see a lady standing out on the opposite side of the road looking on and saying nothing. I say loudly, but not aggressively “you should keep your dog on a leash. He’s chasing our chickens.” To which she responded “sorry”. 

However it still bugs me because someone shouldn’t have to tell you that your dog should be on a leash in a state with leash laws and dog parks within a 10 min drive. It just seems common courtesy. Especially when the dog ends up out of your line of sight. So I was thinking to chat first with them - but I didn’t recognize her and never seen that dog being walked here nor anyone in our sleepy neighborhood ever walk their dog without a leash.

Note - we are in a neighborhood of 3-10 acre wooded lots and almost all homes have 50-100 feet minimum setback.

132,1d2nj3h,AITA For dropping baseball to focus on my studies against my mother's wishes?,"I (16M) am a student currently struggling with exams. 
I've also been playing baseball since I was 13 years old, something that my mother (55F) really enjoys since I spend most of my time inside not doing anything.

I'm not a really big fan of baseball, but I had some good friends and it was fun to play at first. Last year I started showing up to matches and being more social with everyone on my team, something which my mother really liked.

However, now that i've gotten older, the student life has been harder on me, and I've started skipping some trainings here and there have some extra studying time, something my mother is not entirely ok with but she lets me do it.

Around 5 months or so, we got a new coach. He isn't bad with us or anything, but ever since he started coaching us, i've been the benchwarmer. Now, I'm not saying I'm too good to be on the bench or anything, in fact I'm quite bad at baseball since i don't really care about the sport in general. But the thing that motivated me the most so keep playing was the idea that my team counted on me, and now that I was sitting on the bench only to be thrown on the spot where nothing happens instead of the position I was passionate about when I finally get to play has made me loose all interest in playing. 

I decided that I was going to drop baseball next year and look for something more enjoyable and flexible for me, but muy mother isn't happy at all with this decision.
She keeps telling me that ""I'm throwing away something good for me"" and that ""I liked it until just now"" among other things.

However, now that I've been struggling with finals, I've decided to stop showing up to anything baseball related since i needed more time and I didn't care about it, this has made my mother very angry and today she snapped and tried to force me to go to practice even though I told her I needed to do my math homework, she told me I was overreacting, that I had compromised with my team and that if I stop doing baseball I'll just be inside all day for the whole summer break. After a fight she left to go for a run and I've been thinking about it a lot.

I know she wants me to be healthy and active but I don't want to keep playing baseball, the more she pushes me into it the more I dislike the idea of continuing with baseball. 

I don't want to make her sad but I also want to do something I actually enjoy.

My boyfriend and I had initially said yes because my girl friend, let’s call her Emma, had a friend who lived downtown who offered up her apartment as a place to stay while we were on our trip. This was super convenient because it was close to a concert venue we planned on going to, a museum, a shopping center, the heart locket bridge, and other things we planned on doing. It was supposed to be a couples trip of sorts.

I planned the whole trip itinerary around this apartment being close to everything and also the fact that the apartment had amenities like a rooftop pool, a billiards room, and a bowling alley. Keyword, only I have been the one planning things out according to drive times, the fact that we were all taking one car, I wanted to make sure everyone felt accommodated since we were taking my car. I proposed a dinner with all four of us to discuss the details of my itinerary. Emma then tells me that another friend will be coming along with us, not on the drive but she would be accompanying us on our trip. 

I was annoyed but my boyfriend and I agreed because we didn’t want to piss anyone off. So instead of a couples trip, it turned into couples and an extra friend, which is fine but I told her that this friend would need to find her own transportation and lodging as to not interfere with the plans we had set. She agreed and everything was great.

It’s now 5 days before our trip and Emma tells me that her friend with the apartment no longer will be allowing us to stay there. I ask why and she says that this friend has been unreliable and talked bad behind her back before, but she thought she would come through for us. So now not only is there an extra person to consider in plans, but now we don’t even have a place to stay which messes with our itinerary tremendously. Hotels in the area are out of the question because check in times are so late, and air BnB is crazy expensive in downtown Austin.

135,1d2nej4,AITA for not disclosing my full income to prospective roommate?,"I am currently interviewing for a roommate. I live in NYC and looking at 3k-4k a month for 2-3 bedrooms. I wanted to secure a perspective roommate(s) first since housing is being snapped up within hours of a viewing. I also want to start the relationship on a good note for allowing their needs in housing to be taken into consideration- neighborhoods, train stops, elevator vs stairs and such. 

I recently interviewed with several individuals and one was a very good fit ( friend of a friend). This individual had another perspective roommate in mind and wanted us to meet. Let’s call her Jane. So we met for tea and went through the usual about me’s,  interests, needs and habits, and what amenities they were looking for. We also talked financials. With my previous interviews I requested financials they were ok sharing to confirm they were employed and had some move in costs saved up. However, Jane was upfront before we met she was not okay with this and would rather talk numbers. 

I was understanding and willing for just this meeting to talk instead. When we got to financials we talked -what her monthly budget is for housing/utilities, how much deposit/ move in costs saved and plans for emergency funds. After that the first secured roommate hyped her up for a few weeks and I thought okay let’s all three of us get together, get our paperwork together and start planning time for apartment walkthroughs. 

So we get together and talk through next steps. We all bring out our w2s, credit docs, letters from past landlords and we were like 15 minutes in talking when Jane asked me to clarify my budget. Which I did and her faced scrunched up and said well you can pay more. Am I am like what no this is the budget. So she starts using the calculator on the phone and says this is my take home pay monthly you can pay more. I felt this was rude and the friend of the friend also looked concerned. 

So I explained I had a loan that ate up over a third of my income. During the pandemic I experienced trouble paying bills -medical and dental expenses and deaths in my family. I ran up over 50k in credit card debt. I took a 401k loan to pay the largest cards cutting my debt down which took a third of my monthly pay-this loan actually gets paid off this summer. Jane was still not happy and said that she should not have to “subsidize other peoples lives” and that I have the money. We talked in circles for a bit and then she got up and left. 

The other roommate is still moving forward with me and was just as bewildered but said on paper it looks like I make more than them and that it is a legitimate question to ask. She also thought it looked like I was hiding something. At no point did we talk about how everyone is spending their money -only what they can spend on rent/utilites. 

If it’s my fault I will own it but I can not understand her thought process. I have a few more interviews coming up and I want to ensure I am being fair and upfront.

I got into the car with her a couple days after, and had the same head flick tic and she proceeded to mimic it again and said “sorry I have adhd and autism tics and I guess i’m just feeding off of you!”, the combination of my own insecurities surrounding my tics and just rage seeing someone that has never had this issue before doing because she thinks it’s funny or cute set me off. I yelled at her and told her that it’s not funny nor is it cute to mock someone and pretend like she has a disability that she has never been diagnosed with. she was very offended and said that just because a doctor won’t diagnose her doesn’t mean it isn’t real. it’s been a couple of days and she still tries to talk to me as if it never happened, and ever since I called her out I haven’t seen her have a single “tic”.

Eventually through facebook he comes to learn that my mother has taken it with her on accident. Dont ask me how she did that, I have no idea.   
""Mystery solved"" I think. I announce Im going back to bed, and shut the door, trying to subtly emphasis that I dont want to be disturbed.   
Again, I'm almost asleep when he opens the door again and says he's lost his keys.   
I feel crabbier again this time. I try to hide it but it doesnt work well. I look in the usual spots and he finds his keys by the friggin microwave of all places. He asks ""Are you mad"" and I state flatly ""I'm not mad, I'm just annoyed from being woken up twice."" He says sorry and goes to work.   
I'm wondering if I was in the wrong here and should apologize, since he DOES need his keys go to work and I shouldn't have been so bitchy about helping him.

We are having hamburgers and hot dogs and just hanging out with the family. It's nothing fancy. 

Steve asks, “Is this it?” when the first plate of hot dogs is done and waiting on the round of hamburgers. My wife says there will be hamburgers soon, and Steve tells my wife and sister about his family and how they have” BBQ chicken, steak, shrimp, and many options.” I picked up the plate of hotdogs and told Steve he could leave and go to his family BBQ instead. 

He just looked at me and drank his beer, and I told him and my sister to go since this wasn't good enough for Steve. I gave my sister store-brand photo chips back and told her to get out. 

My sister and Steve left, and the cookout was fine after that. My mom heard about me kicking them out and was mad at me and told me to apologize to my sister.

142,1d2mk70,AITA for telling my mom she isn't being understanding,"I (30F) got a 3 month old puppy a month ago . This is my first dog. I'm single and live alone, so I've been taking care of and training him by myself. Since it's a puppy he has crazy separation anxiety. I've been trying slowly get him used to being alone. On top of that I have a full-time job, a part-time job on Saturdays and I tutor a family friend, so I'm exhausted.

I live about 3 hours away from my mom and have always gone to visit at least monthly. I visited 2 weeks after getting the puppy on  
a saturday. Another family member got my dog's sibling and my mom was watching their puppy while they were at work. A few minutes before I arrived, a family member who works at an entertainment venue told me they had gotten tickets to an event I was interested in. When I arrived I let my mom know that I was supposed to be going to that event and had just found out I could go. Her reply was ""Y'all just assume that I can watch your dogs."" I realized I should've asked first. So, I asked her if she was okay with watching my dog for an hour and told her I could just stay, if she wasn't. She said it was fine, so I went to the event. My mom had a doctor's appointment that Tuesday and wasn't sure if she would have a ride. So, since I work from home, I stayed until Tuesday in case her ride fell through. She ended up having a ride, so after I finished working I headed back home.

I visited again the following weekend for Mother's day. I was working on getting my dog socialized by taking him out with me and I wanted to do a little shopping that Saturday, so I looked up dog-friendly stores and decided to go to a few. I know that my mom likes to go shopping with me, so I invited her to go. Her reply was ""You don't usually go to those stores. You're only going because of (my dog's name). I'm okay."" And on Mother's day my siblings and I spent the day with her.

During a recent phone call she made a comment about how I haven't tried to hang out with her one-on-one like I usually would. She then brought up how I made time to go that event for an hour, but haven't sat aside an hour for her. I mentioned that I asked her to come with me shopping and she said ""Those weren't stores that I like"" and I also mentioned that having a dog has been a huge adjustment and, honestly, a struggle for me, so of course I'm not operating exactly the same, but it's only been a month. She then said I could've asked one of my siblings to watch him so that we could hang out. I told her that I don't think she's being understanding. Her reply was ""Well, we're different because Ive been through worse things and if my mom was still around, I'd make time for her."" 

My mom is retired and doesn't drive, so I don't know if this is because she's feeling lonely or bored with her day-to-day life, but I've told her that I think that she should try out some hobbies or part-time work. I've even tried helping her narrow down hobbies to do with no success.

The wedding planning started in March 2023 and the wedding is set for June 2024. Tammy and I helped Cami with everything. We helped decide on a venue. We picked out the wedding dress that she said yes to. And if it wasn't for me and Tammy setting them up on a date they wouldn't be getting married this summer.

Now with everything starting last year our friend Cami decided to have a bachelorette party in Tennessee in July 2023 for a week. We all live in Texas. Both Tammy and i couldn't make it. Due to limited vacation time for our jobs. Being away from our kids. And the financial aspect we informed Cami that we couldn't make it to Tennessee. We asked if we could have a get together here in Texas for a night. It would save money and vacation time.

Cami agreed. So her and the other bridesmaids went to Tennessee and what looked like a blast. We welcomed her back and expected her to be ready for our party here. She never got back with us on a date. But has posted of other bachelorette parties from her job. From her in-laws on both sides. From her family. etc. Cami has ghosted us from the whole event since then. We have tried reaching out to her and she hasn't answered. Cami has a history of just ghosting us for nothing before and just makes up that she was too busy and never saw our messages. But a whole year later. This is low. She hasn't said anything. So we haven't been told we cant come. But we are pretty certain we aren't bridesmaids anymore.

145,1d2m49i,AITA for telling my dad he can't bring his girlfriend to my graduation?,"Hi!  
I'm sorry if this feels too unorganized, and I apologise for any spelling or grammatical errors. English is not my first language.

I (F21) graduating from university in just a few days. My parents are the only ones invited to the actual graduation ceremony due to me graduating on a week day and due to limited capacity at the ceremony. Once the graduation ceremony is finished, I had planned on going to a café with my parents to celebrate my graduation, which is a tradition that we have done every year since I started school in 2008.

Some background. My parents got divorced when I was 15, and my dad currently has a new girlfriend who he has been dating for 3 years. Me and her don't get along very well, which is largely due to her trying to intervene every time I ask my dad for something. One example of this is that whenever I am spending time with my dad and she knows about it she will call him several times to ask for things that easily could be a text. Every Christmas I also have to keep the fact that I received a Christmas present from my dad a secret because she thinks that they shouldn't buy Christmas presents for the kids who don't live at home. However, she does not stick to this when it is about her own kids. If she asks who I got the Christmas present from, I have to say it was from my mother. My dad actually keeps it a secret from her sometimes that he is spending time with me which I actually find pretty hurtful. 

So, the graduation.... ONLY my parents are invited, not even my older half-siblings or any grandparents are invited. I thought I had made it clear that I wanted it this way by just asking my dad to be there and never asking his girlfriend to be there as well. But two days ago, my dad called me and told me that after the graduation ceremony, he would go and pick up his girlfriend and bring her to the café. I was kind of stunned at the moment and just said okay. I knew right away that I didn't want her there because I wanted to just have my parents for myself that day and not feel like I had to walk on eggshells. I just want the day to be about me and my family and I honestly don't consider her to be my family. I also find it extremely awkward for my dad's girlfriend to be there when it's only me and my parents present. I got the courage yesterday to finally tell my dad that I wanted it to be just him, my mom and I. I instead suggested that we book a table at a restaurant for the weekend instead to celebrate. When I told him that, I noticed that he seemed a bit frustrated, and I was just getting the feeling that he would do something to force his will on me.

146,1d2m0zj,AITA for telling my roommate I don't want to live with her anymore?,"For many months now I've been living with my roommate I considered one of my best friends. Before we moved in together, I agreed I would help her with things as she needed it, like some financial help until she got a job and providing rides sometimes since she doesn't have a car.

Now we find ourselves in conflict a lot because of different lifestyles. The whole apartment is frequently dirty as she leaves dirty dishes, unfinished food and drinks, clothes, and mtg cards everywhere. She says she can't clean up because her depression makes it too hard and she's too tired after working 20 hours a week. I know she has depression so I try to understand, but whenever I ask her to do things she gets mad and insults me before saying she can't.

Our lease expires in two months, so I told her I don't want to live with her anymore and she told me I'm selfish because she can't support herself. I offered to pay to move her back in with her dad, but she said she doesn't want this because her mom is very mean to her.

She says I should just support her because I have a job that pays decently well, but I'm so tired of the dirty apartment and frequent fights that I feel are often very meanspirited.

For many months now I've been living with my roommate I considered one of my best friends. Before we moved in together, I agreed I would help her with things as she needed it, like some financial help until she got a job and providing rides sometimes since she doesn't have a car.

Now we find ourselves in conflict a lot because of different lifestyles. The whole apartment is frequently dirty as she leaves dirty dishes, unfinished food and drinks, clothes, and mtg cards everywhere. She says she can't clean up because her depression makes it too hard and she's too tired after working 20 hours a week. I know she has depression so I try to understand, but whenever I ask her to do things she gets mad and insults me before saying she can't.

Our lease expires in two months, so I told her I don't want to live with her anymore and she told me I'm selfish because she can't support herself. I offered to pay to move her back in with her dad, but she said she doesn't want this because her mom is very mean to her.

She says I should just support her because I have a job that pays decently well, but I'm so tired of the dirty apartment and frequent fights that I feel are often very meanspirited.

She was extremely down on her luck and losing her place to live so I offered she live at my house (that I own) to get back on her feet. Get a job, save up, and move out. That was the idea. At the time, I said ""until April.""

It's two days from June.

She doesn't have any furniture so she sleeps in my bed or on my couch. She doesn't have a car or driver's license.  She drinks every day, to the point where she gets slurred speech and insults me. She doesn't work at all or have any social life; she has only left the house once in the entire time I have lived here and it was with me. It's a small 3-bedroom house that is just over 1000 square feet so I feel like I have no space.  
She has been giving me some money (from her unemployment money) to cover her added expenses (I charged her $200 at first but I've since increased it to $750 because my water bill and electric bill are outrageous, she has since demanded that I reduce that amount because she can't afford it) but in March I asked her to find another place.

148,1d2lnbx,AITA for not looking after my friends dog when he went on holiday?,"My friend of over 10 years has a dog I often look after when he goes on holidays with his husband. This year, they planned a three-week trip with no confirmed dates and asked if I would be around and I said yes. Some months later my boyfriend, whom I live with, let me know that his mom and her husband wanted to visit but turned out it was during their trip.

For context, his dog is anxious, barks, and almost bites when approached a certain way, especially when there are more people in the house. She bit me once and almost bit a friend staying over this year. I live in a one-bedroom apartment, so visitors sleep in the living room with the dog. As it was my mother in law's first visit, I informed my friend I couldn't look after the dog during those days and suggested other pet-sitting options I found on-line. He didn't reply.

A couple of weeks later, he said his husband's brother David would stay at their flat and look after her but asked if David could bring her to me once my mother in law left. I agreed.

A week before their trip, my friend asked if I could stay with his dog the first week before my mother in law arrived. David would then pick the dog up, look after her while my mother in law was here, and then bring his dog back to me once she left. David is unreliable, having once promised to look after the dog but never showed up, so I was certain he wouldn't pick her up, leaving me with her for all three weeks. My friend said it would be expensive for David to take public transport from their house to work. I said I preferred to keep our original agreement due to the reasons mentioned. He was passive-aggressive, asking if it was too much work to look after her. I got upset. I had looked after her for free before without complaining, at least twice per year for the past three years. I explained it wasn't easy to look after a dog, that I take her out twice a day for walks+pee+poo but I didn't mind doing it. However, this time I didn't want a dog around with visitors I wasn't close with, risking her getting stressed and barking all the time. He didn't like my response and commented that he and his husband were not my priority anymore. He said if it was too much work, he would find other alternatives. I said I didn't see the need for an argument and would still look after her on the days I had promised, asking only to keep the agreement.

He didn't reply. He didn't talk to me until the day I was supposed to look after her because I texted saying mother in law was leaving the next day and David could bring her here. He replied it wasn't needed, that David was staying at their flat until they came back. He hasn't talked to me since, and it's been days since they are back.

149,1d2llzj,AITA for texting my friend’s boyfriend telling him that he ruined my bachelorette party?,"I’m getting married in the fall and got back from my bachelorette party yesterday. There were 10 girls plus 1 guy who is gay. We went to an Airbnb in a major American city on the ocean and spent our time relaxing by the water and on a boat. We went out clubbing once but that was it. 

One of my best friends since highschool “Lindsay” has been dating “Rob” for 2 years. About a year and a half ago, Rob converted to Islam. This has caused a strain in their relationship because he has grown increasingly controlling and judgmental since this. I love Lindsay but she’s always been insecure and lets guys walk all over her. I guess she had to beg Rob to “allow” her to even go on this trip. Rob is VERY against alcohol and general party scenes. 

Here is some of what we dealt with. I felt HORRIBLE for Lindsay during all of this. I would say like clockwork he called her every 90 minutes to 2 hours. There were multiple times she stepped out of whatever we were doing to talk to Rob on the phone for half an hour. She avoided being in group pics for the most part. We took one of all of us on the boat and she freaked out to the whole group to please not post it anywhere because Rob would freak out knowing she wore a two piece without him there. 

I did snoop on her phone, which I regret, when she left it out and it was blowing up with texts from Rob. I saw the horrible disgusting things rob was saying. I posted a pic of me and 2 other bridesmaids on the boat and we happened to be in bikinis because boat. He screenshotted it and sent it to Lindsay basically calling us whores, sluts, fat, drunks, saying he’s disgusted by who Lindsay surrounds herself with. He said she is going to embarrass him in front of his religious community too. He said if anything bad happened to any of us it would be our own faults because we are drunk sluts. He insulted MY fiancé. Apparently my fiance is not a man because he lets me wear bikinis and drink alcohol. He also had quite a bit to say about our gay friend as well. Ending with alluding that he should be un-alive

When we got back, I texted him a very long message about what I thought of his actions. I said ruined the weekend because of how he tried to control Lindsay the whole time. I could tell her off she was all weekend because he was saying horrible things to her. He apologized to me but did say he cannot help that the way we choose to live is against his religion and can’t stand to see the woman he loves “delve in sin” and said that he tried to tell her she shouldn’t go. I insulted him and his perceived manhood. Im not going to go into much more detail here due to CC but I went off. Lindsay has told me that I should have let her handle it and now things are so much worse for her. He’s saying things like she needs to cut all of us out, especially me for disrespecting him. Aita?

Eventually I made a wrong turn at an intersection so I asked him to stop talking at the next one so I could hear the phone. He didn't stop and kept asking me why I was asking him to stop. I explained and yet he kept talking and insisting that there's no reason for him to stop talking. I lost my patience and told him to ""shut the fuck up"". I know it's very rude but I was driving and needed to focus. 

Later at night, he interrupted by blocking my view of the road with his hands twice (as a fun prank), after which I pulled the car over in the emergency lane and told him that if he does it again we're not going to be friends. 

In my opinion, roads are a dangerous place, especially for pedestrians and animals so it's important for a driver to have a view of the road at all times. And him blocking the road not only put our lives at risk but also anyone who could have been on the road. 

We talked about it later. It seems that his risk perception of driving is not as high as mine and I'm wondering if I'm the one who is paranoid about roads and being an asshole unnecessarily?

153,1d2kjhq,AITA for limiting the number of souvenirs I’m making for my bfs sisters wedding,"AITA for setting a limit for the number of souvenirs I would make for my bfs sisters wedding  


I have been with my bf for almost 8 years, fast forward to my bfs nephews christening. My bfs brother and sister in law got me and my bf as godparents to their second child. And they had this whole party and everything. I had thought of getting gifts but realized I don’t think they had a souvenir or any sort of party favor for their party and I offered to make some personalized scented soy wax candles for the event. I make candles sometimes because it’s kind of my hobby/side hustle. I don’t make cheap ones that’s for sure. I use premium high quality materials and they end up costing close to $6 each. And I made around 55pcs for the christening, all for free of course.

Following the next few days, my bfs sister gave me a bunch of compliments on how well the candles turned out etc and ultimately mentioned it was her dream to have candles as the wedding favor or souvenir at her wedding. I told her that yeah it would be nice to have candles in a wedding but she ended up asking me anyways if I could be the one to make the candles for her wedding like how I did with my bfs nephews christening. Ultimately signaling she’s asking for this for free. 

I said maybe to her. But she already took that as a yes. So I was like ok well suck it up buttercup. I knew she was having 100 guests so I knew it was gonna be 100 candles. In the next few weeks I asked her what she wanted and the scent the jar the design etc. lo and behold she starts messaging me these requests like the kind of jar (a much more expensive kind) she wanted 4 different scents (this is a bit hassle in my part to make different scented ones) and to top it all off she wanted 200pcs of 200g candles. So I’m already computing on my mind and what she wanted was gonna cost over $1200 at least. In my mind the $600 would be some sort of wedding gift already from me and my bf to her. But $1200 is a huge huge amount. I feel like it’s too much. I don’t even make that much in a month at my job. 

I told my bf the situation and he said he will talk to her and offer that we only give 100 candles as our gift to her. On my part I’m just so surprised that she would even ask for 200pcs? She’s not having 200 guests she’s only having about 100-120. So I don’t understand it. It really makes me question if she’s taking advantage of my generosity. And she knows we aren’t close at all and that she has never made an effort to be closer to me for the 8 years I’ve been with my bf. Isn’t it already a bit crazy on her part to ask me to do this for her when we’re not even that close and I know she never liked me and she had the gall to ask for 200pcs among other requests?

Anyway I haven’t even replied to her until now. I seen her message but I didn’t reply because what the hell am I even supposed to say.

But $1200 is a huge huge amount. I feel like it’s too much. I don’t even make that much in a month at my job. 

I told my bf the situation and he said he will talk to her and offer that we only give 100 candles as our gift to her. On my part I’m just so surprised that she would even ask for 200pcs? She’s not having 200 guests she’s only having about 100-120. So I don’t understand it. It really makes me question if she’s taking advantage of my generosity. And she knows we aren’t close at all and that she has never made an effort to be closer to me for the 8 years I’ve been with my bf. Isn’t it already a bit crazy on her part to ask me to do this for her when we’re not even that close and I know she never liked me and she had the gall to ask for 200pcs among other requests?

Anyway I haven’t even replied to her until now. I seen her message but I didn’t reply because what the hell am I even supposed to say. ",0.0,0.02377466857433319,0,1

155,1d2kgo2,AITA for telling my mother and my younger brother that having more kids is abusive to his current kids ,"My brother Teagan (29 M) has 4 kids (8,5,4,2) with his ex-Rachel (27F) my brother is military and was cheated on by Rachel while he was deployed. She married this man Ronald (27M) last year. During the divorce, Teagan met Susanna (28F) she has 3 kids with her ex husband, one with my brother and is now expecting a second child. If you have lost count, that would be 9 kids (with their baby on the way) in total between Teagan and Susanna. 

Recently due to drama I have gone no contact with Teagan after he announced his engagement to Susanna. (She has multiple monetary judgments against her, and lied about being married whilst dating and having a baby with Teagan) 

Teagan has a contempt order out for back child support, makes minimum wage, has almost been evicted multiple times and is in violation of his divorce decree because he can’t keep insurance on the 4 kids he has with Rachel… he has a long legal road ahead of him. 

My mother Kristy came down to my home recently and over a lunch shared that my brother was expecting again…I told her that I felt as if this was child abuse for him to have another kid. Purely because of the fact that he couldn’t afford to clothe, have insurance on or feed the ones he has. 

My mom has told me multiple times that she has bought formula, milk and groceries for him, and he has allowed the children to just eat ramen or has sent them to my moms house to procure food. 

Needless to say she got upset at me and now won’t talk to me, she has also told Teagan and he’s calling and leaving me angry voicemails.

I just thought I was stating my opinion, and I gave a lengthy reason as to why I felt that way, we grew up poor, and mom and dad were never present; and were both abusive because they both had severe PTSD… I had to raise my brother.

I only decided to put myself up for election pretty much last-minute, but she had apparently submitted her application a few weeks earlier already. She didn’t tell me about it, said she wanted it to be a surprise, I only knew because another friend of us told me. 
When the candidates for the elections were announced, all of us were a bit surprised- we had heard that this year, the student council had had some problems finding new members, so we hadn’t thought there would be any real competition getting in. Well, turns out that there were 25 candidates, but only 20 seats available, so there’d be some competition to get in after all.

In the few weeks before the election, I, of course, asked people to vote for me. (Please note that I didn’t go around campus and asked every person I saw for their vote, I only talked to my friends and some people from my university courses and told them that I was up for election and that if they hadn’t decided who to vote for yet, I’d be happy about their vote.) I have to admit that I know that my friend is a bit introverted, whereas I am more extroverted and probably know a few people more than she does.

Well, come election day, and I had quite a few votes. Not an impossibly high number, but enough to get me into the student council. She, on the other hand, only got a handful of votes, so that she wasn’t able to join the council. 

Now she’s angry at me for not telling people to vote for her as well. I didn’t think it was my responsibility to do so. If I hadn’t been up for elections, or if there hadn’t been any real competition, I would of course have asked people to do so!

Dad is my bio dad. Mom is my adoptive mom. She and my dad met when I was only a baby and she adopted me when I was 18 months old. The woman who gave birth to me didn't want me and dad was alone with me until he met mom. I never had a relationship with my birth giver and I never considered her my mother or one of my moms. I have one mom and she's all I ever needed in a mom.

My dad met his wife when I was 6, she moved in with him when I was 7 and they got married when I was 8. I never liked her. She tried to be close to me but she did so by also being dismissive of my mom. She made it sound like I should discard mom and let her (dad's wife) be my new mom since neither were bio related to me. She told me it was better for kids to have their parents together and I couldn't be too attached to my mom given she didn't give birth to me or breastfeed me. I was always cold and distant with my dad's wife. I can be civil but I never let her in and I never considered her a part of my family. I merely tolerate her existence and her presence. She never stopped trying to get her own place in my life as a mom but it never happened. She's not my mom and if my dad died tomorrow or she and dad divorced, I would cut her from my life so fast her head would spin. I have never hid the fact I feel this way either. I have also called her out before for minimizing my mom's role in my life.

As an adult I don't see her very often which works great for me. But now I'm getting married and she decided she's going to try and be one of the ""mom's of the groom"". I told her it wasn't happening and then she flipped when she found out my mom and I were doing a mother/son dance. She insisted I needed to dance with the two moms who would be at my wedding. I told her I was dancing with my only mom. She argued that I have three and two of them raised me and those two should be treated equally since one isn't more to me than the other. My very strong reply was that there are no other mom's and my mom has been my one and only mom raising me since I was 6 months old and that her attitude about my mom is exactly why she was never considered ""one of the moms"" or a mother figure at all. I told her she had not earned and was not deserving a dance and to get the fuck over herself.

It seems this is the first time she realized I don't love or care about her at all. And she cried to my dad. Both of them think I was cruel and needlessly harsh when all she ever did was try to love me.

My sons and DILs wedding is at the end of the June. Originally they were tight on money and were upset over the price of flowers. It wasn’t in their budget and they had a very specific image. I looked at prices for what they wanted and it was out of my own budget.

I instead offered to do what they wanted with fake flowers. They agreed and sent over images for me to use. I have spent over 500 buying all the stuff and my own time. They turned out great in my opinion. 

I got a call about two week ago, that they won’t need them anymore and that they have the money to have real flowers. That they already booked it. So in short all my time was for nothing.

My daughter was over and commented how cute the flowers were. She asked if I could make her some for her baby shower. I explained what happened and told her she can have them.

Her baby shower was over the weekend and she used the flowers on the tables. It was a nice event. After my son and DIL came up and we got into an arguement. They think I am a jerk for using their flowers for someone else’s event and now everyone will think they copied my daughter for their wedding.

My point was I can give them away to whoever and I don’t think it is a big deal since they were used. That instead of me throwing them out, someone got to use them.

When 46y old he suffered a severe stroke that affected his speech and left his right side of his body paralyzed. This was a huge blow to the family. I was 6 yrs old. My grandmother took care of me so that my mother could work and help my uncle. Once my uncle's condition improved he bought a car and tried to return to his former life. However, in his former life, he'd been an alcoholic who frequently caused problems for those around him. He had even k*lled someone while driving drunk with my grandmother and mother as a child in the back seat.
My mother was always the dependable one, taking care of everyone, while my uncle was seen as the poor son who needed help. This perspective, particularly from my grandmother, placed all the burden on my mother’s shoulders.
Years passed, my grandparents died, and now my uncle is 73. He still cannot speak and remains half-paralyzed, but he is self-reliant. He can cook, clean his apartment, drive, and maintain a social life. However, he needs help with his numerous health problems that require long hospital stays and he often causes trouble due to his character. As grandma was growing older my mother needed more help and tried to share the load with me involving me in doctor visits, bureaucratic tasks or keeping her company during his hospitalizations.
During my teenage yrs she became increasingly frustrated and impatient with me. When I went to university grandmother died, and my mother developed anger, and depression. She felt abandoned to care for her half-crazy half-paralyzed brother with no daughter, parents or partner. I was also dealing with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, an eating disorder, and struggling to get my degree.
After I graduated, my mother insisted I return to our hometown. I moved back and we lived together because I couldn’t afford my own place. I was 25 working random jobs for 15 hrs a day.Our fights continued, mainly about money and living together. My mother started having panic attacks. My uncle’s situation was stable but we were miserable.
I eventually found a good job in my field in another country and decided to leave.
It's been 5 yrs now.I have a happy life. Because of my job, we can go on big trips with my mother. I visit her every 2-3 months and stay with her for 30 days each time. Despite this, we still fight, and she sometimes blames me for her misery because I left. She wants me to return but I don’t want to. I feel incredibly guilty. If I return, neither my boyfriend nor I would be able to get well-paying jobs. I’ve told her she can come live with me when the time comes, but she doesn’t want to leave her country & she can’t move far as long as my uncle is alive.

He had even k*lled someone while driving drunk with my grandmother and mother as a child in the back seat.
My mother was always the dependable one, taking care of everyone, while my uncle was seen as the poor son who needed help. This perspective, particularly from my grandmother, placed all the burden on my mother’s shoulders.
Years passed, my grandparents died, and now my uncle is 73. He still cannot speak and remains half-paralyzed, but he is self-reliant. He can cook, clean his apartment, drive, and maintain a social life. However, he needs help with his numerous health problems that require long hospital stays and he often causes trouble due to his character. As grandma was growing older my mother needed more help and tried to share the load with me involving me in doctor visits, bureaucratic tasks or keeping her company during his hospitalizations.
During my teenage yrs she became increasingly frustrated and impatient with me. When I went to university grandmother died, and my mother developed anger, and depression. She felt abandoned to care for her half-crazy half-paralyzed brother with no daughter, parents or partner. I was also dealing with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, an eating disorder, and struggling to get my degree.
After I graduated, my mother insisted I return to our hometown. I moved back and we lived together because I couldn’t afford my own place. I was 25 working random jobs for 15 hrs a day.Our fights continued, mainly about money and living together. My mother started having panic attacks. My uncle’s situation was stable but we were miserable.
I eventually found a good job in my field in another country and decided to leave.
It's been 5 yrs now.I have a happy life. Because of my job, we can go on big trips with my mother. I visit her every 2-3 months and stay with her for 30 days each time. Despite this, we still fight, and she sometimes blames me for her misery because I left. She wants me to return but I don’t want to. I feel incredibly guilty. If I return, neither my boyfriend nor I would be able to get well-paying jobs. I’ve told her she can come live with me when the time comes, but she doesn’t want to leave her country & she can’t move far as long as my uncle is alive.

We have been close friends for 5 years and hang out at least twice a week. Alice introduced me to my girlfriend and the three of us spend a lot of time together. Basically we are close to the point we can talk about more 'personal' stuff without it being weird

Alice has really 'bad' skin. It varies but generally there's a few big acne patches on her face and upper arms and back, with at least a few big pimples thrown in. I've seen her extensive skincare routine (she tries different things but nothing seems to work)

She doesn't appreciate advice on it. I suggested she might be using too many products as I saw advice online about letting skin 'breathe' and she snapped and told me that 1) she was working with a doctor, 2) she tried that, and 3) she would not take skincare advice from a guy with no spots whose skincare routine is bodywash in the shower and... yeah fair enough

Last week I went to a party with my new work friends and I invited Alice to meet them. Alice was pretty 'off' the whole evening but I couldn't work out why (a bit shyer than usual, drinking a little more), she was also having a bad skin day. At one point she ran off to the bathroom and stayed there for about 15 minutes

When she came back she got side glances from people and it was pretty clear why. Her face was considerably more red, with discernible nail marks around her spots. Several of the larger pimples were clearly... exhumed. No gunk on her face, but the redness and small spots of blood were obvious

I took her aside and let her know, and that she should splash some cold water or something and cool her skin as it had gotten very red, that people were staring. I also said it felt weird and embarrassing for me to bring a friend to a social event and then have to deal with them being like this, these are new colleagues and only know her through me and I don't want to be associated with something a lot of people think is gross (the picking at a party, not the acne)

She got really quiet and left soon after, and I stayed with my friends and gf and had a nice evening. Now it's a week later and Alice told my girlfriend who is now mad at me, and so is Alice, for apparently embarrassing her when in my opinion she did that to herself.

Alice brought up that she has said she doesn't want skincare advice but I think this is different. My gf says it wasn't my place to say anything but I meant well so I don't think I'm an asshole, tbh I think it was selfish of her to do that in the first place, AITA?",Asshole,2024-05-28,"AITA for telling my friend it was really obvious she had been popping her acne and that she shouldn't do it at parties 'Alice' and I are both 26.

164,1d2j31a,AITA for refusing to let my fiance visit my parents living in China?,"Throwaway account

I (25F) am Chinese and my fiance (25M) is Vietnamese. I was born in China, and spent my days there, but eventually, after a lot of arguments and trying to convince my parents to let me move to Australia by my first year of university, they relented, which I was ecstatic over.

When I was in high school, I kept studying hard, especially english, because I had a dream of moving to Australia. After taking the Gaokao in my final year (the Chinese equivalent of the SAT), as well as showing evidence of my proficiency in English and all the processes that went into successfully becoming an international student, I finally managed to land my dream degree of a bachelor's in biomedical engineering.

The main reason I wanted to move to Australia was when I had realised that my family were pro CCP. I was getting disconnected from my family because of the enforcement of their beliefs onto me and my brother. The last straw came was when my brother told me that he was going to voluntarily serve in the Chinese Military.

When I was in the middle of my second year of university, I met my boyfriend, now fiance, for the very first time and we met through the esports club in our university. As we got to know each other even further, romantic feelings began to appear and we began to date after I asked him out. When we had both finished our degrees, he proposed to me, which I ecstatically said yes.

We were now engaged and we were discussing about our future wedding and other marriage related things. The issue arose when my boyfriend told his parents that he was engaged and started asking me about wanting to meet my parents, to which I firmly refused. When he asked why, I explained the reasons why I moved to Australia in the first place and told him everything about my parents and said I didn't wnat to be dishonoured (They're also quite racist to non Chinese people).

A while after that talk though, my fiance asked about any possibility of meeting my parents. He'd rather have me rip the bandaid off and be completely honest with my parents that I was dating him. In his words, he'd much rather get hurt by my parents rather than let me carry on my ""secret dating"". He also added that since my family was so far away, they couldn't cause any immediate harm or danger to me or him.

In the end, I was still adamant with my decision, but as I was writing this post, I keep thinking about my parents and the things my fiance said. Even though they were bad parents, I cannot help but think that maybe I should just be honest with them, because there's easy solutions if they disapproved. Moreover, I can live a transparent life and even with the hurt, my fiance can help me with the pain. I can't stop thinking about family and cultural values and concealing something so big as this. I'm especially second guessing myself because I was being so paranoid over this, when I was someone who managed to move to the other side of the world by myself and am doing fine.

165,1d2ixo7,"AITA for blowing up at my grandparents, when they said it wasn’t worth saving a cat and her kittens?","I’ve been thinking about this for a while. Sorry for any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language!

I (18nb) was at my MIL’s house with my Bf (20m) this weekend, housesitting. My MIL feeds some stray cats here (one is called Fatface). When I went to feed Fatface, I saw another cat with him, an orange cat. My boyfriend told me she was a female and came around often. She looked very skinny and possibly pregnant, so I felt bad and named her Amber.
I debated going outside, fearing I might scare her, but she ran up to me craving attention. I asked my Bf if she had a home, and he said she didn’t, as many strays comes from a neighbor's barn. I wanted to keep her, but I live with my grandparents who refuse to get another cat (I already have a 13-year-old female cat). I asked my mom for advice, and she suggested talking to someone she knew. We discovered Amber had already given birth, so I should look for her kittens before taking Amber. They agreed to pick her up the next day.
I found the kittens in my MIL’s greenhouse but couldn’t find Amber until the next day. After driving my boyfriend to a bus stop, because he had to go home. I went back to find Amber. When I tried to reunite her with the kittens, they acted like they weren’t hers, and we realized they weren't. My mom's contact agreed to take Amber and the kittens while I kept looking for the real mother, whom I later named Ellie. Ellie was terrified, but we eventually got her to her kittens and confirmed she was the mother, so I had to return Amber, to find her kittens.
When my mom dropped me off at my grandparents' house, I asked which car I could use to drive Amber back. My grandma was irritated and my grandpa laughed, saying it was ""sick the length I went to for this one cat"" and ""it's just nature."" Tired and losing sleep, I lost my cool and shouted, ""you only think of yourself."" My mom told me to calm down and asked what’s up. I shouted towards my grandpa, ""oh nothing, they just don’t think about anyone or anything else but themselves, they’re so fucking egoistic!"" Then I drove off with Amber.
I ended up talking to my mom all the way to the house. I told her I felt one of my biggest purposes in life is helping animals and giving them a voice, which my grandparents didn’t care about. Things are still tense when my grandma mentions the cat. They believe it's just how nature goes, but here cats overproduce. Amber was very skinny, and Ellie, only about 7 months old, and kittens were around 9 weeks old, so she was around 4-5 months when giving birth. 
Did I do the right thing? I know I probably should have communicated better, but something just set me off. AITA?

Edit: The person my mom knew is a rescue worker who gets cats neutered and vet-checked. She thought it was best to take Amber and the kittens, especially since Amber might be pregnant again. We don’t know if Amber's condition is due to pregnancy, worms, or if her stomach hasn't gone back to normal.

There was one artist though that i had made friends with a week previously. He was a friend of a friend and said if im a paintr i should enter in the competition. I told him my anxiety about it but it seemed like fun so i applied and got in last minute. He talked alot about himself and how to be good at stuff. But i was still thankful for the advice he gave as it was my first time in the competition so i thought he was being nice but now not sure. He lost the first round. And i made it to the finals and won. After winning and making all these freinds i wanted to not only do a post about my artwork as i hate bragging about myself because my inner critic.

Im not sure what he meant as i kept saying how great the experience was and that i was really grateful for it? Is he salty he lost first round? Did i offend him somehow? Or was he being manipulative making me feel more bad than i already did (thank you critical self intrusive thoughts) and wanted me to drop out of finals? Also i should note i didnt vent or anything to him ever. I only mentioned i was anxious once and thanked him for his advice and recommendations on getting out there as an artist.

I understood this and told her that I'd still be going. She asked where I was staying and I told her. She got annoyed at this and told me I should be staying in a hotel.

I mentioned that this will save me money and that there's no reason to waste money on a hotel when I can stay somewhere for free. She just said I shouldn't be staying with other women.

169,1d2iulb,WIBTA for wanting my partner and their mom clean up before I move in?,"My (20F) partner (20X) and I both attend college out of state from where we're originally from, but we used to live in very different areas (myself from LA, my partner from Chicago). We're likely moving back to Chicago together after college for a number of reasons, but the main one is that their mom (60ish) lives comfortably in a spacious home that she's willing to let us live at for minimal rent contingent on taking care of the house while we're there. Of course, I'm not oblivious to how good of a situation this is, and I'm incredibly grateful she offered this to us.

This is where my problem with this plan arises: her house (when I went to visit recently) was pretty messy. The kind of mess where clothes are on the floor in the kitchen and pots are left in the bedroom. Cardboard boxes everywhere, non-emptied cat litter boxes, various forms and documents on various surfaces, etc. From what I've gathered from talking with my partner, her house usually looks relatively messy, but some external circumstances before I arrived caused it to get worse, which I can completely understand. However, my partner and their mother both have very severe ADHD, even after taking their medication, and my fear is that I would end up being the one to clean the house every week (while I don't want to play the mental health card, my own moderate OCD plays into this fear. I should also mention that our mental health has caused some minor conflicts in the past, but we have a really solid line of communication that has prevented anything from blowing up).

I've brought up the idea that, if I were to live there long-term, I would appreciate the house to be cleaned relatively soon after I moved in, which they were very open to, and actually said their mom would love the help with cleaning the house. Of course, I would help with that, and I'd also be happy to lead the charge on that if that's what they need, but I want the process to be theirs more, with me just being the one to help out with the manual labor.

However, I've been hesitant to bring up my second concern of becoming a cleaning person for the house when I move in, largely because I don't think my partner will take it well. In the past when I've tried to help them clean their dorm room and keep it clean, they've reacted poorly and with discomfort, which I've tried my best to be kind to. But because of these reactions, I'm scared to get even more involved when it comes time to live with them fully, and I'm afraid that I may end up silently doing most of the work and only delegating when I'm at the end of my rope instead of when it would be beneficial for everyone else.

Reddit, WIBTA if I made my partner and their mom help me keep the house clean before and while I live there?",No A-holes here,2024-05-28,"WIBTA for wanting my partner and their mom clean up before I move in? My (20F) partner (20X) and I both attend college out of state from where we're originally from, but we used to live in very different areas (myself from LA, my partner from Chicago). We're likely moving back to Chicago together after college for a number of reasons, but the main one is that their mom (60ish) lives comfortably in a spacious home that she's willing to let us live at for minimal rent contingent on taking care of the house while we're there. Of course, I'm not oblivious to how good of a situation this is, and I'm incredibly grateful she offered this to us.

This is where my problem with this plan arises: her house (when I went to visit recently) was pretty messy. The kind of mess where clothes are on the floor in the kitchen and pots are left in the bedroom. Cardboard boxes everywhere, non-emptied cat litter boxes, various forms and documents on various surfaces, etc. From what I've gathered from talking with my partner, her house usually looks relatively messy, but some external circumstances before I arrived caused it to get worse, which I can completely understand.

172,1d2idgf,AITA for not showing up at my dads wedding? ,"
We 3 children (f25, f28, m24) decided not to go to my father's wedding (August 24).
He has been in a relationship for 5 years and getting married now. They sent us the invitation.
We signed up, but recently deregistered.
We deregistered because we think that we have too little contact with our father, especially since he started the relationship.
At least we sisters recently checked out personally at their home.
The maid of honor happened to be there too and the bride was busy with wedding matters.
We first spoke to our father, who was very upset. When we informed the bride, she asked us whether we thought this rejection would improve our relationship with our father.
We think this is not her right.
My sister in particular cried and we left and our father tried to stop us in the car
But that doesn't help, we've made our decision
Don't you think it's better that way than just appearing without conviction?

Am I the asshole? 


EDIT: Well thanks for the comments on here 

I wrote this in the eyes of the children my stepdad has. Cause last Sunday they showed up here and did what i said up there which caused in a HUGE fight

I wanted to proof the point to my stepdad, that he doesn’t have to run after these ungrateful children

173,1d2iabq,WIBTA for telling my FIL he cannot show up to his own house unannounced?,"My husband (31M) and I (29F) are building a house at the moment and we were able to get a loan easier because we can live currently rent free in the second property of my father-in-law who was previously renting it out. We will be living here for about 2 years in total and have worked out a solution where we will pay the entire rent and then some in one big sum in about 3 years. By then I will have finished my medical residency and will be able to pay for it as an attending. My FIL was kind of glad that we would move in because then he would be able to do some touch ups in the yard and install solar panels etc, which was more difficult with renters living here. 

We have been living here for about 3 months now and I have given birth 10 weeks ago to my second child, so I am home a lot because of maternity leave. Which means that all the touch ups and installing and workers coming through happens while I am at home with a newborn child. My FIL is a very kind man and I love him dearly, but he is here a lot now and it makes it difficult for me to relax. 

He usually announces it when he comes but not always. For example, today, we had asked him if he were able to watch my newborn for one day so I could go out for a run, do some necessary chores in the house and study for my final exam of residency which is difficult while taking care of a newborn. It is the first time we asked someone to take care of our son, so it is not a habit. While I was taking a bath after my run, my FIL called me and said he was in the house with my kid and some electricians to do some work relating to the solar panels. I was not told he was going to come and was very annoyed because it is hard to relax when strangers are in my home, they had to shut off electricity so I could not study (all the material is online) and they walked in the house with dirty shoes about 45 minutes after I had mopped the floor.

So now I am feeling quite pissed towards him, but I know that he never meant to inconvenience me. And we are living here rent free, in his house, and he does a lot for us when it comes to childcare etc. He is a very kind man and I feel so bad for being annoyed, which is why I am afraid of saying something about it.

174,1d2i43h,AITA for asking my dad about money? ,"(F24) Ok context 
My dad has promised a LOT in my life but one of the main big promises that had been through mine and my siblings life was that the house that him & my mum bought would be passed down to us. He has recently started his own businesses and sold the home in order to fund his business which “will buy me and my sibling a home each”. Granted he is earning an awful lot of money from this job he has done AMAZING with setting it up and getting it going however.. 
There has been so many broken promises of similar through out my life. Me and my sibling are suppose to get £10k out of the home which was promised to come to us next month (June 2024) I asked about it today and he has again put it off saying we probably won’t get it next month it could be next month, it could be the end of the year or he could want to hold it for even longer. This was shortly after saying he had just billed ONE contractor for over £100K and he took home £10K+ last month alone. 
I’m not looking for the full £10K upfront there’s just somethings going on in my life rn it would be helpful for like Debt, car that has been off the road and now needs repairs & I am worried about my fertility as a LWL and trying to conceive. I feel annoyed but I also feel like I’m being a spoilt brat? I work, study and live with my partner who we have really struggled this month and have been short on essentials at home which he isn’t aware about because I don’t want him to throw loads of money at me expecting me to pay it back when I can’t afford to right now (that’s also happened before £20 can’t be just £20 it has to be £50 and I need to pay it back whether I like it or not). 

I feel my emotions of past experiences with him and promises of things might be making me clouded. So many times me and my sibling were promises to go abroad (we went once at 6&4 years old) with him and his side of the family SO much and never did but we would always hear about him going abroad or away with them and how “we should come next time” as CHILDREN. Or how we would go do other things together that would fall through or we wouldn't go because we would talk about it so much he would get annoyed so we didn't go. Times he promised to be at things and wouldn’t be there or follow through like when I moved in with him at 15 and he didn’t even spend my first birthday since I was 6 with him and again telling me he wouldn’t be there for my 18th for him to be angry that I was upset. I have been debating telling him to never promise my future children things unless they’re in his hand or they’re going that day because I don’t want them to be met with the same disappointment I have a lot in my life.

She decided not to have traditional bridal party (her brother will be her MOH, there won’t be any bridesmaids), she just wants a bachelorette weekend away with a group of 10-15 girls. 

She asked her best friend to organize the whole thing. 

Over the first few weeks this girl never asked who would be able to come, never specified exact dates, only sent screenshots of a handful of emails from houses / villas that rejected her (either due to no availability / not wanting to host a bach party). 

I was starting to stress out about this, because we were about 8 weeks out at this point, and essentially had nothing planned. 

At this point she texted the group asking for help. She said that she couldn’t find a place for us to stay and that we may need to cancel / reschedule. 
I love planning trips, and am a very type A person, so I decided to jump in. 
I went a little crazy and created a spreadsheet with 8 prospective hotels / villas / glamping sites (all at different locations and budgets, as this was not discussed prior), I also confirmed who would be able to join us. 
I created a poll and asked all the girls to vote for their favorite places (I asked the planner if
this was okay first, she said it was). 

I confirmed with the bride what her preferences were (without spoiling) and booked the favorite (with free cancellation, just in case). 

I (and most of the girls) thought that we were set. Everyone seemed to be in agreement. 

Unfortunately, at this point the planner started intervening. She clearly had some sort of problem with my ideas / actions, but wouldn’t address it directly. 
She suddenly said that we should book another place (that got very few votes), which was only free for one night at this point - and shorten the trip. Nobody said anything to this, so I politely told her that the bride wanted to spend the whole weekend with us, and I don’t think it’s a great idea to drive 4 hours on a friday just to check out on Saturday at noon and drive right back home. 

She then started sending places that were really ugly / not the brides style, extremely expensive, or an 8-9h drive away from where we live. She even asked the bride to change the dates of the bachelorette. 

Everyone is trying to be polite so they are not responding to her, so I’m left being the bad guy and turning down all of these ideas. 

 I feel like an asshole for constantly criticizing her ideas, I also feel like she may be annoyed that I “took over her job” (even though she asked for it)… but if I don’t do it nobody will and I’m worried that we will not be going on a bach trip at all. Am I out of line?

178,1d2hmk3,AITA for making my gf mad last night?,"Me(22) and my gf(20) were on the phone last night right before bed and she had an idea of going through each others following list on tik tok. (for the record, not in a toxic way, she was just bringing it up in a joking way and i went along and was like “i have nothing to hide let’s see”, and that’s how that happened.) So tik tok has a setting where your following list can be private so when we both made our following list public i was trying to explain that any people that look suspicious was just from a couple years back where i would just follow anybody i saw, but she didn’t let me say much, as she thought i was just making excuses which makes sense i don’t blame her for that. So, long story short she found a couple girls i follow and kept naming them and i was doing the same with the guys she follows but when it came to me naming them she would brush it off and use the girls i followed as defense. So then she found a gym girl account and told me i’m done for the day (in a joking “i’m mad” tone) and i was like “yup me too” in the same tone, and she said “im sick to my stomach” so then I copied her word for word to tease her and replied with “i’m sick to my stomach!” then she said “be quiet” and i responded with “you be quiet!” and the way i said you be quiet made her upset and now she’s giving me the cold shoulder and she actually got upset and is telling me “im ready for bed” and “i don’t want to talk right now” and im apologizing and saying I was only going along with you and she said it doesn’t matter you still told me to be quiet. So now i feel like a d**k because the way she put it makes me feel like i yelled at her but i really only meant it in a joking way, plus i was only copying her. (I know the things on this community are far more serious, but i’ve never yelled at her and always made sure i never did. This is really big to me since i would never want to remind her of past traumas.)

179,1d2hbic,AITA For Accidentally Waking Up My F26 Girlfriend By Going Downstairs?,"Here's a little context for our problem. My (M25) girlfriend (F26) is a teacher, and she just started her summer break. At the current moment, we occasionally sleep in separate bedrooms because she is an extremely light sleeper, and she can't really fall asleep when I'm in bed with her. My bedroom is on the top floor of our townhouse, and she's in the basement.

As of late, I have been consistently waking up at 6:45am or 7am. This wasn't always the case, as I've always liked to sleep in a little more, but I've recently made a lot of lifestyle changes and I wanted to start waking up earlier to get ahead of the day.

Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how quiet I am going downstairs, but she still manages to wake up. Our floors on the middle floor are creaky, and they manage to wake her up every time. When we had opposite schedules (I would sleep in a little longer and she would wake up early for school), it wasn't an issue, but she would still restrict me to the top floor during the night so I didn't wake her up. I didn't really have a problem with that since there is everything I need on the top floor of our townhouse.

Today, I came downstairs (literally tiptoing) to get a measuring cup for my morning protein shake. I also let the cat out (the door is a little noisy), and immediately went back upstairs. She came up five minutes later and got really angry at me for waking her up, slamming her door on the way back downstairs. I find this as manipulative, controlling, and selfish behavior, but I wanted to get more perspective on the issue before I confront her.

Am I being unreasonable here? I feel that she shouldn't be interrupting my morning routine like this, especially since I have work.

EDIT: First of all, thank you for all of your perspectives. Because switching rooms has been suggested a lot, I wanted to clarify a few things. We've already been openly communicating regarding this problem, and compromise has been difficult for us on this front. There are three problems with switching rooms.

1. She wanted the basement because it's a bigger space. I personally don't care enough to be down there, but being there is her prerogative.

2. She doesn't like how my mattress feels. In fact, the mattress was originally hers, but we switched because she liked mine better. It's also too much of a PITA to move all of our belongings between rooms.

3. My office is on the top floor (the basement is only one room). I am someone who values separating my work life and my home life, so I need my own office space. I pay extra rent for it too. Unfortunately, if we did switch, I feel she would complain I'm too noisy in the office as well. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA For Accidentally Waking Up My F26 Girlfriend By Going Downstairs?

180,1d2h3s7,AITA for criticizing my friend’s art?,"Me and my friend are both 19F and we’re both artists. I don’t think we should compare our art overall because there are some things that she is definitely much better than me at (like colors, and lighting, and drawing animals) but it would also be fair to say that I am better than her at human anatomy because my style is more realistic and I overall put lot of effort into studying how the human body works. Our styles are very different and whenever we talk about our drawings I always consider the fact that her style is much more simplified and “cartoonish”/anime than mine so I make sure never to tell her that she should draw more realistically because I just know that this is not what she is going for.
However, every now and then she does draw realistically. And one day she showed me her drawing of a very cool semi-realistic eye. I loved everything about it but I noticed that it looked a little too symmetrical, as in, if it wasn’t for the eyebrow, it would be impossible to tell if it’s the right or the left eye so I told her something along the line of “This looks absolutely amazing, but perhaps you should try fixing this small thing, so it doesn’t look too symmetrical”. I thought I was giving some casual and useful advice but she (very unexpectedly to me at least) got very offended and angry, and told me that and I quote “if she wanted my opinion, she would’ve asked for it, but she didn’t”. I got really confused and told her I didn’t know what I was supposed to say when she showed me her drawing. I jokingly said “do you want me to always tell you Oh wow that looks amazing good job”? and she (seemingly unironically) said yes. I became even more confused. She was behaving like a small child who got criticized for the first time and I’ve never seen her like this. 
Now I’m having second thoughts. Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything about her anatomical mistake, even tho the drawing was very obviously going for realism? Maybe from now on I should just tell her that all her drawings are good and perfect in every way if this is what she wants? But since her and me are both self-taught and also the only artists in our class, who is going to point out the mistakes she makes, so she can improve? I, as an artist myself, understand that perhaps it doesn’t feel too nice to be criticized and have your mistakes pointed out, but it’s not like i told her that her art sucks and she should start over. AITA? 

Edit: I was advised to edit my post by adding that my friend DID ask me “how is it?” when she showed me her drawing (which is why her phrase “if i wanted your opinion I wouldn’t asked for it” confused me so much). Originally I didn’t add it because yeah, technically her question wasn’t “give me some objective critique to improve my art”.

I am completely over my husband's wanting to save every street rat addict in the world. He always says well that used to be him well not quite because he actually made something of his life and had a successful career and well his friends are living hand to mouth he has a house. 
I was sympathetic at first and now it's just a pattern. About 2 years ago he let him borrow my vehicle while I was with his mother and he was gone for 4 hours.

This morning a friend from university that I have not seen in a while made a group chat with a group of 5 of us from university who haven't had a chance to catch up in over a year and a half. They were talking about meeting up for the weekend next month and the only weekend that everyone was free was my birthday weekend.

Every other weekend of the month at least 3 of us couldn't make it. The plan was to go to the city on the Friday evening and stay for two nights and come back on Sunday Morning.

I mentioned to my girlfriend the possibility of us going away for the day either the weekend before or the weekend after the original weekend we looked at since both of us were also free on those weekends and I explained why.

She said I was being unfair and that I'd rather spend my birthday with friends. I pointed out that wasn't the case and it was the only weekend we could all meet up and I didn't know when I'd get the chance to see them again.

I mentioned that we weren't doing anything on my actual birthday anyway so it should be fine doing a different weekend.

She just said I was prioritising seeing friends over spending my birthday with her but I just see it as, the plans my girlfriend and I were looking at making we can do another weekend and nothing had actually been planned whereas the plans with my friends can only be done on this weekend.

183,1d2fy7y,AITA for telling my (ex) friend that if she doesn't want to sit beside me she's free to leave,"

For background info, I(13,F) am in 9th grade. Previously,I was in the section with all my friends,But in 9th grade,the sections were jumbled up and I was in a new section with no one I knew. That's when I met P(13,F). She also had come from a different section but she had alot of people to talk to. I started talking to her and we quickly became friends. One day,After lunch,She came back from the cafeteria and asked me to switch seats with the partner of her new ""best friend"". I declined because 1) we were sitting in *MY* seat and 2) the partner and her new ""best friend"" made fun of me because I have glasses. P got angry at that and said ""Alr,I'm just gonna write in my diary"" since it was a substitute period,I started reading since I'm a diehard bookworm.But when I glanced at her diary I saw the heading. 




The heading was ""secrets"" 


Obviously I was curious so I started reading,the subtitle was ""Hello dear diary today I'm gonna be telling you some secrets of my partner,Her name is (Insert my first and last name)

Oh no.

I looked away but when I looked back I read the whole thing

""her name is ____ ___, I do not like her because she is a b__ch who deserves to die, She Ignores me and Doesn't want to share her stuff with me,she thinks she's all that but all she does is read books,she's fat and has chest fat and she's tall,She's really ugly and I hope she changes her seat soon.
Thanks diary
Xoxo
P""


Wow
Beside the biography she wrote of me,she made a picture of me,and she exaggerated my features. Just to clarify, The chest fat refers to my breasts,I'm an early bloomer. The ignoring part refers to when She would just randomly stop talking to me so I wouldn't talk to her. I read it all and Was angry and sad at the same time. She saw me looking at it and closed it. 



After that I asked her what it was about and she told me it was about her friend ""Sophia"" 
Oh really?
Nice try P
She started saying stuff about her so called friend. at the end I told her ""You know what's Super funny? I read the whole thing"" 
She shrugged and carried on

Fast forward to the next day she changes her seat to sit with her best friend because her best friend's partner was absent

I saw her sitting at my seat,I went up and told her ""P get the hell out of my seat,if you want to change your seat you can,I have problem,but I don't wanna be involved in your little game of who's better who's bitter"" The 2 girls sitting behind me started defending p saying that it was a friendly joke,And that I was being a big baby. Even the homeroom teacher told me to shut up and to let P sit with me. I hate P and I hate everyone in this goddamn class.

AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-28,"AITA for telling my (ex) friend that if she doesn't want to sit beside me she's free to leave 

For background info, I(13,F) am in 9th grade. Previously,I was in the section with all my friends,But in 9th grade,the sections were jumbled up and I was in a new section with no one I knew. That's when I met P(13,F). She also had come from a different section but she had alot of people to talk to. I started talking to her and we quickly became friends. One day,After lunch,She came back from the cafeteria and asked me to switch seats with the partner of her new ""best friend"". I declined because 1) we were sitting in *MY* seat and 2) the partner and her new ""best friend"" made fun of me because I have glasses. P got angry at that and said ""Alr,I'm just gonna write in my diary"" since it was a substitute period,I started reading since I'm a diehard bookworm.But when I glanced at her diary I saw the heading. 




The heading was ""secrets"" 


Obviously I was curious so I started reading,the subtitle was ""Hello dear diary today I'm gonna be telling you some secrets of my partner,Her name is (Insert my first and last name)

Oh no.

I looked away but when I looked back I read the whole thing

""her name is ____ ___, I do not like her because she is a b__ch who deserves to die, She Ignores me and Doesn't want to share her stuff with me,she thinks she's all that but all she does is read books,she's fat and has chest fat and she's tall,She's really ugly and I hope she changes her seat soon.
Thanks diary
Xoxo
P""


Wow
Beside the biography she wrote of me,she made a picture of me,and she exaggerated my features. Just to clarify, The chest fat refers to my breasts,I'm an early bloomer. The ignoring part refers to when She would just randomly stop talking to me so I wouldn't talk to her. I read it all and Was angry and sad at the same time. She saw me looking at it and closed it. 



After that I asked her what it was about and she told me it was about her friend ""Sophia"" 
Oh really?
Nice try P
She started saying stuff about her so called friend. at the end I told her ""You know what's Super funny? I read the whole thing"" 
She shrugged and carried on

Fast forward to the next day she changes her seat to sit with her best friend because her best friend's partner was absent

Now to Monday 
I saw her sitting at my seat,I went up and told her ""P get the hell out of my seat,if you want to change your seat you can,I have problem,but I don't wanna be involved in your little game of who's better who's bitter"" The 2 girls sitting behind me started defending p saying that it was a friendly joke,And that I was being a big baby.

184,1d2futl,AITA for insisting on having one of the rooms with a private bathroom on our family vacation?,"We will soon be going on the annual family vacation with my husband’s (H) family. We are the youngest adult couple. We are 22 total, 16 adults, 6 kids. The arrangement is that only the adults pay. This applies to both accommodation and groceries.

I earn about twice as much as my H, and one of our financial agreements is that I pay for our vacations.

When the agreement about the cost distribution was made a couple of years ago, I had no objections. Over the past two years, I’ve felt increasingly uncomfortable with it.

Two years ago, when I grabbed a snack, I was told it was for the kids. Last year, I was told the same thing. In both cases, I ate the snack anyway without discussion.

Two years ago, my H and I went grocery shopping with Aunts B and C. The rest of the group had a warm lunch and left nothing for us. My H and I went out to lunch. Aunts B and C made a sandwich.

During lunch last year, food was passed around. We sat at the end of the table. The dishes we received were nearly empty. When we mentioned we had only two servings for five people, we were told to get something else from the cupboard.

I genuinely don’t think there is any ill intent behind these actions, nor that they are directed at me personally. However, I feel that I show more solidarity than I receive. Another factor is that my H and I are the only couple without our own home. My H is trying to build his own business, and I have two jobs with which I am trying to pay off my student debt more quickly. Income-wise, we are not far off from the other family members, but in terms of capital, we are far behind.

This year, a vacation home has been booked, of which only 4 bedrooms have a private bathroom. My H and I have previously indicated verbally that having our own bathroom is very important to us. We also mentioned this in the group chat during the booking. No promises have been made to us.Some have said they don't mind sharing, most have kept quiet.  

AITA if I insist that we get one of these rooms? My H would rather avoid the whole discussion; if it were up to him, we wouldn’t go. For him, the bathroom is now a hard requirement. We have already paid. Normally, the best rooms go to the oldest family members.

I wonder if I’m just being stingy and should keep quiet. The vacations are very enjoyable, and the children are pleasant company. On the other hand, I don’t want our negative feelings to take over and make us not look forward to the vacations anymome. I plan on discussing the cost distribution after this vacation.

186,1d2fm84,AITA: Asking for more CS from my ex after I lost job due to husband's illness. ,"AITA: 

Chris, and I were married for 18 years.  We have 4 children (3 with special needs). Most of our marriage I'm the only one that worked, in 2016, he moved us from PA to SC with the promise I would be a SAHM and he would stop having affairs.  By 2018, he had smashed both promises. He moved out in March 2020.  

It took close to 3 years to get a divorce.  Every time we got close to finalizing it, he would move states or send letters to the judge saying that he couldn't agree with divorce because of spiritual reasons. 

Chris got engaged to someone else the day after we separated. He broke up with her about six weeks later and has had various relationships since. I have only ever been with Nathan, who has joined me in raising my kids since August 2020 when we got together.

While I was working at times multiple jobs to support us when we were married, Chris got a 4 year college degree.  He has used that to have 1 job since 2016. I have worked various blue collar jobs around my kids needs. Nathan, has also turned down promotions or changed jobs to help care for my kids.

I agreed to half of what the state calculator at the time based off my income said for CS to get Chris to show up in court and agree to the divorce. (Couldn't afford a lawyer, had to do it all pro se). Finally divorced December 2022.

Nathan and I got married May 2023.

September 2023, Nathan had a brain aneurysm that ruptured with no warning.  We are incredibly lucky he survived, he can no longer work.  Between caring for him and our 7 children (my 4 bio kids, Nathan's 3 bio) I eventually lost my job in December 2023. 

Nathan has had 4 brain surgeries.  Last week doctors found out he has a hole in his heart, and will require multiple procedures to fix that. 

Chris and I have a custody agreement that he has 38% custody I have 62%.  Custody has changed 3 times due to Chris moving, but I've always had primary.

Chris and I were in a high control religion and when I left him, I left it, (he stayed) thus losing my community. Nathan is an orphan...so no family that way either.  $$ wise Nathan and I are decimated with no one to turn to.

February 2024, Chris met Sandra.  They got married March 15th 2024.  As soon as they did, Chris started just leaving the kids with me, he gets them some still, but every month goes on a week or two week vacation with Sandra. I normally have 2 days notice and suddenly have all the care for our children regardless of custody schedule.

Chris should be paying $1677/month child support.  He pays $617. If I go by what I actually have the kids, not the custody schedule he should pay $2090. I offered to meet in the middle, he refuses.  I've had to file for CS modification pro se.

About a month ago, my matron of honor (Liz) advised me to ask all of the women if they had ordered their dresses yet because the delivery date was getting close to the wedding date. l followed her advice and sent a message to the group. Everyone responded that their dress was delivered or almost there except for one (Sam). Sam responded with ""I have a dress"". The wording made me uneasy, but Sam is known for not being the best texter. The kind where the wording is just kinda off, almost like a grandparent figuring out texting. So I figured she meant she had the dress already. 
Last night, I'm talking to Liz and ask if I'm overthinking Sam's text. She tells me no and that I should ask for a picture of the dress. I didn’t want to because I trust my friend, and there's no way she meant anything other than she has the right dress. Right? I texted her anyway saying something along the lines of having seen everyone else's dress but not hers and asked her to send a picture. Her response was ""cause I already have a maroon dress"". My heart literally dropped. The only thing I could do was respond no, that's not the right color. Sam texted back confused and insisted I said the dress had to be maroon and chiffon but nothing else. I have the screenshots showing in December what I asked for with examples from the website. After that it was just repeated versions of her saying she can't be in the wedding, she's sorry for ruining everything and messing up, that she's such a shit friend, and how she can't afford a dress right now. 
From there I stopped answering. I asked for next to nothing from her for my wedding. I didn't require her to help with anything or come to any of the wedding events (no dress fittings, showers, or bach trip). I just asked this one thing, and she couldn't do that. It honestly feels like my wedding day just wasn't important to her and straight up disrespectful. Here's where I may be the asshole. Liz was a bridesmaid in a wedding a few months ago with the same details as mine for bridesmaid dresses. She pulled out the old dress and it matches perfectly to the dress she bought for my wedding. This dress also happens to perfectly fit another friend of mine (Gabby) who was with us. I now have Gabby taking Sam's place in the wedding. Sam is still invited to the wedding, but she's not a bridesmaid anymore and won't be walking down the aisle.

192,1d2f7vk,AITA for saying I will cook for my family but only under certain conditions?,"I (16m) started cooking for myself 2 years ago for a few reasons. I was always the first person home and would get home hungry and would want to eat. I never really liked the food my parents made and I wanted to start making food I'd enjoy (and yes, I paid for that because my parents didn't buy certain things I wanted to eat). Another thing for me was I always loved cooking and was always interested in becoming a chef when I got older. But practice cooking at my grandparents house wasn't enough to see if I would still love it when I did it all the time or even if I was good enough to do it professionally.

My parents complained that I was cooking a few times. They tried to say I couldn't use their stuff if I wasn't going to make stuff everyone liked and I pointed out I was using money from babysitting to buy the ingredients. They really just didn't like what I was making and so they didn't want their stuff used for it. I was never denied food. But I'd rather eat stuff that I like.

Now my parents are more aggravated by my cooking. They say coming home isn't pleasant when you can smell food and know none of it is for you when you're already hungry. My sisters (11 and 9) complain more too about being hungry when they come home now. Because of this my parents told me I need to start cooking for everyone. I told them I would but only under certain conditions, like they pay for the stuff and let me cook what I want. My parents said that wasn't fair and I told them I had to eat what they liked for years and my stuff is still healthy, just not what they prefer. They told me they won't make me do other chores if I take over the cooking and cook what they prefer. I told them it's not worth it to me. That I'd hate cooking if I was making and eating stuff I don't enjoy.

For context: My parents always default to meat, potatoes and veggies for dinners and stuff. They also mostly go for beef gravy. They never liked doing other things unless we got takeout. I mostly make stir fries, curries, pastas and pies. My parents really don't eat that stuff. My sisters are super picky so who knows what they actually like.

My parents and I argued over this for days and they were pissed I wouldn't budge on things. I told them I would rather stop cooking entirely which pissed them off even more because it's been two solid years and they know I'm growing in my skills. A few times my friends or grandparents have eaten stuff I've cooked and liked it. My parents told me I'm acting so much younger than my age and I'm not being fair to anyone.

195,1d2eycz,AITA for standing up to my sister for my partner?,"I (26F) have been with my partner (27M) for over 5 moths now. I introduced him to my sister (28) and her boyfriend (24), and they hit it off instantly, and over the time my partner and my sister were starting to feel like family and i was super happy it was going that way. This person has made me very happy, and has been nothing but respectful and kind even through our disagreements or fights.

2 days ago, suddenly there was a change in behavior from my sister and her boyfriend towards my partner and I. When I talked to my sister, she said that a friend of hers claims he saw my partner touch her inappropriately at her birthday party while she was drunk. I was shoked at first, unable to believe that my guy would do this. But I still went to him and asked him about it. He said that he respects my sister and would never look at her that way. And he wanted to speak with them and clarify his side. When I calmed down, I went to my sister's room and told her, she refused to speak with him, and her boyfriend instead came and without discussing anything told my man to take his stuff and leave. My partner being a mature and self respecting guy, just without any argument, got up, packed his things and left. And i just stood there in shock of what happened in a mere few minutes with no discussions or hearing sides. Her boyfriend simply told my man he doesn't care if he did it or not.

Right now, my partner and I are in a weird place. He feels very disrespected by my folks, and swears he would never step in this apartment again even if they ever apologized. which is understandable. And we're in a position where i can no longer invite him over, and now we can only meet in public places, as his apartment is not available.

I would like to add that I would protect my sister at all costs. I always make sure the people I bring home will not harm me or her in any way. And if I saw any signs of anything, I would take action right away. What was claimed to be seen that day could be a very huge misunderstanding, because I was there the whole day and I didn't get drunk, on purpose, for a few reasons. My sister was indeed very drunk but my boyfriend only got drunk at the end of the night when everyone has left, and it was only me and him. The only touching I saw was when he was balancing my sister to stand, and there was no sign of any inappropriate touching or eyeing. He was very respectful, he just lent her his arm to lean on without having to actually touch her. My partner keeps swearing and promising that he would never do anything like this and I believe him.

I always asked my sister if she felt comfortable with him around, and she and her guy had actually encouraged giving my partner a key for the apartment. So what happened suddenly?

196,1d2exad,"WIBTA if I called the police because a member of my local community won’t clean up plastic wrap from hay, causing it to fly out onto the road?","Please pardon my language skills as English is not my first language.

I know the title is a bit strange, so let me try to explain.

I live down the road from a horse stud. They have about 15-20 broodmares with foals, 10-12 colts, 10-12 fillies and 1 breeding stallion. All these horses are kept on about 6ha (15 acres), so there isn’t enough grass to keep them all fed. In my opinion, this is just too many horses for not a lot of space, but that is just my opinion.

As such, the breeder uses huge plastic-wrapped hay bales that they put in the pastures, which I would have no issue with if they removed the plastic either when putting the fresh bale in or after it’s gone. They do neither. The plastic just gets left, and they have been doing this for years, so the ground is full of it now. Most of the plastic has been covered in mud during winter when the horses walk in and on it, but some of the plastic gets loose and flies around, sometimes into the road.

I use this road almost daily and last December we had a bit of a storm come through. I had to go out and as I’m passing their property a huge piece of plastic flies across the road about 25-30m in front of my car. It could just as easily have hit my windscreen, and I wouldn’t have been able to see anything.

I was pissed when I came home. I decided to write them an email, and after my friend calmed me down and told me I should be a little bit more positive in my wording of said email, I sent it off.

Here is what I wrote:

*Hi \[name of owner\]*

*I am a great fan of people doing what they want on their own property, but when those actions affect others, I get a bit upset.*

*On more than one occasion I have noticed plastic on the side of the road next to your property, and on the road. Yesterday when I was driving past a large piece of plastic flew across the road right in front of my car. Fortunate, it didn’t hit my car, but it could easily have done so, creating a dangerous situation for me.*

198,1d2eqwh,AITA for complaining about my autistic friend because she keeps insulting me even after I've asked her to stop?,"I (16 NB) have a friend (16 F) who I'll call Alex. Alex is autistic, she doesn't mask and has a hard time understanding social cues. I know that autism can make it hard for someone to understand when they're hurting others' feelings, so I just wanted some perspective from outside sources.

Okay, so the actual situation. Alex and I both go to the same music class. We both get there about an hour and a half early because I have another class in the same building before and her sister is in the class that starts then. During this extra time, we hang out, mostly going outside and stuff. Lately, it's been really hot and rainy so we've been staying inside instead. 

Alex is a really good artist, and she draws constantly, so while stuck inside we've been drawing stuff together. She's a good artist but I'm not. I honestly suck, but I like art and I also draw a lot so I can try and get better. Alex often shows me her art and asks my opinion, and I started doing the same. She knows that I don't draw as much as her and that I'm still learning, but she was still unkind and rude about my art. Sometimes she even asks to hold my paper so she can 'fix' whatever I drew. It's really discouraging and makes me not want to draw. A couple of weeks ago I told Alex that her comments about my art hurt my feelings. I told her that it makes me not want to draw and that I don't need her to give me compliments about what I know is bad art, but that she's basically just been insulting me. I also asked her not to 'fix' my art for me anymore. She seemed okay with it, but she didn't apologize for hurting my feelings was kinda dismissive about the whole thing, and acted like I was blowing it out of proportion.

She hasn't stopped and if anything has gotten meaner about the whole thing. I've started pointing out when she says rude things and asking her not to say stuff like that, to no avail. So this is where I might be the asshole, I ended up just venting about all of this to two of our mutual friends in a group chat. One of them was really supportive, but the other told me that I was making a big deal out of nothing and ended up sending the screenshots to Alex. Alex got really mad at me and said that she's just autistic and that she can't help being rude. She said that since she's neurodivergent I shouldn't complain or take it personally. I'm also neurodivergent though, and I can't really help but take it personally

She hasn't stopped and if anything has gotten meaner about the whole thing. I've started pointing out when she says rude things and asking her not to say stuff like that, to no avail. So this is where I might be the asshole, I ended up just venting about all of this to two of our mutual friends in a group chat. One of them was really supportive, but the other told me that I was making a big deal out of nothing and ended up sending the screenshots to Alex. Alex got really mad at me and said that she's just autistic and that she can't help being rude. She said that since she's neurodivergent I shouldn't complain or take it personally. I'm also neurodivergent though, and I can't really help but take it personally

So AITA for complaining about my autistic friend>",0.0,0.03080415539443493,0,1

I asked why and she just said she doesn't want them decorating the apartment. I told her that it's my apartment aswell so I should get a say in how we decorate it and that I should choose some things that I like but she just said she doesn't think it'll look good. 

KI just told her again that I should get to choose things to have for decoration, not just her but she just said to put the stuff back. I pointed out I am using my money ot pay for it so she can't really tell me what to buy.

200,1d2eonc,AITA for telling my roommate his girlfriend can't be staying over here as much?,"Hello,

I (28M) have moved into an apartment with my friend, (28M) almost 2 months ago. He moved in about a month ago because he took his time with buying a bed and a closet for his room. When he moved in I went on vacation for 2 weeks, and when I came back he was at the house with his girlfriend.

so far so good, obviously he should feel at home and comfortable bringing his girlfriend over, which is something he told me he wanted to do before we moved in and I said of course because it's his house as well.

not long after I came back he had to take a week-long overseas work trip, and his girlfriend flew with him. When he went away, he texted me ""enjoy the empty house, ""Amanda"" (fake name) will be coming back on the 20th"" (when he returns on the 22nd).

I thought to myself ok that's a bit odd but It's just 2 days, let's see. She came back and the next morning I went to work only to come back and be greeted with loads of dishes in the sink, on the countertop, food outside, trash in random places, and lights turned on for no reason and she wasn't home. I planned to talk to him once he gets back. He got back and she remained here, even when he was at work. she slept here, washed her laundry here, showered, everything. She's basically living here.

She took control of a shelf in the bath with all of her lotions and her DISGUSTING hairbrush just lays there in the shower. On Sunday he told me he's planning to duplicate a key for her and asked if I would like one as well.

I confronted him and told him this wasn't our agreement, she is basically living here and this isn't her house, it's yours but it's also mine. I understand their need to be together but he's not living alone and cannot decide on such an arrangement without asking me. He said she lives 1-1.5 hours away by car and when she's on break between semesters she's at his place (his place being his parents' place, he was living with them before we moved in together), and she has a job at a local restaurant.

I told him it's not my responsibility to cater to the fact she lives far and wants to be with you during her breaks, and that this is not a hotel. I told him that there's a difference between ""I want her to come over"" and ""I want her to full-on live here from time to time"".

202,1d2eale,AITA for telling my sister she's failing her oldest son if she doesn't get him the help and support he needs?,"I (29f) told my sister Kate (33f) that she will be failing her oldest son Cody (11m) if she doesn't get him the help and support he needs.

Cody's birth father left when Kate got pregnant. Ben entered their lives near the end of my sister's pregnancy but they didn't start dating until Cody had just turned 1. Ben was an amazing dad and none of us doubted he truly adored Cody as saw him as his own. Ben adopted Cody when Cody was 3. When Cody was 7 Kate ended up pregnant with their second kid. Cody struggled with jealousy but Ben was amazing and spent extra time with Cody to show him nothing would change between them. And then Ben died before the baby was born and it completely destroyed Cody. 

Everything got worse when Kate gave birth to Shane 7 weeks after Ben died. Ben's parents only cared about Shane and showed how they only treated Cody like a grandson because of Ben, but with Ben no longer here, Shane was all they cared about, because he was blood. This made the jealousy return and come back with a vengeance and twisted with deep resentment. Ben's sister still treated Cody the same though and tried her best to make up for everything. But it wasn't enough because as close as they are, Cody grieved for a dad and grandparents he thought loved him.

Things are worse than ever now because Kate has remarried and Shane calls her husband dad. They want Cody to do the same and try building that relationship. But it makes Cody so angry. The new husband has been so dismissive of Cody missing Ben because ""Ben isn't his real father"". Shane calling his stepdad dad has made Cody more resentful and more bitter toward him. My parents and my two brothers and other sister have spoken to Kate about Cody needing help, Ben's sister also spoke to her. I tried once before. But she dismisses us all and doesn't believe this is so damaging or harmful to Cody. She thinks he'll be fine when he accepts the way things are.

Last week Cody had a meltdown at a birthday party in front of the whole family. He said Shane didn't deserve Ben and that he wishes Shane had died instead of Ben because he wanted his dad and not Shane. He told Kate that she never really loved Ben and told Kate's husband that he'll never be as good as Ben. It was so hard to watch. Kate and her husband left early with the kids. Ben's sister reached out after she heard what happened and said she was so worried but Kate refuses to listen to her. She also said her parents don't care so they won't try being there for Cody.

This is when I decided Kate needed to hear it and I told her she failing Cody and she'll continue to fail him if she doesn't get him the help and support he needs. I told her we have all tried to be kind and sweet about it but she needs to hear that she's a failure. Of course she didn't like hearing that but has cursed at me every day since for saying that to her and she called me a judgmental bitch who needs to mind my own business.

205,1d2dqju,AITA for hanging out with the girl my best friend hates,"*will be using fake names 

I (18F) have been best friends with Sam (18F) for the past 2.5 years through high school. We met in the 7th grade and had been friends ever since, but became especially close after we both experienced fallouts with other friends. Sam fell out with Tara (18F) right when the COVID lockdown started and I fell out with my friend group at the end of freshman year. 

For background with Sam and Tara, they had been friends through middle school and things took a turn for the worst after Tara’s mom was diagnosed with cancer. They got into a big fight and didn’t speak after that. 

Where the issue comes in is that Tara and I had known each other beforehand because of Sam. After their falling out, I continued to be kind and cordial towards Tara, and this year we became closer because of mutual friend groups over lapping. We went to a couple parties together, hung out a few times, and spent the weekend at our friend’s college for an awards ceremony. 

I should also say, all of these things I did with Tara, I had invited Sam to come to all of these activities first since she is usually my go to. I am a very spur of the moment person so usually if I get an idea to do something, I text Sam, and if she can’t come I will keep texting friends until someone says yes. 

 At first, I didn’t mention hanging out with Tara to Sam because I didn’t want her to feel pushed out or hurt. I eventually ended up talking to Tara about her thoughts on their falling out to gain more perspective. I knew it wasn’t my place to try and make them friends again, and if Tara had said anything I’ll about Sam I absolutely would have defended her, but Tara was very apologetic and sympathetic toward Sam when speaking about the way things ended between them. 

Long story short, I told Sam that I was hanging out with Tara, and she told me she would never forgive Tara and that she hated her. I continued to hangout with Tara ( in total it has probably been 6 times over the last 3 months) and it all came to a boiling point today after Sam made a rude comment about Tara and I told her I wasn’t going to stop being friends with Tara to make Sam happy. 

I would also like to say that while I understand the pain of losing a friendship, Sam and Tara’s falling out happening in the 8th grade (almost five years ago). I am not someone to hold a grudge so it is somewhat hard for me to sympathize with that aspect of the situation.

We all had a sit down and she became irate with me calling me “problematic” and a “dick” because I did not want to accept that behavior from her. I told her I have sympathy and empathy for anger issues, but that this was unacceptable behavior. Her gf tried to tell me she grew up in a household where it was the culture to scream and slam doors and I should be more sensitive to her not being able to change that behavior. I wasn’t buying it. I said that well I guess I will be moving out because it seems we are incompatible to live with each other. She turned red from anger and said “I can’t do this” she got up, slammed the chair back into the table and stormed off. I’m not the asshole and this is clearly generally unacceptable behavior from an adult right? Trying to prove a point here.",0.0,-0.0010743115562945604,0,1
207,1d2cz5a,AITA for gaming too much?,"This is my first post so bare with me.

My bf (20M) of 1.5 years started insisting recently that I (20F) have been spending too much time gaming with my friends.

Context: I'm a PC gamer. I game a lot. Always have, Always will, Its what I enjoy doing. And since my best friend (19M and gay) moved away for college its the only time I get to spend with him (and my other friends since we all enjoy gaming together.) I was a gamer before my bf even met me. I own a nice PC setup and spend my days working (at a restaurant), gaming withfriends, or spending time with him.

We've had several talks about his problems with my screen time. I'll use the most recent one as an example: He invited me to have dinner with him and his family earlier today around 4pm and told me they would eat around 9pm. I told him I already had plans for the day and was currently driving to pick up my friend and go painting. He quickly remembered that I had already made plans for the day and told me that maybe If I was done in time I could stop by and hang out for a bit and followed up with ""I just wanted to invite you."" I responded saying stuff like ""yeah maybe I'll let you know"" but generally my plans with my friend were my first priority since I had plans with her already and he invited me at 4pm pretty late in the day. My friend and I went painting and got a bite to eat and agreed to go back home and get online together with our other two friends. After dropping my friend off at her house I went back to mine. I got home around 9:30 and 10 minutes after I got home my bf called me and asked ""Are you still coming?"" to which I reply ""Ehh Idk Im kinda tired."" His attitude shifts and he gets frustrated asking why I even went home when I could've just driven straight over from dropping off my friend. I told him I had to check on my roommates dogs and I just wanted to relax and get online with my friends. He immediately goes tunnel vision about me getting online and starts saying things like ""So you're not tired then, you're just gonna game."" and ""You just wanna play video games with your friends."" ""It gets in the way of everything."" and ""You gaming is more important than dinner with my family."" I responded saying things like ""I don't wanna drive all the way back to \[insert city name\]"" and ""everyone is getting online tonight"" ""I already had plans."" and ""You told me last minute."" At the end of all this he goes nonchalant and says ""Do whatever you want."" and I said ""No, cause you're just gonna be mad"" he repeats that a few more times before closing with ""Go play your games bruh."" and hung up.

I've asked my gaming friends what they think and they all say ""red flag. I want to be a good gf but I don't want to keep changing myself for him to be satisfied. I don't want to give up gaming or even cut back because its my hobby. And I spend time with my friends this way.

208,1d2cvw9,AITA for having me and my dad and not my mom on my profile picture,"Some backstory my parents are divorced, been so since I was like 10. At 17 my dad moved to Georgia for a job opportunity (which is like eight hours away from where my school is) so I’ve been full time at my moms she’s can be kinda a dictator but I still love her to death. I recently graduated from high school. (go me :p) After the long as hell ceremony was done, I finally graduated. After all the graduates are done, they all go to the other gym in my school so we can take pictures with teacher other graduates and of course are parents. So I take pictures with my dad who drove 8 hours just to stay there for like 2 hours.  Then my mom and my step dad. During all the pictures my dad is crying, It’s rare for him to cry he was a marine so he’s doesn’t like to cry in front of people especially me. But the reason  why he’s crying is because my grandpa his dad died when my dad was 17 so he never saw him graduate, and the sadness part my dad is the same age as my grandpa was 51. So it just kinda got to him. The next day I was home by myself and I thought, I should probably update my profile pic on my social medias, I haven’t changed it since like early junior year. And I was missing my dad, and I know he misses me. So I changed it to me and him in my cap and gown. It’s a really nice father and son picture, and one of the few pictures of me actually smiling. Later on my mom comes back home from a barbecue she had with some church friends. (I didn’t go so I could play helldivers dead ass) but anyway, she was just obnoxiously sighing around me. So since she was obviously trying to get my attention I say, “what’s wrong mom?” (Mother) “nothing just me and your step dad feeling left out” (me thinking it was because I stayed home) “oh sorry I just didn’t feel like going out” (my mom quickly replies back) “no it’s just why would you put your profile of you and your father and not of all of us” (referring to me, her and my step Dad who honestly doesn’t seem to care about it) “well it was a nice pick of me and dad” (mom) “you don’t even live with him anymore he left for Georgia me and step dad are more a part of your life” (again step dad really looks like he could give less of a shit) (me just not in the mood to deal with this because I’m a big boy now) “mom it’s just facebook I still love you I just wanted a pick of me and dad on my profile picture” (mom) “I’m not trying to argue (bullshit) you ask what’s wrong and I told you” *she runs off to her bedroom* this isn’t the first time she tried to start a argument, she’s done it before when I was younger. But I do feel bad for not having her in my social medias, and I was thinking about changing it to something else just so she’ll stop being passive aggressive but I really don’t want to change the picture it looks really good!

209,1d2cs89,AITA for Talking Behind My Best Friends Back? ,"I(18F) have been friends with Luke(18m) since we were 10 years old. He has been my best friend and we’ve always been there for each other. I also have another friend, Belle(18NB), who has become very close to the both of us the past couple years.
The start of our Junior year of High School Luke started working to raise money to move right at the end of school. I was always very supportive of this and was very proud when he got the job. 
By our Senior Year however, he became more distant, going on “work leave” from our school so he only had half of the classes of a normal student. Not only did I never see him at school but i never saw him outside of it other than when he would pick me up every morning. 
Both me and Belle have noticed these mood changes and in an effort to reach out asked if he could come over to Belles house to watch the new season of Bridgerton and to discuss plans to do this summer. After not responding for a whole day he finally told us that he wasn’t doing well. When asked to elaborate on that he didn’t answer for another whole day. 
Belle was very worried and called me multiple times during the day, asking if I’ve heard from him and even reaching out to his younger brother, but we had no luck. 
I texted him asking if he was ok and “to answer back Belle because they’re very concerned”. He responded back 4 hours later with “Thanks for the concern.🤡” Clown emoji and all. I told him yes I was concerned. After leaving me on read he then blocked me on Snapchat.
I told Belle this who then called Luke. Luke told them that I had apparently been talking crap behind his back and that he “had to block that bitch” and that I was only friends with him for his money that he makes from DQ.
For context, I am in an honors band for school and every 2 weeks. While trying to make small talk in the van, my music instructor asked me what kind of Video Games I own since he knows I’m into that. I went into a discussion how Luke had forgotten my birthday the year before and had gotten me the Resident Evil 4 Remastered as an apology. I said that as much as I loved the game, I wish he didn’t spent that much money on me I also mentioned how I missed hanging out with Luke but he’s too busy now and days with DQ. Someone in the van misheard me and thought I said I loved that he spent money on me and that he didn’t have a life outside of his job. They later told him this and apparently he’s been thinking this for the past couple weeks but never confronted me about it.
I’ve also told him multiple times that I don’t like him spending money on me and I flat out refuse when he offers to pay for dinner or movie tickets most the time. 
I just don’t understand why he would believe someone else over 8 years of friendship
I tried telling him it was a misunderstanding and that I’m not mad at anyone but he just won’t listen

210,1d2cqzl,AITA for bursting my mum about my grandads funeral?,"Yes.
I know I sound like a horrible person, but this is the only way I can describe this entire situation!

I’ve got some background info since it comes up-
My parents are separated so,
Monday-Wednesday is with my dad rest is my mum.
And the people encoded is 
Me, 15 F
My mum 
My grandma abreviated to Gram

So anyway, last month my great grandad died and didn’t really suprise everybody in my family.  He was extremely sick and everybody knew it. 

I didn’t really visited him much past the age of 5 since he lives an hour away and I get car sick. At the time I thought everybody would take a month to sort themselves out emotionally then start the funeral.

It was Wednesday and I just came to my mums. She was still at work when I noticed a card on a shelf.
It had a picture with my grandad in it and last Mondays date. I took a full look at it and it said cremation or something like that.

I was shocked! I loved my grandad still and I was so confused if my mum would tell me. So when she came home I asked her about it and she said to “not bother with it.”

I looked dumbfounded and said-
“Not bother with it…? What’s that supposed to mean..? I get you could be grieving but why not tell me?” She just rolled her eyes and said she didn’t want my missing school for it. I’m in year 10 and overachieve and considering it’s the last time I could spend with my grandad.

All my mum did was tell me was that I shouldn’t keep prying at it and this is all because uase I wanted a day of school and I’m disgusting. My mums normal more smarter than that so I tried explaining my side better and she just kept shouting at me.

But then an hour later I’m in my room and gram texted me,
“OP you can’t make your mum mad. That’s so horrible and I can’t believe you.”

I was so clueless. Did I say something? What is it! I texted her back my explaining of what happened and she didn’t budge. My grandma then my uncle kept leaving voicemails and spamming my phone! 

I got sick of it. I told my mum I’m leaving to dads early and she didn’t stop me. I told my dad what happened and he’s so confused why there acting like this too!

Now a few days of passed of texts and voicemails, I genuinely think I’m going insane. I’ve asked my friends and they said there on my mums side. And that it isn’t a big deal and it’s just a funeral.

I think maybe aby there right…? I dunno.. I just wanna go back to my normal mum and my family stop harassing me.

212,1d2c0da,AITAH for telling my mother in law she’s not welcome back in our house? ,"My mother in law recently left from a two week trip to visit us, which has become an annual occurrence. 
Both of my wife’s parents traumatized her severely as a kid. She has various pretty intense issues as an adult as a result. I’ve been supporting her through addressing it all as she battles hard to heal. It’s been quite a journey, and no one before me seemed to know her or care about her enough to see these things and help her face them. It’s been really hard. For her, for me, for our marriage. A LOT of progress has been made, at least. 

Her mother is incredibly judgmental. Will harp on any physical imperfections in my wife, like wrinkles growing under her eyes. We are focused on careers we can believe in, and are not wealthy. Her Mom is always judging us for not having more. She smiles at me and is usually polite, but will talk shit about me to my wife regularly behind my back. And say things like- this place isn’t right for you, you should move away. You should find a rich man to marry have kids with. She’s encouraged her multiple times to leave me for an older, rich, ex. 
In the past, I would pick up on this because my wife would increasingly be on edge, showing signs of disassociation, and sometimes coming down on me and our relationship out of nowhere. Then, usually, she’d break down crying at some point and tell me everything in private. 
Unfortunately, her mother purports to care about her more than her father, who is a whole different basket of fun. My wife has on her own created stronger barriers with him. So I’ve tried to support her in having as good a relationship as possible with her mom and always been cordial. 
My wife stood up to her mom this time and stood up for us. But I can still see how negatively it all impacts her, and us. It’s also just so offensive and hurtful to me. We feed her good meals, entertain her, and bring her into our lives broadly when she visits. 
Anyway, though my wife handled it better and the fallout seems less- I’ve had it. My wife shared w me her comments throughout the trip this time, and we were both just kind of shocked and disgusted with how rude she was being. There were good moments, and she wrote my wife a kind and heartfelt letter at some point. 
Nonetheless, I told my wife I’d reached my limit and that she was not welcome back. They could make plans to see each other outside of our home, in others ways, if she wanted. But I don’t want to wittingly support this behavior and welcome it into my life anymore. My wife seems to understand. I wrote my mother in law and told her she’s no longer welcome because she comes into our lives and disrespects me and our marriage. (She also preys on and exacerbates my wife’s insecurities, but that’s their business.)
If it where anyone else I’d have drawn a line a long time ago. It’s a heartbreaking situation and I feel a little bad about it. She’s the most loving parent my wife has.

I’ve been supporting her through addressing it all as she battles hard to heal. It’s been quite a journey, and no one before me seemed to know her or care about her enough to see these things and help her face them. It’s been really hard. For her, for me, for our marriage. A LOT of progress has been made, at least. 

Her mother is incredibly judgmental. Will harp on any physical imperfections in my wife, like wrinkles growing under her eyes. We are focused on careers we can believe in, and are not wealthy. Her Mom is always judging us for not having more. She smiles at me and is usually polite, but will talk shit about me to my wife regularly behind my back. And say things like- this place isn’t right for you, you should move away. You should find a rich man to marry have kids with. She’s encouraged her multiple times to leave me for an older, rich, ex. 
In the past, I would pick up on this because my wife would increasingly be on edge, showing signs of disassociation, and sometimes coming down on me and our relationship out of nowhere. Then, usually, she’d break down crying at some point and tell me everything in private. 
Unfortunately, her mother purports to care about her more than her father, who is a whole different basket of fun. My wife has on her own created stronger barriers with him. So I’ve tried to support her in having as good a relationship as possible with her mom and always been cordial. 
My wife stood up to her mom this time and stood up for us. But I can still see how negatively it all impacts her, and us. It’s also just so offensive and hurtful to me. We feed her good meals, entertain her, and bring her into our lives broadly when she visits. 
Anyway, though my wife handled it better and the fallout seems less- I’ve had it. My wife shared w me her comments throughout the trip this time, and we were both just kind of shocked and disgusted with how rude she was being. There were good moments, and she wrote my wife a kind and heartfelt letter at some point. 
Nonetheless, I told my wife I’d reached my limit and that she was not welcome back. They could make plans to see each other outside of our home, in others ways, if she wanted. But I don’t want to wittingly support this behavior and welcome it into my life anymore. My wife seems to understand. I wrote my mother in law and told her she’s no longer welcome because she comes into our lives and disrespects me and our marriage. (She also preys on and exacerbates my wife’s insecurities, but that’s their business.)
If it where anyone else I’d have drawn a line a long time ago. It’s a heartbreaking situation and I feel a little bad about it. She’s the most loving parent my wife has. AITAH?",0.0,0.004776647314429283,0,1
213,1d2bx2w,AITA For Leaving Boyfriend’s apartment in Middle of the Night ,"Me (32F) and my boyfriend (36M) do not live together. He lives roughly 30-45 minutes away across town. We often rotate between staying at his place and staying at my place. We have been doing this in the 10+ months we’ve been seeing each other. 

I have been struggling with major anxiety lately due to my job and personal health. I’ve been taking regular anxiety medication and attempting more holistic approaches. My boyfriend is aware of this but due to his autism, is not the best at providing support. 

Around midnight one night I woke up in a full blown panic attack; sweating, shaking, nauseated, chest pain, fast heart beat, plus shortness of breath. I tried calming myself down but was not able to. I honestly thought I was dying. Unfortunately I did not bring my lorazepam to his house, as I hadn’t really used it yet. I tried waking him up to help me but by 1am I realized that the only thing I needed was to go take my other medication. 

I texted his phone, gave him a kiss and snuck out around 1:10am. I got home around 1:30 due to no traffic and texted him that I made it and was sorry. 

The next day at 7am I received 20 angry texts from him. He was upset that I had left and didn’t wake him up. He was also upset I left his front door unlocked, even though I don’t have a key. I tried explaining that I felt very unwell and needed my emergency medication. However he was upset I didn’t get him up as he could have went and got it. After I explaining I tried my hardest and thought it was best to leave, he said that I put him at risk and made him anxious in the morning. 

We haven’t talked in a few days because of this fight/argument. 

My friends are divided on whether I should have stayed or if it was alright for me to go home. Two of my friends are siding with him, basically saying I should always keep my emergency medicine on me and that I placed him in a vulnerable spot by leaving. However I personally disagree as I did everything I could to stay but was only getting worse. 

Am I the asshole for leaving my boyfriends in the middle of the night without telling him due to a panic attack?

214,1d2bx0m,AITA for ruining my relationship with my parents over a lie?,"I (22f) have always had a pretty close relationship with my parents but one thing I have never done is talk to them about my private life. I still live with my parents and over my winter break from university my partner came to visit me and my family. Leading up to them meeting my partner, my mom felt that it was important to consistently ask me if I’d ever had sex and to monitor my status of getting birth control. I lied to her and said I hadn't done it before but I was looking into birth control (which that part was true). My partner came and it just turned into a complete shit show, where mortifyingly my parents asked my partner about drugs and if we’d had sex (which my partner was honest about) and then pulled a classic teen lecture on us about them. They also made very disrespectful and crazy assumptions about my partner all in attempts to convince me to break up with them. 

Afterwards, my mom expressed her disappointment that because I lied to her about my sex life she feels betrayed and no longer has trust in me. I tried to express to my parents that I was completely mortified in that whole drug and sex conversation as I felt it wasn’t their place to say that especially with my partner there. My dad just acted like he was a saint for doing it and that my partner opened up the conversation when they had mentioned they’d done shrooms previously. 

I left to go back to college and we didn’t talk until my mom sent a check up message expressing she wanted to. To summarize, she just went on about how this whole situation made her stressed, they just wanted what was best for me, lectured me about lying and how she thought we had a better relationship than that. I did apologize for lying but tried to tell them it was not my obligation to tell them about my private matters.

When I came home for the summer we sat down to chat where they blamed me for everything that had happened because I lied to them. They requested an in-person apology for lying and they wanted me to acknowledge that if I hadn’t lied to them then things wouldn’t have turned out how they did. They did feel bad for having judged my partner harshly but because I lied that's why they didn’t like my partner in the first place. My mom then asked what “boundaries'' she was meant to follow and I tried to explain that I thought it was unacceptable to inquire about your child's sex life and I didn't want to talk about my relationships ever again with them. My dad responded that it's just a parent's job to worry and that's why it's okay to ask these personal things and I should answer them honestly. They then proceeded to treat my lie like it was the most relationship shattering thing they ever experienced and how they no longer have trust in me and that I will need to work very hard to get that back with them moving forward.

My 15 year old son lives with him and i only see him every other weekend and his little brother who lives with me currently also barely sees him on weekends as well because he ALWAYS has something going on.

Football games, quinceanera practice for his friend, homecoming, football practice.  I find I am always needing to switch weekends or lose time or drive an hour to pick him up from his events.  Just this weekend (my weekend) I had to drive all the way an hour to his city to pick up my son because he had a quinceanera that I didn’t agree to and his dad could not help with because he was not in town.  He basically told me it was up to me if I wanted to let him go or not?? But he could have cancelled his vacation he planned to switch weekends with me.

So my ex went on vacation over memorial day weekend.  Apparently he was flying back Monday early afternoon, but due to hail and thunder??? His flight got delayed for 5-6 hours and he told me he wasn’t going to be able to meet up at the halfway point until 845 pm (normal pick up time is 730 pm). 

I told him no, that won’t work and he needs to drive to my house (an extra hour total) to get our son.

My view is: its his fault for going on vacation and if he really cared about our son he would have made sure he was there on time to pick him up at 730 pm.  And i am already flexible because I drove all the way to his city to pick up our son from his quinceanera.

When I was 9 months pregnant I found out my husband was fooling around with a coworker. It was really tense and stressful but I forgave him. It has been 5 months since then.

I found out recently they still talk as friends on SC. I told him I was uncomfortable with this because he had cheated on me with her. He blocked her at the time, but I found out he unblocked her, because she asked him about it at work. He said I needed to grow up and blocking her makes things at work more difficult and awkward. Also, if it spreads around the hospital it will cause major issues.

I told him he should have thought about that before fucking around with a co-worker. He said I am being ridiculous because nothing is going on and he can be her friend if he wants to and that I need to not be so childish.

222,1d2axd3,AITA Raised my voice to teens in a movie theater. ," I took my 10 year old to see Garfield today. There was a group of about 15 teens, around 14/15 years old, sitting in the back, about 6 rows behind us. They were being extremely loud, but I vaguely remember being that age, and I thought once the previews started they would surely quiet down.
    
As you can guess it only gets worse. They start running around the theatre, yelling out random words, and constantly changing seats. The theatre chairs are set up like chairs in a stadium, with steps going up to the top. Well, as the previews started, they began run leaping down the SEATS, like bounding over the backs and landing on the seats, from the back of the theatre to the front. One family with small children got up and left. When the theater got dark, the ones who were now in the front of the theatre began shining flashlights into the back where we were sitting. At this point I began to suspect that they were trying to get the other patrons to leave, but my daughter and I continued to ignore them, as another family got up and left. 
     
About 15 minutes into the movie, they moved directly behind us. They started squeaking their sneakers on the floor, then one of them put his feet up on the seat back next to me right next to my head. I was boiling at this point, but didn’t respond. I was determined not to give them a reaction, or do what they wanted and leave. Then they started kicking the chair backs on either side of us. I still didn’t acknowledge them. 

Then one of them threw a pair of 3D glasses at my head which narrowly missed and landed in the row in front of me. Whether he missed on purpose, I do not know, but that is when I lost my cool. I stood up, turned around, and with a raised voice said “everyone in this theater is done with your bs. You threw glasses at my head. I could call the police and file a report (probably not but they don’t know that). If you don’t sit down and shut up, I’m going to get the security guards. They were quiet after that.

I think I may be the AH because I raised my voice to other people’s kids, and although I didn’t use a curse word, I used an abbreviation, and told them to shut up.

223,1d2am5f,AITA - My Dad is Dying & I Don’t Care,"Background: My “dad” was never really in my life. My mom and him separated before I was a year old bcs he was abusive.
 
My mom always let me see him if I wanted BUT he didn’t want to see me. For a long time, he claimed my mom cheated on him and I wasn’t his. This was later disproved as me and my brother both share traits of him. I always tried to see him but he is a drug user and would be busy doing drugs with his friends. When I would see him, he would treat me like a friend rather than a son. I have only seen him around 10 times total. 

My older brother had a different relationship with him. He lived with him for a few years after getting expelled and since then maintained some sort of relationship.

At 16, I stopped trying to have a relationship with my “dad”. I realized what type of person he was and knew I was better off without him.

It is important to mention that I would see my grandma (his mom) often and she was always loving and supportive of me. I also have a younger brother and sister that are my “dad’s” children. I met that brother once but have met that sister a few times. 

At 18, my “dad” heard I was getting into acting and tried reaching out to me more. I was hesitant but decided to entertain this. I started to realize he wasn’t really interested in me but interested in what I was doing. He would ask me if I could “help him out in anyway.” He never directly asked me for money but I know that was what he wanted. At that point I was done with him and started ignoring him. 

My brother and him started to get closer, as they both love to rap. They would hang out and invite me over. I always declined. I found out more about him from my mom and decided I wanted nothing to do with him.

For the next few years I continued to ignore him. At 21, I got a call from my little sister. She told me something horrifying. She said that our “dad” had forced her to smoke (who knows what) and then wanted her to lay on the bed with him. She did smoke but knew better not to lay on the bed with him. She told her mom who called the police on him but he wasn’t arrested. She asked to live with me but I wasn’t able to take care of her. She ended up living with my grandma.

Now I am 23 and my “dad” has been trying to contact me more often than normal but I keep ignoring him. My brother tells me that he is dying from some disease he got from doing drugs and that I need to build a relationship with him before he dies. My grandma tells me that he doesn’t want to die without making amends and clearing his conscious. My mom says to do what I feel is right and supports me. 

AITA for not wanting to help clear his conscious before he dies?

Okay all that shit I can get over but what fucks with me the most is how he wears my clothes (I have 4 pants 12 shirts 3 hoodies 10 boxers ik im broke) so my clothes go missing for a min but on top of that he stole and sold all my expensive clothes on eBay. Not only that steals all my shit (jewelry, AirPods, money, ect.) on top of all that he picklocks the bathroom door and records me. he pulls down my pants and takes es pictures when I’m asleep.

I have a stepfather whom I’ve resented ever since I was 12 years old and we moved into his childhood home over a year ago. Ever since my mom and I moved here he’s been pushing to kick me out and my mom has been fighting for me every time. But now I’m just sick of living with him aswell. Since I been living here Ive tried my hardest to “please” him and reduce my presence within the home even doing the gardening, cleaning coming home late.  But after a little while his true colours start to show and his resentment towards me starts popping up. More recently I just stopped doin shit all together because I’ve been sick of the muttered words and the backhanded comments he can’t even say to my face. He’s like a ghost throwing insults at me. To be honest I’d be perfectly okay with it if there was reason but I don’t even know by he does it. Like why tf is a 45 year old man on my ass screaming until he bleeds about a bowl and a cup I left in my room. I’ll be fair I’m not a perfect guy, I take a little long to do chores wash dishes, clean room etc, but I think that’s no reason to fucking eat my ass out every day, especially because it GETS DONE. Anyway back to the point… ive recently stopped helping around the house because I wanted to see how much I’m actually needed in this household and what type of impact kicking me out would have. I’ve been coming home extra late like 10pm and leaving extra early. I stopped answering calls and overall barely existing in my house only to sleep and hygiene. As a result my lil brother hasn’t gone to school in like 2 weeks and gets picked up very late after school, the house is somewhat clean but it’s gets messy cus there’s no one to maintain it except my mother. Garbage isn’t thrown out, no eats, and no one to take care of my lil bro during the day. I’m aware this is super petty but honesty it’s worth listening to my mother grill my stepdick about how much of a larp he is. Am I the asshole?

More context:
-My stepfather is on disability because he has no kidneys, so he sleeps all day and wakes up angry 
-My mother works 6 days a week
-little bro in 2nd grade

TLDR:
Step father is a dick and wants me out his house, so I stop helping around my house and simulate what it’d be like if I was actually gone.

He tried to move back to his mother's house and she told him no because he is not responsible and has no intention of bein, so he asked my husband if he could move here, and I told him no, and I didn't tell him that because I'm bad or I don't love him, on the contrary, I adore him but he drives me crazy sometimes.

Before moving in alone he lived here and it was a nightmare. He never helped with cleaning or cooking, he always wanted me to cook for him, and sometimes he is mean to his sister. For example, last time he came to visit us he thought it was funny to tell our oldest daughter (3F)
that her dad never wanted to have daughters and that he was the favorite, and when she cried he just laughed, which made me quite angry because it's not the first time he's made her cry and he laughs. The thing is that he is angry because he says that this house is his dad's and not mine and that I don't have the right to decide, etc. My husband told him that it is also my house and that I can also decide but he is still angry and said horrible things to me, right AITA?

I sent a selfie to 5 of my friends, 2 of which are a couple (we’ll call them Dave and Sarah). Sarah opened the snap first, and said nothing out of the ordinary. For context, this picture was a snap of me from the neck up in a bikini. In no way was I showing off cleavage or flaunting anything. I am in a relationship myself. The 3 other friends also opened the snap and didn’t say anything different. Dave opened the snap, and asked me if it was meant for him. I was confused, and said yeah I mean I sent it to multiple people. He then told me he was uncomfortable because of the bikini I was wearing. I quickly apologized, as I did not mean to make him uncomfortable in any way. We were relatively close, and both sure in our own relationships. I was also very close with Sarah, his partner. After apologizing to Dave, I sent a message to Sarah saying “hey, I don’t know if Dave mentioned but I sent him that same snap I did you and it made him uncomfortable because of what I’m wearing, so I just wanted to apologize to you as well and reassure you it wasn’t a flirty thing and I sent the same picture to multiple people.” Sarah and Dave were both mad at me. And after a bit of going back and forth, I decided to stop talking to Dave so much because Sarah is a very possessive partner and I didn’t want my actions to be interpreted wrong. I also told them both although no one said anything directly about my body, it felt as though they had an issue with what I was wearing because it showed a bit of skin. My body is something I’m very insecure about, so I got upset. Eventually, Sarah and I both apologized for getting worked up, and I thought we were okay.

228,1d2a9pe,AITA for not going to the movies with my wife and her family?,"A little background: I am diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety in varying severity, and am on two medications for them. In general, I prefer to avoid large crowds or parties, but can have one-on-one interactions with most people.

My wife (31) and I (32) have been married for almost eight years, and we've had many conversations on how to best respond and act during family functions (for both sides of our family). Sometimes, everything works out fine. Other times, I will do my best to put on a smile, but when things get too noisy and I burn out, my true feelings show in the form of taking a nap, sitting quietly, or unintentionally being snappy or overly sarcastic. People will usually notice and then ask if I'm okay or, more often than not, ask my wife if I'm okay. This then leads to my wife and me talking about what went wrong on the drive home.

I usually put the blame on myself, but she'll also take blame for not giving me enough opportunities to step away to take a breather. The thing is I don't want to step away because I feel I'm being rude or I fear I may step away and not come back. Either way, I put myself in a catch-22.

In our recent conversations, my wife will give me as much of a heads up on events as she can so I can mentally prepare to go. However, the one caveat she often ends with is that if I don't feel like going, I should simply not go at all. Being the person I am, I find little fulfillment in attending most group activities in addition to struggling with attending in general, so I will almost always not feel like going. But trying to be the supportive husband, I try to show interest (or at least a lack of disinterest) in going.

This weekend, we have spent a lot of time with my wife's side of the family celebrating a high-school graduation and Memorial Day. I burnt out several times and would walk home midway through the events while my wife would stay. Our house is basically next door to where we were celebrating, so walking home was an easy and justifiable out.

Today, we said our goodbyes to most visiting family with just a few staying one more night. The remaining family invited us to go to the movies with them. Both my wife and I were ready to crash for the evening, but we accepted and started driving down to the theater. After a minute, my wife asks if I'm okay with going, to which I say, ""I'm going with the flow."" That was my way of saying I would prefer to stay home, but I'm willing to go. That caveat of ""don't go if you don't feel like going"" was again presented.

This time, I relented and turned the car around to be dropped off at home while she went to the theater. She was clearly unhappy with my decision, but I'm not sure if going and getting burnt out again would've presented a better result. 
AITA for staying home instead of going to the theater?",No A-holes here,2024-05-28,"AITA for not going to the movies with my wife and her family? A little background: I am diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety in varying severity, and am on two medications for them. In general, I prefer to avoid large crowds or parties, but can have one-on-one interactions with most people.

My wife (31) and I (32) have been married for almost eight years, and we've had many conversations on how to best respond and act during family functions (for both sides of our family). Sometimes, everything works out fine. Other times, I will do my best to put on a smile, but when things get too noisy and I burn out, my true feelings show in the form of taking a nap, sitting quietly, or unintentionally being snappy or overly sarcastic. People will usually notice and then ask if I'm okay or, more often than not, ask my wife if I'm okay. This then leads to my wife and me talking about what went wrong on the drive home.

I usually put the blame on myself, but she'll also take blame for not giving me enough opportunities to step away to take a breather. The thing is I don't want to step away because I feel I'm being rude or I fear I may step away and not come back. Either way, I put myself in a catch-22.

In our recent conversations, my wife will give me as much of a heads up on events as she can so I can mentally prepare to go. However, the one caveat she often ends with is that if I don't feel like going, I should simply not go at all. Being the person I am, I find little fulfillment in attending most group activities in addition to struggling with attending in general, so I will almost always not feel like going. But trying to be the supportive husband, I try to show interest (or at least a lack of disinterest) in going.

229,1d2a8zp,AITA for being “ungrateful” for an expensive education?,"I (17) attend a relatively small Christian boarding school and have just completed my junior year of high school. I was originally forced to go here my freshman year (2021-2022) after my mother found out I was gay. I’ve grown used to it and have integrated without loosing myself but, I am not comfortable attending the expensive school.

Recently I’ve realized here I often feel lonely as I only have one real friend and often feel only tolerated. I follow the rules and get good grades however being here has been negatively impacting my familial relationships. No one calls me or checks in on me however I’m told “the phone works both ways” whenever I tell them they can always reach out to me. 

Phones are taken during the day at the prison and I have little to no social literacy as we relocated during the pandemic and my phone was taken for four years prior to my attendance at the school (I have no friends in my state and just stay at home during breaks and the summer as I am not allowed a job or to go out without an adult) 

All that paired with the fact that I’m comfortable being the “low maintenance friend” (pretending everything’s fine when no one texts me over breaks when we get back on campus) means I rarely text people outside of the one friend I have and often go days without texting people and feeling no change in the relationship if the other person is fine with it.

Now the school is NOT cheap with a yearly fee of around 23k that my grandma pays as my family cant afford it. We are not rich or wealthy but my mother continues to live well beyond her means.

I have said multiple times I am perfectly fine not attending the school but my mother believes it is “what’s best for me” and allows my grandma to pay that absorbent fee for a quite frankly sub par education (public school would educate me more accurately and efficiently).

Whenever I “step out of line” or try to speak up for myself I am called disrespectful and ungrateful as my grandma has put down 69k at this point for this school and I cant even call her without asking for something (which is true for the most part as I’ve asked her for money on  two separate occasions as I needed hygiene items and an outfit for my prom and she is the only relative who answered me when I asked) . When I rebutdtaled that I never asked to go to the school and rarely ask for money as I don’t like asking for hand outs I am told “that’s not the point” and brushed off.

I truly am fine not interacting with people for weeks even months on end if they don’t text first. I don’t like bothering people which is probably part of the reason why I rarely text or call people in the first place and I’m not comfortable continuing to attend the school as I have really no life skills and it feels like I already have a massive debt I have to repay my grandma.

I probably sound extremely bratty and self centered but AITA?

230,1d2a4gu,AITA for choosing a guy over my best friend to go to prom with?,"My ex-bsf and I were best friends for over 3 years before a few weeks ago. For the past few months before prom, my ex-bsf and I kept telling each other that we would be going to prom together since clearly neither of us were getting asked by anyone anyway. We didn’t exactly make a solid plan except for that I was going to drive us since she didn’t have a car yet at the time. 

Fast-forward to about a month before prom, I was really starting to think about asking a guy that I knew to prom because I liked him and he was going to be sitting at our table anyway. I ask my friend group for their advice on whether or not I should ask him (which included her) and nobody seemed to be opposed to me asking him. So I ask this boy to prom and he says yes! This made me super excited because the guy that I liked actually wanted to go to prom with me. I tell all my friends about how he said yes when I asked him, and everyone was happy for me except for her. I knew her mood was off so I asked her if she was mad at me and she said that she was. 

Later that day I asked what part of it she was mad about and she started expressing how she felt as though we were committed to going together and that she felt that she wasn’t enough for me since I went and asked somebody else. She claimed that I was a shitty friend for “ditching” her for a guy. I repeatedly apologized to her and she kept going on being angry about it. It’s totally understandable to be mad about it, but completely ignoring my apologies and all attempts to have a mature conversation about it started to make me mad, too.

I really am not sure if I’m the asshole here, because on one hand, I did disregard the fact that we said we would go to prom together when I asked the guy.

Over the years dad has helped us out with money under the condition we pay him back, even if it’s detrimental to us, he insists on “payments” and he has always been paid even if it meant I ate ramen noodles that month. 

Now that dad has gotten to the end point of opening the business, the doors are about to open and he doesn’t want to run the place, so he believes that I, should be helping him every day, and that because he’s “helped” us in the past, despite insisting that every penny be repaid, that I should work for free, and quit my full time job because “that’s what family does” 

I also run a small jewelry business on the side for extra money, he believes that the money from the jewelry business should cover my household bills. 


My wife is working for my mother, who has a boutique next door to his store, under the stipulation that they pay one of our bills until moms business makes money, and then they can pay my wife “on the books” once they have paid for their inventory, this is fine because in my opinion in some round about way, she’s still getting paid. 

Dad has now started to ask her why I refuse to help, and why I refuse to quit my job to come run his store for free. 

Dad thinks he shouldn’t have to pay me, and that I should work there indefinitely without pay because of the times he’s helped us, everytime he brings this up I tell him that’s an asinine ask and ask him if he was in my shoes, if he would take that deal, and he says he would. 


I am not going to help dad for free, but have told him if he wants to pay me what I’m worth; I will gladly do whatever he wants done, when he hears that number, he immediately says “see after everything I’ve done for you you refuse to help me!

232,1d29wtz,"AITA for ""baiting"" my ex-fiance with ""nudes""?","Throwaway account.

Matt (now 30m) dumped me (now 23f) a few years ago. We had been engaged. I’d been in and out of inpatient and rehab treatment the months before the breakup, so I took it pretty hard.

We had a bad on-and-off situationship for almost 2 years after that before I ended it for good. This time it was civil; we made it clear that we’re still friends, but all the “benefits"" had to stop. 

6 months later, we still talk, hang out, spend an afternoon playing video games. Never anything more. A few times I did have to reaffirm boundaries, but he was just coming to terms with the fact that I meant it this time. In fairness, I had wavered on them before, & he struggled with me leading him on. But we figured it out, & we’ve been good friends. 

He’s also helping me get into photography, since that’s what his degree is in. Since we met he’s helped me learn Photoshop and how to use my camera. I’m learning portrait art now, and sometimes I take…artistic self-portraits. Then, I took a really good picture--I cropped my face out, edited the picture a few different ways—and holy crap, this picture seriously looked good. The issue? I was basically naked. A towel (and the way my legs were crossed) covered all the spicy parts, and my arm was positioned on my chest so that I could technically be on an album cover and not get censored. 

So, this is where I screwed up. I got the picture down to two different edits I liked. I was really torn between them, and I often send different photo versions to friends (Matt being the most frequent) and ask them to choose their favorites--but obviously I couldn’t send these to anybody. Except…maybe Matt? I started taking “artsy nudes” when we were still together, and he used to assist in editing them so I could save them in my private portfolio. So, it’s not like this would be anything new to him. Besides, the picture was pretty borderline; I was showing less than Katy Perry on that one album cover. That counts for something, right?

I was stupid, but I decided, screw it, I’ll give him a chance to prove that I can still trust him with this stuff. I texted him beforehand to ask for his artistic opinion on a portrait, warning him it was a nude. (exact words were “a little bit of tiddy”—I was trying to keep it lighthearted but I should’ve been clearer) Matt said he was cool with that, so I sent him the two different edits.

His response: “…you call that a titty pic?”

He was joking. But, I was pissy in my response and he accused me of baiting him into thinking he was going to get nudes.

To be fair, during one of the many “breaks” I’d called during the situationship, I’d “booty-called” him by sending spicy pics. But he’s now mad at me for leading him on, and I just think it’s a misunderstanding. I don’t want to lose him as a friend.

Raina could not get over Tim and would talk about him every day. Eventually, things started getting weird.

But then Raina started searching for Tim's family members on social media and started checking their posts every day to see new photos of him. 

Tim had a childhood friend, Winnie, and Raina despised her despite never meeting or talking to her. Raina then did the same to Winnie, searching for her social media and finding Winnie's family members' social media whilst checking on them every day. 

Then, Raina started following Tim around campus and taking pictures of him or Winnie from a distance. 

Raina continued talking about Tim all the time and we would all comfort her, but especially Layla. I stopped putting my two cents into the comforting when it had been seven months after the breakup and the stalking was weirding me out.

Raina not only talked about Tim to us but everyone she came across. Eventually, word got out to Tim that Raina was still stuck on him despite it being a year later and Tim told a mutual friend to tell Raina to leave him alone.

I blew up on her and told her it was getting out of hand from the fact that it was two years and she's still not over him and doesn't try but complains all the time about still being held up by it.

234,1d29vgi,AITA for getting my bestfriend kicked out of our sorority?,"Me (22f) was dating my on and off high school boyfriend Liam (22m) we had broken up for many reasons over the years but I felt like this time it might stick.

I was very excited for formal, Liam and I were ""off"" during prom so I never got that prom dress up nice, fairytale type feeling. My best friend in the sorority Jen (22f) didn't have a date so I let her tag along with me and Liam. Jen and I have been best friends since the beginning of college and rushed the sorority together she knew all about my past with Liam. I was having a great night until my professor sent me an email saying that he hadn't received my final paper even though I had submitted it two days ago. It was worth most of my grade so I was freaking. Liam was with me through most of it but honestly I was most concerned with me not failing so I asked Jen to keep an eye on him while I sorted it all out. In the end it all got sorted out and enjoyed the rest of our night. 

A few weeks went by and we had our elections for sorority board and I ended up being voted President. I was so excited and was looking forward to Senior year everything seemed perfect. Liam was over and I get a text from Jen she wanted to talk and she said it was urgent. I called her right away, I asked her if everything was alright with her family I honestly thought someone had died. She begins to tell me that she is so so sorry, I say sorry for what. Then she lets it all out apparently at formal while I was handling everything Liam gives Jen his phone number. Tells her if she ever needs anything to give him a call. My gut instantly drops. One of the reasons that Liam and I were on and off in high school was because he was never faithful but he promised that now he was which is why I took him back. She goes on to tell me that she texted him when she was moving out of her dorm for the summer, to thank him she took him for dinner, and something happened. I was furious I asked her why she didn't tell me at formal that he had given her his number? She said she thought he was just being friendly which is why she reached out. I said there is no way she is that naïve and  hang up. Obviously that was the end of my relationship with Liam. But I was so mad and felt so betrayed. So at the beginning of the school year I went to the rules of membership in our sorority and figured out a way to kick Jen out I never wanted to see her face again. So I called a board meeting had the letter drawn up and delivered it myself face to face. When I went to drop it of Liam answered the door apparently the had been dating all summer. I dropped the letter and ran blocked both of them form everything and haven't heard or seen either since.",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-28,"AITA for getting my bestfriend kicked out of our sorority? Me (22f) was dating my on and off high school boyfriend Liam (22m) we had broken up for many reasons over the years but I felt like this time it might stick.

I was very excited for formal, Liam and I were ""off"" during prom so I never got that prom dress up nice, fairytale type feeling. My best friend in the sorority Jen (22f) didn't have a date so I let her tag along with me and Liam. Jen and I have been best friends since the beginning of college and rushed the sorority together she knew all about my past with Liam. I was having a great night until my professor sent me an email saying that he hadn't received my final paper even though I had submitted it two days ago. It was worth most of my grade so I was freaking. Liam was with me through most of it but honestly I was most concerned with me not failing so I asked Jen to keep an eye on him while I sorted it all out. In the end it all got sorted out and enjoyed the rest of our night. 

A few weeks went by and we had our elections for sorority board and I ended up being voted President. I was so excited and was looking forward to Senior year everything seemed perfect. Liam was over and I get a text from Jen she wanted to talk and she said it was urgent. I called her right away, I asked her if everything was alright with her family I honestly thought someone had died. She begins to tell me that she is so so sorry, I say sorry for what. Then she lets it all out apparently at formal while I was handling everything Liam gives Jen his phone number. Tells her if she ever needs anything to give him a call. My gut instantly drops. One of the reasons that Liam and I were on and off in high school was because he was never faithful but he promised that now he was which is why I took him back. She goes on to tell me that she texted him when she was moving out of her dorm for the summer, to thank him she took him for dinner, and something happened. I was furious I asked her why she didn't tell me at formal that he had given her his number? She said she thought he was just being friendly which is why she reached out.

235,1d29v02,AITA for reading my husband's journal and getting upset about it?,"My husband (33m) and I (33f) have been married for 11 years (together for 14). We have two kids together, 11m and 8f. 

When my daughter was a baby, I was browsing our shared computer and came across a document titled ""Journal"". My husband was in the room so I joked with him that I found it and that I was going to read it. He shrugged and said that I could go ahead, that he has no secrets from me. I got excited and started reading through it. I found an entry from when my daughter was about 10 weeks old that talked about how much he hated being a father to our two kids, how exhausted he was with all of his responsibilities, and how he wished he had known what he was getting into before he got married and had kids. He also said that he wished I was more motivated and that I worked out more.

I was understandably heartbroken and asked him why he would write that and why he'd let me read it. He said that he had forgotten about that entry, but it wasn't how he felt anymore. He chalked it up to having been sleep deprived because of a newborn and sex deprived because of my needing to heal after childbirth. We had a big argument about it with a lot of tears on my part, but we managed to move through it together.

Now, 8 years later, I still can't stop thinking about that entry, especially any time he seems grouchy with me or the kids. I have brought it up to him over the years as something that still gives me pause about his commitment to our family and his attraction to me. He gets angry whenever I bring it up and asks when I will stop holding that over his head. 

Looking back, I know I shouldn't have read it, even with his permission. These days, I am the main breadwinner of the family and I do everything I can to take burdens off of him when I'm able to. I've also done a lot to try to make our lives exciting, like taking us to Hawaii for our 10th anniversary and taking the family to Disney World. However, the past few years I have had significant medical issues that have impacted my mobility and resulted in me having 5 different surgeries on my legs in the past 3 years, so a lot of the housework and physical tasks have fallen to him. I can tell he is overwhelmed with the responsibility of maintaining our home and our lives, but there is little that I can physically to do help these days.

I've also gained even more weight now than I had back then. He has gained weight too, so we are in the same boat. But I can't stop shaking the feeling that he wished that his life would have turned out differently and feels trapped in this family.  I recently lost my dad and needed a lot of emotional support and he was so obviously resentful of having to be there for me while also working full time, which makes me wonder if he still feels the same. 

Am I the asshole for being upset about his journal and still having doubts about it to this day?

Update: 
I appreciate all of the comments, there have been some good insights. I want to clarify a few things that weren't clear in the original post:
1. When I read the journal, my daughter was only a couple of months old and I was a sahm potty-training and pre-schooling my oldest and nursing my youngest. This was absolutely the hardest time of my life, I had ppd and was very lonely and exhausted all of the time. We were also all living on my husband's income, which was only $14/hr at the time, so I spent a lot of time at food banks and getting us other benefits like WIC and food stamps.
2. I haven't brought it up constantly in our marriage. It's been mentioned a handful of times, only when there was something that happened that brought up the insecurity for me, but he was very sensitive about it (understandably so), so I haven't brought it up in a long time. I don't harp on him about it so much as I internalize it. We are both in therapy separately and I definitely wouldn't read his journal now, or interrogate him about his therapy or anything else like that.
3. My medical issues are a big part of why I am insecure about this, it's hard not to see myself as a burden. Our roles have shifted so dramatically since then. I brought up me being the main breadwinner because it's what I go to to remind myself that I contribute a lot to our family. He still makes roughly the same as he did back then and now I make roughly 6 figures, but he does much more of the housework. Now that the kids are older, parenting is much less difficult, but it still means he has more responsibility now than he did then between working full time and housework (which I used to do all of), but we don't hurt for money anymore. I worry that it's all too much for him and I'm constantly trying to figure out how I can do more. We have always shared finances so we don't think about it as my money vs. your money, so it's not something I hold over him at all, especially since he has been the breadwinner in the past.
4. He is an amazing husband and I love him more than anything, ever. We have been together since I was 18 and he was 19, and we had kids honestly probably too young, but we have grown together and built a life beyond what we had growing up and I'm so grateful for it. I think the journal brought up a lot of my personal insecurities and it's something my mind just pops back to whenever we are struggling, but we really do have a great relationship.  Our kids are amazing and just continue to be more awesome the older they get. 

I don't mind being told I'm the asshole in this situation at all, it honestly helps to have outside confirmation that my feelings are irrational because I'd rather not feel the way I do. Please continue to leave comments and I will be as open-minded to them as I possibly can.

236,1d29rxs,AITA for refusing to go to my parents wedding?,"Ok, I'm actually looking for some serious advice here because IDK what to do.

I (**17F**) am about to go into my senior year of high school. My parents are divorced, I live with my mom a majority of the time and occasionally I stay with my dad and his girlfriend who recently got engaged. 

My dad and I have always had a weird relationship, Consistently my dad has chosen his partners over me in the past, so I have never really gotten close with him.  The problem lies with his girlfriend who I'll call Bee.

About a year ago, I decided to take a break from staying with them because when I would be over there, Bee was constantly scolding me for being 5 minutes later than she told me to be home, for wearing baggy clothing, OR the fact that my room had a single sock on the floor that wasn't put in the laundry basket. (That may sound like I'm exaggerating but Bee made me stay home from hanging out with my friends to do a whole load of all of the family socks to ""show how important small details are"" OVER A SOCK) 

The actual issue started a couple of months ago when they got engaged. My dad had asked me before if I was okay with it, and I told him that no matter what I said he was going to do it anyway. And he did. They got engaged and immediately started figuring out a date for the wedding.

(I don't want to share either the date or the meaning as it is very specific to my family and I can already see myself getting in more trouble than I already am for this post, LOL)

So, this morning, I saw Bee planning some dates, and I decided to ask what date she decided on. IT IS THE DAY AFTER MY GRADUATION. I just sat in disbelief. She assured me that it would be fine. That this was the perfect date for their wedding, and as I tried to argue with the fact that it would mean either my family would miss my graduation, that I WOULD MISS MY GRADUATION, or everyone, including myself, would have to miss my dad's wedding. I told her that she and my dad would have to live with the fact that if they chose that date, I would not be attending. She told me that wasn't fair, that I could easily fly out early the next morning to arrive right before the wedding, I tried to explain to her that it wasn't as simple as that. It would mean that MY DAD wouldn't be there to watch me graduate. My dad just sat at the table, telling me to watch my mouth or that I was overreacting. So I said, ""Fine, I'll make sure that I can be at your next wedding though."" Bee's mouth dropped and my dad yelled at me to go to my room. So I did. 

I feel like I was out of line for commenting on my dad's hypothetical; ""next wedding"", but I don't know. I'm very hurt and confused and I genuinely don't know if I'm just acting like a bratty teenager. Soooo...
