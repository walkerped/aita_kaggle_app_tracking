41F and my friend is a 42F. Went swimming with a friend yesterday. We had gone shopping the day before and my friend had gotten a cute dress. While we were lounging, I raved about my friend’s dress and how good it looked on her. She was a little self conscious because she’s well-endowed and it wasn’t really covering her chest the way she wanted.

Late in the afternoon, after I tried to help her adjust the straps to no avail, she turned to me and said, “I don’t think it’s going to work for me, would you like it since you don’t have any boobs.”

I’m a transwoman (and a relatively new one) and my friend has always known that I struggle with body image issues, particularly about the size of my chest. After she said it, I let me friend know the remark stung a little and that it had hurt my feelings. I didn’t get loud or rude, I just calmly stated it without making it a big deal.

My friend proceeded to rip me apart and tell me how I was overly sensitive and couldn’t take a joke. She told me how ridiculous I was being and how she wouldn’t apologize because she has seen me say mean things about people (not to them, just about them).

I’m hurt and confused. I tried to just let the issue go, but honestly it makes me feel really insecure being around my friend and I feel like she doesn’t really care how her words or actions impact me.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-05-28,"AITA - Feelings Got Hurt, Friend Says I Have No Bewbs AITA

Not gonna say it’s not at all my fault but no 5 year old was eating enough to be 145 lbs ya know? I’m also chronically ill and disabled.

 My dad has always been. Well he’s been. He’s supported me and my mother financially as well as he could by working as a long haul trucker since I was about 6. So he was never really around and I never developed a true relationship with my dad. Now my dads “love language” is teasing and poking fun at you and while I can take it to a certain extent I’ve tried to make it clear that we don’t have the type of relationship where I’m okay with him making fat jokes at my expense.

 His comments do hurt me deeply and I’ve tried to make that clear without being a jerk but he always ignores me or calls me sensitive. On top of that he refuses to use my proper name and pronouns since coming out but I’m not gonna fight him on that. Still hurts tho. Well this last week he was “teasing” me about my snack choices and basically I told him to “f*ck off” about my eating habits. I guess that hurt his feelings and now I’m being guilt tripped by my mom and grandma. The same ones who’ve watched me sob and ask why my dad hates me so much. Anyway. AITA or should I apologize?

4,1d29nnz,AITA for refusing to return someone’s car keys,"Some friends and I went to the lake for Memorial Day. I prepared a lot of snacks, drinks, and other things so we have whatever we could need for a lake day. One of the people in our group, let’s call him Jake, brought nothing. Nada! He didn’t even know if he should bring a swimsuit or a towel! The only thing he did was drive us to the lake. We met up with some other friends there and we all got settled in. Jake and friend #1 began drinking, heavily. We were supposed to leave by 3pm. That was the hard cut off time to leave the lake what we all agreed to. 
When 3 came around, we began to pack up. My friend and Jake  got invited to go on a strangers boat at that time. I told them we are leaving and they decided to stay behind. My friend came up to our tent area and took her and Jake’s stuff to friend #2, who got there later than us. Me and the others packed up and left. It’s important to note that there is no signal at the lake. When I got home, I unpacked and I found  Jake’s keys in my bag. I never put those keys in my bag. I didn’t know those keys were in my bag. I tried getting in touch with the friends still at the lake to tell them I had his keys but I didn’t get a response.
I got frustrated because I wasn’t the one who got drunk and got on some strangers boat. I don’t think I should be responsible for Jake’s lack of planning as well as extreme drunkenness. I had a lot of work to do when I got home from the lake so I wasn’t  going to go back and give him the keys. I also think giving the keys back would have been a terrible idea since friend #1 and Jake were intoxicated. 
Friend #2 was there was the only one who could get ahold of me. She asked me to bring the keys and I replied that I wouldn’t. I also should note friend #2 took an Uber to the lake with her friends and they didn’t have a ride back. She got angry at me for not coming back. I told her that she should get an Uber or ask someone to take them. Eventually, friend #1 and Jake were able to get a ride from a stranger. I met them to give Jake’s keys back. They were then able to go back to the lake from another friend’s sister and get Jake’s car. 
Now Jake and friend #2 is angry at me. Friend #1 knows that the situation was frustrating for all of us and isn’t mad at me. I could have gone back, but to me, it’s the principle.

5,1d29bw3,AITA for telling my (ex) best friend my opinion about her (ex) boyfriend?,"This is a long story made very short! Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.

I (F18) have been best friends with a girl we will call Ally (F17) for 15 years. Ally and I have always been very close friends and our biggest flex was that we never fought.

However, when Ally and her (now ex) boyfriend (M17) got together, things changed. This is expected of course and I have been in a relationship for three years so I understand the adjustment. But, when Ally got a job, she spent all of her free time with her boyfriend. The time she did spend with me consisted of constant complaining about how tired she was and how she never got to see her boyfriend. I never got to hear anything else about her life. Despite Ally always talking down on girls who ditched their best friends for their boyfriends, she was now that girl, so we drifted a lot.

It was like this for a few months. During the peak of this, Ally went on a trip and returned to a nasty break-up text from her boyfriend. She immediately texted me for support, which I provided as I knew how much she loved him despite her distancing herself from me.

This is when it all goes downhill really fast. My high school graduation was now here and my boyfriend was kind enough to take her as his ""date"" to our events. The whole time she was mopey about her ex and how he was there but she could not talk to him. A week later, she was messaging me about how her ex was the only one who was there for her. I said ""Well I am here for you just as much"" and she flipped out and claimed I did not know anything that was going on in her private life and that I never noticed her crying at school. Keep in mind, that we have not spoken for months but I still loved her just as much. I apologized and said I did not know how she was feeling and all that, as I was truly sorry.

A month later, Ally asked me, unprompted, what my opinions were on her ex and if they should get back together. I have never spoken my mind about him, or anything really, to her, and even now I restrained myself. I said, ""He has done some bad things and has hurt you, so I am not sure"". And she lost it. She said that she knew I would respond like this and that I never supported her. Since this, things have been tense and awkward. I moved away for university, and she has barely cared. She has confronted me about how she has been feeling but does not seem to want to fix anything, just picks a fight.

6,1d29b8j,AITA for not paying for my girlfriend's rent (Financial responsibilities in a relationship),"Apologies for wordiness, as this includes both the issue in the title as well as some more general, related incidents.

My (25M) girlfriend (26F) of three years is going to be moving into a summer sublease next week. We looked at a few places for her and she was split between two places in the same town. One is a room in a shared house with 2 other people (co-ed) and the other is a studio apartment that costs 60 more per month. She thought that the studio would be more comfortable and make her feel safer than living in a co-ed space with strangers for roommates, but really did not want to pay the extra 60 dollars per month. I wanted her to feel safer so I offered to cover the additional 60 for her so that she would not have to have such a tough decision, while also helping me feel more secure with her living situation. She was pretty happy about this arrangement and signed the lease.

She recently had a conversation with a new friend (who I don't know very well) and told her friend that I was helping her cover 60 dollars of her 800 dollar rent. Her friend apparently scoffed at her and said ""Only 60""? Now she is upset at me because she says that I'm being cheap/stingy for only covering 60 dollars of her rent, where a ""good boyfriend"" (according to her friend) should cover at least 100 dollars, if not half to all of the rent. She says that since I would be coming over to help her out and to hang out at her place, I should be paying more since I would be using the space too. 

I told her that I thought that was a stupid reason and that she should be grateful that I'm even covering any rent at all for her, since I won't be living there (I currently pay rent to my parents to live with them, since I am working part time and studying full-time at my graduate program, and can't realistically afford to move out at the moment). This spiraled our conversation into something else. She began to say that if she ever needed to count on me to pay for her, I'd be useless. She brought up a recent vacation she took with some friends, where she was a few hours late to arrive to her destination because her flight was delayed and she did not want to pay a hundred plus to change flights. She said that she can't count on me to pay for her changed flight. I am confused because I feel like it shouldn't be my responsibility to help her change a flight so that she can get to her vacation (which I was not a part of) a few hours earlier. I want to be a good boyfriend to her, but I honestly do not know whether things like this are a part of a boyfriend's ""normal"" responsibilities or if she is trying to take advantage of me. 

TLDR: Girlfriend is mad that I am not paying for more of her rent (for an apartment that I will not be living at). Girlfriend has been resentful of me for similar situations of me being stingy/cheap. I am kind of stupid and don't really know if these sorts of expenses are normal for a boyfriend to cover, but feel like I'm not in the wrong here.

He's reserved, but he cares a lot about the family and works hard to support us. He does have a few conservative opinions, but it's more a culture thing than anything else. He wants me to go to college.

A few months ago I was forcibly outed as queer to him, and it shocked him so much that he essentially told me to get out, after an uncharacteristic screaming match and fight. Whatever happened, I absolutely injured him too, and I regret it. I did get out, and I've been living with my aunt (28) since. He hasn't contacted me at all, which is upsetting because we had such a good relationship. This came out of nowhere.

I don't know if he knows where I am, or what I'm doing, or what's going to become of my future. Insane how quickly he threw away 16 years of investment. He was even ready to pay for my college. I've tried talking to him so many times, but he doesn't respond to any messages or calls. Apparently he's told my sister not to contact me anymore.

While he was at work last week, my sister invited me over (against his wishes) to pick up some of my things. I've been gradually moving out. Purely on impulse, I took the only picture of my dead grandfather he had, hanging on the kitchen wall. My dad was very close to his father, and was devastated when he died. My grandfather, living in extreme poverty, saved enough to send my dad to college and struggled all his life for his kids. One of the few times I've ever seen my dad show real emotion was when he hung up this picture. So it was probably needlessly cruel of me to take it, though it was satisfying.

My sister says my dad actually cried after he saw the picture was gone. I don't know if it's from stress or this, and I don't think he knows I was the one who took it. She says he's still searching for it when he gets the time. If I return it now he will no doubt try to fight again and all hope of him ever talking to me again would be out the window.

9,1d293sb,AITA for eating leftovers before my narcissistic dad could? ," For extra insight into this, I, (19F) and my mom, (56F), just got back from a concert that happened last night when we spent the night over in another city. 

 We got back this afternoon after we had lunch and hung out with some friends who also went to said concert and when we got back we had two trays of food from our respective plates. Flash forward to about four hours later and I finally get up to eat my plate of food, only for my dad to get up from the couch at the same time and say he wanted food too. He waited until I plated the food and then put it in the microwave to start talking to my (24F) autistic sister to thank her for saving food for him. I didn’t hear what he was saying and gave a laugh at something I’d knocked over and he proceeded to look directly at me and say, “Yeah the one smirking over there.” Referring to me. 

 I was stunned, though I should have expected this as he does things of this caliber all the time, repeatedly and it’s caused a strain on my parent’s marriage for about two decades now. I proceeded to ask him directly if he wanted food, though he was already making some of his own and had already said earlier that he didn’t want any, anyways. 

 This back and forth had me seething in moments, I admit, and I was very aggressive each time I replied to him, and he went as far to just all together deny he ever said he declined my offer. That led to a stand off, where I left my food in the microwave as it was heating up and left to cool my head. I came back only when we went outside to feed our animals and snuck away like I’d done something bad. I wouldn’t have felt like I had to make a post, but he even checked the microwave to see if I’d left the food and slammed the door when he didn’t find it. I’m sick to my stomach, and this isn’t the first time he’s made me feel like this. 

 Am I the asshole for eating my own food my mother bought for me and blowing it out of proportion, or is there something I should be worried about? 

edit: I want to clarify how I just want some closure for how I feel and some insight as to what could be wrong with me or my father. If it’s a relationship thing or if it’s something else. I should also add, it was not just one question to me and I was angry, it was a slew of “well I said I was hungry,” and “I didn’t say I didn’t want any food,” from my father. I really enjoy the feedback that he could be joking, but by no means has my relationship with my father ever been normal and he cannot even hug me normally, if that provides any more insight into how messed up our relationship is.

11,1d28yud,AITA: A Woman and her Husband Walk into a Restaurant…,"Well…not quite like that. For context: my husband and I are on our honeymoon - today is the first day. I unfortunately am in a bad financial space and until a deposit enters my account (tomorrow) I only have $15 to my name - my husband knows this and just a few days ago expressed anger at me that we might not be able to do things on the trip because my financial situation is holding us back. I reiterated to him that once I get paid (after the first day) I will have more than enough to cover the trip and fun experiences.

 Fast forward to today (first day)- a local woman recommends a particular restaurant. Husband had looked it up previously and agreed he wanted to go so I was up for it too. Irregardless of the price, I wanted to go because I didn’t want him to miss out on a nice dinner bc I couldn’t afford it. For reference, we have always paid separately for things and it works for us. So my husband drops me off at the restaurant and circles the block to park. Meanwhile, I get us a table and look at the menu. The following text exchange then takes place:
 
Me: the cheapest starter here is $28. This is a nice place..
H: ok. Too much? Open to other fish options nearby
Me: I’m already sitting down - you can come and eat :) I just prob won’t get anything 
H: Well then find another option cheap pants 🙂 it’s just food…I just want fish
Me: I feel really awkward now bc a couple people have helped me and poured us water. Hahah
H: Run away?
Me: just get here when you can and we can decide. The menu looks good!

Again - given our previous convo, I just wanted him to see the menu so as not to miss out on a nice meal just bc I couldn't. So he enters the restaurant and sits down/starts observing the menu. I tell him again that I’m not getting anything but he’s more than welcome to. He then starts shaking his head and says “We take this $6k trip and then this…”. (Side note - all of this was paid for by wedding gift $). I’m now starting to get upset. The waiter walks back up to take our order and he orders a small dish and a drink. I kindly decline to order anything. Now my husband is visibly upset with me and won’t talk to me, though I am attempting convo with him. He said he was more uncomfortable with just him ordering than he would have been just getting up and leaving. I told him I gave him the out but I wanted him to see the menu. We awkwardly sat there for the next 20 minutes while he ate his meal and then left. 

This then escalated into a huge argument, him saying I should have left before he got there and me saying I wish he would have told me that he wasn’t going to want anything if I didn’t order anything. Again, given our previous convo, I didn’t want him to miss out just bc of my financial situation. Replaying again and again, I can’t figure out what I would have done different. AITA?

UPDATE: I've gotten a lot of ESH feedback so I appreciate the opinions! What I could have done differently is looked at the menu before going in and letting him know that I wouldn't get anything.

Hi reddit! 
    So first off; my fiance and I are newly engaged as of January and we have a very loving relationship. In fact we HARDLY ever argue or fight about things, he and I are exact opposites in personality but have the same interests. 2 years ago, we opened up a small business and run the business from our home. We use a computer my fiance built from his gaming days that he had been using in his music studio. He is a producer, but has been taking a break. Well as of this year my Fiance has been requesting we purchase a business computer or use my laptop from college  to use for our small business so he can return back to his music and gaming. I have no problem with that and would love to see him make music again, however as of right now it isn't in our business funding to purchase a new computer and he's told me he understands that we need to save up for it. Well this is now May almost June and the computer has been a discussion every other week. Where he reminds me he wants his computer and I remind him we need to save up or purchase a new one from our personal accounts.    
     Beginning this tax season, My Fiance and I agreed for him to take care of the books since he wanted to be involved in the financing, going against the fact I have a degree in business and am educated in the accounting and filing department well enough to be able to create a ledger. Any ways, today I brought up the fact the expense report, the sales, etc. Basically the entire ledger hasn't even been started yet and they NEED done and that he agreed for responsibility of those items. I gave him til the end of this month (4 days) to get it done so I can get an idea of where we are as a business for this year. He didn't like that I gave him an ultimatum,  so he brought up the computer. He said he doesn't understand how I can give him an ultimatum on reports if he hasn't given me an ultimatum on the computer. Shortly after our argument, he left for his parents for a memorial day get together and I stayed to work on business stuff (orders that came in earlier). 
     While he was gone, I unhooked his computer and put it in his man cave for him, and now have my college laptop set up in the office area. However the problem is I was in college a long time ago, this laptop is from 2014 and I'm 28 years old. So it's very outdated which my fiance knew before all of this and was aware that's why we needed to just purchase a new desktop. He came back home to me sitting on the laptop trying to just open our email, I had been waiting for an hour already for the laptop to just update after powering on.  We got into a huge fight after that and he says I wanted to make him feel sorry for me by swapping the computer out for my laptop, which isn't true. I told him I'm sick of hearing about the computer when he knows why we haven't got a new one yet. AITA for being so stubborn about the situation?",Asshole,2024-05-28,"AITA for being stubborn?

Also I don't want to talk overly bad about Ella to my friends because that's so humbling.) Something to note is that during the relationship, she cared a lot who I spoke to. 

While Ella and I were together she came to a couple of parties with friends of mine but mostly kept to herself so she never established friendships with any of my friends. We do share one close mutual friend, “Polly” who originally introduced us and who we are both still on good terms with.

This was the first time that Ella and Christine properly met, and they seemed to get along. Ella started making plans for them to hang out later this week in front of me and Polly which we both thought was rude since they were talking across Polly and didn't make any effort to include her.

For reference my friend Christine is straight and Ella has a new girlfriend so this is a platonic hangout.

basically i grew up in a very strict cuban household. My dads emotionally abusive n is constantly manipulating me and my mother. he’s cheated on her multiple times n prohibits her from working and doing certain things (long story short he’s controlling tf outta her). my mom knows of this behavior as he treats her like shit yet she never says anything. 

my dad is a control freak n doesn’t let me do ANYTHING. i can’t have my phone after 12, can’t close the door when i have friends over, can’t go out w my friends even if their parents are going (either my friends go out w us or i don’t see them), can’t join any sports in school simply because he “doesn’t want me to”, finds literally everything disrespectful (hugged my man infront of him n he said i need to have some self respect), etc etc. my breaking point was yesterday. 

my parents had invited my bf to come w us to the beach since we go every year. mind u my bf is a very respectful person who has done nothing but treat my family very nicely yet they somehow find a way to talk shit abt him. we had nicely asked if we could sleep in the same bed (there’s 2 beds in the hotel room n i have a brother. my parents had brought the air mattress for my bf to sleep in, but we rlly wanted to sleep in the same bed n didn’t see the harm in it as we js wanted to cuddle eachother comfortably until we fell asleep) n my parents LOST IT. they made it a huge deal n called me various names (disrespectful ones too) saying that i have no self respect n im a whore, simply because i wanted to sleep w my bf. 

my dad then proceeded to stay up ALL NIGHT watching my bf like a hawk to see if one of us would go to eachothers bed. it was very disturbing. not only that, my mom also took it upon herself to take my bfs PHONE and put it on the tv table infront of him, which is also disrespectful. on the way back home after dropping my bf off at his house they proceeded to tell me that if i lose my virginity ill get kicked out. don’t know how we went from falling asleep w my bf in the same bed to me losing my virginity, but ok. 

i already lost my virginity (YES YES IK IM ONLY 15) so im debating if i should tell them n see what happens. i know how this seems like he is just trying to protect me, but please understand that my father is a very controlling abusive man with a bad history. it’s one thing to be protective and another to be borderline controlling. there are times where i dont even feel safe in this house.",Asshole,2024-05-28,"AITA for wanting to leave my house at 15 years old?

my dad is a control freak n doesn’t let me do ANYTHING. i can’t have my phone after 12, can’t close the door when i have friends over, can’t go out w my friends even if their parents are going (either my friends go out w us or i don’t see them), can’t join any sports in school simply because he “doesn’t want me to”, finds literally everything disrespectful (hugged my man infront of him n he said i need to have some self respect), etc etc. my breaking point was yesterday. 

my parents had invited my bf to come w us to the beach since we go every year. mind u my bf is a very respectful person who has done nothing but treat my family very nicely yet they somehow find a way to talk shit abt him. we had nicely asked if we could sleep in the same bed (there’s 2 beds in the hotel room n i have a brother. my parents had brought the air mattress for my bf to sleep in, but we rlly wanted to sleep in the same bed n didn’t see the harm in it as we js wanted to cuddle eachother comfortably until we fell asleep) n my parents LOST IT. they made it a huge deal n called me various names (disrespectful ones too) saying that i have no self respect n im a whore, simply because i wanted to sleep w my bf. 

my dad then proceeded to stay up ALL NIGHT watching my bf like a hawk to see if one of us would go to eachothers bed. it was very disturbing. not only that, my mom also took it upon herself to take my bfs PHONE and put it on the tv table infront of him, which is also disrespectful. on the way back home after dropping my bf off at his house they proceeded to tell me that if i lose my virginity ill get kicked out. don’t know how we went from falling asleep w my bf in the same bed to me losing my virginity, but ok. 

i already lost my virginity (YES YES IK IM ONLY 15) so im debating if i should tell them n see what happens. i know how this seems like he is just trying to protect me, but please understand that my father is a very controlling abusive man with a bad history. it’s one thing to be protective and another to be borderline controlling. there are times where i dont even feel safe in this house.",1.0,-0.012706611,0,0
16,1d28m9v,AITA for telling my friend I don’t want to have child friendly meet ups anymore,"My friend Daisy (32F) and I (33F) are both child less and meet up regularly for coffee or lunch. Daisy has a 3 year old niece who she babysits often and now that she’s of the age she can take out more easily she’s started bringing her to our meet ups. 

Initially I assumed this was just an occasional thing when she wasn’t going to be available to meet up otherwise so I didn’t mind too much. It was a bit of a novelty at first and I like children. However this became a regular thing eventually and the meet ups became more and more child orientated, with the timings and location dictated by what was best for her niece. And also during the whole time together it was inevitably taken over by Daisy’s niece’s needs, her being sleepy, hungry, thirsty, needing the toilet, getting upset, playing up etc. All normal expected stuff from a child, but not normal for two child less women to revolve their meet ups around and it started to basically feel like I was getting tricked into babysitting as well in all my social time. 

Eventually recently when Daisy messaged about meeting up at a cafe next to her niece’s nursery so that she can pick her up and meet me there I replied saying it might be better if we tried to meet at the times she’s not babysitting so that she can enjoy the time as well and can keep her time with her niece as quality time with her. 

She replied back annoyed and seemingly angry saying children aren’t something you can just put aside and that she doesn’t have time to meet without her niece, and then asked me what will I do when I have children of my own, which is utterly bizarre as it’s not the same comparison. 

Additional Info - I know Daisy’s brother personally too and he has a very good marriage and they adore their child. From what I’ve gathered since their daughter was born Daisy has been doting on her and wants to babysit all the time as she loves to spend time with her, so it’s not like she’s required to because they are neglectful or anything. And of course that’s completely fine, it’s just the bringing to all our social meets and acting like she’s the mother that has no choice that’s getting a bit odd.

17,1d28m2j,AITA if I don’t let my brother see my kids without speaking to me first?," My (34M) family and I are traveling back to our home state next week. My wife and I have two girls (3 and 1), and this will be the second maybe 3rd trip home since having our first child. My brother (28M) and I aren’t currently on speaking terms. Long story short, on my first daughter’s first birthday I snapped at my mom for talking shit about my wife in front of me while opening presents. The reason was because my wife was not in the room while we were opening presents. She had her reasons, but ultimately she agreed she should have been there. 
I myself was relatively was overwhelmed by the day and everything that came along with having two sets of parents visiting simultaneously. I told her that if she was going to keep talking shit about my wife in front of me, she could leave. She was speaking about my wife, the major difference being attention was definitely on me. My brother defended my mom and I quickly reacted and told him he could leave as well. 
Sometime went by and my mom, my brother, his girlfriend, and his father all decided to leave early. My wife found out and chased them out to try to get them to stay. I then heard they were leaving, went outside and all hell broke loose. It almost came to blows between my brother and I, because he was enraged. He said a lot of things you can’t un-say and neither of us have spoken since. 
Fast forward, we are going home for my second daughters 1st birthday and he wants to see them. He didn’t call me, he told my mom and his dad and they approached me about it. They thought that his dad could take my wife and I out to dinner, and while my mom watched the girls he could come by. I said no. That if he wants to see them he needs to speak to me first. Idc about discussing the incident, what I want to make sure is that if he plans on coming into their lives that he has every intention in staying in them. For the last 2 years he hasn’t been, and I’m not interested in my girls only being payed attention to when it’s convenient for him. If he can promise me that regardless of our relationship that he will still make me effort to be in theirs I am ok with him being apart of their lives. But that this visit I still don’t feel comfortable with it, because they are young and I believe they would be to shy around him and just freak out. They do it with a lot of our guy friends who they are around all the time. Mainly though, my wife and I are uncomfortable with it and don’t want to be adding more stress on to the trip.

But by the time Friday came, I was back at school, and it was the day of the presentation. I asked the girl and Debbie if they had finished their part of the slideshow, and they laughed at my face. Why? Because they decided on changing our subject of our project and made one themselves last minute without informing me in anyway, as well as deleted all the 4 hours of research and work I had already put into the original project. Now something to note, is that I am someone with a very short temper, especially when it comes to things like this, but over the years, I have learned to control it.

I ""23M"" met a girl ""23F"" when I was younger ( when I was 18 ~ 19 years old ) 
The bond between us became unique since the first text 
At this time she was in a relation with a guy that was kinda toxic to her, and I tried to help her in that relationship, when we were talking it was like we were made for each other 

Well i will keep it simple here, a year passed I fell in love for her and she for me but, we were living at 200km from each other. 

And one night she asked me if I was Ok that she goes out with her friends for a party, I was not the type of dude to block her everything, but I had a feeling that she shouldn’t be going to that particular party and I said no but she went and after some glasses she called me saying that her ex ( the toxic one ) called her and wanted to try again their relation and she accepted, I was devasted she was honestly the girl I loved from deep down my soul and after that they got back together I remember hardly that she wanted to cut bonds with me out of respect for him 

I will be honest I cried a lot, at this moment i didn’t cried since I had 10 years old 
And I cried really a lot, I missed school and everything, all I wanted is to got her back with me, I was destroyed 

Well after almost 2 years I finally moved from this relation 
Ans 2 years later, in 2024 she texted ( she tried to talk to me during 4 years but i kept refusing to talk because I would have fell in love again and I would be destroyed again) 
After 4 years I finaly accepted and talked to her 
I was falling again in love but in 4 years I became more religious I learned to put boundries and I knew that I can’t fall in love again cuz I will want to do stuff that I dont want 
A I told her that if I talked to her it would be with the intention that I would like to mary her but i hate to say it I would have to change a lot in her life and I dont find it fair

So I said to her that out of pure love for her I cant talk to her because I am not anymore compatible with her and I dont want to change all her life for me

23,1d28ekt,AITA for yelling at my parents over allowing my sister to skip a grade when they denied me the same opportunity a few years ago?,"I (14F) have a sister who is also (14F). I have a June birthday, so I’m one of the younger ones in the grade. My sister, Eliza, has a September birthday in the same year. (We aren’t biologically sisters, I’m technically her cousin genetically.) So while I’m one of the younger ones in my grade, Eliza is one of the eldest in hers. She’s a grade lower due to the age cutoff.

 We go to a small private school with only one class per grade (about 20-30 kids). The school recently recommended that she be skipped a grade, because she’s advanced. My parents jumped at the opportunity, because they’ve been trying to convince the school to let her in my grade since forever.

I (14F) have a sister who is also (14F). I have a June birthday, so I’m one of the younger ones in the grade. My sister, Eliza, has a September birthday in the same year. (We aren’t biologically sisters, I’m technically her cousin genetically.) So while I’m one of the younger ones in my grade, Eliza is one of the eldest in hers. She’s a grade lower due to the age cutoff.

 We go to a small private school with only one class per grade (about 20-30 kids). The school recently recommended that she be skipped a grade, because she’s advanced. My parents jumped at the opportunity, because they’ve been trying to convince the school to let her in my grade since forever.

25,1d289mk,AITA for asking my mom to pay child support?,"I’m a 20 years old college student. My parents have been separated since I was 14 years old, my mom had my custody, we got child support from my dad. I’ve always had a great relationship with my mom. I’ve been living on my own so for three years and my mom would transfert me the child support every time she got it from my dad since I live on my own. Here in Canada, Quebec, even after 18 years old you still get the child support if you’re a full time student ( not sure how it works in other places )

However, I noticed I didn’t get the child support every two weeks like the court intended. I was getting third of the money about every 3-4 months. When I asked my mom about it, she said it was my dad not paying the child support to the government. I believed her, because I had no reason to not trust her and my dad had an history of not being a great person overall according to my mom.

After talking about this to my older sisters both in their 30s, they were really confused by this, because according to them my dad never missed the child support payments, my dad even helped my sisters in some difficult times. This really made me doubt what my mother said, because I know my sisters would never lie to me. 

So, after, I said to my mom that I wanted to make a change to the child support deposits so that the gouvernement deposits could go directly into my account. She then proceeds to tell me a bunch of stuff on why it isn’t a good idea. I shared what happened with one of my older sister and she confirmed those were lies ( she has some knowledge about child support). I then understood my mom was lying to me.
 
Therefore I went low contact with her while taking some legal steps to make the change concerning the deposits. Meanwhile, I went over my bank account transactions of the previous three years, there was thousands of dollars missing. Got a confirmation from the gouvernement that my dad didn’t miss any payments in those three years, my mom was stealing from me. 

Therefore, I legally took steps to make her pay child support and pay back what she stole. After this, I was wondering why my mother would do that to me and I realized she had a cannabis addiction, I’m talking smoking at least 3-4 times a day. Before, I didn’t see it as an addiction, because I didn’t know any better. Now I see it and I’m only assuming she was stealing money from me to pay for her drugs even tho I was struggling. 

Now she blames me for this situation, she says I’m being cruel, she insults, e.t.c basically every time we try to talk. Besides, while this whole thing was happening, I never wanted to cut contact with her, because I wanted to help her get over her addiction. Despite expressing this desire to stay in contact, my mom just assumed I didn’t want to talk to her anymore for some reason, even after repeating I wanted to stay in contact.

So to give some quick context:

I've been in a friend group for a little bit close to 9 years. Theres about 7 of us (6 if you dont include me)most of them about a year to a year and a half apart. 
Also to be noted that all of us live in different times zones. We have also met up in person and things went pretty smoothly! I do know that we all grew up differently and have vastly different personalities but we all still manage to get along for all these years...or so I was to believe. 

Now to the issue:

My friends like to jest and poke the bees nest and get a rise out of everyone from time to time. We all know that no one really means it from the heart or an mean place. That's what we all would say time and time again. 

Except lately this year has felt so different and it's been really tricky to navigate since it's felt that I'm either a doormat or a ticking time bomb. 

Now I'm from Texas, I know we dont have the best things going on right now. Trust me, I hate it to. But they make it seem like I'm in control of what goes on here. ""Ugh I can't believe you love there like that"" ""shows what you really want in life"" ""guess all Texans are just that stupid"" Stuff like that. 

Now if that's something said once or twice I can throw it over my shoulder and laugh it off. Thing is, it's almost a reccuring thing that they always bring up but with slightly different wording each time. 
Every time I try to poke back and the places they live they get a bit defensive.
One friend just wants everyone to get along and worries about all of us but when they're in the chat they do absolutely nothing to assist in putting out a potential fire. They try to console me with ""that's just how they are"" kind of talk. But they never used to be like that! We both know that! 

Another time I got a slut by one of them ""accidentally"". 
They were playing Ace Attorney and there was a girl that hair the same color hair as me and they literally said ""hey! It looks just like you"" and at first I laugh. Then literally seconds after I started laughing they followed with ""man she looks like a slut though!"" 
I paused and responded with ""didn't you just say that to you that looks like me?"" They tried to back peddle and say that wasnt what they ment as they were laughing. It didnt feel genuine at all. I got that same comment ""open mouth insert foot, don't let it get to you"" and I just couldn't take it. 

One of them reached out and said that I should, in their literal words ""be a bitch to them"" but if I am they get all apologetic and play the victim card.

31,1d277ch,AITA for not acting as a B&B for visiting friend?,"My friend (35M) asked if he could come visit me (34F) and stay in my apartment on my couch. I said that would be fine, stupidly, before I knew how long he was coming for. I then learned he was planning on 9 days! I had already agreed so I (again stupidly) let it be.

He arrives and it’s not too bad at first. I am feeling depleted as he is around all the time but we are making do. However, it very soon becomes apparent that he expects me to drive him around everywhere, feed him when we are at my apartment, and hang out with him at all times while we are at my apartment. 

When he first came, we went to the grocery store and picked up some groceries. I made sure to ask him what he wanted during his trip. In hindsight, I should have told him to buy himself some snacks. Instead, he kept saying “I don’t know” and vaguely suggesting a pasta dinner dish. Okay, fine. I got some stuff. When it came time to pay, because a lot of the stuff was me replenishing my pantry, I just paid for it. No biggie. 

However, sometimes when we weren’t out doing an activity and got home, I would rest in my room to get some time alone. The first day or so, I hung out with him but after a couple days, I just got so worn out. He was left to his own devices. Every time I left my room during the evenings we were home, he would make comments and/or stare at me like I am being rude for not being in the living room with him and making food with him. Clearly ordering UBEReats was not something that crossed his mind. And clearly time spent apart is bothering him.

Finally he confronts me and tells me to sit down in the living room so we can talk (thanks for the invitation to my own living room). He asks me if I am ignoring him. I get upset at this situation and say no. I tell him that I am introverted and need time to myself.

The next day, we move on. However, tomorrow and the next day, I have to work. I remind him of this and tell him that he should be prepared to also get dinner for himself. He says “don’t worry, it was pretty clear from the beginning that you weren’t going to make meals” in a passive aggressive tone. Then I get very upset. I confronted him and told him that I didn’t agree to be his bed and breakfast. 

During this trip he has paid for 3 things. One, a tank of gas. Two, he paid for a $5 ticket for me for one of the many museums. And three, he paid for a $5 parking pass for a state reservation park. I paid for the food we’ve been eating at my place (and the 2nd tank of gas). We each paid for our own everything else.

He is unwilling to take an uber places by himself. Either I am ferrying him around, or he is sat in my living room. He also is expecting me to drive him to and from the city on the days I work.

It really feels like he is expecting me to wait on and entertain him and I don’t understand when I ever agreed to that.

",Not the A-hole,2024-05-28,"AITA for not acting as a B&B for visiting friend? My friend (35M) asked if he could come visit me (34F) and stay in my apartment on my couch. I said that would be fine, stupidly, before I knew how long he was coming for. I then learned he was planning on 9 days! I had already agreed so I (again stupidly) let it be.

He arrives and it’s not too bad at first. I am feeling depleted as he is around all the time but we are making do. However, it very soon becomes apparent that he expects me to drive him around everywhere, feed him when we are at my apartment, and hang out with him at all times while we are at my apartment. 

When he first came, we went to the grocery store and picked up some groceries. I made sure to ask him what he wanted during his trip. In hindsight, I should have told him to buy himself some snacks. Instead, he kept saying “I don’t know” and vaguely suggesting a pasta dinner dish. Okay, fine. I got some stuff. When it came time to pay, because a lot of the stuff was me replenishing my pantry, I just paid for it. No biggie. 

However, sometimes when we weren’t out doing an activity and got home, I would rest in my room to get some time alone. The first day or so, I hung out with him but after a couple days, I just got so worn out. He was left to his own devices. Every time I left my room during the evenings we were home, he would make comments and/or stare at me like I am being rude for not being in the living room with him and making food with him. Clearly ordering UBEReats was not something that crossed his mind. And clearly time spent apart is bothering him.

Finally he confronts me and tells me to sit down in the living room so we can talk (thanks for the invitation to my own living room). He asks me if I am ignoring him. I get upset at this situation and say no. I tell him that I am introverted and need time to myself.

The next day, we move on. However, tomorrow and the next day, I have to work. I remind him of this and tell him that he should be prepared to also get dinner for himself. He says “don’t worry, it was pretty clear from the beginning that you weren’t going to make meals” in a passive aggressive tone. Then I get very upset. I confronted him and told him that I didn’t agree to be his bed and breakfast.

33,1d26rd4,AITA for not mentioning that my best friend/roommate and I are NOT a couple?,"First, a little bit of backstory. I'll try to be as clear as possible.

I (26) am a straight man. My best friend, ""Chase"" (24) is also a straight man. We first met when we were roommates in college, 7 years ago. We became best friends pretty quickly and we have remained close to this day. While we were in college, I had a fling with this girl who got pregnant with twin boys. She told me that she didn't want them but she also didn't want an abortion, so she was going to put them up for adoption. I convinced her to let me raise them by myself. They are now 6. Chase has helped me with them for their entire lives, by his own choice. He was there for their birth and they now call him ""Papa"" (We did not encourage this. In fact, we discouraged, but eventually gave up. They know that he is not their father and that they have a mother).

After college, Chase, the boys, and I moved to another state and found jobs at the same company. It's a tight-knit and kind of family-run (my father worked there before he died, my uncle works there, and Chase's sister works there). Because of us working together and most of our friends being either from college or from our workplace, Chase and I have never had to introduce each other to any of our friends (with new people, we obviously introduce as friend/roommate).

Here is the issue: apparently, for the past few years, our friends have thought that we are a couple. Neither Chase, nor I, had any idea of this. People at our workplace talk a lot with each other, so I guess word somehow spread that we are together (which we are not and never have been). He is my closest friend, we live together, and he is heavily involved in raising my sons, but we have never interacted in any romantic way in front of any of our friends, ever. We hug sometimes and that's it. Also, maybe important, neither of us have been in serious relationships probably ever.

We learned that everyone thought we were a couple when one of our friends (""Bob"") introduced Chase and I as ""boyfriends"" to someone. We thought that he was joking and I told him after that that kind of joke wasn't funny. Bob asked what I meant, and I told him that I didn't like him joking about Chase and I being boyfriends. Bob was genuinely confused, so I said, ""Just because two guys are good friends doesn't mean you should joke about them being a couple"". Me saying this sort of shocked the friend group and they thought I was joking at first. Chase and I both clarified that we aren't together and that we're both straight. So now, our friend group is mad at us, saying that we lied to them. Calling us AHs for pretending that we were a ""perfect couple"" (?). One friend even said that he had looked up to us as what a relationship should look like (????).

I don't think Chase and I did anything wrong. We've never said that we were a couple, but Chase is kind of on the fence and feels like we should apologize.

While I enjoy the company, I have to pay the entirety of the rent, all utilities, etc. and she never contributes anything.. like at all. She does clean occasionally which I appreciate, but she makes food for herself and really never offers to help out. 

It’s an uncomfortable conversation but am I wrong for wanting her to contribute more? Whether it’s financially, or just making food from time to time? ",4.0,0.98237914,1,0
41,1d26kbf,AITA if I want to ditch my friend with a chronic illness?,"I (46f) have a close friend (44f) that I've known for about 10 years. I am single and she is married. We met through a networking event when we both lived in the same city. We hit it off pretty quickly and it wasn't long before we were hanging out regularly. We shared a similar sense of humour, political/social passions, music tastes, and we just liked doing things around the city together. Within a couple of years we were calling ourselves besties. 

About 6 years ago she was diagnosed with MS. I've tried to provide a shoulder and a safe space for her to talk about it, but she has always preferred not to. She'll often talk about doctor's appointments, tests and treatments, but never the mental toll it must be taking. 

When we go out, she hides her symptoms and pretends everything is fine. She mostly vents about her job, friends or family issues when we get together. She'll go on for ages about her toxic parents, friends, and coworkers. It can be extremely tedious sometimes, because there's just no end to her anger and negativity, yet she keeps going back for more abuse, with a big fake smile on her face. 

2 years ago I moved to a smaller town about 1½ hrs away because I wanted to be around more green space, and be able to afford a nicer apartment. She was disappointed, and I have made an effort to visit her regularly. She doesn't drive though, and she's just not a planner, so it's always on me to make plans. 

Over the last 6-8 months, she has been slowly reducing contact. I'm always the one to reach out. When I text her, she'll take up to a week to reply. We'll schedule a video call and she just doesn't answer, replying the next day to say she was napping, without much of an apology. 

Now, we've always had an understanding between the two of us, since long before her diagnosis, that it's totally ok to bail on plans if we're just not feeling up to it. A simple text is all that's needed, and nobody gets upset or angry. I know that her disease can be debilitating at times, and I totally understand that it can be unpredictable. She knows she just needs to say the word and we can call off plans - no problem at all. So given that backgroud, the lack of communication now feels intentional.

She'll say she misses me terribly, but then she'll go for weeks without a peep, except to send random memes, which are often sappy ones about friendship. After years of listening to the way she talks about the other people in her life, I can recognize that the fakeness is now being directed at me. 

I know the mature thing to do would be to talk to her about it, but I don't think this relationship is important enough to me anymore to keep trying. If I stopped contacting her, I wonder how long it would be before I heard from her again. I don't want to be that horrible person that ditches their friend when they get sick, but I also think that if she wasn't sick, I would just accept that it has run its course, and I wouldn't think twice about walking away.

42,1d26j4i,AITA For not tagging my sister’s name to ‘Thank you’ cards for a joint party.,"My sister and I graduated college recently and our parents hosted a joint party. I went to school out of state, so it was my first time being around family and friends in a while. Growing up my sister was much more community focused and she was always known as the kinder and more present sister. 

It was a great party and my parents’ friends were very generous. After a few days at home, I went back to my new home. On a weekly FaceTime call, my family happened to catch me while I was writing thank you cards. I had gone to a local stationary store and bought cards to mail thank you letters. On the call my sister asked if I was attaching her name to the letters, to which I told her I had not. I wasn’t doing this to be malicious, she talked about thank you letters when I brought it up when were together. I thought she would mail letters of her own, but apparently she threw the checks out after she deposited them, so she did not have the addresses to mail letters. 

Since our parents’ friends were generous and both gave us our own checks, I feel as though it would only be right for her to write her own letters. My parents sided with her saying it was selfish to leave out my sister, given it was a joint party and it would take no extra effort to add her name at the bottom. My parents are even suggesting I reopen the sealed letters and add her name before I mail. 

EDIT: and since I’m out of state she was heavily involved in the planning and coordination of this party. She feels as though the least I could have done was to add her name to the thank you letters.

44,1d26cx6,AITA for slut-shaming a friend?,"Disclaimer: I take full accountability for my actions. I don't think it was ok, but I also don't think what I did warranted everyone's actions. Also this is a pretty lengthy post. I would appreciate it if this doesn't end up on TikTok! I will be taking down this post if it ends up circulating too much. 

For starters, we'll call this person Mai (F). She had a pretty bad reputation, especially losing all her girlfriends and seemingly keeping all her guy friends. She became part of our friend group since she joined the sorority I was in and I invited her to one of the parties where she ended up patching things up with one of the people in our friend group. At first, I was hesitant to become friends with her due to her reputation but I gave it a chance because I'm not one to judge a person based on what others say.

Things already started off rocky with some of the guys instigating that we wouldn't be good friends. One of my gal friends didn't like Mai for seemingly flirting with the guy she liked. It was a pretty messy situation considering the guy wasn't exactly single either.

Regardless, I become good friends with Mai but I still constantly heard outside noise from others, more specifically the other girls in the group. A LOT of the people in the group called her an attention-seeker and other things that I don't want to say. It got worse when a lot of people thought her and a friend in the group, Rory (M), were dating. A lot of buzz about this went around in the group and I confronted Rory about it because it wasn't a good look. He didn't like that I butted in their business and I ultimately only did it because people in the group kept asking me about it which I didn't like either.

Fast forward, Mai and Rory and I stop being friends. The other girls in the group said that it's fine and they didn't like her anyways. This a pretty important detail to note is that it didn't help that a lot of the guys would often make jokes of pitting us against each other. The guys always seemed to have done that even before Mai entered the group. I tried my best not to take it too seriously, but it got to me at times when the girls aren't backing up the girls, and this was what I was constantly surrounded with. To give you an idea of how bad their instigations are, one of the couples in the group almost broke up because everyone kept joking around that she was probably hooking up with one of the guys in the group every time they would hang out 1 on 1.

Eventually with Mai still being in the group, we end up patching things up and clearing the air. Apparently, I had told people that she was playing Rory and that they shouldn't be together which wasn't what I said at all. People asked of my opinion and my words got twisted -- I said that Rory could get hurt because Mai wasn't looking for a serious relationship and he was catching feelings. Anyways, we end up being friends but it wasn't the same anymore.

I began seeing someone, Sam (M), and I would bring him as my plus one to parties. We met through one of those co-rush events and he was in the frat that hosted it. We first started off casually seeing each other but we had a complicated relationship since he wanted a serious one and I didn't. We were constantly on and off, mostly reaching out to one another when we wanted attention. I brought him to a friend's party where him and Mai interacted quite a bit. I didn't really care but what kind of ticked me off was when Mai splashed him with bubbles and soapy water (it was a summer party). They got close I guess but it was whatever during this time in my life. I told him that they seem to get along and that maybe they would end up dating (considering he wants a serious relationship). He said no and I quote ""I know girls like her, it's just all attention"". He continued on saying that he wanted to be with me but I wasn't ready yet.

A few months pass by, I end up telling Sam that I wanted to be in a relationship and I didn't want to play around anymore which was kind of true. We kind of start talking again and we end up hooking up for the first time. I of course gave him the ""what does this mean for us?"" question to which he said that he was still thinking about it. Liz (F), one of the girls who seems to absolutely not like Mai, started to not like me as well. I became some what good friends with her boyfriend since we had the same hobby of playing Volleyball and we would both go to the park to play with some of our other friends. I guess me being single made her felt threatened which I always found weird because not once did I show interest in her boyfriend.

Anyways, Sam ends up telling me that he's not interested in me anymore and that he felt like I ""played"" him. He explains that he caught feelings for me and that I just led him on. This is the part that confuses me because 1) we had only known each other for maybe a month when I first brought him to a party 2) we didn't consistently meet up AT ALL. I only mostly saw him at parties 3) he was talking to other girls besides me.

Despite everything, I apologized anyways since that wasn't my intention. I thought I made it clear that I didn't want a relationship but I guess not.

Here's where everything goes down -- all of us in the group go to a frat party. Everyone is there and I end up getting pretty messed up because mentally, I wasn't doing the best at the time. I pass out, wake up, and find Mai and Sam cuddling together on the couch. His arms are around her for most of the night and he lends her his letterman jacket, the same one I've worn before. I asked why he would do this and he said he only wants to be friends. In that moment, I asked him not to do this especially when he knew everything I've been through. I felt extremely upset.

A couple days later Liz and another friend, Ana (F), seem to be concerned and brought up to me how they didn't like seeing Mai get cozy with Sam. Ana especially says how she hates when Mai gets drunk because she gets really touchy with the guys. Liz just straight up slut shames Mai. Two other guys also end up telling me how they don't think what Sam and Mai did was cool.

Everyone was just feeding me fire, and not a single person was giving me any reassuring thought to it.

I end up blowing up on Sam first because he told me that he was going to hang out with Mai. It's also good to note that he apparently has a girlfriend already at this time. This party happened about 2 weeks after we officially broke things off by the way. I told him why Mai out of all people? And that he says they're just friends. I blew up and said she wasn't my friend and that none of the girls liked her either.

Mai ends up hearing about everything I said before I could confront her too. The people who I thought would back me up, all ended up dropping me. The entire group stopped talking to me. None of the girls talk to me anymore, even though they instigated most of the hate towards her. It's funny still seeing how they still hang out with her.

I felt bad for saying those things about Mai and will always regret blowing up like that, but was it right for everyone else to stop being friends with me? Not a single person has explained what I did wrong to them personally and I understand that I did her wrong, but everyone seems to be forgiving towards anyone else. I've been trying to move past this situation since I've made so many new friends who I consider my long-term friendships. It just really sucks because if I wasn't in that friend group to begin with, I think Mai and I could've been good friends.
