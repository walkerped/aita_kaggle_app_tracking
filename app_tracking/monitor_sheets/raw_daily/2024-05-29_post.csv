0,1d3gn1u,WIBTA to give his mom his gift? ,"things to note real quick : i am 18 FTM. my friend is 17M. We both are diagnosed with autism.  i got diagnosed a couple months before i turned 17 and have worked my entire life on social skills/cues. People just thought i was a dick, before. I‚Äôve worked on it and am generally pretty good at social stuff. AFAIK, he  has NOT had to practice.. He doesn‚Äôt have very many manners. My HS graduation is tomorrow. He is a junior, btw. 

his birthday was over the weekend. He gave me a wishlist for his birthday a couple months ago (weird to give someone else not ur mom a bday list at 17, but i let it go bc autism and it did make buying for him easier. just odd.) and he reminded me about it constantly (annoying but whatever. i let it go.)  We originally agreed to give his gift when we came back from the weekend. I picked out a movie from his list. I also got the listed snacks  bc i feel bad about only the movie. (I am broke rn. We have had to pay all sorts of senior dues and my grandpa just died. My mom is a single mom to 3 teenagers. We are struggling right now.) we don‚Äôt have a car so i had to order this stuff online. the movie was late bc  issues w/ the store :( so i bring in his snacks yesterday. it comes in last night so i go to school today (it‚Äôs a mile long walk both ways and i didn‚Äôt even HAVE to come to school today) to give him the movie. 

he says ‚Äúoh i already have this‚Äù 1) it‚Äôs rude to do that. i was taught to smile and say thank u for stuff I didn‚Äôt even like but okay. kinda hurt my feelings but there are bigger problems in my life right now. 2) he suggests a game that is $60 on his list.  He knows I‚Äôm struggling. I offered him the gift to take to Walmart and he can just Exchange it there for smth he does want but he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that so I just take the thing back and leave after some dialogue about gift cards. this really hurt my feelings ngl. I tried and it was on his list :(

he is coming to my graduation tomorrow with his mom.  I‚Äôm tempted to bring the movie and receipt and give it to his mom who HAS a car so it can be changed. I don‚Äôt want to walk 2 hours to the Walmart to exchange it for a gift card, then walk to his house and then home. 

would giving the movie to his mom afterwards make me an asshole? or am I overthinking this?

1,1d39n6c,AITA for telling my brother that he has no idea what he's talking about because he isn't a parent?,"I (26M) have 3 kids under 5 (4F, 4F and 2M) with a 4th kid on its way. Before we had kids, my wife  and I had lots of ideas about the parents we were going to be and we had lots of scorn for people who parented in ways we disagreed with but, as any parent knows, actually raising kids is hard work and you will break your ""values"". 

My brother (22M) is doing a psychology degree, with a few modules on child psychology and development. He regularly tells me that he thinks ""ipad kids"" are spoiled brats who will struggle developmentally and they are the spawn of lazy, negligent parents. 

I wouldn't say my kids are ipad kids but they do have an ipad between the 3 of them and more screen time that I would ideally like but sometimes thems the breaks. 

My brother also disapproves of the fact we give our kids sweets as bribes (occasionally) and have lied to our kids. Every time he tells me his views on parenting I just laugh and tell him to try being a parent, then I'll take his advice. 

Recently, due to an emergency, my wife and I needed a babysitter for a whole day so I called my brother because, despite his judgement, he is actually very good with our kids. 

When we got home in the evening the kids were in bed having had dinner and we thanked him profusely. He very ernestly told us that, now he had experienced being a parent, he realised that not letting your kids use screens was very easy and they hadn't watched TV or used their ipad in the 12 hours he'd been there. He also said he'd calmed their fears (they had been aware of the emergency a little bit), read to them, not had to bribe them to do anything with sweets and he'd dealt with very calm relaxed children, as opposed to the ""brats"" they normally are when they're with me (his words). He gave us a 20 minute lecture about our bad parenting and now that he was in a position to give advice he was going to give it. 

We'd been planning on giving him ¬£200 to thank him for doing this for us short notice and looking after the kids for so long but we sent him on his way without any pay. 

the next day I called him up to tell him I thought his behaviour was incredibly inappropriate, that I appreciated him looking after the kids but it was better he didn't see them for a while and that him springing that all on us especially after a day of stress showed how immature he really was. I told him that he actually didn't know anything about parenting because he wasn't a parent. I concede I may have gone too far but my mum called me up later to tell me my brother was crying and she called me a dickhead because he was just trying to help and apparently I'm a bad parent for dealing with peoples kindness so rudely.

2,1d323xp,AITA for assuming the food at a birthday party would be free?,"&#x200B;

My friend Jess (19F) threw a birthday party for her boyfriend Jake (20M) on Friday evening. She invited around 8 of us on a group chat after working out the date, saying:

‚ÄúAlrighty! Let‚Äôs do 6:30 tonight. Be there or be square. Jake‚Äôs house, ordering pizza so plan accordingly (ie eat before if you can‚Äôt eat pizza/don‚Äôt want any). Text me if you questions. Thank you.‚Äù

We (all 19-20) turned up, Jess put out chips and water, everyone ate the snacks and we talked. Jess went to pick up the pizza she‚Äôd ordered. Everyone had a few slices. The rest of the evening was great, we played some games and had snacks.

The next day, Jess texted the group chat:

‚ÄúHey everyone! For food and drinks and such from last night, I spent around $60. Can everyone etransfer me $7?‚Äù

I was surprised, as I have never been to a birthday party where food was provided, and then charged for said provisions. Yesterday (Saturday) I texted the group chat:

‚ÄúHey, is it common practice at parties for the host to ask for money/compensation after? If the host wants to split the cost of the party, I think that should be discussed first.‚Äù

Jake said he was sure we‚Äôd discussed this at the party but I disagreed. Then he added:

‚ÄúI would suggest checking beforehand in that case. Respectfully, and I am not trying to have tone, it seems unreasonable to me to assume free food without confirming it and then take issue later when your assumption doesn't hold.‚Äù

AITA for expecting free food?

ETA: as a few people have asked, yes, I chipped in on a gift for Jake. He was not expecting it and was absolutely thrilled. I‚Äôm very happy I got to help bring that much joy. 

Also I know the math is weird for the pizza, there were around 8 of us, all 19-20 years old. I rounded the cost as it were more specific, just for ease of understanding in this post.

She is very very sensitive and gets upset over the littlest things that could be considered rude or an insult. Anyways she started crying and went up stairs. My mom proceeded to tell my dad that he can do that with me (15) and my brother (20) but not her, she continues and says that he doesn't need to be the funny guy all the time, and that he needs to stop doing stuff like this and stressing her out and making her cry.


I laugh and tell her that you're one to talk, you stress her out the most out of this entire family, regards to her diabetes and that she (my sister) understands how her body is going to react to specific things like food or insulin or how her blood sugar is going to react to certain temperatures and that maybe if she got some self-awareness she would understand that that she's not perfect.

My mom got really pissed off and told me that I don't know what I'm talking about and that I shouldn't talk to her like that.

I reply with you‚Äôre just mad because you know I'm right, and that you can't bare the thought of me having more of an understanding of something than you.

My dad chimes in and says politely that I should have said that nicer. (Context I talk in very dead tone that carries very little emotion and a lot of people say I sound pissed off or condescending)

After that situation my dad called me into his office that said that I should apologize to her for being disrespectful. I don't really want to, my mom's not a bad person but I feel that she needed someone to teller that. Am I the asshole?

4,1d31v45,AITA for keeping my (20m) girlfriend (19f) a secret from my parents?,"As the title says, AITA for keeping her a secret?

I come from a semi-strict and conservative family from South Asia and my girlfriend is from the Middle East (but born in USA). I am Hindu and although she is not muslim, her family is. We have been together for over a year, but have known each other for a little more than two. Within a few months of being together, she introduced me to her family (slightly due to me pressuring, but mainly her) with the exception of her dad. She has also incorporated me well into her life with friends and work. I heavily appreciate this and could not ask for someone more loving.

Yesterday, we got into an argument and have not really spoken much today. I saw her after work and she brought up the fact that nobody besides a few of my friends know her and she feels like a secret and hidden. She is completely valid for feeling like that but she doesn't seem to understand that my family is different. If I were to tell my family about her, while they would warm up to her within a few months, they would give me living hell for being with someone that isn't south asian and Hindu. It isn't something they will just let go of like hers did after a few weeks. Upon that discussion, I also had to leave earlier because I told my mother I would be home after doing a few errands. She was upset with that too because our time had to be cut short because I had to be home earlier due to my mother's presumption I was doing something else. Above this all, she brought up how little she feels when my family calls me and I tell her to be quiet. I understand all of this and completely see where she is coming from. It isn't as easy as it looks or sounds, though. My parents are not very accepting, neither my relatives in general. I would love to be able to be open and bring her into my life, but given my family, it's not as possible.

I brought this up to her and rather it making sense to her, it sparked fear. She brought up the idea that if I am so worried for my parent's disapproval, then if they do come to know of her and disapprove, I am more likely to leave. I refuted that because truly, I would not leave and I do love her. She didn't believe me and by the time I had to go, nothing was resolved. I left feeling desolate and I assume she did too because later that night, she texted me that she sacrificed a lot for me and had to deal with tensions from her whole family because she introduced me and had to schedule things 'perfectly' so that she could see me.

That message led me to think, am I being the asshole in this situation? I told her time and time that I will introduce her eventually, but it's not something I can just do because my parents won't be as friendly. I feel bad, but simultaneously, hopeless. It's either tell my parents about her and deal with months of intolerance, disappointment and insulting speech or save my peace and indirectly hers and introduce her when time is right.",Asshole,2024-05-29,"AITA for keeping my (20m) girlfriend (19f) a secret from my parents?

6,1d31tnk,AITA for saying to a friend that I was jealous?,"For some information, I must explain two things:

  
First of all, I belong in the Puppy Play Community. For some basic knowledge, we are a community of people that like to revert our headspace to a more puppy-like one. We usually identify ourselves by our own puppy names, and our roles depending on how dominant or submissive we are (Alpha, Beta, Omega), and some of us have packs. This experience has to do with this community.

  
Second of all, this story takes place from Mexico, therefore all conversations from this experience were in Spanish. I was born and raised here, but I have always been better in English than in Spanish.

  
I was in a group chat of puppy play, and an Alpha called Astro had taken a picture of a gas mask his Omega, Taro had gifted him for his birthday. I looked at the gas mask, and felt jealous of the fact that I didn't have a gas mask with me, however, I didn't know how the word ""jealous"" was said in Spanish, therefore I entered it in Google Translate, and was given the word ""celoso"". I sent a message stating ""Estoy celoso"" (I am jealous).

  
A few minutes later, I am bombed with messages in the group chat, some asking what I was jealous about, and others accusing me of wanting to separate the Omega, Taro from his Alpha, Astro, and replacing him. I didn't understand how it came to that, so I started responding to the messages, stating how I didn't want to replace anybody and that I was jealous that I didn't have a gas mask. 

  
After a while like that, I decided to investigate even more, and realized that I used the word ""celoso"" in an incorrect context. Basically, ""celoso"" is used whenever you are jealous of people, but the word I should have used ""envidia"" is used for objects or situations. So by using ""celoso"", many people assumed that I was jealous of the people. 

  
I sent another message, stating my mistake and what I actually wanted to say, also saying how I would dedicate my time to learning more and making it up for the people I unintentionally hurt. I am still unable to decide if I was in the wrong, because I think I made an honest mistake, but some people still think I am at fault for the situation.

I‚Äôll be honest, I forged her signature on the form last year because I wasn‚Äôt sure how to ask her and kind of just said I was going to do guard without informing her of the dates because she‚Äôd say no. I know that was wrong on my part looking back.

I asked to do it again this upcoming year for senior year and she was adamant about her no and told me if my dad can take me it‚Äôs up to him. He‚Äôs a truck driver and isn‚Äôt here most the time however but has been able to take me for our training/camp this week.

I know i‚Äôll need her rides later on and she isn‚Äôt willing to help, but also won‚Äôt let me get a car or buy my own. We‚Äôve always had issues but this obviously will only drive us further away from each other. We‚Äôve never been on good terms for more than a week, and I know it‚Äôs selfish but i‚Äôll pick my happiness over fixing our relationship because that won‚Äôt work.

Guard is the only things that‚Äôs truly helped with my depression and i‚Äôm actually good at something for once and she doesn‚Äôt want me in it. P.S please don‚Äôt call me a selfish brat, this is the first time i‚Äôve ever chosen myself and I deeply care about others most the time.


Edit: It‚Äôs not about rides, according to her it‚Äôs about me learning my lesson. I‚Äôve literally never gotten anything big I wanted like this from her. And she won‚Äôt let me drive until after HS. I truly understand it‚Äôs difficult for her, but she makes everything a sob story and about herself. I can‚Äôt live with anymore it‚Äôs exhausting for her and I.

8,1d31ore,AITA for filing a noise complaint on our neighbors‚Äô kids?,"My wife (F24) and I (F25) have lived in our apartment complex for about three years. Ever since we moved in, we‚Äôve had issues with the kids in our complex destroying property (they literally set a bush on fire 18 inches from our bedroom window), leaving trash on our doorstep, pushing us off the sidewalk with their bikes and scooters, and just generally being obnoxiously loud every day. We live in an area where housing isn‚Äôt the most affordable and are saving to buy our first home, so moving hasn‚Äôt been an option.

Our apartment is closest to the playground, so before we signed our lease, we naturally knew it was going to be a bit louder than other units, but here‚Äôs the thing: these kids SCREAM. I‚Äôm talking, like, actual bloody murder. All. Day. Long. Since it‚Äôs summer break, a group of about 8 of them get outside around 8:30am and don‚Äôt go back inside until around 9pm, so we‚Äôre looking at 12 hours a day of listening to their obscenely loud ‚Äúplaying‚Äù.

Also worth mentioning, my wife and I both work from home, so we are on calls regularly throughout the day and there have been multiple occasions where we‚Äôve had to end meetings early due to the volume of the kids outside. We have to play brown noise at nearly full volume on our living room TV when we eat our meals or work on the couch so as to not be overwhelmed by their volume. We also both wear noise cancelling headphones about 90% of the time that we‚Äôre home during the day and into the evening, and even then, can hear them clearly. 

We‚Äôve brought this to the attention of our apartment management multiple times in person and via email, and they‚Äôve basically told us to fuck off because their hands are tied despite there being a specific clause in our lease that states we have the right to quiet enjoyment. We‚Äôve also spoken directly to the kids and separately to their parents who legitimately refuse to do anything. Just for example, I have gone outside 5 times in the last two days to ask them to be quiet and more respectful of the people living here.

At this point, we have no clue what to do. We don‚Äôt want to be assholes and escalate things too much, but it‚Äôs at the point where being home is a nightmare for us. We can‚Äôt work, we can‚Äôt read, we can‚Äôt even sit on our couch most days. And if we wanted to hear kids screaming for 12 hours a day, we‚Äôd have them. 

So basically, AITA for calling the non-emergency line and filing a noise complaint for this?

EDITS FOR CLARIFICATION: I am specifically talking about a noise complaint, not trying to have kids arrested. The goal would be to get the parents to take some kind of action re: supervising their kids. Also, we didn‚Äôt WFH at the time we signed the lease. We both received promotions in the last year that are WFH.

EDIT: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing a very good job of articulating just how loud they are. This isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúkids being kids‚Äù as I keep seeing people say in the comments. It legitimately sounds like someone is being hurt repeatedly and severely just based on how loud they scream.

EDIT: For anyone curious, I downloaded a decibel meter and looked up the noise ordinance for our municipality. The kids at this moment are hitting an average of 80 dB(A). It has spiked as high at 100.3 dB(A), and that‚Äôs from my spot in my living room with all doors and windows closed.

9,1d31i48,AITA for opposing birthday payouts from my Mom's estate which differ from what she's done,"For several years now, my mom has been giving the people that she cares about a birthday check of approx. $1000.  The same amount to everyone, but some years a little more and some years a little less.  The people she's gifted are her 3 kids, their spouses and her 3 grandchildren.  I have 2 daughters and one of my sisters has a son.  The other sister has no children.

This year, my mom gave my wife and I $1250 checks (both of our birthday's are in January).

My mom passed away in March before anyone else's birthday.

My sister proposed paying the checks out for the remainder of the year from the estate.  I'm okay with this.

The childless sister doesn't want to do it the way that mom typically did it.  She wants to give herself + spouse more because her family gets shorted (no money going to kids).  She wants to make each family receive the same amount instead of each loved one.

My mom has never done this because it would mean giving her children different amounts which she would never do and has never done.

10,1d31f7j,AITA for drinking a redbull energy drink?,"So I am 17F and am in alot of pain writing this, but it doesn't excuse my behavior. I guess I should provide some context- basically I am having extreme pain in my abdomen which may be due to an ovarian cyst. Its honestly impossible to stand up without being in pain. Now, on top of the pain I am in I also have a hefty final research paper to write for my honors english class. The teacher hates me and generally will only so much as pass me if I perform perfectly (this has never been an issue with other english teachers for me lol). Earlier today, I planned an all nighter and decided to purchase a redbull energy drink in order to stay awake. I thought that if I hid it in my room it would be fine, considering that my parents never enter my room usually I just study up there all night hiding from them. But, of course, sometime in the afternoon the pain got so bad that even the 2 advil pills i took did absolutely nothing. I'm lying in bed right now just desperately trying to focus. But anyway, I left the redbull on my bookshelf near the chair where I work and forgot about it (i only took one sip to save the rest for later in the evening). As i'm laying in bed, my mom came upstairs to bring me the hot water bottle and as she was leaving she noticed the can. 

Immeadiately all of the sympathy went out the window and she was yelling about how it was the redbull doing this to me and that I was basically addicted to drugs. She also said that I was in the wrong for exaggerating my symptoms when clearly it was the caffiene. I couldn't move to grab it or anything but I heard her bringing it downstairs to show my father and my sister. They both were appalled and my dad began to yell at me from downstairs. So AITA?

11,1d31ezm,AITAH for not giving my sister the bigger room for vacation?,"So, my older sisters birthday is a day before mine. I always plan my birthday a few months ahead of time, and communicate with my sister, dates and location, so we'd have a general idea of expense. 
For atleast, about 6 years on and of we'd take vacation together, unless my family and i fly out. It's me, my husband, and our 6yr old daughter. And her end is, her, her husband, and 3 kids (18yr girl, 16yr boy, 5yr girl) I'm always the one planning, and always the one paying upfront for all expenses for the air bnb. They would give me a payment plan to pay back because they can't afford to pay upfront for their  half. A few times they can't pay the ""half"" so they would end up shorting me a few hundred that I end up paying the extra for. I also end up buying all the alcohol. And we'd split food. Ideally because I'm paying more and my family is smaller, we'd take the master bed room which is a single bed, and my daughter sleep with us. The room she take would have a double queen bed to fit her family. This year, I told her I'm going on vacation for my bday, and asked if she would like to join my family, again. She said yes.
For about 2 months I've been searching air bnb vacation spots and activities to do while over there. I've been stressed between work, home life and planning my birthday vacation. A few homes I chose that are more affordable can't accommodate our group since it's to many of us, so we had to pick a bigger house, with the extra room for her kids. After I sent the link for the house and expense, her first response was, I want the master bedroom. I stood quiet. My husband then responsed and said, he think it would be fair for me to chose what room I want since I was the only one who planned and took the time and effort to make it happen. She then responsed and said that, it isn't fair I always get to have  the better room, every year. She proceeded to talk crap about the situation and said I was petty and selfish for not giving her the bigger room when it's both our birthday vacation. I don't think thats fair to say when every year I'm always paying more money so her and her entire family can enjoy themselves. This year is the first time we're suppose to split even for the house, but I was the only one who cared enough to plan the entire trip and do the research alone between working and home duties. She's a stay at home mom. She knew we were taking this trip months in advance and she never bothered to look into anything to help me.

12,1d316c7,AITA for not texting my friend by a certain time while I was moving?,"I (27F) recently moved to a new apartment. Several weeks in advance, I asked my friend Ann (30F, not real name) if I could bring my 2 cats to her place on my move day, to which she agreed.

  
When I brought the cats over that morning, I spoke with her husband since she was at work. He cleaned a bathroom in advance, so I brought in the cats and set up their litter, food, and water, and let him know they should be fine on their own. I estimated that I‚Äôd finish around 3ish but I‚Äôd let them know. He nodded agreeably and said they‚Äôd be around all evening, which gave me peace of mind that timing wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.

  
The move itself was stressful: everything took longer than expected, and we had to make 2 trips to my apartment instead of one. I had no watch, and my phone was in my pocket on vibrate because my hands were always full, so I wasn‚Äôt really keeping an eye on time.

  
I promised to feed my movers at a nearby restaurant, and by the time we got there it was 4pm. We hadn‚Äôt eaten since morning and just sat down at the table when I got a text from Ann at 4:04 asking when I would pick up the cats. I immediately felt bad and started replying, but she called me at 4:06 before I could hit send. Without saying hi she says, ‚ÄúWhen are you picking up the cats?‚Äù and I can immediately tell she‚Äôs pissed.

She yells that is absolutely not okay and demands I pick up the cats immediately, then hangs up the phone.

  
With no other context, I assume something terrible happened. I was famished and felt incredibly rude to ditch my friends at the restaurant for at least 45 minutes, but I didn‚Äôt want to leave my cats with someone who was irate, so I drove over and called Ann on the way to ask why she was angry with me. She said that it was obvious: because I never texted her. To pour salt in the wound, she made last-minute plans to visit someone, so no one was even home when I arrived. I transported the cats and rejoined my friends at the restaurant when they had finished eating.  
I spoke with Ann the following day, trying to resolve the issue. During this call she clarified that the cats were not a nuisance or an inconvenience - she hardly knew they were there, and had I texted earlier, there would have been no issue with me picking them up later.

  
She thinks I‚Äôm in the wrong and took advantage of her because: I didn‚Äôt text when I said I would, I didn‚Äôt apologize immediately when I answered her call, and I had the audacity to ask for more time after not doing the first two things. She was incredulous that I was upset when she was doing me a favor, and the whole situation was allegedly my fault for not texting her first.

We finished celebrating my grandmother's birthday (My mother and my grandmother's birthday are next to each other) and my mother made a snarky remark about how she wishes she got ""this type of treatment yesterday"" and I got mentally drained from hearing that. Now I feel shitty despite my husband and my brother saying I shouldn't and she's manipulated me to feel like this multiple times. So reddit, the big question, WIBTA if I forgot her birthday?

I (19F) spent a month with my mom to help her with my little sister and care taking for her landlord (That's another story) while she got herself together before moving into an apartment with roommates. It hurt to see my mom cry almost every day because I felt like I couldn't help in any way. 

My mom and I have had a rocky relationship since childhood because she sent me away to various relatives due to my dad's genetics heavily influencing mine but she's been trying to make amends for awhile and my inner child is still attached to her it seems. In April she started seeing an old friend of hers romantically and I'm glad she moved on but I wasn't ready to do so however I bit my tongue. 

Ever since he got with my mom he started parenting my little sister (16F) by yelling and cussing her out, he even moved in with my mom before their one month mark. He has severe anger issues and has made my sister cry sometimes. I'm heavily protective of her but I know she can sometimes misbehave terribly. It has gotten worse since my mother's boyfriend entered the picture, I feel like part of it is so my mom can parent her because my mom often neglects the misbehavior unless she absolutely has to address it. My mom called me earlier after I talked to my sister and found out she was yelled at again and even told to get out of her own home by the boyfriend. 

While on call my mom and her boyfriend asked why my sister was acting out so much and I bluntly explained that it got worse with the boyfriend and he shouldn't be parenting her by yelling and cussing her out much less parenting her at all because I feel it's WAY too soon for him to be a parent. He then cussed me out, called me a little c--t and everything and then told me he didn't care about my opinion yet he always calls me for ""family therapy"" sessions when there is a family dispute. I currently have a cold so I'm a bit more irritable than normal so I retaliated and told him to stop calling me every damn time there's a family issue and my mom got upset saying that she wishes I'd at least approve of her boyfriend because she's happy but I refuse to get along with a person that's like that, especially since I'm overcoming trauma from living with my grandparents (Also a long story).

I usually end up buying plane tickets, taking him snowboarding, covering meals, and being the host. As I have gotten to know him, I have decided that I just don't like him and find him to be a bit of a mooch. He also got my non-drinker 20yo daughter puking drunk on New Year's Eve feeding her drinks.  Last time he left,  I told her my wife I don't like him and don't want him to visit again.

When he texts me, I respond, but not like I used to. So he stopped texting with me, and asked her if he can come visit.  I told her that I would prefer he didn't and told her again why I do not like him.  She said yes to his visit, anyway.

So now I want to tell her I have to take a work trip and just leave town for a ""me"" vacation while he is here. She can figure out how to entertain him.

Maybe she will learn what a snake he is when she spends some time around him.

Edit: I had an epiphany when I wrote this.  Maybe I should call it AITP ""Am I The Pussy"" because I don't tell him he is not invited instead of making my wife do it?

23,1d2zx2i,AITA? Arguing over places in the library at university,"Ok I wanna know if this was my fault or not. I'll provide as much context as possible to try and avoid bias.  
Basically was sitting in the library eating mcdonalds chips and studying when a girl's phone goes off in front of me, vibrating the table.  
I look at her and she says 'sorry'. I say 'ok' and go back to my work.  
It happens again and I look at her phone again and she says sorry again, I go back to my work.  
It happens again and I ask her if she can turn off her phone, and she says it's her ringtone and the vibration. I go back to my work.  
Happens again and I look at her and she says 'you're so rude for staring at me'. And I ask why she can't turn her phone off.  
She blinks at me like a sassy bitch and says well you can go sit somewhere else in in the librry. 'It's a whole ass library yeah'. Then she nods and does that sassy bitch blink.  
She's so rude to me and then I say 'Jesus Christ'. And then the muslim girl has the nerve to call me a blasphemer. When she doesn't even believe in Jesus.  
I get up later after packing up my stuff and say 'Don't call me blasphemer'  
She does a sarcastic 'soRRY'.  
I go and tell the security guard how rude they were being.  
He comes up but he says at first it's not in the quiet area so he hesitates.  
And then I complain about how rude they're being. And she says 'well you were eating hot food but I didn't say anything I just kept my mouth shut'  
And I say 'If you had said I was bothering you then I would've left'. So in my eyes I was not a hypocrite.  
But in their eyes I was a hypocrite I believe, because I heard the security guard laughing at me after I left.  
In my mind I think they believed I was a hypocrite because 'I was doing something disruptive as they were'.  
But in my mind I was not because they didn't voice their complaints so I had nothing to act on.

Oh and I said 'you don't have to be so rude and sassy' and their reply was, as 2 girls and 1 boy 'we'll she's just a girl' with a wicked smile.

I will never understand neurotypical people, but from the way I see it, it seems a lot of them are assholes. And yes I am autistic. I was diagnosed with Aspergers at age 3, so I don't understand them.

And for those of you saying it's not the security guard's job, the library has a sign where it says you can call them if someone is being disruptive.",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-29,"AITA? Arguing over places in the library at university Ok I wanna know if this was my fault or not. I'll provide as much context as possible to try and avoid bias.  
Basically was sitting in the library eating mcdonalds chips and studying when a girl's phone goes off in front of me, vibrating the table.  
I look at her and she says 'sorry'. I say 'ok' and go back to my work.  
It happens again and I look at her phone again and she says sorry again, I go back to my work.  
It happens again and I ask her if she can turn off her phone, and she says it's her ringtone and the vibration. I go back to my work.  
Happens again and I look at her and she says 'you're so rude for staring at me'. And I ask why she can't turn her phone off.  
She blinks at me like a sassy bitch and says well you can go sit somewhere else in in the librry. 'It's a whole ass library yeah'. Then she nods and does that sassy bitch blink.  
She's so rude to me and then I say 'Jesus Christ'. And then the muslim girl has the nerve to call me a blasphemer. When she doesn't even believe in Jesus.  
I get up later after packing up my stuff and say 'Don't call me blasphemer'  
She does a sarcastic 'soRRY'.  
I go and tell the security guard how rude they were being.  
He comes up but he says at first it's not in the quiet area so he hesitates.  
And then I complain about how rude they're being. And she says 'well you were eating hot food but I didn't say anything I just kept my mouth shut'  
And I say 'If you had said I was bothering you then I would've left'. So in my eyes I was not a hypocrite.  
But in their eyes I was a hypocrite I believe, because I heard the security guard laughing at me after I left.  
In my mind I think they believed I was a hypocrite because 'I was doing something disruptive as they were'.  
But in my mind I was not because they didn't voice their complaints so I had nothing to act on.

We had just finished our show, and our teacher has a tradition where we either be in a group or a partnership for a lip sync competition. 

Me and three other girls, Julia, Mary, and Katy, were planning on being in a group and find a song from a musical to do for our performance. Our teacher only gave us three class periods to find and practice a song, and then it would be performance day. Me and my friend, I‚Äôll call her Julia, were the only two girls there during class, and we only had two more class periods to practice, but we still hadn‚Äôt found a song, and with Mary, my other friend, not here, we didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice. Me and Julia found a duet song, and began to practice so we would be ready for performance day.

The next day, I walked up to Mary and told her what me and Julia decided to do, since she wasn‚Äôt there, and Mary blew up at me and told me that her and Julia were already planning on being in a duet and kicking me out so I could find another group to join in on. I told her that because she wasn‚Äôt there, that me and Julia had no choice but to have her and Katy, the other girl there, be partners.

Later that day, I confronted Julia on what Mary had told me, and Julia told me that Mary told her that‚Äôs what Mary was planning on doing, and that she had no intention of kicking me out. She also told me that Mary had been talking bad behind my back and that I was a lost cause.

Mary then grouped with Katy, and found another girl, Tiff, to add to their partnership. Mary was absent at school for the next two days, meaning that Katy and Tiff needed a new plan. Katy and Tiff decided to do a duet, meaning Mary couldn‚Äôt perform with them.

Mary stormed up to me and told me that I‚Äôm an a-hole for causing her not to be able to perform, and I‚Äôm too stuck up and selfish to consider other people when I make decisions. I told her that because she was absent, nobody would be able to do anything, and it‚Äôs her fault for missing mandatory rehearsals.

She ended up having to sit out and watch everyone else perform, and I feel kinda bad for her. She started crying during everyone‚Äôs performances because she couldn‚Äôt perform, and I feel like an a-hole. Me and Julia won, but it doesn‚Äôt feel as good as I thought it would. She‚Äôs still sour and blames me for something I don‚Äôt think I could control, and Julia thinks Mary is out of line. Mary has a long history of this, too.

27,1d2yynj,AITA for expecting my husband to do more housework?,"EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful responses. I tried to respond to all of them because so many people have brought up really great points of things I have forgotten or maybe haven‚Äôt considered. It was scary posting to Reddit, but the fact so many people took time to really provide those thoughtful responses has made this a really helpful experience. I appreciate it! (End edit)

Throwaway account because he is on Reddit. 

Wife here:
My husband usually wakes up at 7:45, walks across the hall to his office and works 8-4:30pm. I wake up at 5:30, have to get ready and look presentable for work with a short commute. I typically go to bed by 10 because I‚Äôm a horrible sleeper while he will stay awake to play video games until whenever he feels like going to bed. 

We got into an argument because he asked if we could do 20 minutes of cleaning this evening which is what has sent me to Reddit for a ruling. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to and he can do it himself. 

I think because I leave the house everyday for work while he works from home that he has more time on his hands that he can use for a few minutes of cleaning. I‚Äôm talking like, quick maintenance tasks: unloading the dishwasher, switching laundry, vacuuming the floor. None of these take long and he says I‚Äôm unreasonable to expect him to do more of these tasks just because he has more time at home. 

Another good example where we disagree on chores is yesterday was a holiday. I had to work while he didn‚Äôt. He spent the day on the golf course while I worked so I expected him to pull more weight on the chores. He doesn‚Äôt think he should have to. But if I had the day off, even if I went to do something like golf, I would still come home and knock out a substantial amount of housework.

Husband here:
We split chores and would both say it‚Äôs 50/50ish. I believe asking to both do chores for 20 min shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. We both work the same weekly hours with me getting a couple more days holiday. I don‚Äôt think my wife getting ready for work and driving 15 mins means we both shouldn‚Äôt be putting in effort. My counter is that her getting ready for work and having a commute is easily offset by me putting twice the amount into our finances and should have no bearing on the conversation.

28,1d2yqyz,AITA for going to court to get money owed to me?,"The end of last year, my ex-best friend told me her and her boyfriend needed a place to stay. I had recently bought a house earlier in the year, so I had an extra room for guests. My ex friend in the past had stayed with me before in my apartment when I had one, but temporarily (no rent paid from them). We had been friends since high school, and we were close. My offer to her was $400 a month per person (so $800 total a month for the both of them). This included their room, and everything else in the house (shower, living room, wifi, laundry, food, etc). Let me also say, my total bills for the month are roughly $1600, so I believe it is fair.  She had agreed to this, and moved in the end of October. They paid me $200 cash, $200 Venmo for the first month. They told me they‚Äôd get me the other $400 by the time they get their next paycheck, since they had gotten a new job. I said fine, I trusted them, so I expected it to come soon. Two weeks passed, nothing. It was the next month and I was behind $1200 in total. $400 from the previous month, $800 for the current month. I kept asking them, not a lot, but every other week on the amount. They had not signed a lease agreement, but over text had agreed to the amount. Fast forward to the middle of December, I had asked them for the rent that was owed, and they told me they were moving out. They said it was cause they needed credit, so I said that‚Äôs fine, but you‚Äôre paying me right? I lessened the amount to $1000, just to get something, kinda like a deal. They told me they‚Äôd pay me at the end of December. I said okay. I asked them December 29th for the amount. No response. They ghosted me for 2 whole weeks following this, then proceeded to answer one day saying it was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and that they had never paid more than $600 for a room. I then lowered it to $800, and they told me they‚Äôd pay that. I have not gotten anything. I had just recovered from a major chest surgery, went back to work full time as well as full time college.
