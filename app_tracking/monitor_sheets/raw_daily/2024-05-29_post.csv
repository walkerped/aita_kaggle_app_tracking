0,1d3gn1u,WIBTA to give his mom his gift? ,"things to note real quick : i am 18 FTM. my friend is 17M. We both are diagnosed with autism.  i got diagnosed a couple months before i turned 17 and have worked my entire life on social skills/cues. People just thought i was a dick, before. I‚Äôve worked on it and am generally pretty good at social stuff. AFAIK, he  has NOT had to practice.. He doesn‚Äôt have very many manners. My HS graduation is tomorrow. He is a junior, btw. 

his birthday was over the weekend. He gave me a wishlist for his birthday a couple months ago (weird to give someone else not ur mom a bday list at 17, but i let it go bc autism and it did make buying for him easier. just odd.) and he reminded me about it constantly (annoying but whatever. i let it go.)  We originally agreed to give his gift when we came back from the weekend. I picked out a movie from his list. I also got the listed snacks  bc i feel bad about only the movie. (I am broke rn. We have had to pay all sorts of senior dues and my grandpa just died. My mom is a single mom to 3 teenagers. We are struggling right now.) we don‚Äôt have a car so i had to order this stuff online. the movie was late bc  issues w/ the store :( so i bring in his snacks yesterday. it comes in last night so i go to school today (it‚Äôs a mile long walk both ways and i didn‚Äôt even HAVE to come to school today) to give him the movie. 

he says ‚Äúoh i already have this‚Äù 1) it‚Äôs rude to do that. i was taught to smile and say thank u for stuff I didn‚Äôt even like but okay. kinda hurt my feelings but there are bigger problems in my life right now. 2) he suggests a game that is $60 on his list.  He knows I‚Äôm struggling. I offered him the gift to take to Walmart and he can just Exchange it there for smth he does want but he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that so I just take the thing back and leave after some dialogue about gift cards. this really hurt my feelings ngl. I tried and it was on his list :(

he is coming to my graduation tomorrow with his mom.  I‚Äôm tempted to bring the movie and receipt and give it to his mom who HAS a car so it can be changed. I don‚Äôt want to walk 2 hours to the Walmart to exchange it for a gift card, then walk to his house and then home. 

would giving the movie to his mom afterwards make me an asshole? or am I overthinking this?

1,1d39n6c,AITA for telling my brother that he has no idea what he's talking about because he isn't a parent?,"I (26M) have 3 kids under 5 (4F, 4F and 2M) with a 4th kid on its way. Before we had kids, my wife  and I had lots of ideas about the parents we were going to be and we had lots of scorn for people who parented in ways we disagreed with but, as any parent knows, actually raising kids is hard work and you will break your ""values"". 

My brother (22M) is doing a psychology degree, with a few modules on child psychology and development. He regularly tells me that he thinks ""ipad kids"" are spoiled brats who will struggle developmentally and they are the spawn of lazy, negligent parents. 

I wouldn't say my kids are ipad kids but they do have an ipad between the 3 of them and more screen time that I would ideally like but sometimes thems the breaks. 

My brother also disapproves of the fact we give our kids sweets as bribes (occasionally) and have lied to our kids. Every time he tells me his views on parenting I just laugh and tell him to try being a parent, then I'll take his advice. 

Recently, due to an emergency, my wife and I needed a babysitter for a whole day so I called my brother because, despite his judgement, he is actually very good with our kids. 

When we got home in the evening the kids were in bed having had dinner and we thanked him profusely. He very ernestly told us that, now he had experienced being a parent, he realised that not letting your kids use screens was very easy and they hadn't watched TV or used their ipad in the 12 hours he'd been there. He also said he'd calmed their fears (they had been aware of the emergency a little bit), read to them, not had to bribe them to do anything with sweets and he'd dealt with very calm relaxed children, as opposed to the ""brats"" they normally are when they're with me (his words). He gave us a 20 minute lecture about our bad parenting and now that he was in a position to give advice he was going to give it. 

We'd been planning on giving him ¬£200 to thank him for doing this for us short notice and looking after the kids for so long but we sent him on his way without any pay. 

the next day I called him up to tell him I thought his behaviour was incredibly inappropriate, that I appreciated him looking after the kids but it was better he didn't see them for a while and that him springing that all on us especially after a day of stress showed how immature he really was. I told him that he actually didn't know anything about parenting because he wasn't a parent. I concede I may have gone too far but my mum called me up later to tell me my brother was crying and she called me a dickhead because he was just trying to help and apparently I'm a bad parent for dealing with peoples kindness so rudely.

2,1d323xp,AITA for assuming the food at a birthday party would be free?,"&#x200B;

My friend Jess (19F) threw a birthday party for her boyfriend Jake (20M) on Friday evening. She invited around 8 of us on a group chat after working out the date, saying:

‚ÄúAlrighty! Let‚Äôs do 6:30 tonight. Be there or be square. Jake‚Äôs house, ordering pizza so plan accordingly (ie eat before if you can‚Äôt eat pizza/don‚Äôt want any). Text me if you questions. Thank you.‚Äù

We (all 19-20) turned up, Jess put out chips and water, everyone ate the snacks and we talked. Jess went to pick up the pizza she‚Äôd ordered. Everyone had a few slices. The rest of the evening was great, we played some games and had snacks.

The next day, Jess texted the group chat:

‚ÄúHey everyone! For food and drinks and such from last night, I spent around $60. Can everyone etransfer me $7?‚Äù

I was surprised, as I have never been to a birthday party where food was provided, and then charged for said provisions. Yesterday (Saturday) I texted the group chat:

‚ÄúHey, is it common practice at parties for the host to ask for money/compensation after? If the host wants to split the cost of the party, I think that should be discussed first.‚Äù

Jake said he was sure we‚Äôd discussed this at the party but I disagreed. Then he added:

‚ÄúI would suggest checking beforehand in that case. Respectfully, and I am not trying to have tone, it seems unreasonable to me to assume free food without confirming it and then take issue later when your assumption doesn't hold.‚Äù

AITA for expecting free food?

ETA: as a few people have asked, yes, I chipped in on a gift for Jake. He was not expecting it and was absolutely thrilled. I‚Äôm very happy I got to help bring that much joy. 

Also I know the math is weird for the pizza, there were around 8 of us, all 19-20 years old. I rounded the cost as it were more specific, just for ease of understanding in this post.

She is very very sensitive and gets upset over the littlest things that could be considered rude or an insult. Anyways she started crying and went up stairs. My mom proceeded to tell my dad that he can do that with me (15) and my brother (20) but not her, she continues and says that he doesn't need to be the funny guy all the time, and that he needs to stop doing stuff like this and stressing her out and making her cry.


I laugh and tell her that you're one to talk, you stress her out the most out of this entire family, regards to her diabetes and that she (my sister) understands how her body is going to react to specific things like food or insulin or how her blood sugar is going to react to certain temperatures and that maybe if she got some self-awareness she would understand that that she's not perfect.

My mom got really pissed off and told me that I don't know what I'm talking about and that I shouldn't talk to her like that.

I reply with you‚Äôre just mad because you know I'm right, and that you can't bare the thought of me having more of an understanding of something than you.

My dad chimes in and says politely that I should have said that nicer. (Context I talk in very dead tone that carries very little emotion and a lot of people say I sound pissed off or condescending)

After that situation my dad called me into his office that said that I should apologize to her for being disrespectful. I don't really want to, my mom's not a bad person but I feel that she needed someone to teller that. Am I the asshole?

4,1d31v45,AITA for keeping my (20m) girlfriend (19f) a secret from my parents?,"As the title says, AITA for keeping her a secret?

I come from a semi-strict and conservative family from South Asia and my girlfriend is from the Middle East (but born in USA). I am Hindu and although she is not muslim, her family is. We have been together for over a year, but have known each other for a little more than two. Within a few months of being together, she introduced me to her family (slightly due to me pressuring, but mainly her) with the exception of her dad. She has also incorporated me well into her life with friends and work. I heavily appreciate this and could not ask for someone more loving.

Yesterday, we got into an argument and have not really spoken much today. I saw her after work and she brought up the fact that nobody besides a few of my friends know her and she feels like a secret and hidden. She is completely valid for feeling like that but she doesn't seem to understand that my family is different. If I were to tell my family about her, while they would warm up to her within a few months, they would give me living hell for being with someone that isn't south asian and Hindu. It isn't something they will just let go of like hers did after a few weeks. Upon that discussion, I also had to leave earlier because I told my mother I would be home after doing a few errands. She was upset with that too because our time had to be cut short because I had to be home earlier due to my mother's presumption I was doing something else. Above this all, she brought up how little she feels when my family calls me and I tell her to be quiet. I understand all of this and completely see where she is coming from. It isn't as easy as it looks or sounds, though. My parents are not very accepting, neither my relatives in general. I would love to be able to be open and bring her into my life, but given my family, it's not as possible.

I brought this up to her and rather it making sense to her, it sparked fear. She brought up the idea that if I am so worried for my parent's disapproval, then if they do come to know of her and disapprove, I am more likely to leave. I refuted that because truly, I would not leave and I do love her. She didn't believe me and by the time I had to go, nothing was resolved. I left feeling desolate and I assume she did too because later that night, she texted me that she sacrificed a lot for me and had to deal with tensions from her whole family because she introduced me and had to schedule things 'perfectly' so that she could see me.

That message led me to think, am I being the asshole in this situation? I told her time and time that I will introduce her eventually, but it's not something I can just do because my parents won't be as friendly. I feel bad, but simultaneously, hopeless. It's either tell my parents about her and deal with months of intolerance, disappointment and insulting speech or save my peace and indirectly hers and introduce her when time is right.",Asshole,2024-05-29,"AITA for keeping my (20m) girlfriend (19f) a secret from my parents?

6,1d31tnk,AITA for saying to a friend that I was jealous?,"For some information, I must explain two things:

  
First of all, I belong in the Puppy Play Community. For some basic knowledge, we are a community of people that like to revert our headspace to a more puppy-like one. We usually identify ourselves by our own puppy names, and our roles depending on how dominant or submissive we are (Alpha, Beta, Omega), and some of us have packs. This experience has to do with this community.

  
Second of all, this story takes place from Mexico, therefore all conversations from this experience were in Spanish. I was born and raised here, but I have always been better in English than in Spanish.

  
I was in a group chat of puppy play, and an Alpha called Astro had taken a picture of a gas mask his Omega, Taro had gifted him for his birthday. I looked at the gas mask, and felt jealous of the fact that I didn't have a gas mask with me, however, I didn't know how the word ""jealous"" was said in Spanish, therefore I entered it in Google Translate, and was given the word ""celoso"". I sent a message stating ""Estoy celoso"" (I am jealous).

  
A few minutes later, I am bombed with messages in the group chat, some asking what I was jealous about, and others accusing me of wanting to separate the Omega, Taro from his Alpha, Astro, and replacing him. I didn't understand how it came to that, so I started responding to the messages, stating how I didn't want to replace anybody and that I was jealous that I didn't have a gas mask. 

  
After a while like that, I decided to investigate even more, and realized that I used the word ""celoso"" in an incorrect context. Basically, ""celoso"" is used whenever you are jealous of people, but the word I should have used ""envidia"" is used for objects or situations. So by using ""celoso"", many people assumed that I was jealous of the people. 

  
I sent another message, stating my mistake and what I actually wanted to say, also saying how I would dedicate my time to learning more and making it up for the people I unintentionally hurt. I am still unable to decide if I was in the wrong, because I think I made an honest mistake, but some people still think I am at fault for the situation.

I‚Äôll be honest, I forged her signature on the form last year because I wasn‚Äôt sure how to ask her and kind of just said I was going to do guard without informing her of the dates because she‚Äôd say no. I know that was wrong on my part looking back.

I asked to do it again this upcoming year for senior year and she was adamant about her no and told me if my dad can take me it‚Äôs up to him. He‚Äôs a truck driver and isn‚Äôt here most the time however but has been able to take me for our training/camp this week.

I know i‚Äôll need her rides later on and she isn‚Äôt willing to help, but also won‚Äôt let me get a car or buy my own. We‚Äôve always had issues but this obviously will only drive us further away from each other. We‚Äôve never been on good terms for more than a week, and I know it‚Äôs selfish but i‚Äôll pick my happiness over fixing our relationship because that won‚Äôt work.

Guard is the only things that‚Äôs truly helped with my depression and i‚Äôm actually good at something for once and she doesn‚Äôt want me in it. P.S please don‚Äôt call me a selfish brat, this is the first time i‚Äôve ever chosen myself and I deeply care about others most the time.


Edit: It‚Äôs not about rides, according to her it‚Äôs about me learning my lesson. I‚Äôve literally never gotten anything big I wanted like this from her. And she won‚Äôt let me drive until after HS. I truly understand it‚Äôs difficult for her, but she makes everything a sob story and about herself. I can‚Äôt live with anymore it‚Äôs exhausting for her and I.

8,1d31ore,AITA for filing a noise complaint on our neighbors‚Äô kids?,"My wife (F24) and I (F25) have lived in our apartment complex for about three years. Ever since we moved in, we‚Äôve had issues with the kids in our complex destroying property (they literally set a bush on fire 18 inches from our bedroom window), leaving trash on our doorstep, pushing us off the sidewalk with their bikes and scooters, and just generally being obnoxiously loud every day. We live in an area where housing isn‚Äôt the most affordable and are saving to buy our first home, so moving hasn‚Äôt been an option.

Our apartment is closest to the playground, so before we signed our lease, we naturally knew it was going to be a bit louder than other units, but here‚Äôs the thing: these kids SCREAM. I‚Äôm talking, like, actual bloody murder. All. Day. Long. Since it‚Äôs summer break, a group of about 8 of them get outside around 8:30am and don‚Äôt go back inside until around 9pm, so we‚Äôre looking at 12 hours a day of listening to their obscenely loud ‚Äúplaying‚Äù.

Also worth mentioning, my wife and I both work from home, so we are on calls regularly throughout the day and there have been multiple occasions where we‚Äôve had to end meetings early due to the volume of the kids outside. We have to play brown noise at nearly full volume on our living room TV when we eat our meals or work on the couch so as to not be overwhelmed by their volume. We also both wear noise cancelling headphones about 90% of the time that we‚Äôre home during the day and into the evening, and even then, can hear them clearly. 

We‚Äôve brought this to the attention of our apartment management multiple times in person and via email, and they‚Äôve basically told us to fuck off because their hands are tied despite there being a specific clause in our lease that states we have the right to quiet enjoyment. We‚Äôve also spoken directly to the kids and separately to their parents who legitimately refuse to do anything. Just for example, I have gone outside 5 times in the last two days to ask them to be quiet and more respectful of the people living here.

At this point, we have no clue what to do. We don‚Äôt want to be assholes and escalate things too much, but it‚Äôs at the point where being home is a nightmare for us. We can‚Äôt work, we can‚Äôt read, we can‚Äôt even sit on our couch most days. And if we wanted to hear kids screaming for 12 hours a day, we‚Äôd have them. 

So basically, AITA for calling the non-emergency line and filing a noise complaint for this?

EDITS FOR CLARIFICATION: I am specifically talking about a noise complaint, not trying to have kids arrested. The goal would be to get the parents to take some kind of action re: supervising their kids. Also, we didn‚Äôt WFH at the time we signed the lease. We both received promotions in the last year that are WFH.

EDIT: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing a very good job of articulating just how loud they are. This isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúkids being kids‚Äù as I keep seeing people say in the comments. It legitimately sounds like someone is being hurt repeatedly and severely just based on how loud they scream.

EDIT: For anyone curious, I downloaded a decibel meter and looked up the noise ordinance for our municipality. The kids at this moment are hitting an average of 80 dB(A). It has spiked as high at 100.3 dB(A), and that‚Äôs from my spot in my living room with all doors and windows closed.

9,1d31i48,AITA for opposing birthday payouts from my Mom's estate which differ from what she's done,"For several years now, my mom has been giving the people that she cares about a birthday check of approx. $1000.  The same amount to everyone, but some years a little more and some years a little less.  The people she's gifted are her 3 kids, their spouses and her 3 grandchildren.  I have 2 daughters and one of my sisters has a son.  The other sister has no children.

This year, my mom gave my wife and I $1250 checks (both of our birthday's are in January).

My mom passed away in March before anyone else's birthday.

My sister proposed paying the checks out for the remainder of the year from the estate.  I'm okay with this.

The childless sister doesn't want to do it the way that mom typically did it.  She wants to give herself + spouse more because her family gets shorted (no money going to kids).  She wants to make each family receive the same amount instead of each loved one.

My mom has never done this because it would mean giving her children different amounts which she would never do and has never done.

10,1d31f7j,AITA for drinking a redbull energy drink?,"So I am 17F and am in alot of pain writing this, but it doesn't excuse my behavior. I guess I should provide some context- basically I am having extreme pain in my abdomen which may be due to an ovarian cyst. Its honestly impossible to stand up without being in pain. Now, on top of the pain I am in I also have a hefty final research paper to write for my honors english class. The teacher hates me and generally will only so much as pass me if I perform perfectly (this has never been an issue with other english teachers for me lol). Earlier today, I planned an all nighter and decided to purchase a redbull energy drink in order to stay awake. I thought that if I hid it in my room it would be fine, considering that my parents never enter my room usually I just study up there all night hiding from them. But, of course, sometime in the afternoon the pain got so bad that even the 2 advil pills i took did absolutely nothing. I'm lying in bed right now just desperately trying to focus. But anyway, I left the redbull on my bookshelf near the chair where I work and forgot about it (i only took one sip to save the rest for later in the evening). As i'm laying in bed, my mom came upstairs to bring me the hot water bottle and as she was leaving she noticed the can. 

Immeadiately all of the sympathy went out the window and she was yelling about how it was the redbull doing this to me and that I was basically addicted to drugs. She also said that I was in the wrong for exaggerating my symptoms when clearly it was the caffiene. I couldn't move to grab it or anything but I heard her bringing it downstairs to show my father and my sister. They both were appalled and my dad began to yell at me from downstairs. So AITA?

11,1d31ezm,AITAH for not giving my sister the bigger room for vacation?,"So, my older sisters birthday is a day before mine. I always plan my birthday a few months ahead of time, and communicate with my sister, dates and location, so we'd have a general idea of expense. 
For atleast, about 6 years on and of we'd take vacation together, unless my family and i fly out. It's me, my husband, and our 6yr old daughter. And her end is, her, her husband, and 3 kids (18yr girl, 16yr boy, 5yr girl) I'm always the one planning, and always the one paying upfront for all expenses for the air bnb. They would give me a payment plan to pay back because they can't afford to pay upfront for their  half. A few times they can't pay the ""half"" so they would end up shorting me a few hundred that I end up paying the extra for. I also end up buying all the alcohol. And we'd split food. Ideally because I'm paying more and my family is smaller, we'd take the master bed room which is a single bed, and my daughter sleep with us. The room she take would have a double queen bed to fit her family. This year, I told her I'm going on vacation for my bday, and asked if she would like to join my family, again. She said yes.
For about 2 months I've been searching air bnb vacation spots and activities to do while over there. I've been stressed between work, home life and planning my birthday vacation. A few homes I chose that are more affordable can't accommodate our group since it's to many of us, so we had to pick a bigger house, with the extra room for her kids. After I sent the link for the house and expense, her first response was, I want the master bedroom. I stood quiet. My husband then responsed and said, he think it would be fair for me to chose what room I want since I was the only one who planned and took the time and effort to make it happen. She then responsed and said that, it isn't fair I always get to have  the better room, every year. She proceeded to talk crap about the situation and said I was petty and selfish for not giving her the bigger room when it's both our birthday vacation. I don't think thats fair to say when every year I'm always paying more money so her and her entire family can enjoy themselves. This year is the first time we're suppose to split even for the house, but I was the only one who cared enough to plan the entire trip and do the research alone between working and home duties. She's a stay at home mom. She knew we were taking this trip months in advance and she never bothered to look into anything to help me.

12,1d316c7,AITA for not texting my friend by a certain time while I was moving?,"I (27F) recently moved to a new apartment. Several weeks in advance, I asked my friend Ann (30F, not real name) if I could bring my 2 cats to her place on my move day, to which she agreed.

  
When I brought the cats over that morning, I spoke with her husband since she was at work. He cleaned a bathroom in advance, so I brought in the cats and set up their litter, food, and water, and let him know they should be fine on their own. I estimated that I‚Äôd finish around 3ish but I‚Äôd let them know. He nodded agreeably and said they‚Äôd be around all evening, which gave me peace of mind that timing wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.

  
The move itself was stressful: everything took longer than expected, and we had to make 2 trips to my apartment instead of one. I had no watch, and my phone was in my pocket on vibrate because my hands were always full, so I wasn‚Äôt really keeping an eye on time.

  
I promised to feed my movers at a nearby restaurant, and by the time we got there it was 4pm. We hadn‚Äôt eaten since morning and just sat down at the table when I got a text from Ann at 4:04 asking when I would pick up the cats. I immediately felt bad and started replying, but she called me at 4:06 before I could hit send. Without saying hi she says, ‚ÄúWhen are you picking up the cats?‚Äù and I can immediately tell she‚Äôs pissed.

She yells that is absolutely not okay and demands I pick up the cats immediately, then hangs up the phone.

  
With no other context, I assume something terrible happened. I was famished and felt incredibly rude to ditch my friends at the restaurant for at least 45 minutes, but I didn‚Äôt want to leave my cats with someone who was irate, so I drove over and called Ann on the way to ask why she was angry with me. She said that it was obvious: because I never texted her. To pour salt in the wound, she made last-minute plans to visit someone, so no one was even home when I arrived. I transported the cats and rejoined my friends at the restaurant when they had finished eating.  
I spoke with Ann the following day, trying to resolve the issue. During this call she clarified that the cats were not a nuisance or an inconvenience - she hardly knew they were there, and had I texted earlier, there would have been no issue with me picking them up later.

  
She thinks I‚Äôm in the wrong and took advantage of her because: I didn‚Äôt text when I said I would, I didn‚Äôt apologize immediately when I answered her call, and I had the audacity to ask for more time after not doing the first two things. She was incredulous that I was upset when she was doing me a favor, and the whole situation was allegedly my fault for not texting her first.

We finished celebrating my grandmother's birthday (My mother and my grandmother's birthday are next to each other) and my mother made a snarky remark about how she wishes she got ""this type of treatment yesterday"" and I got mentally drained from hearing that. Now I feel shitty despite my husband and my brother saying I shouldn't and she's manipulated me to feel like this multiple times. So reddit, the big question, WIBTA if I forgot her birthday?

I (19F) spent a month with my mom to help her with my little sister and care taking for her landlord (That's another story) while she got herself together before moving into an apartment with roommates. It hurt to see my mom cry almost every day because I felt like I couldn't help in any way. 

My mom and I have had a rocky relationship since childhood because she sent me away to various relatives due to my dad's genetics heavily influencing mine but she's been trying to make amends for awhile and my inner child is still attached to her it seems. In April she started seeing an old friend of hers romantically and I'm glad she moved on but I wasn't ready to do so however I bit my tongue. 

Ever since he got with my mom he started parenting my little sister (16F) by yelling and cussing her out, he even moved in with my mom before their one month mark. He has severe anger issues and has made my sister cry sometimes. I'm heavily protective of her but I know she can sometimes misbehave terribly. It has gotten worse since my mother's boyfriend entered the picture, I feel like part of it is so my mom can parent her because my mom often neglects the misbehavior unless she absolutely has to address it. My mom called me earlier after I talked to my sister and found out she was yelled at again and even told to get out of her own home by the boyfriend. 

While on call my mom and her boyfriend asked why my sister was acting out so much and I bluntly explained that it got worse with the boyfriend and he shouldn't be parenting her by yelling and cussing her out much less parenting her at all because I feel it's WAY too soon for him to be a parent. He then cussed me out, called me a little c--t and everything and then told me he didn't care about my opinion yet he always calls me for ""family therapy"" sessions when there is a family dispute. I currently have a cold so I'm a bit more irritable than normal so I retaliated and told him to stop calling me every damn time there's a family issue and my mom got upset saying that she wishes I'd at least approve of her boyfriend because she's happy but I refuse to get along with a person that's like that, especially since I'm overcoming trauma from living with my grandparents (Also a long story).

I usually end up buying plane tickets, taking him snowboarding, covering meals, and being the host. As I have gotten to know him, I have decided that I just don't like him and find him to be a bit of a mooch. He also got my non-drinker 20yo daughter puking drunk on New Year's Eve feeding her drinks.  Last time he left,  I told her my wife I don't like him and don't want him to visit again.

When he texts me, I respond, but not like I used to. So he stopped texting with me, and asked her if he can come visit.  I told her that I would prefer he didn't and told her again why I do not like him.  She said yes to his visit, anyway.

So now I want to tell her I have to take a work trip and just leave town for a ""me"" vacation while he is here. She can figure out how to entertain him.

Maybe she will learn what a snake he is when she spends some time around him.

Edit: I had an epiphany when I wrote this.  Maybe I should call it AITP ""Am I The Pussy"" because I don't tell him he is not invited instead of making my wife do it?

23,1d2zx2i,AITA? Arguing over places in the library at university,"Ok I wanna know if this was my fault or not. I'll provide as much context as possible to try and avoid bias.  
Basically was sitting in the library eating mcdonalds chips and studying when a girl's phone goes off in front of me, vibrating the table.  
I look at her and she says 'sorry'. I say 'ok' and go back to my work.  
It happens again and I look at her phone again and she says sorry again, I go back to my work.  
It happens again and I ask her if she can turn off her phone, and she says it's her ringtone and the vibration. I go back to my work.  
Happens again and I look at her and she says 'you're so rude for staring at me'. And I ask why she can't turn her phone off.  
She blinks at me like a sassy bitch and says well you can go sit somewhere else in in the librry. 'It's a whole ass library yeah'. Then she nods and does that sassy bitch blink.  
She's so rude to me and then I say 'Jesus Christ'. And then the muslim girl has the nerve to call me a blasphemer. When she doesn't even believe in Jesus.  
I get up later after packing up my stuff and say 'Don't call me blasphemer'  
She does a sarcastic 'soRRY'.  
I go and tell the security guard how rude they were being.  
He comes up but he says at first it's not in the quiet area so he hesitates.  
And then I complain about how rude they're being. And she says 'well you were eating hot food but I didn't say anything I just kept my mouth shut'  
And I say 'If you had said I was bothering you then I would've left'. So in my eyes I was not a hypocrite.  
But in their eyes I was a hypocrite I believe, because I heard the security guard laughing at me after I left.  
In my mind I think they believed I was a hypocrite because 'I was doing something disruptive as they were'.  
But in my mind I was not because they didn't voice their complaints so I had nothing to act on.

And for those of you saying it's not the security guard's job, the library has a sign where it says you can call them if someone is being disruptive.",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-29,"AITA? Arguing over places in the library at university Ok I wanna know if this was my fault or not. I'll provide as much context as possible to try and avoid bias.  
Basically was sitting in the library eating mcdonalds chips and studying when a girl's phone goes off in front of me, vibrating the table.  
I look at her and she says 'sorry'. I say 'ok' and go back to my work.  
It happens again and I look at her phone again and she says sorry again, I go back to my work.  
It happens again and I ask her if she can turn off her phone, and she says it's her ringtone and the vibration. I go back to my work.  
Happens again and I look at her and she says 'you're so rude for staring at me'. And I ask why she can't turn her phone off.  
She blinks at me like a sassy bitch and says well you can go sit somewhere else in in the librry. 'It's a whole ass library yeah'. Then she nods and does that sassy bitch blink.  
She's so rude to me and then I say 'Jesus Christ'. And then the muslim girl has the nerve to call me a blasphemer. When she doesn't even believe in Jesus.  
I get up later after packing up my stuff and say 'Don't call me blasphemer'  
She does a sarcastic 'soRRY'.  
I go and tell the security guard how rude they were being.  
He comes up but he says at first it's not in the quiet area so he hesitates.  
And then I complain about how rude they're being. And she says 'well you were eating hot food but I didn't say anything I just kept my mouth shut'  
And I say 'If you had said I was bothering you then I would've left'. So in my eyes I was not a hypocrite.  
But in their eyes I was a hypocrite I believe, because I heard the security guard laughing at me after I left.  
In my mind I think they believed I was a hypocrite because 'I was doing something disruptive as they were'.  
But in my mind I was not because they didn't voice their complaints so I had nothing to act on.

We had just finished our show, and our teacher has a tradition where we either be in a group or a partnership for a lip sync competition. 

Me and three other girls, Julia, Mary, and Katy, were planning on being in a group and find a song from a musical to do for our performance. Our teacher only gave us three class periods to find and practice a song, and then it would be performance day. Me and my friend, I‚Äôll call her Julia, were the only two girls there during class, and we only had two more class periods to practice, but we still hadn‚Äôt found a song, and with Mary, my other friend, not here, we didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice. Me and Julia found a duet song, and began to practice so we would be ready for performance day.

The next day, I walked up to Mary and told her what me and Julia decided to do, since she wasn‚Äôt there, and Mary blew up at me and told me that her and Julia were already planning on being in a duet and kicking me out so I could find another group to join in on. I told her that because she wasn‚Äôt there, that me and Julia had no choice but to have her and Katy, the other girl there, be partners.

Later that day, I confronted Julia on what Mary had told me, and Julia told me that Mary told her that‚Äôs what Mary was planning on doing, and that she had no intention of kicking me out. She also told me that Mary had been talking bad behind my back and that I was a lost cause.

Mary then grouped with Katy, and found another girl, Tiff, to add to their partnership. Mary was absent at school for the next two days, meaning that Katy and Tiff needed a new plan. Katy and Tiff decided to do a duet, meaning Mary couldn‚Äôt perform with them.

Mary stormed up to me and told me that I‚Äôm an a-hole for causing her not to be able to perform, and I‚Äôm too stuck up and selfish to consider other people when I make decisions. I told her that because she was absent, nobody would be able to do anything, and it‚Äôs her fault for missing mandatory rehearsals.

She ended up having to sit out and watch everyone else perform, and I feel kinda bad for her. She started crying during everyone‚Äôs performances because she couldn‚Äôt perform, and I feel like an a-hole. Me and Julia won, but it doesn‚Äôt feel as good as I thought it would. She‚Äôs still sour and blames me for something I don‚Äôt think I could control, and Julia thinks Mary is out of line. Mary has a long history of this, too.

I tried to respond to all of them because so many people have brought up really great points of things I have forgotten or maybe haven‚Äôt considered. It was scary posting to Reddit, but the fact so many people took time to really provide those thoughtful responses has made this a really helpful experience. I appreciate it! (End edit)

Throwaway account because he is on Reddit. 

Wife here:
My husband usually wakes up at 7:45, walks across the hall to his office and works 8-4:30pm. I wake up at 5:30, have to get ready and look presentable for work with a short commute. I typically go to bed by 10 because I‚Äôm a horrible sleeper while he will stay awake to play video games until whenever he feels like going to bed. 

We got into an argument because he asked if we could do 20 minutes of cleaning this evening which is what has sent me to Reddit for a ruling. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to and he can do it himself. 

I think because I leave the house everyday for work while he works from home that he has more time on his hands that he can use for a few minutes of cleaning. I‚Äôm talking like, quick maintenance tasks: unloading the dishwasher, switching laundry, vacuuming the floor. None of these take long and he says I‚Äôm unreasonable to expect him to do more of these tasks just because he has more time at home. 

Another good example where we disagree on chores is yesterday was a holiday. I had to work while he didn‚Äôt. He spent the day on the golf course while I worked so I expected him to pull more weight on the chores. He doesn‚Äôt think he should have to. But if I had the day off, even if I went to do something like golf, I would still come home and knock out a substantial amount of housework.

Husband here:
We split chores and would both say it‚Äôs 50/50ish. I believe asking to both do chores for 20 min shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. We both work the same weekly hours with me getting a couple more days holiday. I don‚Äôt think my wife getting ready for work and driving 15 mins means we both shouldn‚Äôt be putting in effort. My counter is that her getting ready for work and having a commute is easily offset by me putting twice the amount into our finances and should have no bearing on the conversation.

28,1d2yqyz,AITA for going to court to get money owed to me?,"The end of last year, my ex-best friend told me her and her boyfriend needed a place to stay. I had recently bought a house earlier in the year, so I had an extra room for guests. My ex friend in the past had stayed with me before in my apartment when I had one, but temporarily (no rent paid from them). We had been friends since high school, and we were close. My offer to her was $400 a month per person (so $800 total a month for the both of them). This included their room, and everything else in the house (shower, living room, wifi, laundry, food, etc). Let me also say, my total bills for the month are roughly $1600, so I believe it is fair.  She had agreed to this, and moved in the end of October. They paid me $200 cash, $200 Venmo for the first month. They told me they‚Äôd get me the other $400 by the time they get their next paycheck, since they had gotten a new job. I said fine, I trusted them, so I expected it to come soon. Two weeks passed, nothing. It was the next month and I was behind $1200 in total. $400 from the previous month, $800 for the current month. I kept asking them, not a lot, but every other week on the amount. They had not signed a lease agreement, but over text had agreed to the amount.

 I am a chef at a very high end restaurant and make very good money. I often cook meals throughout the day and buy most of the food. I always share and cook enough for them bc it just makes sense to, but every time they make their own food, or order out they never ask me if I want any.

 I know that seems so ridiculous bc I am literally a chef , but I don‚Äôt make them help around the house, I charge them 1/4 of the monthly bills and I just feel like offering to get me takeout for making enough of a meal so I can have some too would be nice. 

Right now I‚Äôm sick and not feeling like cooking , and bc I didn‚Äôt cook Theyve order themselves takeout and didn‚Äôt bother to ask if I wanted anything. I texted Sydney and said that think it‚Äôs selfish that they didn‚Äôt bother to even ask me if I was hungry since they know I‚Äôm sick and I‚Äôve cooked for them all week. Sydney said her and Justin need to ‚Äústart saving money‚Äù and that I am not entitled to being bought food , which I fully agree but I also cook for them 90% of the time.

It came to my attention when I was about 14 years old, and I started dating girls (I'm trans, ftm, and hadn't realized at that point). My family has always been conservative, and queerphobic, and I was too for a long time. They're somewhat abusive, so I was hesitant to come out at first.

But I did want to come out to them after a few months, so I could introduce them to my then-girlfriend (I know it sounds like a very naive thing to do, and it was. But i still love them as if they're the perfect parents and i wanted to share such an important peice of me like that with them). We were planning to have a Christmas party at our house soon, and some of my parents more liberal friends would be attending. So I decided that would be a good time, as there would be safe adults around.

So the time came. I was sitting at a table with my mom(41F), aunt, grandma, and my mom's friend, and I was so nervous I almost hyperventilated, but I got the words out. My mom didn't flip out or anything, she just was silent for a while, then said ""okay"" and moved on. Her friend came to me later and told me I was brave (I admire her to this day, she's so cool for that).

After the function was over, my dad(41M) called me to their room, and they started tearing into me about how embarrassing it was that I came out in front of family in friends and I should've told them in private so they could ""handle it""(??).

My father still brings this up quite often, saying I ""disgraced them"" and that im selfish for it. I think it was fair of me to ensure I had witnesses. I don't understand why he's so stuck on the topic.

At the last minute (after she had left), I told my parents I would not be coming and decided to stay home instead (which pissed them off). Almost immediately after they left, I felt extreme guilt, feeling like I am being a piece of shit (which there is a good chance I am).

I don't have much more valuable studying to do (as I am writing this Reddit post while they are all out), but I mentally feel exhausted and just need a break, not to hear some 14-year-olds bash some sounds together and call it ""music.""

38,1d3oj3t,AITA for what I said to my mom after she spied into my love life?,"I (20NB) am away at college. I recently upgraded my phone, on my mom's plan, but I am paying for everything regarding the phone itself. My mom has said she can check my sibling's phone and because she pays for it and my sibling is under 18, but won't check mine because I'm over 18 and pay for it myself. I traded in my old phone, but forgot to factory reset it before I left, and she needed the password to reset it, so I gave it to her. She didn't have it because I pay for it and I'm an adult. I'm fairly certain she went through my old phone before turning it in to our provider.

She asked me how long I'd been with my best friend turned boyfriend. I said since January (true). She said she knew we ""did the deed"" and that she's not mad, to which I said ""mom, I'm smart, I'm not getting pregnant"", because I have birth control *and* use condoms.

When my mom was 20, I was already 3 months old, so I waited longer than her to have sex, and I did so safely. She asked if he treats me good, and I said ""yeah, I know what not to look for because you have not-so-good taste in men"".

My dad didn't help raise me and my sibling (they split when I was 6) and my mom became a single mom. My mom's ex-husband was great until he relapsed and turned into an abusive alcoholic. Her last bf was great, but made comments about mine and my sibling's bodies and turned into a narcissistic jerk when drunk (about 5/7 nights a week). She acknowledged her taste in men wasn't great but was happy I was being treated right.

I didn't tell anyone I was dating my bf or having sex with him. The only way she would have found out is by looking through my old phone, when she said she wasn't going to. Again, I pay for it and I'm an adult, so she doesn't go through it (her words, not min). She went against her word, which is what bothers me the most. She trusts me because I've never caused trouble and I've always been extremely responsible. Yet she went through my phone after saying she wouldn't.

I was planning on telling her about my bf soon anyway, but we wanted to keep it on the down-low to slowly figure things out between us.

This morning, she texted me ""thanks for telling me I have bad taste in men. (Dad) was fine, (ex-husband) was fine until he started drinking, and (ex-bf) was fine until he showed his true colors. I feel like shit. So thanks. üòëüòë"" I apologized.

She acknowledged last night that he taste in men isn't great. Then today she decides she's upset about me saying that. However, I'm upset she went through my phone and snooped on my love life, after her saying multiple times she would not snoop on my phone. I wouldn't have said that if she didn't go through my old phone and read text messages that weren't for her eyes.

39,1d3ofum,AITA for throwing slime at my wife?,"AITA for throwing slime at my wife?

I (F32) have been married to my beautiful wife (F31) going on 3 years this July. When I met her she had super short hair due to a bad haircut which made her super insecure. She decided to grow it out, obviously, in the past 5 years which we‚Äôve been together. As y‚Äôall know, slime has been really popular in the past couple months and my wife and I have been hopping on that train. Yesterday, my wife had a hair appointment for a cut and color which she didn‚Äôt tell me about. My wife and I share finances and she‚Äôs in between jobs for awhile now and hasn‚Äôt had much luck. When she came home she was super excited to show me and called it a surprise. I complimented her at first and thought it looked good on her but after I asked she revealed it cost her $450! how did she expect me to be happy when it came out of my pocket?? I was already stressed from our finances before, so I was playing with our slime. So my natural reaction was to throw it in the air. It‚Äôs not my fault it landed on her head. Obviously I would never do anything to hurt her physically, but she got SO MAD AT ME?! She told me that her hair was ruined and I wasted $450 but that just made me angrier because it was MY MONEY. At first I would‚Äôve offered to help her wash it out, but after that I just needed to leave and cool down, so I went for a walk. When I got back, she had gone, but she left a note saying she was at my MIL‚Äôs house. I‚Äôve been texting and calling her all of last night and this morning, until she told me she wanted to meet in person. She came back to our apartment and revealed that she wanted a divorce. I think she overreacted and that this argument is ridiculous because it‚Äôs over slime. In fact, I should be the one who‚Äôs mad because she STOLE from me. However, I‚Äôm willing to move forward from this, I don‚Äôt want to lose my wife over slime. What should I do?

40,1d3o5y5,AITA For calling me mom's family pathetic ,"So a little context here. I (17f) come from a conservative country. So recently my dad got arrested for domestic abuse against me and mom. Initially we were hesitant about filing a complain against dad but my mom's family stepped in and said they would be paying for our advocate's expenses as long as it meant punishing my dad for what he did. At first I thought I had finally found my true happiness with my mom's family.

My mom rented a new apartment which was expensive for her peanuts salary (she is a high school teacher) but we were making do. My mom's family (consisting of her parents my uncle and his wife and another one of my uncle who is single). They always invited me to stay at their home as they insisted because of my dad they never got to spend time with me when I was a child. I was so happy to get another family after losing myfirst one. 

But then, one day my uncle (the one who is married) confronted my mom with pictures (which he got from her phone, he snooped around her phone without her permission) of her and her new boyfriend and their chats and shamed her for dating again when it hasn't even been 3 months since her husband was gone to jail. My mom and uncle ended up arguing and then uncle said he is cutting off all the financial help he was providing us. This threw us both off as it meant we wouldn't be able to pay our advocate's fees. We were devasted, my mom because of the crumbling financial burden and me because I lost a newfound family. 

Fast forward to today, I went to my uncle/grandparents' house to pick up my stuff but my uncle started badmouthing my mom and calling her characterless. It boiled my blood and I ended calling him and his entire family pathetic. I told them that it was alright if they hadn't helped us financially at all, but it was so awful of them to cut their help mid way through after they promised us to help. They were all shocked since I'm not somebody who is confrontational. My uncle ended up accusing me of being just like my mom. That was enough for me and i stormed off.

41,1d3o4un,AITA for asking my friends not to joke about leaving me?,"So. I've never done this kind of thing before, wish me luck. And I know it'll be impossible to make sure this happens but any youtubers who see this, please don't put this in a video. I'm worried my friends will see this post already.

Last night I (15ftm) was on call with one of my friends (18ftm). The rest of them were in the group chat so we could still talk to them. For a bit of context, 2 of the 4 people in that server have ""adopted"" me. At some point in the call, I forgot the reasoning but the one I was on call with joked in the group chat ""can we put him up for adoption?"" Aimed at his boyfriend (16ftm), my other ""dad"". After a bit of banter, he agreed to put me up for adoption. It hurt a bit because I knew it was a joke but I have a past of people pretending to be my friend, then turning on me and bullying me, or just straight up leaving, so I have abandonment issues. But I brushed it off.

I decided to message the boyfriend, who I'll call O. I messaged O, jokingly saying ""hey please don't put me up for adoption"" but somehow autocorrect turned ""adoption"" into ""Facebook"". Aaaand that's where it started going to shit. Now, suddenly, 3 of the 4 people in the server (one of them doesn't engage much) are saying ""oh yeah let's sell him on Facebook marketplace "" and we're debating how much I should be sold for. And the numbers were so fucking low. It hurt. And I KNOW it was a joke. But it still hurt so much.

After all that I message the one I'm on call with because I suck at words and confrontation so if it's in a message that's kind of... Less bad? So I tell him how I feel and he replies with ""I am going to be very honest with you, I appreciate you telling me, I do.
But you really need to work on this. we cannot keep walking on eggshells around you, thats not how friendships work"".

I believe that's in reference to me being uncomfortable with them being graphic about sexual acts. I'm fairly sex repulsed due to something that happened to me.

I live in an apartment block and recently became a member of the Homeowners Association (HOA). There's a man who lives in the penthouse and has been the president of the HOA for the past five years. His apartment terrace has been leaking into the apartment below him for the same amount of time. The resident below has been consistently complaining to the HOA, insisting that the penthouse guy needs to fix the issue before it spreads further.

The penthouse owner claims that the open area of his terrace is not his private property and that the repair costs should be covered by the HOA (from the maintenance fees collected from all tenants). However, this terrace is not open to public use and is privately enjoyed by him alone.

Upon inspection, I found that his terrace has a lot of plants and customizations that might have contributed to the leakage over time. He continues to refuse to repair it at his own expense.

During a recent confrontation, I told him that if he claims the terrace is public property, then all the tenants should have access to it. If he wants to keep it private, then he needs to be responsible for the repairs. He didn't take this well and argued back.

Given his long tenure as HOA president and his refusal to address this issue, I'm wondering if I handled this the right way.

So, AITA for insisting that he either opens his terrace to public use if it's ""public property"" or takes responsibility for the repairs since he enjoys it privately?

Edit: We are based in India so there are not clear rules in the CC&R. We are worried if we let this slide it will apply to anyone in the block. In the past, when there are issues the problem party pays most of the cost and the apartment below pays a small amount as well.

The penthouse has a larger balcony than the lower floors. All balconies are maintained by the respective flat owners up to this point.

External maintenance, including elevators, common areas, external walls, plumbing, paint, and shared amenities are all covered by the HOA.

The penthouse owner installed new flooring themselves and have large plants that have led to leakage. Access to the balcony is only through their apartment.

My (29f) boyfriend (28m) and I live in different cities (hemispheres up until a recent development). Generally, we get along well and our relationship of 2.5 years is going great. 

Recently, he‚Äôs been visiting me in a house I just bought, and when he arrived we went out for lunch and had some leftovers to take home. When I‚Äôm by myself, I always make dinner that is at least two portions and then save the leftovers to take with me to have at work. When we are out, we had two pizzas - he had a meaty one and I had a veggie one, we took the leftovers in two separate boxes. Obviously, I assumed I‚Äôm taking mine to work.

49,1d3mgoc,AITA for not paying to remove asbestos,"My husband and I have recently bought a house which needs a lot of work. We had an asbestos floor which we discovered and got it professionally removed and they told us the artex ceiling was also asbestos. My husband saw this product which is supposed to remove asbestos without releasing the fibres. I asked him not to do it himself as it obviously has to work perfectly in order to remove the asbestos safely and he has no experience in this. Myself and my parents asked him again not to do it and that I would sort it out in the 2 weeks he‚Äôs away for work. However, he messaged and said he refused to pay to have it removed. So I waited until he came home to discuss this as I couldn‚Äôt spend our money for the house, when he hadn‚Äôt given consent. Also I am pregnant and was experiencing very extreme nausea at the time, my job is a very tough healthcare job and I moved all of our belongings out of our old house with my mum that week whilst he was away so I was exhausted and didn‚Äôt have a lot of headspace. When he came back, he waited until I was asleep from night shifts and went to remove the asbestos himself. The product did not work at all and so he ripped the whole ceiling down in anger, likely releasing asbestos fibres and costing more money to replace the whole ceiling. He was also supposed to take me to my shift and he didn‚Äôt turn up or answer the phone so I had no idea where he was and was worried something had happened to him. I was upset and angry that he had done this. We then planned for no one to enter the house, get samples from the ceiling and get the house professionally cleared and cleaned when there is more proof it‚Äôs asbestos. When asbestos is discovered, you should isolate the area, change your, clothes, shower etc etc. He then waited until I was asleep from night shifts again and went back into the house opening the doors, going into all the rooms and potentially spreading asbestos fibres around the house. He didn‚Äôt change his clothes and came back to my parent‚Äôs house, potentially spreading it there. Again I was really upset about this.

He is overly obsessed with being real and authentic, and has expressed that he doesn't want me in his life if I'm only there because I feel bad for him.
  
Because of this I haven't been in touch with him for a while now, but I feel like an asshole because he does need help and I don't think he has anyone else. Am I the asshole for not forcing a friendship in an attempt to help?",0.0,0.01805141381919384,0,1
55,1d3llrh,Update of AITA for Waking up my Dad to deal with my little brother,"I promised myself to upload an update
Yesterday I had therapy with my parents, I was brutally clear and told them many of the things they put in the comments, I told them that I was not my brother's mother, that I would no longer take care of him, nor would I be part of his upbringing. , which could sometimes help on the academic side (I study pedagogy and would like to be a teacher) as long as he is respectful and grateful, if you forget it I would no longer help him.
My dad made me feel heard and admitted that they had left a lot of that weight on me and that it was wrong and he apologized, he told me that he promised to correct my brother and take his rightful role in raising my brother. (thank God for my dad)
My mother, on the other hand, blamed me for only leaving it in charge because I don't go out, and I never do anything, which is why she ""leaves it in charge"" for me. 
My dad told him that it's not my responsibility, he added that maybe the reason he didn't go out is because he always leaves my brother behind.
My psychologist agreed with me and my father, she told my mother that it was her job and not mine to leave me alone, that I would no longer be responsible for him, in other words it was said that I I would no longer be responsible for him.
I know that some told me to leave and yes I plan to do it but not at the moment I will wait a few more months

56,1d3ll5s,AITA for not caring if my adopted sister feels included,"I(23F) have a biological brother (24) and an adopted sister (27).She was adopted when I was a year old and she was around 4. For most of my life, my sister received all the attention from our parents and my brother and I were just there. My parents would bend over backwards to make sure she felt like a part of the family, which is great, except they didn't bother to make my brother and I feel included. 
When she was 19, we found her biological family and they have a great relationship now. But I feel like this completely ruined our own family dynamic.  
Our dad died 5 years ago, and it seems like  she just moved on from our dad to the other dad and is also slowly moving on from our family to her biological family. Her biological mums side also seems to have a problem with us because we are white and my sister is black so  everytime we try to be involved in activities, there are always jabs at us and I think they encourage her to become distant from us.
My mum still acts like my sister is the centre of our world though. The last two Thanksgivings, we had to have family Thanksgiving dinner days before because my sister was going to have Thanksgiving with her bio family. Same for the previous Christmas, we exchanged gifts by the 20th, and my sister didn't even bring my nephew as he was  at his bio grandma's.

My final straw has been a trip we had been planning in honour of my dad. On the 5 year anniversary of his passing, we were going to plant an orchard in a certain African country my dad worked and lived in for years and we visited many times. Planting this was something my dad had planned before he died and had it planned to a T, so we would only be executing his plan.  We had agreed that the 5 year anniversary felt like the perfect time. Except now, my sister's biological sister will be getting married around the same time ( not same day), but it means my sister can only join us after the actual anniversary day. My mum says it's okay, we can plant the trees a week or two later, and she actually said  that when we plant the trees doesn't make much difference we'll still be honoring him, but that my sister will only ever get to attend her sister's wedding once. She says it's a week's worth of work anyway, so it's not like we were going to be done on the actual day. 

This made me mad and I have told them I will be breaking the ground  on the actual anniversary day with or without any of them.  She said I was being inconsiderate and that I should think about how this will make my sister feel like she doesn't matter to the family. My sister has been part of our family the same amount of time I have been , only she can exclude herself. 
My brother keeps flip-floping between coming with me to be there for the anniversary, or waiting for my mum and sister some days later and I honestly can't also blame him.

58,1d3le0k,AITA for wanting one more tattoo before trying to get pregnant?,"My husband (28m) and I (27f) are waiting until July to start trying for a baby (waiting for some work and financial circumstances to line up). We are very excited about this, and at the same time realize that becoming parents would change our lives forever (also we are aware that fertility is not guaranteed).

Given that we will start trying for a baby soon, this year has felt like a ‚Äúlast hurrah‚Äù in a lot of ways: I have gone on two international trips, gotten two tattoos (one big and one small), our summer is packed full of short weekend trips, and we are planning a 10-day trip to the UK in the fall.

Here is my dilemma - I really love getting tattoos and historically have been very good about planning for them. For example, the tattoo I got earlier this year was a project I had saved and planned for almost two years. I thought I would be okay being done with tattoos for the foreseeable future after this one (getting inked is not advisable during pregnancy and breastfeeding).

However, I just discovered an artist whose unique style I absolutely adore and I immediately knew which design I would want from him (bearded dragon). He has a few open slots for June (when it would still be safe for me to get tattooed). I can move funds from my tattoo saving account to have enough for it, so money is not an issue.

My husband and I have joint finances (and we both work), so we always run big decisions by each other. When I brought this idea to him, he said that I‚Äôm being impulsive by wanting this tattoo within a week of discovering the artist, and that it seems that all the other trips/tattoos this year haven‚Äôt been enough for me, and that I‚Äôll just keep wanting more. 

He said I shouldn‚Äôt make a decision this permanent on such short notice, even though I‚Äôve always known that I wanted a bearded dragon tattoo (I have a pet beardie that I want a portrait of). He also said I should use this hiatus to save up for the sleeve that I‚Äôve been wanting instead (he isn‚Äôt anti-tattoo).

My perspective is that I have one more chance to get a tattoo that I will love before I potentially waiting years for another one (we want multiple kids). My husband has always been very calculated and frugal, but just because it‚Äôs not something he would personally do doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt want it for myself.

 It feels unfair to me because *his* body won‚Äôt undergo any major changes that would affect his ability to pursue his hobbies (reading and watching/playing soccer), while some of the things I enjoy most (getting tattooed and bouldering) would be things I‚Äôd have to give up for a good chunk of time.

59,1d3lctr,WIBTA If I reported my neighbors to the council for numerous building code violations?,"


 Let me tell you up front: Normally, I would not report someone for something as trivial. And exactly that might make me the asshole in this case.

**The Story So Far**

About half a year ago, new neighbors moved into the house next door, replacing a nice lady and her son with whom we had a cordial relationship. It went so far that we built our fence about 40-50 cm in front of the property line, thus giving her a few square meters of land. That is important later.

Half a year ago, the new neighbors came: parents, three children, three cars, a camping trailer, a normal trailer, a tractor, bikes, and assorted junk. Not to mention a chicken coop, including an obnoxious rooster. Since all of that does not fit into their small property, they started taking over a vacant lot.

Furthermore, they built two sheds, at least one is larger than permitted and both are crossing the property line. Not to mention that those things are ugly and right in front of our door. To add to the lovely view, the space between our fence and their shed has turned into some kind of junkyard.

They also paved part of their backyard and built an illegal parking space.

Would I report all of that if the neighbors were nice and respectful? Probably not.

**The End of Peace and Quiet**

But there are things that piss us off. Constant noise. Nothing illegal but still annoying, especially because we are working from home. Power tools, the tractor, compressors, and a plethora of other things are used all the time, even in the evening. And there's the kids who got a basketball hoop which is directly next to our front yard, with balls constantly flying into our garden, hitting the cars, and so forth. The kids were constantly trespassing and damaging our things. I found the cables of our lawn mower cut twice, probably because someone stumbled over them.

And when we locked the gate, they just climbed it. Only when my wife finally got hold of them and told them off did they stop for a time.

To make it short: we are annoyed with these neighbors, feel that they disregard every rule, and think they can do what they want while we are always trying to be respectful and considerate.

We can't do anything about most of the things that annoy us, but we can try to stop them from encroaching on our land and breaking the laws and regulations, partly to get back at them. Would I be the asshole?


Update: we are currently on vacation and got a movement alert from our cameras. The neigbour's kids had somehow managed to get several balls in our garden. They then started climbing over our gate. I chased them off by buzzing the siren of our alarm system a few times. Half an hour later we got a second alarm. They were at it again. I used the siren and warned via loud speaker that I would call the police if they did not leave imideately. They ran off.

Later I got the kids mother on the phone who was quite polite but did not seem to understand that we don't want anyone to trespass. ",Not enough info,2024-05-29,"WIBTA If I reported my neighbors to the council for numerous building code violations?

60,1d3khuh,AITA for disliking my mom's boyfriend?,"Hello! I apologize if this post is funky looking, this is my first time posting on Reddit, but I'd like an outsider's view of what's happening to me right now. I appreciate everyone who even just reads this, it means a lot. 

I (FTM18) and my mother (F49) have been butting heads a lot for the past few months. She and my father separated in 2020 before his passing in 2022. His passing has been hard for me, and I find it very difficult to cope with the fact that he's gone and I'll never be able to see him again. It's painful, and my mom doesn't help this at all with her long-distance boyfriend.

She had confessed to me (in a bragging manner as well) that when I was seven years old she cheated on my dad with her current boyfriend (M51) and she had been doing so for the remainder of their relationship. Of course, I knew this to an extent, having endured several nights of hearing screaming matches between the two because my dad saw a Facebook notification coming from him. However I didn't know the extent of this until recently, and I do not approve of him. It also rubs me the wrong way that they made their relationship official the year he died, but I may be reading too deep into it. 

I love my mother, but I cannot have a conversation with her about this at all. She always excuses what she did, saying that he cheated too (which I've never heard of) and it results in her screaming at me even if I keep my voice low and calm. She says she ""doesn't realize she's screaming at me"" which I don't believe honestly. She only screams at me when I say something she doesn't like. But I don't know. It's just incredibly frustrating. I feel like I don't matter to her at this point. Every time he's here, it's all about him and what he wants. 

It all came to a head today when we were going to town. I was a little frustrated today. He has been visiting for a few days, and my routine with my mom (like going to the gym) has just been set aside just because he's here. I understand they want to spend time together, however, I feel like I'm being put on the sidelines because of a man. It also doesn't help that I'm constantly thinking about what happened between her and my dad. 

But when we got into the car, the usual happened: me trying to explain my feelings and getting screamed at. But on the way back, things escalated, to the point where my mom was blowing up at me and screaming at me at the top of my lungs. She refused to have a conversation with her boyfriend about my feelings, saying that she was afraid he'd leave her because of me and that my feelings didn't matter because she was happy and he'd done so much for her. She also said that I had no right to feel upset because he hadn't done anything to mistreat me. I feel bad because I did freak out, I started hysterically crying. It's just frustrating because that is when she cared about me and how I felt. However, she kept trying to hug and touch me when I was screaming at her to not touch me. I hate how I have to have an extreme reaction for her to care about how I feel. 

I just got home and went to my room, which is where I'm at now. She did come in once to try to get me to hug her, which I declined. She's left me alone since.

My sister just graduated and it was hell.

Now, after dealing with the fallout of conversations with my siblings and with me being the next graduate, WIBTA for not inviting my parents to my graduation?

\*\*For context, they won't be able to show up to graduation anyways because I am graduating early. They know this but they don't know how early. I have told them I enrolled in a new program so that I graduate on time but that's only partially true; TLDR -- I can graduate without them knowing when bc I'm the only one that knows when I am graduating, I'm also zero contact with my mom.

  
\*\* Additional information: when I graduated from high school they did a similar thing and I felt guilty the entire weekend. They were very aggressive, condescending and on multiple accounts shared how annoying the whole event was because they were bored or they fought with each other.

Not sure if i am the asshole here and so have come to this subreddit.

My wife and I went on a weekend trip to an Airbnb which was listed as pet friendly. I was up front with the host that we were travelling with our 3 border collies. We were hardly there other than as a place to sleep.

The listing had no rules or restrictions about where our dogs could be in the property nor any rules that we were responsible for cleaning the property. While we were there, our dogs slept in the bedroom with us and at times were on the bed. 

We had a great trip but after we left we received a very negative review from the host saying that we had ruined the bed linen with dog hair. 

The host said that we were disrespectful for having the dogs on the bed and that we ought to have brought our own bed linen with us. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed at the situation, but i don‚Äôt think we did anything wrong as there was nothing in the listing about this. We have never had a problem before and have never been asked to bring our own linen to another property. Worried we may be missing some kind of etiquette.

When my uncle came back they refused to give the dog back, it‚Äôs been years since then and my uncle can no longer take her back.

Yesterday, she had a huge problem with breathing and it looked like she was using other muscles to be able to breath. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs pushing me to give her away, as when i told them to take her to the vet they said they don‚Äôt want to spend all that money‚Ä¶ yet they‚Äôre the ones who caused her to be in this position in the first place. 

So WIBTA for giving her away without their knowledge? I dont want to but it feels like there‚Äôs literally no other way for this to go. If it continues i dont see her living. ",1.0,1.0607993602752686,1,1

I (20s) have a friend we'll call Kelly (50s). I lived with her for a while, I paid towards rent and utilities. It turns out Kelly hadn't paid electric for quite some time and racked up thousands of dollars, for which I cashed out my 401k to pay. The electric bill is unusually high for the size of the apartment, but she declined to ask the company to look into it and they wouldn't give me any info as I'm not on the account.

I moved into my own apartment (electricity is legit 10% of previous bills). 
I had to put her car on my insurance and I pay for it.  I have been helping her with rent and continue to pay towards her electricity and internet. Her car broke down and requires thosands of dollars of work because she failed to get it inspected and drove it into the ground. 

We worked in the same field, I worked 50 hrs a week, she worked 40. She was recently fired for the second time from the same company on suspicion of being intoxicated at work (work with vulnerable individuals). She would call out last minute,  not show up, show up late, fall asleep on shift and has had incidents where we could not wake her up.

My other friend thinks I should stop supporting her financially but I think it would be cruel as she now has no job. The last time she was fired she chose to drink all day and not look for a job. She ended up requiring hospitalization and I'm afraid the same thing will happen if I don't continue to help her. I frequently only have $20 a week to my name after paying her and my bills.

Kelly says I owe her since we lived together. When she becomes upset she lashes out at me, has told me to get my meds in order and has called me names like freak.

I feel obligated to help since she took me in when my family disowned me, my relationship with my family has barely started feeling functional again.

79,1d3i8q3,AITA for indirectly calling my roommates irresponsible?,"**EDITED for Name Clarity**

  
I (nb 27) moved to an apartment with my best friend Brooke (f28), her husband Leo (m27), and another friend Rich (m26) at the beginning of April. Both Rich, and Leo do not have jobs and neither of them are actively looking for one.

Any chores Leo does, he does after being asked/reminded several times. He uses all of his free time to do nothing but play video games all day, probably some 12-15 hours a day. He doesn't go to bed until 3/4am most nights.

At our apartment now, he continues this behavior while both me and Brooke work 8 hour days during the week.

Richard is Leo and Brooke's friend, but I've known him for around 2 years through mutual friend groups. Although he no longer has income, I was assured he had enough savings to cover his rent for a year. I expected a certain degree of responsibility since he lived alone previously. Since moving in, he has done exactly what Leo does.

I'll admit that Leo does more chores than Rich because Brooke pesters enough for Leo to do it. Rich, as far as I have seen, has done next to nothing. Maybe put away the dishes from the dishwasher a few times. Both Brooke and I have not seen him do a single load of laundry since living here, which is just gross.

Financially speaking, the rent is broken up so that Brooke & Leo contribute the most as a couple toward rent because Brooke pays for both of them with her income and as a result have the primary bedroom, which makes total sense. I wanted the only other bedroom that had an attached bathroom so I was willing to pay more than Rich, who had a smaller budget than I did. While my bathroom is attached, it is also the smallest of all 3 baths, while Rich does not have an attached bath, but it is technically the largest. When rent was initially discussed there was a strong implication that Rich would pick up the slack by contributing with cooking & cleaning.

I decided to micromanage rent and utility payments because I have extreme anxiety of late payments. I created a group discord for us so that I can remind them of upcoming payments and other things regarding the apartment. I also order the groceries every week.

With the lack of cleaning during the week, I have taken up cleaning most of it during the weekends.

We are heading into our third month of living here and there's a huge pile of boxes in the corner of the living room that Leo & Rich were tasked with unpacking and clearing out.

All of this and other minor things leave me often frustrated and exhausted and feeling resentment. In the discord, I was probably a little mean-spirited about it, but I labeled the admin role that I gave me and Brooke as ""responsible"". Both Leo and Rich are pissy about it, but they haven't approached me directly about it.

I had gotten us all McDonalds and since my cousin is young and unable to feed themself, I took the time to feed from the front passenger seat I ate. During this time, I placed my uneaten meal onto the dashboard in front of me. My Mother, the driver, said nothing about it.

An hour later, my Mom was still driving- we were exiting a parking lot at a restaurant. She makes a quick, sharp turn out of the parking lot, pushing the (remnants) of my McDonalds, in the bag, off the dashboard and into my lap. Nothing fell from the bag, nothing spilled. Seems totally fine, right?

First words out of her mouth were ""You did this to me!"" although what exactly I did is still unclear to me. Following that was a 45-minute rant from her as we drove home, picking at every aspect of my life like I'm some rat to dissect and dispose of. I tried to cut in several times to say how that made me feel, only to be met by responses such as ""Well, how do you think I feel"" and ""So? I gave up everything to care for you"" which only furthered my discomfort. Not to mention, my cousin in her carseat had to witness all the onslaught.

A month later, Mom kicked me out. Last words she spoke to me being, and I quote, ""I don't love you anymore, don't come back."" I took what I could and left immediately.

She began to call and text threats, that's when I realized, I still paid for the internet and phone service at her house. I had begun paying it around 18, to ""help support the household"", even though I was in highschool with two part-time jobs. But I didn't even live there anymore! So I went to the shop and got it cut off and refunded.

My Mom ended up getting her husband to pay for a new phone and upgraded wifi for the house, all while continuing to bash me in-private and on social media. I started receiving texts from family members, asking why I 'terminated' HER service with no warning. A lot of them came at me for the 'illegal' activity of turning HER service off without warning.

I've always been OK with the way things are but now that the cost of living has gone up I'm starting to really struggle.

85,1d3hi9o,AITA for starting to use my sisters tactics against her? 17M,"My entire life my older sister (now 20F) sister has used backbiting/slandering tactics against me. I used to be loved and appreciated by my family, and she hated that. Beginning 3 years ago she would begin taking every one of my tiny mistakes and amplifying them, making it a huge issue. I was never really aware of this, I thought the best of her and my family. I wasn't well versed in any type of manipulation of uses of language.

But recently I began reading up and noticed the horrific changes in my life. Less trust between me and my parents, and less compassion. And I realized through some slips of my parents and sister that they believed I was a pathological liar, that I would sneak my devices into my room and do porn, that I would sneak out. They would make jokes or not allow me to do certain things that could lead to one of the actions above.

So recently I began doing the same. First I just called her out on her lies, and never let her sit with them alone without me. Every time she would talk about me I would call it out. Then I had a sit down with my father to discuss. He said she was just emotional and upset that I've always been the loved child. I can understand that I suppose. But is it fair to make me feel like a horrific kid to make her feel better? I started making her issue bigger and calling her out for every mistake. She and I had this ""trust"" thing going on, where whenever she did something wrong I had to keep it a secret. But when I did something wrong, she would use it against me. I stopped that, she once cussed in front of my little brother, and 7-year-old cousin and I asked her to apologize. She didn't, so I called my parents and let them know. She said ""You always make Gay jokes with your cousin how could you! I'm going to tell them everything that you do""   
  
From then on I realized if I treated her like a sister or a trustee my life would be destroyed. I'm not good with balance, I'm black and white. Even when I try to be balanced. So slowly I became cold with her, no deep discussions, no trust, nothing. Every time she made a mistake I called her out immediately and made it a big issue. She would get hella pissed but I didn't stop. I have to always remind myself that she isn't my site. No sister would do this. She will act so kind and nice one day, then I will be nice back. The next day she would completely flip around and catch me off guard. I stopped being nice back to her. I always remember that she isn't family, she isn't my sister, she doesn't have my respect. She acts like a child, and will get into physical altercations with my younger brother (which I always break up). I apologize for the long explanation. But am I the ass hole for starting to make her seem like the bad guy? Talking to my parents about her bad qualities? Its disgusting, and I hate doing it. But I don't know what else to do.

86,1d3hho0,AITA for going through my fiancee's phones?,"I (28 female) and my fianc√©e (36 female) have been together for 3.5 years and just recently got engaged this february. Things have been pretty great over the last few years - of course we had some hiccups but nothing serios, nor has she ever given me a reason not to trust her. Well, after we got engaged, things started changing about a month later in March.  
  
She started acting distant, going to bed really early (we typically go to bed at 2 am, she started going to sleep alone by 9:30-10Pm), got a new phone and suddenly became very possessive over it, took more late night shifts at work (which would be fine if I hadn't already known she HATED working nights so its odd that she has been on board about them), and in general, her behaviors have been very odd.  
  
Essentially I thought if she is not hiding something, why is she acting like a guilty person? I tried bringing her behaviors up to her but not in an accusatory way. She always got defensive, said I do not trust her, and in general would get very upset that I even questioned her. So to avoid that, I really tried to let it go. I did.  
  
I tried really hard to not think about her odd behavior, or how it felt like she was growing apart from me even though we just got engaged. I still do not know what to think.  
  
A few days go by and we take our dog for a walk to a local coffee shop. When we get there, we run into this woman who was my fianc√©e's ex friend. Long story short, my fianc√©e blocked her because she did not respect our relationship, or boundaries. So, they have not seen each other or been in contact for years (as far as I knew). When we saw her it was so awkward... I could feel my fianc√©e wanting to run away from her, which made me feel weird. The girl also barely acknowledged my existence, which told me a lot. The situation was so awkward - the girl kept trying to talk to my fiancee, but my fiancee kept walking away with our dog trying to get rid of her. I just don't understand that behavior? I get it was awkward because they had a falling out, but to react so negatively makes me think something was going on.  
  
Any time I would bring that situation up, she would get mad at me again and claim that I am looking for issues. I let it go, but I didn't.... her behavior, mixed with her phone usage made me think it was time to check her phones. I am not proud of doing so. I have not gotten to look too much on her new phone but since being together, she has gotten 2 new phones so there's 3 phones in our home that are hers.  
  
I expected to find something, anything that would validate what what I feeling. However, what I found was probably worse to me? While for the most part, she has not ""cheated"" on me... she has lied about a LOT of things to me, and for years.  
  
For instance, I found messages between her and one of her good childhood friends whom I've met, really liked prior to this, and would often invite over. They exchanged messages that were very sexual and flirtatious before my fiancee met me. We met in oct of 2020 and these texts were from august of 2020 which has left such a sour taste in my mouth. I am not upset that the two of them were flirty, and I do not think I would've been upset if things went further than that between them.. that happened before I was in the picture. But what upsets me is, she has been lying to me about it for the past almost 4 years. If she were to have told me this was her friend that she had sex with, or flirted with, or whatever, when we first got together or a long time ago... I would have had the choice to accept that or not. But now it feels like this woman is apart of my life too. She and her husband (yes shes married) are moving closer to our town because she misses family, but that gives them more of a reason to see each other.  
  
Am I being unreasonable? They have been friends for at least 15 years and from what I can tell, they have taken ""girls trips"" together (where its just them without her husband) and spent a lot of time together. It all looks really bad imo. Again its not the fact that they had something in the past. I do not stay friends with people I have a sexual interest in, but I know not everyone is me and I could've accepted that if she was honest. Now, everything just feels spoiled for me. I worry every day that she's gonna cheat on me with this girl. If she was not looking to have an affair with her ever, why couldn't she just tell me they were involved? that's what stumps me. Both of them are lying.  
  
On top of that, my fianc√©e ALWAYS initiates conversation with her and 8/10 of the times, she ignores her. My fiance sends her memes and tiktoks and the girl leaves her on read. She sends her messages telling her she is hoping she's okay and taking care of her mental health (which is fine) and the girl does not even respond. It's very clear this this is a one-sided thing and its my fiancee putting in the most work, which makes my stomach drop. am I being insecure?  
  
I feel so stuck about this. I want to talk about it with her but I know it will lead to a fight. I would also have to explain how I knew about them being involved. That was only one thing I found on one of her phones.  
  
On her very old phone, I discovered so much more. She was in a friends with benefits situation with a previous coworker who was very much straight and leading her on. This happened between 2019-2020. This woman clearly treated her like shit, but my fiancee was very obviously a simp for her. I think my fiancee was also kind of her Sugar Mama/Daddy? The way she talked to this girl... the way this girl had my fiancee's heart... it just felt gut wrenching. My Fiance called her beautiful a lot, told her how special she was, how she would make sure her and her son were okay... I don't know why but that broke me a bit.  
  
I found out that this girl is blocked on all of my fianc√©e's social media which I appreciate, but she did not block her until 2022 when we were already together almost 2 years. I think this girl broke my fianc√©e's heart. In one of the messages, my fianc√©e writes her and says she loves her so much. I just want to mention that according to my fianc√©e, I am the first and only woman she has ever loved.  
  
I also discovered that my fiance has been deleting messages from whatsapp, having secret conversations on facebook, and just moving sneakily.  
  
one more thing I've noticed... at night time, when she thinks I'm asleep, I feel her turn to her side and reach for something. Sometimes it sounds like a phone, sometimes it sounds like a vibrator. I feel I have been awake next to her while she self-pleasured on a day where I was anticipating intimacy but got rejected by her because she was ""tired"".  
  
I don't know. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read a stranger's sad life. I feel really stuck and not sure how to move forward, what to say, what to do, and just how to feel comfortable around her. I feel like I don't really know her and its my own fault, I should have never snooped. I don't think I will be in peace for a long time. I don't know what the best approach is to this situation because I am not ready to tell her I went through her phones. Maybe this is my karma.  
  
I really am struggling.

I found out that this girl is blocked on all of my fianc√©e's social media which I appreciate, but she did not block her until 2022 when we were already together almost 2 years. I think this girl broke my fianc√©e's heart. In one of the messages, my fianc√©e writes her and says she loves her so much. I just want to mention that according to my fianc√©e, I am the first and only woman she has ever loved.  
  
I also discovered that my fiance has been deleting messages from whatsapp, having secret conversations on facebook, and just moving sneakily.  
  
one more thing I've noticed... at night time, when she thinks I'm asleep, I feel her turn to her side and reach for something. Sometimes it sounds like a phone, sometimes it sounds like a vibrator. I feel I have been awake next to her while she self-pleasured on a day where I was anticipating intimacy but got rejected by her because she was ""tired"".  
  
I don't know. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read a stranger's sad life. I feel really stuck and not sure how to move forward, what to say, what to do, and just how to feel comfortable around her. I feel like I don't really know her and its my own fault, I should have never snooped. I don't think I will be in peace for a long time. I don't know what the best approach is to this situation because I am not ready to tell her I went through her phones. Maybe this is my karma.  
  
I really am struggling.

87,1d3hgrw,AITA for not taking my nieces and nephew to the beach? ,"My sister left her husband and is living with my mom. She has 3 kids (6m, 1.5 y, and 4 y old). I have two kids of my own, 5 & 7. My wife and I have tried to help out when we can and have been spending a lot of time helping my sister get back on her feet. We have also been helping my mother financially.  

My wife and I go away and visit her family for almost 2 weeks a year around the 4th of July. They have a home on the beach, and since my wife doesn't see her family as much, it's time for her and our kids to reconnect. We also fly, and it's over a thousand miles away to visit, so traveling is an ordeal with my two kids, and it's expensive right now. 

My sister heard we were still going, and she's panicking about how she and (our) mom can handle her kids for two weeks. Also, my mom started with how it's unfair that my kids get to go to the beach and my sister's kids can't and wondered if we could all go. I said no, it's my wife's family, and she doesn't get to see them that often, and it's not fair to her to take it away. My sister and mom started talking about how they had money and could afford to host. This comment pissed me off, and I told them to stop thinking you can rely on other people's money. I told them since I'm going on vacation, I will not be helping my mom and sister with June/July bills, and they need to figure it out. It's been six months, and my sister needs to pull herself together. I'm also not helping as much with childcare because both are ungrateful. 

My mom was shocked at my attitude, but I feel so used and upset that they would even ask that of me and my wife.

88,1d3hehn,AITA for not letting the dog sleep in my bedroom?,"Our dog typically sleeps downstairs in the living room in its crate. But today the AC downstairs broke, and it's really hot in the summer where we live; even with just a fan it's still way too hot. So my parents said that the dog would have to sleep upstairs where the AC still works, and that at the minimum it would be one week until the AC is repaired.

There's 3 rooms upstairs- my parents', mine, and my sister's. The hallway upstairs is too narrow to fit the dog crate, meaning that it would have to sleep in one of the rooms. My (20m) sister (16f) said that she doesn't want the dog sleeping in her room because sometimes it barks randomly in the middle of the night, and it also has an accident from time to time. I said that I also didn't want the dog to sleep in my room for the same reasons. But my sister said that since she said it first there is no way the dog sleeps in her room. I asked my parents if the dog can sleep in their room, and they said no, because my dad has to wake up early for work so the dog would bother him. I said that I also didn't want to be bothered by the dog barking or risk having an accident on my carpet. My sister insisted that because she said it first, it's only fair if the dog doesn't sleep in her room.

I pointed out that a couple years ago we got the dog because my sister wanted a pet and the rest of us weren't really passionate about it. It ended up being my mom who took care of the dog most of the time. I said that because she was the one who wanted the dog it should sleep in her room. Then she got defensive and said that as a guy who's 4 years older than her, I shouldn't be arguing with her, and that I should ""be a man"" and let the dog sleep in my room. I said that being fair is not about age or gender, but simply each person pays for what they want. My parents said that because of my dad's work schedule, the dog absolutely cannot sleep in their room, so my sister and I must come to an agreement by tonight.

 Background:I (24f) am currently 35+3 weeks pregnant with my ex-partner (23m). We work at the same small shopping center and I found out a few days ago that he had been talking to another girl from a store there (it started off as completely harmless chit chat and then he started to confide in her with worries he had rather than talking to me about them). I have since found out that she had kissed him while we were together(we broke up once i found out)and he lied about it. One our colleagues found out that this had happened and rather than coming to me about it, spread it around our workplace (no one has yet come to me about it or admitted to knowing until I have confronted them and they have fessed up to knowing). I am only aware of who had originally been told as my ex-partner had rang me to say that a rumour was going round which wasn't true, it was just this individual being jealous and trying to ruin things and had told certain people. He then told me the next day that it was indeed true as I was on my way to work. Although things are tricky right now between us due to the breakup, we have been really good at keeping that separate from anything relating to our baby. We still live together as it is not finacially viable for either of us to move out as houses/flats are way too expensive right now and neither of us have family near to be able to move back home.
Here's where I may be the AH: I know that he still has messages from this girl on his phone although he has said that there's been no interaction between them since it happened as they've both admitted it was a very big mistake and neither of them actually feel that way for each other. I have also seen he has recieved messages from another girl aswell as his Snapchat constantly notifying him of messages, all from girls. I know we are no longer together and it's none of my business now but there is a part of me that wants to look at the messages to see if 1)he at least told the truth in the end about the girl he cheated with 2)if she was the only one and 3)if he was talking to these girls while we were together. We only officially broke up 2 days ago so it wouldn't be a big jump to assume that if he is talking with these girls  like that now then he was probably doing so while we were together.

I move in with a girl 26F (I‚Äôm gonna call her Kim), she had me added to the lease as she was worried I would cause damage and she didn‚Äôt wanna be stuck with the entire security deposit. 

Kim got a boyfriend about four months ago, and around that time she started smoking cigarettes. I‚Äôm allergic to cigarette smoke, not deathly, but it makes my eyes itchy and puffy, my throat and mouth get itchy, and its even caused me to break out in hives on numerous occasions. 

I told Kim and asked if she could please smoke on the balcony as allergy pills aren‚Äôt enough and I can‚Äôt constantly take benadryl because it makes me sleepy. She said she would, but then started smoking in our shared bathroom. I once again asked her to please smoke on the balcony or even switch to vapes if she had to smoke inside.

The first night her friend was here, we were planning on going out to the club. Before going out, we decided to pregame some shots beforehand in the communal kitchen (we are living in a flat, so we have our own individual dorm rooms with a communal kitchen upstairs). My girlfriend and her friend got way too drunk, and my girlfriend ended up puking in the communal kitchen sink. I told her she should clean it up before we leave, and she said okay. She was very drunk at this point, so right after the puking happened, her friend pretty much helped her down the stairs and they just passed out in her room. I went downstairs a few minutes later to check on them, and my girlfriend was just asleep and barely responding, and her friend said she will watch her. I ended up just going to bed as well with the puke still in the sink 

The next morning, one of the other flatmates woke up to the disgusting sink. He complained to the landlord, who notified our study abroad program advisor. The landlord checked the cameras and confirmed it was my girlfriend who was responsible for the mess. Both me and my girlfriend got in trouble, and we were banned from participating on the class trip to Madrid or studying abroad anywhere else through our school in the future. I tried fighting it, claiming that I should not be held responsible for someone else's mess just because I was present in the kitchen at the same time, but that's a whole other story.

My girlfriend got mad at me because she said that I knew she would get in trouble. She said that it ""would have been the right thing to do as a boyfriend"". 

Some context, my girlfriend has had multiple incidents in the past with alcohol where she could not handle her drinks.

95,1d3gy80,WIBTA if I canceled plans despite money being involved,"I (21f) am currently going thought a lot of major changes all at once. Graduating college, moving, starting full time job. Last month, while I was still in school, and living in a different area, a friend had invited me to join them + some friends to go to a convention in Columbus towards the end of the summer. 

I‚Äôll admit, I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôll probably work‚Äù without more research, but this friend is somewhat flaky so I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. Flash forward 2 weeks and one of the other people going has now booked a nearly $600 hotel room (To be split between 4(maybe 5?) people). This happens about two weeks before I move to a different city and begin working full time. 

As my friends start discussing more and more plans for the convention (cosplays, etc, etc) I‚Äôm realizing that there‚Äôs a lot more I didn‚Äôt consider. The thing I‚Äôm most concerned about is the fact that is about a 5 and a half hour drive from my new city to where the convention is. I am not a very good driver, with two accidents last summer and absolutely no experience driving on trips longer than three hours.

Beyond my lack of driving confidence, since it is such a long drive, I would have to take a day off of work just to make it to the convention at a reasonable time and still go for at least 2 days. (Since the hotel stay is for Friday-Monday). 

The bottom line is, I‚Äôm seriously considering how ‚Äúworth it‚Äù it would even be at this point to go. My friend has invited another person since we lasted talked about it, and of the 4 other people going, I really only know one person. 

It‚Äôs still about 3 months out, so I‚Äôm really considering canceling, but I can‚Äôt shake the fact that since the hotel has been paid for that people will be expecting me to pay a portion (for the record I haven‚Äôt yet because I‚Äôm waiting on my first paycheck). Would it be unreasonable to cancel?Or ask that they invite a different person if they‚Äôre depending on an extra person to make the hotel more affordable. Or have I already committed myself haphazardly? 

It‚Äôs really racking my brain and I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point.

I‚Äôll admit, I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôll probably work‚Äù without more research, but this friend is somewhat flaky so I didn‚Äôt give it much thought.

As my friends start discussing more and more plans for the convention (cosplays, etc, etc) I‚Äôm realizing that there‚Äôs a lot more I didn‚Äôt consider. The thing I‚Äôm most concerned about is the fact that is about a 5 and a half hour drive from my new city to where the convention is.

My aunt and uncle live right next door.  We have a big family reunion coming up in 3 weeks that will be hosted at the 2 properties.  This past weekend my brothers and I were going up there to help get a bunch of things ready.  Yard work, planting flowers, putting docks and boats in the water, etc.  

Last week I was talking with my oldest brother and I told him my wife and I were going to come up as well and bring our 2 sons (3 & 1).  He asked if it would be possible for me to come up by myself because the weather isn't going to be great and this isn't going to be a ""fun"" weekend, it's a ""work"" weekend and he knows if my entire family comes up then I won't be able to help with the projects much.  I told him that he and his wife are bringing their 5-year-old son and my kids want to see their cousin.  

We ended up not getting there until Saturday morning because we were exhausted Friday night and didn't want to make the 2-hour drive.  Not even 5-minutes after we arrived, my wife threw her back out carrying one of our bags upstairs.  She tried to take some pain meds but they didn't help much so she was pretty much immobile.  

We tried to keep our boys occupied in areas that she could still watch them, but our 1-year-old just started walking and my mom's house isn't the most kid-friendly so he requires a lot of attention.  Everyone else was already busy so I had to watch my kids.  

Sunday morning my wife woke up and her back was still in rough shape.  We decided it would be best if we just headed home so my wife could rest and it would be easier for me to watch the kids.  We were all packed up and ready to go by noon.  

My brothers and uncle were putting a dock and boat lift in the water when we were about to leave.  They were all in the water in waders because the lake is still really cold.  I went to tell them we were leaving so they could say goodbye to the kids, but they didn't want to stop what they were doing.  My oldest brother made a sarcastic comment about thanking me for all of my help.  I explained that my wife was in a lot of pain and it would be easier for her to rest at home.

Albert announced a major life event three weeks ago but only told us the specifics two days ago in the group chat. He then called me privately, explaining he couldn't invite my girlfriend due to a 50-guest limit and budget constraints. That he didn‚Äôt want to say it in the group chat because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt my girlfriend. I was driving, so I said okay and hung up. He later DM'd me with more details.

Not wanting to exclude my girlfriend, I politely told Albert I preferred not to come and explained my reasons. He reacted with a ""haha"" and said it shouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal since we're not married yet, which I found hurtful. I believed a heads-up during the planning stage would have helped.

Tony validated my feelings but thought I overreacted, reminding me of my past reckless behavior in relationships.

The co-worker (60f) that helped me get my job position, was furious.

Before I could explain to her the situation, she blew up on me and the other head department and said none of this matters and to stay in my own lane and that all the boxes were going to be thrown away. I was shocked by her outburst.

The co-worker has her boxes done and also had one left and this movement probably rubbed her the wrong way, however, I do not believe I deserved to be yelled at. 

With that, the following day she confronted on me and said that I messed everything up. I tried to calm the situation down by explaining my side and what my process to sort it out was, but she abruptly told me to stay out of her way and left. Now there's this tension between us and as she is also overseeing my hourly wages, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of us being on bad terms with that dynamic between us.

Along with this I have said I will not be making plans during the day on weekends for 3-4 weeks leading up to the exam. I am fine making plans into the evening since I do not study effectively in the evenings.

She is now talking about going out for the day in 2 weeks. I reminded her that I won't be making plans.

She said it's not fair to refuse to make plans at all for a month but I just pointed out that these exams are important and that I'm not completely refusing to make plans, I'm still happy to make plans in the evenings.

She just said I shouldn't be this inflexible and should be more open to compromise but I just pointed out that it was only a month and that I need to be focused on exams and weekends are the only time for me to study as I am still working full time during the week.

My coworker‚Äôs (56M, let‚Äôs call him Dave) wife was kind enough to make 2 huge pans of biryani, crispy onions and a homemade yogurt which was delicious. 

After the potluck there were leftovers, so we all brought some home and I guess Dave left everything he brought, including the serving spoons, at work until the next day. 

After everyone took their leftovers there was about two servings left in one tin so I asked if I could just take the whole tin home (it was one of those Dollarama pans that you throw out after). He gladly said yes! 

I come in for work the next day and Dave asks me if I had seen the serving spoon he brought yesterday and I said no, I helped him look for it in the kitchen and we couldn‚Äôt find it so I said I‚Äôd double check the tin I took home. I get home and it‚Äôs not there.

He texts me asking about it and I tell him it‚Äôs not there, he insists I check again and I just didn‚Äôt respond. 

The next day at work he asks about it again, admittedly I was kind of getting annoyed because it‚Äôs a spoon? How expensive could it be? I told him I already checked and I don‚Äôt have it.

Just to keep this all short as possible no one besides my mom and boyfriend showed up to my college graduation. So finally today I sent a group chat to my Brothers expressing that I was truly hurt that they didn't come.

I told them that I wasn't literally going to give them the bird I was just going to walk which was something my advisor said I'd never do. 

Where my boyfriend comes in is they have not really talked to me since I moved in.

They said they would never support my decision to move in with him. I told them that I know some of the things they've done and I never once judged them for it. They replied they weren't judging me but just trying to steer me in the right direction. I said I wasn't going to jump into a marriage neither me nor my boyfriend were comfortable with especially when we know literally no one who hasn't been divorced at least once. Or goes into a marriage fighting and having huge issues. Which was in a way calling them out specifically. 

But I'd rather go into a marriage knowing it's going to last then fighting and struggling to save the marriage every day. They aren't talking to me again. For more context me and my sister in law were close before I moved and would talk almost every day. This all stopped when I moved. Which is when they said they started to fix their marriage and stopped talking to everyone. But still boycotting me and not talking to me when I constantly text them and try to have a conversation with them it's always well talk when you get to town or one word answers from them.

111,1d3d815,AITA for refusing to pay the extra ¬£35?,"I moved back in to my mothers house to share the bills as we're both now on a low income.  The house was an absolute state as she has neglected it.  An outside wall was crumbling and falling off in chunks, letting water through, causing mould and damp inside.  She gave me 2 bedrooms (one to use as a bedroom, one as my own sitting room) both of which were mouldy, damp and crumbling with big holes in the walls down to the bricks, and the carpets were damp and smelly.  The hallways and stairs carpets were damp, smelly and mouldy.

We agreed I'd pay ¬£600 a month, which she intends to use to pay her credit cards off.  She used to be a very high earner but frittered all her money away on her hobbies, saved nothing and now she's retired and on a pension.  She also recently went into debt to give my sister a house deposit, she maxxed out her credit card for that.  So now she's in a financial pickle and is going to use the ¬£600 a month I give her towards the credit cards.  

I had ¬£13K in savings, and I used it all on house repairs recently.  I fixed up her house at my own expense as well as paying her every month.  I got the outside wall of the house fixed (the builder said it would have fallen down in a couple of years, it was that bad), and the outside of the house painted (which she really wanted), and the inside walls replastered and repainted, new laminate floors and a new hallway carpet.  I now have no more savings.  Despite all this she ignores my contributions and repeatedly claims that she pays for everything.

They finished installing the carpet today.  They told me any door alterations were included but they left with one door still not closing (because the new carpet and door bar are higher than the old ones).  We phoned about it and they said it wasn't included and they would charge an extra ¬£35 to come and alter it.  I was outraged because they made out it was already included, and said that we shouldn't pay it.  But my mother is too lazy to fight things, and has this weird thing where she refuses to argue with men.  She paid the ¬£35 (remember I paid for the carpet and everything else) and said I owe her it because I ""wanted the new carpet.""  I said no, because I never agreed to pay it and I would have fought it.  Also it wasn't that I wanted to buy a new carpet but that the old one was filthy as she let her dog poo and wee all over it and her cat scratch it to shreds, and people walk all over it with their outdoor shoes and it was over 15 years old anyway.  It also smelt damp and mouldy.

She angrily yelled ""Oh well I'll pay the ¬£35 then, just like I pay for everything else!""  She thinks I'm in the wrong, I think she is as I would have fought the extra charge and I'm annoyed she always claims to pay for everything.  AITA?

",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-29,"AITA for refusing to pay the extra ¬£35? I moved back in to my mothers house to share the bills as we're both now on a low income.  The house was an absolute state as she has neglected it.  An outside wall was crumbling and falling off in chunks, letting water through, causing mould and damp inside.  She gave me 2 bedrooms (one to use as a bedroom, one as my own sitting room) both of which were mouldy, damp and crumbling with big holes in the walls down to the bricks, and the carpets were damp and smelly.  The hallways and stairs carpets were damp, smelly and mouldy.

We agreed I'd pay ¬£600 a month, which she intends to use to pay her credit cards off.  She used to be a very high earner but frittered all her money away on her hobbies, saved nothing and now she's retired and on a pension.  She also recently went into debt to give my sister a house deposit, she maxxed out her credit card for that.  So now she's in a financial pickle and is going to use the ¬£600 a month I give her towards the credit cards.  

I had ¬£13K in savings, and I used it all on house repairs recently.  I fixed up her house at my own expense as well as paying her every month.  I got the outside wall of the house fixed (the builder said it would have fallen down in a couple of years, it was that bad), and the outside of the house painted (which she really wanted), and the inside walls replastered and repainted, new laminate floors and a new hallway carpet.  I now have no more savings.  Despite all this she ignores my contributions and repeatedly claims that she pays for everything.

My department hired a new GM last year and one item on their agenda was seperating our departments website from the primary website.  This task was delegated to the one website person from our marketing team - my colleague - ‚ÄúJonathon‚Äù. 

With no opportunity for anyone in our department to review a draft, Jonathon sent a new website live. It had many errors and inaccuracies, incI our businesses name being wrong. I was asked to pause my entire ordinary workload and spend the next 2 weeks exclusively on collaborating with Jonathon to get the website up to scratch. 

I met with Jonathon and discussed how I planned to collaborate with him. I asked for access to the platform and said I would make minor changes as needed but would refer significant changes to him as the SME.

Initially, I did a deep dive with stakeholders to define the full scope of the new website, something Jonathon hadn‚Äôt done. The scope of the site at LEAST doubled. At the end of scoping, I sent an email, a text message and tried to call Jonathon to review the change in scope and plan how we would be collaborating to complete the required work. No response. 

I continued calling with no answer for the remainder of the week. Monday of week 2, I decided I was done waiting for a response. If Jonathon wouldn‚Äôt work with me in a timely manner, I would get the job done on my own. 

Although I am not employed or qualified in anything to do with websites, I happen to have skills in digital media and with this platform from personal projects and so I went all out during week 2 with a full revamp of the website (as per my GMs specific scope), leaving little to no trace of Jonathon‚Äôs previous work. 

On Friday afternoon, I delivered the project and my GM was exceptionally happy, sharing the work with department heads and execs. 

On the following Monday, I arrived to work to a scathing email from Jonathon with tons of big CC‚Äôs in claiming I had gone rogue and destroyed his initial work. He claimed I overstepped my authority and mismanaged this project in an attempt to show-off and that I intentionally rushed the work through by myself to make him seem incompetent or inferior. His leaders seem to have his back, agreeing the way I handled the project was incorrect and that I shouldn‚Äôt have been making decisions around aspects of the design or technical details which I wasn‚Äôt employed to be making. 

I believe I did what was necessary so I could deliver on my due date and could get on with my regular work. While I had no malicious intent towards Jonathon, it certainly crossed my mind that doing this could be problematic for him, but promptly decided that wasn‚Äôt my problem. 

Did I overstep? Should I have tried harder to find an amicable road forward?

For context, the setup is a little strange, being a double garage attached to a house where another family lives with the upstairs portion of the two garages converted into apartments. The place is nice, freshly renovated with a shared laundry unit in a backroom in one of the garages.

The laundry room is the current issue. Our neighbor (40ishF) takes up the one washer and dryer for hours at a time throughout the day. More times than I can count on two hands has she left her laundry to rot for DAYS and we've had to move it so we can do ours. 

This specific problem arose yesterday before me and my bf went to the beach around 5pm, he moved her stuff to the dryer as it had been sitting in the washer for who knows how long, started our load and we went to the beach. Getting back around 7-8pm we went to switch our laundry to the dryer and was confronted with her same load from before, my boyfriend was tired of it and just tossed it onto the table next to the dryer to put our load in. I come back around 10pm before bed to take our finished load upstairs. This morning around 9am (16 hours after we put her stuff in the dryer) after I left for work I get a text from my boyfriend saying the neighbor is screaming about the laundry in the shared stairwell saying how she ""works too hard for her stuff to be touched"" and ""if it happens again I'll make a phone call!"" And I'm concerned that if she makes said phone call she'll leave out the important detail that she leaves her clothes in the unit for hours on end or the landlord will call us out for touching her stuff.

So I wanted to ask, maybe it's obvious and stupid, are we the assholes for even touching her stuff in the first place? I know it sucks to have your stuff touched but she needs to learn how to share.

We live 6 hours drive away from my husbands parents aka my in laws. They used to live with my husband‚Äôs elder brother, his wife and two kids in a typical joint family setup because the entire family (except for the kids of course) worked at the same factory which was situated just outside their home.

Just recently the elder brother decided to separate from the family and business because it became very toxic for him as my in laws are very demanding and controlling. 

We supported the brothers decision because we knew exactly how his parents are and they are super controlling down right to the colour of the curtains that will be there in the house.
The elder brother struggled with depression for a long time because of that and along with the help of his wife he finally erupted and walked out on them.

The day he moved out, there was a huge ruckus and they called us crying to come there asap but since my husband has just started a new job he refused plus we knew they just wanted us there so that we could convince the elder brother to come back. My husband gets anxiety being around his parents for the same reasons as his elder brother and he just didn‚Äôt feel like going. 

So all this continued for a whole month, they would call us crying and venting about how lonely they are now and that they are not having their meals and all. Somehow all that started irritating me a lot because I felt they were trying to emotionally manipulate us. 

Eventually the elder brother finally decided to move back but in a different home that will be built in the same property and that the two families will work at separate timings at the factory, all this was my in laws idea as well because they just didn‚Äôt want to let go of the elder brother and I guess he gave into their emotional pleas eventually. 

So after all this happened we eventually told them that we are off for a vacation in June and they started giving us silent treatment after that. Because according to them we are assholes for not visiting them when they needed us.

The truth is that we were saving our holidays leaves at work because we were scheduled for a vacation in June and also because we were pretty damn sure they wanted us to go and convince the elder brother to come back. 

We asked them to come to us because when all this happened we were moving houses and jobs and it was easier for us to host them here than travel there. 

Are we really the assholes? I feel guilty and angry at them at the same time. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I have been married a decade. There are times I have made cultural missteps, but I don't think loving Jake and trying to protect him is one of them.

She said this was the legacy of white supremacy and colonialism that I had picked up in my childhood (my parents were aide workers) so I couldn't see it and I have a lot of unlearning to do. At this point, Tom and her husband walked in from the garden and Tom could tell I was upset. Stacy quickly suggested they needed to leave.

I have been married a decade. There are times I have made cultural missteps, but I don't think loving Jake and trying to protect him is one of them. I did tell Tom and he said Stacy is ""being the white savior"" and laughed. I don't think he gets how much I worry. I guess I just need reassurance. AITA, reddit?",0.0,0.0635332241654396,0,1
119,1d3bo0b,AITA For calling my mother ugly? ,"Firstly sorry if this doesn't make sense, English is not my first language.

As the title says I (16m) called my mother ugly.

Background: my Mom (42F) | don't like describing my mom like this but my friends always say my mom is a milf.

A week ago me and my friends were playing video games at my house, my house is pretty huge and we have a entertainment room in the basement.

When ever my friends are around they always mention how sexy my mom is and it really infuriates me how they talk about her, this happens all the time when my mom picks me up from school sometimes, the single Dads will always flirt with my mom or all the older boys will thrust their hips in my moms direction when she isn't looking.

I see my mom as a beautiful, kind and hardworking mom who always has time for me and my siblings, my mom doesn't dress too obscenely but she does not dress modestly either it's somewhere in the middle.

As mentioned before me and my friends were playing video games at my house when my mom came down to give us some drinks and snacks.

Once she had left the room my friends started talking and mentioned how sexy my mom was and got into real detail of what they would do to her, it made me sick and I could feel my face getting hot and I just exploded and shouted out that my mo was ugly and not sexy.

Right then my mom was walking back into the room, so she only heard me shouting out that she's ugly not what the rest of my friends had said before.

I don't remember much of what happened after, my head was hurting and my face just felt really hot so I must have went to my room.

I didn't go downstairs for dinner I was too afraid to look at my mom, but in the morning all of my family was downstairs eating or making breakfast.

Saturday morning breakfast is family time in my house so my dad (45), my twin brother (16), younger brother (13) my two younger sisters (10) and my mom Were at the kitchen table.

I thought my Dad would tell me off or worse my mom would be cold towards me but they both looked up at me and smiled and then my mom told me to come and eat since I must be hungry.

I didn't know what to do, I was ready to apologise to her as soon as I saw her but the words wouldn't leave my mouth. Plus my mom was smiling but it didn't reach her eyes, I could tell she was sad but she didn't want to show her sadness.

It's been a week already and she still treats me the same, we still have movie nights and mom and son days. I just feel so bad right now.

I already know I'm the asshole, I just want to know what I can do to make my mom happy again.

And yes I did just create an account today to just to ask this. 


UPDATE:

Many of you have stated the obvious, that it is indeed not my moms fault and also that I have shitty friends.

I have send them all texts the day after it happened letting them know we are no longer friends and not to come over to my house ever again and then I blocked them. 

My twin brother used to be friends with them but suddenly stopped talking and hanging out with them. 

During school today I asked my brother why and he pretty much said that they said disgusting things about women. Which horrified me. 

As most of you pointed out my mom is an amazing mom and she raised me better than to hang out with degenerates like them. 

I told my twin about what happened and he told me to tell Dad and that he will be there with me while I tell Dad what happened and why I said it. 

Well I told him and I have disappointed him incredibly it hurt seeing him disappointed in me and I was crying. 

My Dad said that mom is his wife first before she is my mom and he was very upset to hear I had degraded my own mother. 

I am gearing myself up to apologise to my mother, I got her favourite flower from my local garden centre that Dad drove me to. It's an orchid she loves so very much. 

I know no amount of apologise will ever make my mother forgive me. Seeing as I could not defend my own mother I feel i deserve it.

120,1d3bkxv,AITA for calling my girlfriend a germophobe when she complained about my hygiene?,"So I (27m) had a small cut on my lip, probably from dryness. I had just washed my face, so it was particularly dry. When I laid down, she (30f) noticed that there was a small bit of red on my lip. I wiped it with the back of my hand, leaving a small mark of red on my hand (like maybe an 1/8 inch circle) which I smeared with the other hand, leaving the small amount of blood invisible on either hand. 



She immediately freaked out and pulled all the blankets and sheets off, immediately throwing them into the washer just on the off chance that i touched them. She left home to get away from me, and said she was having a panic attack at the thought of all the things i may have touched. She says that I have horrible hygiene for this reason (and no other reason). Note: we make out all the time, we have sex often. We sleep together every night. She has been exposed to every germ in my body. 



I know she's super sensitive to germs. She has had anxiety attacks simply over the idea that I may have touched raw egg once on accident and touched something else in the kitchen. If I drop a piece of pasta on the ground, she will grab paper towels and lysol and decontaminate the area. Simply picking up the food isn't enough. If I get a smudge of sauce on my hand while cooking, she'd get anxiety from me wiping it on the hanging kitchen towel rather than wash my hands. If that kitchen towel now had a miniature stain on the top of it, you'd no longer be able to dry your clean hands on the rest of it. If I brush my teeth and rinse, but wipe my mouth on the handing towel she says ""you're getting your saliva all over it! (My mouth is closed) That towel is for hands only!"". Shed then replace the towel. If I kiss her stomach over her shirt playfully she'd complain that I'm getting saliva on her shirt. 



Even knowing all this, I didn't exactly realize she'd react that way to blood however. I called her a germaphobe. She claims that she isn't, and that it's completely normal for people to react that way to blood. My reasoning is that it's a complete overreaction over that small an amount of blood. You can't see the blood, smell it, feel it, sense it in any way. Regardless, it's making her anxious. 



I understand anxiety. I don't mind going out of my way to treat blood in any from like it's a deadly virus just to ease her anxiety. I do believe that she's an actual germaphobe. She claims that she isn't, and that me calling her that is just to invalidate her and continue my nasty habits. I'm not *unwilling* to cater to her demands about hygiene to be clear. I *am* absolutely of the belief that she should acknowledge that everything I'm doing for her is above and beyond to alleviate her own (unnecessary) obsession.

AITA for believing she's a germophobe? Furthermore, is it a disgusting habit to wipe an invisible amount of blood onto my sleeve or is my hygiene really that bad

I recall once incident where she asked the kindergarten teachers to use the bathroom by pointing at the bathroom passes, only for them to tell her that if she wants to use the bathroom, she has to ask for it verbally. She couldn‚Äôt bring herself to speak out loud and she snuck out of class to use the bathroom, and returned to the two teachers reprimanding her for sneaking out of class. As for Lola‚Äôs parents?

One time a classmate told her she was spoiled because she met Lola‚Äôs dad and he was really nice, and Lola just said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs only nice because he was in public‚Äù.

They have supported us in every imaginable way in the past and still do and are ready to help us whenever we ask for anything. Even for my wife they are really like family, not in-laws who are there to annoy your ass and complain like stereotypical in-laws. When we talk about them both of us say ‚Äûour parents‚Äù not ‚Äûyour parents‚Äù, and I have the very same mindset about her father.


tldr - I didn‚Äôt help my wife with cleaning and wanted to do my part later, she got mad.

I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible. For context- usually at Tuesdays all of all(me, my wife and our kid) drive together to and from work/school. At 4PM kiddo has soccer practice so one of us go with him and the other person has time to relax/do sth. Since I took him for other activities on other days, my wife usually takes him on Tuesdays and I use my free time to cook dinner and meals for the next day. 
This week was different - due to my doctors appointment we drive to work separately and my wife had to pick up kiddo from work and deal with him till I come back - which took longer than expected, I was back around 6PM. Additionally, my parents decided to visit us(starting from Wednesday late evening) so we knew we must clean the home since we didn‚Äôt have time to do that last weekend.
When I came back from my appointment I met my wife with angry-tired face while mowing the lawn. I went home, spoke to kid and called my parents with him. My wife came inside little later, told me she‚Äôs gonna take care of kids bedtime. I proceeded to cook and gather stuff she left outside and went upstairs to workout. She came to me after few mins asking if I could vacuum and I told her I‚Äôll do that when I finish working out. She got mad for me not following her with cleaning and after few mins she came back complaining I should help her and skip my workout. Once again I told her I‚Äôll do all things when I finish and she can tell me/write me down most important things for her and go to sleep but it didn‚Äôt help, she even suggested I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do simple things like changing sheets. We went silent after that, I finished my workout, found a list of chores downstairs which she mostly did by herself so I did what was left(I fixed living room and kitchen, segregated laundry) and went to sleep. Morning was awkward and she clearly thinks I should drop whatever I was doing and help her. 

We don‚Äôt have any chores split- she does more typical home chores and I do more financial stuff and spend more time with our kid. I also cook 95% of the time for like 2 months now, before that it was 50/50.
For my defence - she has tendency to focus on less priority things which are often time and energy consuming like mowing while ignoring important stuff and later being mad we didn‚Äôt focus on that before. I didn‚Äôt want to exercise later because it would be too late for that and I would prolly pass in that.

My wife came inside little later, told me she‚Äôs gonna take care of kids bedtime. I proceeded to cook and gather stuff she left outside and went upstairs to workout. She came to me after few mins asking if I could vacuum and I told her I‚Äôll do that when I finish working out. She got mad for me not following her with cleaning and after few mins she came back complaining I should help her and skip my workout. Once again I told her I‚Äôll do all things when I finish and she can tell me/write me down most important things for her and go to sleep but it didn‚Äôt help, she even suggested I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do simple things like changing sheets. We went silent after that, I finished my workout, found a list of chores downstairs which she mostly did by herself so I did what was left(I fixed living room and kitchen, segregated laundry) and went to sleep. Morning was awkward and she clearly thinks I should drop whatever I was doing and help her. 

We don‚Äôt have any chores split- she does more typical home chores and I do more financial stuff and spend more time with our kid. I also cook 95% of the time for like 2 months now, before that it was 50/50.
For my defence - she has tendency to focus on less priority things which are often time and energy consuming like mowing while ignoring important stuff and later being mad we didn‚Äôt focus on that before. I didn‚Äôt want to exercise later because it would be too late for that and I would prolly pass in that. On Wednesday(today) we still will have enough time to get everything ready before my parents arrive so I didn‚Äôt feel and rush was necessary.",1.0,1.0446398258209229,1,1

However.. she has a younger sister who doesn't really have a plan... She currently lives with her and pays the majority of the bills and cleans up after her, feeds her ect. This sister has a pretty heavy drinking problem and some other issues, and I know in my heart I could not live with her, even temporarily.

So the sister is already hinting that she can't afford to even rent a room on her own (doesn't want a full time job) and floated the idea of living between us and others (she has family/friends close) for 'a couple of weeks'. There didn't seem to be a plan in place at the moment for what to do generally. I think my gf is by far her preferred option out of the people she could crash with. What's making me uncomfortable is I can see there is a lack of boundaries between them, no talk of any plans in future. She has bipolar and I suspect other issues which I think is relevant.

The thing is, I have somewhere to stay already and I'm quite happy here on my own, I wouldn't be happy in a housemate style situation.

He knows my ex M28 and knows the fact that he comes from a family that is very comfortable financially. My current bf is average when it comes to finances and so am I, so it's not a problem for me.  

My ex used to love to give me gifts. I have some nice jewellery that he gave me. We've been together for 4 years so there's a lot of stuff that he gave me. We parted amicably, no drama at all, we just grew apart and there are no feelings on either side. I offered to give him back the gifts when we were breaking up because some of them were expensive but he insisted that I keep them. He gave it to me because he wanted me to have those things so he will not have it back. I like the jewellery and, since there are no bad feelings to associate it with, I kept it.  

I've never worn said jewellery when with my current bf because it's on the fancier side and we've never been anywhere where such accessories would be appropriate. We mostly go hiking, a pub or just hang out at home.  

My bf saw a pair of earrings on my make up organiser. He told me they were nice and asked how come I never wear them. I told him they were diamonds and I don't wear them on daily basis. He jokingly asked me how I can I afford diamonds of this size on an accountant's salary and I told him these were a gift from the ex. He asked me why I still have his gifts as we broke up over 2 years ago and asked if there were more. I told him yes, there was more and I kept them because I like them, I'm not going to throw away nice jewellery just because I'm no longer with my ex. If there was bad blood between us then yeah, I probably would but it's not the case and my bf, being a part of my friend group, definitely knows it. 

We had a fight and he went home. He's been acting cold and eventually told me to get rid of the gifts. I told him he was being childish. He's saying either I get rid of it or we're done. AITA for not wanting to get rid of perfectly good things and nice jewellery? Just to clarify, I do not keep contact with my ex and there are no feelings involved.

Soon after we broke up and I moved out I found out that he hadn't eaten in a couple of days and so I gave him the login for my McDonald's account so that he could use my points and get himself something to eat. I didn't ask him to do anything in return I just wanted to make sure he ate. Nevertheless he topped up those points a few weeks later when he was dealing an at home poker game and ordered McDonald's for everyone.

I noticed that all my points where gone again and I thought that was a bit strange. I asked my ex if he had used them and he said he had so I asked him to top them up again when he had a chance. This caused him to go off on one, saying that it's ridiculous that I'm asking him for some pesky points when he will never be able to be financially stable again because of me and he wouldnt be lying in bed this depressed if it wasn't for me. 

Some background information for context. We moved in together around July last year along with his best friend a man so bad with money he was 35k in debt. My exes name was on all the bills but rent and while I tried to help where I could it was difficult to do so as whenever I got paid his best friend would try and come up with a sob story for financial aid and my ex would take it and spend it on delivery food. My health at the time was also not great so I went through two or three jobs while we where together. This situation along with the fact that his best friend kept skipping out on rent before eventually moving out became the reason we eventually split up. It got even worse when over Christmas he lost two grand in a poker game and I had to work as a sugar baby so that we could even afford to eat that month. It is also important to note that before we met his credit score was already shot because he has a massive gambling addiction. And that since we broke up I have been trying to pay off mass amounts of credit card debt that I am in mostly because of him.

Anyway so back to the present. He went off on me saying I actually owe him even more money and saying he would take me to claims court. Eventually coming to the conclusion that I owe him around 6 grand and demanding that I pay him at least 1.5k immediately, which he knows I can't do since I'm living paycheck to paycheck as it is. I know he is being unreasonable but at the same time I can't help but feel that the reason he blew up like this is just built up frustration caused by me.

Soon after we broke up and I moved out I found out that he hadn't eaten in a couple of days and so I gave him the login for my McDonald's account so that he could use my points and get himself something to eat.

But this bothers Hannah, and at every family gathering she corners me to compare notes on how hurt she is about something they‚Äôve done or haven‚Äôt done. I try my best to console her but I don‚Äôt really understand what she‚Äôs upset about. I know it all probably stems from the fact that Hannah is NC with her own family due to trauma, and probably thought she could marry a replacement family but at the same time, I think that‚Äôs mildly delusional. The problem is she tries to lump me in with her in terms of being upset about the lack of ‚Äúlove‚Äù from the in-laws and I have to politely tell her to leave me out of it.  

Last weekend at a family gathering she again pulled me aside and said that she hadn‚Äôt received any gifts or cards from the in-laws for her birthday.

135,1d39dyz,AITA for blaming my mom for my parents divorce?," 
I'm a 32yo male who's parents recently got divorced. I grew up with a great childhood and both my parents did their best to give me great memories and contribute to my adulthood career success. My mom unfortunately has strong narcissist tendencies which eventually contributed to my dad not being able to healthily handle living with her without affecting his personal health and physical well-being (work related injuries with consistent PT). Unfortunately this behavior has also affected her relationship with my wife, and here we have the classic wife/mother-in-law relationship. We have both tried to apologize for our own behavior in different situations of blowing our cool, however the feelings on my mom's side are still festered. 

After they divorced, my dad moved out and was mentally distraught for the feeling of failing his marriage dispite the circumstances. I helped him for a long while balance his emotions while maintaining his job. Unfortunately, consciously or unconsciously, I didn't communicate with my mom much until about two months later, she experiencing around the same type of emotions. During this time however, my dad constantly reached out to me for help and my mom was waiting for me to reach out to her. 

During a forced conversation between her and I, I admitted that I felt and personally experienced she was a major contribution to the divorce. Her rebuttal was that it was nobody's fault, it just naturally fell apart, and that I didn't have any right to blame anyone since the split was between them. 

As of today, my mom wants me to apologize for what I said, and generally doesn't want to talk to me until then. I just really can't get myself to take my words back since it's what I truly feel and experienced firsthand as a young adult since I can remember I could rationalize and understand this type of behavior. 

Today, my dad has been apart of almost every family gathering in my wife's side of the family, and some of our mutual friends gatherings which has helped his healing process. Unfortunately my mom is naturally more to herself and I feel has not been healing well.

136,1d39asm,AITA for taking my 4 year old son into the girls changing room,"My (f37) son does swimming lessons after school. He's 4 and struggles to get dressed on his own after swimming. The swimming pool is not set up for families. There's a changing room with a girl's side and a boy's side attached to the pool. There is also a 'family changing' room that is not attached to the pool and would require you to walk through the school to get to it. The 'family changing' room is also the adult's toilet. So there's not much space in there, and it's not uncommon for it to be in use.

The first couple of weeks, I tried using the family changing room, and we ended up stuck waiting, then having to change in a recently used, not very clean toilet stall. With tired kids, it was just a nightmare.

I've been sending both boys (6m and 4m) into the boys' changing room to get their swim stuff on. The 4-year-old can (mostly) do that himself, but he's just not quite there with getting dry and dressed on his own yet. So, after swimming, I take him to the girls' changing room so I can help him.

Usually, we end up being the last ones to go in, but today, the boys were hungry, and we went in pretty quickly. I was in a corner, getting my kid changed, when another mum started yelling at me. She wanted me to be in the boys changing room with my son, as my son ""was making her daughter uncomfortable."" We were doing a quick change, he wasn't running around naked I was between him and the rest of the changing room. Her daughter was more uncomfortable with her mum yelling than my son's existence (the 6-year-old girl asked her mum to stop several times).

I didn't respond to her much because I'm not super confrontational. I just focused on getting him changed and letting him know he was okay.

She started yelling louder that ""she didn't consent for her daughter to see 'that'."" I got annoyed at this point and said, ""She doesn't have to look."" I know this didn't help, but I was getting frustrated. After that, I mostly didn't engage as she kept berating me and my son. I just got him dressed and out as quickly as possible. 

I am now second-guessing myself. I don't understand why it would be better for an adult to be in the 'wrong gender' changing room than a pre-pubescent kid. That's what she wanted. If I had been a Dad with a daughter, she would have been apoplectic. If she had spoken to me calmly and politely, I would have engaged with her, but her reaction felt ott, especially in front of the kids, so I didn't try to reason with her.

During her yelling, she said that I should just go in the boys with my son like the nannies do, so maybe I am totally in the wrong here. I never noticed that they do that, as I don't pay much attention to what others are doing when I'm with my kids. My expectation is that until kids can be on their own/sort themselves they go with their adult.

137,1d397l2,AITA for leaving without explanation after MIL pretended not to hear me,"I 32F have a 7mo daughter with my husband 34M. My country does ensure a long maternity leave for up to 2 years, however I am self employed and cannot afford to lose my clients so I try to work while my daughter is sleeping and during the weekends. Lately she's been teething so I'm operating on little to no sleep.  

I have an issue with my MIL. She does what she wants despite people asking her not to and then says 'oops' or denies doing it. Things like that. It was annoying before the baby but after she was born it has become insufferable. Husband talked to her and set boundaries, so she stopped doing that when my husband is present but she was still doing it when it's only me in the room. So we agreed she cannot visit when husband is not at home and husband is not to leave me alone with her.  

Because of these boundaries we did not see them for 1.5months. They live 2hr away and we did not find a mutually good time. They finally came over last Sunday.  

20min into the visit my FIL wants to see a lawnmower that has broken down so my husband goes into the backyard with him, leaving me, the baby and MIL inside. She's drinking coffee and eating cake. She sits next to my daughter on her playmat and tries to feed her some of her cake. I immediately told her no, she can't have that. MIL pretends not to hear me and proceeds putting her spoon to my daughter's closed mouth. I repeat stop doing that, she can't have cake yet and definitely not from your spoon. Still she pretends not to hear me. I repeat it again, still nothing and now there's cake on my baby's face and she's fussing. So I grab my daughter and go to my husband and FIL, subtly gesturing him to come back inside.  

After about 5mins MIL decided to go outside too and was approaching me and the baby. I gestured to my husband again and he made an annoyed face. I had no energy to deal with any of this so I stood up, went inside, grabbed baby bag and car keys and went to the car without saying a word. MIL asked me where I was going and I ignored her.  

I drove to my sister's, which is about 15min drive. There were some missed calls from my husband so I texted him where we were and that we'll be back in the evening. It was time for my daughters nap and she fell asleep breastfeeding so my sister told me to go sleep too. After she woke up and had her milk my sister took her and told me to go back to sleep. I slept ~3hrs in total and my phone was on silent so my husbands calls were ignored and apparently his parents left disappointed and MiL cried.  

My husband is furious I did this. We're still fighting about it. He can't believe I was so rude and took the baby away when his parents came to see her after such a long time. He's angry I couldn't have waited a few minutes so that he could finish talking about the lawnmower. I told him I'm too exhausted to deal with this shit.

138,1d39328,AITA for being frustrated with my mom who thinks I'm lying about being bisexual?,"I, 21F came out to my mom 45F when I was 17 years old as bisexual. It wasn't completely thought out at the time, I was very heartbroken and distressed from having been turned down by a close female friend I had a crush on for many years. (Said friend turned me down very kindly, there's no drama there, we're still friends). I was ready to be berated and my mom to freak out but she didn't, she was very supportive and good to me and told me she still loved me the way I am. 

She's still the only family member who knows I'm queer. My dad's...I wouldn't call him entirely homophobic, he's not the kick out your kid because they're gay kind, he's the ""it's all in your head, you're making this up"" kind. He's a good dad but I don't think he'd accept this with open arms like my mom did. 

In the present, I was set up with a guy who was a mutual friend. We'd been talking and been friendly in passing, and our friend came up to me and said that he likes me and that he might ask me out. He did ask me out and I accepted. I hadn't really thought about him like that but I decided to give it a go. Long story short, the date didn't go well, it was very awkward and we were both too introverted and didn't have a lot in common. A week later, I ended things and he agreed. 

I was telling my mom about this in a resigned way. I don't really date much and I wasn't expecting this to go well because I was never really into him like that anyway, and I told her I should have turned him down in the beginning. 

Then my mom got alarmed. She said ""Aren't you bisexual? Aren't you supposed to be into guys?"" I thought this was weird and said, ""Yeah I'm attracted to men. I just wasn't into this one."" 

My mom goes on, ""But you're bisexual. You're supposed to be attracted to guys too."" I was getting irritated but I explained to her that that's not how sexuality works. I don't HAVE to be into every one I date. She still didn't seem to get it and was like, ""I don't know. When you told me you're bisexual I thought you'd still be into boys. Are you a lesbian now?"" Her tone was a little frightened? Like she was hoping I would say I'm not a lesbian? 

I was frustrated and said that I don't want to discuss this with her if she's going to act this horrified about me possibly being a lesbian. Then she snapped and said that she wouldn't be saying this if I didn't lie about being bisexual.

I might have been too harsh. She might have just been worried about me hiding my sexuality from the rest of my family who won't be as open as her. But it hurt and made me scared when she looked so horrified at the thought of me liking only girls. I'm worried I alienated the only family member who might have been on my side.

He did ask me out and I accepted. I hadn't really thought about him like that but I decided to give it a go. Long story short, the date didn't go well, it was very awkward and we were both too introverted and didn't have a lot in common. A week later, I ended things and he agreed. 

I was telling my mom about this in a resigned way. I don't really date much and I wasn't expecting this to go well because I was never really into him like that anyway, and I told her I should have turned him down in the beginning. 

Then my mom got alarmed. She said ""Aren't you bisexual? Aren't you supposed to be into guys?"" I thought this was weird and said, ""Yeah I'm attracted to men. I just wasn't into this one."" 

My mom goes on, ""But you're bisexual. You're supposed to be attracted to guys too."" I was getting irritated but I explained to her that that's not how sexuality works. I don't HAVE to be into every one I date. She still didn't seem to get it and was like, ""I don't know. When you told me you're bisexual I thought you'd still be into boys. Are you a lesbian now?"" Her tone was a little frightened? Like she was hoping I would say I'm not a lesbian? 

I was frustrated and said that I don't want to discuss this with her if she's going to act this horrified about me possibly being a lesbian. Then she snapped and said that she wouldn't be saying this if I didn't lie about being bisexual.

I might have been too harsh. She might have just been worried about me hiding my sexuality from the rest of my family who won't be as open as her. But it hurt and made me scared when she looked so horrified at the thought of me liking only girls. I'm worried I alienated the only family member who might have been on my side.

139,1d38gu6,AITA for naming my daughter after my MIL ,"I'm very close to my MIL. I met her when I was 12 and she was more of a mother to me than my own mother was. Both my ILs are great and FIL is more of a father to me than my father is. But this is focusing on MIL for the post. I'm forever thankful for her. My husband is very close to his mom as well. When my husband and I got married MIL actually walked me down the aisle after my grandparents who were supposed to do it didn't show up. So she has been an amazing support to me in the 16 years that I've known her.

As an adult I am no contact with my parents and lower contact with my grandparents since the wedding incident. The reason they didn't show up is because I refused to invite my parents for appearances sake.

Anyway, when my husband and I found out we were expecting a baby we had tossed around the idea of naming her after MIL. I wanted her name to be special and to have a story and real meaning behind it. My MIL has a Rose name and she always wanted to be Rosie but another nickname stuck when she was very young. So we decided if we had a girl we'd name her Rosie and after finding out we were expecting a girl, Rosie became the firm choice.

We told nobody about the name until we had her. MIL and FIL came to the hospital to meet her which is when we told MIL, as she was holding her namesake. She was so happy and FIL was overjoyed for her.

But not everyone loved it. My grandparents were angry when they heard about the name because I honored MIL and not one of my parents. My SIL was also annoyed. SIL named both her kids after FIL (daughter has the female version of his name, son has FILs middle name as a first name) and BIL named his son after FIL too. Our daughter is the first and maybe only child who will honor MIL. So my SIL feels like I did this to try and make her and BIL feel bad and/or to try and make my daughter the favorite for MIL. My husband said she was being ridiculous and MIL was so upset when she found out what her daughter had said.

But the backlash surprised me (not as much from my grandparents but from SIL for sure). SIL blamed me because she said if I hadn't been okay with it my daughter wouldn't even have a family name. She told me I was being a bitch to her and BIL and the other grandkids.

140,1d38erd,AITA for not inviting my best friend to my first rave?,"April (34F) and I (34F) have been best friends since childhood, but lately, something's been bothering me. She's a seasoned raver, hitting up all the well-known music festivals, while I've never even been to one. And not once has she asked me to join her.

Now I finally have an opportunity to go to a rave with my boyfriend (33M) of two years, who's into EDM, but also hasn't been to a rave before. But here's the thing: I'm torn about inviting April.

On one hand, she's my bestie, and it would be great to share this experience with her. But on the other hand, I can't shake off the feeling of being left out all those times she went without me. She's gone to raves with her boyfriend and with her other set of friends that I know. It's like, why should I invite her now when she never bothered to include me before?

I made the tough call not to invite her. It's not about payback or anything, just wanting to enjoy this moment with someone who's as excited about it as I am. April has expressed that she's hurt that I didn't invite her, and that weighs on me. But I also want her to understand how I felt when I wasn't invited.

I hope she can see things from my perspective and understand that this isn't about excluding her, but about finally getting to experience something I've always wanted to, with someone who's equally enthusiastic. Am I the asshole for not inviting April to my first rave?

Edit: I get why some might think I‚Äôm in the wrong here, but let me provide some context. Over the years, I‚Äôve always been interested in raving and even invited April to go to a rave with me before. However, she declined, saying she was already going with her other group of friends. Despite that conversation, she never extended an invitation to me afterward.

To add some background, I‚Äôm a bit of a late bloomer when it comes to raving. I had very strict parents growing up and only moved out and became independent at 24. Honestly, it hurt not getting an invitation, especially since I get anxiety going to big events alone and she‚Äôs my only friend who raves. I thought I could rely on her to share this experience.

This isn‚Äôt about payback; it‚Äôs about finally experiencing something I‚Äôve always wanted to with someone who‚Äôs just as excited as I am. I hope this helps explain my decision and why I chose to go with my boyfriend instead.

141,1d38e9i,AITA for drinking and relapsing even though my SO asked me not to?,"My husband and I spent a few weeks with his family last month. I‚Äôve had a drinking problem in the past, which he was aware of, but I stopped before I went too far as in I threw out all the alcohol in the house as soon as I started calling out work from hungover, and never looked back. There were some rough times but I didn‚Äôt really go through a formal recovery process. Which was the reason why he thought I had my drinking under control and that I wasn‚Äôt a full blown alcoholic. Although I was getting drunk every day on my own, he had to sit me down saying he‚Äôs worried about me and he felt alone because I was passed out drunk almost every single night.

Until this time his family pressured me to drink on multiple occasions. His uncle was giving me whiskey shots being all ‚Äúlive a little‚Äù, his dad was making toasts and gave me a beer. My husband, instead of defending me he went ‚Äúyeah she can drink‚Äù which encouraged them into pressuring me more. I eventually drank because well why not, and also a bit out of spite. His mom is allergic to alcohol and when she took a few sips he vocally stopped her saying she shouldn‚Äôt drink, so he did have it on his mind about who should and shouldn‚Äôt be drinking, yet he put me on the spot with his family knowing my history. I‚Äôd also be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt want to drink, I did‚Ä¶which made me realize I‚Äôll always be an alcoholic. 

Here‚Äôs where it got funny. My husband got upset again because I was drinking too much with his family. I reminded him that HE put me on the spot, HE told everyone I could drink and encouraged me to do so. He said he thought I had things under control because I haven‚Äôt had a drink in over a year so he thought it‚Äôd be okay, I told him his intentions are not my problem, just the fact that if he was the one who encouraged it he has no right to be upset. He still said he hates my drinking, that I should stop and he‚Äôll never encourage it again, to which I asked what I‚Äôm supposed to tell his family to avoid drinking because he EXPLICITLY TOLD THEM I COULD. He said he‚Äôll explain and will defend me, I was beyond furious at that point and said I‚Äôll literally take the next train home if he tells people I had a drinking problem. He said he won‚Äôt do that, he‚Äôll just tell people to stop asking me to drink.

I shrugged and left it at that. Next day at lunch his uncle poured me a beer, which he took away from me and told them to stop giving me drinks. His uncle looked confused asking why he‚Äôs suddenly acting that way, I felt pretty uncomfortable for reasons I can‚Äôt explain and just politely told them I wasn‚Äôt hungry and took the pup for a walk. Later I asked my husband to please stop acting like that because nobody understands why he‚Äôs all of a sudden acting that way and it‚Äôs just making everyone uncomfortable, which he said he‚Äôs aware of his own action. That went on for the remainder of the trip where he literally body checked everyone who tried to hand me a drink, people getting all confused about that reaction, and me just overall feeling super weirded out by it for no reason. Thankfully no one asked me what was going on, I really wouldn‚Äôt know how to answer that.

My sponsor tells me I‚Äôm the ass in the situation, that I took the drink because I wanted one, I continued drinking because I wanted to, that it sounds like I blamed it on my husband and used it as an excuse to relapse. My husband thinks I was drinking to punish him, or at least partially was to punish him for putting me on the spot.

143,1d385x5,AITA for calling my housemate a liar ,"
My housemate reversed into my car 5 weeks ago smashing a tail light and damaging a bumper that will require paint repaired. This car is my most valuable possession and also holds a lot of sentimental value, it‚Äôs nothing fancy or expensive but it‚Äôs special to me.

He had been going through insurance but last week opened up to me about his financial struggles and being broke and said he couldn‚Äôt afford to pay his excess and wasn‚Äôt going to put in the claim. He is a University Student who works part-time and I have a lot of compassion for people suffering from financial hardship especially whilst studying as I have been in that position in the past. 

In order to help him out I agree to let him purchase and fix the taillight himself (he has limited mechanical experience) and I‚Äôll organize to have the bumper repaired and resprayed and he will pay for that. This should work out a bit cheaper than his excess but it‚Äôs a lot more work for me getting quotes and organizing the work compared to dropping it off with an insurer which would also be a much faster turnaround.

He claimed he would purchase the light in the next two weeks so I can resume driving it (I don‚Äôt drive this car other than to get worked on currently) and pay for the respray sometime later.

Roughly 5 days after this agreement I overheard him discussing his cryptocurrency holdings which are worth $6000. 

This made me extremely angry because it made me feel as if had been lied to and had my empathy and compassion taken advantage of. 

I instigated an argument feeling the need to stand up for myself. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs acceptable to claim to be ‚Äúbroke‚Äù while having a crypto wallet with that amount of money in it, I struggle to interpret this as anything other than him being dishonest and lying to me.

His response was based around him believing there was nothing dishonest in his claim of being broke and that it doesn‚Äôt count as money.

He also claimed his ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù are none of my business. And that $6000 isn‚Äôt a lot of money.

Having been genuinely broke before I just can‚Äôt bring myself to understand how someone can believe $6000 in liquid assets = broke.

I also strongly hold the opinion that it‚Äôs not okay to hold liquid investments if you owe people (friends/family) money as it equates to selfishly using people as free capital- and to me, this is similar to that. 

I have no anger towards him regarding the car or how long it‚Äôs taken- these issues are tolerable, All of my problems with this situation are based on feeling like I‚Äôve been lied to and having my trust broken. This will likely be the end of our friendship if it can‚Äôt be resolved.

Their friends had recently been to Japan, and we were talking about their trip. My boyfriend mentioned that I really wanted to go to Japan. They got excited talking about the places to visit, and my boyfriend‚Äôs mother immediately said she would love to go too. Their friends were encouraging my boyfriend and me to make that trip soon because we are young and would enjoy it more. However, I said that as much as I would love to go, it wouldn't be possible in the near future because my boyfriend and I were looking to buy a house to live in together, as we had been dating for three years.

At the beginning of this year, we finally got our house, but we had to do some renovations and didn't have anything in the house yet, so we didn't move in right away. A month after buying the house, my boyfriend informed me via message (his parents were pressuring him to tell me that day) that this year he was going on a 15-day vacation to Japan with his family. I immediately understood it would be ONLY FAMILY, I was not invited, and it was a thing for just the four of them. I didn't oppose the trip, but I was upset about the situation. My boyfriend thinks I shouldn't be upset because he didn't create this situation, but he also doesn't want me to be upset with his parents and says I should accept it. If the roles were reversed, I believe he would be very upset .

We still haven't moved in together because of this trip. I don't want to be alone in an empty house for 15 days while they are on a trip they know I would love to take. At first my boyfriend didn't understand and wanted to move into our house sooner and after a week he agreed to delay the change.

Whenever I express my point of view, my boyfriend says I'm being dramatic, that if I feel bad, he will also feel bad, and consequently won't enjoy the vacation because i will cause a problem between him and his parents.

146,1d37w27,AITA for telling my parents they didn't give me and my siblings a good childhood?,"I'm (17m) the middle of my parents three kids together. I have an older sister (19f) and a younger brother (15m). My mom has other kids though. She was married before and has kids with her ex-husband. Her other kids are in their 20s and one is 40 or almost 40. I don't really remember him. But the others lived with us mostly when they were younger and it was hell.

My mom's ex was a dick and my parents ended up making a really messy childhood for me and my two siblings. The police and CPS made pretty regular appearances in our lives. Mom's ex called them on us several times. But also sometimes they were called on him and would talk to my mom and dad or the other kids. Mom's ex was arrested from our home so many times because he was showing up uninvited and refused to leave and would start trouble. Sometimes mom's other kids caused trouble and the police had to get involved as well. They hated our dad and they hated us and they would cheer on their dad's antics. Our house was basically a hell house. Three of the people living with us didn't want to be here, my parents were so focused on rescuing mom's siblings from her ex that they didn't spend the time making sure we were okay.

Mom's ex was a dick to us. But my sister got it worst of all. He'd make comments about her being ugly and fat and he'd just be a total creep to her. So we were bullied by a weird ass guy and by people who were also supposed to be our ""siblings"". We used to be so afraid of him and seeing him around because of how acted. And to make it all worse we came last at home. Mom's other kids were the priority, then mom and dad prioritized each other and then the three of us.

The best part of my childhood is when we lived with our grandpa for like 5 weeks during a CPS investigation. He gave us the love and support and attention we missed out on at home. He also tried shielding us from the crazy shit. Our parents never did that. We had an up close view of all this going on. And even when the last of mom's other kids moved out the focus was still mostly on them. We also saw them for Christmas every year and they still hated us so that was always fun.

In the last year it's been different sorta. My parents now like to talk like we're ungrateful because we're not close to them and don't tell them stuff. We don't have the typical parent-kid relationship with them. None of us have any trust in our parents. We go to grandpa if we need an adult. My parents complain a lot about my sister having nothing to do with them and after giving us all a good childhood. I heard that a few times and last time, which was last week, I snapped and told my parents they didn't give us a good childhood and to look back at how shitty things were and how they brought us into a huge fucking mess. My parents called me a selfish, ungrateful kid. My brother backed me up but they were angry with me for saying that. They told me I didn't appreciate them trying their best.

149,1d37f9c,AITA for telling my friend she should brake up with her boyfriend?,"This happened a few months ago but I can't get it out of my head. My friend introduced me to her boyfriend and at first he seemed like a good guy, he was respectful to me and we had some things in common and he was generally pleasant to be with. One thing that caught my attention was that at one point he said that he was in the world of cryptocurrencies but I didn't give it much importance since even though I'm not involved in it I don't see anything wrong with it.

Let's fast forward a few weeks. One day my friend and her boyfriend invite me to his house to play video games since the three of us like them and he is the one who has the most. When I arrive, my friend tells me that we should go to his room to play video games but that he is on a video call with other friends talking about crypto. I nod and we go to his room to play while he is on the computer on a video call, he greets us and we sit on his bed to play the PlayStation while he finishes. For some reason his conversation caught my attention and after a while I approached him and asked him what he was doing since he was laughing a lot and talking very animatedly with his friends. He started to explain to me what he was doing and at that moment I was horrified: he and his friends were ruining small crypto projects for fun. Now, I don't know much but I know enough to know that people invest money and time in doing that and I felt bad.


The next day I tried to tell my friend and told her that if he was capable of doing that to strangers I wouldn't be surprised if he did something to her. Her answer? She yelled at me and accused me of trying to steal her boyfriend, along with some hurtful insults about sensitive topics. Since then I stopped talking to her but recently she came back to me crying saying that I was right and that I had left her and she wanted us to be friends again. I told himno and that he owed me an apology first (she never apologized for the insults and only justified herself). My family tells me to forgive her, that she made a mistake but I honestly can't.

150,1d37d0j,AITA for suggesting that my best friend should break up with her boyfriend?,"My (22NB) best friend's (22F) boyfriend (24M) is terrible in my opinion. They have been dating for over three years and he has progressively gotten worse over the years. When I met my best friend they had already been dating for close to a year, so I feel like it is not my place to suggest this but I just cannot stand watching her destroy herself trying to make their relationship work.  

During the first few months of knowing my best friend (we'll call her J) and her boyfriend (we'll call him C) everything was great. They were the couple everyone envied. After a while, C started to become more clingy, going to J's dorm every weekend and policing her outfits (but only for the gym). This, in my head, was not that weird because we lived in a college town with a large frat population with bad reputations. A few months later C tested positive for STDs but J did not. C refused to acknowledge that he was caught cheating J never pressed the situation further (I did not find this out until much later)

J and C got tested regularly as they used to live a more promiscuous life and C's ex had, more than once, passed STDs to C, so it was his idea to get tested regularly. 

Around the three-year mark of their relationship, C's parents told J that they hated her. This was a complete shock to J as they had always been very nice besides from some political differences that never seemed to bother either party. C did not defend J once while his parents told her she was entitled and treated their son like shit. Also around this time, C tested positive for gonorrhea, J, once again, did not test positive for any STDs. 

At this point, J suggests C seek therapy for his inability to empathize with her. When J would cry to him and ask what he would do if he was in her position he would answer ""I don't know I would never be in that position"" and then go play Xbox. The only time C has ever shown any emotion is when she suggests they break up or they take a break, it feels very manipulative to me. She then suggested they take a break and he flipped out on her telling her that he would not accept a break and that they would not break up. After three months of J being berated by C and his parents, he finally agreed to a break. During this break, C finally decided to go to therapy. 

It was during their break that J told me everything that was happening between them and I was very upset for her. She is my best friend and she deserves a man who will treat her with respect and genuine love and care. Once C proved that he went to his first therapy appointment, J decided to end their break and try to work on things again and he is worse than ever.

C refused to admit he cheated on J and almost gave her STDs on multiple occasions but he freaked out when she had sex with someone during their break. C goes through J's social media likes and reposts and flips out if there is a man in any of the pictures or videos to the point where he will blow up her phone at 2 am waking her up until she either unlikes it or apologizes to him. She wants to have a couples counseling session but he refuses. She texts me every day about how the stress of her relationship is making her physically sick and her anxiety has never been worse in her entire life. I just want my friend to be happy and healthy.

This is where I feel like I may be an asshole. Every time J confides in me, I suggest they she end things with him even though I see how hard she is working to make it work with C. My reasonings are that we are young and have our entire lives ahead of us and it is better to be sad over losing this relationship for a few months to a year than feeling stuck in an unloving relationship for the rest of her life. J has said multiple times that she does not plan on breaking up with him anytime soon as she sees her ""happily ever after"" with C. Obviously, J is not without faults of her own. She is human after all, but she has never cheated (unless you count during the time they were on a break, the classic FRIENDS dilemma) or emotionally manipulated C.

151,1d375zm,AITA for saying no to nights out with my family because they keep pressuring me to drink alcohol? ,"I (22f) don't drink alcohol. I never experimented with it in high school or college (still going to college). I didn't have my first drink when I turned 21. I don't drink at all and I never will. I'm the only alcohol-free member of my family. And I'm treated like a weirdo because I don't drink. My family enjoy nights out with lots of alcohol and sometimes food is included in that too. Whenever I'm with them they buy me alcoholic drinks and try to pressure me to drink. I hate it. I really don't enjoy bars or nightclubs and outside of the few times with my family I never go.

It makes me enjoy spending time with my friends more because they never mock me or pressure me to try alcohol and we also do stuff on nights out that don't involve drinking or at least where it's not the primary focus. It bothers my family that I spend more time with my friends in that way than them. Because I eventually started saying no to nights out with my family.

It got mentioned recently because my friends and I went to this gamers club and a couple of my friends drank and the rest of us didn't. But my family saw photos and made a big deal that I ""go to the bar with those friends of yours and not your own family"". I told them the gamers club isn't a bar and that the reason I don't go out with them anymore is because of their constant pressure for me to drink.

They called it bullshit and they said I'm an adult and if I can't handle teasing then I'm in for a very sensitive future. I told them teasing isn't mocking me every single time they invite me out because I don't want to drink. I told them they turned it into bullying and coercion and it's not okay.

They called me uptight and told me I'll regret mistreating my family someday.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-29,"AITA for saying no to nights out with my family because they keep pressuring me to drink alcohol?  I (22f) don't drink alcohol. I never experimented with it in high school or college (still going to college). I didn't have my first drink when I turned 21. I don't drink at all and I never will. I'm the only alcohol-free member of my family. And I'm treated like a weirdo because I don't drink. My family enjoy nights out with lots of alcohol and sometimes food is included in that too. Whenever I'm with them they buy me alcoholic drinks and try to pressure me to drink. I hate it. I really don't enjoy bars or nightclubs and outside of the few times with my family I never go.

It makes me enjoy spending time with my friends more because they never mock me or pressure me to try alcohol and we also do stuff on nights out that don't involve drinking or at least where it's not the primary focus. It bothers my family that I spend more time with my friends in that way than them. Because I eventually started saying no to nights out with my family.

It got mentioned recently because my friends and I went to this gamers club and a couple of my friends drank and the rest of us didn't. But my family saw photos and made a big deal that I ""go to the bar with those friends of yours and not your own family"". I told them the gamers club isn't a bar and that the reason I don't go out with them anymore is because of their constant pressure for me to drink.

They called it bullshit and they said I'm an adult and if I can't handle teasing then I'm in for a very sensitive future. I told them teasing isn't mocking me every single time they invite me out because I don't want to drink. I told them they turned it into bullying and coercion and it's not okay. I told them I have never tried to stop them from drinking or pressure them to stop. But they won't give me the same curtesy for not drinking.

152,1d374e0,AITA for not washing the dishes? ,"I (22NB) was just woken up by my father (60), allowing  the dogs to come into my room and jump all over my chest (I had top surgery 5 months ago, so the scars are fresh and still hurt a little). He then proceeded to tell me to wash the dishes.

I am unemployed and have been looking for work since the year started. My dad still works his 9 - 5. My mom (65) retired last year and has been pretty much all the housework when the housekeeper isn't here (she comes 3 times a week). I would 100% help my mom with these things if she ever tought me how. She never did and still doesn't want to. So the best I can do is wash the dishes, until I move out and learn how to do all that myself. Sometimes I tell her that I'll wash them and then she'll do it 5 minutes later. This upsets me, because I know that she'll use this later to say that I never wash the dishes. I'm constantly anxious about it. 

Yesterday,  my mom left for a vacation, so, I washed the dishes after she left. My dad came home, fed the dogs and I figured he would wash those dishes (either last night or today), since I washed the other ones. That's because today is a holiday (Voting day).

The first thing I said when I woke up was ""ow"" and my dad just kept letting them jump on me. This made me upset. He responded with ""You're fine"". He came into my room and left the same way, whistling and telling me to wash the dishes. I said ""Why would I want to wash the dishes for you when you don't even care about the dogs hurting me?"". He responded with ""That's so mean"". Que the back and forth, me screaming and raving from my bed (so crazy, right) and him calmly yelling from the living room, telling me to ""stop screaming I can hear you"". 
 
At first I told him ""I'll wash the dishes after waking up on my own time"" (he kept insisting that I do then now). Then I remembered that I washed them yesterday, so fuck him ""YOU can do them, because I can't remember the last time you did!"". He said I don't need to, because I work every day. He then said ""Please, I take you to the doctor for your follow up check-ups on your scars"" and I got even angrier, screaming ""That's your job! You're my parent, you're supposed to do that! It's the bare minimum!""

In between all of this I kept screaming at him to leave me alone, because always, he never listens and never respects my choices. He kept making his comments, almost losing his cool one time, because he's not getting what he wants. He still remained ever so calm.

At some point he said ""be an exemplary daughter and wash the dishes for me"". This after I've made it as clear as I possibly could that I'm not a girl and I never was. ""How many times have I told you I'M NOT YOUR DAUGHTER!"", I  started crying. He apologised and continued pestering me as I was typing this. 

I know I am fully capable of doing them. It's not about that. I don't want to be the only one to do them, since he is just as capable. Tbh, I might have done them if he hadn't treated me like that.

154,1d36rpk,AITA for not celebrating my birthday?,"I (20F) am turning 21 in a few weeks. I don't dislike my birthday but tend not to celebrate it and prefer spending the day normally. My mother asked a while ago if I would be open to having a 21st birthday party in our home to which I declined. She was admittedly upset and tried to persuade me to let her, though I shut it down firmly.

I have many bad memories regarding celebrating my birthday due to my mother's disinterest and controlling behavior. Her disinterest faded when she held my sweet 16 party in our home where she took control to where I had no choice on anything. The day was a disaster in many ways and it has effected me deeply since.

She eventually accepted my rejection but later returned asking if I was okay with her hosting a party a day before my birthday as a celebration for a nearing holiday. I was okay with this and agreed to help out so long as she didn't mention to any of her guests about my birthday. She agreed and was excited to plan a party, mentioning that she'd order a cake for me to cut at the party and for the children to enjoy. While I was confused, I said I'd cut the cake and serve it for the sake of the holiday.

Later today, she informed my dad to get ready to order my birthday cake for the party, to which I asked why there would be a birthday cake at this holiday party. She said that having a cake would be great for the children to look forward to as it'd make them happy. I asked again why it had to be a birthday cake, reminding her that I didn't want to celebrate my birthday and that the cake should have the holiday's name on it instead. She grew irritated and said that as the party would be on my birthday, I should be cutting a birthday cake. I became upset and told her that I didn't want to celebrate that day at all, to which she replied that the guests wouldn't be celebrating my birthday. She explained that she'd bring the birthday cake out while telling the guests that the holiday party and my birthday just happened to fall on the same day. Mind you, she originally told me she'd host the party the day before my birthday, not the day of.

I shut it down and she grew angry, claiming she told the guests it was a holiday party so that they wouldn't celebrate my birthday as per my request and wouldn't bring gifts. I pointed out that the guests would feel bad that they didn't bring anything for me if they found out about my birthday.

My dad told me she was only doing this for me but didn't believe it. I pointed out that if she truly wanted to do this for me, she'd have bought a small cake for us to enjoy privately and not involve it with her holiday party. We argued more and I said if that's how she wanted her party to be, then I wouldn't entertain her guests or babysit their children during the event. She called me a brat and stormed off, saying I ruined everything and that she'd cancel the party completely because of me.

160,1d35njm,AITA for spending time with my family?,"So I (18M) have been dating my girlfriend (18F) for about 3 years now. When we first got together she loved my family and of course my family loved her back but fast forward to now and I feel that every time I hang out with my family she makes an excuse to be angry with me. Our most recent argument started because I went to the movies with my grandfather, cousins, aunts, and uncles to celebrate some recent birthdays in the family. She claims that she is angry because she needed me today and that I should have been there to support her.

For a little bit of context my girlfriend has been going through many struggles with her own family. This past weekend her mother and father got in a fight that resulted in me calling the police due to how bad that it had gotten. I stayed with her for four days afterwards and even slept in her car with her to avoid having to see her parents. Now she is claiming that by me going to the movies instead of spending time with her that I do not care about her because she was scared and wanted me there with her today...
Thave also skipped out on my most recent family trips because she has told me that she'd break up with me if I went. She says the reason why is because I told my family yes to going before consulting her.

FMI: My parents had offered her and her sister a place to stay with us the morning before the movie and she declined. I tried to explain to her that i'm just trying to balance things in my life and she just told me that she wishes i was the boy she wanted me to be and that she should be my #1 priority.

161,1d35k6z,AITA for telling my mother I want my sister to walk me down the (hypothetical) aisle?,"My (25F) mother (59F) got angry with me and told me she wouldn‚Äôt attend my wedding if she wasn‚Äôt the one to walk me down the aisle. 

Trying to be concise here so in short, my parents divorced when I was 5 and since then they have basically not spoken to each other at all. Initially they were amicable with each other but eventually became no contact during my teenage years.
I maintained a relationship with my dad as much as I could however when I was 10 I moved interstate with my mother and older sister (5 year age gap) and so only saw my father on holidays. As time went on the relationship became more and more distant and hollow.

I always thought if I were to ever get married that I would not want my father ‚Äògiving me away‚Äô considering he hadn‚Äôt done much to raise me and didn‚Äôt deserve that responsibility at my wedding. Also I think the idea of a man owning you until they hand you off to another man is just stupid and oppressive. But that is beside the point. I am not getting married, I am not even engaged. 

I am incredibly close with my sister and I trust her over anyone. She is the only person who has always been there for me. Because of that Ive always wanted her to walk me down the aisle should I ever get the opportunity.

During a normal conversation on this topic, I expressed this idea/thought to my mother, a totally hypothetical situation as, again, I am not even engaged. And she became genuinely angry with me. She said that if she couldn‚Äôt do it then she wouldn‚Äôt want to come to my wedding at all. It turned into a full blown fight as in my eyes my relationship with her has always been far from perfect and I think she was blowing a hypothetical scenario way out of proportion. She thinks that if it‚Äôs not my father then it should be her or at least her and my sister. I thought she would have thought it was sweet that I would want my older sister to play that role.
I believe we could have just had a normal, nonexplosive conversation about her thoughts and feelings but instead she got angry with me which in turn only solidified my feelings on not wanting her to have that responsibility.

Curvier myself and had a baby 10 months ago, which has also completely changed by body shape.  

Initially BRIDE wanted mismatched dresses and BRIDESMAID #1 sent us all 3 options to choose from. Then about 2 weeks ago the BRIDE sends me a new dress she wants us to wear. The sisters and the bride have a group wedding chat I am not apart of where they have been sending dress suggestions and discussing but I have not been included in this.  
  
This dress CLINGS to your body, is backless and spaghetti straps. It also only goes up to a size 14 (I am  about a 16) I flagged this and told the bride that since having a baby, a dress like this wouldn't be flattering to my body shape but I would try it on in a 14. She pressured me into trying on the size 12 because her sister had the only 14 available.

The dress instantly made me feel insecure, it's tight and unflattering and makes m feel  anxious and humiliated. I gently told the the bride the dress was too tight and I was not comfortable in it and made me look pregnant. Her solution was to take material from the bottom of the dress and make a belt around my belly, to cover my stomach. I was pretty humiliated by this suggestion but explained that would be worse.

BRIDESMAID #3 offered to swap the size 14 for 12 and wear shape wear to squeeze into it. Grateful for this but still I flagged that this size may not fit and whether there is a back up? I spoke to the MOH and BRIDESMAID #2 about how uncomfortable I felt in this dress and how stressed I was that size 14 would not fit me. I was told to try it and if it didn't work, we'd find something else. 

Today I got a message from BRIDESMAID #2 telling me we are going ahead with the dresses before I've even tried on the 14. I was taken aback. BRIDESMAID #2 doubled downed, told me that we all have body issues, it's impossible to find a dress everyone is happy in, BRIDESMAID #3 is willing to size down, wear shape wear and ""do what she needs"" and that this is what the bride wants and it's her big day.

I'm just so hurt by this response. Don't want to be difficult but I don't know what else to do as this dress makes me feel so uncomfortable. For my wedding, I went to extra lengths to find a dress that suit everyone's very different body shapes, including the BRIDE and I don't think she'd wear this.

The downstairs looked like hell, and my father looked at the camera and saw me chase my dog to wipe her feet off, and then clean up mud from the floors.

I may of lost my source of income because my brother trashed the place, left my dog outside to run around in the mud when I asked him not to, and he didn't even lock the doors after he went upstairs causing a safety issue.

For example, she refused to part with a kitchen island that takes up a third of our living room. She also stores her pots and pans on the kitchen island in the living room. She claims she doesn't want her ""expensive utensils"" scratched by mine in the kitchen cabinets.

Other examples of her quirks include buying a portable dishwasher because she's ""too tired to do the dishes,"" purchasing a massive water heater because a kettle ""takes too long,"" and convincing our landlord to replace the toilet due to ""too much splashback.""

Because of her numerous belongings, she ran out of space in her bedroom. As a result, her items (2 laundry hampers, 2 wicker baskets of purses and bags, 5 plants, workout/yoga equipment, and miscellaneous boxes) have permanently occupied the living room.

The clutter in the common areas has started to bother me. I'm not perfect, but I keep my mess confined to my bedroom. The only item I keep in the living room is my bicycle, which is tucked into a corner.

Recently, she mentioned wanting to adopt or foster a cat. I agreed but clarified that it would be her responsibility. She wanted to place all the cat-related items in the living room, including the litter box, litter and food bags, toys, and bowls. I suggested storing the litter and food bags in the bathroom and kitchen closets instead, which she rejected as inconvenient. I also suggested downsizing some items to make room, which offended her.

She accused me of being unaccommodating and making it difficult for her to get a cat. I explained that her plan didn't work for me as it stood and suggested rethinking the logistics. She became outraged, yelling and being snarky and condescending. She insisted it was partly my responsibility to find solutions for the cat. I disagreed, given her history of weaponized incompetence and the fact that all the clutter was hers and she decided to get a cat.

Throughout the conversation, I remained calm and only became slightly condescending after she started yelling. Eventually, I decided it was best to end the discussion. She refuses to see the common spaces as ""cluttered"". Instead, she accused me of wanting to achieve a ""certain visual aesthetic"" with the place, whereas I simply want it to look clean and organized, and I don't want to see her dirty laundry or crusty uncleaned air fryer when I'm trying to work in the living room.

170,1d3442t,AITA after I got into a fight with my best friend?  ,"I (21F), have been best friends with a girl (22f), for nearly five years. We've always gotten along pretty well up until a monthish ago.

At the beginning of May, I was prescribed Lexapro, an anti-anxiety/anti-depressant. But it really messed me up. I was nauseous and sick for two weeks and I'd be up at all hours of the night. I was miserable. During that time, I didn't talk to my best friend, as it was hard to be on my phone. At one point she did text me, and if I remember correctly she said, ""What the hell has been up with you,""

I told her pretty much exactly what I said before about having problems with my medication. I think one of my first mistakes was when I told her I hadn't been in the mood to hold conversations. Which is true, I have suddenly found it harder to hold conversations without feeling sick.

Last week I tried to reach out a few times, but I received very dry responses or left on open. And the only times she reached out to me was to read over a document she wanted me to edit.

Two days ago she texted me first asking if I had found time to read her document, and I had read over her document. I said I did, but I also asked her why she's been very dry with me and leaving me on open.

She told me she was upset that I never came up to visit her. (For context she lives just under three hours away and in a different state. In her defense, she had lived there for a couple of years. I have always had a hard time traveling though, it makes me very sick, and I had thought maybe getting treated would help so I could go up to visit her, but it made everything worse.) And I hadn't talked to her for those few weeks when I was struggling with my medication.

I apologized for both reasons. She said, ""If you were really sorry you would've come up to visit me, but thanks for the sentiment."" Which rubbed me the wrong way but, I understand, so I let it be.

Today she wanted to talk about it again, I didn't think there was much else to discuss. She wanted to know what I would do better, and what I would do to change and fix things. And that she wasn't mad because I didn't come to visit her, she was mad essentially because she doesn't think I care about her as much as she cares about me, that she would drop everything in an instant and drive to me if I had an emergency, but she doesn't think I would do the same for her. But that also really rubbed me the wrong way too, because not once did she reach out to ask me if I was okay, or ask how I was doing.

I have never been lower, mentally and physically I have not been well. And I explained that to her again, how I've been feeling and I'm focusing on trying to feel better. And she simply replied ""Then I guess that's all that needs to be said,""

I asked her why she's upset after I explained what I was feeling

And once again she said, ""Thank you for telling me your side of the story,"" And I let that be.

I'm so confused, because I thought initially I was the asshole, but now I'm wondering if she is?

6 years ago we got new neighbors, first thing they did was introduce themselves and said‚Äù we are neighbors we help you, you help us. That‚Äôs what neighbors do.‚Äù

Us helping them more then them helping us,and I mean this by me taking their kids to the bus stop, picking them up from the bus stop, for about 5 years randomly and when she needed me too. I had no problem doing so.. 

Also my husband went out of his way to mow their lawn sometimes and usually free. He recently fixed their flooring in their living room, using our plywood meant for my hallway. He just was nice enough to help out, she had lost her job and her husband was interning. Then a time where we have let their dogs out and no issues doing so, I‚Äôve watched her kiddo when she needed a minute to go to town, my husband fixed their vehicle when they needed a hand on some things. 

anyways  just recently my car broke down. 

No vehicles to get around we live 30 mins from town. Each way.

But the started accusing their husband and his family of abusing her, when they asked how it was because they were not taking care of them and believing all their symptoms. They ended up throwing fits and going to multiple neighbors with the accusation. The police came out multiple times but found those comments to not be abuse. They ended up moving out to a family member near by.  The family members they live with are now considering kicking them out as they refuse to clean up after them self or get a job. They recently fractured a bone in an extremity and after calling emergency services multiple times and going to the ER multiple times are getting surgery on it.

I know BPD is a debilitating illness, but at some point, I have to wonder how much is her illness, and how much is her just being an asshole.

This all started when her rent was being raised. She came to my parents, complaining on how she can't afford her current rental and how she was going to be homeless. She recently had a incident at work, and was traumatized by the events (traffic controller), and refused to go back to work. Fortunately, she has now, but that's another story.

Mum and dad went to Centrelink to try and get her on DSP, only to be told that she has taken them off as nominees. They go to housing, but because she's a legal adult, they won't tell them anything. 

She swears and has been physical with my parents. Mum has trouble sleeping at night because of her.  We go to safe haven, a mental support centre, and she rubbishes them. Mum is usually bursting into tears when she leaves, and I do my best to comfort her.


One day she comes in, and says she's going on a holiday to America. So, she can't afford rent but can go on a holiday that will cost thousands... And then she lets slip that she is going to visit a random she's met online. Red flags galore.

Before I met my current boyfriend, I was in a serious relationship with my ex for five years. We ended things on good terms, but we‚Äôve had no contact since the breakup. During our relationship, My mom fought hard but lost to breast cancer and it was a difficult time for me. My ex had made me a locket with a picture of my mom and me inside. This was an incredible gift I cherished and I wear it everyday.

When I started dating my current boyfriend, I was upfront about my past. I never told him about the necklace thought it wouldn‚Äôt matter. Later on he found out because I went to take a shower and took the necklace off and he saw because it said from my ex to me. He confronted me about it, I told him the necklace had nothing to do with my ex or our past relationship and it was a very sentimental thing to remember my mom. He seemed fine with it at first, but over time, he started making little comments about it. He would ask why I still had it and whether I still had feelings for my ex. I assured him multiple times that the locket meant nothing about my ex and was strictly a gift to remember my mom.

A few weeks ago, I  got out the shower and found the locket was missing. After searching everywhere, I confronted my boyfriend, and he lied about it to me.

She decides randomly to come out anyway and stay with her friend again. My dog passes away on her drive out here. My wife and I are extremely upset and not handling it very well. My mother gives me a little space when that happens until she gets into a fight about 3 days later with her friend and wants to stay with us. I tell her no not possible. So she gets mad at me and hits me with the ""I dont know why I am being treated like this"" basically dropping a guilt trip on me. Eventually she ends up heading home again.

 2 months later my birthday rolls around. My father calls me 3 weeks before asking if its ok if he comes out for my birthday and if he needs to get a hotel and all that. I run it by wife and she says its fine if he wants to stay with us, Hes super chill and quiet. Complete opposite of my mother. Well my mother finds out and hits me with another guilt trip, grilling me about why she wasnt able to stay with us. I understand it is a double standard and I did not handle it very well but I was trying my best. I feel like I was in the wrong here.",0.0,0.03902645409107208,0,1
