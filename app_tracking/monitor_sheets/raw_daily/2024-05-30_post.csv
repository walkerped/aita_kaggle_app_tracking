0,1d481lm,AITA for not knowing the boundaries and requirements of my schoolmates?,"So, a bit of context is going to be necessary here. I am a law student in my second year, and this year, I and three other students participated in a project together. You should know that I am autistic and transgender, and I also have ADHD; therefore, social cues are not precisely my thing. I also had terrible experiences with people regarding the acceptance of me as a person, and consequently, I am pretty paranoid about relationships. This project included some work in the school and a funded simulated court in another country. For most of the project, everything worked relatively smoothly, and there were no significant conflicts between us. 

As we approached the end of the project, I started feeling that I was ""no longer part of the group"", and they did not want me there anymore. But I still got invited to all the group's hangouts, so I said, well, it is probably just paranoia. They also often started group conversations about people not respecting etiquette, but they never explicitly mentioned that I was causing the problems.

However, on the very last day, one of them organised a hangout; not only did they not invite me for it(which is sad, but honestly not that big of an issue), but moreover, they actively tried to conceal the fact that they did so for them not having to explain that to me.

Well, unfortunately, I found out and confronted one of them(this is probably strong basically asked her to tell me next time to save my emotions  ), and she basically said(what I was thinking was happening) that they didn't like me, they were sick of my behaviour that they tried against me, and I did not follow. (At that time, they did not tell me what I had done wrong) When I apologised for putting them in uncomfortable situations and not knowing the facts, they lashed out that I was trying to put the blame on them and I am a child etc, etc. 

They mentioned extensive categories of problems, including, not following etiquette, not respecting personal boundaries, and acting stupid. They noted that they tried to give me cues, but it didn't work, and they did not know how to tell me more, so they just gave up. 

For me, the entire thing has had devastating effects; basically, 2,5 years of therapy and gaining back the trust of other people went to the trashcan.

1,1d47nbz,UPDATE: AITA for threatening to kick out my niece after she hacked my daughter‚Äôs Roblox account?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cv4m1h/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_out_my_niece_after/

Thank you all for your advice! My sister and niece moved out last week, she‚Äôs in the process of getting an apartment and they‚Äôre temporarily staying with a friend of my sister‚Äôs for the time being. I warned her that if I contacted the developers, they would get her daughter banned, so either way my niece wasn‚Äôt keeping the stuff she stole, so she should try minimise her losses. She claimed I had no proof her daughter hacked the account and refused to compromise. She said I was petty and childish for making them ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù over a kid‚Äôs video game. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I feel bad, I really do. My sister and I never really got along as kids so I was hoping at least our kids could have a good relationship with each other. But still, they were inevitably going to leave at some point so I suppose I only sped up the process.

Now that my niece is gone, my daughter seems a lot happier now. She told me she was perfectly fine, but I knew her well enough to know that she wasn‚Äôt. Some very kind and generous people here have offered to gift her some of their items to rebuild her account, to which I am extremely grateful, but my daughter said she felt bad about taking stuff from other people. I‚Äôd already reported my niece‚Äôs account, which seemed to have no effect. I‚Äôm not very tech savvy, but I considered contacting the Roblox developers to see if they could reverse the transaction. However, my daughter informed that doing so would only ban the account, losing all of my daughter‚Äôs items in the process.

I would like to extend all my thanks to the commenter that suggested I try and log in to my niece‚Äôs account. Believe it or not, it only took 5 attempts. Turns out that 10 year olds don‚Äôt have the best comprehension of Internet security. Surprisingly, getting into the account was the easy part. I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time looking up how to trade everything back - I swear I‚Äôm getting old. I couldn‚Äôt tell which items were my daughter‚Äôs and which were actually my niece‚Äôs, so I simply transferred everything my niece had just to be safe.

When she came home from school today, I told my daughter I had a fun surprise for her waiting on Roblox. Words can‚Äôt describe how proud of myself I felt when I saw the joy rush back into her face. The ironic part is that my niece had previously won this very rare halo item from this sort of lottery system, which my daughter claims is one of the most expensive items in that game. Now it was transferred to my daughter‚Äôs account, meaning that my daughter walked out of this situation richer than she was to start with. My sister just messaged me in all caps yelling at me that my niece has been through so much and I was just kicking her when she was down. She accused me of stealing from a little girl. I simply told her that, in her own words, it‚Äôs just a bunch of pixels on a screen.

3,1d3tka4,AITA for telling my mom that she's ruining my wedding,"I'm (28F) dealing with my mom's excessive gift-giving of clothes and her intrusive involvement in my wedding planning. Throughout my life, she's sent me numerous packages of clothes, always unsolicited, and mostly not my style. I've tried to politely return the items I don't like, but this hasn't stopped her from sending more.

My fianc√© recently pointed out how her style is very different from mine, often either very matronly or childish. Despite returning 80% of the clothes she sends, she continues to inundate me with more.

The situation escalated with my wedding dress. When we went shopping, she pushed for a matronly dress that I hated, and dismissed the ones I liked. I eventually chose a dress that everyone, including her, seemed to agree was the most flattering. However, the next day she insisted it was too low cut and even showed photos of me in it to her friends at my grandmother's funeral to get validation. She claimed that they all agreed with her and suggested we go shopping again, which I refused.

Despite my clear refusal, she booked another dress shopping appointment, which was a humiliating experience. She showed zoomed-in photos of my chest to the staff, who graciously assured her that it was not revealing.

However, it didn't stop there. In the car leaving the second dress shop she said she was then taking me to shop for rehearsal dinner dresses. I said as politely as possible that I wouldn't be requiring her services for that, to which she matter of factly stated that she wanted to be involved in picking it out. After I flew back home, she began sending rehearsal dinner dress options to my house, none of which suited me and were all returned. Each dress was either not my style or the wrong size. Despite my polite returns and clear communication, she persisted in sending more.

Recently, I planned a trip back to my parents' place to pick up my wedding dress, which I couldn't bring back earlier due to luggage constraints. A day before my flight, my mom texted me that she had booked an alteration appointment for my dress, claiming it needed to fit perfectly and be less revealing. She also mentioned that she had paid $50 for the appointment. After all our previous conflicts over the dress, I was in disbelief that she had not let it go.

I told her that the prior dress shopping experience had been extremely upsetting for me and that I couldn‚Äôt handle it again. Her response was dismissive, stating that both dress shopping experiences had been traumatizing for her too. At this, I lost it and told her that her constantly bulldozing and manipulating me has ruined my wedding.

I‚Äôve always had a bad relationship with my mother as soon as i realized that she didn‚Äôt care about me. I am currently 18 and going to uni in the spring. 
 She is known by me and any person who meets her as a narcissist and a crazy woman. She has taken my phone, my keys (to the car I bought and she has no financials involved), tv, and even food. We have been constantly fighting for probably 3 or 4 years, I just don‚Äôt like her anymore. And i‚Äôm not just saying that to be a mean teenager.

I ignore all the calls from my mom so I don‚Äôt have to hear the voice that literally makes me feel ill to hear sometimes. I make my own food in my bedroom, that I pay for. She only currently pays for my phone. Not even the bed I sleep on. 
Even though I‚Äôve quite literally never been happier, I feel free. At the same time, I feel like there‚Äôs no going back and since i‚Äôm starting college in August and dorming, I‚Äôll have to find somewhere to stay over the summer, and then therefore never live at home again.

I have also said it multiple times throughout the last year or so of the planning stages to remind her that I didn't have the money. She wants the dress from a specific place in a specific color too. She also wanted me to get my hair dyed for the wedding and paid for that no problem.

Now that we are down to the wire she is pressuring me to buy the dress even though I told her (multiple times) that I couldn't afford it.

Long story short we got in an argument about it and I said that if I was going to be forced to buy it, I was going to quit the bridal party.

8,1d3sos8,AITA for telling my friend not to sell my spouse his boat?,"I (42f) have been with my husband (44m) for 20+ years and have two kids. I casually mentioned to him over the weekend that our friend was getting a new boat and that he wanted to sell it to my husband for 5k. It was casual conversation and did not go any further as far as finances or intentions go. As I was making dinner tonight, I overhear him and our son (19m) discuss the agreed upon purchase and payment plan with our friend that they made. For context, two years ago my husband purchased a 13k atv without discussing it with me first. I thought we worked through that incident and that communication would improve. Also, my son  currently lives with us (barely working) and does not pay any bills. It was after I inquired as to what they were talking about that they revealed the plan to me. The plan was that my husband and son were going to both pitch in and pay our friend ""x"" amount each month for however long. Hearing this, I immediately got angry and basically told them hell no and vocalized how messed it was that a purchase like this was not discussed with me due to the cost and commitment, especially after the last purchase argument, plus also the fact that my son has little ambition to work and pays no bills, but yet wants to buy a boat. I am feeling like my husband and son should of discussed this with me before committing. In a fit of frustration, I texted my friend and asked him not to sell the boat to them. AITA? 

Edit: I did not know the sale price until after they agreed to buy it. I realize by adding the price it as if it were a part of the conversation, it appears to give a different perspective. However, I was only trying to keep the story short and merged details.

Edit 2:  When I mentioned it, it was a blanket statement. In no way, shape, or form did I imply he should buy it. It was sheerly a heads up that my friend would be contacting him.

10,1d3si54,AITA for yelling at my brother that he's fucking stupid,"So for memorial day weekend, I had planned to visit my brothers‚Äô and stay the entire weekend. I checked the bags and the trunk two times over, I‚Äôd thought I packed everything. But apparently something slipped my memory- my toothbrush.

When I was unpacking my bags in the guest room along with my girlfriend, I was going through my bathroom bag. I kept digging and digging and lo and behold, there was no toothbrush.

I called my brother and asked if he had a spare toothbrush. ‚ÄúOf course I do‚Äù.

So he delivered me this really average looking toothbrush, I guess the handle looked a little worn down so idk maybe I should've been a little more perceptive. But yk, my lack of perception is what got me here in the first place.

I brushed my teeth but the toothpaste gave this really pungent aftertaste that seemed quite abnormal.

I hollered at him ‚ÄúDude your toothpaste tastes like shit‚Äù

He started laughing like a fucking cartoon character and it weirded out my girlfriend, (she didn‚Äôt know he was autistic in the moment). So idk I just start like yelling at him cause like wtf kind of response is that.

His smartass starts to explain his little plan-

He started recounting this high school basketball game. It was raining apparently. And apparently I forgot to pick him up. He is 25 years old. This was probably 9 years ago.

He said ‚Äúso yeah that toothbrush I gave you, yeah we use it to clean the toilets.‚Äù

Ok so at this point I just assumed the two were connected and I started ranting at him, telling him that he is stupid for doing this shit. I found it pretty \*shitty\* that he gave me that toothbrush just because of some stuff that I forgot to do 9 years ago.

11,1d3sfk4,AITA for demoting my MOH and barring her boyfriend from the wedding?,"My (25f) fiance and I had our Bachelor/Bachelorette parties the same weekend. We told the wedding party we'd like to finish the parties by having dinner together on Saturday.

Marie(24f MOH) and her boyfriend Rob(28m) are in the wedding. Our group hangs out fairly regularly and anytime Rob was around he would say that the women are ruining the bachelor party because of the dinner. He said that this was my fianc√©'s ""last weekend"" as a single man and that the women shouldn‚Äôt be around. My fiance and I did not confront him about saying these things, which I know we should've done. It really bugged me. My fiance and I had a few conversations about it, but tried to brush it off.

Marie didn't have any plans and one of my other bridesmaids (Liza, 28f) had started planning the party a week prior once she realized Marie hadn't done anything. Liza planned everything. Marie showed up to two of the activities. On Friday, she said she had a bad day at work so she wouldn't be coming. Saturday she said she was sick with a headache. When we met for the group dinner, she told us that she went out to the bars on Friday night and that's why she had the headache and couldn't come to most of the things on Saturday.

 At dinner we were told that we would have to split into 2 tables. I wasn't there, but I've heard from multiple people that Rob said to the group that we should split into ""Dicks and Pussies"". The best man said that he would be sitting next to his girlfriend, Liza. Rob said that that was fine and he could ""sit with the pussies."" The best man told him to go shove it and went inside.

After dinner, I reached out to Marie. I suggested meeting in person to talk, and I asked her to bring Rob. At the restaurant, I expressed my disappointment to Marie for not being there/planning anything. She said she had no excuses and apologized. I decided to make Liza the MOH since she had been supportive and asked Marie to be a bridesmaid instead. 

I told Rob that his ""women ruin everything"" motto throughout the last few weeks had rubbed me the wrong way. He told me that he doesn't change for Marie so why would he change for me. He said that his crude humor is who he is and he's not going to put himself in an environment where he has to walk around on eggshells. He aludded that he would not be coming over anymore because of this ""environment"". I said that if he didn't want to be around me on a normal day, then he was not welcome to our wedding. He said that a wedding was a special day, looked at my fiance and said, ""If you (my fiance) want me there for your big day, I'll be there."". I was furious when he said this and told him that he is absolutely not invited. 

Kicking him out of the wedding party was not my intention going into the conversation. However, after telling him how I felt and that being his reaction... I felt so disrespected.

My girlfriend‚Äôs sister had a dog with her ex, but after they broke up, the sister decided to keep the dog. The ex left for overseas. 

The sister came back to stay with my girlfriend, and persuaded her to take care of the dog together. I protested, as knowing their dynamics, it would be my girlfriend that took care of the dog most of the time (which turned out to be true - family dynamics, shall not comment further)

 Just 2-3 weeks later, the sister went overseas to pursue a job opportunity, leaving the dog in her sole care. The time spent with my girlfriend and I became tied to the taking care of the dog and we were basically talking about the dog and thinking about the welfare of the dog all the time. 

She is not able to send the dog to the sister because the sister‚Äôs prospect in that other country is still uncertain. For context, sending the dog overseas require vaccinations and costs and a month quarantine in that country - something that they deemed inappropriate as the sister may come back anytime (or may stay there for good). This has affected us for 1.5 months now and nothing has changed - it is starting to feel like a situation where my concerns are not respected because I was reasonably bearing with her and not cause trouble.

Last night I decided to press the issue. We got into a huge fight over how her ‚Äúbear with it until sister‚Äôs situation is certain‚Äù is a non-solution as there is no concrete timeline and how she was not giving me any other solution other than to ask me to remain status quo.

14,1d3rwrc,AITA for not staying with my boyfriend on his birthday?,"I(F25) usually stay over at my 
boyfriend's (30M) place twice a week. On Tuesday nights, he comes over to my house for dinner with my family, and then I drive us back to his apartment. I sleep there and leave early the next morning for work.

This past Wednesday was his birthday, and the plan was for me to go to his house Wednesday afternoon so we could then go to his parents' place for a birthday dinner.On Monday night, he mentioned he was super busy preparing for his birthday celebration with friends on Friday but would try to come over for dinner on Tuesday night.I told him it was fine if he couldn't make it since we‚Äôd see each other the next day, but he insisted on coming. I made it clear that if he came,I wouldn‚Äôt be staying over but would stick to our original plan of staying over on WednesdaY.

On Tuesday, we ended up arguing. He couldn't understand why I didn't want to stay two nights in a row, especially since he was making an effort to come over.I explained that staying over twice during the week is quite inconvenient for me: I have to drive us back to his house at night, get limited and restless sleep, wake up extra early to drive home, miss my workout,and feel tired all day. 

For him, staying over means he gets to have sex and cuddle,it doesn't change anything for him. I do all that and he doesn't even walk me to his house gate when I leave; he rolls over to keep on sleeping while I change and get out of his house.

I offered a compromise:I would stay over Tuesday night and only come for dinner on Wednesday. He didn't say anything to that but argued about another point.

When Tuesday night came, 
he arrived at my house for dinner with my dad. When I was ready to leave with him, he reminded me that I was supposed to stay over Wednesday, not Tuesday. I offered to go that night if he preferred, but he got visibly upset, saying he wanted me to stay both nights, and left the decision to me. He added that now we were both upset and wouldn't have a good time together.

I decided to stick to the original plan and stay Wednesday night.He argued that it was logical for me to stay both nights because it was his birthday, and I supposedly loved him. I reminded him I was already planning to stay Wednesday, Friday, and spend Sunday with him for his three birthday celebrations. I felt he was expecting too much and not being understanding.
I reassured him my not staying over didn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt love him and that I was doing as much as I could. He said ""ask any of your friends if it's logical for me to take the train home alone on my birthday eve instead of being with my girlfriend""I feel like a 30-year-old adult doesn't throw a tantrum for not getting his fourth bday celebration. 

We went in circles until we changed the topic. I drove him to the train station, and he took the 20-minute ride home while we texted and I kept reassuring him I loved him, feeling very guilty.

I reassured him my not staying over didn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt love him and that I was doing as much as I could. He said ""ask any of your friends if it's logical for me to take the train home alone on my birthday eve instead of being with my girlfriend""I feel like a 30-year-old adult doesn't throw a tantrum for not getting his fourth bday celebration. 

We went in circles until we changed the topic. I drove him to the train station, and he took the 20-minute ride home while we texted and I kept reassuring him I loved him, feeling very guilty.

The day before the show Mia cancelled, saying that she's too stressed about the exams she had in a couple of months to go with me to see the show. 

I told Mia that I was really hurt, we'd been planning this for almost year and no other friends of mine were available this late notice and she apologised but also told me that the world doesn't revolve around me. I asked Mia to reimburse me for ‚Öì of the ticket (¬£20) since it was now essentially going to waste.

Fast forward to now, I'd barely spoken to Mia over the exam season; partly because I've been busy and partly because I feel incredibly hurt by her actions.

I texted her to ask her what was going on and she had basically said that she's offended I'd asked for money because ""friendships shouldn't be monetary"" and how money is a huge trigger for her. 

(I feel like I should clarify that if I knew she was anything but financially stable I wouldn't have asked for the money. But she and her family are very wealthy so I assumed it was fine.)

16,1d3rpa8,AITA for threatening to move out if I don't have separate wi-fi than my roommate?,"I (22M), have lived with my roommate who we will call Dan (24M) for a while now, the two of us have had no major issues at all and we've been good friends for a while now. Dan generally handles the more social things like talking to the landlord and whatever, and this includes dealing with the internet provider and I give him my half of the money every month to pay for it. 

Now I feel it's pretty important to bring up that ever since we moved in together, Dan and I got along great. He seemed to always like the same things as me, work seamlessly around my plans and even tell when I was upset about things without even talking to me. I genuinely felt like we had an instant connection, i've never had a guy get me as easily as he did.

Things worked fine until Dan got a girlfriend. She's over all the time which I really don't care about, I just stay in my room and give them privacy whenever they want. it doesn't bother me. The issue is that apparently Dan has an app that allows him to control the internet with like parental controls or something and I guess she asked for access to it too. 

I didn't really realise or care until she started bringing up things that I was searching online. She was being very obvious about it too, asking how restaurants are that I looked up, spoiling one episode ahead of shows I was watching, she even bought a dice set I was looking at and gifted it to Dan right in front of me.

When I realised what was happening I brought it up with Dan, trying to communicate like a reasonable adult about how uncomfortable I was, he asked why I had a problem with her doing it and not him.

Turns out Dan has been watching what I'm searching for months, his girlfriend is just less subtle about it, and we are such good friends because he is lying about having the same interests as me. 

I told him that I was in no way okay with it and told him I was getting my own wi-fi, but he insisted it would cause issues with the IP address or something and I needed to stay on his no matter what. So I told him I was going to move out if I couldn't, because I am not okay with this at all. 

For those of you already typing that he can 100% see this. I hope he does. I want him to know this isn't okay, but apparently he would rather stalk my internet history than talk to me and get to know me.

He runs off to his friends house every chance he gets and has no patience when it comes to caring for her. He yells at her for any little thing and complains when he has to spend more than a few hours with her. He's your typical blue collar ignorant guy that thinks his job as a husband and father starts and stops with working 10 hour days to support his family. I was love bombed by him and I'm pretty unhappily married but I'm stuck for the time being.

When we first started dating he did tell me that his ex had a kid that may or may not be his. He dated this chick, they went on a break, then she came back and said she was pregnant but wasn't 100 perfect sure if it was his. He took her back anyway and raised this kid for 2 years then they broke up and he exited the picture when she got serious with her now husband. So he says.

She reached out to him a few weeks ago and said that she's getting divorced and her mom has cancer so she quit her job to care for her mother and now needs help from him financially and physically because said child is now 7 years old and is autistic, non verbal, and not potty trained. 

She sent a picture and this child looks like his twin so yes it's his. I also just learned his name is on the birth certificate so he's for sure on the hook financially. I told him to that he needs to talk with her and figure out child support outside of court so we don't get stuck paying the $800 a month that the state recommends. I also told him to think long and hard about how much responsibility he is going to have as a parent to a special needs child. I told him that I was absolutely not going to be stuck watching our toddler and an autistic 7 year old for him while he runs off to his friends house every weekend.

So my boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) were in line in the grocery store waiting. There was a guy in line in front of us with 4/5 stuff and we were only purchasing one. I asked if it would be okay if we payed first because we only had one thing. I didn't think I was rude about it, I thought I asked politely. The dude was pretty stand offish and told me that he had only few things, and it doesn't make it a difference. His tone was very harsh, and I never want to argue so i said sorry and waited for my turn. My boyfriend immediately left the store and waited for me to finish on the exit. 

After I walked out of the store, my boyfriend was waiting and when I came up to him he immediately told me that I was rude, the reason why that was rude, that the other guy was in the right and that I should have waited for my turn. He didn't use harsh language nor did he call me anything other than rude, but that made my blood boil so much. I told him that I didn't know and didn't think that was that rude, and the guy was necessarily harsh. I kinda brushed him off and said to him that I don't agree. 

Now I see how that is rude, but I still think that I asked it politely. I wasn't being pushy nor demanding, I simply asked if it would be a problem. 

I get that I was rude, but the guy was mean. A simple no would have done a trick. 

It also bothered me that my boyfriend left me alone in that line after that so much. I don't think I would have exploded that much if he stayed there. 

I am very sensitive to criticism and I don't take it well. My boyfriend is prone to them. That is the one trait that I really dislike about him. And the way he does it is by going into details, but still dumbing it down for me like I'm five. It makes me feel like a child being scolded by a father.

I got kind of emotional and raised my voice, saying how I feel this is unfair and that every little mistake I make gets me the silent treatment, which I think is childish. I know raising my voice is never good, but I was just emotional in that moment.

I tried to turn right while still attempting to talk to my wife. At that point she said she just wants to go home and can catch a bus.

I have been employed since I was 15. I pay for everything that she gets for free from my parents. Insurance, schooling, doctor/dental visits, and food for my dog. And I even saved up enough money to get myself my first car, with no help from my parents. 


Ever since getting my car, my parents have been nagging me to ‚Äúshare‚Äù it with my sister.  I‚Äôve told them that if she is going to drive it, she should help me pay for it. 

They were expecting me to share the car with my sister but I feel like I have a right to keep it as my own.  My parents think I am being an asshole for not sharing my car with my sister. Meanwhile, my friends think what I‚Äôm asking for is fair. 

I will admit that I am jealous of the fact that she gets treated so well by my parents. I worked really hard for my car and feel like it‚Äôs not fair that I now have to share this with her.

I would also like to mention that she did get a vehicle from my parents as a graduation gift (which she crashed. hydroplaned), and ended up selling for $4,000. 
What she did with that money is beyond me. That‚Äôs another reason I am super reluctant to ‚Äúshare‚Äù MY vehicle with her.

She has been unemployed for over a year now and keeps saying that she is going to get a ‚Äúsummer job‚Äù.  She hasn‚Äôt even applied to any jobs yet lol. But anyways‚Ä¶. 

My parents pay for all of her bills. Insurance, schooling, dental/doctor visits, and even food and litter for her pets.

I have been employed since I was 15. I pay for everything that she gets for free from my parents. Insurance, schooling, doctor/dental visits, and food for my dog. And I even saved up enough money to get myself my first car, with no help from my parents. 


Ever since getting my car, my parents have been nagging me to ‚Äúshare‚Äù it with my sister.  I‚Äôve told them that if she is going to drive it, she should help me pay for it. 

They were expecting me to share the car with my sister but I feel like I have a right to keep it as my own.  My parents think I am being an asshole for not sharing my car with my sister. Meanwhile, my friends think what I‚Äôm asking for is fair. 

I will admit that I am jealous of the fact that she gets treated so well by my parents. I worked really hard for my car and feel like it‚Äôs not fair that I now have to share this with her. 


AITA????? 



EDIT: Thank you for the many comments. I do plan on moving out and into an apartment with my boyfriend as soon as we have the funds to do so. 
I will be keeping the keys to my vehicle in a safe spot. I doubt my parents/sister would try to steal the keys, but it is always a possibility. 

I would also like to mention that she did get a vehicle from my parents as a graduation gift (which she crashed. hydroplaned), and ended up selling for $4,000. 
What she did with that money is beyond me. That‚Äôs another reason I am super reluctant to ‚Äúshare‚Äù MY vehicle with her.

Let's call him Ben. We were both going through intense breakups at the same time, so we naturally began to confide in each other and became really good friends.

Recently, Ben's humor has been entirely centered around making fun of people‚Äîtypically me. I am consistently the butt of his jokes, even though he knows I am an incredibly sensitive person. When it started, I didn't mind much. We were usually in a group and so we'd all poke fun at each other, but Ben has started making these jokes even when it's just us two. A lot of these ""jokes"" have now turned into just straight-up insulting me. Despite me expressing discomfort with it at times, the jokes continue. Additionally, he's started adding in passive aggressive little jabs about how slow I am at healing from my breakup (I still need to confide in him sometimes). He has told me multiple times that his growth and healing process is more ""mature"" than mine, even though we went through the same thing and it's not a competition?

A few nights ago, we were playing video games together and it was just the two of us left in VC. We were just chilling and everything was fine until I made some dumbass joke that made Ben laugh a lot. He asked me if I came up with it, but then goes, ""of course you didn't come up with that, you're not that creative."" I was shocked by him saying that because that was the first time he didn't use a joke format as a way to hide some negative jab.

27,1d4gwrm,AITA for not feeding my roommate's cat?,"(Throwaway as friends know my account)

I (22NB) live in an apartment with a few other people. I should note that I ""L"" have a cat while my roommate (21F) ""S"" also has a cat. Our respective cats stay in our bedrooms as they don't really get along. So I don't really know what's going on with her cat most of the time.

Last Saturday, I was cooking in the kitchen, around 5pm, when ""S"" suddenly burst out of her room. She was clearly in a hurry and appeared to be going out for the evening. As she was leaving (literally as she was halfway out the door), ""S"" shouted and asked if I could feed her cat that evening. I said I could, and asked her to text me instructions. ""S"" said she would and left.

I reached out to her around 8pm as I hadn't received any instructions since she'd left. She finally replied around 9pm so I fed her cat. I thought that was the end of it.

I realized that ""S"" wasn't back when I was getting ready for bed at ~11pm. This isn't uncommon; there's been many I time I've heard the front door slam open at like 2am. I assumed she was probably just going to be back late again and went to sleep.

I slept in as Sunday is the one day I don't work, and only really left my room at 10am. Around 10:30, when I was eating some breakfast, ""S"" came home. It was clear she hadn't returned until now. She immediately disappeared into her room only to come stomping back out. She came directly to me and yelled, asking why I hadn't fed her cat.

I told her I had, around 9pm when she had texted me the instructions. She said, ""No, why didn't you feed them this morning?""

I was confused and double checked my phone to see if ""S"" had requested me to also feed him in the morning. There wasn't anything so I told her I wasn't aware I was supposed to. ""S"" yelled that it was obviously implied, since she was dressed up to go out and that she wouldn't be back to feed him in the morning. 

She just kept yelling about how he had broken into the food bin and gotten it everywhere, and that she was going to be late for work. And she insisted I clean it up since it was ""my fault"". 

I told her no and that it wasn't my responsibility. She retaliated that I'd set a ""precedent"" since I'd fed her cat both at night and the morning in the past. So the mess that morning was my fault. I didn't think it was necessary since she hadn't told me, but she still insists I'm to blame for the mess and that I should pay to replace the bag of food. Our other roommates are avoiding the argument and I honestly don't know what to think anymore.

28,1d4gsna,AITA for trying to tell my wife not to go to Disneyland with family friends because of finances,"I (28M) have been married to my wife (30F) for 3 years, Known each other for 5. No kids yet. We went to Disneyland about 2 years ago for an anniversary trip and had a great time (I would say a near-perfect trip). She has been wanting to go back since and asks frequently (almost monthly). I think Disney is fun every couple of years and that we should wait until we have kids so they can experience it, and it's expensive for us to go. The trip was somewhere north of $2000 (we spent a lot) and it drained my savings account to do it (I was a Jr in college at the time). **Finances now are fine**, I bring in about $4000 a month and my wife brings in a similar amount. We save about 1k-2k a month just in extra income.

We were visiting a family friend and they (mom (friend), dad, 10M, and 2F) were going in August and invited my wife to come with them. She got excited and begged me to let her go. I wasn't invited but I'm ok because I don't want to take off more time from work.

We are trying to save for a large down payment for a house and for future children (something she wants to do very soon). We have already taken trips to some national parks this year. We are camping in Yellowstone in the summer and we are planning on another park trip for Labor Day. (the point is we have gone on multiple trips already and have 2 other trips planned already). This Disney trip is right after the Yellowstone trip (we get home and then get on a plane a few hours later). I said my biggest concerns were 1. Cost (Disney is expensive, she is prone to impulse buying stuff (like souvenirs, she spent close to $300 on stuff from the last trip), and we have talked multiple times about trying to save for a home),  and 2. she would be exhausted from camping the last few days.

Her logic is that because she will be making extra money from doing summer school (first grade), several airline miles, and that she is staying with the family (not paying for the room), she will just use that money and break even.  it could theoretically mean around $800-$1000 so it's feasible, but its future money.

She kept pushing and I reluctantly said yes. On the condition that she gets refundable tickets in case she or the family can't do it and that she promised me that she would be frugal and try to stick to that summer school budget.

I just want to know if I overstepped somewhere or if I need to talk to her again. Typing this out I am concerned about if I am TA for trying to stop my wife from going and that I am being hypocritical or something similar, but I feel my concerns are valid and she is acting on impulse. I don't think she is TA for wanting to go or her plan but I might be biased.

Edit: I have removed the phrase ""Girl Math"" as I have learned that it is considered incredibly offensive/sexist as a joke, something I wasn't aware of. I will apologize for my ignorance and for the use of that phrase. Some of you are ruling purely based on that. I will evaluate my sexism, and apologize to my wife if necessary.

29,1d4gqm8,AITA for telling my mom I don‚Äôt want to care for her kids ,"AITA for not wanting to care for my siblings

I (20f) have a sister (16f) and two half siblings from our mom‚Äôs new marriage (3m) and an infant sister. My mom insists on my help with the youngest siblings, constantly, without notice. She wants me to babysit, or feed them, or give them baths. Most of the time it‚Äôs fine, but sometimes it‚Äôs overboard. For context in my reactions: I have autism, high functioning/ Asperger‚Äôs.

The situation: Today she asked me to give them baths, I did. It was hard because of my sensory issues and the fact they were both screaming bloody murder in my ear over wanting my mom to give them baths instead. It was okay though, I pushed through, got them dressed through the screaming. Then I left them in the living room with her and started to go back to my room. She asked if I could hold the baby a little longer. I did, but she was screaming and crying still, so it was hard. The only time she‚Äôd calm down was if my mom held her, and she didn‚Äôt want to because she was getting ready to leave for an AA meeting. At this point I was extremely overstimulated. I was standing sort of rigid, but still holding the baby acceptably, I thought.

I (20f) have a sister (16f) and two half siblings from our mom‚Äôs new marriage (3m) and an infant sister. My mom insists on my help with the youngest siblings, constantly, without notice. She wants me to babysit, or feed them, or give them baths. Most of the time it‚Äôs fine, but sometimes it‚Äôs overboard. For context in my reactions: I have autism, high functioning/ Asperger‚Äôs.

The situation: Today she asked me to give them baths, I did. It was hard because of my sensory issues and the fact they were both screaming bloody murder in my ear over wanting my mom to give them baths instead. It was okay though, I pushed through, got them dressed through the screaming. Then I left them in the living room with her and started to go back to my room. She asked if I could hold the baby a little longer. I did, but she was screaming and crying still, so it was hard. The only time she‚Äôd calm down was if my mom held her, and she didn‚Äôt want to because she was getting ready to leave for an AA meeting. At this point I was extremely overstimulated. I was standing sort of rigid, but still holding the baby acceptably, I thought. She began to yell at me, saying I wasn‚Äôt holding her with the right body language, and if I held her ‚Äúlike I cared about her‚Äù she wouldn‚Äôt cry. I told her she‚Äôs probably crying because she wants to be held by her mom, separation anxiety, because no matter how much I coddled her before, she still cried.

30,1d4gl9j,AITA Haven‚Äôt Talked to Bestie in 2 Weeks,"On my birthday, my best friend called, texted, then called again over the span of a few hours. I called her right back after missing the second call and she told me she was ""getting salty"" with my delayed answer to her trying to wish me happy birthday. I said I'm working from home, dealing with a sick baby, have my mom in town visiting, and am making my own homemade birthday cake (nothing out of a box). I'm sure I sounded annoyed and exasperated while saying this, but that's literally all that was said. She replied that she was just joking and started laying into me about how sick she is of me treating her like shit when I'm having a bad day or struggling with something. I tried to explain that I'm just telling her why I haven't been able to talk until now, but she kept talking through me about my shitty tone and me always taking things out on her. I had a baby crying in the background and a cake to get out of the oven, and I just said ok I gotta go, I don't have time for this right now and hung up. She followed with 2 texts accusing me of having a shitty tone and ""gaslighting"" her. She also said if I'd just texted and told her my baby was sick I could've avoided all this. I didn't want to deal with this on my birthday so I blocked her for the rest of the day. 

With regard to texting her about the sick baby, we had spoken the day before and I told her he was sick then, so I feel like she should've already known... and besides that I was literally just trying to tell her that when we were on the phone. I'm not understanding why saying it with words was being shitty and a text would've been acceptable. 

For a bit more context, anytime I get upset with her or tell her something she doesn't want to hear, and she doesn't want to deal with it, she responds exactly the same way I did - tells me she has to go and abruptly hangs up then blocks me for a few hours to a few days until she gets over it. This is the first time I've ever done it to her. 

For even more context, every year on her birthday she expects everyone to treat her as if she's being sainted. It's a whole big deal. I'm about 99% sure that if I made the exact same ""salty"" comment to her on her birthday, she would be livid, even if I was joking. 

She has kids too so it's not like she doesn't understand the demands of parenthood.

32,1d4gd3v,AITA for Burning My Mom's Chicken?,"not serious at all. I (19F) and my mother (44F) were sitting outside doing ""work"". She works from home so she was on her laptop working and taking phone calls. I was sculpting with some clay i had leftover in my craft box and listening to music. 

At some point she goes inside to puts some chicken on to boil. One big pot with a family amount of chicken and another real small pot with just one unseasoned chicken breast for our dog. (Btw I'm still outside at the time, so i am not aware she had it on the stove yet.)

  
she comes back and we sit for 20-30 mins before i leave to wash the clay off my hands. She asks me to check on the chicken while I'm in there. I go inside and check the chicken and grab a snack because i know what she was planning to make was going to take a while. 

So I'm in the kitchen, watching the pots of chicken boil. Both the pots had good water amounts. The chicken in the smaller pot was sticking out of the water a little but I figured it was because of the size of the chicken breast and pot. I sit down and my snack which took 15mins and then i get up and check the chicken again before coming back outside. It was still fine. (no smoke, water levels are okay.)

  
She is on a call with a coworker when i come back and she gives me the signal to not talk. Around 15 minutes pass and she gets off the phone. She asks me, ""how was the chicken"" and i say ""oh, it was fine when i was in there"". Then i start scrolling on instagram for maybe another 15-20 minutes.

 Suddenly the smoke alarm goes off and the kitchen smoke filled (no fire). We run inside and she puts the small pot in the sink with running water and turns around to yell at me for claiming the chicken was fine when it ""clearly wasn't"". And claims she ""smelled something burning when"" I ""came back outside"" but she ""trusted me to tell her the truth‚Äù. which i doubt.

  
I‚Äôm pretty honest with her, if i noticed anything, i would‚Äôve told her. I disagreed with her and claimed that it WAS fine when i checked it and that a lot of time just passed since. It would've totaled to around 30 minutes atp.

  
We went back and forth. She kept insisting it was my fault. My mom has a ""just sit back and take it whether I'm right or wrong"" mentality when it comes to her discipline/lectures. So I apologized, but didn't really mean it. (btw only the small pot for my dog was burned.)

Now I'm questioning whether i should've.

33,1d4g9e5,AITA for asking my boyfriend to sell his flat and move?,"I (25F) have been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (26M) for almost a year. I live in London, and he lives in Amsterdam. We met when his company asked him to work in London for a few weeks. Despite the long distance, things have been going really well. He visits me every 4-6 weeks as he can work from abroad, we have similar hobbies and always something to talk about. He is funny, kind, down to earth, family-oriented yet ambitious and has his priorities straight. We both clicked well and agreed we can see ourselves getting married and starting a family.

He also has a daughter (F5) from his previous relationship. His ex, let's call her Amy (29F) also lives in Amsterdam. I love kids and grew up with lots of siblings and cousins, so I don't mind his daughter at all. He is also a great and involved father, which I find very attractive - he has his daughter 50% of the time, takes her on holidays and spends quality time with her. He is on good terms with the baby mama Amy and they successfully co-parent like mature adults (which I also find attractive). They broke up because they weren't a good fit in the first place, but then found out Amy was pregnant and she decided to keep the baby. They tried to make it work but ultimately decided it would be the best to split up and co-parent.

The plan is, that I'm going to move to Amsterdam at the end of this year - there are a lot of English-speaking jobs and I won't have issues finding friends as the city is full of expats. I generally don't mind moving as I moved to London a few years ago and definitely don't see myself staying here forever. I would move to his place straight away.

However, here's the catch. I've recently found out (he openly admitted it) that his ex Amy is moving from Utrecht (an hour's drive from Amsterdam) to Amsterdam - to his block of flats. They will live a 2-minute walk from each other. They also work for the same company (different teams, same office building). This does not sit right with me since Amsterdam is a huge city and despite the lack of flats, you can definitely find a flat somewhere else. I've spoken to my boyfriend about it and suggested moving, but he owns his flat and he recently renovated it. I'm not sure how to feel about it - I can't ask Amy to move as we have no relationship, but I also don't want to be bumping into her constantly.

I feel like I'm in the right - I'm already moving countries and leaving my current job and my friends behind. I know Amy will be part of our lives as she's a good mom, but I didn't think it would be this involved. My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and we won't be seeing Amy much.

Aunt Carrie is pretty conservative. Generally I just try not to bring up politics around her, because my family tends to give me grief when I stir things up at family gatherings. However she usually finds an excuse to make some comment or another.
 At my grandmother's funeral, she deadnamed me, and when I corrected her she told me ""You'll always be (deadname) to me.""

However, my grandma died recently, Aunt Carrie's sister. It's been hard on all of us, but even before then there were problems. I am nonbinary and use they/them pronouns. Aunt Carrie is pretty conservative. Generally I just try not to bring up politics around her, because my family tends to give me grief when I stir things up at family gatherings. However she usually finds an excuse to make some comment or another.
 At my grandmother's funeral, she deadnamed me, and when I corrected her she told me ""You'll always be (deadname) to me."" My family and especially my mom have been saying how important it is to gather for a celebration, and I think they mean her birthday party. I've told my mom I don't want to go, and I don't think she'll try to make me, but Aunt Carrie recently messaged me on Facebook (which she rarely does) and mentioned her birthday. I simply wished her a happy early birthday, but I worry she may start something if I don't go. 
I don't want to make things difficult for my family but I don't think I can handle the drama of either her constantly misgendering me or going off on me if I stick up for myself. I just don't have the emotional bandwidth. So WIBTA? ",,0.12009534984827042,0,0
37,1d4ecyv,AITA for complaining about my moms face lift,"My (28f) mom (50f) are no longer speaking over an argument involving her face lift. My mom and I are best friends and as far as family goes, it‚Äôs just us. A few months ago she decided she wanted a face lift. My only request was that she not do it in the summer because she cannot be out in the sun for a minimum of 30 days afterwards. A few weeks go by and she tells me she has some dates and asks which work for me. The dates were June 10th, 14th and 19th. I was annoyed, but was already going to be off work June 11th-20th, so I said the 14th. I followed this up saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you don‚Äôt wait till the winter.‚Äù 

A few days ago, I revisited a convo about her boarding her dog while I care for her. She has a 100lb Rottweiler who is ‚Äúexcitable‚Äù anytime I‚Äôm around. He rarely lays down and just wants to play all day long. He bugs you to throw the ball for him, and if you take it he whines/cry‚Äôs and will try to get it back. He frequently jumps on and off the beds/couches and is a bull in a china cabinet. I also have to walk him. I told her it would be easier for me to have him boarded and for me to bring my dog to her place (my dog quite literally sleeps all day). She said it‚Äôs too difficult to get him to the vet and she didn‚Äôt want to traumatize him and said to board my dog. Fine. During this same conversation I mentioned how her house wasn‚Äôt a friendly environment for me. I said she keeps the ac on at 78 degrees, there‚Äôs no fan or tv in the guest room, no pots/pans to cook, doesn‚Äôt keep food in the house (I‚Äôm currently on a diet) etc. I also said I was annoyed the summer was ruined since she can‚Äôt be outside June/July. 

She then blew up on me and said I was ungrateful, unreliable, selfish, not dependable, ‚Äújust like the family‚Äù, and that I betrayed her. She said she was going to cancel the surgery and lose the 3k deposit she put down because, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve wasted thousands of dollars on you and your brother over the years, what‚Äôs another 3k‚Äù. I told her she was being unreasonable and that she didn‚Äôt need to cancel, I was still going to come take care of her, but she was not making it easy on me. Her response was that she never asks anything of me and that I shouldn‚Äôt have complained about anything. 

We argued some more and then I tried to diffuse the situation saying we only have eachother and can‚Äôt afford to get into spats like this over nothing. I said complaining was unnecessary and I wouldn‚Äôt do it anymore and said ‚Äúlets get the surgery so you can feel like a bad b*tch‚Äù. Her response was essentially a F*** Y**. Her stance is that I only have to care for her for a couple days (I was planning on being there the 14th-20th) and that since she never asks anything of me (which she does, just not often) and knew it was important to her, I should have kept my mouth shut.

My (22F) bf (26M) has ADHD and he‚Äôs been on different meds for it since childhood . He always loses his stuff, forgets appointments, fidgety all the time, sometimes he literally forgets to eat.

Two days ago we had a fight over this, i reacted way to much and apologized, we made up. This morning i brought up the topic nicely as possible and suggested maybe he should try different methods, he got upset and offended saying we already talked this. Which is true, previously I brought this up once more and he shut me down saying I‚Äôm not his doctor. 

But this time I have done lot of search about it , and CBT and meditation seems to do wonders. I told him it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give a chance. He got more upset and asked me do I think he‚Äôs stupid and didn‚Äôt already tried those. Honestly I don‚Äôt believe he did but of course I didn‚Äôt say that . I tried to be encouraging about it but no matter what I said (maybe this time they will work, just give it a go, i believe you can do this etc) I couldn‚Äôt convince him.

I've recently realized how bad my so called ""friends"" are. 
So it has been alot through and through out time, but just this week, on Tuesday we had p.e. at the lake, and we had to walk there by yourself. So I was gonna walk with two friends I thought I had a good enough connection with, but y'know they got bikes there I don't it's roughly 3 km to the lake place, and I ask them nicely, to not bike that fast or walk so they can keep me company. Well what do they booth do? They just started to bike all they can. So I had to walk alone there. 
On Wednesday we had technicals, and we who were done with the final assignment go to go home if we wanted. But I stayed 30 minutes, with one of the friends that biked away, helped him with the assignment and took away time that I could've walked home on. 
the day (Tuesday) we have p.e. at the lake again, and I ask extra nice this time could you please slow down so I can have company there. I talked to them on Tuesday how I felt a bit left out when they raced away. So I thought they would understand now, but no he even said this time, ""yeah, I'll go slow so you can keep up"" but what happens less then a minute after?

Her argument is that it is not that harmful to do it when a baby is pregnant and by her words ""the baby isn't gonna come out with a foot on its head"" her parents smoke aswell and it is not that I don't want them to be around the child I just don't want them to smoke around the child.

In my country, the schools are in some kind of competition. The competition is ""which school has the best students"" based on the number of kids who get accepted to uni and which uni they get accepted into. I don't know what perks they get for having a better school but for some reason it matters a lot to the teachers and especially the headmaster.

My school sucks. Worst teacher in the world. Because of this most of the student have a very low chance of getting accepted in uni. We have to take a test each year, comparing the students from around the country and they do REALLY BAD. 

Well except for me. I'm always in the top 100 which is a big deal because it means I'm almost certainly getting accepted in a top uni.

Because of this I get a lot of perks at school because the teachers like me. I get to skip the classes that I find useless and I get to eat and play with my phone during the class if the subject is too easy for me and I get to leave the class without permission to go to the restroom etc. The teachers themselves told me I'm allowed to do these. Sometimes they are even like ""You look tired. It's ok to leave if it's too easy for you"" because honestly the rest of the kids are dumb and the teachers have to explain something simple like 1000 times.

The only person who has a problem with this is the headmaster. A few weeks ago I decided to skip one of the classes (I had the teacher's permission).

Apparently a bunch of kids decided because I get to do this they should be able to do this too and well, let's just say they got into so much trouble. The headmaster called me to his room and said that I can't keep acting like I'm better than everyone else because it's causing trouble.

I said well what are you gonna do about it? I mean c'mon we all know he can't  expel me so I just sat there and told him to go ahead and expel me. He looked at me angrily and called me an arrogant brat but he still hasn't done shit about it üòÇüòÇ

Some relevant notes: the complex we chose offers individual leases for the four bedroom apartment. There's really no penalty on any of the other roommates if one drops the ball in one way or another. The only caveat is that the complex does roommate matching, so if there is an empty spot in your apartment, the leasing office will fill it with someone random without giving you much notice or any choice in the matter. The complex is not exclusive to students. 

There were four of us in total. The other two were close friends with Kate but I didn't know her well, though I was still fine with the prospect of living with her. At first unbeknownst to me, Kate was having some pretty intense emotional issues regarding the school we went to. She was constantly talking about how she didn't consider our college the right spot for her and was thinking of dropping out. She was split on whether she wanted to attend our school further or move home. She was constantly an emotionally broken down mess and was all over the place about what her next steps would be. I was not aware of the severity of her situation when we started the apartment search. I was concerned with signing quickly, as it would secure a lower rate on our rent. Regardless, she wanted us to wait for her to make a decision.

My roommate from the dorms, KC, was looking for a place to live and so I talked with her about the possibility of being our fourth if things fell through with Kate. I gathered the other two roommates and told them I didn't want to sign with Kate and that I had someone else who was ready and willing to move forward with us. Both of them knew and liked KC so I thought the situation was ideal. I felt caught between a rock and a hard place. I also felt really bad about it but still stuck by my decision. 

The other two were hesitant about this decision and wary of pulling the trigger, though they were nervous about the situation as well. I was adamant that it was a bad idea and unwilling to move forward with her. It was a trump card that sorta gave the other two no choice but to go with it. We broke the news to Kate and she was really upset. I found out later that my other two roommates were kind of pissed off at me for putting my foot down on the matter. Kate withdrew from school and moved home, but always blamed me for that- essentially saying that she had nowhere to live and therefore had no choice but to leave.

My sister's fianc√©e is always picking fights with me, and has even gone so far as to throw jabs at my gf who wasn't even involved. She's been accusatory of our finances, stalked my location on Snapchat, and never apologizes after fights. For context, she usually only comes at me when my sister and I get into fights, but those should be between my sister and I, not me and her fianc√©e.

I had already been incredibly agitated and not particularly thrilled to go to this wedding, but over the last few days, she has really gotten under my skin. First of all, she said my gf could only go to the wedding if she apologized for a prior argument. My gf didn't text her that same day so she assumed that it was too much of a hassle, claiming if it was that hard to apologize then maybe she shouldn't come. My gf has a busy life and a lot of her own problems she's been dealing with, so my sister's fianc√©e jumping to that conclusion really upset both of us.  

Second of all, I got a message from my sister and her fianc√©e this morning saying that a wedding gift is mandatory, and that they don't care how shitty it sounds. I wouldn't have had a problem bringing one, but the fact that they felt the need to say it multiple times as if I wasn't going to. It makes me feel like they only want me there for a gift. My gf and I just got done relocating, so we are incredibly low on funds and won't have much extra money after payday, let alone enough for this wedding. This is why I am annoyed that they dropped the wedding date last minute. If I had time to prepare, it would be fine, but I don't have the money for a plane ticket, suit, and whatever sort of expensive gift they're expecting. 

Lastly, they planned on renting out an Airbnb for after the wedding for some of their closer friends and family. They had also felt the need to say that there was no sex allowed. I had made a joke a few days prior that if we all stayed in the same house and I could hear them, I would fire back with retaliation. I was joking, but they took it seriously and made that comment.

My (20M) sister (18F) recently got engaged to her fianc√©e (18F). I support my sister, but I've always been a bit apprehensive of their relationship. They've been friends for 6 years, but only started dating about 9 months ago. So I was surprised when they announced the wedding for mid June.

I have never gotten along with her fianc√©e because of the way she treats my sister, often gaslighting and belittling her. It's my sister's choice to be with her and I'll be here for her if the relationship doesn't work out, but she needs to learn for herself if it's not healthy.

54,1d4aiab,AITA for not letting my 16y/o son get a tattoo?,"I have 4 kids (20M, 18F, 16M and 16F twins). Me + my wife both have tattoos as do our eldest two, which they got when they turned 18. 

16F got a bad stick and poke tattoo from a friend at a party when she was 13, which she was long ago reprimanded for and the wife and I have agreed with her that if it still hasn't faded anymore when she is 18 we will go halves with her on a coverup because to be honest it is quite a big tattoo in a relatively prominent place and it is shaky and patchy and not that well done and we don't want her to have to walk around with that in adulthood.

Since his sister got the stick and poke, 16M has been desperate for a tattoo and when his two older siblings got tattoos as well (20M now has over 10) that was the cherry on the cake for him. He would always whine about being the only person in the house without tattoos. To the point where he threatened to have one of his friends do a stick and poke on him. We explained to him about the infection risk and he hasn't done it but he still complains.

We live in the UK where you have to be 18+ to get a tattoo. I have told him that he is welcome to get whatever tattoos he wants when he is over 18 and I will fully support his decision.

16M is going on a trip to the USA with his friends in the summer. He has informed me that in America you are allowed to get tattoos 12+ (tho I have no idea how enforced that is) with parental permission. He has asked both me and his mother to write him a note stating that we give permission for him to get a tattoo. He says he will pay for the tattoo with his own money and won't get it in a prominent place but we just need to give him permission. I told him no because I don't approve of 16 y/o being able to get tattoos and, had I been allowed tattoos at 16, I would have got things I definitely would regret now. He was very upset and said I favoured his sister (16F) over him because I allowed her to get a tattoo (I did not allow it).

My wife took me aside when the kids had gone to bed and told me she thinks I am in the wrong for not writing our son a note and if I don't she will, though she'd rather I come round to her way of thinking and not be grumpy about it. She says she understands why I am against it but that our son is in the right to be jealous because hes the only one without a tattoo. She says that she thinks I am being a bit of an asshole to our son by unequivocally saying no. She says it is his mistake to make if he gets something regrettable and saying no is going to make him do his own tattoo in a less safe enviroment (which I don't believe because he is a good, responsible kid). Personally I believe the laws are there for a reason but me and my wife are usually on the same page about parenting decisions and she has never called me an asshole or said this firmly that she thinks I am in the wrong before, usually it is a discussion.

We both would love to travel the world together one day and he especially has a fascination with wanting to go to the USA. The difference between use is that I've been to several places already on many different continents and he's only been outside his country once...he got especially jealous when I told him I had been to the USA already.

We talked about travelling together and he stated he wants me to act like I've not been anywhere yet, not giving any tips, not telling him about memories I've made in places, nothing.

The thing is...I would do anything for him but a big part of me wanting to travel with him is that I want to show him what I've done everywhere and do the things I did as a kid but with him. I want to give him travel tips, I want to show him places I've been to as a kid, tell him about the happiest moments I've had all around the world.

He said he doesn't care what I've been up to and me telling him would make him extremely jealous and ruin the experience for him. He even contemplated on leaving me behind and going by himself...I told him if he's serious on that, then I don't want to travel with him. He also said if I ever did mention that I've been to the USA while we're there and ignore his wishes, that I'm toxic.

59,1d49rz0,AITA for going to a birthday party after my dad's wife's funeral?,"My dad's wife died two weeks ago. I (15m) didn't like her and her death didn't really make me grieve. I felt bad for my dad. I feel for my half siblings. But she's not someone I'll personally miss. My dad always knew we'd had a very rocky relationship. He used to ask me to give her a chance because she didn't always say the right things but she was a good person deep down. Her not saying the right things included saying homophobic things when ""she wasn't homophobic"" or saying racist things but of course not being racist, she called my mom a slut because my mom met my stepdad when I was only a newborn. They didn't start dating until I was 4 but the fact she met the guy she would later married made her a slut apparently. Also not marrying my dad for me made her a slut too. She told me she didn't like my relationship with my mom because it left no room for her. She would complain when I wouldn't hug her and would try to accuse my mom of giving me ""issues"" by not taking care of me when I was a baby. It wasn't true. But that was her way of trying to blame my mom for me not being affectionate with her.

She got sick two years ago and my dad begged me to try getting along with her better. I told him the best I could offer was biting my tongue and walking away from her more. Three months ago she was given the all clear or whatever and then she was dead. The cancer had returned and she died before they realize. My dad and half siblings were really upset. I had to be there for them. But I felt like dad expected me to be upset and to grieve like they were. He'd tell me to cry and open up about how much I missed her. He asked me questions when funeral planning came and would dismiss my I don't know what she'd want and tell me of course I knew. But I didn't. I never paid attention to stuff she liked.

The funeral came during my mom's parenting time. One of my best friends birthday party was the same day and I wanted to go so mom said of course and after the funeral (which I went to) I attended the party. My dad was furious when he found out about it, and he found out because social media. He asked me how I could be happy and cheerful and celebrate something when I lost someone we all loved. I had to really really hold back that I didn't love her and I didn't lose anyone, because I really didn't. My dad also raged at my mom. She told him I was a kid and deserved to have a good time. He asked how I could be so heartless and told me I could have stayed with him and my half siblings and helped take care of them instead of going off to celebrate. But instead I went to a party to celebrate on the worst day of our lives.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-30,"AITA for going to a birthday party after my dad's wife's funeral? My dad's wife died two weeks ago. I (15m) didn't like her and her death didn't really make me grieve. I felt bad for my dad. I feel for my half siblings. But she's not someone I'll personally miss. My dad always knew we'd had a very rocky relationship. He used to ask me to give her a chance because she didn't always say the right things but she was a good person deep down. Her not saying the right things included saying homophobic things when ""she wasn't homophobic"" or saying racist things but of course not being racist, she called my mom a slut because my mom met my stepdad when I was only a newborn. They didn't start dating until I was 4 but the fact she met the guy she would later married made her a slut apparently. Also not marrying my dad for me made her a slut too. She told me she didn't like my relationship with my mom because it left no room for her. She would complain when I wouldn't hug her and would try to accuse my mom of giving me ""issues"" by not taking care of me when I was a baby. It wasn't true. But that was her way of trying to blame my mom for me not being affectionate with her.

She got sick two years ago and my dad begged me to try getting along with her better. I told him the best I could offer was biting my tongue and walking away from her more. Three months ago she was given the all clear or whatever and then she was dead. The cancer had returned and she died before they realize. My dad and half siblings were really upset. I had to be there for them. But I felt like dad expected me to be upset and to grieve like they were. He'd tell me to cry and open up about how much I missed her. He asked me questions when funeral planning came and would dismiss my I don't know what she'd want and tell me of course I knew. But I didn't. I never paid attention to stuff she liked.

63,1d495mr,AITA for uninviting my aunt and uncle and suggesting a restraining order against them?,"Names are changed for privacy reasons.
Context: my aunt and uncle (Riley and Dick) have a history of harassment and crazy behavior and are known for airing out drama at family functions.

I am getting married in a couple weeks. I originally did not want Riley and Dick to be there due to past events turning sour because of them. There are also people who would not go if those two went, so I didn‚Äôt want them there. That being said my family convinced me it would be fine.

Last week they asked my grandparents to pay their rent for the month (they wasted their money on drugs), but my grandparents told them no. Riley and Dick started claiming my family has never supported them since the day they got married (not true, my grandparents have paid their rent in the past). They argued with my grandparents for hours, then started arguing with my mom calling her a horrible person and an even worse mom. After this argument R made a nasty post on her Facebook that said some really mean things about me, my grandparents, my mom, and my fianc√©. Basically saying that my fianc√© and I are too spoiled and don‚Äôt deserve any support from our families since they never did.
So that was that! My family (minus my grandma) officially did not want to invite them to my wedding.

I told Dick that what Riley posted wasn‚Äôt cool and that my Fianc√© and I shouldn‚Äôt have been mentioned at all cause we weren‚Äôt a part of the original argument in the first place. Dick tried to gaslight me into believing the post had nothing to do with us, but it was clear enough to make my fianc√© cry and that just isn‚Äôt okay to me. 

We all cut off contact, but Riley started using a burner number to text my mom. She started threatening her and saying that she was going to show up to the wedding anyways and throw tomato sauce on my fianc√©s dress. The threats were extreme enough reoccurring enough (literal weeks of harassment) that I suggested my mom get a restraining order and she is now considering it.

My grandmother; however, thinks I am being cruel and unfair. That the only reason they are acting like this is because I uninvited them. She says that she is going to tell them the location of the wedding so that way they can prove that they can be civil. Even though in the past they have proven otherwise, and they have been threatening her too.

64,1d495ee,AITA for telling my stepmother she's embarrassing herself?,"My father and my stepmother have been together for a little over a decade. I'll call her ""Nicki"". She didn't move in with him until years after I had moved out, so I've never been close with her (I don't actually call her ""stepmother"").

To be honest, Nicki annoys me. She is childish and naive in ways that often feel forced. She'll speak in a high-pitched voice and replace random words with the ""baby version"" of them (think ""boo-boo"" and ""wee-wee""). I'm always nice to her, of course, but I don't like being around her for long.

I didn't dislike her at first, but when my kids (6M and 3F) were born, Nicki's antics almost immediately went up to eleven. Whenever she's around them, she acts either younger or the same age as them. I can never tell whether she's trying to get their attention or my father's, but it's gotten to the point that my husband and I try to minimize contact between her and our children.

My daughter's third birthday party took place about a week ago, and both my dad and Nicki came. At one point, I noticed that rather than take a seat at the tables like the other adults, Nicki was walking around talking to the kids. It was odd, but no one seemed bothered, so I didn't do anything about it.

Half an hour later, my 5yo goddaughter came up to me and asked why there was a ""lady talking like a baby."" She told me she was scary, and that she didn't want to play with the other kids while she was around. 

I went up to Nicki and suggested that she sit down. I explained that the kids wanted to play by themselves, and that having an adult around like that would bother them. She seemed fine with it.

Some time later, my daughter ran to me crying. She said Nicki wasn't letting her play with her friends. At that, my husband and I pulled Nicki aside. From what I gathered, the girls were trying to play princesses and she was trying to dictate who everyone should be. 

We told Nicki, once again, to take a seat and leave the kids alone. She tried to argue with us, saying she was only trying to make sure they were having fun. I replied, ""They aren't. You're not a child, they don't want to play with you. I know you men well, but you're embarrassing yourself, so please sit down and stop bothering them.""

She stood there for a few seconds before she took a seat next to my father. The party continued without issue. I later found out that at least three of the other kids had also complained to their parents, but they didn't tell me (one of them figured Nicki was an entertainer I'd hired).

A couple days later, my father called and told me off for how I'd treated his wife. He says that Nicki is heartbroken, and that I was extremely rude when she just wanted to play with the kids. I reminded him that the children didn't want to be around her, but he's still insisting I apologize.

My husband told me that someone had to do something, as the kids were upset. I feel like this is a dumb issue, but I can't help but feel like I might have acted rudely.

I (16m) was 15 at the time, had recently lost my mom to cervical cancer and had found out that my grandparents and two of my aunts did not want to keep taking care of me. And instead of letting me go to my aunt out of state, they contacted the man who wanted nothing to do with me before and involved a social worker so I would need to go to him instead of the aunt I actually knew and who did want me.

Because a social worker was involved she made the effort to put me with my biological father over my aunt. I pleaded with her to let me live with my aunt and my aunt pleaded for this as well but we were denied. I was told a biological parent will always get custody over an aunt or uncle who has no legal rights to the child. Especially when my original guardians (my grandparents) sent me to my father instead. So in October, 3.5 weeks after I met him for the first time, I moved to another state to live with my father and his family.

For those who will tell me I was lied to or whatever, my father has admitted he knew about me but he was disgusted and embarrassed by his promiscuous ways in the past and for having pre-marital sex and he decided to start over. He said his wife was thankfully ""very open-minded"" and was happy for me to live with them and have a relationship with them despite my origins... which have fuck all to do with me.

My father and his wife are very religious. I'm not. I was raised by an atheist mom, had a mostly atheist family and I have no interest in joining or taking part in anything religious. This is a serious point of contention with my father and his family who try taking me to church and try to set it up so I will join their church and get baptized. I have refused. I have also said I want to live with my aunt. But that gets denied. I do talk to her via dms and video calls but it's not the same. She did try to petition for custody but the different states thing added complications, especially when a social worker is still actively involved.

Things got way more tense recently because two of my father's other kids were questioning me on why I don't pray and stuff like that and I told them I didn't believe, they tried to get me involved with their church stuff and I said no. They got upset and tried to do all this converting stuff and they're only middle schoolers for fuck sake. My father tried telling me I shouldn't shoot it down so quickly and he told me to give it a try and I said no.

I've already told him that I'm not planning on attending, which has caused a lot of conflict in our relationship. I don't want to cut out my family, but it would definitely take a toll on my mental health if I were to go. I'm holding firm, but not feeling great about it. 

TLDR: I'm planning on skipping my cousin's wedding because I'll have to interact with my mom, who I've gone no contact with. ",0.0,0.01436785701662302,0,1
67,1d48w2x,AITA I refused to change airports so my parents can save on parking ,"I finally got around to booking my flights for my family‚Äôs annual-ish trip to Spain the day before yesterday a couple months after they had bought their tickets.

However, I was stonewalled with my mother actually getting livid over the idea going so far as to say I shouldn‚Äôt even bother going. Yesterday prices went down and I got on their flight. The return flight I booked is for a week earlier than them and to Newark which is more convenient as it‚Äôs on this side of the Hudson. 
This morning as I got up to get ready for work they tried to convince me to change my return flight to JFK to grab their car to save them on 180 bucks of parking which would require me making the hellish trip of over an hour through NYC back and then a week later go and pick them up.

72,1d48m9u,AITA I made my boyfriend and his family leave his sister wedding.,"So for information before I start, I have undiagnosed pain in my back and legs that my doctors are looking into currently. 

Me and my boyfriend have been together for around 7 months now and his sister kindly invited me to her wedding, my boyfriend told me he‚Äôd really enjoy having me there so I agreed. The week before my bfs dad broke his foot and couldn‚Äôt drive him and bfs mum to the wedding so my bf agreed to take them. It was agreed we‚Äôd leave the wedding around 9-10pmish. This was perfect for me as I had to be home to pick up my daughter the next morning at around 10am. 

The day comes and I drop off my daughter and get ready, we pick up his parents and go to the wedding. It was lovely, although around 6pm I started getting really bad pain in my legs and back, I just put on my comftable shoes and tried to sit down for everything I could. At around 10pm I mentioned the pain to my bf asking when we‚Äôll be heading off, he asked his mum and she said ‚Äò30 mins more‚Äô, so I thought fine it is her daughters wedding. Half an hour came and went, so I asked again and he said he‚Äôd ask. At this point I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm going to cry so I excuse myself and lay on the sofa in the lobby crying a little. I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene so when anybody asked I just said I was a little tired. 

It was now 11:30pm and my bf come to check on me and said his mum just wanted half an hour more. His mum then appeared and he spoke to her on the other side of the room. She was saying things like ‚Äòoh she‚Äôs having a meltdown now‚Äô. This made me feel horrible to say the least. Then his sister approach us, saying how unfair it was that we were dragging their mum away. At this point I just left, I couldn‚Äôt walk home even if I wasn‚Äôt in pain. I was so embarrassed and angry. My bf says he‚Äôll drop me home then come back for everyone else, he goes to tell them and 10 mins later he comes back and says that they‚Äôre all coming now. I later found out that his dad had wanted to leave for ages as he was in pain too. It took my bf shouting at his mum to get her to leave.

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since the wedding and for 3 days I was unable to stand, my bf had to carry me from my bed to the sofa in my daughters room and even lift my daughter onto my lap to read her books at bedtime and I was in bad pain for another week after. My bf went to his mum a couple days ago and tried to explain just how bad I was feeling but she wasn‚Äôt listening and said that I shouldn‚Äôt come over for a while but my bf stood up for me and said it wasn‚Äôt my fault. 

Basically am I an asshole for an undiagnosed disability 

Edit- my bf was staying at mine so I couldn‚Äôt leave without him as he doesn‚Äôt have keys to my house because he doesn‚Äôt stay at mine when my daughter is there, he was only there when she was this time as I couldn‚Äôt move and no one else was able to help me. I couldn‚Äôt just stay up to let him in as I needed to be up the next morning to get my daughter and I had said 10am was fine as I thought we‚Äôd be leaving at 10pm because his mum didn‚Äôt want to push bfs dad as he had a bad foot. His mum refused to taxi as she insisted that my bf had agreed to take her home.   I also couldn‚Äôt taxi as my phone had died and I didn‚Äôt have the money too. 

My bf wanted to leave at 9-10ish too as he had work the next day, his work clothes were at mine. The drive there and back is like 40 mins each way so he didn‚Äôt want to leave and the have his mum complaining about having to wait to go home. It‚Äôs also a lot of petrol just to please everyone. 

Also when I say ‚ÄòThen his sister approach us, saying how unfair it was that we were dragging their mum away.‚Äô That‚Äôs not the bride it‚Äôs another sister. After the wedding my bf spoke to the bride and she was a little annoyed that their mum didn‚Äôt just find another way home. 

It was agreed that we‚Äôd leave by 9-10ish in the conversation where they asked to get a ride as they knew both me and bf had things to be up for.

73,1d48l9t,AITA (28M) for getting frustrated with my partner (25F) over the lack of understanding during our recent move. ,"AITA (28M) for getting frustrated with my partner (25F) over the lack of understanding during our recent move. 

TLDR: I did most of the heavy lifting, more of our packing and most of weeding, and in return have been getting a bad attitude and insulted by my partner. 

Some important background notes. My girlfriend is highly asthmatic and allergic to a lot, and especially plants. We also have an almost two year old that alternates between being an angel and a terrible twos toddler. Also, in terms of overall things my partner has quite a lot. Our child and I have about the same if not less than her combined. 

The three of us and our two roommates just moved from a 3300 sqrt ft house to a 2400 sqrt ft due to some issues with maintenance and the owner being pretty horrible. A week and a half before our move her and I took up ‚Äúrooms‚Äù to start packing. She agreed to do the closet in our bedroom because it was stressing me out how much was in it and it was the majority her things. I took up our board game closet, which was roughly the same as our upstairs closet space wise, if not just a bit smaller. I figured she would be able to do the closet fairly easily since a decent amount was in boxes already and we typically put clothes in bags and carry them that way. I also had made space in our room to start putting boxes and moving things out of the closet to make them easier to get. 

Within a few days I packed the closet with board games and art things and moved onto the kitchen and living room area which I did most of before receiving help. My partner told me she was mostly done in the closet and had packed the bathroom (a few boxes of things from the cabinets). 

Day of the move comes around, and she and I drop the kiddo off with family and immediately go to get the truck and get to it. Once, we are back she goes up to the kiddos room to start getting it ready for the truck. We waited as long as possible for the little ones room since we didn‚Äôt want her stressed over the move and because a lot of what she has is already boxed and just needed to be taped closed for the most part. While she packed up there I started helping move my roommates boxes and large sectional couch since he was ready to go. We also started taking as many boxes as possible to get things going. After our first trip to the house, I  went downstairs immediately to get both of our desks taken down and into my car to protect each of the monitors, towers and to make sure the cords were separate and less likely to go missing in the chaos. At this point we are all trying to get the large stuff (tables, desks, dressers, beds, etc) all packed up to get those out of the way and squeezing in boxes as we can. This was a bit more difficult as our fourth roommate really hadn‚Äôt started packing his own things until the day of. 

Fast forward most of the day, she hasn‚Äôt done too much lifting or up and down stairs because of her asthma (understandably). We finally got what we needed to get the kiddos room ready for her to come home to after a slight hiccup in that process. She goes and gets the little one who understandably doesn‚Äôt have the easiest bed time. It‚Äôs a new house and she had a long day at grandma‚Äôs so she‚Äôs over tired and probably a bit on edge. It did take my partner a bit to get her down but eventually she did go down while I was still out packing, and dealing with an escaped dog we found. Eventually around 2:30 am I get to go to bed. 

Next day I wake up around 8-9 for us to finish up the house. At this point most of our help is gone and the kiddo will have to be with us. It‚Äôs essentially my partner, her brother and me. For the first few hours she kind of gets a few things ready to go while mainly keeping an eye on the kiddo and keeping her ready, but eventually that swapped up when her brother took over watching the kiddo. By around 1 she left after doing some minimal last minute packing, which meant most our stuff was left to me to pack on the truck. Her brother and someone he called into help got what was in the garage handled and helped me with some large things in the house, but for the most part it was me going up and down the stairs to unpack the incredibly full closet that was never emptied. We fill the truck by around 5:30, including the cabin where I‚Äôve put many of the things either my partner or daughter will need asap, which gives me time to get home, leave the truck, maybe shower and then head to my weekly d&d. I really needed the mental, and especially physical, break so I was excited to do that. Im not sure what I expected when I got home but it wasn‚Äôt to a short temper. I didn‚Äôt even fully get everything in the door for her and the kiddo before getting irritated remarks that I was planning to go, something that had been communicated a few times the day before hand and that morning.  She also yelled that the child had not eaten anything since lunch at the house at 1. I try to typically stay level headed, but between the physical and mental stress of the move and what felt like 0 appreciation I snapped. I told my partner to lose the attitude as I had spent all day moving primarily her things with very little help after they hadn‚Äôt been properly packed/moved in the first place. I yelled at her to be an adult and not blame me for her and the child not eating. She had the car to go the store less than a mile away or call/text me to have food sent to them, an option I‚Äôve expressed on numerous occasions is available always. I also again got a snippy remark that I couldn‚Äôt watch my own child after requesting her to take her back after she got the water from the car and handled a few things. I was in somewhat of a rush as we pushed packing as much as possible before I had to go, so I had really wanted a quick shower to not stink up an entire room full of people. In the end I ordered them both food, was an hour and a half late to my plans and felt overall like crap. After d&d I also came home and unpacked the truck mostly alone so everyone else could rest, and again went to bed at 2:30

Day three, I wake up at 8 to return the truck and uber home so everyone can sleep in. Most of the moving other than a few things here and there is done now. Just handling cleanup at this point. My gf has done very little if any cleaning as of yet. She will be helping with our bathroom and the freezer side of the fridge. Other than that she really hasn‚Äôt had a lot to do. I‚Äôve had to do a lot of the weeding with one of our roommates, while some of his friends helped on the inside of our house. The weeding is the majority of the work though as the tornado from the previous year blew a lot of the green belts grass/weed seeds into it. I was helping with the yard from roughly 5-9:30. When coming home I picked up some requested things, but still got a bit if an irritated reply at helping me bring things in and Im not even sure why. I had put our kiddo to bed by taking a break from weeding to do so and they had also gotten to go to the zoo for the day. Overall it seemed like a decent day for her and our kiddo. 

As of right now I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I would love to switch places in the future and let her do most of the packing, moving and weeding so I can watch the kiddo but because of her medical problems that isn‚Äôt viable. Im considering making sure all of our things are packed separately and I will handle only my things and the child‚Äôs so she can understand why no one, including her family, likes moving her things. Im exhausted and frustrated and feeling emotionally attacked. Normally I can deal with the bad attitude when she is stressed but when it comes to our kid I don‚Äôt like her being used as ammunition against me. I had a horrid father figure growing up and try not be anything like him or my actual dad, so being told I‚Äôm bad at being a dad when my partner is mad really gets to me. She always apologizes and says she isn‚Äôt sure why she said that as it isn‚Äôt true, but she has been doing it quite a bit when angry. Im not sure if she is lying and I am a bad dad or if it‚Äôs because she knows that it hits a nerve. 

Overall I never expected a thank you or any praise, but just some understanding and patience through the move. I‚Äôve instead been met with stress, no patience and irritation at every point. Was I wrong to assume her taking care of the child about as much as she usually does while I‚Äôm at work while I handle most of the physical stuff with our move was fair? Is there something else I should have done? Sorry for the long read, Im just truly at a loss over this. 

Sorry for the long post. I think I got all the important details in, but Im sure I missed something so will try to answer questions. ",TL;DR,2024-05-30,"AITA (28M) for getting frustrated with my partner (25F) over the lack of understanding during our recent move.  AITA (28M) for getting frustrated with my partner (25F) over the lack of understanding during our recent move. 

TLDR: I did most of the heavy lifting, more of our packing and most of weeding, and in return have been getting a bad attitude and insulted by my partner. 

Some important background notes. My girlfriend is highly asthmatic and allergic to a lot, and especially plants. We also have an almost two year old that alternates between being an angel and a terrible twos toddler. Also, in terms of overall things my partner has quite a lot. Our child and I have about the same if not less than her combined. 

The three of us and our two roommates just moved from a 3300 sqrt ft house to a 2400 sqrt ft due to some issues with maintenance and the owner being pretty horrible. A week and a half before our move her and I took up ‚Äúrooms‚Äù to start packing. She agreed to do the closet in our bedroom because it was stressing me out how much was in it and it was the majority her things. I took up our board game closet, which was roughly the same as our upstairs closet space wise, if not just a bit smaller. I figured she would be able to do the closet fairly easily since a decent amount was in boxes already and we typically put clothes in bags and carry them that way. I also had made space in our room to start putting boxes and moving things out of the closet to make them easier to get. 

Within a few days I packed the closet with board games and art things and moved onto the kitchen and living room area which I did most of before receiving help. My partner told me she was mostly done in the closet and had packed the bathroom (a few boxes of things from the cabinets). 

Day of the move comes around, and she and I drop the kiddo off with family and immediately go to get the truck and get to it. Once, we are back she goes up to the kiddos room to start getting it ready for the truck. We waited as long as possible for the little ones room since we didn‚Äôt want her stressed over the move and because a lot of what she has is already boxed and just needed to be taped closed for the most part. While she packed up there I started helping move my roommates boxes and large sectional couch since he was ready to go. We also started taking as many boxes as possible to get things going. After our first trip to the house, I  went downstairs immediately to get both of our desks taken down and into my car to protect each of the monitors, towers and to make sure the cords were separate and less likely to go missing in the chaos. At this point we are all trying to get the large stuff (tables, desks, dressers, beds, etc) all packed up to get those out of the way and squeezing in boxes as we can. This was a bit more difficult as our fourth roommate really hadn‚Äôt started packing his own things until the day of. 

Fast forward most of the day, she hasn‚Äôt done too much lifting or up and down stairs because of her asthma (understandably). We finally got what we needed to get the kiddos room ready for her to come home to after a slight hiccup in that process. She goes and gets the little one who understandably doesn‚Äôt have the easiest bed time. It‚Äôs a new house and she had a long day at grandma‚Äôs so she‚Äôs over tired and probably a bit on edge. It did take my partner a bit to get her down but eventually she did go down while I was still out packing, and dealing with an escaped dog we found. Eventually around 2:30 am I get to go to bed. 

Next day I wake up around 8-9 for us to finish up the house. At this point most of our help is gone and the kiddo will have to be with us. It‚Äôs essentially my partner, her brother and me. For the first few hours she kind of gets a few things ready to go while mainly keeping an eye on the kiddo and keeping her ready, but eventually that swapped up when her brother took over watching the kiddo. By around 1 she left after doing some minimal last minute packing, which meant most our stuff was left to me to pack on the truck. Her brother and someone he called into help got what was in the garage handled and helped me with some large things in the house, but for the most part it was me going up and down the stairs to unpack the incredibly full closet that was never emptied. We fill the truck by around 5:30, including the cabin where I‚Äôve put many of the things either my partner or daughter will need asap, which gives me time to get home, leave the truck, maybe shower and then head to my weekly d&d. I really needed the mental, and especially physical, break so I was excited to do that. Im not sure what I expected when I got home but it wasn‚Äôt to a short temper. I didn‚Äôt even fully get everything in the door for her and the kiddo before getting irritated remarks that I was planning to go, something that had been communicated a few times the day before hand and that morning.  She also yelled that the child had not eaten anything since lunch at the house at 1. I try to typically stay level headed, but between the physical and mental stress of the move and what felt like 0 appreciation I snapped. I told my partner to lose the attitude as I had spent all day moving primarily her things with very little help after they hadn‚Äôt been properly packed/moved in the first place. I yelled at her to be an adult and not blame me for her and the child not eating. She had the car to go the store less than a mile away or call/text me to have food sent to them, an option I‚Äôve expressed on numerous occasions is available always. I also again got a snippy remark that I couldn‚Äôt watch my own child after requesting her to take her back after she got the water from the car and handled a few things. I was in somewhat of a rush as we pushed packing as much as possible before I had to go, so I had really wanted a quick shower to not stink up an entire room full of people. In the end I ordered them both food, was an hour and a half late to my plans and felt overall like crap. After d&d I also came home and unpacked the truck mostly alone so everyone else could rest, and again went to bed at 2:30

Day three, I wake up at 8 to return the truck and uber home so everyone can sleep in. Most of the moving other than a few things here and there is done now. Just handling cleanup at this point. My gf has done very little if any cleaning as of yet. She will be helping with our bathroom and the freezer side of the fridge. Other than that she really hasn‚Äôt had a lot to do.

I might be the asshole because the situation led me to write a few angry text essentially saying that I felt like a fool for believing them when deep down I knew for a fact that this was going to happen.

The friend has some condition (similar to down syndrom, I don't know the actual diagnosis) which makes it pretty difficult for her to find people who actually take the time to have a conversation with her. 

While we were learning together for a (hobby related) test, I spend some time with her, because I didn't see a reason to not talk to her just because it takes longer or can be annoying, because she repeats herself very often. 
I live a good distance away from her, but ever since then we have been chatting and talking over the phone a lot, mostly enganged by her. This has been going on for roughly 2 years now and she calls me her best friend in the world. She gets so excited when we talk or when I visit the place we met. Also she is not completely oblivious to social cues, if I say I don't have time to talk or something she asks me if we are still friends or if I still like her.

The conflict is, I never actually enjoyed spending time with her. I just treat her like I would treat anyone else - with basic decency. 

I don't have the heart to take her best friend away from her, but we have come to a point where she writes me 'good night' every single day and wants to talk every weekend if possible. 
I feel incredibly guilty for telling her she is my friend, when I don't actually mean it and it just feels wrong. I am thinking about explaining her the situation, but I don't think she would understand that I don't hate her or anything. Also I am not sure if she has any other friends, because she never talks about anyone else.

Don't get me wrong, she is nice and can be fun to be around - I just wouldn't call her a friend and therefore it feels dishonest to pretend to her I would.

Edit: 
It didn't take two years, I think on day three she already called me good friend and best friend came when we met the next time. 

Also I never engaged any of our conversation and I go to the place we met for the hobby and my friends there, so thats why I kept seeing her a few times a year.

I don't have the heart to take her best friend away from her, but we have come to a point where she writes me 'good night' every single day and wants to talk every weekend if possible. 
I feel incredibly guilty for telling her she is my friend, when I don't actually mean it and it just feels wrong. I am thinking about explaining her the situation, but I don't think she would understand that I don't hate her or anything. Also I am not sure if she has any other friends, because she never talks about anyone else.

Don't get me wrong, she is nice and can be fun to be around - I just wouldn't call her a friend and therefore it feels dishonest to pretend to her I would.

Edit: 
It didn't take two years, I think on day three she already called me good friend and best friend came when we met the next time. 

Also I never engaged any of our conversation and I go to the place we met for the hobby and my friends there, so thats why I kept seeing her a few times a year.

Not trying to defend anything, just as added information.

Thanks for all the honest opinions so far.",1.0,1.0676401853561401,1,1
81,1d47npe,AITA for refusing to buy my stepson a new iphone?,"So recently I got re-married to a woman who was also entering her second. She was the sweetest girl I knew, super kind, super smart and super pretty. We are so far very happy together. We recently bought a new house, and are living together. I have my daughter (F16), who I am in a very good relationship with and who comes and visits me on the weekends. (I just wanted to add that me and my ex-wife left on good terms, and still remain friends). I also live with my stepson (M15), who I have attempted to get to know, but he rejects every offer.

Last month was my stepsons birthday. Me, my wife, my daughter, his grandparents and a few of his friends came to his birthday party. He was gifted a PS5, and all of us were very happy for him. We had a great dinner, and a good time overall.

Two days ago was my daughters birthday. She had an Iphone 6 for the longest time, and her only wish was a brand new phone (the 15). I was originally going to give her the normal Iphone 15, but due to her good grades and her turning 16 years old (She's so grown up now :( ) I decided to give her the Iphone 15 pro. This was a surprise to her, and I was excited to go to the shop and tell her.

I told my wife that I was going to surprise her with a new phone, and she was really happy for her. However, on the day I was going to give her her new phone (a day after her birthday), my wife had emergency work she had to attend to. I would normally have been annoyed to watch over her stepson, but my wife had always looked after my daughter when I was out, so I was happy to do the same. I told my stepson in the morning that I was going to watch him, and. that we would go out and get my daughters birthday present (my wife was a bit strict when it came to boundaries, and he has a pretty bad smoking record and specifically asked me to take him with us, which again was fine by me because many times my wife has taken my current daughter out for a sort of mother-daughter bonding time). He grunted and just got ready.

We left and reached best buy. My daughter ran to the iphone isle, me and my step-son running behind. She picked out her favourite colour, and I excitedly told her that she would be getting the 15 pro. She was so extremely happy her face was in tears and she gave me a warm embrace. My daughter also shook hands with my step-son (in good intentions). Everything was going well. The best buy employee gave her the box. Just before we were about to make our way to the counter, my stepson snobbishly asks ""where's my phone?"" I reply: ""Sorry buddy, this is my daughters birthday gift. I didn't know you wanted something, but considering you have an Iphone 13 and you got a PS5 last month perhaps we can buy you something sometime later?""

He started throwing a tantrum, calling me a deadbeat and throwing insults at me. I just stood there squeezing my forehead. I get a message from my wife asking how things are going, and I message her telling her the crazy tantrum her bratty son is doing. Two seconds later he gets a call from his mother, and starts shouting. He makes his way out the store - breaking a vase in the opening isle - and leaving. I paid for the phone and the vase, apologising for his behaviour. I got a call from my wife telling me she would be done and returning home.

We reached home, my wife furious at my step-son for acting like a brat. He was sent up to his room. I apologised to my daughter, but she was obviously very happy and wasn't too worried about it. I spent some time with my wife and daughter, before dropping off her to her biological mothers for the week. When I reached home I see my wifes parents sitting on the couch, scolding her for not buying her son a new phone. They throw horrible insults at my wife, calling her a b\*\*\*h and a terrible mother. She was crying uncontrollably. I kick my in laws out the house after arguing, threatening to call the police. I comforted her. My wife has also not been talking to me for two days, staying alone in the room watching TV. She said she needs time alone and wants me to better bond with her son, despite many attempts.

82,1d47icd,AITA for ruining my mom's relationship with her sister ,"I (20f) spent a few of my summers with my mom's half sister(50f) when I was younger while my mom was away for business trips or vacation(my mom's a single mom). She never dropped me off without permission and she always gave my Aunt money to look after me. My aunt always complained that I was too picky because I don't like to eat breakfast (a lot of breakfast foods make me feel queasy) and she would compare me to her kids who never complained about what they ate ( let's be clear, I never complained to her or my mom about not being able to eat breakfast. I would usually watch TV while they ate). My aunt also complained about how opinionated I am but she never told my mom about any of the problems she had with me. 

One summer when I was probably 11 or 12, my mom dropped me off and my aunt abruptly informed me that we would be going to see her cousins who were visiting from abroad. When we got there, I met her cousins' kids who were the same age as me and we hit it off immediately. My aunts kids tried to hang out with us but they were 7 and 6 so you can understand how us 12 year olds didn't want to spend our time talking about 7 year old stuff with them. 

We spent the entire summer going over to see her cousins and their kids. One day, my aunt told me she was going out to the store to get something with her kids and she'd be back by the time i finished watching my movie. At that point they'd been gone for maybe five hours and I couldn't call her because I didn't have a phone with me and even if I did, I didn't know her number. I started to freak out and I went to the bedroom, locked myself in and continued to wait for them. 

My aunt and cousins finally came back around 9pm and she didn't say a word to me, she just went to bed. The next day, she tolds me to get in the car and I inquired about where we were going but she ignored me. We arrived at her cousins' house and immediately I got out of the car, one of the kids ran over to me and said ""it's great to see you're doing better, you almost missed the trip because you were sick"". 

Sick? me? I looked at my aunt and she smiled at me tightly and then I lied about being sick and miraculously getting better the next morning. Apparently her cousins had planned a tour with a shuttle bus and everything and had invited all of us but I had conveniently gotten ""sick"". Unfortunately for my aunt, the shuttle bus cancelled the day before and told them they'd be available the next day. 

I didn't really take this experience to heart. Last year, while reminiscing about my summers at my Aunt's, I told my mom about the whole thing but I was shocked to see that she didn't find my aunt's foiled plan as funny as I did. She called her and yelled at her for abandoning me when she was supposed to be taking care of me. Their relationship hasn't been the same since and my aunt blames me.

83,1d47h36,AITA for not doing chores with how much I work?,"I know most of you are wanting to say that I am the asshole based off the title, but please let me give some context before you judge. 

I am 23M, who lives with my 21F girlfriend. We have our own apartment together with our two cats, and no children. Before moving in, we both agreed she‚Äôd SAH (stay at home), and help with the house while I worked. 

I work 10 hour days 6-7 days a week. I work at a very physical demanding job that often leaves me exhausted and sore. I rarely get days off because I‚Äôm trying to make sure we have enough each week for our bills. I‚Äôm the only one bringing in money, and even pay for her car payment, rent, utilities, my car, groceries, etc. Usually each week is close. And on days I have off, I typically want to spend not doing much of anything. I don‚Äôt usually want to go out, just stay home maybe play video games, the like you know?

Over the past few months (we moved in last November), we‚Äôve had many arguments over me not helping enough with the chores. At one point I agreed to help with what I can, dishes and trash mostly. While it‚Äôs not much, I often forget, and with being so tired, I often just want to come home, eat shower and go to bed. 

This passed weekend I had two days off due to the holiday, and decided I‚Äôd try to help. She went out for a bit and I vacuumed, mopped and cleaned up a bit before she came back. Which she said it looked nice, but nothing other than that. 

Today we had quite a big argument over the same thing again. Saying how she had to leave the house just for me to get anything done, how I don‚Äôt help out, and a bunch of other things. She always says she understands the fact I come home in pain everyday and don‚Äôt want to do anything, but we keep having this same argument. Almost once a month we‚Äôre having some kind of talk about the chores. Personally, I feel it fair that she does the house work, since I work 8-10 hours every single day to make sure we can get by. I see it as basically her job. I‚Äôm not trying to be sexiest or anything about it, but we had agreed to this before we even started looking for places to move into. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm seeing this wrong, or if I‚Äôm in the right here??? I‚Äôm not looking for hate or anything. Just advice on the whole situation because I genuinely don‚Äôt know. 

On top of everything, I have some mental illnesses that can sometimes get in the way of daily activities. If you‚Äôve heard the term ‚Äúspoons,‚Äù I feel like I use all my daily spoons at work. I don‚Äôt want to make that an excuse, but I know there are those people who will understand.

Let me start by saying we have a good marriage and very rarely argue about anything.

First, I needed to make sure the dates were free. She often makes plans with friends weeks in advance and doesn't say much about it until the last minute (I have no problem with this). So that didn't happen, I asked a couple of her long-time friends to help. They agreed and arranged some fake run-of-the-mill activities to fill her calendar.

The dates safe, I made plans for the weekend: great tickets to a show I knew she'd love, high-end hotel, reservations at top-rated restaurants I thought she'd like, a table at a music club, and a few other things to do that she usually enjoys. I also arranged for a pet sitter (someone who we had done the same for us recently).  Basically, took care of all the details. 

We leave on Friday evening, so I told her about it on Monday. I wanted her to have time to process and pack without being stressed. 

She didn't seem excited about it at all. A little later, I sent her the list of restaurant reservations and alternatives to make sure she liked the picks.  Two days later, she hadn't said a word about the trip and hadn't even looked at the restaurant list.

I reminded her this morning that we're supposed to leave tomorrow and we needed to pack tonight. That started the argument. 

She says she feels disrespected because I planned without telling her. She said I embarrassed her by asking her friends to lie to her. She's mad I asked the person to watch our pets and didn't ask her sister to do it first. I told her I did ask and her sister couldn't do it.

She was angry I didn't tell her in advance so she didn't stress. I reminded her I told her a week in advance and arranged everything precisely so she wouldn't stress. 

I told her I had to do this while tickets/reservations were still available and didn't want to tell her about her birthday present a month in advance. Her friends were happy to help and thought she'd like this surprise.

91,1d45jks,AITA for refusing to have any alcohol at my wedding ,"I (28F) and my fiance Mike (28M), are having a destination wedding in another state. One of our mutual friends is the manager of a hotel and agreed that during the off season when the hotel is slowest, we can have our wedding and several rooms at a great rate. It's a beautiful venue with a large hall, wonderful land, a pond, pool and lots of activities. Mike and I come both come from big families that do big weddings, we are expecting around 350 people to attend, possibly even more. 

Mike and I are paying for most of the wedding ourselves with a bit of help from our parents only. We have not asked for any monetary assistance nor are we asking for wedding gifts, if people would like to give us gifts or money that would be highly appreciated but strictly voluntarily. Another of our mutual friends runs a daycare centre and her and her employees have offered to have a babysitting service for younger children so that we can have children at the wedding. All the staff volunteered and we are paying for their rooms, food and activities during the wedding period. For guests who are coming from far and RSVP within good time, their rooms, activities  and babysitting service will be heavily subsidized.

Due to the large number of young children and teenagers that will be in attendance, we have informed our guests that there will be a very strict no alcohol policy for our guests on the premises. If people wish to consume alcohol off the premises we won't stop them but on the premises there will be zero alcohol served to the guests until after the reception is done. Guests will check into the hotel as wedding guests and all will abide by this rule. This is to avoid any form of underage drinking and any drunken shenanigans from adults. If people bring alcohol from outside they can have it, just no drinking during the ceremony or reception.

The babysitting service is for the younger children with light supervision for those below 18 and for those who pay for it. This is the only thing besides people RSVP'ING in time that we have asked for. We have received a lot of push back from guests, mostly family members, complaining about the no alcohol rule. There are even some saying that since there's a babysitting servce then they (the babysitters) will ensure that no kids will drink and that alcohol should be allowed.

I and my fiance think it's a fair thing to ask for given that we aren't demanding money or gifts and have a babysitting service so there can be kids allowed but now we are having doubts about the alcohol and thinking that maybe we can make the wedding child free so that the adults can have alcohol like they want.

Am I the Asshole for refusing to have alcohol at my wedding?

Edit: The hotel agreed so long as the guests agree as well. In the past on my side, there was an incident where before my aunt's wedding, some guests had gotten very intoxicated to the point of alcohol poisoning, they had to be taken to the hospital and it really dampened things. On my fiance's side there are a few ""openly rebellious"" teens who have been found drinking while underage and some rowdy behavior from the adults on both of our sides. It's a strange rule we agree but given the previous circumstances we think it may be warranted.

Also everyone saying. Don't know the stress of the morning shift. I have literally done it for 2 years. She is the one that wanted the morning shift because of her schedule

For everyone saying have you asked what is wrong, yes she doesn't give an answer 


I need an outisde opinion to this.

My wife and I have two kids that are both in daycare. My wife will take the morning shift, which includes getting the kids up, getting breakfast and to the daycare.

I handle the night shift which is getting the kids from daycare, doing dinner and starting to get them ready for bed. Usally she gets home around 6:30-7 and the whole family has like 30 minutes together before the kids bedtime. We usally spend reading to them. She has to travel an hour+ ( depends on traffic)to work each way. 

So the kids are getting at daycare at 8 in the morning and I will pick them up around 4. I work from home and start around 7 and end around 3-3:30.

The issue is around brekafast, we agreed that I would make dinner each night and she does breakfast. She already makes food for the kids so it's literally just making an extra one of what she is already making. 

For the past month she will either not make it at all for me, not tell me that it is done ( I have asked her to just give a general time but she keeps switching up the schedule). One day the are eating a 7 in the morning and then getting dressed other days she is giving them toast before getting into the car.

I have talked to her multiple time and explained that it is not considerate.  We got into an argument and she told me I am home so just make my own food. I explained I may be home but I am doing my job.

Yesterday she didn't make anything and I had enough. She came home and I didn't make her anything for dinner. When asked I told her she is home and can make her own food.


This started a huge argument and she called me a jerk. ",Asshole,2024-05-30,"AITA for refusing to make my wife dinner since she will not make me breakfast Edit- I have the kids more than her, she has them for an hour in the morning and I have them for 2-3 every night. Also everyone saying. Don't know the stress of the morning shift. I have literally done it for 2 years. She is the one that wanted the morning shift because of her schedule

For everyone saying have you asked what is wrong, yes she doesn't give an answer 


I need an outisde opinion to this.

My wife and I have two kids that are both in daycare. My wife will take the morning shift, which includes getting the kids up, getting breakfast and to the daycare.

I handle the night shift which is getting the kids from daycare, doing dinner and starting to get them ready for bed. Usally she gets home around 6:30-7 and the whole family has like 30 minutes together before the kids bedtime. We usally spend reading to them.

98,1d448x8,AITA for blowing up on my roommate for having guests over at 3am? ,"I live in a 4 bedroom 4 bathroom townhome with 3 other girls. We all get along very well, and hang out on occasion with each other. We have one roommate, Tia. Tia usually is never home very often as she takes herself and her dog to her boyfriends and will be there most of the time. He is currently out of town so she has been home which kind of sucks. Sometimes her being home is a massive disturbance. She‚Äôs loud when she walks and talks, she‚Äôs heavy handed so she slams doors, and she kept breaking our AC by leaving our patio door open to let her dog outside to bark at everyone. She also will sometimes use our dishes and not wash them. 

Well, last night she texted me and asked if i‚Äôd be up late to hang out with her, i told her no because i work and had to be up at 5am to start my 4 days in a row shifts of 12 hours and went to bed. I got woken up out of a dead sleep at 2:00am by her dog barking at the top of his lungs and running back and forth, it startled me because everyone was already home and i wasn‚Äôt expecting visitors. I checked my phone and saw she asked our group chat if ‚Äúit was okay to have coworkers over and that she‚Äôll clean up tomorrow‚Äù nobody responded because it was 2:00am but she still had them over anyways. I texted her back in the group chat and told her to just keep it down because i had to be up in 3 hours and I was already woken up. 

No response, and what preceded was her and her coworkers running up and down the stairs yelling and laughing. I texted her again and said hey i get it‚Äôs hard to be quite because my room is the only one downstairs right next to the living room and our apartment is all wood but to please be considerate. No response, I text again about 30 minutes later when the noise didn't die down a little bit more angry telling her to go outside on the patio with her coworkers or just cut it all together because i still couldn't go to sleep and could hear their conversations verbatim. 

after another 15 minutes of that not working and me trying to drown out the noise i flew out of bed angry because now it has been an hour, stomped to the living room to which they all went quite and started profusely apologizing for being loud. I said nothing, grabbed a bottle of water, stormed back to my room and slammed the door. They immediately left and after ranting to my sister about it, i finally went to bed. I feel like slamming my door may have been immature but i was EXHAUSTED watching the clock tick away knowing I have to be up soon. I'm a nurse at a busy hospital so I need my sleep.

A couple of days later, I find out she‚Äôs done ketamine for the first time. I was a bit disappointed in her as she had barely recovered physically from the MDMA.

100,1d43rvw,AITAH for being aggressive and raising my voice when I'm angry?,"I'm frustrated and need to talk. (F25) My mother is my best friend and support system. We've been through tragic events together, and she often leans on me for support. I usually expect her to give me rational advice, but lately, she's been offering impractical suggestions.

Today, we discussed my future plans, which are very stressful, including preparing for a crucial national exam, applying for a competitive internship, and attending a language workshop. Despite my detailed explanation, she suggested I join a theater workshop in July to improve my communication skills. I told her I didn't have time, but she kept pushing, which made me angry. I gradually raised my voice, trying to explain my situation, but she accused me of being disrespectful and lazy.

When I try to speak calmly and rationally, she often doesn't understand me. Bit by bit, I start unconsciously raising my voice to voice my problems. This affects our relationship because she sees it as an act of disrespect.

My mom often doesn't seem to understand me, and I have to repeat myself multiple times. This morning, I explained my busy schedule and asked for her patience, but she didn't listen. Instead, she gave unsolicited advice and triggered my frustration. When I raised my voice, she ignored the main issue and focused on how disrespectful I was being.

I feel like my mom doesn't appreciate my efforts and constantly points out my flaws, which hurts my self-esteem. My dad is supportive and reassures me that I'm doing well, but my mom's actions make me feel disrespected. She misunderstands my need for boundaries as a desire to eliminate her from my life.

I want her to trust and respect me. I have a logical plan and am patiently working towards my goals, despite external pressures. I'm grateful for all my experiences, both good and bad, and I'm trying to enjoy life. 
I just feel that my mother doesn‚Äôt appreciate my efforts. 

So, am I the a-hole for reacting aggressively? Please don't suggest professional help, as I can't afford it, and communication isn't my family's strong suit.


Edit: 

‚Ä¢We discussed my future plans five days ago during dinner.

‚Ä¢I explained everything to her twice over coffee.

‚Ä¢Yesterday, while we were hanging out together in the garden and sipping tea, we discussed the situation further.

‚Ä¢Just before that, we were doing chores outside together, and I explained everything again in detail from A to Z.

‚Ä¢To enhance my communication skills, as a teacher, I received feedback and guidance. I've excelled in my theatre classes without any failures. Additionally, six months ago, when she first suggested it, we discussed this matter. After conducting research, I found a theatre workshop that only accepts applications in October. Despite being behind schedule, I assured her that I would participate this October.

 My grandma‚Äôs birthday lunch in a pub was originally supposed to take place in April; however, it was cancelled two nights before because she had a stomach bug. 

 

I had prepared to go to this, and I had packed all my things to travel and stay with my parents the night before the party.

 

Well, it‚Äôs now been rescheduled for a Sunday next month and I just don‚Äôt feel up for going. I told my mum that I would let her know if I was going last Friday, but I never got back to her. She has just messaged me now to ask me if I have decided.

 

I just haven‚Äôt felt anything like myself recently. I‚Äôm completely stressed and burnt-out because I‚Äôve been unemployed for 10 months after losing my job in July. I‚Äôve got so many worries about money, the future, careers/job, my relationship with my boyfriend, my neighbour (who is incredibly loud and who we can hear from every window in our house at all times of day who plays music or shouts or shouts on speakerphone in our shared garden all day long) , where to live/move to (my boyfriend is desperate to move because of the neighbour but it feels nigh on impossible to make any decision when I have no job/job offers/job prospects). I‚Äôm living off savings too, it feels like absolutely everything is up in the air and it is horrible.

 

I've known all along that I don't want to go or don't feel up for going, I feel completely drained by the idea and I don't want to have to travel on my own again. It just feels like too much for me right now, I'm so sorry.

 

I will need to take 3 trains to get there which will take 2 hours 45 minutes each way and then I will need somebody to pick me up at the train station and drive me to the pub.

 

I don‚Äôt have any excuse for not going because I‚Äôm unemployed and I have no holidays or anything planned to use an excuse.

 

I feel terribly guilty for not going, but I just don't think it's fair to make myself go to something when I just don't feel like myself and haven't for a few months now. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-30,"WIBTA for not attending my grandma's birthday pub lunch/party?

I've known all along that I don't want to go or don't feel up for going, I feel completely drained by the idea and I don't want to have to travel on my own again. It just feels like too much for me right now, I'm so sorry.

 

I will need to take 3 trains to get there which will take 2 hours 45 minutes each way and then I will need somebody to pick me up at the train station and drive me to the pub.

 

I don‚Äôt have any excuse for not going because I‚Äôm unemployed and I have no holidays or anything planned to use an excuse.

 

I feel terribly guilty for not going, but I just don't think it's fair to make myself go to something when I just don't feel like myself and haven't for a few months now. ",0.0,0.06670960038900375,0,1
104,1d4311s,AITAH for telling my dad his girlfriend can‚Äôt come to my reception dinner?,"Hello all, my finance and I decided to elope for our wedding and in the process are getting together some reception dinners in our home country prior to leaving for the Elopment. My parents were divorced around 7-8 years ago and it was a fairly rough breakup (parents don‚Äôt like each other now) my dad two years later started dating someone who is 25 years younger and doesn‚Äôt speak the same language very well. It sent a message to my family that she was in the relationship for wrong reasons (my dad has quite a bit of $) but my dad was fervent on it being true love. In any case we sort of settled between each other on not agreeing as to why his partner is with him and moving on. Since then, we have all been to quite a few dinners having no problems at all. She is nice to me in person and never says anything mean (albeit she doesn‚Äôt say much of anything because she doesn‚Äôt comfortable speak the language) but I still do not feel as though I have a relationship with her in any way. For that reason I told my dad my preference for the dinner was for close family and she wasn‚Äôt invited. He then threatened me that he wouldn‚Äôt come and is now risking our relationship on this.

EDIT: just to clarify, there are 7 people going to the dinner. Two grandparents, and a few of my cousins. This isn‚Äôt a huge event with a lot of people bringing +1s.

Edit: thank you all for the comments. There have been some common themes so I want to clarify a few things:
- when I say she doesn‚Äôt comfortable speak the language I mean she will mispronounce words and not know the engkish words for certain things. This isn‚Äôt a situation where she speaks broken English but instead sometimes needs help.
- I hold no resentment against my mom or dad. Since it is my reception dinner with a very small group of people, I wanted that group of people to be people I grew up with that I was close with. That amounted to around 7-8 people, the only couple being my grandparents.
- My dad is well aware that despite not agreeing with his relationship it‚Äôs not my job nor my position to judge him. Whatever makes him happy is most important to me as long as it doesn‚Äôt impact my life. I am incredibly nice to her and go out of my way whenever we have dinners to make conversation and ask her about things but that sentiment is not returned. Despite English not being her native tongue she can make reasonable attempts (I would think) to ask me things about my life.

Starting last Friday I worked 7 nights in a row with today being my only day off. Well yesterday my mom randomly sprung on me that I have to babysit my little sisters today while she went to work. I complained that I have stuff I wanted to do and that it's my only day off after work so much with multiple rough nights since we're short handed. She responded with: ""You should have known since schools out for the summer."" (Id babysit my little sister's a lot for free before especially when she worked). My dad works at home full-time with a market researching job and my mom works retail at an adult toy toy store on Thursdays only unless she's called in.

I complained about this with my worker last night and they said my mom's taking advantage of me and that she can't just make me babysit especially when I pay rent. I told my worker that I should just do it since I only have 2 chores that I suck at maintaining cause it slips my mind and eventually my mom has to tell at me to do it (It's usually straight to yelling/or attitude).

And I'm just continuing my day acting as if she is not there. I'm trying to take measures for this since the beginning of the relationship, I'm constantly checking my phone to see her messages, try to often inform her where am I and what am I about to do. I made some mistakes at the beginning of the relationship by trying to hide our relationship in our workplace because I was worried that my toxic (and very recent) boundary-invading ex might have done things like create gossip or frame us for evil stuff etc...

And ever since then she constantly feels like this whenever I try to ""establish professionalism"" in workplace. For example, I don't want to hold hands in the workplace. I didn't want to go to cafeteria with her either because that would look like I was abandoning my job for personal affairs. But I understand that this was a mistake and I could take the time to have a chat for some time during the day. I also recently learned that it was OK for me to skip lunch with my team like once a week to eat with her. But she was in constant feeling of neglect until I learned all of these.

110,1d41rnk,AITAH for secretly mocking somebody for not getting into an Ivy League?,"(Posted on a throwaway account for security)

 I, (18M) was on the prom committee with Sampson (18M) who was one of your classic popular boys who got away with anything and would still be praised regardless. 

There was discussion going on in the prom committee group chat about the finances behind the event, and whether we could supply drinks for plus ones as well. I, personally, was against allowing plus ones seeing as we were already tight on our budget, and allowing people who didn‚Äôt even attend our school to come to our prom did not seem worth there being insufficient food and drink to go around. 

The group chat got quite heated, as another girl and I are strongly in favour of staying safely within our budget, but Sampson and two other girls (unsurprisingly his minion female friends who have historically defended him relentlessly) were firmly advocating to allow the plus ones to go ahead. To ensure you understand the situation, this guy is a dick - very rich, entitled and misogynistic. 

As things get heated, he suddenly sends a message saying ""LOOK. It won't even be too expensive!"" and sends an entirely inaccurate estimate of how much the event is going to cost. In a state of irritation at the fact that this is clearly wrongly calculated, and the girls on the chat are eating it up just to meat ride, I type in to my message bar ""Let me ask someone who actually got into Harvard to calculate that"" (He got rejected lol). Now to be clear, I DID NOT SEND THE MESSAGE, it was just a jokey hypothetical of what I could send, so I screenshotted the words still in my typing bar to show to some friends. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I didn‚Äôt even apply to any Ivy leagues so this wasn‚Äôt intended to be pretentious). 

In attempting to post this screenshot of my funny message to my private story with my 5 closest friends, I accidentally posted it to another with around 12 people on it. Most agreed it was classic Sampson being stubborn and laughed at the thought of me actually sending that. Until, one of the girls who has relentlessly stood up for his wrongdoings in the past, sees this on my private story and tells EVERYONE, framing me as cruel and inconsiderate when it was intended to be a harmless joke. 

It shocked me because in the past, boys in that friend group including Sampson himself had said the most vile things of sexist and gross natures, and no one had ever seriously objecte. Yet, i HYPOTHESISE (don't even actually send it) a slightly insensitive message to show to a few close friends who had discussed his arrogance before many times, and suddenly I was some cold-hearted villain? 

I was basically completely socially isolated for what was clearly a joke intended to be maintained among friends. Sampson himself did not even care, so their protection of him seemed to have ulterior motives, aka to meat ride this pathetic excuse of a man. They didn‚Äôt actually care about the morals.

111,1d41ijw,AITA for getting my sister to do my prom makeup two years in a row when she wouldn't do our stepsister's makeup too?,"I (18f) had my sister (22f) do my makeup for prom last year and again this year. My sister is really good at doing makeup and we're close which is why she was cool with doing my makeup both times, and for free lol. But this year was a little more of a big deal and I wanna hear what others say.

So for the last 8 years we've had a stepsister and she's a year younger than me. Our mom married stepsister's dad. My sister is no contact with our mom, and with mom's husband and our stepsister too. We kept in touch but she only talks to me and doesn't have anything to do with our stepsister. But last year my stepsister got really jealous that my sister did my prom makeup and she was upset that she wasn't invited along. She wanted ""sister time"". So this year, because she was also going to prom, she wanted my sister to do her makeup too and we could all hang out while it happened. But my sister didn't want to do it and I still wanted my sister to do it and didn't care that I wouldn't have my stepsister there. She's okay but I don't think of us as close or as sisters.

Because I did go to my sister so she could do my makeup my mom and her husband were pretty pissed off that I went again knowing she excluded our stepsister. Mom told me I could have stayed and my stepsister and I could have done each other's makeup and we could have bonded better. I told mom that wasn't what I wanted and I wanted my sister to do it. It became a fight. My mom's husband asked why he and mom got married if the three of us (me, sister and stepsister) weren't going to have a sisterly relationship. I told him I couldn't answer that because I didn't have any choice.

A week and a half after prom my stepsister came into my room and read this letter she wrote about how badly I hurt her feelings and saying all she wanted was for us to see her as a sister and treat her the same as we treat each other. I know it was meant to make me feel guilty because she kept getting more and more into her wishes and dreams and how she had a rough life before her dad married our mom. But I was in the middle of finishing a final project and it annoyed me that she was in there. And when she didn't get me to feel guilty she called me a whore.

I told my sister what was going on and she ended up telling me to move in with her, which I did, and that's when my mom really went crazy on telling me how awful I was. She asked me if my sister doing my makeup was worth all this and she told me I should be ashamed for the selfish decision I made when I went ahead with it.

So this year, because she was also going to prom, she wanted my sister to do her makeup too and we could all hang out while it happened. But my sister didn't want to do it and I still wanted my sister to do it and didn't care that I wouldn't have my stepsister there. She's okay but I don't think of us as close or as sisters.

Because I did go to my sister so she could do my makeup my mom and her husband were pretty pissed off that I went again knowing she excluded our stepsister. Mom told me I could have stayed and my stepsister and I could have done each other's makeup and we could have bonded better. I told mom that wasn't what I wanted and I wanted my sister to do it. It became a fight. My mom's husband asked why he and mom got married if the three of us (me, sister and stepsister) weren't going to have a sisterly relationship. I told him I couldn't answer that because I didn't have any choice.

A week and a half after prom my stepsister came into my room and read this letter she wrote about how badly I hurt her feelings and saying all she wanted was for us to see her as a sister and treat her the same as we treat each other. I know it was meant to make me feel guilty because she kept getting more and more into her wishes and dreams and how she had a rough life before her dad married our mom. But I was in the middle of finishing a final project and it annoyed me that she was in there. And when she didn't get me to feel guilty she called me a whore.

I told my sister what was going on and she ended up telling me to move in with her, which I did, and that's when my mom really went crazy on telling me how awful I was. She asked me if my sister doing my makeup was worth all this and she told me I should be ashamed for the selfish decision I made when I went ahead with it.

112,1d417fd,AITA for not providing elderly care for my neighbors?,"Kind of an old hat by now, but it still haunts me.

I (39 m) had an elderly couple as neighbors and befriended the wife at some point, sharing some pleasant conversations. Even at the start, she was very afraid about her husband's health and having to move to a nursing home since they struggled with money problems, despite the husband having been a doctor. Apparently, medical bills were piling up and their flat wasn't that cheap either.

  
Anyway, time passes, I move out at some point to another street not far away. Still getting the occasional phone call from the wife to keep me updated. They indeed had moved to a nursing home but later returned to their flat, as the wife apparently wasn't happy with the quality of services provided. So their money problems remain, upped up by the fact that they need a part-time caretaker for washing the husband.

At this point, I start offering helping out on occasion to save them some money. When push comes to shove, I've got a lot of free time on my hand after work, so I thought might as well giving something back. It was mostly heaving the husband in bed at night, changing diapers, nothing I haven't done during community service.

However, helping the couple out turned out increasingly frustrating to me, as the wife would start calling me at work, prompting me to block her on my cell phone and her requests generally started to become more demanding. Like asking me if I could find her some assistance for her paperwork, me asking around aid organizations to call her, only for her to turn them all down and claim that I apparently misunderstood what she wanted. This was pretty much also the way all of my own suggestions were handled that might have improved their situation. 

The worst about it though was the slow financial, physical and mental decay you could witness with both of them over the years and her often shifting between being pitiful and being spiteful. Other than a friend of theirs (already pushing 80 at the time), who bought groceries for them and their ever changing caretaker, I was apparently one of their very few acquaintances left when I finally decided to cut ties.

So one night after helping bringing her husband to bed I told her pretty much flat out that I wouldn't provide artificial life support for a lifestyle that apparently wasn't working in my eyes. And that was pretty much that.

She hasn't called me since, other than on accident. Her husband passed away last year and I see her occasionally shuffling around with their friend but we usually only exchange some brief pleasantries.

A few years ago, my FIL cheated on my MIL and left their family to live a few hours away. He lives in a small bedsit on the opposite side of the country. We barely saw him and when he'd come down to visit, he'd not even bother letting my partner know he was in town, and just see the other kids.
 
My FIL is super self centred, and believes he is right about everything. I rarely bother challenging him as I don't like confrontation but my partner will and they fall out regularly (nothing ever serious which with time is forgotten).

Fast forward back to present day and he has come to see his granddaughter twice, despite being in town multiple times to see his other kids, and being in the city, which is en-route through our town, to work every few weeks. He fell out with my partner because he invited us to his flat when our baby was a newborn, and we said no as we didn't want to drag her on a 4-5 hour round trip when she's so little. Since then, we went to a Christmas family event he was at, and he spent the entire time in a different room and spent maybe 10 minutes total with our daughter (in a 4 hour visit). 

He has since asked us again to go and see him and we've said no because he has put the bare minimum into getting to know his granddaughter by meeting her 3 times. He sent a huge angry message saying if we want her to know him we should put the effort in to going to see him. I disagree and think he should be the one coming to see us?

I feel bad always saying no to him inviting us to his but he's so often nearby and doesn't let us know, but wants us to regularly make very long trips to go sit in his (not very baby-friendly) flat.

Since they didn't have any code or information (they were just to give him something physical before the actual gift), I told him to not worry about it, But I asked why he was ""throwing away"" my gift  during an argument that had nothing to do about it.

His reasons were:

1- if he doesn't have a relationship with me he doesn't want to accept any gift (because apparently he did it in the past with someone else and regretted it)

2- like my sister (17F) refused her birthday gift when we were at the start of our relationship,(she said she felt weird for accepting an expensive gift from a stranger he had met one time), he was allowed to refuse it too.

So when she came home she was mad at me and said that all I needed was common sense to remember to turn both things on. (I don't disagree tbf)

A couple hours after the smell of the food was all throughout the house and it put me on edge so I was already nervous when I asked her what it was and she said ""food"" I went downstairs to check it out, it was some sort of meat and gravy with mashed potato sitting on top of it. (The meat was a dull brown grey colour, it smelt weird, the potatoes were lumpy and the gravy was watery)

A textural nightmare (and the smell truly did not help)

The most fear-filling part was the fact that the mashed potatoes were on top of the liquid. She knows that I don't like it because it's genuinely so off-putting to my tastebuds and is one of the biggest things I struggle with.

I know that's the way she normally does it for everyone else so I didn't complain about it, I just kind of poked at it and asked her if I could use a bowl to flip it (Still would be a texture nightmare just less daunting) she said whatever and mumbled under her breath and said something along the lines of ""it's not my fault that's there's so many issues I have to note down and remember"" and sounded really mad and upset.

I thought it would be easier if I just heated up a frozen meal because I know it's something I can and will eat so I wrapped the food up and started to grab something from the freezer that I paid for earlier with my money from work and she said ""If you don't want to eat it tell me that way I can give it to Steve (Fake name for my stepdad) tomorrow"" I said ""no I'll save it for lunch tomorrow"".

But, somehow the call never happened. They were always impossible to reach but everyone in the family had the same experience so I thought something was wrong. I reached out concerned and they finally told me that stuff was going on. This was four months later. They said they weren't able to financially at the time so they needed time. I said I understood and I didn't follow up for a while. When I did it wasn't even asking for payment, it was asking how they were doing or sharing memes or videos they would like.

I reached out and asked about the commission and they left me on read while responding in the group chat.

I had been commissioned before by them and they paid right away. So, this time I completed the work then showed them and expected they would send the money. They didn't. They wanted to arrange a call with me and so I thought they had some notes which was fine.

But, somehow the call never happened. They were always impossible to reach but everyone in the family had the same experience so I thought something was wrong. I reached out concerned and they finally told me that stuff was going on. This was four months later. They said they weren't able to financially at the time so they needed time. I said I understood and I didn't follow up for a while. When I did it wasn't even asking for payment, it was asking how they were doing or sharing memes or videos they would like. They never responded. 

Just last week I remembered, hey, they still didn't make any attempt and when I checked our chat I realized it had been over a year since they replied to me and it's just about 2 years since they've owed me. But in a group we're both in they were offering to pay money for something else. Just a bit less than what they owe me. I reached out and asked about the commission and they left me on read while responding in the group chat.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate to say that my twin sister is my favorite person in the world. We used to hang out with each other all the time and shared a room until we went to college.

120,1d3zcxo,WIBTA for asking food to be replaced if eaten entirely?,"Repost because the first one got deleted, I'm not sure what I did wrong.

I (22) recently moved in with my partner's family following graduation. I have not lived with my bio family for about a year due to concerns for my safety, as well as physical and mental health. As many know, finding a job currently is incredibly challenging. Finding a job particular to my major has also been challenging. At the moment, I have been working on job applications, unpacking, cleaning, and settling in, as I have only been fully living here for about one month. Additionally, until about a year ago, I was denied the possibility of getting a job due to familial concerns. This is all to say, I have very limited funds and am currently unable to increase my funds, which I hopefully will manage to change soon.

Currently, my partner covers most expenses when it comes to food and other recreational things, which we have mostly limited, aside from special occasions around once a month, if that. I have certain dietary restrictions related to my health. These restrictions are not too excessive, for the most part I have to be careful with certain carbs, meats, and fats, and I have to have a lot of vegetables in my diet. I will admit that I often fail to be as stricts as I need to be when it comes to my restrictions. However, when I cook for the house or get things for myself to eat, I try to make sure I make affordable subsitutions which are better for my health but still taste good to everyone else (i.e. vegan curry which can have chicken added).

Continuously, when my partner and I get groceries, I will leave them out to share with people as I don't mind sharing, especially since I don't want the food to go bad. However, the problem comes when I go to get myself some of my food that I/my partner has purchased and it's completely gone because my partner's family eats it, and I haven't had any of it. Again, I don't mind sharing, and I'm glad that they like it, but we can't afford to continuously replace what they eat, especially if we aren't going to get any of it. I have mentioned this before and they told me they would replace it, but they never do. I feel like I should mention it again more directly, but I'm worried I might be being rude, especially since I'm being allowed to stay here. All I ask is that if they eat something, they replace it, or at least save us some of it.

TLDR; My partner's family keeps eating my food without leaving us any. I am fine with sharing, as long as they replace it or leave us some, but they do not.

I'm in an ongoing and very stressful battle with my employer because I'm pregnant. My HR has said some things to me that I haven't been happy with, like comparing me to other pregnant employees they've had (""they never took as much absence as you, so we don't understand why you've been off so much""). They've told me this can't be normal and made me very nervous about the health of my pregnancy at times, sent me to my doctor over and over (they've basically always told me that my morning sickness is a normal part of pregnancy and there's nothing really I can do. I have told my work this). They've brought up to me that me being absent affects the team greatly and to think of my coworkers, basically guilt tripping me about needing the time off. I don't think any of this has been very professional.

This week it has come to a head and they have referred me to Occupational Health. They've said that what Oc Health says may have an impact on my probation. Basically theyve made it very clear to me that they are making an effort to get rid of me. I called my mum to talk about it because I was crying and hysterical because despite my trouble with HR, I love my job. I don't want to lose it. I told her all about the situation and she basically just told me that my employer was well within their rights to treat me this way and that its just part of life. She said that she even agrees with some of their points. She implied this was a consequence of me getting pregnant whilst still on probation, which sucked to hear.

I understand that what my employer is doing is sometimes just a part of life. But I called for a little support and what my mum said just made it worse. I told her that I had called for a little support when I felt inconsolable and that I didn't need her reiterating my employers words to me right now. I said it felt like she was on their side when really what I needed was my mother to tell me that I'd be okay.

126,1d3yeoo,AITA for conditioning my father out of his bad behavior like a dog?,"My [17M] father [50M] is a real piece of work. I can't even describe him in the proper word count. I'm sure there's a post somewhere on my account that goes into further detail. At it's bare bones, he treats me, my sisters [both 19F], and my mom [49F] like shit and then expects us to cater to his every whim.

I've decided lately, I'm not going to put up with it, I'll treat him like a dog. I'll reward good behavior with being nice to him, and I'll punish bad behavior with being mean to him. It's so childish that it almost seems silly.

Primary example, he loves to shake the shit out of our doors when it's quiet because he thinks it's hilarious. It isn't. Tonight, he did that while I was in my sister's room. I told him it was unnecessary and rude.

Last night, after yelling at me when I got home from vacation, he asked me to make him a sandwich. I told him no, that he's a grown man, and that he can make his own damn sandwich.

He hasn't done anything major since I made this decision, but lord I'm waiting for when he does.

[Though for a seperate reason, I don't tell him that I love him, haven't since I was 7 because it hasn't been true since I was 7. This is relevant in a moment].

My sister has noticed me doing this ""conditioning"" and has told me that I need to start being nicer and quit being an asshole to him. When I tried explaining why I was doing what I was doing, she told me that he still deserves to hear and see that he's loved by me.

I failed to mention that he isn't.

At it's bare bones, he treats me, my sisters [both 19F], and my mom [49F] like shit and then expects us to cater to his every whim.

I've decided lately, I'm not going to put up with it, I'll treat him like a dog. I'll reward good behavior with being nice to him, and I'll punish bad behavior with being mean to him. It's so childish that it almost seems silly.

Primary example, he loves to shake the shit out of our doors when it's quiet because he thinks it's hilarious. It isn't. Tonight, he did that while I was in my sister's room. I told him it was unnecessary and rude.

Last night, after yelling at me when I got home from vacation, he asked me to make him a sandwich. I told him no, that he's a grown man, and that he can make his own damn sandwich.

He hasn't done anything major since I made this decision, but lord I'm waiting for when he does.

[Though for a seperate reason, I don't tell him that I love him, haven't since I was 7 because it hasn't been true since I was 7. This is relevant in a moment].

My sister has noticed me doing this ""conditioning"" and has told me that I need to start being nicer and quit being an asshole to him. When I tried explaining why I was doing what I was doing, she told me that he still deserves to hear and see that he's loved by me.

I failed to mention that he isn't.

127,1d3ye7k,AITA for refusing to help my brother pay his debt?,"I (19F) have an argument with my mom (48F) over my brother (27M). My brother is now married and moved out of my parents house and now living in his wife‚Äôs house . My brother always ask for money from my parents even after he moved out. He and his wife both have jobs. My mom usually gives them $3.000 a month out of her $8.000 income per month but she gives me less than $1.000. But I‚Äôm okay with that because my parents have saved money to buy us both of their kids lands and properties. I have been working part time since high school to help paying for my college and to buy myself a nice laptop for studying. There were no problems here until my mother recently stopped working due to health problems.

My brother started coming to my parents house and demanding large amounts of money. He even ask me if i could lend him some money and i ended up lending him some. But he keep asking me for more money and told me to get a full time job instead of going to college. One night my father talked about it with my brother and my brother was mad about it. He stopped coming over for a while but yesterday he came.

He told mom that he needed money. But mom doesn‚Äôt have any because she has used her savings to buy a land for me and gave the rest of the money to my brother. So they asked me if i have some. I answered that i only have $15 and have used the rest of my savings to buy a new laptop and a bicycle to go to college and part time work because they sold my motorcycle and give the money to my brother. They both looked very upset and she took that $15 anyway. 

This morning my mom told me that my brother is actually in debt because of his gambling addiction. She asked me if i could help him paying off his debt but i refused because I think it‚Äôs his problem and it‚Äôs a consequence for his gambling problem. Now my mom has refused to talk to me.

Note : I actually still have some money in my bank account. My father is often working outside the city so he is rarely seen at home. My parents were rich but things are different since mom got sick and dad has to work outside the city.

128,1d3y4np,AITA for how I reacted to my cousin cousin telling me she‚Äôd miss my birthday for her gfs sisters husband?,"Basically I‚Äôm turning 21 this year. My birthday is in June and I let everyone know it would be between two dates and so I could find out which of these two days would be better at the beginning of this month (may). I did this because I wanted to make sure it was on a day the majority of people could attend so if it couldn‚Äôt be on the day of my actual birthday it could be the week after. I can‚Äôt move it again because I‚Äôve already put in the leave. 

My cousin and I haven‚Äôt always had the best relationship but we did become close for a while a couple years ago. Now she‚Äôs got a gf and I‚Äôm happy for her but she‚Äôll cancel plans with me for her gf. I‚Äôm fine with that every once in a while but not basically everytime we‚Äôve got plans. 

Her gfs brother in law told them at the beginning of this week to come to their house for his birthday and they‚Äôre going. He‚Äôs turning 32 which isn‚Äôt that much of an important age. 

I told her I couldn‚Äôt lie that I‚Äôm pretty upset because a 21st is a special birthday and I told her first and well in advance. She said that sometimes plans change and she‚Äôll do something with me the week after. I get plans change but I can never have my 21st again and she‚Äôll miss it for someone else. 

She told me to grow up and not expect things to always go my way. I said didn‚Äôt appreciate her always putting me last and that she has never celebrated my birthday with me and I‚Äôd not speak to her if she actually missed it. 

We‚Äôre currently not speaking but did I take it too far? Should I have just done something with her the next week instead? 

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: so I thought my post made sense in my head but I need to clarify, I AM NOT having two parties. I sent the message in advance to find out which day would be better for the majority of people to attend and then have it on that day so they still have plenty of time to make plans on the other day. I am not someone who requires two. 

Edit again: I‚Äôm very sorry guys English is not my first language so I‚Äôm sorry if my post is confusing. I sent the message first and confirmed with everyone on that day so I cannot move it.

129,1d3y4di,AITA for asking someone to turn down their sound at the coffee shop?,"My boyfriend and I were working from a coffee shop today. It had one of those quiet back rooms where people go for complete silence. We call it the ""bootcamp"" room because people go there when they really need to drill down in silence. Honestly we try not to go there too much because every now and then we feel the need to whisper to each other and then we feel bad for distracting the others. That's the vibe of the room. 

Today we happened to be the only people there. We were working for at least an hour before someone came in. She threw the door open (normally everyone closes it to block out the rest of the coffee shop noise) and then started to play a video at full volume. I closed the door and put headphones in but I could still hear her video even over my blasting electronic music. I walked over to my bf (we were sitting a bit apart so we could focus) and he was clearly also thrown off by the incomer. 

I decided to go up to her at this point, with the intention of nicely asking her to turn it down. Not turn it off, just turn it down so that I wouldn't hear it over my headphones. 

Here's where I may be TA - I tapped her lightly to get her attention and she immediately responded ""Can you not touch me"" and glared at me. I apologized immediately. I'm from an Eastern European family so it came naturally to me, but I recognize that in the US personal space is super important. After apologizing I asked - ""Do you mind turning it down a bit?"". She responded, glaring at me, ""This is awkward because I always work here and you're the first one who's said anything"" and ""you have those headphones don't you"". I told her that both of us were getting super distracted and that I could hear her video over the headphones. She continued to glare at me and ignore me and then my boyfriend said we should go. I gathered my stuff and followed him out. Btw, we have been visiting this cafe regularly for the past 4 years and I don't remember ever seeing this girl.

For context on Sarah, ever since from school, to meet ups, to even get togethers that she hosts or books, she is late to them. 30min-1hr late on average. Always something happening, excuses here and there, always late. I have been very forgiving on majority of it. A lot of ""dont worry, its fine"" kind of brushing off. She has a knack for rescheduling continously.

Further frustrstion context, I've asked the group who is coming to the trip to add some items in the trip planning excel sheet. We will all be staying in the same accomodation, and I need definite numbers on who is coming. I make plans and group calls but theyre always rescheduled, especially by Sarah. We scheduled a call (after a few times it being rescheduled) as we hadnt sat down and had a proper planning call for a few months, we also really needed to settle for an accomodation so I can cancel the others out. While others made time to plan, Sarah asked to reschedule again last minute when it was a couple hours before we had a planning call. It infuriated me as it kept happening over and over again. 

I then told her we needed to talk and told her how I felt, saying my time was not considered to planning things, being on time and the amount of push backs over and over again. I wanted to be honest to her and I said it straight like it is. I came off pretty frustrated and harsh, but I had to put my foot down for once after this had been happening too many times. She knew I was not happy with the planning but found this surprising. I proceeded to tell her that maybe I need to separate most parts of the trip on a separate accomodation from them as the lack of participation and help is becoming too much for me. Told her I'll book my own space, meet somewhere in the cities some days and some days to myself. She didnt like that and got even more upset. She then started telling me that the other girls and herself were overwhelmed by my planning the trip due to how detailed it was. I just wanted them to pick out accomodation options. She proceeded to say that she didnt expect this and left to cool off.

I definitely see myself ATA for putting myself through this situation for as long as I have despite my better judgement.",0.0,1.0063115358352661,1,0
133,1d3wvs1,AITA because I don't want to combine friend groups?,"So I (24F) got a roommate (26F) recently. We share a couple of classes together, and we get along pretty well. We got into a fight recently because despite us getting along together really well the last couple of months, I won't invite her into my other friend groups. 

Before we moved in together, it was clear that  we had way different life experiences and even ideologies on things, but we can have very mature conversations even with our disagreements. She also knows I am a very independent person and do my own thing, but she also likes to exhibit very motherly like behavior. We often make jokes to each other that we're gonna fix each other's bad habits but I always knew it was a joke and thought she did too. 

I have several different friend groups as I moved around a lot, and a lot of them have very diverse lifestyles and backgrounds. In general, I can tell who will get along with who and keep my groups pretty peaceful accordingly. Only 2 people in my life are in all my friend chats, my best friends. Nothing super polarizing happens in any chats, it's just that she is very gullible and naive, and doesn't understand sarcasm very well. She isn't very good at sensing tone, which is fine, but in my groups you kinda need to to know when to switch conversations or diffuse situations. 

I told her this multiple times but she still thinks it's just because of boundaries I built around myself, and I need to learn to let people in. I got mad at this because I felt like  she was treating me like an emotional child, and I told her it's not a boundary or trust issue, it's just that they would not get along, and I believe it would end in an argument that would ruin our relationship. She retorted that I wasn't  a know-it-all, and that she wants to meet them. I told her that she's acting like my parents wanting to my SO. I like having separate friends groups and don't need anyone to be involved in every little thing in my  life. She stormed out and we haven't spoken in a week. However, within the last day she has started to scoff at me when she sees me, which I think proves my point. 

However, the other day I overheard her saying I was two-faced and just pretending to be her friend. I am unsure if it was reasonable to interpret our argument like that, but that wasn't what I meant.

My DH, baby, and I moved in with my MIL out of necessity on both ends. For us it was purely financial and for MIL as well. She had been living with my SIL and she would complain that she was being mistreated by SIL. My MIL is outwardly very kind and caring but I've come to realize she has some mental instability. She's very helpful and adores my baby but there has been some back in the past forth that wasn't too serious but it definitely built up the tension. Mainly comments about how DH and I parent or how we don't want to parent in a way that obviously offends her. Whenever it was really an issue I just let her know it wasn't something I was interested in trying and she would kinda huff and sulk in her room. That really is her response to any kind of comment and it had start to annoy me. Once my SIL ask DH if I didn't like MIL because MIL felt like she was isolated in her room and I didn't want her around. It wasn't true but I'll admit I did ignore her whenever she would obnoxiously interject with her opinion but I didn't try and exclude her at all. I just really loved being a mom and really focused my attention and energy into and was tuning out the noise so to speak. DH did speak up for me and let SIL know that she was being obnoxious and SIL totally understood. It made me realize she is someone who likes to paint a bad picture of someone to make herself appear the victim. The cracks really started to appear before me when my DH let me know about that convo with his sister privately. He also let me know that his sister was so happy to have MIL out of the home and that MIL was obnoxious and rude all the time and they were honestly fed up with her antics in the few years she had lived with them. Months go by and nothing too serious has happened but DH and I are started to feel strained dealing with MILs antics. She really is helpful and I often thank her and try and discuss things with her because I wanted to avoid what happened today.

On to what happened or where it started. It's Memorial Day and I wanted to do something with my now toddler that wasn't too expensive as we are still not in a great place financially. All I wanted to do was get a new book at the Barnes & Noble for my toddler as she had started to memorize her favorite books so I figured my kid needed something new to try and memorize. DH hates B&N as it's on the other side of town and in a bad area. MIL suggests a school supply store close by and while I am wary I agree we all load up and go. We get to the store and it actually turned out to be a cool store...if it were open. It was closed for Memorial Day and the disappointment really got to my already tired and hot toddler. My kid had an absolute meltdown for the first time. We had planned to go to SILs house for a visit but I decided it was time to go home. We had even asked my toddler if the wanted to visit ""aunties house"" and she usually gets excited as she loves her auntie, uncle, and cousins who adore her. This time she said ""no aunties house"" which was another first and so I insisted DH drop us off and they go as MIL really wanted to pick up her iPad she left behind a few days prior. He agreed and as he was putting on a song when MIL loudly asked as my child is crying and after it was understood we would be dropped off at home ""DO YOU WANT TO GO TO AUNTIES HOUSE"" which caused my kid to cry even louder ""LETS GO TO AUNTIES YAY!"" and I turn around and ask her to ""please stop"" which causes her to huff and sulk. We get dropped off at home and I calm my child down and just chill and my kid is happy again but it really was something that bothered me. Later I heard from MIL how I am ""giving in to my Childs demands and my toddler now knows they can just cry and get what they want"" and that really soured me toward her even more so. I admit I was rude and outwardly annoyed with her. I could see it coming to a head. We were all fed up with each other and today it blew up over something dumb but basically we tried to work out our issues and MIL kept stating she felt attacked and started to cry. I told her to stop crying and just talk no one is doing that and she cannot emotionally manipulate us to get her way. I guess that was my mistake as she claimed she wasn't and that she would cry if she wanted to and for me to not mouth off. I could see the fury in her and I defiantly let her know I would not be silent any longer and she said then she would keep crying and I said that was fine but it was childish and after that she was enraged and with clenched fists called me an ""effinng bitxh"" and ran to her room to cry.

I was pretty mad about it at first but accepted her apology as I felt it was sincere. Here is where I think I was the AH. Her behavior has become erratic and there was a situation that occurred that has lead DH and I to believe she is mentally declining due to her poor health and age.

135,1d3wmtu,AITAH for refusing to pay more for rent when my roommate asks me in the middle of a lease agreement? ,"I share a townhouse with approximately 1200 square feet with one other roommate, who had initially listed the room on Facebook marketplace at $900 for my room. For context, my room is 98.5 ft^2, while hers is more than double the size at 204 ft^2, including a private balcony. She pays $1700, which due to the size of her room, seemed justified. Her room also has the shared washer/dryer within it, a bigger walk-in closet, and attached private bathroom. My bathroom is detached and includes a tub, but she occasionally gives her dog baths in this tub. 

She recently sat me down and told me that she does not think this is a fair split and that we should do a 60/40 split for the last 2 months of the lease agreement (on 6-month lease). She said that we have to also consider the common areas and that she had made some errors in her calculations before listing the room on Facebook. I told her that I was open to a renegotiation upon lease renewal, but made it clear that she should honor the $900 price she attached to the listing for the remainder of this lease. Essentially, I felt forced into agreeing to a nearly $140 increase due to her guilt-tripping. I can certainly afford way more than I am paying, but I am extremely frugal - it is the principle of honoring a verbal agreement. 

(Keep in mind that even in the shared areas, there is not a 50-50 split of any of the closet spaces or kitchen cabinets)

Unfortunately, while both our names have been listed on the lease agreement, the individual amounts have not been. I have made it clear that I am not going to resign the lease and that she will have to find another roommate. The extra $140 per month for the remainder of the lease is not worth the headaches. On top of this, she has said that she does not want it to feel awkward in her apartment (*edit, this is supposed to be ‚Äòour‚Äô), despite making this conversation extremely awkward. 

I let the private landlord know about the situation, so future tenants are not taken advantage of. A roommate initially renting for $2600 should certainly not be asking for more each month, if they are financially sound.

I work in a fast food. A family came in 5 minutes before we close in which I didn't have any problem with. My coworkers and I were happy to serve them. One of my coworkers told them upon ordering that we're closing at a specific time (which is in 5 minutes). Tbh, idk what was their response. Anyway, as we were making their order, I saw them sat down and really seem like they were gonna stay for a long time. It seemed like they were making themselves comfortable in which again I don't have a problem but the fact that we're closing in few minutes, I feel like I need to approach them and remind them just in case they forgot the time or whatsoever. Upon approaching them, I reminded them POLITELY that we're closing in 3 minutes. The wife quickly told me ""yes we know"" and I said okay and I still smiled at them. 

The moment we are closed, they just started eating. I had to approach them again because seems like they have no idea that we are already closed.

I work in a fast food. A family came in 5 minutes before we close in which I didn't have any problem with. My coworkers and I were happy to serve them. One of my coworkers told them upon ordering that we're closing at a specific time (which is in 5 minutes). Tbh, idk what was their response. Anyway, as we were making their order, I saw them sat down and really seem like they were gonna stay for a long time. It seemed like they were making themselves comfortable in which again I don't have a problem but the fact that we're closing in few minutes, I feel like I need to approach them and remind them just in case they forgot the time or whatsoever. Upon approaching them, I reminded them POLITELY that we're closing in 3 minutes. The wife quickly told me ""yes we know"" and I said okay and I still smiled at them. 

The moment we are closed, they just started eating. I had to approach them again because seems like they have no idea that we are already closed.

141,1d3w5iq,AITA for not letting my friend have the master bedroom,"(sorry if this is really jumbled, im running on emotion rn)

I (19f) am moving into a duplex with three girls. We will call them, Fawn, Stella, and Izzy (all 19f) at the start of August. We have already signed the lease and paid the deposit. It‚Äôs a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom house and our rent is 2200 a month. 

Originally we had planned to all pay 550 a month then split utilities equally. But as we started figuring out which two would share a bathroom and who would get the master, we realized we would have to adjust the costs.

Izzy and Stella have known each other for years and decided they would share a bathroom. This left it between me and Fawn (who is also my best friend since middle school) to decide who gets the master and who to divide the rent stuff.

She suggested that we have the person who has the master pay the internet but I don‚Äôt think that is fair to the other two that share a bathroom. I suggested a 580, 560, 530, 530 split to make things fair all while we split the internet and utilities evenly between us four. 

Fawn keeps bringing up that she wants the master to have more closet space and more room to have a desk to work at but does not want to pay a higher price. I also want the master, not for any specific reason other than wanting a bigger room. I‚Äôm willing to let her have the master as long as she is willing to pay the higher rent. 

One thing Fawn mentioned was that she doesn‚Äôt think Stella and Izzy should get a lower rent when they picked their rooms first, but it‚Äôs not like she wanted to share a bathroom so I don‚Äôt see the point in that argument. 

I am willing to pay the higher rent for the bigger room, and I refuse to pay the same amount for her to have a bigger room, walk-in closet, and en-suite bathroom. That doesn‚Äôt seem fair to me. She keeps thinking that it‚Äôll be more fair to keep the rent equal and then divide the utilities some weird way and I don‚Äôt know how to get her to understand that it doesn‚Äôt work like that. If anything it will make the monthly payments more unequal and less predictable. 

With both plans the person with the master will be paying more it‚Äôs just a matter of where the money is coming from.

I don‚Äôt want to take something she really wants and I don‚Äôt want this to drive a wedge between us. But I don‚Äôt know how to make her understand. Looking for outside opinions. AITA for not letting her have the master bedroom without paying extra rent.

[edit] she also texted my boyfriend, knowing he and I were hanging out, that she needed to talk to him about something. She wanted him to promise to ‚Äúlet her handle it‚Äù and not tell me.

146,1d3v46u,AITAH for giving up?,"I (23 M) semi-recently moved to a new state to pursue work. Although I was very nervous about starting work in a new area, without knowing anyone, I soon became friends with a few people around my age at work that made the transition process a lot easier for myself. For the sake of anonymity, we will refer to one of these people by the fake name Abe. Abe worked in my department, having started a few weeks before me. He had also moved from several states away, so I had a rough understanding of what he was going through.

Abe and I started to hang out with each other. After suggesting a game night, he invited myself and another coworker over to have game night with himself and his roommate. We had a lot of fun and I was genuinely happy to be making these sorts of relationships and connections with other people. For a while, we continued to hang out with each other, such as by having a game night once a month. Other people were eventually added to the ‚Äúgame night group‚Äù which made things even better.

The problem primarily stems from the point when Abe decided to switch to a different department. I was very saddened to hear this news as I knew it would make it very difficult to talk or interact with Abe during the day. I had grown to enjoy our friendship and knew that by switching to a different department our whole dynamic would change and he wouldn‚Äôt want to/ be able to talk to me as much/ at all. When I had voiced my feeling of the situation to him, he had said that he would ‚Äúswing by and chat‚Äù with me as he commonly did with his roommate who also worked at the same company. He had also told me that he would still want to hang out with me. I was happy to hear this and left it at that.

After he had switched to a different department, I would try and visit Abe from time to time. In the area that I worked in the departments were only slightly divided, meaning that whenever I was slightly ‚Äúfree‚Äù I could visit Abe and chat with him. For a while, Abe was training in his departments tasks and until he got a hang of his responsibilities, he wasn‚Äôt really going to be able to ‚Äústop by and chat‚Äù. After realizing that this was the case, I went about work as usual and would try my best to stop by and chat when I had free time.

The reason that I feel like an AH is because I‚Äôm done. It feels as though Abe doesn‚Äôt want to be my friend. He doesn‚Äôt try and talk to me in the work space. It‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt have the time as I see him chatting up a storm with other people that I know ow have no bearing on what he does work-wise. As of writing this post, he hasn‚Äôt had a conversation with me(or at least one started by himself) in three weeks. As for hanging out outside of work, the last time I was over his place was 4 months ago. The only times we have hung out have been initiated by myself. I‚Äôm just tired of being the only one that is trying to be friends. So unless he puts in effort and tries to be friends with me, I‚Äôm done.

So AITAH for giving up and stopping trying to be friends with him?

When I had voiced my feeling of the situation to him, he had said that he would ‚Äúswing by and chat‚Äù with me as he commonly did with his roommate who also worked at the same company. He had also told me that he would still want to hang out with me. I was happy to hear this and left it at that.

After he had switched to a different department, I would try and visit Abe from time to time. In the area that I worked in the departments were only slightly divided, meaning that whenever I was slightly ‚Äúfree‚Äù I could visit Abe and chat with him. For a while, Abe was training in his departments tasks and until he got a hang of his responsibilities, he wasn‚Äôt really going to be able to ‚Äústop by and chat‚Äù. After realizing that this was the case, I went about work as usual and would try my best to stop by and chat when I had free time.

The reason that I feel like an AH is because I‚Äôm done. It feels as though Abe doesn‚Äôt want to be my friend. He doesn‚Äôt try and talk to me in the work space. It‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt have the time as I see him chatting up a storm with other people that I know ow have no bearing on what he does work-wise. As of writing this post, he hasn‚Äôt had a conversation with me(or at least one started by himself) in three weeks. As for hanging out outside of work, the last time I was over his place was 4 months ago. The only times we have hung out have been initiated by myself. I‚Äôm just tired of being the only one that is trying to be friends. So unless he puts in effort and tries to be friends with me, I‚Äôm done.

So AITAH for giving up and stopping trying to be friends with him?

147,1d3uzfh,AITA for telling off my mom for not inviting me to an important family event?,"So, this has happened several times where I don‚Äôt get invited to important family events. 

My much loved uncle came traveled across the country to visit my family of origin.
When I heard (a few months earlier) that he might be coming I asked when, as in, what date was he coming.
My Mom would not answer, so I asked my older sibling to please give me a heads up when he was coming. I asked the sibling because my mom has often forgotten to invite me when these events happen. I‚Äôve missed out on many family events because I‚Äôve been ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô by my mom.
Just for example, I was forgotten about last year when my niece got married. My brother, the niece‚Äôs dad said he invited me but I never received an invitation. The day before the wedding, my niece called me, upset that I had not RSVPed her wedding and wondered if I was coming. I told her I had no idea. 
My brother said he sent the invite but I know he lied because everyone else got a ‚Äòsave the day‚Äô card and then an invite. I received neither.
Back to the original story: My mom and brother planned a big dinner for my uncle and invited my other siblings and some nieces and nephews but did not invite me or any of my children.
A couple of days before my uncle arrived for his visit I found out he was coming. I called my mom and I was quite upset and asked her why I was not invited. She said she thought I would be too busy and didn‚Äôt think I would come. 
I was so hurt, so angry! I told her I was coming to see him, basically invited myself to dinner.
Awkwardly I went to the dinner, saw my uncle, who I care about a lot. My mom has not apologized, nor is she even speaking to me.
In the past, her expectation would be that I apologize for being upset. 
I‚Äôm not going to apologize.

148,1d3uvzt,AITA for wanting support from SO?,"

After a lifetime (54 F) of knowing something about my brain was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, I was finally recently diagnosed as high-functioning autistic with ADHD. 

I started on Straterra about 6 months ago with limited success in symptom reduction. What has helped tremendously is educating myself about strategies to manage my life more efficiently and effectively. I have also found great comfort in reading about and hearing from other people with similar neuro-spiciness. 

So, I have been with my partner for over 10 years (60 M). He has a very successful career and is super responsible. He takes great care of us financially and is a wonderful dad to his two daughters. He has also been extremely generous to my daughters and grandchildren. 

I am on the path to finally understanding why life has always felt so much more challenging to me than it should. I am re-learning which parts of me are my personality and which are my disabilities. I am coming to terms with feeling like my family and teachers failed me. Mostly it‚Äôs all been a huge relief. Finally a reason!

Naturally, I have talked about a lot of this with my SO. He has been supportive in my starting therapy, getting tested, and starting meds. But now it seems as if he is ‚Äúover it‚Äù. Anytime I mention anything related to autism or ADHD he either rolls his eyes or tells me it can‚Äôt be an excuse for everything. I don‚Äôt feel like I have ever used it as an excuse. I‚Äôm just trying to understand it all and help myself to be the best me I can be. When we first met he told me he had PTSD and I learned everything I could about it to best know and support him.

FYI: I have gotten three degrees in the past 10 years. I manage our rental properties and vacation property. I do 100% of the cooking, cleaning, shopping, laundry and errands.

150,1d3ui6a,WIBTA if I missed my sister‚Äôs graduation ,"Throwaway account. She‚Äôs graduating from high school and I would be attending the prom/ball which seems to be a bigger deal than the graduation itself. The reason being possible migration issues.


I‚Äôll be spending the summer doing a US road trip (for about 2 months) and then go back home, I‚Äôll be back in time for the graduation ball and her birthday. There‚Äôs a few events that I was planning to go to during October and November, it makes more sense to stay instead of flying twice. 


Since I‚Äôll already be there I thought about staying for the ski season because I got an Ikon pass, the issue is that her graduation even is on December and I worry about the migration officers refusing my entry for going in and out frequently and it would suck ass if I lose $1.2k for not being able to use the ikon pass.


I get that you only have 1 high school graduation. I didn‚Äôt think mine was a big deal and barely remember it, it was 8 years ago, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs university. We don‚Äôt have the best relationship but she might get upset by it or maybe she wouldn‚Äôt care.

I would also be skipping Christmas, but I almost did that last year and my family seemed to be mostly ok with it

151,1d3udac,WIBTA if I missed my boyfriend‚Äôs brothers wedding for a family party,"Hey Reddit, 

I‚Äôm in a bit of a pickle here- 

Context: my (28f) boyfriend (28m) and I have been together for basically ever (13 years). Our families are both relatively close but not like actively reaching out every day for a chat. I‚Äôm very close with my own family and will occasionally catch up with his. We live in two different states. 

I originally had plans of traveling back to our home town to visit my family. Flights booked- They are putting together a party one day on the weekend that I am there so I can see everyone and hang. Well, my boyfriend‚Äôs brother randomly gets engaged and is planning a wedding now for that same day. (He also lives near our hometown) Timeline of the day: wedding is at 2 and the party starts at 1. The drive to the wedding is 1 hour one way. I feel bad in that I had my family planning this party for me to be there and now I feel like I‚Äôm being tugged in another direction to be somewhere else for a wedding. 

Thoughts? Part of me feels obligated to be there for my long term boyfriend‚Äôs brother and show support and love but part of me really misses my family and wants to spend all my time with them. I see them 2x a year. 

TLDR: my boyfriend‚Äôs brother is getting married on the same day as my family‚Äôs party. I‚Äôm feeling torn between what to do because I only see my immediate family 2x a year, and haven‚Äôt seen my whole family in over a year. (Out of state)

152,1d3ubnz,AITA for maybe not letting a friend in need crash on ny couch?,"So context here, Ive known (lets call them Jeff) for almost a decade. We've gotten less close but were close back in University. He was super smart-knew facts about all sorts of things, especially tech. I've invited h to game nights and stuff over the years. So were still pretty aquainted.

Unfortunately, he bailed on an event recently. I thought it was a death in the family or something so I just sent a get well message and hoped hed be back soon. Few days later, he's asking for a place to stay. Says he'd been kicked out of his house by his family and his best friend isnt speaking to him. He says its because of something bad he did a long time ago, that presumably has come to light. I dont know much more than that and I didnt ask. He did say police may get involved. 

Now, heres the thing. My lease is ending soon and my roommate and I are gonna look for something cheaper. We both cannot afford to stay here, and Ill likely go back to living with my family while trying to find a job. I know he's in a similar situation, being pretty much bankrupt. I also dont know what hes done, but also dont know if thatd impact my choice. The roommate is fine with it.

On the one hand, I dont want to be responsible for someone to end up on the streets. On the other hand, I don't know what could be so bad that Jeff's own family would kick them out... If it was just living on the couch, thatd be one thing, but its more than that. Id likely have to help them find a job and a new place to stay once they move out. I know its not my responsibility, but if I was in their shoes Id want someone to help me... even if what they did was horrible... do they really deserve to be on the street and homeless?
