0,1d481lm,AITA for not knowing the boundaries and requirements of my schoolmates?,"So, a bit of context is going to be necessary here. I am a law student in my second year, and this year, I and three other students participated in a project together. You should know that I am autistic and transgender, and I also have ADHD; therefore, social cues are not precisely my thing. I also had terrible experiences with people regarding the acceptance of me as a person, and consequently, I am pretty paranoid about relationships. This project included some work in the school and a funded simulated court in another country. For most of the project, everything worked relatively smoothly, and there were no significant conflicts between us. 

As we approached the end of the project, I started feeling that I was ""no longer part of the group"", and they did not want me there anymore. But I still got invited to all the group's hangouts, so I said, well, it is probably just paranoia. They also often started group conversations about people not respecting etiquette, but they never explicitly mentioned that I was causing the problems.

However, on the very last day, one of them organised a hangout; not only did they not invite me for it(which is sad, but honestly not that big of an issue), but moreover, they actively tried to conceal the fact that they did so for them not having to explain that to me.

Well, unfortunately, I found out and confronted one of them(this is probably strong basically asked her to tell me next time to save my emotions  ), and she basically said(what I was thinking was happening) that they didn't like me, they were sick of my behaviour that they tried against me, and I did not follow. (At that time, they did not tell me what I had done wrong) When I apologised for putting them in uncomfortable situations and not knowing the facts, they lashed out that I was trying to put the blame on them and I am a child etc, etc. 

They mentioned extensive categories of problems, including, not following etiquette, not respecting personal boundaries, and acting stupid. They noted that they tried to give me cues, but it didn't work, and they did not know how to tell me more, so they just gave up. 

For me, the entire thing has had devastating effects; basically, 2,5 years of therapy and gaining back the trust of other people went to the trashcan.

1,1d47nbz,UPDATE: AITA for threatening to kick out my niece after she hacked my daughter‚Äôs Roblox account?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cv4m1h/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_out_my_niece_after/

Thank you all for your advice! My sister and niece moved out last week, she‚Äôs in the process of getting an apartment and they‚Äôre temporarily staying with a friend of my sister‚Äôs for the time being. I warned her that if I contacted the developers, they would get her daughter banned, so either way my niece wasn‚Äôt keeping the stuff she stole, so she should try minimise her losses. She claimed I had no proof her daughter hacked the account and refused to compromise. She said I was petty and childish for making them ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù over a kid‚Äôs video game. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I feel bad, I really do. My sister and I never really got along as kids so I was hoping at least our kids could have a good relationship with each other. But still, they were inevitably going to leave at some point so I suppose I only sped up the process.

Now that my niece is gone, my daughter seems a lot happier now. She told me she was perfectly fine, but I knew her well enough to know that she wasn‚Äôt. Some very kind and generous people here have offered to gift her some of their items to rebuild her account, to which I am extremely grateful, but my daughter said she felt bad about taking stuff from other people. I‚Äôd already reported my niece‚Äôs account, which seemed to have no effect. I‚Äôm not very tech savvy, but I considered contacting the Roblox developers to see if they could reverse the transaction. However, my daughter informed that doing so would only ban the account, losing all of my daughter‚Äôs items in the process.

I would like to extend all my thanks to the commenter that suggested I try and log in to my niece‚Äôs account. Believe it or not, it only took 5 attempts. Turns out that 10 year olds don‚Äôt have the best comprehension of Internet security. Surprisingly, getting into the account was the easy part. I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time looking up how to trade everything back - I swear I‚Äôm getting old. I couldn‚Äôt tell which items were my daughter‚Äôs and which were actually my niece‚Äôs, so I simply transferred everything my niece had just to be safe.

When she came home from school today, I told my daughter I had a fun surprise for her waiting on Roblox. Words can‚Äôt describe how proud of myself I felt when I saw the joy rush back into her face. The ironic part is that my niece had previously won this very rare halo item from this sort of lottery system, which my daughter claims is one of the most expensive items in that game. Now it was transferred to my daughter‚Äôs account, meaning that my daughter walked out of this situation richer than she was to start with. My sister just messaged me in all caps yelling at me that my niece has been through so much and I was just kicking her when she was down. She accused me of stealing from a little girl. I simply told her that, in her own words, it‚Äôs just a bunch of pixels on a screen.

3,1d3tka4,AITA for telling my mom that she's ruining my wedding,"I'm (28F) dealing with my mom's excessive gift-giving of clothes and her intrusive involvement in my wedding planning. Throughout my life, she's sent me numerous packages of clothes, always unsolicited, and mostly not my style. I've tried to politely return the items I don't like, but this hasn't stopped her from sending more.

My fianc√© recently pointed out how her style is very different from mine, often either very matronly or childish. Despite returning 80% of the clothes she sends, she continues to inundate me with more.

The situation escalated with my wedding dress. When we went shopping, she pushed for a matronly dress that I hated, and dismissed the ones I liked. I eventually chose a dress that everyone, including her, seemed to agree was the most flattering. However, the next day she insisted it was too low cut and even showed photos of me in it to her friends at my grandmother's funeral to get validation. She claimed that they all agreed with her and suggested we go shopping again, which I refused.

Despite my clear refusal, she booked another dress shopping appointment, which was a humiliating experience. She showed zoomed-in photos of my chest to the staff, who graciously assured her that it was not revealing.

However, it didn't stop there. In the car leaving the second dress shop she said she was then taking me to shop for rehearsal dinner dresses. I said as politely as possible that I wouldn't be requiring her services for that, to which she matter of factly stated that she wanted to be involved in picking it out. After I flew back home, she began sending rehearsal dinner dress options to my house, none of which suited me and were all returned. Each dress was either not my style or the wrong size. Despite my polite returns and clear communication, she persisted in sending more.

Recently, I planned a trip back to my parents' place to pick up my wedding dress, which I couldn't bring back earlier due to luggage constraints. A day before my flight, my mom texted me that she had booked an alteration appointment for my dress, claiming it needed to fit perfectly and be less revealing. She also mentioned that she had paid $50 for the appointment. After all our previous conflicts over the dress, I was in disbelief that she had not let it go.

I told her that the prior dress shopping experience had been extremely upsetting for me and that I couldn‚Äôt handle it again. Her response was dismissive, stating that both dress shopping experiences had been traumatizing for her too. At this, I lost it and told her that her constantly bulldozing and manipulating me has ruined my wedding.

I‚Äôve always had a bad relationship with my mother as soon as i realized that she didn‚Äôt care about me. I am currently 18 and going to uni in the spring. 
 She is known by me and any person who meets her as a narcissist and a crazy woman. She has taken my phone, my keys (to the car I bought and she has no financials involved), tv, and even food. We have been constantly fighting for probably 3 or 4 years, I just don‚Äôt like her anymore. And i‚Äôm not just saying that to be a mean teenager.

I ignore all the calls from my mom so I don‚Äôt have to hear the voice that literally makes me feel ill to hear sometimes. I make my own food in my bedroom, that I pay for. She only currently pays for my phone. Not even the bed I sleep on. 
Even though I‚Äôve quite literally never been happier, I feel free. At the same time, I feel like there‚Äôs no going back and since i‚Äôm starting college in August and dorming, I‚Äôll have to find somewhere to stay over the summer, and then therefore never live at home again.

I have also said it multiple times throughout the last year or so of the planning stages to remind her that I didn't have the money. She wants the dress from a specific place in a specific color too. She also wanted me to get my hair dyed for the wedding and paid for that no problem.

Now that we are down to the wire she is pressuring me to buy the dress even though I told her (multiple times) that I couldn't afford it.

Long story short we got in an argument about it and I said that if I was going to be forced to buy it, I was going to quit the bridal party.

8,1d3sos8,AITA for telling my friend not to sell my spouse his boat?,"I (42f) have been with my husband (44m) for 20+ years and have two kids. I casually mentioned to him over the weekend that our friend was getting a new boat and that he wanted to sell it to my husband for 5k. It was casual conversation and did not go any further as far as finances or intentions go. As I was making dinner tonight, I overhear him and our son (19m) discuss the agreed upon purchase and payment plan with our friend that they made. For context, two years ago my husband purchased a 13k atv without discussing it with me first. I thought we worked through that incident and that communication would improve. Also, my son  currently lives with us (barely working) and does not pay any bills. It was after I inquired as to what they were talking about that they revealed the plan to me. The plan was that my husband and son were going to both pitch in and pay our friend ""x"" amount each month for however long. Hearing this, I immediately got angry and basically told them hell no and vocalized how messed it was that a purchase like this was not discussed with me due to the cost and commitment, especially after the last purchase argument, plus also the fact that my son has little ambition to work and pays no bills, but yet wants to buy a boat. I am feeling like my husband and son should of discussed this with me before committing. In a fit of frustration, I texted my friend and asked him not to sell the boat to them. AITA? 

Edit: I did not know the sale price until after they agreed to buy it. I realize by adding the price it as if it were a part of the conversation, it appears to give a different perspective. However, I was only trying to keep the story short and merged details.

Edit 2:  When I mentioned it, it was a blanket statement. In no way, shape, or form did I imply he should buy it. It was sheerly a heads up that my friend would be contacting him.

10,1d3si54,AITA for yelling at my brother that he's fucking stupid,"So for memorial day weekend, I had planned to visit my brothers‚Äô and stay the entire weekend. I checked the bags and the trunk two times over, I‚Äôd thought I packed everything. But apparently something slipped my memory- my toothbrush.

When I was unpacking my bags in the guest room along with my girlfriend, I was going through my bathroom bag. I kept digging and digging and lo and behold, there was no toothbrush.

I called my brother and asked if he had a spare toothbrush. ‚ÄúOf course I do‚Äù.

So he delivered me this really average looking toothbrush, I guess the handle looked a little worn down so idk maybe I should've been a little more perceptive. But yk, my lack of perception is what got me here in the first place.

I brushed my teeth but the toothpaste gave this really pungent aftertaste that seemed quite abnormal.

I hollered at him ‚ÄúDude your toothpaste tastes like shit‚Äù

He started laughing like a fucking cartoon character and it weirded out my girlfriend, (she didn‚Äôt know he was autistic in the moment). So idk I just start like yelling at him cause like wtf kind of response is that.

His smartass starts to explain his little plan-

He started recounting this high school basketball game. It was raining apparently. And apparently I forgot to pick him up. He is 25 years old. This was probably 9 years ago.

He said ‚Äúso yeah that toothbrush I gave you, yeah we use it to clean the toilets.‚Äù

Ok so at this point I just assumed the two were connected and I started ranting at him, telling him that he is stupid for doing this shit. I found it pretty \*shitty\* that he gave me that toothbrush just because of some stuff that I forgot to do 9 years ago.

11,1d3sfk4,AITA for demoting my MOH and barring her boyfriend from the wedding?,"My (25f) fiance and I had our Bachelor/Bachelorette parties the same weekend. We told the wedding party we'd like to finish the parties by having dinner together on Saturday.

Marie(24f MOH) and her boyfriend Rob(28m) are in the wedding. Our group hangs out fairly regularly and anytime Rob was around he would say that the women are ruining the bachelor party because of the dinner. He said that this was my fianc√©'s ""last weekend"" as a single man and that the women shouldn‚Äôt be around. My fiance and I did not confront him about saying these things, which I know we should've done. It really bugged me. My fiance and I had a few conversations about it, but tried to brush it off.

Marie didn't have any plans and one of my other bridesmaids (Liza, 28f) had started planning the party a week prior once she realized Marie hadn't done anything. Liza planned everything. Marie showed up to two of the activities. On Friday, she said she had a bad day at work so she wouldn't be coming. Saturday she said she was sick with a headache. When we met for the group dinner, she told us that she went out to the bars on Friday night and that's why she had the headache and couldn't come to most of the things on Saturday.

 At dinner we were told that we would have to split into 2 tables. I wasn't there, but I've heard from multiple people that Rob said to the group that we should split into ""Dicks and Pussies"". The best man said that he would be sitting next to his girlfriend, Liza. Rob said that that was fine and he could ""sit with the pussies."" The best man told him to go shove it and went inside.

After dinner, I reached out to Marie. I suggested meeting in person to talk, and I asked her to bring Rob. At the restaurant, I expressed my disappointment to Marie for not being there/planning anything. She said she had no excuses and apologized. I decided to make Liza the MOH since she had been supportive and asked Marie to be a bridesmaid instead. 

I told Rob that his ""women ruin everything"" motto throughout the last few weeks had rubbed me the wrong way. He told me that he doesn't change for Marie so why would he change for me. He said that his crude humor is who he is and he's not going to put himself in an environment where he has to walk around on eggshells. He aludded that he would not be coming over anymore because of this ""environment"". I said that if he didn't want to be around me on a normal day, then he was not welcome to our wedding. He said that a wedding was a special day, looked at my fiance and said, ""If you (my fiance) want me there for your big day, I'll be there."". I was furious when he said this and told him that he is absolutely not invited. 

Kicking him out of the wedding party was not my intention going into the conversation. However, after telling him how I felt and that being his reaction... I felt so disrespected.

My girlfriend‚Äôs sister had a dog with her ex, but after they broke up, the sister decided to keep the dog. The ex left for overseas. 

The sister came back to stay with my girlfriend, and persuaded her to take care of the dog together. I protested, as knowing their dynamics, it would be my girlfriend that took care of the dog most of the time (which turned out to be true - family dynamics, shall not comment further)

 Just 2-3 weeks later, the sister went overseas to pursue a job opportunity, leaving the dog in her sole care. The time spent with my girlfriend and I became tied to the taking care of the dog and we were basically talking about the dog and thinking about the welfare of the dog all the time. 

She is not able to send the dog to the sister because the sister‚Äôs prospect in that other country is still uncertain. For context, sending the dog overseas require vaccinations and costs and a month quarantine in that country - something that they deemed inappropriate as the sister may come back anytime (or may stay there for good). This has affected us for 1.5 months now and nothing has changed - it is starting to feel like a situation where my concerns are not respected because I was reasonably bearing with her and not cause trouble.

Last night I decided to press the issue. We got into a huge fight over how her ‚Äúbear with it until sister‚Äôs situation is certain‚Äù is a non-solution as there is no concrete timeline and how she was not giving me any other solution other than to ask me to remain status quo.

14,1d3rwrc,AITA for not staying with my boyfriend on his birthday?,"I(F25) usually stay over at my 
boyfriend's (30M) place twice a week. On Tuesday nights, he comes over to my house for dinner with my family, and then I drive us back to his apartment. I sleep there and leave early the next morning for work.

This past Wednesday was his birthday, and the plan was for me to go to his house Wednesday afternoon so we could then go to his parents' place for a birthday dinner.On Monday night, he mentioned he was super busy preparing for his birthday celebration with friends on Friday but would try to come over for dinner on Tuesday night.I told him it was fine if he couldn't make it since we‚Äôd see each other the next day, but he insisted on coming. I made it clear that if he came,I wouldn‚Äôt be staying over but would stick to our original plan of staying over on WednesdaY.

On Tuesday, we ended up arguing. He couldn't understand why I didn't want to stay two nights in a row, especially since he was making an effort to come over.I explained that staying over twice during the week is quite inconvenient for me: I have to drive us back to his house at night, get limited and restless sleep, wake up extra early to drive home, miss my workout,and feel tired all day. 

For him, staying over means he gets to have sex and cuddle,it doesn't change anything for him. I do all that and he doesn't even walk me to his house gate when I leave; he rolls over to keep on sleeping while I change and get out of his house.

I offered a compromise:I would stay over Tuesday night and only come for dinner on Wednesday. He didn't say anything to that but argued about another point.

When Tuesday night came, 
he arrived at my house for dinner with my dad. When I was ready to leave with him, he reminded me that I was supposed to stay over Wednesday, not Tuesday. I offered to go that night if he preferred, but he got visibly upset, saying he wanted me to stay both nights, and left the decision to me. He added that now we were both upset and wouldn't have a good time together.

I decided to stick to the original plan and stay Wednesday night.He argued that it was logical for me to stay both nights because it was his birthday, and I supposedly loved him. I reminded him I was already planning to stay Wednesday, Friday, and spend Sunday with him for his three birthday celebrations. I felt he was expecting too much and not being understanding.
I reassured him my not staying over didn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt love him and that I was doing as much as I could. He said ""ask any of your friends if it's logical for me to take the train home alone on my birthday eve instead of being with my girlfriend""I feel like a 30-year-old adult doesn't throw a tantrum for not getting his fourth bday celebration. 

We went in circles until we changed the topic. I drove him to the train station, and he took the 20-minute ride home while we texted and I kept reassuring him I loved him, feeling very guilty.

I reassured him my not staying over didn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt love him and that I was doing as much as I could. He said ""ask any of your friends if it's logical for me to take the train home alone on my birthday eve instead of being with my girlfriend""I feel like a 30-year-old adult doesn't throw a tantrum for not getting his fourth bday celebration. 

We went in circles until we changed the topic. I drove him to the train station, and he took the 20-minute ride home while we texted and I kept reassuring him I loved him, feeling very guilty.

15,1d3rvo6,AITA for asking my friend to pay me back for tickets because she cancelled the day before? ,"I (19F) got tickets for my friend (Mia, 20F) to see Hamilton in March 2023, to see the show in March 2024. We're both uni students and these tickets were not cheap but we've both wanted to see the show for years so I splurged on them. The day before the show Mia cancelled, saying that she's too stressed about the exams she had in a couple of months to go with me to see the show. 

I told Mia that I was really hurt, we'd been planning this for almost year and no other friends of mine were available this late notice and she apologised but also told me that the world doesn't revolve around me. I asked Mia to reimburse me for ‚Öì of the ticket (¬£20) since it was now essentially going to waste. She refused and my boyfriend ended up being able to join me for the show and we did have a great time. I never brought it up to Mia but I did see that she posted about a night out with her other friends the day after the show was supposed to be... 

Fast forward to now, I'd barely spoken to Mia over the exam season; partly because I've been busy and partly because I feel incredibly hurt by her actions. I saw that she'd said ""bye"" on Snapchat and when I went to respond I found that I'd been blocked. I texted her to ask her what was going on and she had basically said that she's offended I'd asked for money because ""friendships shouldn't be monetary"" and how money is a huge trigger for her. 

(I feel like I should clarify that if I knew she was anything but financially stable I wouldn't have asked for the money. But she and her family are very wealthy so I assumed it was fine.) 

Mia told me that she doesn't feel as though we can be friends after this, which makes me think I'm the bad guy here and should try and apologise?

16,1d3rpa8,AITA for threatening to move out if I don't have separate wi-fi than my roommate?,"I (22M), have lived with my roommate who we will call Dan (24M) for a while now, the two of us have had no major issues at all and we've been good friends for a while now. Dan generally handles the more social things like talking to the landlord and whatever, and this includes dealing with the internet provider and I give him my half of the money every month to pay for it. 

Now I feel it's pretty important to bring up that ever since we moved in together, Dan and I got along great. He seemed to always like the same things as me, work seamlessly around my plans and even tell when I was upset about things without even talking to me. I genuinely felt like we had an instant connection, i've never had a guy get me as easily as he did.

Things worked fine until Dan got a girlfriend. She's over all the time which I really don't care about, I just stay in my room and give them privacy whenever they want. it doesn't bother me. The issue is that apparently Dan has an app that allows him to control the internet with like parental controls or something and I guess she asked for access to it too. 

I didn't really realise or care until she started bringing up things that I was searching online. She was being very obvious about it too, asking how restaurants are that I looked up, spoiling one episode ahead of shows I was watching, she even bought a dice set I was looking at and gifted it to Dan right in front of me.

When I realised what was happening I brought it up with Dan, trying to communicate like a reasonable adult about how uncomfortable I was, he asked why I had a problem with her doing it and not him.

Turns out Dan has been watching what I'm searching for months, his girlfriend is just less subtle about it, and we are such good friends because he is lying about having the same interests as me. 

I told him that I was in no way okay with it and told him I was getting my own wi-fi, but he insisted it would cause issues with the IP address or something and I needed to stay on his no matter what. So I told him I was going to move out if I couldn't, because I am not okay with this at all. 

For those of you already typing that he can 100% see this. I hope he does. I want him to know this isn't okay, but apparently he would rather stalk my internet history than talk to me and get to know me.

18,1d3rbf9,AITA for not wanting to take are of my step-son?,"Let me start by saying my husband is a terrible father to our 2 year old. He runs off to his friends house every chance he gets and has no patience when it comes to caring for her. He yells at her for any little thing and complains when he has to spend more than a few hours with her. He's your typical blue collar ignorant guy that thinks his job as a husband and father starts and stops with working 10 hour days to support his family. I was love bombed by him and I'm pretty unhappily married but I'm stuck for the time being.

When we first started dating he did tell me that his ex had a kid that may or may not be his. He dated this chick, they went on a break, then she came back and said she was pregnant but wasn't 100 perfect sure if it was his. He took her back anyway and raised this kid for 2 years then they broke up and he exited the picture when she got serious with her now husband. So he says.

She reached out to him a few weeks ago and said that she's getting divorced and her mom has cancer so she quit her job to care for her mother and now needs help from him financially and physically because said child is now 7 years old and is autistic, non verbal, and not potty trained. 

She sent a picture and this child looks like his twin so yes it's his. I also just learned his name is on the birth certificate so he's for sure on the hook financially. I told him to that he needs to talk with her and figure out child support outside of court so we don't get stuck paying the $800 a month that the state recommends. I also told him to think long and hard about how much responsibility he is going to have as a parent to a special needs child. I told him that I was absolutely not going to be stuck watching our toddler and an autistic 7 year old for him while he runs off to his friends house every weekend. I said that he will be the sole party responsible for this child I made it clear that I was not going to do any pick ups/drop offs or care for the child without him present. He rarely lifts a finger to help me with our kid so I am damn well not going to help with his other child. 

I'm not saying I am going to treat this child poorly. I will welcome him with open arms in my home and feed him and care for him alongside my child so long as my husband remains at home and spends time with him. I know my husband does not have the personality to deal with children let alone one with special needs so I'm trying to clearly communicate my boundaries so that he doesn't use me as a babysitter.
