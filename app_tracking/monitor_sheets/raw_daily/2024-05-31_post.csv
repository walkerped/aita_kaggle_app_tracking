0,1d50dx2,AITA for correcting my uncle at a birthday party?,"I (17M) went to a birthday party for my cousin, Red, (8M) hosted by his stepfather, Bruno, (32M) and his other parent, Tulip, (36 AFAB NonBinary) with my mom, dad, older sister, and little brother. Their ages aren't important. It was pokemon themed and I've played pokemon for about 3 years to this point while reading a lot of the manga.  
  
One of the games at the party was a game of 'name a pokemon, if it's repeated or it's not real then you're out,' for cheap and easy prizes just as a time filler. Red wanted me, my sister, and my brother to play so we said yes and there I was, one of three teenagers next to one adult and about ten kids in elementary school. We're about midway through the game when my sister says Dunsparce. That goes through. I say Dudunsparce and I'm eliminated. Uncle Bruno tells me that I said ""The Dunsparce"". I don't want to cause a stir so I head out and the kids are still having fun.  
  
it goes down to the final three and one of Red's friends, Green, says Iron Boulder. Bruno eliminates her because that he's sure that it isn't a pokemon. I ask him ""Hey, can you verify that Iron Boulder is a pokemon?"" Uncle Bruno is insistent so I pull up my phone and show him Iron Boulder. Uncle Bruno apologizes and lets Green back in the game. It goes from a friend named Blue (Klink), to another friend, Yellow (Klang), to Green again, and Green says Klinklang. Uncle Bruno tries eliminating Green again and I have to intervene by showing Bruno what Klingklang looks like. Bruno gets frustrated but lets her in. Eventually Green wins.  
  
Uncle bruno confronts me after and says that I didn't have to embarrass him in front of all the other kids. I'm confused and say ""I just wanted the kids to experience a fair game when you weren't giving them one."" Bruno says that I could have pulled him aside instead of publically countering him when he tried to do his judgement. I say that his judgement was flawed because not only were Iron Boulder and Klinklang pokemon, Dudunsparce is a pokemon too. I show him all three of them and he huffs and storms off to Tulip.  
  
The rest of the party goes rather well, but on the ride home my parents ask me what the kerfuffle was. I say that It was because Uncle Bruno didn't use his best judgement and wasn't judging the game fairly. Dad has no opinion on the subject because he was basically in the bathroom the entire party and mom says that I did a good thing trying to stand up for the kids, but I didn't need to argue that loudly with Bruno. I say that I didn't really shout that loud and it was unfair regardless. Mom says that I still need to apologize for publically calling him out but I point out that Uncle Bruno still hasn't apologized. Mom says that I should just try to keep the peace.

1,1d4n2og,AITA for telling my family I don't want to get senior photos?,"Hi Reddit. I'II start with background info before delving into the scenario. I am a transgender male (17) and I will be a High School senior this August. I live with a family of 3 (aunt, grandpa, and grandma) and my mom lives separately, but I only see her on weekends. She has full custody of me and we have a severely strained relationship since I was a toddler. I won't dig into the depths of our relationship - but she is very controlling, insecure, and abusive. I am closeted about my identity with my mother. My grandfather and grandmother are not as content with it. Only my aunt is slightly more receptive and I say she's alright with it. Right now it is my summer break and my school is sending out letters to make our appointments for senior photos.

SCENARIO: My aunt and grandpa were recently told by our neighbors that her son received an e-mail about senior photos. However, my mom has no awareness of this yet as she pretty much acts absent in my life but only will get involved to manipulate things for me.

My aunt called me out of my room and told me that my mom needs to make my appointment for senior photos soon. I asked her that if there is a possibility I can do it once I turn 18 (in January). The reason why I want to do it at 18 is because my mom WILL force me to dress as my biological sex and that means I have to detransition for my photos. I know she will do this because she is severely controlling of my appearance and has done this multiple times recently - like my birthday photos. I am uncomfortable with how I look as my hair is cut in a pixie-mullet, and my mom will force me to appear feminine in those photos (wearing a dress and makeup). I want to be able to have photos that represent the real me than the fantasy my mom wants. Plus, my deadname will be plastered over these photos which I do not want.

I expressed this concern to my aunt, then my grandpa and her chimed in, began raising their voices at me, and calling me an asshole for only expressing my concerns. I stated my concerns maturely and calmly, and they began telling me that I have no concern for others and l'm acting like an ass because I'm being ""wayward."" They are well aware of my poor relationship with my mother and her behaviors, yet they still treat my concerns as if I'm overreacting. My voice level was not even as loud as theirs, and they started yelling the moment I spoke. I cannot stand up to them furthermore because they constantly belittle my words. 

My wish is to have my senior year to represent myself than what my mom wants to see from me. My words to my mom and my other family members have no value to them. They disregard and gaslight me when I speak up for myself and always have since I was little. As an adult, I will have more liberties to tailor my appearance and have more lead in getting these photos done. Am I the Asshole?

For some background, we have had amazing training for our dog since we got him at 8 weeks old. He still has his moments as we are still and always will be training him but he responds to voice commands very well. My sister in laws dog has never had formal training and is honestly a menace. He is very overly protective of her and Grammy and will attack people and dogs who come too close. Since we got our dog after she did, our dog has been with hers at family events since he was a puppy. Well at first they were fine together but now her dog goes after ours for no reason and our dog will sometimes snap as most dogs would. However our dog is bigger and could potentially hurt her dog if he went farther than a quick snap back. Now here is the issue. My sister in law doesn’t want our dog in the house (Grammys house) if she is home with her dog (she lives a plane ride away). This past Christmas our dog wasn’t allowed because she threw a fit so I had to stay home with our dog. I was alone for hours on Christmas. So my partner and I stated we would fight to work on the dogs relationship so that he (our dog) wouldn’t have to be stuck at home every time my sister in law comes home. Well she is home now with her dog (she will never leave her dog at a boarding facility so he always comes home with her). We went over with our dog and we asked if we could have the dogs together in the house for a little bit to work on training. Well my sister in law doesn’t even want to attempt to train her dog or work on the dogs relationship therefore our dog will always be stuck at home for family events.

Tracy was to drive some of us to a pizza parlor in Westham, while Ariana ordered an Uber for the rest. Due to a mistake, Ariana selected a location in Eastham instead.

At the party, everyone, except Ariana who claimed she wasn’t drinking, indulged in some underaged drinking. During this time, Ariana confessed her romantic feelings for me to Baileigh without naming me but with clear hints. I had a complicated past with a boy named James (17M), who spread rumors about me, tarnishing my reputation. Ariana said it would be embarrassing to date me because of these rumors.

Tracy drove Hannah, James, and Aria to the correct pizza parlor, while I, Baileigh, and Ariana ended up at the wrong one. Despite her earlier claims, Ariana had secretly been drinking and left her purse in the Uber, which had her house keys. The Uber driver agreed to return it but would take three hours. Ariana insisted we wait instead of going to her house directly.

When we realized the mistake, I asked Tracy to pick us up, but she only responded if we would pay for gas. We waited for an hour in the rain outside the closed parlor. Baileigh suggested I use my connections to get us a ride home, so I contacted my friend Thomas (17M), who agreed to help. Thomas arrived before the Uber returned with Ariana's purse. Despite my urging, Ariana wanted to wait for the Uber. Baileigh reassured me it was okay to leave, giving me her house keys and I gave her my jacket for warmth.

The next day, I learned that Baileigh accused me of ""wh*ring myself out"" to Thomas to get a ride, which was untrue. I was subsequently labeled with numerous derogatory terms. Baileigh called me selfish for not understanding her unspoken expectations.

We've been friends for almost 3 years as well. love him dearly, but have been getting upset because he tends to do things or get things for me that HE likes, but not what like. For my birthday, he got tons of mismatching balloons and decorations and wrote weird and silly things on my cake. But don't enjoy random weirdness and humor when it comes to my birthday, like a neatly decorated and themed birthday. I told him l'd love something pink and gold with pretty balloons, not superheros and little boys balloons. He thought it was hilarious and said he would have loved it for himself. 

He once surprised me with milkshakes. For context: HATE chocolate. I've mentioned it countless times. But he came home with two chocolate milkshakes and said how ungrateful was for not drinking mine. I asked him to write down what like and dislike in his phone to help him remember. He just stayed silent 

Today, he came home for lunch with taco bell. don't like spicy food, but love the nacho fries with nacho cheese. He pulls them out with two containers of spicy ranch. I asked if he had any nacho cheese but he said no, just the spicy ranch. I asked why and he said ""because like spicy ranch?"". I reminded him that don't like spicy stuff and that I've always had nacho fries with cheese. politely, calmly, and somewhat sadly asked him again to please write down what like and dislike. He yelled and said he has a bad memory and can't remember to write stuff down. I told him to write it down when it comes up and then he doesn't have to remember anything except to check his notes. 

He hasn't spoken to me since l asked that and I'm starting to feel so hopeless. I feel like I'm asking too much, but want to feel like he cares about what like and don't like. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just an extension of him instead of my own person with my own wants. I want to feel like I can share my feelings without being punished with the silent treatment.

I reminded him that don't like spicy stuff and that I've always had nacho fries with cheese. politely, calmly, and somewhat sadly asked him again to please write down what like and dislike. He yelled and said he has a bad memory and can't remember to write stuff down. I told him to write it down when it comes up and then he doesn't have to remember anything except to check his notes. 

He hasn't spoken to me since l asked that and I'm starting to feel so hopeless. I feel like I'm asking too much, but want to feel like he cares about what like and don't like. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just an extension of him instead of my own person with my own wants. I want to feel like I can share my feelings without being punished with the silent treatment.

TLDR: AITA for asking my boyfriend to write these things down since he can't remember? How do I ask for things without hurting his feelings or making him feel stupid?

9,1d4ju6y,AITA for confronting my parents about their pettiness over my brother not mowing the lawn?,"I 20f have shared an apartment with my 23m brother for the last 7 months. We come from a very nontraditional household, but I won't get into all the details because a lot of what I have to say is biased. Regardless, though only three years apart, my brother and I were raised by very different standards and we are very different people for it. I'm much more outspoken than he is and due to some severe childhood trauma, he had always just done whatever my parents have told him to do. Never asked, just told   
After he became my roommate he started pushing back. Unfortunately, it's still been an expectation that on his days off of work, he goes to their house and does just about anything they ask of him.   


My parents are 53 & 60. My step mom brought 4 of her own adult children to the table. Two of which live with my parents, and my step sister has two kids that are 13 & 12. They're more than old enough to being some kind of chores like dishes or at least their own laundry. But instead my brother is expected to be there doing everything. It's seriously ridiculous.   
He's absolutely fed up with this. He can't ever see his girlfriend, he never has time to clean his own space or cook his own meals. And worst of all, after getting off the phone with my mom yesterday, I found out that my parents are excluding him from an out of state family trip to go see some of our relatives. 

This is a trip my step mom goes on every year. And even when no one else can go, my brother has ALWAYS made time for it. But for the first time in at least five years, my dad is actually going.

They just expected him to be there and when he wasn't they didn't tell him, but instead my step mom told ME on the phone that my brother was no longer going on this pre-planned trip. 

  
My next day off is Sunday and I plan on  going to their house and telling them off for being petty and ridiculous. It's not really my place to get involved, but my step mom involved me the minute she told me and not my brother. He's reasonably upset over this, especially considering the relatives he was going to see are getting to the age where we could lose them at any time.

While I (18, male) do interact with people outside my group, they respect my boundaries and never try to join. However, in the last few months, Sarah has tried to join us. Sarah is a very quiet person compared to the rest of us, and her presence has made things awkward. My friends and I dislike confrontations, so we've tolerated her presence until it became unbearable over the past two weeks. She has been invading my personal space and secretly bad-mouthing one of my closest friends.

Today, Sarah texted me, asking if my friend Bella (18, female) has feelings for Carter (19, male), which I found very strange. During our conversation, she mentioned feeling sorry for barging into our group uninvited. I responded honestly, ""My group has been four for a long time, and while I respect you, it can be challenging with five of us. I appreciate your understanding.""

The discussion escalated as she struggled to grasp that she should leave. Eventually, I suggested, ""It might be good for you to branch out and talk to more people than just us."" She replied that she only hangs out with us at lunch but is aware of our business. I reiterated, ""I understand, but this could be beneficial for you. You could interact with multiple groups and decide who you want to spend time with each day.Besides, you also hang out with us during passing periods.""

11,1d4jcly,WIBTA for not reimbursing my roommate for rent because she's leaving halfway through the month,"Throw away because I don't want this being connected to my normal account.  
So my roommate who I am not on good terms with is moving out halfway through June. We were just discussing the lease addendum to take her off and she noticed the move out date. The lease will be updated for July 1st. I'll call her Claire, and I'll preface that this conversation happened through text.  
Claire: ""Hey that's not my move out date""  
Me: ""I know, legally you're responsible until month end but you can leave whenever""  
Claire: ""They better not be charging me the whole amount for rent""  
At this point I got confused, but not surprised by the comment based on our past interactions. I didn't say anything.  
Claire: ""Are they charging me for the whole month??""  
Me: ""Yes""  
Claire: ""Are you going to reimburse me for the rest?""  
After I saw this I kind of just went, what the hell. For more information, she is moving out willingly, and decided to move out mid month on her own volition. I know she can't make me reimburse her legally as I am in the right. I NEVER agreed or implied I would reimburse her for her moving out mid month. Prorated it would be around $300 that would be owed back to her.  
As we aren't on good terms, and she has made the apartment awful to live in, I do not want to reimburse her. On the other hand, I hate conflict, and she won't be living here. She will still owe me for utilities and now I'm worried she'll try not to pay them for this month (especially the power bill since it is may's power bill, and it is high due to our EPP being paid out). I already planned to prorate June's bills as she'll be leaving which is fair.

It’s not something that came up in the beginning of the relationship and is just something I came to notice. She had NO friends. I mean not even one single friend. She has 6 sisters and 1 brother and they are an extremely close family and hang a lot but no outside friends.

When I first brought this up to her she used the excuses, that she didn’t move here until 15 and switched multiple schools, was poor and bullied often. She didn’t go to college so she said she couldn’t make friends then.

I asked about work and she said she had work friends but keeps work and private life completely separate. I told her she doesn’t think it’s weird or she’s missing out on something to have no friends at all? She said not really because she considers her family her friends. 

I kinda pushed and was like to never have a friend in your life is a red flag, she started crying and saying I’m an AH. That it’s not that easy to make friends, and that the state we are from everyone has grown up together. I said well I mean you met me, so how hard can it be.

16,1d4isvv,AITA for not attending a funeral?,"Last week, a girl I (20) went to high school with and played basketball with (we'll call her Ava) passed away tragically at 22. Ava was two grades above me and we both played the same sport (as a senior she was varsity and as a sophomore I was JV). She was also my ""basketball sister"", which is when an upperclassman is assigned an underclassman to kind of take under their wing for the year so varsity didn't seem as intimidating. This was in 2018-2019 when Ava was my basketball sister and we got close, but not best friends close. My best friend, Lilly (now 21), was closer with Ava since she was on varsity as a sophomore and had a lot of the same close friends as Ava, but they were never super close. Ava was the sweetest person to everyone and no one could say anything bad about her. There is no doubt about that, but we just didn't happen to be all that close. Ava graduated in 2019 and Lilly and I never really kept in contact with Ava after that.

Fast forward to last week when everyone got the news that Ava had passed. I found out on Wednesday morning while I was at work, and Lilly had found out the day before from another friend who Ava was close with. Since it happened so suddenly there was no news of a funeral date anytime soon. All of this was a couple days before a holiday weekend and I had plans to visit my long distance boyfriend (21) for the weekend to be with his family. I was staying there Thursday-Tuesday.

For some added context, Lilly has never been a huge fan of my boyfriend which I don't blame her for because he has made some mistakes in our relationship but she tends to take it too far sometimes. For example, if I post on Instagram or Tiktok and he is in the post, she wont like it. She'll roll her eyes any time I mention him and tends to talk bad about him quite a lot in front of me. Like I said, I don't blame her but I would be lying if I said this didn't get under my skin sometimes.

Anyways, I found out on Saturday that her funeral was going to be on Monday morning (ending at noon) via a Facebook post. Since I was approximately 3 hours away from home and hadn't heard from anyone else in my circle that they were going, I didn't change any of the plans I had with my boyfriend's family that week. On Monday at 11:40 am I got a text from Lilly saying, ""Are you not coming to Ava's funeral?"". I responded, ""I had stuff planned with \[boyfriend's\] family or else I would've been there. How is it going?"". Her response was a thumbs-down reaction to my text. I haven't heard anything from her since and she's been leaving all of my other social media messages on read (one's not related to the funeral). I feel horrible for not being there but I also feel like it's not fair to be mad at me when I didn't even know that Lilly was going. AITA?

And me and lil bro were helping clean up to be nice, I asked my lil bro if he could please move out of the way of the dish washer for a sec (he was putting dishes in it) so I could put my extra dishes in, he told me “no” and too “cope and seethe” I rolled my eyes and carried on, like 2 minutes later I asked my mom if there was anything else I could do to help and she said I could put the shreded cheese into a baggie, now beside the dishwasher there are drawers were we keep stuff like small bags, since my lil brother was still in the way and he had told me to “cope and seethe” after I asked him to move 2 minutes ago I didn’t bother asking this time, and he tried to slam my hand in the drawer, I screamed and I blew a fuse because my brother had just tired to slam my hand in the drawer , and for some reason everyone got mad at me for freaking out even though my little brother just tried to slam my hand in the drawer, meanwhile he was claiming I should have just asked him to move out of the way, (bruh I asked you two minutes ago and you told me to “cope and seethe”) my mom just Said “I hear you and I believe  you but you need to stop escalating, I’m still eating and it’s my anniversary” I screamed at everyone (Exept my big bro’s gf because she’s really nice and she tries to stay nutrual in these situations) in short I stormed off and like 5 minutes later my mom told me in short I was the problem because I  escalated the situation and that it wasn’t fair to her because I “ruined” the dinner after I pointed out how it wasn’t fair that I was punished for freaking out because my brother tried to hurt me.
